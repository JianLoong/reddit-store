From last 1 year we are living together so everything was split 60-40 because I was making more than her. Now my gf is very hardworking she started working in part time jobs from the age of 17 put herself through college with very minimal help from her parents and student loans. After working for 3 years straight 9-5 without taking any vacation without spending on makeup/clothes she paid off her complete debt last month And I can visibly see how relax she is. Couple of days ago we were cuddling and she told me that she is feeling very burn out and that she wants to take a break from her working life to stay at home for 7-8 months and to work on herself (gyming, hiking,gaming, movies/tv shows, etc) just to decompress. I asked her if she wants to to take vacation or something but she said No she just want to stay at home doing minimal things. Then she asked if I am willing to pay 90% of our joint expenses because she doesn't have enough savings that'll last for 8 months and i said i don't have any Debt so I am pretty okay with it.\n\nYesterday I told her that if she is going to be at home for next 8 months then house chores should split 20-80% before it was 50-50. Bcs I have to put more hours at work to make sure I earn sufficient amount for both of us but to my surprise this triggered her and she said I am being unfair and milking out the situation which led to a small argument.

Hell nah!", "Her: \"I want to do what I want and for you to pay for it all\"\n\nYou: Absolutely NTA. HUGE red flag.", "NTA in this situation. If she wants you to support her very extended holiday, she could at least pick up the chores. \n\nShe sounds rather entitled. I couldn\u2019t imagine telling my partner that I\u2019m giving up work so you can support me.", "NTa My dude and I don't know but this seems like a huge red flag to me like she is going to be SAHP without any work it's like Trap to me. After this interaction i would even rescind the 90% offer if it was my Gf. Best of luck to you", "NTA. Relationships should wherever possible be relationships of equal contribution in terms of effort/work. The person who works fewer hours in employment should contribute more of the work in the home, because they have more free time.\n\nObviously there may be times where one should step up more out of decency, such as if the other partner becomes ill. But this isn't that.\n\nWorking part time through college and 9-5 after college is pretty normal. It's not like she's been working 80 hours a week.\n\nNow she's asking you to be the one to work more than full time hours, so she can take a break from working normal full time hours? That doesn't really make sense. If she wants to take a break, she should wait and do it when she has enough savings so that you don't have to work more hours to cover it.\n\nTaking care of, what I'm guessing is an apartment and not a huge house, with no kids, isn't hard at all. A couple of hours a day. I'd be thrilled for the opportunity to just spend a couple of hours a day on housework and not have to work! \n\nBut she's not willing to do even that, while expecting you to work more hours to fund her time off. I think you need to ask yourself if that's the attitude that someone who believes in equal partnership would have.", "NTA\n\nShe is being lazy\n\nIt is only fair if you are having to work more to bring more in that she covers the bulk of the house work.\n\nMassive red flag my friend.", "NTA You're very generous to say you'll cover almost everything. I worry your kindness may get you in trouble here. You wanting her to do more around the house sounds like a hell of a deal. I would think she'd want to help offset the extra workload you'll be taking on, by taking over the vast majority of the housework. \n\nIf anyone is \"milking it,\" it's her.", "So she wanna quit working, you to pay 90% of the bills and still do 50% of the house work?? Is he listen to herself? \nFirst: if she doesnt have the savings that allows her to stop working for 8 months, she shouldnt do it.\nSecond: if she wants to be basicly a SAHWife she has to bring her part of the deal, which is the house work. Simple as that. \nShe basicly wants you to pay for 8 months of doing nothing. She is not sick, she is not pregnant or watching a child/invalide person, she is not studying!! She has no reason not to do the house work (or even stop working for so long).\nYour offer was more than fair. If she doesnt want it, she can keep working. \n\nNTA", "That\u2019s a nice dream for someone who isn\u2019t independently wealthy.  You are NTA 80/20 is the correct split for this situation.  She would leave the workforce voluntarily without adequate resources to cover her expenses for the period she expects to not be generating income.  Her contribution to daily life doesn\u2019t stop just because she is earning no income.", "NTA and in 8 months she wont want to go back to work and you will be the sap paying all the bills and doing all the chores.", "NTA. I think your request is fair and she sounds entitled. She wants you to work full time to financially support her and also do all of the work at home for her. She talks about feeling burnt out and tired but doesn\u2019t respect that you probably feel tired too.", "NTA and a very big red flag from your gf tbh. She wants you to pay for 90% of things for 8 months but won\u2019t take up 20% of the housework? That should tell you a lot. Stand your ground on that and don\u2019t let her entitlement put you in a bad space too. You\u2019re going to be working way harder than before to cover for you both. She should be willing to pick up extra housework in exchange", "Info: is she possibly burnt out? Should like she needs a check up at the doctor's office.", "NTA - Run away.", "NTA. You are putting a financial value on the chores. She wants you to take on an extra 30% of the joint expenses because she has insufficient savings for an 8 month break, and you have asked her to take on an extra 30% of the chores for that duration. Unless you are incredibly messy, those extra chores will still leave her lots of personal time to unwind. \n\nI'd have a few questions for her. \n\n* How has she decided on the 7-8 months for her decompression period? \n* What will she do if you have an issue, like you lose your job because of restructuring etc or due to sudden ill health? Would she be willing to go straight back to work if you ended up out of work without income unable to get another job straight away?\n* How does she intend to cover her 10% of the joint expenses, and any personal expenses, during the break from work? You've stated that it was just a few weeks ago she finished of paying off her debt. So how much money will she have to tide her over (I'm not asking for specific figure, just has that short time since paying off her debt also allowed her to build up some savings as a financial safety net?) or is she going to put herself back into debt to cover any of her expenses during her break?\n* Why doesn't she use her leave entitlement/PTO? (Depending on where in the world you live, and the type of business she works for, she might not have much entitlement, but on the other hand she might have time built up.)\n* Is she going to take an unpaid break from work, or is she quitting? If she is quitting, at which point does she intend to start looking for a new job? What guarantee will there be that she's only going to be not working for the 7-8 month period she's stated.", "End it", "Nah. She is never going to go back to work.  Use condoms bc an \u201coops\u201d pregnancy will be next.", "NTA, partners work together to share life's burdens. Her ask is outrageous. She is not your child. The gap in her resume will make her far less employable, finding a job is way more stressful than having a job. What happens in 8 months when she needs a job and  cannot get one? A pregnancy maybe?\n\nIf one partner stays home their job is to do all of the housrwork. If one partner works fewer hours their job is to pick up the slack so the other partner has less of a load.\n\nI took a few months break in my late 20s to change direction. I saved enough money to pay my way during that break and took on all of the housework so my bf, now husband, could also experience a break by only having to work his job and not work around the house too. \n\nYour resentment will grow into hate for your gf if you have to pay all the bills and do housework while she concentrates her energy on herself. She is not your child.", "So she doesn't want to work, wants you to pay 90% of the bills and do all of the housework. She's trying to take you for a mug mate.", "An easy NTA good for your gf to be debt free but that work she has done for herself does not mean she gets to leech of off you now. You probably live in a relatively small house, you most likely do not have kids. As if cooking and cleaning is so much to ask for in that scenario of yours. You are 100 % in the right assuming the information you gave is correct.", "NAH\nBut she did ask for it coz she's close to full burnout. Full burnout literally can cause brain damage and can take between 3-5 years to recover from. If she's pre burnout, it can look a lot like depression, except you *need* to rest. Forcing yourself to work through it can literally damage you and make the recovery time longer.\n\nShe probably feels like she asked for her to be able to lean on you, and now it feels transactional to her, like you won't help support her in illness unless you're getting something out of it. That's not necessarily realistic, but emotions aren't and burnout heightens negative emotions. She probably feels a bit abandoned by you right now. Like she asked you to catch her falling of a cliff and you said \"of course honey, but only if you cook me dinner\" (again not what happened but how Im guessing she feels) \n\nSo, personally, I'd suggest a compromise. She wants to be off for around 8 months, right? Could you give her 3 months paying the extra expenses and keeping things how they are, and then she takes on more housework to make it equitable? But so she has a chance to rest and rebuild her reserves. \n(if she had broken her leg, would you feel differently? Probably. That's because we do better when we can *see* the damage as humans. But burnout can literally cause brain damage, so it is serious) \n\nI also suggest she gets her hormones (thyroid and sexual, cortizol and vitamin D (which is actually a hormone) ) checked out, coz women's hormones can easily be disbalanced due to stress (cortizol) and that can lead to chronic fatigue and burnout symptoms. If she's been on hormonal BC for more than 2 years, she should also go off it for 6 months, coz prolonged use of hormonal BC also leads to chronic fatigue in women. \nShe should also check her mineral and vitamin levels, coz pushing herself the way she did for so long has probably depleted her reserves and that also exacerbates tiredness and burnout.\n\nHope this helps.", "You wrote you saw how relaxed she was. And she wants to relax a little more. You, considering how important she is to you, had to answer yes or no and face the consequences. In my opinion, adults, including you and your girlfriend, work 9-5 all the time. This world is not fair and some have to work for longer hours for more than 30 years. So, working just for 3 years without vacation doesn't grant the right to rest for months. The money we earn and the people supporting us grant. In your case, it is you. Decide considering things such as, how much you love her, she wouldn't probably want to work at all in the future, your plans for your future, how much you earn, if you want to marry her, what would happen when you are married and have children, etc. So, your response can be considered as an AH move because your response is just about yourself,  not your relationship. You need to talk to her about your future.", "NAH. In this scenario, there is a person who is generally right and a person who is generally wrong, but being wrong doesn\u2019t automatically make a person an asshole. It seems like the way you both are handling this conversation shows a lot of openness, honesty, and maturity. And you should both be commended for that. \n\nOP, your request is completely fair. If you\u2019re going to be taking on the financial burden for both of you, it\u2019s reasonable for you to want some give-and-take. Changing the division of labor around the house in order to offset the earning imbalance makes sense. It would also make sense for you to ask her to come up with a long term plan and discuss it with you, so that her 8 month sabbatical doesn\u2019t turn into a year, then two years, then ten years. You guys seem to communicate well, so figuring out those details together shouldn\u2019t be too difficult a task. \n\nFrom your girlfriend\u2019s perspective, if she\u2019s so burnt out from her working situation that she feels she needs that much time off, I can imagine that it\u2019s all taken a major toll on her mentally. Maybe she\u2019s not thinking totally clearly and the idea of taking on a lot of housework feels intimidating at first, when all of her energy is totally sapped. But it seems like the idea of her break is that it would allow her to reset and deal with the burnt-out feeling. So in theory, once work is behind her, she should start to have more drive and motivation again soon. That energy can go toward taking on more of the chores around the house. And the nice thing about most chores is that they don\u2019t have to be addressed in a rigid way like work tasks do. She can, in a sense, \u201cmake her own schedule\u201d to do things on her time, as long as those chores ultimately get done. \n\nPerhaps there can be an agreement that the 80-20 chore split doesn\u2019t happen right away. If you\u2019re up to it OP, you can offer that her first two weeks away from work are a \u201cvacation.\u201d She keeps her current chores but the rest of her time is totally hers. She can do whatever she needs to start getting her energy back. And then after a couple weeks, when she\u2019s got some proverbial gas in the tank, she starts taking on 80% of the domestic responsibilities. \n\nAt the end of the day, the important thing here is that both of you seem to have communicated your needs in a mature and calm way. This is a big ask on her part, in a time when she\u2019s feeling very mentally drained, and even then it didn\u2019t lead to some massive fight. You say it was just a minor disagreement, which indicates that both of you do a very good job of addressing things together. \n\nSince nobody in this scenario became mean, and everyone communicated their needs maturely, there\u2019s definitely no asshole in this situation. Even though her requests are a bit unrealistic and you\u2019re certainly the person who is in the right.", "Yta to yourself.", "YTA. You just give off bad vibes, it\u2019s completely personal.", "So, your GF needs to take time off work to relax and recover from working her ass off for 9 years, 3 without a vacation and likely few days off, and your response is for her to do most of the housework?  \n\n\nYTA", "You\u2019re not being an asshole but just a bit of a jerk. She\u2019s your gf and your making the whole thing sound transactional.\n\nShe\u2019s doing this to work on herself and she won\u2019t be able to if her time is now dedicated to being your house wife, maybe split the work 60-40 instead. If things get hard you can readdress the situation but don\u2019t just outright burden her with the bulk of the work, tell her that you need to keep this line of communication open as you\u2019re concerned that you will burnout as well.
