From last 1 year we are living together so everything was split 60-40 because I was making more than her. Now my gf is very hardworking she started working in part time jobs from the age of 17 put herself through college with very minimal help from her parents and student loans. After working for 3 years straight 9-5 without taking any vacation without spending on makeup/clothes she paid off her complete debt last month And I can visibly see how relax she is. Couple of days ago we were cuddling and she told me that she is feeling very burn out and that she wants to take a break from her working life to stay at home for 7-8 months and to work on herself (gyming, hiking,gaming, movies/tv shows, etc) just to decompress. I asked her if she wants to to take vacation or something but she said No she just want to stay at home doing minimal things. Then she asked if I am willing to pay 90% of our joint expenses because she doesn't have enough savings that'll last for 8 months and i said i don't have any Debt so I am pretty okay with it.\n\nYesterday I told her that if she is going to be at home for next 8 months then house chores should split 20-80% before it was 50-50. Bcs I have to put more hours at work to make sure I earn sufficient amount for both of us but to my surprise this triggered her and she said I am being unfair and milking out the situation which led to a small argument.

After this interaction i would even rescind the 90% offer if it was my Gf. Best of luck to you", "NTA. Relationships should wherever possible be relationships of equal contribution in terms of effort/work. The person who works fewer hours in employment should contribute more of the work in the home, because they have more free time.\n\nObviously there may be times where one should step up more out of decency, such as if the other partner becomes ill. But this isn't that.\n\nWorking part time through college and 9-5 after college is pretty normal. It's not like she's been working 80 hours a week.\n\nNow she's asking you to be the one to work more than full time hours, so she can take a break from working normal full time hours? That doesn't really make sense. If she wants to take a break, she should wait and do it when she has enough savings so that you don't have to work more hours to cover it.\n\nTaking care of, what I'm guessing is an apartment and not a huge house, with no kids, isn't hard at all. A couple of hours a day. I'd be thrilled for the opportunity to just spend a couple of hours a day on housework and not have to work! \n\nBut she's not willing to do even that, while expecting you to work more hours to fund her time off.

She wants you to take on an extra 30% of the joint expenses because she has insufficient savings for an 8 month break, and you have asked her to take on an extra 30% of the chores for that duration. Unless you are incredibly messy, those extra chores will still leave her lots of personal time to unwind. \n\nI'd have a few questions for her. \n\n* How has she decided on the 7-8 months for her decompression period? \n* What will she do if you have an issue, like you lose your job because of restructuring etc or due to sudden ill health? Would she be willing to go straight back to work if you ended up out of work without income unable to get another job straight away?\n* How does she intend to cover her 10% of the joint expenses, and any personal expenses, during the break from work? You've stated that it was just a few weeks ago she finished of paying off her debt. So how much money will she have to tide her over (I'm not asking for specific figure, just has that short time since paying off her debt also allowed her to build up some savings as a financial safety net?) or is she going to put herself back into debt to cover any of her expenses during her break?\n* Why doesn't she use her leave entitlement/PTO? (Depending on where in the world you live, and the type of business she works for, she might not have much entitlement, but on the other hand she might have time built up.)\n* Is she going to take an unpaid break from work, or is she quitting? If she is quitting, at which point does she intend to start looking for a new job? What guarantee will there be that she's only going to be not working for the 7-8 month period she's stated.", "End it", "Nah. She is never going to go back to work.  Use condoms bc an \u201coops\u201d pregnancy will be next.", "NTA, partners work together to share life's burdens. Her ask is outrageous. She is not your child. The gap in her resume will make her far less employable, finding a job is way more stressful than having a job. What happens in 8 months when she needs a job and  cannot get one? A pregnancy maybe?\n\nIf one partner stays home their job is to do all of the housrwork. If one partner works fewer hours their job is to pick up the slack so the other partner has less of a load.\n\nI took a few months break in my late 20s to change direction. I saved enough money to pay my way during that break and took on all of the housework so my bf, now husband, could also experience a break by only having to work his job and not work around the house too. \n\nYour resentment will grow into hate for your gf if you have to pay all the bills and do housework while she concentrates her energy on herself. She is not your child.", "So she doesn't want to work, wants you to pay 90% of the bills and do all of the housework. She's trying to take you for a mug mate.", "An easy NTA good for your gf to be debt free but that work she has done for herself does not mean she gets to leech of off you now. You probably live in a relatively small house, you most likely do not have kids. As if cooking and cleaning is so much to ask for in that scenario of yours. You are 100 % in the right assuming the information you gave is correct.", "NAH\nBut she did ask for it coz she's close to full burnout. Full burnout literally can cause brain damage and can take between 3-5 years to recover from. If she's pre burnout, it can look a lot like depression, except you *need* to rest. Forcing yourself to work through it can literally damage you and make the recovery time longer.\n\nShe probably feels like she asked for her to be able to lean on you, and now it feels transactional to her, like you won't help support her in illness unless you're getting something out of it. That's not necessarily realistic, but emotions aren't and burnout heightens negative emotions. She probably feels a bit abandoned by you right now. Like she asked you to catch her falling of a cliff and you said \"of course honey, but only if you cook me dinner\" (again not what happened but how Im guessing she feels) \n\nSo, personally, I'd suggest a compromise. She wants to be off for around 8 months, right? Could you give her 3 months paying the extra expenses and keeping things how they are, and then she takes on more housework to make it equitable? But so she has a chance to rest and rebuild her reserves. \n(if she had broken her leg, would you feel differently? Probably. That's because we do better when we can *see* the damage as humans. But burnout can literally cause brain damage, so it is serious) \n\nI also suggest she gets her hormones (thyroid and sexual, cortizol and vitamin D (which is actually a hormone) ) checked out, coz women's hormones can easily be disbalanced due to stress (cortizol) and that can lead to chronic fatigue and burnout symptoms. If she's been on hormonal BC for more than 2 years, she should also go off it for 6 months, coz prolonged use of hormonal BC also leads to chronic fatigue in women. \nShe should also check her mineral and vitamin levels, coz pushing herself the way she did for so long has probably depleted her reserves and that also exacerbates tiredness and burnout.\n\nHope this helps.", "You wrote you saw how relaxed she was. And she wants to relax a little more. You, considering how important she is to you, had to answer yes or no and face the consequences. In my opinion, adults, including you and your girlfriend, work 9-5 all the time. This world is not fair and some have to work for longer hours for more than 30 years. So, working just for 3 years without vacation doesn't grant the right to rest for months. The money we earn and the people supporting us grant. In your case, it is you. Decide considering things such as, how much you love her, she wouldn't probably want to work at all in the future, your plans for your future, how much you earn, if you want to marry her, what would happen when you are married and have children, etc. So, your response can be considered as an AH move because your response is just about yourself,  not your relationship. You need to talk to her about your future.", "NAH. In this scenario, there is a person who is generally right and a person who is generally wrong, but being wrong doesn\u2019t automatically make a person an asshole. It seems like the way you both are handling this conversation shows a lot of openness, honesty, and maturity. And you should both be commended for that. \n\nOP, your request is completely fair. If you\u2019re going to be taking on the financial burden for both of you, it\u2019s reasonable for you to want some give-and-take. Changing the division of labor around the house in order to offset the earning imbalance makes sense. It would also make sense for you to ask her to come up with a long term plan and discuss it with you, so that her 8 month sabbatical doesn\u2019t turn into a year, then two years, then ten years. You guys seem to communicate well, so figuring out those details together shouldn\u2019t be too difficult a task. \n\nFrom your girlfriend\u2019s perspective, if she\u2019s so burnt out from her working situation that she feels she needs that much time off, I can imagine that it\u2019s all taken a major toll on her mentally. Maybe she\u2019s not thinking totally clearly and the idea of taking on a lot of housework feels intimidating at first, when all of her energy is totally sapped. But it seems like the idea of her break is that it would allow her to reset and deal with the burnt-out feeling. So in theory, once work is behind her, she should start to have more drive and motivation again soon. That energy can go toward taking on more of the chores around the house. And the nice thing about most chores is that they don\u2019t have to be addressed in a rigid way like work tasks do. She can, in a sense, \u201cmake her own schedule\u201d to do things on her time, as long as those chores ultimately get done. \n\nPerhaps there can be an agreement that the 80-20 chore split doesn\u2019t happen right away. If you\u2019re up to it OP, you can offer that her first two weeks away from work are a \u201cvacation.\u201d She keeps her current chores but the rest of her time is totally hers. She can do whatever she needs to start getting her energy back. And then after a couple weeks, when she\u2019s got some proverbial gas in the tank, she starts taking on 80% of the domestic responsibilities. \n\nAt the end of the day, the important thing here is that both of you seem to have communicated your needs in a mature and calm way. This is a big ask on her part, in a time when she\u2019s feeling very mentally drained, and even then it didn\u2019t lead to some massive fight. You say it was just a minor disagreement, which indicates that both of you do a very good job of addressing things together. \n\nSince nobody in this scenario became mean, and everyone communicated their needs maturely, there\u2019s definitely no asshole in this situation. Even though her requests are a bit unrealistic and you\u2019re certainly the person who is in the right.", "Yta to yourself.", "YTA. You just give off bad vibes, it\u2019s completely personal.", "So, your GF needs to take time off work to relax and recover from working her ass off for 9 years, 3 without a vacation and likely few days off, and your response is for her to do most of the housework?  \n\n\nYTA", "You\u2019re not being an asshole but just a bit of a jerk. She\u2019s your gf and your making the whole thing sound transactional.\n\nShe\u2019s doing this to work on herself and she won\u2019t be able to if her time is now dedicated to being your house wife, maybe split the work 60-40 instead. If things get hard you can readdress the situation but don\u2019t just outright burden her with the bulk of the work, tell her that you need to keep this line of communication open as you\u2019re concerned that you will burnout as well.

Putting a percentile on chores is not a great representation of the effort and time they require because taking out the trash is way easier than cleaning the bathroom(just an example). It's great that you are so willing to be there and pull the lions share of the finances. That is not something a lot of partners would be on board for. But she should not be expected to be your housekeeper during this time. In fact, I would be prepared to give her a full month of minimal effort expended on her part, if she feels like she needs 8 months off she could be really struggling. \nNow I am a mother, so I am fully sympathetic to a woman feeling burnout, kids or no kids. So my 2 cents might be a bit skewed. In no way do I think you are TA but I also don't think she is necessarily trying to skirt out on helping around the house. Most of the daily tidying should be coming from her now that she will be the one home the most and the one making the messes during the day. But she should not always be on the hook for ALL the laundry/dishes/trash/cooking/grocery shopping either. I would be violently upset if my partner suggested I should do 80% of the chores because I'm the one not working. If you lived alone you'd be on the hook for 100% of the chores and 100% of the finances 100% of the time. Relationships are never 50/50 all the time. She is asking for some slack, and it will take some adjustments to get to a comfortable place.", "Okay let\u2019s be real if she\u2019s paid off all her debt by age 26, she did not have that much debt. I don\u2019t know anyone my age who had to take out significant student loans and has finished paying them back already and I\u2019m 28.", "She is cleaning her own house and putting a hot meal on her own table. Is she so entitled that she demands a servant?", "It sounds like she wants him to cover her expenses while she tries to find someone else", "Doing half of the chores doesn\u2019t make you a bum", "She could just be completely burnt out. Like just can\u2019t handle daily life anymore and needs a total break. Honestly, I can relate. I think you\u2019re pretty lucky if you can\u2019t relate to what the gf is feeling. I\u2019ve been in situations where I just need to step back and actually focus on doing what I need to do to actually enjoy being alive and get my energy back. Unfortunately, a lot of the time what one \u201cneeds to do\u201d in a situation like this is impossible. There\u2019s a reason why people don\u2019t take breaks like this. It\u2019s not sustainable or realistic and it\u2019s not fair to ask someone to support you like this.", "The main character in the movie Silence of the Lambs murdered people and ate them, but still, in a fictional movie, he totally enjoyed it. (He did spend time learning how to properly cook the dead people though.)", "Eh burnout is a very real thing and she\u2019s stated she\u2019s feeling it. Burnout can take YEARS to recover from and is oftentimes overlooked because it comes with depression and anxiety. \n\nShould she do more of the household chores while not working, sure, and that should be a conversation to have rather than a quip.", "This was my thought.\n\nWhat would be her plan if she were single and didn't have a 2nd earner to support her? I've burned out pretty hard before but I'm single. Taking 8 months off would be impossible. Instead, I took a couple of weeks off and then found different work. And I still did all the chores because I had no choice.\n\nQuite frankly, expecting someone else to take on all the work (in and out of the home) for 8 months is ridiculous and also unsustainable for OP.", "I\u2019d rescind the whole relationship!", "\u201cIf one partner works fewer hours their job is to pick up the slack\u201d\n\nIf I\u2019m dating someone who chooses to work more, I\u2019m not going to sacrifice my time to be a house spouse who supports their career by working from home, because I wouldn\u2019t receive any financial benefit in the case of splitting up. They\u2019ll have received the career support provided by having a house spouse, the house spouse doesn\u2019t get spousal support because they weren\u2019t married. \n\nAnd even if two people are married, working extra hours is often a choice made by one person and not the other partner. Some people choose careers with work-life balance in mind and some choose to work a ton of hours, but the latter shouldn\u2019t expect the former to be their maid, because then the former is giving up the hours they chose their career to have free and then being pushed into a maid role. The latter should bank on either hiring a maid, or doing the housework themselves. One of my considerations for my future career was flexibility and what would allow me to both make a good full time living and alls be a present mother in the future, and take care of my home and have free time, preferably by working from home if needed for some time. I didn\u2019t make these considerations so that I could support my future husband\u2019s career as a maid if he doesn\u2019t choose one with flexibility and family in mind. So yeah, I\u2019d be resentful if I was pushed into working my full time job plus doing 100% of the housework because my future spouse decided to work a hectic lawyer or doctor job that would leave them with no time for their household and family, while expecting that I cover the cracks he doesn\u2019t fill. Similarly, I can see the \u201cI work more hours, so I do less housework\u201d, leading to someone staying at the office of their salaried job late and forcing their spouse into a more domestic role. \n\nIf someone is *expecting* the dating partner to work more and financially support them like OPs gf is, it\u2019s different. A SAHM obviously is gonna do more of the childcare since she is reliant on her husband\u2019s career. OPs girlfriend should since she is reliant on him and has no job by choice. But I think there\u2019s a lot of nuance here.", "No, not a talk. You need to break up.", "When does your lease end?", "They never said it was.", "I was diagnosed with burn out and depression. Not doing chores does not help.\nAlso, OPs gf has the energy for gym, hiking and gaming, so I'm sure she can muster energy to do some chores.", "They used the word for a situation it doesn't apply to. That word means something specific. Watering it down by using it for any situation where someone's in the wrong in a romantic relationship only serves abusers who are using the specific tactic.", "So you can get all the snails you can force down?", "No, that never happened.", "Sorry if she has burnout but that shouldn't mean OP has to support her financially. They're not even married. She can always move back in with mommy and daddy.", "Repeat until you have married an entire cleaning company", "lol alright. took me a second, I'll give you that", "ESH.\n\nFirst, if you both work, then you split chores 50/50, and you don't get to do less because you earn more money.  That's selfish.  No wonder she's burnt out from school, working, housework,, etc.\n\nSecond, she's unrealistic about wanting to take 8 months off for herself and make you the sole support.  You aren't married, and she needs to provide financial support, also.  Suggest at least a part-time job.", "There is no excuse for not wanting to fairly contribute to the household for EIGHT MONTHS", "I didn\u2019t mean in this case you dummy. Is she a moocher? Yes, 100%.\n\nBut when we\u2019re taking about burnout, that isn\u2019t something that makes you soft. It probably doesn\u2019t even apply in this case considering the facts, but it was brought up. Struggling with mental health doesn\u2019t make you TA, making it everyone else\u2019s problem and refusing to get help does though.\n\nSo to clarify\u2014 I agree with you 100%, and from the info we have she is taking full advantage of him. But that\u2019s about where our paths end. Being respectful and educated on mental health doesn\u2019t make me \u201cfragile\u201d. The way you treat it does make you callous, though."]}
