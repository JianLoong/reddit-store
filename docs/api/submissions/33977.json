Lack of empathy or maybe even a fractured marital relationship could explain why she wouldn't go with her husband to her husband's father's funeral. But to pick a fight on that day? Looking for attention or upset that husband's attention is on his dead father (!!!!!)", "Yeah, I can\u2019t think of any job I\u2019ve had that I couldn\u2019t get a day off to attend a family funeral.  Weird.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

That's just heartless and cruel!", "First time I see someone make a funeral about themself. Yikes.", "Agreed, I went to the funeral for my my DH\u2019s Great Uncle, who I\u2019d met once, to be there to support him and his cousin (who was in bits). I subsequently went to his Great Aunt\u2019s funeral, who I\u2019d met maybe three times, to support him and his Nan (it was her sister and she went to pieces). I didn\u2019t really know either of these people, but he asked and I went to offer my support. Both events involved me driving 4hrs plus, and an overnight stay - didn\u2019t matter, he needed me there", "Ikr?! I was invited to my ex mother in laws funeral a few years after my somewhat contentious divorce. My ex and I have a kid together and it would have been shitty if I wasn't there at least for the kid, but these people were my family for decades. The least I could do was show up and be appropriately sad. \n\nWife should have gone regardless.", "Exactly. To me, funerals are less for the person who died than to offer support to the ones who loved them. I've been to funerals of people I've never even met, because I wanted to support a grieving friend.", "This. I went to a funeral for someone I never met to be there for my spouse who had lost someone. Like you don\u2019t have to, different couples can negotiate this differently, but it would never occur to me to *not* go to a family funeral just because I didn\u2019t know them well.\n\nWife is being very weird here. Did she want to go or not?", "Yeah, making everything about oneself in spite of the circumstances is very much a narcissistic trait indeed.", "Dead people do it all the time.", "I don\u2019t consider my in-laws family.  But regardless I\u2019d be there for my husband and future kids.", "Exactly.  I love my husband and I\u2019d support him.", "The only reason I didn\u2019t go to a funeral with my husband recently is because we needed me to work to make rent.  If it wasn\u2019t for that I would have been there.  But have to keep a roof over our heads.  I made sure he was able to go.  And really he was going to support his own family member.  It wasn\u2019t a family member of his but he knew them."]}
