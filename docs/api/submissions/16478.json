We buy these things ourselves to use for ourselves. It's not unheard of to ask someone to use their creamer or whatever, but it's not common; we usually just use our own things. \n\nI brought in a bottle of relatively expensive hot honey (around $3 an ounce) to keep in the cupboard because I eat it on a lot of my lunches. Nancy asked me on two separate occasions to use some of the honey. I said sure, of course. She used a bit too much the first time and I was a little annoyed, because I had let her know before she used it that a little goes a long way. While she was preparing her lunch the second time she used it, I overheard another coworker tell her she was using way too much of it. Nancy said, \"I just really like it like this.\" \n\nLater that day I checked the bottle, and she had used at least three ounces of it (this is an 8oz bottle). I got kind of upset and said, \"What the hell, Nancy?\" She told me she just really liked it (no apology) and I could tell she thought it was kind of funny. I explained that it was an expensive bottle that has to be ordered online, even though I know she already knew that. She then seemed like she felt kind of bad, and she did say sorry. I was still pretty annoyed, because she had been told by two different people to not use so much.\n\nAbout a week later, Nancy showed up at my desk with an enormous jug of honey. Regular honey, not hot honey, and it was from a discount store. Like, extremely cheap. She had a huge smile on her face when she gave it to me, like this fixed the issue. I didn't say anything, I just kind of looked at her. She left the honey on my desk and we went about our work day. When I was leaving for the day, Nancy noticed I had left the jug of honey behind and called after me to tell me. I said, a bit snarky, \"I don't want an enormous jug of regular honey, Nancy, I have no use for it.\" She got a hurt look on her face and I immediately felt guilty, but I left and didn't say anything else. A lot of our coworkers heard me, and one of them texted me to say that I had upset Nancy. \n\nI know Nancy meant well, but she's an adult who is capable of understanding that she was taking advantage of my willingness to share. And she showed a weird sense of entitlement by using the amount of my stuff that she did after being told twice not to. \n\nSo AITA for making her feel bad for trying to replace a specialty item with a large amount of a very cheap one?", "created_utc": 1683316470, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138zg1q/aita_for_telling_a_coworker_i_didnt_have_any_use/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if you\u2019re taking anything that specialty to work, you should keep it in your own drawer and not among the semi-common resources", "NTA\n\nRegular honey doesn't replace hot honey (I honestly have no idea what that is). If she wanted to make it up to you, she should have gotten you hot honey. A big jar of discount honey means nothing.", "Wow this is borderline...I'm gonna say NTA but should have been handled differently. Put the Regular Honey in the cupboard with a note that offers it for general use. Tell Nancy *privately* that now there is plenty of honey she is not to use your 'hot honey' any longer.", "NTA. It's not hard to Google the name of the stuff she wasted and used up and order more of that for you and herself.", "NTA. You can't use up a specialty item then try to replace it with a different, cheaper item that isn't even the same and expect you to be okay with it. Nancy is a tool.", "I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say OP is, in any way, the asshole in this situation, but I do question a few decisions they made:\n\n1) I do not understand why OP took the expensive stuff to work. Why not go ahead and make your meal the night before, with the hot honey, and then just bring it in?\n\n2) I do not get why OP did not offer up a link to this co-worker, for the specialty honey, so that she could buy her own instead of using his.\n\n3) Spending $24 on hot honey. I did a quick google search and found so many other hot honeys that had 10-12 ounces for anywhere between $9 and $17. I get that people want what they want, but it\u2019s not like this is such a specialty product where there aren\u2019t competing brands.\n\nThat being said what the coworker did wasn\u2019t okay. Even if the honey was super cheap, you don\u2019t just go and consume (almost) half a bottle (3 out of 8 ounces) in one fell swoop, especially after you\u2019ve been asked to only take a little. \n\nShe also should have asked what you wanted, if you wanted her to replace something or compensate you in any way. I\u2019m really curious if she even asked OP, after the second time of eating the honey, what the actual cost of the honey was. \nI\u2019m sure her thought was \u2018It cannot possibly cost more than this giant jug of regular honey!\u2019 It shouldn\u2019t matter if it did though. It\u2019s not the thought that counts this time. If she used hot honey, she should\u2019ve got the hot honey, or even tried to get \u201ca\u201d hot honey, or at least paid the cost to replace the portion she used, so $9.\n\nNTA.", "You should have moved her jug of honey to the office cupboard if you wanted to send a silent message to Nancy  And taken back your honey, keeping it at your desk.\n\nI know honesty is what you were after but this is a workplace and better to just smile and keep the peace in the work place.  Money is at stake and Id want a paycheck before I made a big deal over 8 oz of honey.  \n\nYou learned a lesson on who you can share with and who you cant.  NTA", "NTA Nancy was being snarky buying that big pot o bullshit honey, then when you reacted appropriately she is now crying victim. Let her drown in her tears and pour some honey on her wounds.", "NTA. This sort of office behavior makes me nuts. It's OK to ask for a taste or to try something once, but after that you go online and find out where to buy your own. I would've put a Post-it on the cheap honey with Nancy's name on it and stored it in the cupboard, then put the good stuff in my drawer. Annoying to have to be reduced to this, but hopefully she won't do it again.", "NTA. There's no chance she thought the two were interchangeable. Especially after you told her *repeatedly* that the hot honey was an expensive specialty item that had to be ordered online. \n\nShe bought the jug of honey solely for *herself* to assuage her guilt and look like a good person. The jug was giant for effect - an effect that only benefits her. If she'd bought the \"gift\" with *you* in mind, it would have been the same bottle of hot honey she'd been using.", "**NTA-** if you use or overuse someone else's stuff in excess of what they thought they were lending you, then common courtesy is to *replace like with like*. Replacing it with an inferior product and pretending like that makes it okay is disingenuous. \n\nIf she has creamer she likes, then borrow excessive amounts of that and replace it with the most disgusting cheapo powdered creamer you can get your hands on.", "\u201cI have a coworker who is extremely nice and always means well\u201d \n\nusing way too much of your honey and not saying sorry doesn\u2019t sound very nice lolol", "I'd say a gentle YTA, because you work with this person. For the sake of inner office harmony, it would've been easy enough to just take the honey and say \"Thank you,\" then dispose of it how you wanted. Or leave it in the cupboard at work, perhaps w/a note saying \"Please use if you want it.\"", "Im gonna say TA for the way you responded to your coworker attempting to correct her actions. Also if you tell someone they can use a condiment you own without specifying they only use a small amount, then you can't really have issue with the amount they use. Also you allowed this person to use it a second time, knowing that they were generous with the amount the first time.

For certain, Nancy is definitely an AH because she used $9 worth of gourmet honey in one go and cheekily thought handing you what I assume is a big plastic bear of institutional honey would somehow be an acceptable make up for that. As in didn't even seek out another type of hot honey, flavored honey, or even decent regular honey. On face value, that is exceptionally lame.\n\nOTOH, you state Nancy is \"extremely nice and always means well\"...she may be a total dolt who is unaware that $72 bottles of honey exist, and perhaps her gesture was done with the best of intentions. It may have been better to take a gentler approach and explain that you splurge on this luxury honey and it's not the same as using someone else's Heinz ketchup: this can't be replaced with 'just any honey' as it is very expensive and needs to be specially ordered, etc. Offer her the website you buy from so she can purchase her own hot honey stash. And start keeping yours at your desk.", "I think you should\u2019ve kept the honey and offered it to anyone who asked to use some of your hot honey", "I\u2019m going with ESH here. Nancy is the bigger problem, but I think keeping an expensive specialty item in a communal area is asking for trouble (especially after the first incident).\n\nI also think your comment would have been better received privately instead of making it the business of everyone at work. I don\u2019t think you were wrong for saying it given the full context, but it sounds like Nancy is generally well liked and does generally mean well, so the method kind of just escalated drama/hostility in an unproductive way.", "I came here to say this! ^", "I think it\u2019s honey infused with chilies.", "Even though Nancy is clearly in the wrong, I think you've got the right take here. The OP's response escalated the issue in a way that prompted others to intervene, to soothe hurt feelings and problem-solve. He made his problem everyone's problem.\n\nI'll go with ESH though, because I do think Nancy is clearly in the wrong.", "Same here.   NTA - But special things should be kept separately for this reason with people see them mixed in with the common items they kind of don't compute that it's an expensive and hard to replace item."]}
