We buy these things ourselves to use for ourselves. It's not unheard of to ask someone to use their creamer or whatever, but it's not common; we usually just use our own things. \n\nI brought in a bottle of relatively expensive hot honey (around $3 an ounce) to keep in the cupboard because I eat it on a lot of my lunches. Nancy asked me on two separate occasions to use some of the honey. I said sure, of course. She used a bit too much the first time and I was a little annoyed, because I had let her know before she used it that a little goes a long way. While she was preparing her lunch the second time she used it, I overheard another coworker tell her she was using way too much of it. Nancy said, \"I just really like it like this.\" \n\nLater that day I checked the bottle, and she had used at least three ounces of it (this is an 8oz bottle). I got kind of upset and said, \"What the hell, Nancy?\" She told me she just really liked it (no apology) and I could tell she thought it was kind of funny. I explained that it was an expensive bottle that has to be ordered online, even though I know she already knew that. She then seemed like she felt kind of bad, and she did say sorry. I was still pretty annoyed, because she had been told by two different people to not use so much.\n\nAbout a week later, Nancy showed up at my desk with an enormous jug of honey. Regular honey, not hot honey, and it was from a discount store. Like, extremely cheap. She had a huge smile on her face when she gave it to me, like this fixed the issue. I didn't say anything, I just kind of looked at her. She left the honey on my desk and we went about our work day. When I was leaving for the day, Nancy noticed I had left the jug of honey behind and called after me to tell me. I said, a bit snarky, \"I don't want an enormous jug of regular honey, Nancy, I have no use for it.\" She got a hurt look on her face and I immediately felt guilty, but I left and didn't say anything else. A lot of our coworkers heard me, and one of them texted me to say that I had upset Nancy. \n\nI know Nancy meant well, but she's an adult who is capable of understanding that she was taking advantage of my willingness to share. And she showed a weird sense of entitlement by using the amount of my stuff that she did after being told twice not to. \n\nSo AITA for making her feel bad for trying to replace a specialty item with a large amount of a very cheap one?\n\nETA: I forgot I wasn\u2019t on my main and that it isn\u2019t obvious, but I\u2019m a lady, not that it really matters.

Why not go ahead and make your meal the night before, with the hot honey, and then just bring it in?\n\n2) I do not get why OP did not offer up a link to this co-worker, for the specialty honey, so that she could buy her own instead of using his.\n\n3) Spending $24 on hot honey. I did a quick google search and found so many other hot honeys that had 10-12 ounces for anywhere between $9 and $17.

I\u2019m really curious if she even asked OP, after the second time of eating the honey, what the actual cost of the honey was. \nI\u2019m sure her thought was \u2018It cannot possibly cost more than this giant jug of regular honey!\u2019 It shouldn\u2019t matter if it did though. It\u2019s not the thought that counts this time.

As in didn't even seek out another type of hot honey, flavored honey, or even decent regular honey. On face value, that is exceptionally lame.\n\nOTOH, you state Nancy is \"extremely nice and always means well\"...she may be a total dolt who is unaware that $72 bottles of honey exist, and perhaps her gesture was done with the best of intentions. It may have been better to take a gentler approach and explain that you splurge on this luxury honey and it's not the same as using someone else's Heinz ketchup: this can't be replaced with 'just any honey' as it is very expensive and needs to be specially ordered, etc. Offer her the website you buy from so she can purchase her own hot honey stash.

Don\u2019t keep an item in the communal cupboard if you don\u2019t want people to use it.

There\u2019s a reason why you left it on the desk. She wanted to be patted on the back , but she didn\u2019t really deserve a pat on the back.\n\nI can say, is greedy, greedy, greedy", "ESH\n\nNancy obviously sucks for taking advantage and trying to make up for it by buying you a big jar of cheap (and likely fake) honey. But telling her you \"have no use for it\" was not nice. You allowed her to use your honey - including a second time after she used too much the first time. You don't really get to complain about it. Chalk it up to a learning experience and put the big jar of honey in the cupboard and next time Nancy asks if she can use some just say \"go right ahead.\" Put your special honey inside an inconspicuous and opaque jar marked something nobody would ever want to look at but clearly marked with your name like \"Sharon's Mayonnaise Packets\" and move on with your life.", "NTA. She bought your performative honey which makes her the asshole but you shouldn\u2019t be keeping speciality food items that you care about in the communal kitchen.", "NTA but seriously. Why didn't you say no after she overdid it the first time? And some of you all are way too trusting with communal cabinets.", "NTA. She took advantage and if she was sincere about the replacement she would have gone online and replaced it with the same level of honey. That cheap honey is cut with sugar and isn\u2019t even real honey.", "Nancy is an adult who knew the hot honey was special and expensive and replaced with a cheap regular honey. Unless she has special needs she should have known better", "came here to say that too, NTA\n\nalso came here to say i dont get why people think once they have permission to use something they can do whatever they want with it? like i had a (ex)friend that once asked to use my canteen card to buy lunch and i said ok and they kept asking for it everyday and i felt bad so i said yes and anyway they ended up spending over 250$ of my parents money at the canteen in one year and would act upset and hurt if i said no to make me feel guilty. thank god im not friends w them anymore tho.", "[deleted]", "I like lemon infused myself.", "She had permission, so its not theft. She got greedy and used more than courtesy would warrant.", "Exactly.  Expensive or not, using 3 oz out of an 8 oz jar of something seems excessive. And she was told it was expensive and that she was using too much.  NTA.  OP is putting her condiments with other folk\u2019s\u2019 condiments where the rule is stuff is not \u201cfree range\u201d.  Coworker is TA. She knew honey wasn\u2019t a replacement.", "Communal storage of items isn't the same as the items themselves being communal. If someone puts their lunch in the communal fridge at work then that's obviously not meant to be eaten by anyone else...", "A communal cupboard doesn't mean all the food is communal. Nancy knew enough to ask didn't she? She knew it wasn't hers. I dislike infantilizing adults down to the lowest common denominator. Just put the big jug in the cupboard and Nancy can use that.", "Exactly"]}
