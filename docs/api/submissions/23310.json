You lost a out on a significant amount of money and your mom is just blowing it off? You've got a mom and a brother problem. He needs to understand his behavior is inappropriate and it needs to be corrected and that is mom's responsibility. \n\nUnless she decides to accept her role as a parent, I would definitely put down clear boundaries with lil bro and not treat him to anything out of pocket. He's lost that privilege.", "NTA, he was wrong to do that and you are handling it fairly. Prank, joke or not does not make it easier on the person being pranked.", "NTA- sounds like a fair punishment to me.  \n\nYou can tell him lying to you caused more harm than the loss of money.\n\nBecause it causes you to distrust things he says.  You want to be able to believe him.  He's your brother and you love him.\n\nAnd you're not taking him to fun places this summer to teach him that lesson.  So you're not doing it because you love him but also to teach him that what he did was wrong.", "Your mom is a problem. She can pay for her son's activities and reimburse you for the money you lost.

Yes, your brother is of an age to do cruel stupid things without thinking it through.  That's when parents step in and discuss consequences and empathy and why pranks are usually code for bullying.  Instead she's excusing him and going after you?  No.", "NTA.  He didn't apologize to you, did he? I get he's a kid, but if he's really sorry, he should apologize.  Until then, he doesn't get to eat on your dime.", "NTA. Yourother should make other arrangements for him rather than expecting you to be in charge of him all summer.\n\nHis behavior is not okay.

You are being much nicer than most would be.   Just losing bi weekly dinners is a small punishment.  I would create a job list of home tasks that are required each week as well as time spent doing required reading or other non screen tome.  You are doing quite a big favor for mom and brother and neither one seem to appreciate it.", "NTA. A joke is to message you asking about the books with the user name Mike Hunt.

Your brother is old enough to learn that his actions have consequences.

Part of it also comes from the fact that I\u2019m the older sibling and should set an example for him (which includes being the bigger person in conflicts). Don\u2019t get me wrong she\u2019s still a great mother :)", "True. And thanks to OP not being a doormat, next time he\u2019ll think it through.", "You're setting a good example by teaching him consequences. By the way, your mom should be setting the example. She's older than both of you. Being a bigger person does not go hand in hand with letting people get away with mistreating you or to cover up their wrong doings.", "Being the bigger person is telling to set you up as doormat. It means you're easier for her to control so she'll try that so she doesn't have to control him.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like a great parent if your brother allowed to just say he is sorry! And this wasn\u2019t a prank", "Uhm, no she's not. She clearly favors your brother to the point that she won't even criticize or punish him for a really rotten prank. I'm sorry you've been brainwashed into thinking your brother is your responsibility. You are NTA but your mother sure is."]}
