After about a year she calls me into the bathroom one day. Shes standing in front of the mirror in a formfitting stretchy dress and looks at her stomach. She asks me if I think the dress still fit her. I could see her stomach was bigger, but I look like that in the evening sometimes too, so I just assumed she was bloated. I brush it off and say she looks fine, we should normalize being bloated at the end if the day. She gives me kinda a weird look before she say shes not bloated, shes 3months pregnant. Yup thats how she decided to tell me. Anyway, I\u2019m kinda taken aback as it came out if the blue.

Not with alot of enthusiasm per say, as I dont really get excited about the idea of pregnancy and babies and this really was a surprise, but I was polite enough. After followed an awkward silence before I made up an excuse to have to go study. \n\nA few weeks go by and we kinda just go back to normal. While making dinner one evening I ask her if shes found a new place to stay. Shes really confused and ask what I mean. I remind her of the contract she signed, that say no babies can live here. I tell her that she can of course stay up until the baby comes, but it would probably be wise to look for a new place soon. I dont know if she assumed she would he able to continue to stay here with the baby, but I guess so?? \n\nA few days later I started getting texts from her friends calling me an asshole for kicking out a pregnant women on the street.

What OP is doing is illegal. However NTA imo because living with a child against one's will is tough. I can't imagine having my sleep screwed up for a decision i didnt make.  Maybe just don't renew the lease and give standard 60 days notice.", "I think there are laws in place as well, but I guess it depends on several factors (first being the country). In Italy is almost impossible to evict someone who's pregnant, even in cases when the rent has not being paid in months. It changes for shared leases though, that state an exact number of people living in the house.\n\nThat said, I don't think she's the AH.

The roommate is still a tenant and still has rights.", "It does not matter if it's in the lease. There are laws against it, just as there are laws against discriminating against a certain race.   \nIt is a law where I am that you are not even allowed to discriminate against pet owners unless you can prove with an allergy test done by a doctor that you have allergies. Even if you put it in the lease, it is void because it is against the law. Condos and retirement centers are the only places these laws do not apply to.   \nIf you have no concept of the law/tenant rights, then you probably should not be putting your 2 cents in.", "My understanding is that they are. Also, is it not a loophole that having a baby is an entire additional human that was not on the lease initially ?", "It varies a lot from place to place, it's probably a coin flip on whether or not this is enforcable.

I hope it all works out well for everyone involved", "True, and I think it matters if they live onsite in a non commercial building (4 units or less).\n\nThey would NOT be allowed to discriminate on most things, but limiting the number of occupants would be allowed.  I think in a situation where they share a dwelling with their tenant, they can discriminate based on gender as well.\n\nIn a commercial situation, some laws stipulate maximum occupancy based on square footage or number of bedrooms (usually they say 2 heartbeats per bedroom plus 1 extra), but in those cases the baby isn't included in that count til they are 6 months old.  But, this isn't commercial.", "So does the person who owns her home. You are also aware that in dorm rooms pregnant women can only live their until the baby is born and then they have to leave right?

There are laws allowing people to discriminate against a tenant that's already living on the property? lmfao you have no idea what you're talking about. That shit would not hold up in court unless the judge is a bigot as well.", "In most places that stuff doesn\u2019t apply if the landlord also lives in the property.", "You do know that US laws do not apply worldwide, right?", "You do know I'm not from the US, right?", "NTA.  You were very clear in 'no babies/children' as roommates.  You aren't kicking out a pregnant woman, you are giving her 5 months to find somewhere else to live.  I am 100% in agreement with you.  I have no desire to live with a baby.\n\nReply to each text \"I'll let <roommate> know that you are offering her a place to stay, thanks!\"", "NTA her pregnancy isn't your problem. Block everyone", "NTA.\n\nFirst point.  You are not making a pregnant woman homeless, as her friends suggest.  Rather, you are giving a pregnant woman several months notice that she needs to find a new living arrangement.  If she fails to use that opportunity, it is her issue, not yours.  And, parenthetically, I note that she would have had **more** notice if she had disclosed her pregnancy to you in the first trimester.  \n\nSecond point.  A pregnant woman is entitled to a certain amount of deference.  Not going to argue there.  But that generally pertains good parking spaces, the nice seat on the subway, assistance when handling heavy objects, and a ride to the hospital if she unexpectedly goes into labor.  That deference does not demand that you give up your own rights.  \n\nThird point.  If you were her landlord living across town or something, I'd be giving you some serious side-eye, condemning you, and noting that you're possibly breaking discrimination laws.  But since you're also living in the place, a whole other set of rights come into play.  You are her **landlord and roommate**.  If you were merely her roommate, I believe you would be entirely within your rights, ethically speaking, to negotiate either your exit from the rental or hers.  But given that you own the place and landlord -- only her exit is a viable solution.  \n\nFourth point.  As you note, she knew damn well when she signed her rental agreement that the pregnancy would require her to move.  That's why she didn't tell you until she could no longer conceal it.  That kind of thing is bad faith on her part.  Not to mention (as I said above) that she could have had more notice from you if she had been truthful.  \n\nFifth point.  She also knows damn well that she's in the wrong.  That's why she's getting her friends to bombard you with appeals to emotion and social status.  If she had a leg to stand on, ethically speaking, she would appeal to an ethical theory.  Not to mention that if you yield to her friends' social pressure, then you're on the hook to be a doormat for the foreseeable future, as they harangue you for making a woman with a newborn, woman with a toddler, woman with a young child, woman with a tween, woman with a teenager, and woman with a twenty-something slacker son homeless.  It's a good idea to cut that noise off here.  Oh ... and if her friends are concerned about her being homeless and pregnant, one of them could put her up or they could take a collection to get her an apartment.  \n\nSixth point.  You've taken the polite, human approach by telling her she needs to find a new place.  Since she's not amenable to that, it's time to take the business approach.  First step is to offer some kind of settlement.  Maybe offer her a month of free rent if she agrees to vacate by the end of December.  Yeah, that's a bribe and it sucks.  But it's cheaper than the alternative, both in terms of dollars and psychic costs.  If she's not willing to play ball, then you drop the hammer.  Is she a month-to-month tenant?  Then forget the pregnancy clause and give her the minimum notice to move out.  if she doesn't take it seriously, then haul her into court and start the formal eviction process.  In doing so, pile on every conceivable theory you can for not just requiring her to move, but also extracting money from her on the way out.  And make it clear that the suit goes away if she signs a settlement agreement, packs her bags, and leaves.  \n\nSeventh point.  Consider this an early, painful lesson.

Even without that clause it\u2019s still a lot to ask from a roommate- babies are incredibly demanding and a huge responsibility for everyone in the household (they are loud but require you to be very quiet, they require a lot of things that are bulky like feeding chairs and baby bathtubs and toys and strollers and car seats, you have to make sure you have zero contacts with sick people so your social life is affected,having any guests is hard and that\u2019s just if you\u2019re living in the same house with them). I can\u2019t see how she assumed it would be ok to have a newborn while living with roommates. Your contract is only making a legal obligation out of something that should have been a moral one, so good thinking on having it.", "NTA\n\nI bet her friends don't know the whole story! She signed a contract and it wasn't in \"fine print\", was it? The pregnancy bit?! So I bet she was hoping to push this boundary, and from then on just keep on pushing! Next thing you know you're on babysitting duty, even.\n\nKeep to your contract\n\nEdit: the friends calling TA can take her in, no?", "NTA - and \u201ckicked out on the street\u201d lol. She has five months to find a new apartment", "NTA she chose to be pregnant and she chose to sign a contract knowing the rules. Babies are disruptive with feedings, crying etc. It is your home and you have a right to decide the rules. You are not kicking her out to the street, she has had 9 months to find living arrangements she is breaking the contract. If she cannot plan for a new home or baby sitting etc then she should not have gotten pregnant. Was she also expecting you to babysit or help rear her child? Where is the father of the child? If her friends feel so strongly, let them take her in and help. Unless you have a month to month contract I would begin legal eviction now before the baby comes.", "Well she seems to have a certain level of trust with you. Maybe she\u2019s just scared to move in with new people. No one wants a random pregnant woman moving in with them. And I get that it\u2019s not your responsibility, I understand that you don\u2019t need to stay up for someone else\u2019s kid. BUT it\u2019s definitely going to be a bit of a struggle for her. Hopefully she\u2019s able to find a place with a person she can trust.", "NTA", "Legally, NTA. Morally...still NTA. She knew. She should have told you sooner.", "Absolutely NTA. Babies are loud and annoying. Plus it sounds like a 2 bedroom flat so eventually she\u2019ll need another room anyway. Plus was she even intending to pay extra as she\u2019d be using more utilities etc.\n\nmake sure you give her the required notice in writing so she cane claim she wasn\u2019t officially told.", "NTA", "NTA - this is LITERALLY \"fucked around and found out\". She didn't tell you when she found out she was pregnant and talked to you about it then. She waited until she was starting to show, and tried to casually bring up the fact she's 3 months pregnant, as if doing it this way would somehow make you change your mind about the no babies rule. Hell, kids I could maybe deal with, but a new baby? Definitely not. Nobody wants to deal with that, not even the parents \ud83d\ude02.\n\nShe knew the deal, and she didn't forget or anything, because this was her plan for how to try and get you to let her stay. She could've told you as soon as she found out... She didn't. She waited long enough she could try to manipulate you into letting her stay by playing the \"but I'm pregnant!\" Card. \n\nNTA and tbh she's kind of an asshole for trying to pull this, as if a newborn baby is like a hamster, or something that wouldn't massively disrupt your lives for months!\n\nGood on you for not letting someone else step all over your (perfectly reasonable) boundaries.", "Since OP lives there, she has a lot more flexibility on why she is removing someone. As long as she gives notice, some places don\u2019t even require that.", "Wow. I have never heard of a Bratty Maine Coon. Ours is the sweetest old man, now, that we have ever had. I thought they were all mild tempered.", "Protect yourself and serve her written notice. Her friends seem pretty judgy yet have no conviction to help her out either. Where is the father of the child? As a woman who values my right to make choices especially about children, there are consequences to those choices. She got pregnant, she is choosing to have the child and it is her responsibility to provide for that child regardless of her support structure or schooling. She is a tenant not your girlfriend.", "Puh this is a tough one. As someone who definetly wants to have kids it's hard for me to understand how you do not want to life with children, but I know how stressful a newborn and even a toddler is, if you don't want kids and it's not even your own they are just annoying I guess. Probably similar to a neighbor that's constantly playing bad music very loud. \n\nIn the end, you didn't evict her, you told her that she needs to find a new place for when the baby is there. Something that's probably necessary anyway. I don't know how the housing situation is where you live. In Berlin and some other places in Germany and Europe being in need to find something during the whole 9 months pregnancy would have been pretty close to being evicted, because it's that hard to find affordable rooms/apartments.\nShe knew the rules, she probably counted on you bending them for her a little bit because she was a pretty good roommate but that's not your fault. NAH", "NTA. I don\u2019t like the idea some people have, that pregnant women deserve special treatment from just everyone. From the father of the baby, ok. But something I always found annoying, is how parents or soon to be parents are sometimes becoming entitled because they\u2019re about to do what happens everywhere in nature all the time. These were your rules, she has enough time to find another place, she is not entitled to exceptions.", "NTA. You have the right to decide how you want to live.\n\nI'm seven months pregnant, and when my bf and I found out, we told our roommate before anyone else because we knew that he was confirmed child-free and has a number of mental health reasons why it would be a bad idea to share a home with an infant (sound  triggers, nothing dangerous). He took it well, organized his next living situation, and he's moving out as soon as my water breaks. We'll move into a place shortly after once the lease is officially up. There's no hard feelings anywhere. We know he's happy for us, he just doesn't want to live with a baby, like you. Your roommate should be just as understanding.", "Roommate gets her barrage of friends to harass you and thinks that is a good environment to raise her child?\nNTA. You had an agreement. She broke it.", "NTA. Living with a newborn is a huge lifestyle change and has a massive affect on sleep, schedule and smells.", "Nta and whats to say she would have forced simeone down the line to leave", "A VERY clear NTA", "Technically NTA , but your approach sounds like it was harsh. \n\nThe whole situation is assholey, not just yours but in general! We have a massive housing crisis in Ireland and it's the greed of landlords that cause this. We're a small population with thousands of children homeless. I get your situation I really truly do, but maybe instead of \"reminding her of your contract that babies can't live here\" sitting down and talking with her about the unsuitability of your space for a child and the fact that this is not child friendly accommodation, that she will need to find a new place to live in the coming months for her sake, the child's sake and your sake. A bit of sensitivity. \n\nI don't know, I feel for her in this situation. Couldn't imagine how stressful it must be for her, and I understand your situation but your just in a better position than her... Doesn't mean it's your problem to take on board or anything, bhut jeez it just sucks", "Well u write better than like 95%of Americans if this is not ur first language \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA\u2026..ur house, UR RULES \ud83d\udc4d", "This might vary wildly in the jurisdiction you're in, but legally the OP could be in the wrong.\n\nTo the OP, YTA.", "Ba dum tsss!!! \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udca5\ud83e\udd41", "OP make sure you put it in writing and kick her out asap to make this as smooth a process as possible, legally. \n\nNTA", "Boooo", "Then why on making that decision did she not sit down with OP and say\n\n\"Sorry to tell you this but I am pregnant.  I plan on giving the baby up for adoption. I am going to meet with the company/people and sign the contract on this date.\"   (however she can back out of this after giving birth and then come home with the baby)\n\nInstead she drops a bombshell on her.", "Yes.
