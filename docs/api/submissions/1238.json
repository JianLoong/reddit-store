We share kitchen, livingroom and bathroom, and have seperate bedrooms. When my current roommate (F26) signed the contract, I went over it with her. Mostly standard stuff, but one section is added that no cats or babies/children are allowed. Cats because I am extremely allergic and children because i dont want to live with a child (children visiting is ofc fine. We have an agreement that any long term visitors will need to be cleared with the other person). Breaking those rules will lead to eviction. \n\nWe get along great, we are quite similar in our habits, she always pay her rent on time, and there are no food stealing. After about a year she calls me into the bathroom one day. Shes standing in front of the mirror in a formfitting stretchy dress and looks at her stomach. She asks me if I think the dress still fit her. I could see her stomach was bigger, but I look like that in the evening sometimes too, so I just assumed she was bloated. I brush it off and say she looks fine, we should normalize being bloated at the end if the day. She gives me kinda a weird look before she say shes not bloated, shes 3months pregnant. Yup thats how she decided to tell me. Anyway, I\u2019m kinda taken aback as it came out if the blue. Shes never mentioned it before, never mentioned wanting a kid, or a boyfriend (found out the pregnancy was from a ons). \n\nAfter probably looking like an idiot for a few seconds I calmly congratulate her. Not with alot of enthusiasm per say, as I dont really get excited about the idea of pregnancy and babies and this really was a surprise, but I was polite enough. After followed an awkward silence before I made up an excuse to have to go study. \n\nA few weeks go by and we kinda just go back to normal. While making dinner one evening I ask her if shes found a new place to stay. Shes really confused and ask what I mean. I remind her of the contract she signed, that say no babies can live here. I tell her that she can of course stay up until the baby comes, but it would probably be wise to look for a new place soon. I dont know if she assumed she would he able to continue to stay here with the baby, but I guess so?? \n\nA few days later I started getting texts from her friends calling me an asshole for kicking out a pregnant women on the street. She has like 5months to find a new place, and I charge a pretty average rent for the room, so its not like she cant afford other places with roommates. \n\nI completely understand why I might seem like the asshole to some, but I genuinely think Im in the right here.

It know it seems heartless on the surface, but you put those clauses in the contract for a good reason.  \n\nIt is really lousy that your roommate is telling her friends about this.

You aren't 'kicking her out on the streets'.  She'll have to find another place.  Babies come with a lot of noise, clutter, and parental expectations of help.\n\nIf laws allow where you are (may be different since you live there too) or she is on a month-to-month, give her formal written notice, and I\"d shorten that timeline down to no more than 3 months.

You're not immediately removing her either, you said she can stay while she finds a place, she has 5 months to do so. I know English isn't your first language, so probably not in the US but if we have stipulations like that, I can imagine other countries do too. You're not renting a flat to her, you're letting her stay in a room in your house.

Idk about where you\u2019re from, where I live (UT, USA) if it\u2019s in the lease, and you sign it, you are on the hook and required to meet the terms of the contract. Any terms not met or breach is reason for eviction. Even if the terms of the lease are illegal (I got stuck paying out the a$$ bc the terms of my last lease were illegal and I\u2019m still paying down the debt of leaving that lease for that reason).

What OP is doing is illegal. However NTA imo because living with a child against one's will is tough. I can't imagine having my sleep screwed up for a decision i didnt make.  Maybe just don't renew the lease and give standard 60 days notice.", "I think there are laws in place as well, but I guess it depends on several factors (first being the country). In Italy is almost impossible to evict someone who's pregnant, even in cases when the rent has not being paid in months. It changes for shared leases though, that state an exact number of people living in the house.\n\nThat said, I don't think she's the AH.

Also, there are plenty of housing/apartments that are for older people w/o children.

The roommate is still a tenant and still has rights.", "It does not matter if it's in the lease. There are laws against it, just as there are laws against discriminating against a certain race.   \nIt is a law where I am that you are not even allowed to discriminate against pet owners unless you can prove with an allergy test done by a doctor that you have allergies. Even if you put it in the lease, it is void because it is against the law. Condos and retirement centers are the only places these laws do not apply to.   \nIf you have no concept of the law/tenant rights, then you probably should not be putting your 2 cents in.", "My understanding is that they are. Also, is it not a loophole that having a baby is an entire additional human that was not on the lease initially ?", "It varies a lot from place to place, it's probably a coin flip on whether or not this is enforcable. OP really needs to check in with a tenancy lawyer or give the landlord and tenant board a call for clarification.

I hope it all works out well for everyone involved", "True, and I think it matters if they live onsite in a non commercial building (4 units or less).\n\nThey would NOT be allowed to discriminate on most things, but limiting the number of occupants would be allowed.  I think in a situation where they share a dwelling with their tenant, they can discriminate based on gender as well.\n\nIn a commercial situation, some laws stipulate maximum occupancy based on square footage or number of bedrooms (usually they say 2 heartbeats per bedroom plus 1 extra), but in those cases the baby isn't included in that count til they are 6 months old.  But, this isn't commercial.", "So does the person who owns her home. You are also aware that in dorm rooms pregnant women can only live their until the baby is born and then they have to leave right?

She has to apply to terminate it through the tenant board in her area, and it will never stand because you cannot discriminate.  \nIf OP does kick her, I hope the girl takes her to court!
