There are a lot of things I encounter throughout the day that trigger me and it\u2019s tough sometimes, but I understand it\u2019s my responsibility to work on my issues, not everyone else\u2019s to coddle my specific triggers. The point of recovery is to get to a place where you\u2019re not bothered by any mention of food or weight, two topics that are IMPOSSIBLE to avoid in the real world \u2013 trying to avoid them is the opposite of what she should be doing.

Hopefully Rosa matures a little, because this kind of behavior is very unhealthy - it's not like you had something purposely and clearly offensive on your pen (like, say, a slur).
