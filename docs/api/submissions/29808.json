You literally did nothing wrong: \n\n\u201cHey can you pick me up?\u201d\n\n \u201cSure!\u201d \n\nHow the hell were you supposed to know she cancelled plans for you based on that conversation lol. Your sister in law should be mad at your mother in law if anything.", "NTA. Sounds like SIL has some serious main character syndrome. I would also hazard a guess that SIL was the one who wanted to go to this in the first place while MIL didn't care too much.\n\nIt's not manipulative to *ask* for something, as long as you're able to accept when the answer is no", "NTA.  Your MIL made the choice to go pick you up.  Your SIL is just creating drama.  Psychiatric hospitals, like all other hospitals, generally don\u2019t take you inpatient unless you need it.  They\u2019ve got a limited number of beds, so they try to make best use of them.", "NTA - but why didn\u2019t your husband make your discharge a priority?", "Are you known for precognition? No? Then how the heck were you supposed to know your MIL canceled plans in order to help you? \n\nFor that matter, your MIL is an adult, correct? She makes her own decisions and whatnot? How exactly did you have any control over her choice to cancel plans? \n\nPerhaps your SIL thinks you\u2019re a supernatural creature of some sort. A precognitive puppet master, honing your skills as a new urban legend while secreted away in a psychiatric hospital. Or something to that effect. \n\nYour MIL was probably looking for a way out of the plans she had with SIL since she (SIL) sounds awful. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You asked, MIL said yes. No problem. You had no idea about the (tentative, unconfirmed) plans. Therefore you bear no responsibility for disrupting them. If SIL should have been angry at anyone, it should have been MIL for cancelling on her, not you. However, if SIL is often like this, I can understand why MIL would rather spend time with you.", ">my SIL was extremely upset about this and said I was faking it for attention and that my husband should have just taken off work to pick me up.\n\nNTA. \n\nDid your SIL think you faked it and got admitted to the hospital just to get attention? \n\nSome people are weird.", "NTA. Follow up with your MIL and thank her graciously again for changing her plans to help you in a time of need. She clearly cares about you. Maybe you\u2019ll further endear yourself to her with the possible added bonus of making SIL even more jealous.", "NTA. I\u2019m assuming you and your MIL have a good relationship. If so, she probably felt like picking you up after a week in the hospital was more important to her that whatever their plans were.", "NTA. MIL thought the one time pick you up from the hospital after having been there a week was more important than the tentative \u201chey, it would be cool to go to XYZ next week\u201d plans with SIL. Hospital *should* trump plans that could be done anytime.", "NTA, she could have said no", "NTA.. Your MIL is a grown woman and, I'm sure, is capable of speaking for herself. If she didn't want to pick you up, she would've said no. \n\nSIL is, probably, just bent outta shape cause MIL chose to help you over going with her. Don't let her immaturity get to you. Thankfully to your MIL, your health and your husband's job don't take a backseat to SIL's entertainment schedule.", "NTA\u2014-what exactly does she think you were faking? Sounds like she has a problem with you getting help for whatever was going on and that\u2019s on her.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong.  You asked her to help you and she agreed.\n\nThey can take their trip next week.\n\nIMO, the only AH is this situation in this scenario is your dear husband.  He should have made arrangements to pick you up.\n\nI hope you are feeling better.\n\nIf they have prescribed an after care program, make sure and do that as well.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA However, It would be nice of you to write her message, and a give her a small gift to show your appreciation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I suspect that your SIL needs to be in the hospital if she believes that you were faking being in the hospital for any reason. You asked for a ride and your MIL agreed. End of story. It has nothing to do with your SIL.", "NTA\n\nAnd lol@ being accused of faking it at discharge.  The time for that accusation is before the trained professionals admit you for treatment.  \n\nNext she'll gaslight you because the horrible people can't decide if you're faking it all or if you really are crazy which means they are innocent.  \n\nYour MIL could get better at communication and at least mention she had plans to see if you can make alternative arrangements, but she's a grown woman capable of deciding for herself where priorities are and this time it was you.  SIL can get over it.", "You probably saved mil from having to spend the day with her daughter, she sounds like a joy", "NTA \n\nAlso\u2026 as someone who has picked people up from psych hospitals after treatment\u2026 being there for family in that moment is more important than almost any other plans. It\u2019s not manipulation to ask, and you\u2019re not \u201cfaking it\u201d if you were admitted for treatment. Legit professionals decided you have a condition that would benefit from treatment. \n\nIdk what the SIL\u2019s problem is, but don\u2019t let her get to you.", "That's what I was thinking. SIL sounds like she could benefit from a few days being surrounded by professionals.", "[deleted]", "They don\u2019t always tell you when you\u2019re being discharged. I was told I\u2019d go home on a Saturday. On Friday morning psych and the medical cleared me and I was packing up to go an hour later.", "They don\u2019t tell you exactly what time you\u2019re leaving.  The husband also may have used all his personal time already this year, would have gotten fired if he didn\u2019t come in, couldn\u2019t afford to take the time off, or any one of a hundred reasons.", "Don\u2019t know if this is the case, but there are too many employers (mostly retail and service) that would penalize an absence no matter what the reason is. I give him the benefit of the doubt for this reason since I don\u2019t know otherwise.", "The SIL is an AH too, along with the husband.", "The MIL should\u2019ve knocked out two birds with one stone and brought the SIL with her on her way to pick OP up. \n\nThat said it\u2019s nice to actually read about a good MIL on here for once.", "[deleted]", "I worked at a nursing home where it got to the point I never believed what we were told about when people would be coming from the hospital. \"This person will be here today\" (we won't see them for two weeks) \"this person won't be here for a while (they are coming tonight when we're at our busiest)", "I was just adding to yours. My bad. I\u2019ll delete it then. It was just another note.", "It\u2019s like that in a lot of medical facilities. I\u2019ve been in icu and moved to cardiac unit before psych. Took me three days on cardiac unit with a sitter to get to psych when they told me it would be one night. Doctor didn\u2019t even know how many days I had been on meds and he told me refusal to take them would land me in psych permanently. \n\nI worked at a groups home and assisted livings where they change dates last minute and then give us NO information or updates on the resident. Happens in rehabs as well. It\u2019s wild to think how little communication there is in a system that concerns people\u2019s health."]}
