{"id": 30091, "submission_id": "17l8neg", "title": "AITA for refusing to come home for Christmas unless my parents have my brother start paying them back on his legal bills?", "selftext": "The situation involves myself (28F), my parents (60s), and my brothers (1 older 2 younger). \n\nThe financial context is that I am fortunate to be making a solid salary but have a stressful job. Since my dad is retired and due to cost of college, my parents are now very tight on money. \n\nThis week, my mom had asked for me to lend them $3K for my little brother\u2019s tuition payment as the financial aid office was months behind on processing and they would pay me back by the end of this year.  I had offered in the past that if they really needed it I could lend a few $k for my little brother\u2019s tuition but was uncomfortable with being asked. I reluctantly sent the money. \n\nI then asked my mom what the status was on my older brother paying them back on his legal fees / related expenses. For context, my brother has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the impulsiveness that comes with it led to some pretty poor decisions and legal issues. Over the years he owes my parents $8k-$10k in legal and related fees. He luckily is in a more stable position now and while he makes an ok salary he\u2019s able to pay rent and otherwise support himself and has enough money for domestic trips / nice dinners out / etc. \n\nMy mom informed me that he had paid them \u201ca little bit\u201d of what he owes them but she isn\u2019t pressuring him to pay them back at the moment as he is paying off (unrelated) medical bills. I was frustrated because I was under the impression he was continuously paying it down over the years. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may have crossed the line. I live on the opposite coast as my immediate family and it\u2019s expensive to pay for myself to fly home for Christmas. I told my mom that if she doesn\u2019t have my brother at least start making smaller \u201cgood faith\u201d payments that can be larger once his medical bills are paid off, then I\u2019m not coming home for Christmas. I don\u2019t feel comfortable that I\u2019m effectively bailing him and my parents out because they refuse to hold him accountable. He could cut down on dinners out / etc (which he has frequent / expensive dinners out) and start to pay them back. \n\nMy mom feels like I\u2019m trying to control her actions (which - I am - since it\u2019s now affecting me) and doesn\u2019t want to pressure my brother because she doesn\u2019t want him to end up in a bad depressive state. I think that having a frank conversation to have him start paying back in increments that won\u2019t be a financial burden is an extremely reasonable ask given their financial state.

I don\u2019t have the energy to explain but I come from a similar family. I\u2019m not well off myself financially but I\u2019ve seen my brother tread a similar path to your brother.", "NTA, your mom had no issue pressuring you for money when your sibling needed it, but now she has an issue pressuring him to pay it back?", "YTA\n\nLife is short.  Don't miss a Christmas. \n\nYour brother owes them money. It's only 8-10k. Odds are they still would have needed to borrow the 3k lump sum from you even if he was paying them back. Honestly,  if you parents can't afford a 3k \"emergency \" at their age they have much bigger financial issues than the amount your brother owes them. They probably shouldn't be retired.\n\nI know it feels unfair.  It is.", "To be honest I am confused about this post. You offered to help, but then became uncomfortable when they took you up on the offer and in response decided to blackmail/punish your parents for your change of heart rather just saying you changed you mind? YTA.", "While, I completely understand your frustration and slight outrage, I think it's a soft YTA.\n\nYour mom is right that you do not get to control her actions. Your brother's debt is between him and them. You don't get a say in it. What you get a say in, is whether you loan your parents money again.\n\nYou have made the loan to help with your brother's tuition. I'm not experienced with student loans, but it sounds strange to me that the institution would be behind on processing them. However, it should still get processed sometime soon and the loan from you should be repaid. So the loan you made for your brother's tuition is not part of the equation with your older brother's debt.\n\nYou are choosing to hold your visits hostage to coercing your parents into getting more money from your brother. Visit your family at Christmas if you want; don't if you don't. You don't even need or want to hold anything hostage to coercing your parents to follow your wishes regarding older brother. You can simply tell them you are unwilling to loan or give them any money when they are unwilling to collect on a debt someone else owes them. It actually remains your parents' choice whether they seek money from older brother or they live without funds.", "YTA, you should have said no to lending them money in the first place if you were uncomfortable about it. Your brother paying back your parents is separate to the loan you offered them (why offer if you didn't want to give it, I don't understand?)", "Your parents can do whatever they want with their money. As long as they don't ask you for money.\n\nOnce they ask it's a whole different situation.. I don't think I would go home either.", "I think a lot of this responses don\u2019t understand the pressure of parenting an adult child with a severe mental health illness. The fear of a relapse is terrifying. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t want to lend the money you shouldn\u2019t have offered. And now emotionally blackmailing your parents is a total dick move. Go home for Xmas and be grateful you have parents who are trying to do their best by their kids with very different challenges or stay at home graciously. \n\nYTA", "Yes, I think YTA.\n\nYou have absolutely no obligation to help if you don't want to or feel that money isn't being put to good use (though if I understand you correctly you're the one who offered in the first place), but you shouldn't meddle in the way your parents handle their financial entanglements with your older brother. It's simply not your business, especially as from your story they were asking you for a **loan** while they waited for a payment to come through, not to **give** them money to spend on him. If they want to help him even if it means money is tight for them, that's up to them. You're too old to be keeping score.\n\nIf that loan made it hard for you to pay for a flight home, you'd be justified in taking a rain check. Using it as a threat or as a form of leverage is just petty.\n\nI would also like to urge you to ask yourself if your reaction would have been the same if your brother had borrowed 10 or even 100k from your parents to pay for cancer treatment, for instance. If the answer is no, maybe it's time for you to realise that bipolar disease is not a made-up problem.", "NTA they have to borrow money from you when he owes them more than they borrowed. It\u2019s ridiculous. Your parents enable him and that\u2019s why he owes them so much money.", "Why are you having this conversation with your parents?  Why aren't you having it with your brother?  It's his behavior that you are trying to change.", "Against popular opinion, YTA.\n\nUnless you paid your own college tuition, consider your loan a repayment of your tuition fees. \n\nIf you are opposed to loaning them money, don't loan them any money.  You can bet with your controlling nature and threats about not going home for Christmas,  your mom will lie to you in the future. \n\nBut saying all of that I totally get where you are coming from.   If it was me, I wouldn't be loaning any money again.", "NTA, determine what your willing to do and not do, tell your mom and stick to those boundaries. However, I would quit giving them \u201cloans,\u201d everyone in this family is broke so I suggest making a gift and let it go. Also, it\u2019s important to know your limits and tell you mom that because otherwise she will keep bailing your brother out and calling you for money.", "You helped out your younger brother with some money for tuition because the financial aid office was behind and you're getting this money back by the end of the year. Good, I don't see any problems here.\n\nNow there's this other situation that you are not involved in where your parents helped out your other brother in the past. It's between them to figure out repayment and you're not involved in this in any way.\n\nSo why are you making such a big deal out of it now that you've helped out your other brother on something totally unrelated? You're getting that money back and it doesn't sound like you can't miss it for a few months. \n\nAnd now you're 'threatening' your parents by saying you won't come for Christmas, because... there's this situation that you're not involved in? YTA.", "So you have 2 brothers. You offered to help if needed on the younger brother but wasn\u2019t a happy about actually having to help. So you decided to punish your parents by bringing up the older brother who had nothing to do with the younger brother and thus say unless he pays them back even a little, you won\u2019t see them and now seem to not want to help your younger brother either with college/his education. \n\nYou are punishing someone not involved or responsible for your older brother (your younger brother). You\u2019re punishing your parents because you don\u2019t agree with how they\u2019re handling your older brother. \n\nYour older brother is also paying medical bills which affect his overall future more than the legal fees your parents helped pay. Meaning he can take the time to pay your parents, he can\u2019t take the time to pay the medical bills(collections, credit scores, even insurance coverage can be affected by medical debt) \n\nYes YTA. And a bit cold hearted. You rather refuse to see your family than keep your nose out of the relationship between your parents and brother. They even said they would pay you back and still.. you want to cut your nose off in spite of yourself pretty much. I get that it\u2019s frustrating but it\u2019s not your problem. It would be a thousand times different if they said they wouldn\u2019t pay you back or if it was going to your older brother. But it\u2019s not.", "You already sent them the cost of your airfare and then some to cover your brother's tuition. Your parents want you home for Christmas, the deadbeat they should have asked to repay his loan can pay your way as part of his debt to your parents. NTA", "Bro it\u2019s family, if you care about money then don\u2019t talk to your family, I bought my sisters and little brother houses and pay off their mortgages even though they got their own businesses, you only have family once in this life time and if money is gonna get in the way, then cut yourself out and you do you and let them do them", "YTA for giving them more money when you knew it was being thrown down your brother's black hole; and then demanding he pay them back. This was a fool's errand. Keep your money for yourself and stay out of the rest of it. This is your parents' problem and now you have inserted yourself in the middle.", "ESH. You offered to help if they really needed it. They took you up on your offer. Your parents should expect your older brother to pay them back and he should do so, but it\u2019s understandable that they\u2019re letting him pay back medical bills first. You not going home for Xmas is not related to the issue at hand, so it\u2019s a foolish threat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe retiring with a kid still needing financial support and money \u201cbeing tight\u201d wasn\u2019t the best idea.

What your parents do with their money is up to them - whether they ask for repayment or not. Whether you lend money for your younger brother or not is up to you, as is the cost of flying home for Christmas.\nDon't make one dependent on the other. Either you are OK to lend money to younger brother's education, or you aren't. Of course you have a right to expect that parents will do it instead, but the reason why they can't isn't your business. In the same way that you don't have to 'lend' the money because it isn't your child, just your brother.\nYou might not want to spend Christmas with your older brother. that's fine - your choice. But you can't try and blackmail your parents.\nYes I know lots of entitled parents and others create these false equivalents - but you aren't entitled (are you?) so you wouldn't do that", "YTA  \n\n\nIt's ok to be uncomfortable leaning your parents $$$, and it's ok to expect a repayment schedule from them.  \n\n\nIt's not OK to demand how and when they ask for repayment from your sibling, who has suffered from years of instability and poor health. That is between them.   \n\n\nIt's an AH move to withold your presence over the holiday, over finacial decisions that are none of you business.", "It\u2019s pretty rare when someone who takes money is too busy to take money.", "Yep, it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m even involved in this situation you know? Like - you need money - you have a kid who owes you money and somehow has enough disposable income to have opinions on oysters - why am I involved here? Ugh. Hearts out to you too", "This is a helpful perspective because this is probably how my mom is viewing it. Had I known that my older brother wasn\u2019t actively paying it off I would\u2019ve have had that been a condition of me lending the money in the first place. But I am trying to stop the dynamic of me bailing them out being an \u201ceasier\u201d option for them than actually holding my brother accountable so open to any suggestions you have to make that point too.", "I'm sure OP loves her family, but that doesn't mean they're entitled to her money, even between family members some boundaries must be placed to keep the peace and not let anyone get taken advantage of and cheated.\nI understand that the brother went through some rough times but he is in a better place in his life now, he has a good job, and apparently gets paid enough to go out very often and have fun, OP isn't drowning in money, yet she's somehow the one they go to every time they need money even though the son that already owes them alot of money that he's capable of repaying isn't expectedto help.\nIt's not like she's leaving them to dust, but she doesn't want to be taken advantage of either, and I think that's a valid demand.\nIf the parents don't want to trouble there son to give them money they ARE entitled to get back, then the shouldn't ask OP for money they're not entitled to.", "That's the part that got me. I probably would have been a lot more blunt in my response than you were. So I'm definitely thinking you're not the asshole in this scenario.\n\nThe minute I found out my older brother wasn't making regular payments to them I would have lost my shit. I would have made it very clear to my parents that under no circumstances would I allow them to borrow any more money from me until he gave up his nice dinner's out and vacations to pay them back.\n\nYou definitely should have asked your mother how she thought it was right/fair to ask you for money when he hasn't paid them back yet, and it's been years.", "Best to stop lending money with any expectation of repayment or interfering in the finances of the older brother.

If you don\u2019t, then don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t think you have a right to make your brother paying a debt part of a condition to you coming home. \n\nInstead, I would call your mom back and just flat out tell her that you didn\u2019t realize your brother had not paid them back, and that from this point forward, you no longer feel comfortable lending any of them any money. And then tell her you still expect to be paid back by year end as agreed. She might be upset and say that\u2019s between her and your brother, but part of taking accountability for what you\u2019ve done is paying debts. \n\nLastly, don\u2019t offer to lend money to family.

They want him to continue that way and think forcing him into frugal living to pay them back will set him back. Him working and paying medical debt is better than him reverting and racking up legal troubles and costs.\n\nLend them the money, go home for Christmas and tell them if they don't pay you back no further loans will be forthcoming. They're trying to keep your brother well enough to not need bailing out again, I wouldn't support them in giving him more money but giving him a chance to do better by not insisting he repay debt immediately isn't enabling him.\n\nYour brother likely had difficulties before his diagnosis and it's easy for parents to overlook \"easy\" children when they have a really \"hard\" one. If you think that happened, talk to them about that, don't make Christmas the hill you die on just because you don't agree with what they think your brother can cope with.", "NTA But you are lying to yourself a little OP. It\u2019s not just that brother isn\u2019t paying them back. You were immediately uncomfortable upon being asked for that 3k. You still thought he was paying them back at that point, so learning he wasn\u2019t only exacerbated an already existing issue. \n\nWas the 3k more than you could comfortably give? Are you (rightfully) frustrated at how often you\u2019re being asked for money? Whatever the issue, it\u2019s deeper than just your irresponsible brother."]}
