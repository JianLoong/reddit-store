{"id": 30091, "submission_id": "17l8neg", "title": "AITA for refusing to come home for Christmas unless my parents have my brother start paying them back on his legal bills?", "selftext": "The situation involves myself (28F), my parents (60s), and my brothers (1 older 2 younger). \n\nThe financial context is that I am fortunate to be making a solid salary but have a stressful job. Since my dad is retired and due to cost of college, my parents are now very tight on money. \n\nThis week, my mom had asked for me to lend them $3K for my little brother\u2019s tuition payment as the financial aid office was months behind on processing and they would pay me back by the end of this year.  I had offered in the past that if they really needed it I could lend a few $k for my little brother\u2019s tuition but was uncomfortable with being asked. I reluctantly sent the money. \n\nI then asked my mom what the status was on my older brother paying them back on his legal fees / related expenses. For context, my brother has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the impulsiveness that comes with it led to some pretty poor decisions and legal issues. Over the years he owes my parents $8k-$10k in legal and related fees. He luckily is in a more stable position now and while he makes an ok salary he\u2019s able to pay rent and otherwise support himself and has enough money for domestic trips / nice dinners out / etc. \n\nMy mom informed me that he had paid them \u201ca little bit\u201d of what he owes them but she isn\u2019t pressuring him to pay them back at the moment as he is paying off (unrelated) medical bills. I was frustrated because I was under the impression he was continuously paying it down over the years. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may have crossed the line. I live on the opposite coast as my immediate family and it\u2019s expensive to pay for myself to fly home for Christmas. I told my mom that if she doesn\u2019t have my brother at least start making smaller \u201cgood faith\u201d payments that can be larger once his medical bills are paid off, then I\u2019m not coming home for Christmas. I don\u2019t feel comfortable that I\u2019m effectively bailing him and my parents out because they refuse to hold him accountable. He could cut down on dinners out / etc (which he has frequent / expensive dinners out) and start to pay them back. \n\nMy mom feels like I\u2019m trying to control her actions (which - I am - since it\u2019s now affecting me) and doesn\u2019t want to pressure my brother because she doesn\u2019t want him to end up in a bad depressive state. I think that having a frank conversation to have him start paying back in increments that won\u2019t be a financial burden is an extremely reasonable ask given their financial state. So Reddit, AITA?\n\n(Edit - because I cut down due to character size - but the Christmas issue is because it\u2019s usually $750+ of my own money to fly home and I feel uncomfortable that I was asked for money and I then find out there isn\u2019t even progress being made on the legal fees / etc. And I really do mean very small good faith payments (like $30-50 a month) until the medical debt is paid off but I\u2019m just concerned they\u2019ll avoid asking for way too long on it knowing my parents and continue to be tight on money).\n\n(Edit 2 - wow, this blew up. One item I\u2019d like to clarify is everyone asking why I lent money when I wasn\u2019t comfortable / had offered if really needed. The person who would suffer if I didn\u2019t lend the money was my youngest brother - I would never want him to not be able to enroll in classes because of financial issues, and I\u2019d cover not as a gift if I needed to, and he\u2019s blameless in this situation.

Your brother's debt is between him and them. You don't get a say in it. What you get a say in, is whether you loan your parents money again.\n\nYou have made the loan to help with your brother's tuition. I'm not experienced with student loans, but it sounds strange to me that the institution would be behind on processing them. However, it should still get processed sometime soon and the loan from you should be repaid. So the loan you made for your brother's tuition is not part of the equation with your older brother's debt.\n\nYou are choosing to hold your visits hostage to coercing your parents into getting more money from your brother. Visit your family at Christmas if you want; don't if you don't. You don't even need or want to hold anything hostage to coercing your parents to follow your wishes regarding older brother. You can simply tell them you are unwilling to loan or give them any money when they are unwilling to collect on a debt someone else owes them. It actually remains your parents' choice whether they seek money from older brother or they live without funds.", "YTA, you should have said no to lending them money in the first place if you were uncomfortable about it.

It's simply not your business, especially as from your story they were asking you for a **loan** while they waited for a payment to come through, not to **give** them money to spend on him. If they want to help him even if it means money is tight for them, that's up to them. You're too old to be keeping score.\n\nIf that loan made it hard for you to pay for a flight home, you'd be justified in taking a rain check. Using it as a threat or as a form of leverage is just petty.\n\nI would also like to urge you to ask yourself if your reaction would have been the same if your brother had borrowed 10 or even 100k from your parents to pay for cancer treatment, for instance. If the answer is no, maybe it's time for you to realise that bipolar disease is not a made-up problem.", "NTA they have to borrow money from you when he owes them more than they borrowed.

Good, I don't see any problems here.\n\nNow there's this other situation that you are not involved in where your parents helped out your other brother in the past. It's between them to figure out repayment and you're not involved in this in any way.\n\nSo why are you making such a big deal out of it now that you've helped out your other brother on something totally unrelated?

You\u2019re punishing your parents because you don\u2019t agree with how they\u2019re handling your older brother. \n\nYour older brother is also paying medical bills which affect his overall future more than the legal fees your parents helped pay.

Yes, your brother did some stupid things and your parents paid for this, but he IS sick. He had mental illness. It\u2019s not his fault he has it. \nNow, when was he diagnosed, was he diagnosed before or after the \u201clegal problems\u201d. Frankly speaking even if he never gives the money back it\u2019s not YOUR business. Your parents are probably feeling guilty over his actions but also over his illness. They are afraid if they pressure he\u2019s gonna switch. Are they right? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s between them, him and his therapist. You clearly fault him for whatever happened and don\u2019t care about him being sick.

And if you didn't want to loan them money for your little brother's tuition, why did you offer in the past?  \n\nPayments of $30 a month wouldn't have changed your present circumstances and I'm sure you know that - if someone was paying me back $30 a month it would simply go into the regular budget and wouldn't put me any farther ahead or go into any kind of savings account, if my budget is already close to the bone.

TBH, I think some therapy would help you a great deal.  Your parents don't sound like awful people - just people who were dealt a hand they weren't expecting and did the best they could do. \n\nAs for the tuition, look at it this way.  The better your little brother does now in college, the more apt he is to be able to be of assistance to you when/if your parents need help in the future.", "Yup, YTA. This was their money that they loaned him when your brother needed it. Because he has not repaid them they have to ask you to help with the other brother's schooling. All of that is unrelated to you flying home for the holidays. So you are holding them emotionally hostage over a totally different matter.   \n\n\nAll right, big boy/girl talk. You live across the country and it is tough to go home for the holidays, not the least because airfare and travel costs are much higher around the holidays. So going forward you should consider going every other year, or go home at a slightly different time so that it is more affordable. When (or if) you get into a relationship this will be inevitable since you'll now have two sets of family to visit.   \n\n\nTwo, family and money. Those are two topics that are terrible to mix together. Talk to your brother, not your parents, about his debts to them.

Question I have is why isn't little brother able to come up with the money for his own tuition? I come from an age where we had to pay our own tuition and loans, went to school full- time as well as worked full-time. Your parents shouldn't have to stretch what already sounds like a very tight budget to pay for anything tuition related. And what happens if after the first of the year, they still can't pay you back? As far as older brother- well I can tell you that while impulse issues can be related to bi-polar disorder, most of us who suffer with it are capable of making good choices. And your parents fearing he will get depressed if they bring up him making payments are just giving him an out for every time he doesn't like something they do or require him to do. I am bi-polar, and I live on social security. When I owe someone money I pay them. It may take me a few months, but they get a payment every month until it's paid off. I don't go out, I don't buy anything unnecessary, or go on trips until that debt is paid in full. So your older brother not paying back your parents, is rediculous.\nNow here's the only issue I have with you not going to your parents for the holidays.

So are you willing to take that chance just to stand on principle?", "Did your parents help you pay for college?", "I understand your decision but have you been there while your brother was going through his crisis.

It\u2019s frustrating but it prevents students from getting aid, getting huge refunds and then dropping all their classes and never paying the school back. If they have to wait until later to get their money, they will receive consequences on their transcripts for dropping classes to keep the money.", "This is an important perspective for anyone who finds themselves in OP's position. I'm not super in love with the fact that it's gotten to a point where they felt the need to ask for help from another sibling to help the third sibling, but another commenter mentioned that that third sibling may need to consider making some adjustments to how his tuition gets paid as the financial situation is shifting. Their financial troubles run deeper than what older brother has caused. A lot of older adults are running into situations where they realized they had been running a higher cost of living than they'd be able to keep up with by the time their children grew up, promised too much, and are now feeling the pressure. I'm willing to guess that if little brother is getting his tuition paid for, those were some perks OP once enjoyed that are not afforded to everyone. But, when the parents started paying for things like college tuition they didn't account for how much more it would cost to cover things like that over time. Many didn't.\n\nAs for the older brother, I have perspective of my own to offer and I so rarely do in this sub because people are wildly against people who say things that I'm about to say, because the nuance is a lot more difficult to navigate when it's you. I am severely mentally ill. Severely. I've been in treatment and hospitals several times a year at my lowest points, and have come close enough to de-living that I have permanent heart damage. I've been lucky enough to have never lost the ACA coverage I've had even though my employment situation has been patchy at best; I always manage to break even, but I barely make enough to survive.\n\nI will never be able to pay my parents back while they're alive for the things they've done to help me continue to exist. Never. We all know it, and they don't hurt me for it, though I know I've caused a lot of stress for them and continue to do so. I am consistent with my treatment, and I hold down my jobs until I can't function anymore. I currently work three that have schedules that are flexible, and a couple occasionally pay well. I used to pay rent because I needed to feel independent and reliable, but my mom, dad, and stepmom all agreed that they would prefer if I sock that money into savings or pay off my financial debts, which is... a lot more than most people make in a year. \n\nI don't drink or smoke anymore, because those were obviously not helpful in general, and my mental health has improved a ton, but I'm still constantly fighting my brain for lengths of time where I can't function and it costs me personally and professionally. I need to stress again that I'm on top of treatment for this but it is very unlikely that I will ever be able to function consistently enough to not prepare for a major setback. \n\nHere is what my parents expect for me to \"repay\" their above and beyond help: I need to have some kind of job. Even if I work two days a week. The rest of the time I have to maintain some kind of schedule that keeps me from losing routines. They're beyond caring if I can support myself or ever live on my own. I don't think they would even be comfortable with that because the unknown scares them. It looks like I have an active \"extravagant\" life, but a lot of times my friends take me out because I have some really good ones who want me to be included in the world and will sometimes take me to dinners and concerts. I have cut back on the big adventures to nearly nothing and limit myself to one or two concerts or whatever a year. If I didn't have these few allowances for myself, I wouldn't have things to look forward to. I wouldn't have anything that makes life feel worthwhile. My parents urge me to be careful because of how easy it is to go overboard with these things, but ultimately they have their kid back and know that within reason, it's better for me to save up for things I really want to do to maintain balance than to exist only to pay them back and then disappear into my room. Their child wants to live.\n\nThis is getting long but I need to drive home the point that I understand the sacrifices my family has made, and how difficult it has been to be around me. It took me a long time to figure out how to show them how much I appreciate what they've done when most people like me would just be on the street and fade away. That's the alternative. I do what I can to repay them but I also let nothing they've done go to waste. I'm still here because of their help. I'm extremely privileged and I know that. I know that my stepmom has daughters who have likely not gotten the same amount of assistance (one has, in worse shape than me) and telling them that it's different for them because they will always land on their feet feels inadequate and I understand how frustrated they must feel. It must seem like I have been rewarded for laziness where they had to work their asses off without the same help. They've all been put in positions they wouldn't have chosen for themselves, but my parents at the end of the day have finally understood that I would not have chosen this for myself either, and WISH I could have leaned on others a little less. It becomes a cycle; the guilt for not measuring up can end up landing me at a low point where I have to retrain my brain away from feeling worthless so I do not become more of a burden.  \n\n\ntldr; other siblings do suffer when there is a mentally ill sibling, but sometimes the relief that their child seems to finally be okay after some of the scariest moments a parent can go through trumps the financial strain. and the financial strain may not be entirely a result of what the sibling has gone through, but a long string of decision making that has caught up to them. Ultimately NTA or NAH. Mental health issues are a bitch and it affects more than the person suffering.

Like the post you're replying to said, you needs things to life for, otherwise whats the point. If he had no debt it might be a different conversation, but he's regularily paying off medical bills and your parents are reluctant to put more pressure on him when things are going well because in the grand scheme of things from their perspective he hasn't been doing well that long. \n2. My relationship with my parents got a lot better when I sat down with a family therapist, WITHOUT my brother, and told them very frankly how I felt about everything and the impact their actions had on me, then genuinely listened when they explained and apologized. Having the therapist was a very important mediator and I can't promise it will go as well with your own parents, but I genuinely have a very good relationship with my parents now. I can meet them more as equals, understanding that they did what they did out of love and fear - fear that my brother would hut someone (whether that be himself or someone else) and that they would loose their child. That doesn't make it all okay, but nobody's perfect and they've apologized for where they failed and its made us a lot stronger as a family. \n\nGood luck with everything, I hope you can come to a resolution with your family, and remember your parents are probably just doing the best they can in a shitty situation nobody asked for.", "Typically, financial aid is paid directly to the school, then the student gets anything left over.
