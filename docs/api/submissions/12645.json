She had a babysitter (27F) \u201cRachel\u201d who was hired by our parents because I\u2019m too busy with school and work to watch her every day, and they are both full time workers as well. \n\nA few weeks ago while I was scrolling on TikTok, I got recommended Rachel\u2019s account. I clicked on it out of curiosity, but was shocked to see that she had over a dozen videos featuring Maria. In one, Maria seems to be having a sort of meltdown and she\u2019s crying and yelling. Another of her videos had over 300k views. Rachel\u2019s account also had other videos with children in them, presumably ones she babysat. Several of them included the children in distress while Rachel just filmed. She was also using her full name and general location on her account, which is obviously really dangerous.\n\nI immediately told my parents, who didn\u2019t initially understand why I was mad until I showed them how easily people could find us through some googling and Facebook. They fired Rachel and made her take down the videos, which she did, though she was really angry about it and didn\u2019t seem to understand what was wrong. \n\nWhen I went to check her account, all the other kids in the videos were still there, she had only taken down the ones with Maria because we asked. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how since she didn\u2019t ask us permission, she probably didn\u2019t ask any other family. One of them was a friend of ours, so I decided to contact them just to ask if they knew. \n\nAs it turns out, that family was mortified by it, and managed to let every other family Rachel babysat for know what happened by posting on Facebook. Rachel is now apparently completely out of a job and is freaking out. Her TikTok is deleted now. I honestly feel bad - I don\u2019t think what she did was right and I don\u2019t regret telling people, but I didn\u2019t think it was necessary to basically cut off her entire source of income. I had no idea this would happen. I feel like I might be TA because I jumped straight to contacting other families. Maybe I should have asked Rachel first, though I don\u2019t think she would\u2019ve listened to me.", "created_utc": 1679199888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vb7l5/aita_for_getting_a_babysitter_fired_after_she/", "score": 310, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Extra weird that she\u2019s 27 and behaving this way.", "NTA. It's bad enough to post other people's children on social media without a parent's permission, but to do so on a public page and give the child's full name and location? Is she *trying* to get those kids trafficked or abducted, because that's how that happens. Don't be sorry for protecting those kids from someone who is old enough to know better but values likes and comments over safety.", "NTA If her job was that important to her, she should have actually done it instead of filming children in distress for the entertainment of strangers.

How can a grown ass adult not understand the danger she is exposing every single child she's uploading to? Not only did she upload without consent of the parents, as they are children that cannot consent to having their faces plastered over the internet (in the middle of a meltdown? wtf is she filming that for??) , but she's broadcasting her location and full name for every predator out there to see.

At all. Even if you had spoken to Rachel first and she immediately took down all the videos, the families still needed to know about them. Their children, who are not old enough to consent to being put online, have been exploited and put out there where predators can easily locate them. There are so many things wrong with what she was doing, beyond the obvious of not giving adequate child care if her first priority is filming. You absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA she filmed a child in distress WTF is wrong with her. She was being paid to be a caregiver and what she did was cruel and unsafe.

She doesn't take care of them; she endangers them.\n\nGood for you!", "You did what you were supposed to do, that is, to protect your little sister.", "NTA- Rachel needed to ask permission to post even record. For her to have her general location is completely inconsiderate of her. If your are babysitting another human, she is at a job, she shouldn\u2019t be on her phone since she is supposed to be taking care of another person. I understand that TIKTOK is her \u201cother source of income\u201d but there is a time/place to do so. You have EVERY REASON, to have done what you did, because I would have done the same!", "NTA, she had no permission to record in the first place. \n\nNot only videos or pictures, she also leaked personal information and other parents were kept in dark and probably would not know unless they were notified.", "With it becoming increasingly apparent that there are very unwell people on the internet and what they do with videos of children online, posting other people's kids for views and clout is beyond irresponsible and potentially dangerous or traumatic for those kids in the future.

NTA", "NTA, there was a story a while, back about a family blogger channel on YouTube, and one of the daughters who was I think 7-8 got a whole bunch of male stockers all from the ages of around 25 to 42, they would stock her outside her house, they would follow her and watch her while she was in school, and some of them would even send her gifts, it got so bad that the blogger family had to take down their YouTube account because the daughter had so many stockers, so yeah, OP what the babysitter did was incredibly dangerous and she should be fired, at 27 she should know that filming children without the parents, consent or permission is just asking for trouble", "NTA! You did the right thing.", "Absolutely NTA. What she did was a huge breach of trust, not only of the parents, but the children under her care. I don\u2019t post pictures of my own children without their consent. And you did the right thing contacting the families. She should have known better; if she didn\u2019t, this isn\u2019t the right job for her. More importantly, the parents needed to know this was happening, not only to protect their children in this situation, but to know what to look out for next time they hire a babysitter.", "NTA **AT ALL** and good for you. You can't just put someone else's child on the internet. What she did was incredibly unsafe, plus leaving a weeping child in distress to make a video shows she was a terrible babysitter. Good on you ND good on the other family for letting everyone know. The kids do not deserve that.", "NTA. Posting names and locations of children, whether it\u2019s in real time or not, can be incredibly dangerous for everyone involved. As a parent, I appreciate the length you went to protect your sister, and in turn all the other children in Rachel\u2019s care. Sure it\u2019s lousy that she\u2019s out of a job, but this was a betrayal of trust and a danger, and she brought it on herself.", "NTA. If Rachel didn\u2019t want this to happen, she shouldn\u2019t have been posting videos of young children without their parents\u2019 consent for internet clout. Simple as that.", "NTA\nShe was posting pictures without parental consent, risking the children by including locations, and filming kids in distress instead of tending to them.", "NTA you did the right thing.", "NTA and if I was the parent, I would have called the police. Posting that kind of content is definitely illegal.", "NTA, she was posting other people\u2019s children for social media clout and posting these kids without their parents\u2019 permission. She was also apparently not taking care of these kids if they\u2019re clearly distressed in all the videos. All this on top of letting any creep know exactly where these children are. She clearly saw nothing wrong with it when she didn\u2019t immediately remove all the videos after your parents fired her for it. That should have been a big clue, although she should have already known, that what she was doing wasn\u2019t ok. You didn\u2019t get Rachel fired. Rachel got herself fired because she cared more about internet likes than keeping her job. Hopefully she learns from it but hopefully she isn\u2019t working with kids any time soon.\n\nI\u2019m a nanny and I take pictures and videos of the kids I watch to show their parents.

Any students under my charge need to have their parents sign a media waiver for me to take pictures in my classroom that may get posted to the school website.

What you did was not only keep your sister safe, but so many other children!!", "It should be made absolutely clear to the babysitter that no pictures of the children they are caring for ( or their homes; personal belongings etc ) are to be taken - much less posted to social media of any kind.
