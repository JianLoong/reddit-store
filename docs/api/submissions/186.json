That is extremely hard to do, and tells me she is not a safe person.", "Sibling is old enough to know her own limits and boundaries. The fact that you got custody over her bio parent says a lot to me about how the situation with your mom was. NTA at all", "The very fact that she lost custody of your sibling in favor of you, a 19-year-old, suggests there was some serious abuse going on. \n\nYour first priority is to keep your sibling safe, not appease your mother. NTA.", "Nta. If you got custody of your sibling there had to be a good reason. Protect your sibling. If she were such a great mom that sacrificed for her children she wouldn't have lost custody.", "NTA. The court gave you custody of your sibling because their current environment (being raised by your mother) was dangerous. Courts don\u2019t do that lightly. That\u2019s not in your head, and well within your rights to do. Particularly if your sibling expressed they don\u2019t want to see their mom.", "NTA \n\nFrom the switching of the pronouns, I am guessing that your younger sibling came out as ~~nonbinary~~ or genderfluid and mom didn't care for that one little bit and caused a huge stink about the whole thing.\n\nIf that is the case, keep your sibling far away for as long as she chooses to be. If he ever wants a meeting, *then* you can arrange it in your terms (neutral location, etc).\n\nEdit. Reread it and see the gf now \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, duh. Lol. Sorry.", "NTA\u2026 there is a reason you were awarded custody. You\u2019re doing the right thing. Maybe take some time away from grandma since she doesn\u2019t understand. Peace is everything in life.", "Lol NTA ....if you at 19 have custody over your 16 yr old sibling there is no shadow of a doubt your mother isn't capable of looking after you . Custody isn't just handed around it's fucking serious , you're barely an adult and a judge deemed it more appropriate for you to look after a child than your own mother . Sounds like you're grandma needs to stay away to .", "NTA. You would not have custody of your sibling without very good reason. I am sure you were given custody on the understanding that you would protect him. It seems to me that that is exactly what you are doing.", "If Ri doesn't want to see her, I wouldn't force her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou have custody of her so you are meant to protect her and keep her safe. I'm not going to pry but I imagine if they've taken custuody off a mother and handed it to a 19 year old, she really isn't safe.\n\nBesides 16 is old enough to know about limits and boundaries etc.", "NTA. Your gran is suspect. I'd stay away from her too", "NTA. Your mom failed as a parent! She lost the right to demand anything of you and your sister. If she wants to reconnect, she better check her attitude first", "NTA - Let mom know if she keeps contacting you you'll get the police involved.\n\nDo not continue to engage as that keeps them feeling there is a chance, go NC and and let grandma know she can be NC also if she wants to back up your abuser.", "Definitely NTA, if this is how she behaves by trying to force visitation then the actual visit is going to be hellish.", "NTA - you\u2019re respecting your siblings wishes and keeping them safe from potentially more trauma.", "NTA and tell Granny to stay out of it.", "NTA and you don't listen to anyone but your sibling.

As someone with an extremely toxic mother, your best bet is to just help your sibling with their feelings and be there if and when they decide to meet with her. Doesn't matter if mom or grandma believe differently. Forcing contact will just cause massive psychological problems if and when they meet your mom. As for Grandma, unless she knows the whole story, she needs to stfu and stay out of it.", "NTA  Do as your sister wishes or follow court orders.", "NTA - You did what you need to do for both of you. Don't listen to what your grandmother says. In fact, is grandmother not the best either ( could some of your mom's situation be because of your grandmother? If a 19 year old was able to get legal custody of a sibling their mother has indeed not \"sacrificed so much for you two\". You aren't an AH. Cut contact with the GM if you need to.", "NTA. You're doing the right thing. The court gave her to you because they recognize the love and good intentions in your heart and trust you to make the best choices for her. Go with your gut and what you know is right.", "NTA. You stood your ground to get gf16 out of a bad place. Don't back down at 16 they're old enough to make that call. Protect like a mamma bear.", "The courts are not going to grant custody of a 16 year old to a 19 year old unless there are very strong reasons to get them out of the house. NTA", "NTA - Your job is now to protect your sibling. If they say they don't feel safe seeing your mother or grandmother, then that is all there is to it. Same thing goes for you as well. There's damn good reasons you guys got out and away from her. Those same reasons are all the justification you need to stay away for good, as well.\n\nIf granny wants to stick her nose in, tell her she will 100% be the next one that contact is cut with. If she cannot remain neutral and polite, there is no reason to have her around either.", "You don't get custody of your minor sibling when you're 19 for no reason.

If you've lost custody of your 16 year old to your 19 year old, you've already messed up so badly that your kids are well within their rights to go no contact. The fact that the mom can't even keep her shit together in public to visit you guys is just adding onto the list of reasons she doesn't deserve to see you. \n\nI'm glad your younger sibling has you. You're doing the right thing by protecting them from unwanted contact with your mom.", "Agreed! If a 19 year old got custody of their sibling then the mom fucked up big time. And if the grandmother is telling her that she needs to see her mother then I\u2019m guessing she has always enabled the mother. Don\u2019t be surprised if when you see your mom she tries to manipulate you in any way possible. OP need to set boundaries with both mom and grandmother or this will always happen. \n\nKeep doing what you are doing!!\n\nNTA in the slightest!", "(sibling not sister--Ri is genderfluid and OP uses shifting pronouns in the post!)", "This!! And I'd tell exactly that to the grandma next time she calls and tries to berate OP again. Cuz mom got grandma blinded in the palm of her hand apparently. That, or she learned it from grandma.", ">The court gave you custody of your sibling \n\nYou  might also want to double check your custody arrangement.  Does the court expect you to allow your mom to see your sibling? Does the court require it is a supervised visit, etc. \n\nNTA for respecting your sibling's boundaries. Just make sure you are following your custody agreement to the letter so you don't lose what you've won.", "Yup! Tell granny the only thing your mother ever sacrificed was her children's wellbeing and she doesn't get rewarded for that! Frankly i think blocking both of them is the lesser headache, but that is totally up to OP."]}
