Obviously, we divorced but I can say the cheating was just the tip of the iceberg with what Xs mother put me through. \n\nFor context, X had come from a relatively wealthy family growing up, I did not. This caused issues specifically w/ his mother. Whom did not approve of me because I grew up in a mobile home, \u201cif i wasn\u2019t raised in a house with a foundation, how could I possibly know how to build a healthy home for her son and future grandchildren,\u201d\n\nYes, she said this. To my face and consequently a room full of Xs and my family and friends- it was a Christmas party, the first year we were together. \n\nSo it\u2019s been about 3 yrs after the divorce. I have completely moved cities and careers to be as far away from X and fam as possible and I can say I\u2019ve honestly never been happier. Coincidentally, I won the lottery last year. I won\u2019t disclose how much or where for privacy reasons but it was a blessing in a time I felt the lowest and because I was blessed, I wanted to bless others. \n\nSo I have a goddaughter who is getting married. I know this sounds crazy but I had a dream & in the dream I gave my goddaughter a house for their wedding present. I haven\u2019t told a soul I plan to do this but I\u2019ve hired a realtor to put together some houses to look at.

It\u2019s in a great location in a neighboring city where my GD job is and it\u2019s a decent size for a couple just starting, my realtor even tells me the seller is even trying to close early because he\u2019s in the midst of a divorce after 32 years he finds out his son isn\u2019t his, but in fact, his brothers. YIKES. \n\nI don\u2019t think anything of it because why would I? I was just excited that I would be able to have more time if we closed on the house early to get it ready for my goddaughter. \n\nThe week comes for my appointment to see the house and almost had a heart attack in my car bc it is a familiar house. It\u2019s Xs family home, the one where his vile creature of a mother & dad live. Apparently Dad found out that X wasn\u2019t even his kid and that Mom had been having a 30 year affair with his brother. \n\nI bought the house. It was glorious. Anyways, GD is currently living there but now I am being bombarded by messages from X and fam on all sides about how wrong it was to \u2018maliciously seek out revenge\u2019 for buying a house that happened to belong to my exes family. It\u2019s cause a lot of drama because apparently my sister and X have been together this whole time and we\u2019re promised the house & now because I have bought it for my GD- My sis is essentially homeless. \n\nSo am I the a-hole for buying the house?", "created_utc": 1689381333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zx5ce/aita_for_buying_my_exs_family_home_to_give_it_away/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
