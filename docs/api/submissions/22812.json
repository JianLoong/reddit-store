We use Slack at the company.  \nThree weeks ago I got added to a new project with a User Research team. One of the members on that team is called Suzanne, and she's in the lead for that team and my SPOC (singe point of contact). I searched her on Slack to send her a few questions and noticed she had a profile picture of Suzy Bishop from Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom. In my company I think 95% of people either have a (semi-) professional picture of them as a profile picture, then 4.99999% have no picture and then you have the occasional person that has a profile picture of something nerdy (like the guy from Fallout or some anime thing) or in this case from a movie.  \nI thought it would be nice to acknowledge I know the movie, so instead of calling her Suzanne I address her by Suzy B and then asked the questions. She answers my questions, says nothing about the name whatsoever. Over the next few weeks every time I send her a question I address her by Suzy B, not to tease or to flirt but I just think it's funny.  \nYesterday there was a big meeting to talk about the progress, but nothing too formal. Note that in the Google Meet screen, she also has this profile picture of Suzy B. It's my turn to talk and I explain I've been working with Suzy B and made good progress.  \nThen Suzanne interrupts me and says \"You do know my name is Suzanne and not Suzy B right?\". I ask if that question is for me or for someone else, and she says it's for me. I tell her \"Of course I know\". \"Then why do you call me Suzy B?\". \"Because your profile picture is of Suzy B from Moonrise Kingdom, right?\".  \nIt's getting awkward by this point. I don't know why she chose this moment to talk about this. She never mentioned it once. Then she hit me with the \"Can you please keep this professional and address me by my real name?\".  \nBefore I could think twice I already blurted out \"Yeah right, nothing as professional as a 40 year old woman using the picture of a 12 year old girl from a movie about teenagers falling in love as a profile picture in a professional environment\". She just left the meeting after this, and by then it was really awkward. Luckily I was the last one to present the progress so we could close this meeting after that.  \nToday I got a meeting invite from my boss (who is on holiday right now) with someone for HR and like some VP or something for next week. Suzy B is not invited to the meeting. Talking with some friends and family about it, they all said my last response was not necessary, so I'm TA for that.  \nHowever if she decides to have a profile picture of a movie scene, she should expect people to talk about the movie with her and as she never said to call her by her real name, I'm not to be blamed.

You would have been NTA if you had said almost anything else in that moment.\n\nThe best option for you to have picked would be \"Understood. Sorry for the confusion.\"", "That sentence is too long for you to have said it in real life. And even if those aren't the exact words, I don't think you said that because all eyes would be on you. YTA obviously.", "YTA - you could talk to her *about* the movie but addressing someone by not their name in a professional setting makes you an AH. \n\nYou also did this during a meeting, so even less professional. Then your response to her really was the nail in the coffin here.", "YTA. If is introduced to you as Suzanne, you call her Suzanne. It does not matter what she has on her profile picture. Calling her Suzy in meetings does not sound like a friendly gesture as you suggested. A friendly gesture would be to have a chat about common interests when you see her. At a meeting enviroment, this sounds like a put down or a power move. More to the point, when she told you her preferences, instead of apologising (as you would do if you were actually trying to be friendly and sad that you upset her) you berate her in a professional enviroment, bringing her gender and age into the setting. \n\n>as she never said to call her by her real name\n\nThat is because she does not have to say that. Nobody does. That is assumed. If she called you Mr. Potatohead in meetings, you would not say \"I can't blame her, I never specified to only use my real name.\" That sounds crazy.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Today I got a meeting invite from my boss (who is on holiday right now) with someone for HR and like some VP or something for next week. Suzy B is not invited to the meeting.\" .. why would she be there for your reprimand?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour Boss AND HR, and \"and like some VP or something\" ... You can be glad if you manage to turn it around and not be fired. That's the classic constellation for that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Then she hit me with the \"Can you please keep this professional and address me by my real name?\".\" ... the ONLY reasonable answer here would have been \"Sorry. Yes, I will do that.\" .. you adress people by their name UNLESS explicitely invited to do otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: IF you care to keep the job, apologize, tell them you realize your actions were wrong, and promisse to do better. Or - if you don't care about the job - act like here.", "YTA\n\nYou clearly started doing this to take a dig at her perceived professionalism. And when she asked you to stop using the nickname, you went on a rant in front of the whole meeting insulting her instead of respecting her boundary.", "YTA\n\nJust because she has a profile picture of a character doesn't mean she actually wants to be called that character's name. \n\nYou didn't use her real name because you just didn't want to.", "YTA. Sure talk to her about the movie but calling her the character name makes no sense. She's clearly allowed to have that as her profile picture because it's not on her work id. At my job some people use pets, cartoon versions of themselves like a bitmoji, personal photos of them it's allowed as a profile picture. You were being an AH and you know it.", "YTA for sure. Maybe she was ok for you to adress her like this 1 on 1 but not in front of her colleagues.  OP is full of it when everybody says he's AH an he needs to post here.", "Wow, YTA.  It might have been funny one (maybe).  Calling her that in public is completely unprofessional.  Escalating it after she asked you to call her by her actual name is worthy of a trip to HR.", "YTA FFS\n\nJust because someone has a picture of a movie character DOES NOT mean they want to be confronted or engaged about it, it's just that they like the character or movie.\n\nAnd here's a lesson too, slick, if someone tells you to stop what you're doing to them because it's bothering them. YOU. STOP.\n\nDo you understand that? Can you follow a simple instruction to stop bothering someone?", "YTA. Once she asked you to use her real name the ***only*** appropriate response was \"Yes, of course.\"", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to comment on her choice of profile picture in the break room or casually but interacting in meetings or professional correspondence should be just that\u2026professional. And she probably didn\u2019t mention anything sooner because she probably figured you\u2019d drop the teasing but clearly you didn\u2019t.", "YTA I mean this is a mildly odd thing to do in general.  I call people by their handle occasionally, but I don't think I've run into anyone being called by their avatar's name.  That seems needlessly confusing at best.  Especially as it's something that can change quite a bit.  She clearly finally snapped.  Maybe she could have said this privately but you're explosion was grossly unprofessional.  She asked you to use her name, you personally insulted her in front of multiple people and were extremely unprofessional.", "It doesn't matter what her profile picture was.\n\nThe second a coworker asks you not to call them a nickname or likewise, your only response is, \"Of course, sorry about that.\" Or some variation on that.\n\nYou might be unaware of the fact that calling a coworker an unwanted nickname after they've asked you to stop is considered harassment.\n\nYTA", "ESH. When you sent her questions and called her Suzy B, the right thing for her to do would have been to correct you *then*, not in a public meeting. That was the wrong way for her to handle it. But, you\u2019re also just as much the AH. \n\nCalling someone \u201cSuzy B\u201d once was maybe funny, multiple times, annoying. When she didn\u2019t acknowledge the joke, THAT was your cue to stop. But you didn\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s also NOT YOUR JOB to decide what is and isn\u2019t appropriate for someone\u2019s profile picture.", "Of course YTA lmao. Call people by their names. \n \nMany people don\u2019t like the idea of having their own picture as their profile picture. Especially for work. My fianc\u00e9s company has as least 5 people that have nerdy incons instead of their own pictures. No one ever thought to call them by the characters names, because that\u2019s dumb.", "While I agree that she handled this terribly, I still think YTA kinda. As in, I don't think you responded appropriately to her asking you not to address her as that.   \nHowever YWNBTA had you just called her out in private after the fact. You could've totally high-grounded her in private.", "You were NTA up until the point she asked you to address her by her actual name. Your response to that made YTA.", "YTA, I\u2019ll give you a very slight pass for calling her that one on one via email/Google Meets but not for doing it in a meeting, even if not overly formal. It seems like that was the breaking point and she was done with it. Saying Suzy B when everyone else in the meeting calls her Suzanne is unprofessional.", "YTA\n\nA casual remark to her privately about the movie would have been okay, calling her \"Suzy B\" in a professional setting was not, I can't understand why you thought that was a good idea.\n\nAnd you, who wouldn't stop calling someone *not their name* in various professional settings have 0 things to say about someone else's professionalism.\nGrow up and start calling people by their actual names.", "Weirdly I think this is one of the first *light* ESH I've come across.\n\nShe probably should expect some level of engagement regarding the movie and her profile picture. I don't think she should have been as immediately confrontational and I don't think this was the right setting.\n\nWhere *you* went wrong is firstly in choosing to address her as Suzy B in person and in a meeting. And secondly, the final comment you made was indeed unnecessary and asshole-ish.\n\nAgain, neither of you is very much of an asshole, but I think both of you acted like slight assholes.", "ESH She chose to use the picture, if she doesn't like you calling her by that name, she should have told you before, or changed to a more professional picture. Your response was wrong though, and you made yourself look like a dick. If you'd kept quiet, or just said, \"sure, no problem.\" there might not be a meeting with HR.", "ESH\n\nIf you have a profile picture of someone, expect to be called by that character's name.\n\nYour last comment was a bit much.", "I feel like you\u2019re NTA. Why make that her profile pic and then be so confrontational about it? she could\u2019ve said something privately if it bothered her.

The AH questionable part would be the comment he made after the request.  Which to my mind isn't to insist that he still gets to call her the nickname, just surprise that it would be an issue given the picture.", "Not with that response he sure as hell couldn't have!", "I disagree. I think at work, especially as it sounds like a formal office job, nicknames should only be used after invited to. My full name has many natural nicknames that people will just call me without even asking, upon first meeting. (This is not my name) think shortening Roxanne to Roxy. Very annoying and most of the time people do NOT care that I prefer my full actual name. It's made worse by the fact that I also share a name with a character that's loved and I also happen to like.

He's TA.", "You can engage without purposefully calling someone the wrong name, which is a generally accepted no-no especially in the workplace.

Appropriate engagement would be something like \u201cI like that movie too\u201d or something of that nature. OP messed up from start to finish here.", "He called her name incorrectly publicly. Why should she address it privately? Calling anyone by anything but their correct name is never professional.", "No, he's still calling her that afterwards. \n\n> Suzy B is not invited to the meeting", "That's what I'm saying.

He could've easily called her out in private on choosing that moment to call him out in front of everyone", "Cuz it's not like you see your boss is named Richard and just decide to call him dick without him saying he goes by that right? So why is Suzanne and Suzy different?", "I agree! I'm just saying that he had no reason to believe it had been inappropriate, and I think the situation could have been handled in a better way. \n\nI forgot to add this clarification in my original comment, but OP is definitely *more* of an asshole than his coworker.", "If I had to put it up to a ranking I would say he was more of an asshole than her, but I stand by my judgement.\n\nHe was definitely an asshole, but I can't say she handled the situation very well either.", "Yep, I agree. My biggest issues with OP came from when he referred to her in-person that way onward. \n\nI definitely consider him more of an asshole.", "I see your point. I just feel like her setting that as her profile picture kind of set a precedent in my mind. Especially since it\u2019s a play on her own name and not a random thing. Maybe I\u2019m biased because I personally wouldn\u2019t have taken it offensively, and would\u2019ve enjoyed a funny acknowledgment of my picture. \n\nI think my feeling on him not being the asshole is a lot of the stuff preceding the harsh comment OP made in response to her addressing it in front of everyone.", "Yes, and what I'm saying is his response would have been wildly inappropriate and ceded the high ground even in private.", "Totally agree with what you're saying, but this is a bit different, at least in my mind. He was calling her by the name of the character she'd chosen as her photo. Not some random nickname he'd made up. Still a little iffy on professionalism, but not assholish IMO.", "In person shouldn\u2019t be a qualifier, he was wrong to miss-name her at all. Unless someone gives you permission to use another name you always use the name they present or introduce themselves as. Even in written communication.", "Right right. Yeah reading back what I wrote I see the confusion. I meant he wouldn't have been the AH had he moved on instead of handling how he did, and then proceeded to high ground her by calling her out in private. But dude was the AH cause of how he handled it instead"]}
