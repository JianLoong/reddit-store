We use Slack at the company.  \nThree weeks ago I got added to a new project with a User Research team. One of the members on that team is called Suzanne, and she's in the lead for that team and my SPOC (singe point of contact). I searched her on Slack to send her a few questions and noticed she had a profile picture of Suzy Bishop from Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom. In my company I think 95% of people either have a (semi-) professional picture of them as a profile picture, then 4.99999% have no picture and then you have the occasional person that has a profile picture of something nerdy (like the guy from Fallout or some anime thing) or in this case from a movie.  \nI thought it would be nice to acknowledge I know the movie, so instead of calling her Suzanne I address her by Suzy B and then asked the questions. She answers my questions, says nothing about the name whatsoever. Over the next few weeks every time I send her a question I address her by Suzy B, not to tease or to flirt but I just think it's funny.  \nYesterday there was a big meeting to talk about the progress, but nothing too formal. Note that in the Google Meet screen, she also has this profile picture of Suzy B. It's my turn to talk and I explain I've been working with Suzy B and made good progress.  \nThen Suzanne interrupts me and says \"You do know my name is Suzanne and not Suzy B right?\". I ask if that question is for me or for someone else, and she says it's for me. I tell her \"Of course I know\". \"Then why do you call me Suzy B?\". \"Because your profile picture is of Suzy B from Moonrise Kingdom, right?\".  \nIt's getting awkward by this point. I don't know why she chose this moment to talk about this. She never mentioned it once. Then she hit me with the \"Can you please keep this professional and address me by my real name?\".  \nBefore I could think twice I already blurted out \"Yeah right, nothing as professional as a 40 year old woman using the picture of a 12 year old girl from a movie about teenagers falling in love as a profile picture in a professional environment\". She just left the meeting after this, and by then it was really awkward. Luckily I was the last one to present the progress so we could close this meeting after that.  \nToday I got a meeting invite from my boss (who is on holiday right now) with someone for HR and like some VP or something for next week. Suzy B is not invited to the meeting. Talking with some friends and family about it, they all said my last response was not necessary, so I'm TA for that.  \nHowever if she decides to have a profile picture of a movie scene, she should expect people to talk about the movie with her and as she never said to call her by her real name, I'm not to be blamed.

Calling her Suzy in meetings does not sound like a friendly gesture as you suggested. A friendly gesture would be to have a chat about common interests when you see her. At a meeting enviroment, this sounds like a put down or a power move. More to the point, when she told you her preferences, instead of apologising (as you would do if you were actually trying to be friendly and sad that you upset her) you berate her in a professional enviroment, bringing her gender and age into the setting. \n\n>as she never said to call her by her real name\n\nThat is because she does not have to say that.

My full name has many natural nicknames that people will just call me without even asking, upon first meeting. (This is not my name) think shortening Roxanne to Roxy.

My biggest issues with OP came from when he referred to her in-person that way onward. \n\nI definitely consider him more of an asshole.", "I see your point.

Maybe I\u2019m biased because I personally wouldn\u2019t have taken it offensively, and would\u2019ve enjoyed a funny acknowledgment of my picture. \n\nI think my feeling on him not being the asshole is a lot of the stuff preceding the harsh comment OP made in response to her addressing it in front of everyone.", "Yes, and what I'm saying is his response would have been wildly inappropriate and ceded the high ground even in private.", "Totally agree with what you're saying, but this is a bit different, at least in my mind. He was calling her by the name of the character she'd chosen as her photo. Not some random nickname he'd made up. Still a little iffy on professionalism, but not assholish IMO.", "In person shouldn\u2019t be a qualifier, he was wrong to miss-name her at all. Unless someone gives you permission to use another name you always use the name they present or introduce themselves as. Even in written communication.", "Right right. Yeah reading back what I wrote I see the confusion.

Probably what happened is she thought you some weird person who repeatedly kept using this nickname you have given her, but she thought you wouldn\u2019t carry over into a meeting setting using this nickname. She assumed it was an individual chat thing.

I was looking at your profile picture and the character name slipped out.\"\n\nThen move on.\n\nYou don't tell someone they are unprofessional because they correct you.", "Seriously?  Is there really any question here?  YTA. First, you took it upon yourself to start using a different name for her.  She let it go since it was in strictly one-on-one communication.  Then you amplified it by calling her by your chosen nickname\u2026in a professional meeting with others.  It likely never occurred to her that you would do that.  And likely no one else at that meeting even made that connection.  The appropriate answer was \u201cof course, I apologize.\u201d  But no, you doubled down and brought up your unprofessional assumption that due to her profile picture, it was completely appropriate to call her by a fictional character\u2019s name.  She asked you to be professional in a professional setting\u2026and you exploded it with a pretty little tirade essentially calling her the one being unprofessional.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t talk about the movie with her.  You never talked about the movie with her.  You used an innocuous profile picture to forge some non-existent inside joke that you never established with her and then you used the movie as a sledgehammer to justify nicknaming a work colleague.
