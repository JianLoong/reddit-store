Also, everyone involved in this lives in the same house.\n\nA few months ago, I borrowed my sibling's car because mine had a busted head gasket and sputtered when I drove it. I did not feel safe to drive it and had to ask my sibling for permission to drive their car during the day (which is when they sleep because of their sleep apnea). I made the mistake of not asking about their schedule on a certain day and wasn't back when they needed the car. It led to a shouting match that ended in me not being able to use their car anymore, so I was forced to ask my mother to drive her car to and from work, which is about a 5 minute drive away. For context, I clock into work at 5am and this was the winter, so walking was not ideal in this situation but I was very ready to need to do so if necessary. \n\nA few weeks after this, I was walking down a flight of stairs at my 2nd job and I missed a step, causing me to land flat on the landing, which lead to a severe sprain in my right ankle. I was immobile for about a week and on crutches for almost 3. I made an appointment to go to Urgent Care and have xrays done to see what happened. My sibling was asked to pick me up and they were visibly annoyed when I got in the car, but I didn't say anything right away. It was only after a snarky comment that I asked what the problem was, which lead to an argument where I sat there and had them yell at me for the misunderstanding from before, which I tried to apologize for. Things got to the point where they stopped and tried to get me to get out and walk (on crutches) to the office of my 1st job so I could drop off the doctor's note, and then home (a 20 minute walk without the sprain). I asked them to at least drop me off at the office, which they answered by speeding down the narrow, one-way street to the building and kicking me out of the car and yelling \"walk\" to me before speeding away. \n\nNow, they've totaled their car after an accident that was their fault and I'm expected to play chauffeur for them, driving them to/from PT because they fucked up their back in the accident that was their fault, without having had a single apology directed towards me for abandoning me when I was vulnerable and needed help. I've refused to pick them up and now my family is telling me I just need to \"get over it\" because \"we're family\". All I want is a sincere apology. Am I asking too much? Am I an asshole?\n\nEdit:\nMy preface about identity had everything to do with my use of my sibling's preferred pronouns (they/them).

Your sibling sounds like they need to work on coping skills. This isn't how you treat any human. Especially family. They tried to use fear and intimidation against you.", "NTA. don\u2019t get the disclaimer in the beginning but i dirgress. you made an honest mistake and apologized and your sibling treated you like shit while you were in pain and in need of help. you deserve an apology from them", "NTA, \"All I want is a sincere apology\" Even if you get one, just tell them to walk.", "NTA\n\nAt a minimum they should apologize.", "I get why you're upset, I would be too.  Is this the hill you want to die on though?  Sometimes you have to be the \"bigger\" person.  If it were me, I'd let it ride a couple of months and then pay it back and leave them stranded just to be even, but that's just me.

Why would it even be remotely relevant?", "ESH - you and your entire family sound exhausting.", "ESH - This sounds like an exhausting relationship, most of which could be resolved by just talking to each other.\n\nYour sibling let you borrow their car, you should have found out when they needed back, that\u2019s common sense. They had every right to be annoyed And rescind the use of their car.\n\nBut not weeks later, when you had a legitimate need to be picked up.\n\nAnd they should have driven more carefully but again, they had a legitimate need to be picked up.\n\nI think you should both stop focussing on this game of getting your own back, as it sounds like it\u2019s making everyone needlessly miserable.\n\nAlso, why do you need to mention gender identity at the beginning here? It doesn\u2019t seem relevant.", "ESH. It sounds like classic sibling pettiness, not much more than that. \n\nWhat does concern me is that you start with this line \"I want to preface all of this by saying I have no prejudice against anyone for how they identify and this has nothing to do with personal identity of any kind.\" but your sibling's personal identity has absolutely nothing to do with the story. Are you sure you don't have any subconscious resentments or prejudices that may have influenced why your sibling treated you the way they did initially?", "ESH.  I think you *do* have a problem with how your sibling identifies, or you wouldn't have brought it up. It's irrelevant. That being said, you're right that after you apologized for the miscommunication, there was absolutely no reason for you to get dumped on the side of the road on crutches and a great distance from their destination. However, it's partly your fault for asking for a ride during your sibling's regular sleep hours. People get cranky when they are sleep deprived. And I see an awful lot of maternal interference going on, too. Would any of this have happened if Mom hadn't pressured OP's sibling into loaning OP the car in the first place? Maybe they didn't even want to loan the car, and then it wasn't there when they needed it. That would definitely explain the outrage when OP finally brought it back!", "ESH. I suspect you wish you belonged to a different family, and your family wishes it as well.", "INFO: \n\nWhat exactly did they miss when you didn't bring back the car on time?\n\n\n\nWhy exactly did they kick you out of the car that day? \n\n>Things got to the point where they stopped and tried to get me to get out and walk\n\nIs pretty vague.", "ESH. I'm kind of wondering why you even brought this up\n\n>I want to preface all of this by saying I have no prejudice against anyone for how they identify and this has nothing to do with personal identity of any kind. Also, everyone involved in this lives in the same house.\n\nit really has nothing to do w/ the story besides the fact that you use they/them pronouns for your sibling, kinda feels like there may be something more going on there, but anyways.\n\nYour sibling was def in the wrong for treating you that way and shouldn't have abandoned you to walk w/ a sprained ankle, that being said, a sprained ankle is VERY different from an injury resulting from a car accident that requires PT to recover, you should probably help out even if they were an AH to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
