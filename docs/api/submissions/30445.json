I text back, \"Hey, is that the right amount? Can we do a google sheet and have people sign up to bring specific items?\" My friend said \u201cI already bought everything, but if you can't afford it right now, just venmo what you can.\"\r  \nI thought that was a rude way to say it, but maybe I should've handled it differently. I venmo'd her the $50. The party was fun, even tho my gf could basically only eat crackers. We brought wine and so did some other friends and we all shared with everyone. At the end of the night, we were all helping my friend clean up, and she mentioned that she thought we would eat more and she had basically as much meat and cheese as she put out left over.\r  \nSo I asked if we could all bring some home, since we all paid for it. She looked kind of surprised and said she was thinking about hosting another charcuterie night for all of us.

The host sounds like she's making a tidy profit on these charcuterie nights, no wonder she's keen to do another. Personally, if I invite guests round to my home for food, I don't ask for money and I usually send them home with a tupperware of leftovers. I also say no need to bring gifts but a bottle of wine or chocolates is appreciated, although I wouldn't think bad if they didn't. Totally understandable if you're friend can't afford to pay for everyone, but in that case she should have done a pot luck so that people can contribute things they can afford and what they can eat, not be forced to eat what she dictates, pay what she says without question and her get her fridge stocked for free for the next week with all the leftovers.

Go to a restaurant then!\n\n25 bucks for a charcuterie where you had to take the drinks yourself? Also, a party where you know you gonna have a vegan person and yet dont buy anything for her, despite she paying her share? \n\nYou were absolutly right. The food was there, paid for all of you. This so called friend should be the first to offer. She didnt want to host another party for you. She would save that for herself and other people or maybe even another party for other people.\n\nNext time someone wanna do a party like this, offer the \"each person takes some food\" deal. If they keep with this charade, ask them to see the grocerie list to understand the 25 bucks a person. Honestly, I wouldnt go. I would take my 25 and go eat out and better.\n\nAlso, tell your girlfriend, the host gets to keep the lefhovers when he pays for it!

Host usually keeps leftovers because they paid/made it.\nThey didn't pay so why should they keep it.", "NTA. However, my experience about food party leftovers has varied greatly by region, and by group. In Montana, potluck guests would leave any leftovers with the host (and you'd have to chase them down in the next couple of weeks to return their casserole dish). In New York, potluck guests would take their leftovers home. In Texas, the hostess will pack up \"a plate\" from all the leftovers for you to take home like a whole extra meal.\n\n\nI guess the answer is to find a friend group that agrees to how leftovers will be treated.\n\n\nIn any case, charging your guests a food fee to attend a party is crude. It changes the relationship from host/guest to organizer/attendees.", "NTA. The host normally keeps leftovers because the host pays for it and cooks it. If y'all paid for the meal, it's YOURS to take home. Also, the host frequently sends people home with food anyway because it's difficult for one person or a small family to eat that much food before it goes bad. And you're right, you'd have to have that 2nd party pretty darn soon if you're gonna do it before the food spoils.", "NTA. Sounds like they were just trying to get free food out of y'all", "NTA at all. The host bought nothing more than anybody else did. You all bought your own food. It would be right for you all to take your food with you.", "NAH.\n\nThey took too much money for food, and you were just asking if you could resolve it THIS way.  The host had another idea - fair enough, but I hope the host will have the party soon and reimburse people somehow if they're not able to come to the second party.  Personally, I like the idea of taking home leftovers.  \n\nI think your girlfriend was overreacting on the issue of you asking.  But I gotta admire that she was willing as a vegan to go to this party and chip in the full share for food.  Good sport!", "\\>  >  If I\u2019m the asshole, **I\u2019ll apologize** to my friend in the group chat.\n\nI don't think it's to that level of cringe. NAH\n\nI was raised that a guest never asks to bring food home, including if they brought the food. It's the host's to keep. Part of a thank you for hosting. What they decide to do with it is up to them. Guests can hint if they really want to, but not press it.\n\nI was told this as a teen when I didn't know better and noticed the really good thing I brought was barely touched...and we didn't have much in the pantry...so I my teen self thought: hey, I can ask for that and have some for breakfast! That's when the hostess gently told me etiquette says don't ask. Okay with me.\n\nI see your point about paying $25 each ($50 total) for a charcuterie party when your gf can't eat much. But you did *opt to go to it knowing that*. I understand because as a vegetarian, I often cannot eat the most expensive stuff, if it's a 'meat main' at a prix fixe, or something like that -- but that is just how it is at times. I can choose to partake or not to partake...In this case a meat and cheese party, unless they provided, or you brought, vegan cheese and vegan sausage and pepperoni (which exist, for any reading), then you knew up front, you can't eat much there. If they didn't work that out with you both ahead of time, and asked $25 per, and you accepted, then that's the deal.\n\nIf the hostess knew that (your gf is vegan and couldn't eat much but crackers), maybe she didn't want to second guess your decision, or thought you might bring something with (a lot of people with special dietary needs do that habitually.) The part when she said \"if you can't afford it,\" I think she was being kind or understanding, to offer to 'just pay what you can.' Read it as 'pay what you want' if you prefer. I don't think she meant it insultingly. She was being a generous host.\n\nIf you go back for the next charcuterie night, maybe bring some vegan approximations? Or ask if she can supply some, and send her links of examples, maybe?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then, maybe, eat $30-40 worth instead (yourself), if you are concerned about getting your total $50 money's worth in food alone (because as you describe it, your gf is eating about $5 worth in food.

We usually did \u201ceveryone chips in\u201d or potluck style to help spread the burden of having a party around, but that was because it was only a few friends with the space/setup to host. \n\nIt meant more hangouts, more good food, BUT we always made sure if someone had food restrictions or didn\u2019t drink that they didn\u2019t overpay/had options. \n\nIn a new area now and we threw a small party for my birthday and I specifically didn\u2019t ask anyone to pitch in- I think we were left with more alcohol in our fridge than we began with and one friend basically shoved cash at us that covered the pizza. \n\nThere are really two issues here with OP\u2019s experience- host didn\u2019t provide some options for the GF but expected the money from her, and the host didn\u2019t offer to share leftovers when the partygoers paid for the food.", "Hell, I've never thrown a party where I don't send people home with to-go boxes, and I've NEVER charged anyone to be a GUEST in my home!\n\nIt's lovely to throw a pot luck, or when people are kind enough to volunteer to bring something, but regardless, everyone goes home with at least a snack.", "Even when I don't have to pay to be at the party the host usually is shoving food at people as they're leaving, like \"please take this with you, I don't know what I would do with all this food!\"", "I would *never* charge people to come to my party and I'm still forever begging everyone to take the leftovers. I literally buy a bulk pack of takeaway containers specifically for this reason", "Hell, I've been to both hosted and potluck style parties where everyone takes some stuff home because who wants a fridge full of random party food? Without having to pay for it, no less....", "When I threw my birthday party earlier this year, I spent about $600 for food. I forced people to take food home cause there was so much left and I didn\u2019t want it to go to waste.", "I would add that a good host would have suggested that his gf is more than welcome to bring something that meets her dietary needs.. that and not charge folks.\n\nWould've been better if every pair brought a board of different things", "Agreed. Reminds me of a lady in our friend circle who used to throw birthday parties for her kids and when you would RSVP that you were going to attend she would hit you with \"oh great! It's a pot luck you can bring a sidedish.\"", "True.  A good host asks guests if they'd like to take anything on their way out.   \n\nI will admit when my kids had bday parties, we'd offer the food but wouldn't really suggest guests took the leftover cupcakes.", "The food won't be wasted, it's cured! \ud83d\ude0b The host may enjoy it with a nice glass of wine, all week. \ud83d\ude09\ud83c\udf77", "Seriously, you're right.  Cut up cheese and thinly sliced bread and meat dry out fast in the fridge . I know , I had tons of salami roses at a family  gathering.  No one took it home . I was bummed because  I wasted a lot of food . Well , feed it to the javalinas  in my backyard .", "Did you do CoBUMbo??", "I hope it was fragrant", "NTA dont pay anymore or dont go.... friend got free money and a free food...  I'm sure there were left over wine the friend kept...\nMost people I know will make 3 or 4 plates to go....\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think the host was turning a profit. 25 bucks a head and they brought their own drinks?", "Nah, it's the charge itself not the amount that is the main problem for me. It's like getting your dick out at a baptism. The ritual is ruined and there's one thing people will be talking about after.\n\nRemember, going to a party, I only gotta turn up with a bottle of wine. What money needs to be saved on my part? If you can't afford the party, don't throw it. Nobody minds, it's not on the calendar before you mention it!\n\nThe party economy is sort of like the buying-drinks-in-rounds economy imo -- you don't get to set the terms of how the outlay comes back to you. (It's not quite like that cos if you've got a buddy who never buys a round, stop buying him a drink... whereas you might like throwing parties when plenty don't... it's just one of those nebulous social things where the benefits are maybe intangible...)", "If you wanna host a party, host one. Asking people to bring their own alcohol is ok, because people all have different tastes and it can be hard to cater for. Although for a charcuterie party the host should provide some wine. Even suggesting that everyone bring a contribution to the charcuterie platter is ok. Even specifically requesting contributions is ok (Alice, can you bring prosciutto and Fred can you bring Brie).\n\nBut asking people for MONEY is just crazy. As soon as you bring money into it, you've turned a social event into a transaction, so now people are wondering if they got their money's worth. That's not how you host a good evening with friends.\n\nThe host should have offered leftovers anyway (honestly, how much charcuterie can a person eat?). People who come to my home for dinner go away with all sorts of items in takeaway containers. I always have too much food :)", "This feels like a natural progression for which I don't think my no-charges-for-parties rule applies. If it's the same group hanging out, it feels more explicitly like the rounds system in pubs where somebody welching all the time becomes obvious. Sounds like OP is dealing with a more hey-let's-have-a-party situation that is not \"on the books\" in the same way as yours", "This still ruins it  \n\nPeople get stuck with stuff after parties, this is always a possible consequence  \n\nMoney exchange should not be a feature of parties. If you need one you've planned it wrong or have proverbial balls which are too small  \n\nWho the heck has a problem with being stuck with tons of cheese anyway", "Crappy host to not share leftovers . Slices of cheese and meats go stale fast . I had way too much at my last party and no one wanted leftovers . Learned to make some beautiful  salami  roses though !!:", "\u00a320 will get you a charcuterie board at a restaurant, $25 dollars per person for DIY at someone's house is extortionate", "Yeah. For that price, my guests would be taking home a very nice goody bag along with any leftovers they'd want.", "Absolutely  , I guess op wasn't taught proper etiquette  . Just common sense manners for a gracious  host . And she didn't have to pay a freaking penny . What a b.", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf facts !!!", "\"Come on man you HAVE to come to my party\" \n\n\"No, I didn't enjoy the last one.\" Lol", "Oh lord .", "Weird for sure . Never heard of anything  like that in my life . Probably  the same people who have a destination wedding  and expect  you to fork out your tickets, hotel and meals .", "Though you wouldn't suggest it, did you say no if they asked for any of them?", "I absolutely add lots of veggies and fruit to my board . It gives it color !", "Not if you go to Costco  and buy in bulk . Specialty cheeses and meats are in bulk and cheep . She flat out scared these people  imo.", "A faucet and cups, loooool. You're lucky she didn't charge for that, too.", "She made money and got free food for at least a week. Maybe a month if she froze it.", "Nothing, I would like some leftover cheese right now! But I have work early. Sweet cheese dreams \ud83d\ude18", "And if she bought  the stuff and made them herself  she made out like a bandit . Cheeses ,  meats and bread go a long way .", "I do sometimes grab a mouthful of cheese on the way to bed. I know my body won't thank me skipping the digestive downtime but I want them wild cheese dreams", "That's what I was thinking!! Maybe she got super expensive stuff", "It seems like a lot until you figure, say, 8 people attend. $200 to buy gourmet things for a charcuterie board is not that outrageous", "Veges and fruits are a must on boards.  And if she went to Costco  she could get all the rare cheese and meats at a bulk discount  and good quality  . She scammed everyone and is laughing all the way to the bank . Every gracious  host knows to let the guests take home a plate of goodies . I'm sorry your wife didn't get veggies .", "Yeah, I was thinking that. If there is a vegan attending who has paid $25, cater for them.Get some hummus, babaganoush, olives, crudit\u00e9s, falafels etc. Other people will likely enjoy it too, and it means the vegan guest gets to eat."]}
