My mum and dad split up when I was 10-11. I loved my dad, wasn\u2019t the nicest person ever but he was enough and I loved him. After they split, he became very distant with me. He just stopped caring. He couldn\u2019t see past his and mums relationship but it was cruel to let that dictate our relationship. I was very ill with my mental health as a young teen and I desperately needed his support and all he did was say I was lying or say it was mums fault. \nHe got a new girlfriend and then just became fully distant. Never messaged or called and would flake on plans if we even had any. \nHis new girlfriend is very jealous of my mum and that caused more problems. \n2019 summer was the last time I saw him until August 2022. He promised to make plans when he was off work and message me the day after I\u2019d seen him. As it was always me reaching out to him, I waited. And there was nothing. Stereo silence, until June this year. My mum called me to let me know that my dad got married. She had found out on another social media and wanted to let me know before I found out another way. I was heartbroken. So now I had step siblings and a step mum and he had started a whole new family, without me. \nI was so angry, so I posted on my socials shaming him. I have sat and wondered what is wrong with me and why doesn\u2019t my dad want me for too many years. He tried to call me twice, I didn\u2019t answer cuz I was so angry and hurt. I tried to call him back after an hour. He never picked up. I miss him so much. I feel guilty but why should I? I have never hurt him and all he has ever done is crush me and my dreams", "created_utc": 1699629419, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17s6582/aita_for_publicly_shaming_my_dad_for_not_inviting/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having sperm that can crack an egg doesn't make you a father. I'm sorry you didn't get the father you needed, wanted and deserved. But realize he will also never be that for you. Grieve what you should have had, make peace with the fact that what you did get isn't worth your time, trouble, love, anything, and make your life an awesome one. NTA.", "I know this is advice you don't want to hear, but please put it out of your life and thoughts.\n\n The anger you feel because he decided in the middle of your childhood that he no longer wanted to be a parent is absolutely justified. Hell, my dad died and I still catch myself at times being angry because he's not here. \n\nThe thing is that he will not change his attitude because you are angry with him. If it bothered him, he would never leave you. Every child deserves parental love and he is one big asshole. At the end of the day, the only person who suffers is you, and the best thing for you is to suffer as little as possible because you don't deserve it. If he doesn't want to be a dad, don't hurt yourself further by trying to force him to be a dad.", "NTA. I just want to give you a virtual hug. You didn't cause any of this. I'm sorry your Dad isn't a nicer person.", "That all sounds very inconsiderate of him. May I ask does he now have step kids with this new wife? How old are they? Where they invited to the wedding, and did they go? \n  You have painted a picture of an inconsiderate dad..perhaps while staying as calm as possible (so you get the most honest explanation), ask him why he didn\u2019t invite you. Maybe tell him how you feel about all the things you mentioned in your post (again, try and stay calm, people \u2018hear\u2019 better that way). He either doesn\u2019t know how much what he does hurts you or doesn\u2019t care much.", "NTA however YWBTA  to yourself if you continue trying to have a relationship with him when he clearly doesn't care", "Generally, it\u2019s not a great idea to do things publicly because it\u2019s near impossible to present an accurate and unbiased point of view. I\u2019m sorry your dad has really let you down. We don\u2019t get to chose our family, so sometimes it turns out they aren\u2019t the best people to be in our lives. I\u2019ve had to go NC with very close family members because they brought nothing but pain and were incapable of showing any kind of consideration. It was painful for a long time and I essentially mourned their loss, but it did get better and my life was better for having let them go.", "So sorry, my Dear.  Some people are just AHs and your dad is one of them.  Big time.  Please get some counseling and live your life to the fullest.  Sending hugs.", "Your dad is a dick.\n\nWaste no more tears on him\n\n>I have sat and wondered what is wrong with me \n\nNothing is wrong with you. Everything is wrong with him.\n\nBlock and NC...  live your own life...", "NTA;  Your dad has effectively abandoned you since 11 without giving you the closure of slamming the door in your face.", "NTA...He should be held accountable for his behaviour.  You deserve better. Please seek the help and support you need.", "NTA. Some people are just shitty parents. It has nothing to do with you and everything to do with your dad. \n\nAt some point, you need to just cut your losses and accept you got one shitty parent. Hopefully, your mom is a good parent and you can focus on your relationship with her.", "NTA, and frankly, you should move on from him. He's clearly not interested in a relationship, and you're really just hurting yourself by trying to reach out.", "NTA- And if he cries to say he hurt by what you did.\n\nYou are hurt by the fact he's only reaching out because you publicly shamed him.\n\nAnd it's not that you publicly shamed him.\n\nYou shared your truth.  From all the lack of parenting he has done, what do you owe him that you wouldn't own a sperm donor?\n\nI talked to a therapist about that about speaking out about things that had happened to me and my family.\n\nBoth her and my children's disabilities caseworker told me separately) that you do not owe people your silence.  You get to live your truth.  And you're allowed to talk about your experience.", "nta but trust when I say down the road, he will call you and ask for a favor or whatever. Turn him away when this happens. \n\nConsider this closure. He acts like you don't exist so return the favor", "NTA. I still dont have kids of my own yet, but i cannot imagine not loving my children just because there is a falling out btwn me and my partner. The children dont deserved to be unloved. Despite all of these, u kept putting in the effort to your own dad, when i feel it should have been the other way around.\nYou have done more than what i think is your part, and it takes 2 hands to clap. \n\nI agree with u/TheLadyEve tho that hanging your dirty laundry on social media is never a good idea", "NTA but that wasn't the way to deal with it. I would have called him directly, don't hang your dirty sheets in public (even though he did...but be the bigger person).", "ESH - your dad sounds like a jerk, but no reason to post about it on social media. If you can\u2019t get through to him and it bothers you, see a therapist. Not all parents are good parents, but it\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault.", "Sorry but ESH \n\nHe's obviously a horrible parent. Nuff said. \n\nYou responded like a child.

I have tried to tell him calmly and angrily how much he hurts me but he just isn\u2019t willing to change.", "It was an act out of rebellion and anger. A lot of people tended to think he was a great guy and I guess I wanted to prove a point. But I do wish I didn\u2019t post and just nailed down on him over the phone.", "Glad to see im not the only one who feels this way. OP's response was childish. Tell him off over the phone at lease. Why want to attend a wedding of an absent parent anyways?", "Its just the nail in the coffin proving he doesn't care about OP.\n\nI dont think this was that big a deal. If he was upset people knew he excluded his kid? He shouldn't have excluded his kid then.", "I think we need to go full blanket fort and hamster pile for this one, gang", "Hmmm\u2026? You should ask if they were invited and if they went for clarification. Did he give you a reason/response to why he didn\u2019t tell you or invite you? One last quick question, would you have gone/enjoyed being there?", "Idk about this. I'm against airing personal business on social media too, but .... abandonment DESERVES a public call out IMO. You are NTA", "If I ever speak to him maybe I will ask these questions. I feel like I would have been happy to be there. Because I do not hate my dad, the problem is that I miss him and love him even tho he is an AH.", "You miss the idea of him and are not able able to see who he actually is. He's been showing you who he is for years. I know you want things to be different, but it's not going to. Please attend therapy and learn to let him go. You'll feel much better. You still have your mom. And you can have your own family with friends and such. Let him go. NTA I'm sorry he's so awful to you. Doesn't seem like he's ever going to change.", "Well, maybe his step kids weren\u2019t invited and it was a small low key event\u2026then later the adult step kids told their mom they wanted to have a little celebration for her. Here\u2019s the thing, those adult children of hers will most likely always go through her for a channel of communication and not your dad (your dad never raised them). And as adults (late twenties) they probably have an open and mature line of communication with her, thereby making it easier for them and her to work things like this out. I know I\u2019m making a lot of assumptions here and I\u2019m not trying to be an AH. But think it could be a useful exercise to look at all the different point of views in order to find a better understanding of the situation. Well, bottom line, you need to have an open and honest conversation with your dad. He can\u2019t change what he\u2019s done and you can\u2019t change the way you feel, but you can both change the future of your relationship together. Best of luck.", "Or, maybe he's continuing his neglectful behavior. Don't make excuses for shitty parents. It's patronizing and insulting. Ignoring his track record of neglect isn't helping op at all.", "Neglect is when you don\u2019t look after your Child. How is this neglect. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s a good parent or a bad one, but I\u2019m not sure if the word neglect is the proper term to be used here.", "If anything, he\u2019s being an overprotective father, what they call a helicopter parent"]}
