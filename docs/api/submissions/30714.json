Hell, my dad died and I still catch myself at times being angry because he's not here. \n\nThe thing is that he will not change his attitude because you are angry with him. If it bothered him, he would never leave you. Every child deserves parental love and he is one big asshole. At the end of the day, the only person who suffers is you, and the best thing for you is to suffer as little as possible because you don't deserve it.

Where they invited to the wedding, and did they go? \n  You have painted a picture of an inconsiderate dad..perhaps while staying as calm as possible (so you get the most honest explanation), ask him why he didn\u2019t invite you. Maybe tell him how you feel about all the things you mentioned in your post (again, try and stay calm, people \u2018hear\u2019 better that way).

I\u2019ve had to go NC with very close family members because they brought nothing but pain and were incapable of showing any kind of consideration.

It has nothing to do with you and everything to do with your dad. \n\nAt some point, you need to just cut your losses and accept you got one shitty parent.

Here\u2019s the thing, those adult children of hers will most likely always go through her for a channel of communication and not your dad (your dad never raised them). And as adults (late twenties) they probably have an open and mature line of communication with her, thereby making it easier for them and her to work things like this out. I know I\u2019m making a lot of assumptions here and I\u2019m not trying to be an AH. But think it could be a useful exercise to look at all the different point of views in order to find a better understanding of the situation. Well, bottom line, you need to have an open and honest conversation with your dad. He can\u2019t change what he\u2019s done and you can\u2019t change the way you feel, but you can both change the future of your relationship together.

He only calls every few months and, likewise, I found out he got married through my mother who found out on social media. You have every right to be upset and angry, however my advice would be not to waste the energy in him. He doesn't care about you so you shouldn't care about him. Put that time, energy and effort onto something or someone(s) who are worth it and will return it. It might take time and it will hurt, but you'll be better for it.

No concept at all of how they should behave when they love someone, an inability to keep up the ruse of being a competent human being for longer than a few years at a time, or a total lack of the kind of self awareness it takes to put actual effort into your relationships. When those people become parents, particularly divorced parents, the kids become their collateral damage. It sucks and is deeply unfair, because you\u2019re left holding his baggage. \n\nPutting him on blast wasn\u2019t a great look for you, tbh.

My husband, by then was an adult and he straight up asked his dad if he hadn't been dying would he have contacted him and his dad said no. That was it for my husband and he decided that he would never let that poor excuse for a human being to have any affect on his life or mentality again. My husband was in his 40s by that time and had allowed those same thoughts (why am I not good enough, why can't he love me) haunt him for way too many years.  You are young! Do not let that man take up anymore space in your head. Stay close to the people who truly love you! People like him are just not worth it.", "NTA. \n\nYou don't deserve this, and you especially shouldn't feel guilty about anything. You did nothing wrong. Your dad has shown you that he doesn't care, so why should you give him the time of day anymore?\n\nMy only recommendation is for you to get counseling if you don\u2019t already.

But NTA you deserve better and now that you\u2019ve said how you feel you should take space from him and either he\u2019ll contact you or he want and you\u2019ll have your answer that you should try to move on. I\u2019m sure it might be hard to believe but him doing this has nothing to do with your value as a person. You are worthy of love and of someone showing up for you.

Recognize,  anyone that can behave so terribly to their own child is likely simply messed up at the core and it's has nothing to do with you, your character or who you are. They're just not good. It sucks but like someone said, you should seek counseling or research ways to grieve in a healthy manner. You haven't lost out on anything except you'll look back and see that for a period of time in your life you let someone make you doubt if you deserved their love when it's them that doesn't deserve yours.
