Isn't that the point of hiring, to not have to do that for a while? It's less of a sacrifice when you get a chance to know the person, but sacrificing for new strangers is never fun.\n\nNAH maybe. She's not wrong to look for better benefits, she's just going to have a really hard time finding anything at this stage for exactly the reasons you didn't hire her.", "there are so many people who do not understand how the law works here, good lord.\n\nNAH. your job is to make decisions for your business, you presumably chose a candidate who was better suited for the position advertised. If your business needs someone to come alleviate workload right now, hiring someone who will need to take an extended absence makes no sense. Technically, her pregnancy isn't the reason you didn't hire her, it's her availability. Think about it this way: if someone came into the interview and said \"I'd really like this job, but I have a three month long vacation planned in a month that I'm not willing to move or reschedule- can you accommodate that?\" the answer would have been no, and you wouldn't have hired them. \n\nThe only way you can get into legal trouble in this situation is if you emailed the candidate afterwards and said \"I didn't hire you because you're pregnant.\" Don't do that, and you're in the clear. This should be pretty easy, because that's not the reason you didn't hire her.", "NTA - Not sure what the legalities are but I'm not sure why employers are expected to hire people who knowingly can't work after 1 month.\n\nThe whole point of hiring someone is to help with additional work load.", "NTA. \n\nSomeone I met was pregnant, and applied for a semester-long posting at a school, to fill in for a lady who was also pregnant and planning to go on maternity leave. Both of them were due at almost the same exact time. Unsurprisingly this applicant didn't get the position. I remember asking her \"why on earth would you apply for a position that is literally to fill in for someone else having a baby too?\"\n\nObviously the school must have factored in the clear cut practicality of hiring someone needing maternity leave to fill in for someone going on maternity leave.", "lol these comments are a joke. so what OP just hires the pregnant woman so he doesn\u2019t get in trouble and ends up having to hire another person to replace her when she leaves in a few months?\n\nget a grip people", "Its not practical for you and your other employees because you would need to hire someone else to replace her during her maternity leave or your other employees would have to work more to cover her so NTA. \n\nEDIT: many comments says it\u2019s illegal but the post is not about what\u2019s legal or what\u2019s not it\u2019s about if it\u2019s a AH move and even if it\u2019s illegal, this is not being a AH", "NTA. I don't know the legalities where you are, but literally every place I've worked that offered anything in terms of maternity leave only did so after working for them for a year, specifically so that nobody could get hired just \"for the benefits,\" so-to-speak", "Definitely NTA.

Makes no sense to hire someone that is gone immediately.\nBut choose your words wisely for the refusal and dont add the pregnancy.", "NTA.  The purpose of your business is to provide logistics, not to provide people with jobs.  It makes no sense to hire someone who is only going to go on leave in a few weeks, and have to replace them with a temp.   Waste of your time.\n\nAlso sounds like you dodged a bullet as she'd be complaining every time things didn't go exactly her way with regard to going on leave.  IMHO that she's a single job is not a good sign of her judgment and planning skills either.  \n\n\nI'm sure this will be downvoted to oblivion, but facts are facts and they don't care about your feelings.", "NTA\n\n You run a bussiness, not a charity association. Your sister is the s****d asshole.", "NTA I don't know why pregnant women apply for jobs they can't be do.", "NTA.  Legality of your hiring decision could be called into question, but her motives were clearly to abuse your company for benefits.  She wants to start in a month?  Just in time for benefits to kick in and her to take leave, putting your company without the position being filled and being financially on the hook for her benefits?  Yeah, I don't think so.", "NTA  ... she literally wouldn't be able to do the job for at least 3 mths... it sucks for the woman, but if there was a person better qualified, then you go with the better candidate", "NTA, you didn't hire her because her availability doesn't fit your immediate needs, and you found a history of her bashing her previous employers online.", "It sounds like she was more concerned with her own welfare than the employers business interests, so NTA. While in reality everyone is self interested to various degrees, telegraphing it at a job interview while visibly pregnant is the height of arrogance. What chutzpah ,while also posting on social media.", "You say that you thought it odd she asked so many questions about benefits. Why? Do men not ask questions about compensation and benefits? Of course they do. You also know that she was interviewing you just as much as you were interviewing her - which is not unusual. So, you knew not to ask about the pregnancy, liked her responses until she asked questions about benefits (including but not limited to maternity), and decided to go investigate her social media to justify your hunch. I get it, I've done it myself, but only when something doesn't line up with the resume in my hand. She was a qualified candidate, but you already made up your mind as soon as she walked in the door. Depending on which state you're located, you could have just admitted to breaking the law.\n\nHowever, I do understand business decisions need to be made. To make those, more information is needed: how long is maternity leave, is there an extension to it, is there an option to do flex time remotely while on maternity leave, can the start date be pushed to after the maternity leave ends? Some companies make you use any vacation and sick time because they don't offer any sort of maternity benefits. Other companies offer up to 12 weeks. A few have started with flex time during a portion of the leave. So, I guess it depends quite a bit on all factors not just her working for one month and then gone for months.\n\nESH. You for the reasons mentioned above, and her for airing her opinions of her previous boss on social media.", "Lol everyone saying you\u2019re NTA as if you didn\u2019t just break the law.", "Nta, not sure of the legality behind it where you are but what\u2019s the point of hiring someone that\u2019s going to disappear in a month, it makes no sense. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d even get much benefits after being employed only a month anyway", "maybe, other places probably won\u2019t hire her for the same reason as you. this could possibly leave her without a job during this time (let\u2019s hope not) but hiring her means extra work for others.", "Nta there's another candidates", "Honestly, NTA in my book. Legally? Eh, don\u2019t catch yourself admitting it and you\u2019re fine. It sounds to me like she is getting a job just to get the maternity benefits for as long as possible then will quit when it\u2019s over. You gave her a chance and didn\u2019t choose her because she wouldn\u2019t be able to fulfill the duties required.", "NAH. Both you and the candidate try to do best for yourself and unfortunately the best for one is not the best for the other.", "NTA, it would seem she was more interested in what she could get out of you than what she could contribute to your company. You dodged one", "So you committed discrimination and outted yourself on Reddit? Better call Saul\n\n*Edit - YTA*", "I guess you already know it's against the law as I saw that you didn't mention anything about her pregnancy during the interview and only found out by going online.\n\nAt the same time, I can empathize with why you did it.

So 3 months we trained her, paid her, just for her to bring life in this world and get paid further for doing so.
