He gets out of school early on Wednesdays and we often encourage him to get his laundry started on Sundays (usually he would rather wait and get it started on Monday). The only rule we have when it comes to these chores is if they aren't done by the end of the day that they're supposed to be, the next day he has to stay in his room until the task is done. He still gets to go to sports practices, but other than that we don't do anything extra like watch a movie or go to the park until he gets these things done. For the record, when he actually puts effort in and buckles down and does it, neither of these things take him very long. The exception of course is when he is actively stalling. \n\nAnyway, his mom called and wanted to watch a movie with him tonight (she lives a few states away so this would be a virtual thing where they are basically both putting the same movie on at the same time.) We said they can watch a movie after dinner if he gets his laundry finished when he gets home from school (he spent all night last night actively avoiding getting it done.) She got upset because she has plans later tonight so the only time she can do it is right after school. We said she could call and talk to him while he works on his laundry, but he couldn't do a movie unless his chores were done. She asked if they could do it tomorrow instead and my husband said thats fine as long as he gets his room cleaned first. \n\nShe got upset and said that it's ridiculous that we are even expecting a seven year old to do his own laundry and clean his own room and that we should \"let him have fun and be a kid.\" She also said it's not fair that we are \"stopping them from spending time together.\" For the record, we have tried to set up regular times for them to do things like this together, but after a couple of weeks she will stop doing the scheduled calls. Sometimes she goes a few weeks without any contact at all. This is one of those instances when she hasn't been in contact for weeks and now all the sudden she wants to do something with him right now. They don't even talk during a movie, so really him talking to her in the phone while he does his chores would actually give them more bonding time.\n\nAre we wrong for expecting our seven year old to do his chores before doing extra \"fun\" activities during the week, even if they are with his mom?\n\nEdited to add (copied this from my response to a comment asking for more info):\n\nWe help him load the washer/dryer and all of that. Then it's his responsibility to take the clothes out of the dryer and put them away. He has to fold his pants and hang up the shirts (we have a low bar in his closet that he can easily reach). Every second or third time he puts his clothes away we will help him just to make sure things are staying organized and not getting out of control. \n\nPicking up his room is basically just putting his toys away and taking any empty water cups out. Every month or so we go through it together to help make sure things are staying organized.\n\nEdit 2: he only does his own laundry, not ours.

You're only using the stick.   So at the same time as providing no incentive you're also removing pretty normal activities that aren't treats as much as simple family time.   \n\nIt doesn't sit right, either, that you say laundry day is to the end of the day on Monday but you actually expect it done on Sunday.   \n\nSecondly, time with his bio mom is never a negotiating point.   Never.  Sure she's unreliable and not a good parent by the sounds,  but she's not putting the kid in danger or hurting him and you've no right to get in the way of their relationship.  How do you think that will work out in the future if you continue to insist bio mom is second or third or last?  Can you not see that you could well breed enough resentment that kiddo rejects you and turns to her?   \n\nSo YTA.  Kiddo needs flexibility.   He needs rewards for behaviour you wish to reinforce.   His family time, and bio mom time,  is a priority and not a punishment.", "INFO What does doing the laundry and cleaning his room entail? What do you expect him to do (for the washing: just sorting and folding or also actually washing and drying and for his room: just organizing his stuff or also sweeping, cleaning etc.)?

If it was a friend or something, then sure. But his mom? Come on, don't be obtuse; you know there's something kinda off about doing that.", "my parents had us do chores for computer time, online time, etc. too when we were young, so I can see where you're coming from, but I do think a 7 year old shouldn't have so much responsibility.

I'd have to say YTA.", "YTA. I think it\u2019s inappropriate to withhold time with his mom like that. That\u2019s super messed up to tell a kid they can\u2019t see their mom because they didn\u2019t do their chores. What an unfair responsibility to carry as a 7 year old. \n\nYou say he still gets to go to sports practices and that\u2019s the only exception. Is that not a \u201cfun\u201d thing? He can go have fun playing sports but not spend a couple hours with his mom? Sounds unnecessarily controlling.", "YTA - Tidying his room is one thing, but making a 7 year old do his own laundry is too much. You are being too strict and demanding too much from a small child. At most he should be helping with laundry, like doing some sorting or something.", "7?  He's 7?  \n\nOf course YTA!  He can *help* with laundry (taking his dirty clothes to the laundry area, putting his clean clothes away, etc).  But to DO it?  All by himself?  At 7?  \n\nYou're ridiculous.", "7? \n\nWow really trying for the evil stepmother stereotype there, eh. \n\nI bet you watched Cinderella and thought she was the bad guy in the house.  \n\nYTA\n\nI notice you also have a 9 month old baby.

But his mom? Give me a fucking break. The seven year old doing their own laundry thing is also incredibly weird, but that\u2019s another story.", "YTA.\n\nTeaching kids to do chores and behave responsibly is good, but part of being a responsible adult is knowing that you can occasionally be responsible later in order to do something time sensitive, and getting to hang out with his mom is definitely one of those situations.\n\nI don't find the laundry thing as weird as other people in terms of difficulty, but I do think it's kind of just busy-work; at least in my household, the limit on laundry is far more the physical dryer/washer time than any sort of folding so running a separate load just for his stuff seems silly when you could run combined and easily separate out his stuff.", "You're not wrong for expecting a child to do chores before fun time.  Is it wrong to expect him to do his chores on a specific schedule even when his mother, who lives far away, wants to spend time with him?  When he's 7?  Well yeah. \n\nI'm all for personal responsibility, but this rigid schedule seems unnecessarily strict for a small child.  Let him watch a movie with his mom ffs.\n\nYTA", "YTA. i had chores at the age of 7 too but mine was filling up few bottles of water and put it in the fridge. doing laundry is too much work for such young age.", "Laundry at 7?! That seems really young to me. I have an 8 year old and I wouldn\u2019t expect him to wash his own clothes! \n\nIn the UK that would definitely be something I would give to a teenager. At 7-9 years old I would expect them to tidy up after themselves and that\u2019s about it. \n\nMy 8 year old is pretty tidy in general so never had to enforce chores to be honest.", "YTA cleaning up his room is one thing his freaking laundry!! Are you serious? That is beyond ridiculous. He is 7!!", "YTA - He is 7 years old FFS! \ud83e\udd26", "YTA. Expecting that level of responsibility from a 7 year old and enforcing the rules in a manner that would deprive him of time with his mom are both very unreasonable.", "Soft YTA\n\n1. It sounds like him not getting his stuff done is a fairly normal occurrence. If that's so, he may need more support in it than you're giving him. A lot of kids find \"clean your room\" or \"do your laundry\" overwhelming because of there being so many steps and not knowing where to start. Cleaning up is a learned skill but a lot of parents forget this. Just because he's done it successfully before doesn't mean it's not still overwhelming for him. You need to find out what is getting in his way and provide that additional support if you're going to expect him to do this. Set your kid up for success, not stress. This may come in the form of a check list (1. All clothes in the hamper, 2. Sports equipment in their storage spot, 3. ...) Or other way of breaking it into something more manageable and less stressful.\n\n2. You're having to navigate a relationship with a difficult coparent. That's challenging. While it's good to maintain consistency at home, a 7 year old won't understand anything except that you're keeping him from his mother. If you keep rules rigid he won't learn the desired lesson (good habits and responsibility) but will come to resent you and the rules.\n\nIn adulthood we also try to be responsible and have expectations on us. And sometimes we can't get out of them, but sometimes we can. Sometimes we can ask off of work to go do that special thing, sometimes we can set up jobs where they let us have odd hours while still completing our responsibilities. Teaching a kid to be responsible is important, but it's also important to teach kids that sometimes people have mercy, to advocate for themselves, and that sometimes their personal life *should* take priority - within a balance.", "Yes YTA in every way. I can see having a seven year old assist you with the laundry and wanting to have a set day for him to clean up his room but not allowing him to do anything ever until he does what you ask is too much. Pick one punishment. For example, if you don\u2019t clean your room by bedtime on xyz day, you cannot play video games tonight or you cannot go to abc friends house tomorrow. Withholding quality time to spend with his mother seems like you\u2019re being vindictive and manipulating a child into doing things you don\u2019t want to do for him because he isn\u2019t your biological child. I will reiterate\u2026.YT fucking A!!", "So basically this kid is already torn to pieces because his family fell apart and now his step mom treats the ability to contact his own mother like a privilege that he has to do chores for. Yeah YTA, in what word do you as a step mom think it's okay to prevent a child from talking to his actual mother? You're just trying to stir up drama.", "YDefinitelyTA\n\nIt would be different if he were older and if it were to go out with friends. But a movie with his mother that lives states away? Denying that for any reason is evil or at the very least incredibly cold hearted toward a child. 7 year olds shouldn\u2019t be doing all of their own laundry. Maybe they could learn to fold clothes and put them away and pick up/put away toys, but Jesus. Sounds like a miserable roof to live under.", "Yta\nLet him be a kid", "My own kids did parts of the laundry at 7, so that part doesn't throw me as much. Here's where I think YTA, though. You are a step-parent actively preventing him from spending time with his mother. That should never, ever be linked to chores or anything else. It should never be used as a reward or a punishment. That is his mother. Messing with that is a sure-fire way to win evil stepmother awards. Don't do it.", "This is insane\ud83d\ude2d", "YTA for denying him time with a parent over laundry", "YTA. He's not your biological kid, so you shouldn't be punishing him by preventing him from seeing his own MOTHER! You give him entirely too many chores for his age. He's only SEVEN years old! That's way too young to be expected to do his own laundry and keep his bedroom clean. When my kids were that age, I did their laundry and helped them clean their bedrooms. They helped with other simple chores, like dusting the living room, unloading the dishwasher, and setting the table for dinner. Chores need to be age appropriate. You expect way too much from him and are far too rigid about it. Have fun when he rebels against all the strict control as a teen.", "YTA he is 7 years old not 17 pick up his toys and things yes do his own laundry no stop being a step b itch and either stay out of any and all parenting of him or accept that any decision his mother makes overrules any and all decision you make because YOU ARE NOT HIS PARENT and since YOU ARE NOT HIS PARENT you get zero say in any rules decisions or choices made for him.", "YTA\n\n>Sometimes she goes a few weeks without any contact at all\n\n>(she lives a few states away\n\nAre you serious. Let the poor kid have some contact with his mom!", "Totally TA. Are you serious ,you expect a 7 year old to do his own laundry. I hope you mean put it in the wash basket, and not load the machine ,put it on ,empty and dry it. If you do mean the 2nd then both you and your wife are TA's. 7 year olds should be enjoying life and learning. Not slaving to keep his clothes clean. Sounds a bit like child abuse to me.", "YTA.", "YTA I don\u2019t have a problem with you teaching your step child to do laundry but making the kid do all of their own laundry is too much! Make exceptions so the kid can spend time with their mom!", "YATAH. 7 is too young to do the laundry. If his mother goes MIA and is not consistent you shouldn\u2019t stop him from talking to her. He is still a little boy and you are punishing by taking away time with his mother. This is just bad parenting.", "YTA\n\nHe's seven. SEVEN. What seven year old is capable of doing laundry?? Laundry detergents are full of harmful chemicals, and I've definitely known 7yos who still put most things in their mouths! And you're punishing him by removing all stimulus and refusing him contact with his mother for not doing laundry? \n\nThat's abusive. It's cruel. I sincerely hope the mother calls CPS and goes for custody, because you two are monstrous for treating a child like that. And he is a child, a very young child. Teaching children the necessity of chores is important. Teaching them to safely do those chores at an appropriate age is important. Treating a 7yo like this? Nope, that's unacceptable.", "YTA. I'm 32 years old, married and a homeowner. Plenty of times I set a goal to get my laundry done and I don't meet it. I don't punish myself by not doing anything enjoyable, that's a shitty cycle to get into.", "YTA Evil stepmother. Did you learn anything from Disney?!", "YTA\n\nRegardless of anything else, chores are not to buy time with your parents. Punishments should not involve losing time with a parent.", "YTA-while I think it is appropriate for him to have some chores to do, I don\u2019t agree with him having to do his own laundry.  Keeping his room neat and tidy is appropriate but I have questions about him doing his own laundry. What does that entail?  Do you expect him to have his dirty clothes in the hamper or perhaps taken to the laundry room?  Do you really expect him to wash and dry his own clothes. You are leaving some information out here.   Until you clear up these questions, the YTA stands. I think you are asking too much of a 7 year old.", "YTA 7 is really early imo. I don\u2019t even think i could get clothes off the counter at that age lol let em be a child for a few more years", "YTA. It's fine for you to get him to do chores. But you prevented him from spending time with his bio mom and that's just petty. For better or worse it sounds like you don't like your stepson and are overly strict. Also the kid is 7. Cut him some slack. I'm in my 40s and I occasionally get lazy about laundry.", "YTA - Not for him having chores. I was doing laundry by the time I was 7 too, and I don't really think that's a big deal. Honestly, it was doing the dishes that young that I had a problem with. But where I think you went wrong is that this is his mother, not a friend. If it was something that happened every week, I would get your saying no or setting a specific day. But he hadn't seen his mother in a while, and while I get that this is her fault, it's not his fault and he should be able to see his mother the few chances that he gets.", "YTA - Having some tasks for a younger child to do is good to help them become responsible.\n\nBeing totally inflexible and rigid with them is an asshole move, especially if it impacts their relationship with a parent.", "I\u2019m shocked at these responses. NTA all the way. My younger kid is 10 and has been putting away his laundry for years. Putting away laundry (really the hardest part of \u201cdoing\u201d it since putting it in the washer or moving to the dryer can hardly count as a chore) and cleaning his room are not unreasonable chores for a 7 year old to do.

I have a 12 year old and all he does is the dishwasher and takes out the recycling into the big bin for collection and both of those have only been for the past 2 years. Obviously keeping his own room tidy is up to him as well, but you've put too much responsibility on a 7 yo. He should bring his washing over, or put in the washing bin, as and when needed but to do his washing himself is too much.\nYTA", "YTA and so is your husband. \n\nFrom someone who had a lot of responsibilities at a young age like him, I easily got overwhelmed and became really resentful. Obviously he can't seem to get it all done, so there's a problem. Yes, he's a kid and should clean his room but he does need help. His laundry? Do it for him- have him sort out the colors and teach him how to put those clothes away once they are folded. And to hold his mother over his head until he is done with his chores is a whole different type of cruelty. You and your husband are so wicked.", "I am al for age appropriate chores, doing is laundry at 7 isn't something I would do.  I am going to say NTA, you have a schedule, for a reason.  It sounds like his mother is the one who cannot keep to any sort of schedule with your step son.  Watching a movie and not talking is not an engaging activity.  Good grief!!   I would consider setting up scheduled remote visitations, this way you can still plan life around Mom.  If she can't adhere to it, that is on her, she has absolutely no right to expect that she can phone in at any time for whatever she wants.", "NTA- All of the Y-TA comments must be from teenagers. It\u2019s completely age appropriate to have a seven year old clean their own room and do their laundry. My two year old helps clean her room and helps with laundry. If she is two, a seven year old can easily do these tasks themselves. People forget that children used to work full time jobs 150 years ago. It\u2019s not robbing them of a childhood to expect them to take care of their rooms and belongings. Being consistent with the expectations is better for his development than making a bunch of exceptions. Also, you aren\u2019t denying them time together. Bio-Mom wants to bank up good mom points by watching a movie together without actually having to interact with son. Talking while he does his chores IS better quality time than sitting in silence watching a movie. Keep up the consistent expectations. You are raising a responsible young man!", "Nta.  Disney Mom doesn't care about raising her own kid, his schedule, or his responsibilities, but she wants to watch movies whenever she likes?  Nope.\n\nAlso, it is WILD how many people here are shitting themselves over the idea of having to do laundry.  Pick up cloth.  Throw cloth in washing bucket.  Turn a dial and push a button.

She asked if they could do it tomorrow instead and my husband said thats fine as long as he gets his room cleaned first. \n\nShe got upset and said that it's ridiculous that we are even expecting a seven year old to do his own laundry and clean his own room and that we should \"let him have fun and be a kid.\" She also said it's not fair that we are \"stopping them from spending time together.\" For the record, we have tried to set up regular times for them to do things like this together, but after a couple of weeks she will stop doing the scheduled calls. Sometimes she goes a few weeks without any contact at all. This is one of those instances when she hasn't been in contact for weeks and now all the sudden she wants to do something with him right now. They don't even talk during a movie, so really him talking to her in the phone while he does his chores would actually give them more bonding time.\n\nAre we wrong for expecting our seven year old to do his chores before doing extra \"fun\" activities during the week, even if they are with his mom?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Every day after school I had to go out and feed again. I also had to help with laundry, dishes, garbage, and keep my room cleaned. It wasn't abuse - it was the nature of living on a farm and having two very hard-working parents who wanted us to be able to become functional adults.

They\u2019re responsible for bringing their laundry to the washer, helping sort dry clothes if necessary and then putting their clothes away. Some things just aren\u2019t worth fighting over.  I find both my kids really respond well when I help them with their chores so I might help sort into piles or hang a couple of things up but they do most of it (I just help slowly on purpose lol).

It gave me a lot of great ideas.  Maybe he could just have a clean bin and dirty bin and not put his clothes away.  Do you want to fight about this weekly? I don\u2019t like clothes on the floor but don\u2019t care too much how well they\u2019re folded. Ask yourself what your priorities are and gently ask him what he struggles with most in doing this chore (other than just not wanting to do it).

I still help both kids clean their rooms though my 7 year old needs more help than my 9 year old.\n\nOur daughter would never put her dirty clothes in the hamper which is literally 3 feet from where she\u2019d leave them on the floor.  One day I was so exasperated and I asked her why it was so difficult to throw them in the hamper instead of leaving on the floor - she told me Dad had said she needs to turn her clothes back the right way (they\u2019re often inside out when she pulls them off) and at the moment she was changing she just didn\u2019t feel like it.  We came to a compromise that she\u2019d separate the tangled underwear from pants and the shirts from sweaters but she didn\u2019t have to turn them the right way and it\u2019s helped.

Do you tell them \u201csorry I have to do dishes and can\u2019t do anything else until they are done\u201d?

But this is about his mom who from what it sounds like puts this kid through a lot of disappointment, but he\u2019s 7 and he loves his bio mom.

I know that can be how it works as an adult, but a lot of children who grew up feeling like cleaning was a punishment grow up to be very messy adults, because cleaning becomes associated with negative emotions. Maybe when you start introducing more chores as he gets older make them fun family time, lots of people very much value memories like drying the dishes whilst their mum washed them having a heart to heart each evening etc. Make chores and cleaning into positive memories. \n\nHis bio mum doesn't seem like mother of the year in any sense, but do be careful about witholding time together, over time your son may resent you for it, especially if she tells him \"I wanted to spend time with you but your dad and OP wouldn't let me\" that's not to say you should live to her whims, but please keep that in mind. \n\nAnother thing I noticed in your comments was that you said they don't talk whilst watching movies together so you don't see it as quality time. Quality time is different for everyone, in an evening you may have time to watch TV with your son, you can take him to the cinema on a weekend etc. these things are all quality time spent together that his bio mum doesn't get because she lives away. I'm not going to assume why she skipped town when he was young, but maybe she doesn't really know any other way to spend time with him, some people aren't just \"naturally\" parents and have that maternal instinct, and so watching movies together may just be their thing because that's how they can easily and non awkwardly interact with each other. \n\nI think you care about your son and you're trying to be better, but empathy is key here, as is looking further into the future and how these things may affect him when he's older.

Perfectly reasonable and good habits to form while young.\n\nAs for bio mom, she needs to schedule these events in advance.

The reason I think you\u2019re the asshole is that you could make this easier for the kid by setting up a daily tidying up chart.  That way, they won\u2019t be stuck with the huge task on the day they get out of school early.  Just make sure they do they basic things daily like make the bed and put all water cups in the sink.

There\u2019s no reason to have them wash and dry their own clothes at this age.  I do think it would be okay to have them put away the folded clothes.  That\u2019s an appropriate task for a 7 year old.\n\nYou are making this cleaning into an onerous task they have to face down once a week.  It is your responsibility to make it manageable for the child to keep their room tidy and to allow for a bit of disarray.  And it is definitely your responsibility to launder their clothes for them.  At 7, they are not actually able to fold clothes well on their on their own.\n\nI think it\u2019s good for kids to have age-appropriate tasks and know how to chores.  But this is simply too much.\n\nAlso, you are the step-parent, and you should not be in the position to deny that child time with his mother under any circumstances.

Feel free to do some research on that. Also, I think it\u2019s unwise to give a child such a large window of time to complete these tasks. Of course he will procrastinate. Carve out a specific time for these tasks and stick to it. \n\nAlso don\u2019t listen to the people saying he\u2019s too young to do laundry.

Others will not have a clear understanding as to why it\u2019s being that way( not that you have to say anything at all)\n I totally agree with you, discipline has taken a back seat when it comes to toddlers as of late and this is a prime example. Years ago I had disciplined my son in an attempt to give him the opportunity to choose between what chores to complete in days throughout the week. My son and I had an agreement or verbal understanding what consequences there are if not completed? In short, his chores were not completed and his mother stated she needed to run an errand and was taking my son with her and I refused to let him go because of the agreement my son and I made.

I don\u2019t however see the problem with him doing his own laundry or as in this case helping to do his own laundry as my 3 year old loves being the one to bring her little laundry basket into the kitchen, \u201chelps\u201d me load and unload the machine (both hers and our clothes) and even \u201chelps\u201d put the clothes on the clothes horse to dry.

When I was around 16, I realised that I was in the minority doing my own washing. I asked my mother and her response was \"I would be doing you a disservice by doing something for you that you are more than capable of doing yourself\". Now, as an adult, I agree with her.\n\nI met my husband when I was 21. He was 27.

I have two sons. We all did all the laundry together from the time they were toddlers. I folded the t-shirts, they paired the socks and sorted out everyone\u2019s underwear.

I have 2 step kids and a bio kid. Instead of threatening to take things away maybe try giving him a reward when finishing it.

I get why you're doing it but even if she doesn't always put in the effort she is trying at this moment and it's not fair for either of them to miss out on it. Our oldest, the only one that is old enough to do chores like this, is allowed to do fun things before he gets his chores done as long as he (with help from us) gets them done that same day. He's allowed to go play with his friends as long as he comes inside and does his chores and then he can go right back outside. \n\nFor rewards instead of taking things away it doesn't have to be big things all the time, sometimes we give our oldest kiddo an extra hour to play outside, an extra half hour on his game console, an extra little fun snack that he doesn't normally get. \n\nIt sounds like you guys are trying and you're doing great but maybe tweak a few things to help encourage him a little more?", "YTA.

It\u2019s very possible that he\u2019s not just trying to avoid his responsibilities, but is actually truly struggling to start them. From the outside, this can often look like laziness or willful disobedience, but on the inside, his brain is in a very real struggle to do the things it doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nI highly recommend doing some research into parenting techniques for kids with ADHD and seeing if they help your kiddo more than the negative reinforcement route.", "you make a seven year old do their own laundry wtf.

Just a hey put away your toys and then we can go to the park, get ice cream, watch a movie, etc. Trust that 80% of parents in real life will agree with you.

I don\u2019t agree with that at all, but this doesn\u2019t reflect that at all either. Being made to do a chore and you just don\u2019t want to isn\u2019t abusing a child. You aren\u2019t limiting his interests such as sports or whatever else. He just can\u2019t get extra rewards such as park/movie/treats. And those are rewards, I saw a top comment say you\u2019re removing common things but I guess that\u2019s perspective. It was not common for my family to go weekly to the movies, get ice cream, arcade, etc. The park is one that we did do! But even then, if I wasn\u2019t doing my chores - no park! I was made to do chores every week, starting from that age - help in the kitchen, laundry, ironing my clothes, dishes, sweeping, tidying the room, making my bed, etc. AND I HATED IT. I would try to weasel my way out of it also. But eventually I learned if I get the stuff done, I was allowed to go out with friends, game, etc. but if I didn\u2019t then I wasn\u2019t allowed those freedoms. And I bring it up all the time now that I love that I was made to do that. I can\u2019t stand a messy room/bathroom. Not like ocd but like who wants a dirty ass bathroom/bedroom, you know how that looks? I clean the dishes as I cook. I routinely clean the bathroom so it doesn\u2019t build up and get harder to clean as my mom always said. Blows my mind when I hear other men well into their 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s don\u2019t know how to use a damn washing machine. \n\nAll of what you\u2019re saying you are asking of him takes a total of 1 hour give or take half an hour. From Monday to Friday, accounting for sleep and school, there are 40 free hours. An additional 20 when you count the weekend. You could potentially look to say instead of a set day, needs to be done this week or maybe M/TH be an option he can choose. To offer a little more flexibility since the world isn\u2019t always so rigid but really NTA lol.

It\u2019s important that he gets to see her even if it\u2019s watching a movie together from a distance when that\u2019s an option. Chores don\u2019t come before visitation.

What helped a lot with motivation though was that each specific chore had a \"point\" value based on how difficult/undesirable said chore was.  Cleaning the bathroom was considered the worst because of cleaning the toilet obviously was gross to us.  So worth the most points.  We could trade if one of the other brothers wanted the points instead of the easier chore like sweeping.  On Saturday we had a bin full of toys and candy that we could buy stuff with our points from.  Basically we were employees of a sort haha, taught us some good work ethic I think.  But people on here will probably say we were abused because of course.  All my brothers and I got real jobs and started working in middle school(ag jobs let you work earlier), so I think it taught us decently.", "Everyone here is acting like asking a seven year old to pick up after themselves is a punishment, and not a fact of life. At seven, he can absolutely bring his dirty laundry to the machines, stand on a stool, put in the soap, put in the clothes, and push the buttons. It also sounds like he is able to put away his laundry easily. He can also pick up and put away his toys, straighten his bed, and bring out the trash and dishes. THIS IS GOOD FOR HIM. It teaches him that there is value in his space and his things, and that he should take care of them. it's also good for him to learn that there is a cost to not doing these things, and that these things have to be done by a certain time.\n\nAll that being said, we're talking about him spending time with his absent non-custodial parent, not watching TV or playing on a device. This is time you admit he does not get frequently, and time you should be falling over yourself to give him. Never, ever should chores get in the way of his relationships with other people, and especially not with his parent. It should be parent time first, and then chores right after. For not putting this together, yes, YTA.\n\nAnother, minor, thing to consider is to stop making the cleaning of his room a one day affair. You should have time in his schedule between dinner and bed for him to tidy up every day, and then YOU one day a week should come in and do the deep cleaning he cannot (dust, sweep/mop/vacuum). This will make cleaning his room less a chore, and more a habit.", "YTA.\nThat kid is gonna have a jolting realization like 10 years from now about wtf was going on in his childhood. Do not be surprised when you stop hearing from him.", "Yta. My parents were like this and this is the only reason im extremely lazy and unwilling to do any chores.", "YTA he\u2019s seven, FUCKING SEVEN!", "Yeah, little dude is 7 years old. Have some chill and let the 7 year old be a kid. Yta. \n\nCleaning up his room, totally doable for a child. Doing laundry? Dude, that\u2019s a lot for a 7 year old. They can\u2019t even reach the buttons on a washer a dryer.\n\nEdit: I forgot to include how disturbing it is you take time away from his own mother if he doesn\u2019t get chores done. You\u2019re going to ruin his future relationship with his dad. You\u2019re so ungodly controlling and strict, it\u2019s gross.", "YTA. \nFor punishing him by taking away time with his mother.  Ever heard of parental interference? Yeah, you did that.  \n\nIt is okay to teach children how to do housework- they need to know for when they are living on their own.  But 7 is a little young for the expectations that you have. Mine was expected to put toys up and help put up folded laundry. But not do his own laundry.  \n\nAnd why does he have to do these things on Monday and Wednesday nights? Which are school nights. Why not just do weekend chores? \n\nAnyhoo, stop punishing him by taking away his Mom time. Doesn\u2019t matter if she is flighty and inconsistent. You have no right to keep him from spending time with her even it is virtual time.", "YTA, he\u2019s 7! He should be taken care of and chores shouldn\u2019t be that long. It\u2019s actually a good opportunity for the child to learn how to get some enjoyment out of chores instead of learning that chores are punishment that keeps you from doing fun things.", "He\u2019s 7 for f\u2019s sake. He should be worrying about school. Picking up his room is reasonable, but that\u2019s too young for laundry duty. Dealing with classes all day is enough for his brain at that age. Keeping him from his mom in any form is a great way to make him hate you and when it starts that young it will be there for the rest of his life.", "YTA- he\u2019s 7 and you have unreasonable expectations but you are beginning a good trend. Also you DEFINITELY should\u2019ve let him watch a movie with his Mom. It\u2019s not his fault she\u2019s pops up here and there and you definitely interfered with their relationship. He could\u2019ve cleaned up his room after the movie or the next day. You\u2019re way too rigid.", "Even after the edit, I still think you and your husband are a big, big AH. You mentioned that he has to do the chores on x day, but he just does simple tasks. I imagine that if you ask him to do a simple task, you have to accompany him to take the hamper to the laundry area and open the machine for him. The adults should accompany him every single step for those assigned chores. Since the adults have to be present in the scenes, then the adults should lead the situation. Why do you expect him to think on his own? I still don't understand how you expect him to inform you that he's ready to do laundry now. Can you help me take the hamper to the laundry area? Can you open the machine for me? I'm sorry; I can't imagine how the reality would be in your explanation. He is 7 years old! Don't be surprised when he is older and does not respect you. You are a step mother of Cinderella.", ">It doesn't sit right, either, that you say laundry day is to the end of the day on Monday but you actually expect it done on Sunday.\n\nTen'll get you twenty that if he does it on Sunday they add other chores on Monday", "Keeping your room tidy and laundry is not wild for a 7 year old. Children should know life skills. These are the same chores i had growing up. That\u2019s not unreasonable at all. They also help him with a lot of what he does. He should be learning these things.

We conserved water by not having each kid wash a load of clothes. We might do three loads on Sunday but we'd have done at least 7 if everyone did his/her own! We were taught to wash clothes and could start a load, put it in the dryer, fold, etc. Then everyone took the appropriate clothing and put it away. This \"everyone needs to do his own laundry\" isn't very efficient. Combining and running full loads is much better and costs less in water, detergent, and electricity. At 7, he could certainly do some folding, bring dirty clothes to the hamper, and put away clean clothes. He could probably even transfer a load if she said, \"Hey buddy, I'm cooking dinner. Could you put the clothes in the dryer now?\" Doing his own laundry at 7 is probably something that could be reworked to be more appropriate.", "My kid was putting away her laundry before she was 7, it's not a lot to expect.

It's definitely not our intention to punish him when he fails but I do see now that's what it's turned into.

My heart hurts for teenage you and it really is eye opening. I really appreciate this comment. Thank you so much for sharing.", "This is helpful. Thank you! I will definitely check those books out too. I often feel like I am drowning, and it seems like he might feel that way too so it sounds like there might be some good things in there for us and I really love the concept of meeting him where he's at and working from there.

It's nice to read something positive though, so thank you.", "Thank you for the insight/suggestion. I will definitely look into this.", "We don't consider talking to his mom a fun activity and have never stopped them from talking to each other or seeing each other. The fun activity is the movie.

We help him get his clothes in, get the machine started, switch it over and get the dryer started. Then he is responsible for getting it out of the dryer and putting it away.", "I definitely see what you're saying here. Our thought was that he is seeing her this weekend, so we wanted to make sure his laundry was done so he would have clean clothes to bring for the visit and that he would be seeing her this weekend anyway. We also don't have a problem with him talking with her on FaceTime, she just didn't want to do that option. We just wanted his laundry finished before getting to do a movie (when she has stuck with a schedule in the past we have never stopped him from watching a movie with her, but last minute right before a visit felt different to us).", "I absolutely agree with this. I get frustrated with her because I just don't understand how a parent can be so absent. We miss him so much when he leaves to go visit her for a month in the summer and I just couldn't imagine being okay with going that long without even talking to him. BUT we definitely do our best to hide our frustration with his mom from him and only say positive things about her when he is around.", "Thank you for the book recommendation! I will definitely check it out.", "I'm a big fan of positive reinforcement vs punishment. \n\nI think it's good to have him do chores that he's able to accomplish on his own. But I think he's too young to just tell him to get it done by a deadline. Time management is hard for some of us and getting him in the routine will be more helpful in the long run, imo. He needs to learn time management later on, but right now I would be more focused on the habits and routines. \n\nMaybe you could try a combination? Like, he can do his laundry early if he wants, but if not, then at x time, you get him started on it if he hasn't already. And even if you set 4pm as the time (for example) and mom wants to watch a movie at 3pm with him, then you just change the time to 5:30pm after the movie. It can be flexible for family activities or other needs. Learning to be flexible is also an important life skill. \n\nI just know how much anxiety these things cause me and the dread is 1000 times worse than the actual task. So by getting him started at x time, you at least don't prolong the anxiety.", ">I really appreciate the way you put this. Rather than having the threat of taking things away, it's better to earn a reward for getting it done. Is that what you're saying? I think it makes a lot of sense and you're right, it's probably a better way to approach it. \n\nI personally don't think your current method is *wrong*, per say. The basis is decent, at least, because it seems that you're really just trying to set up good habits about self-discipline early. But I do think it's a bit premature and... one-sided, I guess? Or maybe *imbalanced*? \n\nA 7-year-old will respond much better to a reward-based system than one that is more limiting and feels punitive (what you have now). \n\nAnd yeah, I agree that \"general family time\" shouldn't be what's ostensibly taken away when he doesn't get his chores done in a timely manner at this point. So maybe instead of, \"We won't watch any movies together until it's done\", it becomes, \"*You* can chose what movie we all watch together *if* you get your chores done beforehand; otherwise, *we* get to choose.\" \n\nI think at his age especially, it's better to offer that positive incentive to get him motivated and even *excited* about getting his chores done. And plenty of adults who struggle with procrastination and self-motivation successfully enact similar reward-based tactics, so it's certainly not a bad mindset to instill in him.", "It doesn't even have to be a reward, neccessarily. Make it a bit more fun, a bit more engaged. You could be in his room with him as cleans, maybe both you of you dancing to music.  Or make it a challenge, \"how many of [type of toy] can you find in *x* minutes?\" Or see who can find the most of a type of toy.  Split it up into smaller peices, \"get all of [this item] and [this item] put away and we'll go have some ants on a log.\" Or \"get the laundry machine started and we'll go [more enjoyable activity] until its ready to change over.\" And never underestimate the power of celebratory dance and cheering for young kids.", "Mom of a severe ADHD child here- you could have punished my son from sun up to sun down with no change in attitude or behavior. Offer a reward and it was a completely different story. I love that you are taking what has been to heart. People simply do not hear enough positive feedback in life. I have no problem knowing what I\u2019m doing wrong, I need reminders of what I\u2019m doing well, because I never think of them on my own.", "I also think you're expecting things that aren't age appropriate from him - doing chores is fine, especially since you help him with the laundry, but at 7 he is too young to schedule his days between chores, homework, play, and sports. That kind of organization is something you should be coaching him through actively every day. A 12-13 year old can manage a healthy personal routine, but a 7-year-old is just naturally going to want to play (and that's fine).\n\nAt 7, it's not \"have you done your chores,\" but \"let's do your chores now!\" And incentivizing with fun music & energy and a small reward after that is going to build positive associations. Right now, he likely only feels avoidance. That's not a good way to build good habits.", "It's amazing that you're open to feedback! \nA positive reward works much better than a negative one, according to science.\nAlso, as a step kid, and a sibling of mum's stepkid's, don't have him do his own laundry. To have to do our laundry separately is a grudge my sister and I both hold against our corresponding stepmums, even if we don't want to. He's 7, so I'd suggest a lighter,  but daily chore instead, like taking his dishes to the kitchen. Please don't make him do his laundry separately. If you want him engaged in the laundry, make it a once or twice weekly laundry date between the two of you, when you load the machine together with everyone's laundry, and make it fun (in my case it'd be me being able to press/rotate the buttons).", "I was diagnosed at 7 with ADHD and when I was a kid cleaning my room was always a fight. It didn't matter how many punishments I was given ( I. E. spanking, grounding, ect.)

If she calls outside of it or wants to do something outside of it, just tell her no and to call back at her scheduled time. Don't involve the kiddo at all. It will keep you from having to worry about stuff like this. Calls with mom are on a day when there are no chores and only on those days. If that doesn't work for her schedule, tough.

She could literally just tell him to clean his room, and the problem would be solved.\n\n>*But I do see that we probably have become too rigid*\n\nMaybe, but maybe not. It's important for kids to learn responsibility and autonomy. A lot of parents coddle their kids, and that's why the older generation looks down on Gen Z kids like they're incompetent pigeons or something. If you never give your kid responsibility, it's very likely that he'll never learn how to take care of himself. I was doing my laundry at 7/8, and mowing the lawn at 9. I never felt like a slave. I had two arms and two legs, and my parents taught me how to use them. There's nothing wrong with forcing your children to do simple tasks like laundry, homework, cleaning their room, and taking out the trash.\n\nOn that note, I do think a *reward* is a good way to encourage good behavior. My parents did pay me for mowing the lawn. Maybe give the kid some type of treat if he can go a month without falling behind on his chores. It'll make him much more eager to do them, and he'll feel much more accomplished after getting the reward. That sense of accomplishment is what makes people feel like they can do *more*.\n\nYou sound like a fine parent.

At first it was a putting things away game - since he was 3 it was an expectation for keeping his toys (if he doesn't put them away they get taken away and he can earn them back by cleaning up without fuss the next day).  He knows any mess he makes is his to clean up.  As he gets older any age appropriate chores around taking care of his own self will fall on him - he will also learn to cook because that is a thing all humans should know.

OP, I don't think tidying up and putting clothes away is age inappropriate in general, but his ongoing inability to complete these tasks reminds me of myself at that age. It sounds like you are doing your best and you are trying to raise a self-sufficient child, which is great, but I think the approach just isn't quite right for your specific child at this time. There could be a lot of reasons for that but I'll tell you mine:\n\nI went undiagnosed with ADHD as a child (because it was the '80s and it was considered a thing that only boys got) and my inability to do chores became monumental. I still struggle with it today. As soon as I feel overwhelmed, I just shut down and am I mentally and emotionally paralyzed. As a child, I would sit there looking at the task, fully understanding that I was going to be punished if I didn't get it done, and still couldn't do it because the \"I don't know where to start\" problem was absolutely crippling. It wasn't that I wanted to be punished, it wasn't that I didn't care, it wasn't that I was a bad kid. The part of my brain that should be telling me \"Just pick up the shirt on top and start there\" is in a frequent state of malfunction which leads to massive spirals of sitting on the couch doing literally nothing at all which leads to feelings of \"why bother trying, I'm just a failure.\"\n\n(I'm actually experiencing this at this very moment by being on Reddit posting here instead of doing my job, btw. I have a report to write and I have blank page paralysis, but here I am having no problem on Reddit while mulling over quitting my job instead of writing this report. My own brain is deeply toxic to me.)\n\nIt would have helped me immensely as a child to either have fewer tasks required of me or more support in the process of doing them until they become habit. My brain simply doesn't know how to pick a spot and get started, but if I have a list of steps I can get things done really well. As an adult, I use to-do lists with sub-lists of of how-to a great deal to keep me on task. \"Clean the bathroom\" doesn't work, but listing out each thing in the bathroom that needs to be done is like Dumbo's magic feather to my brain. I need the visual and tactile experience of crossing things off the list so I can see my to-do list shrinking. That's how I set myself up for success.\n\nA question for you to really think about: do you need help with things sometimes? Have you ever needed your husband or a co-worker pick up a bit of slack for you because you were in a bind or just needed an extra hand? Have you ever had to order pizza because making supper is something you just can't do that day? When those situations happen, do you get punished for needing help? We all need help sometimes -- and kids need more help with a lot of things because they are kids! -- and it's deeply unfair to hold a small child to a higher standard than you hold yourself to. Your child needs some help to be successful here and that's okay.\n\nWhat I would suggest for your situation right now is pick one chore, and create a list of steps for just that one chore for him to follow. \"Tidy room: 1. put clothes in hamper. 2. make bed. 3. put action figures in toy bin. 4. put stuffies on bed. 5. put lego in lego box\" etc. Break it down into steps, maybe do a sticker chart so he puts a sticker next to each step so he can see he did it. Start off helping him every time, then every second time, then every third time, until he's doing it on his own and has tidying his room nailed down. *Then* introduce another chore, but only one step of it. Start with *just* putting his clothes away after you or your husband has washed and dried and put the basket in his room. Again, do it with him at first then wean him off of the help to create the habit. Then move on to introducing each step of the chore one at a time. \n\nThe only strong Y-T-A part is linking chores to spending time with his bio-mom. I've been both a step-kid and a step-parent, and that is just not acceptable. Your role should be helping to make those interactions happen, not putting up roadblocks by making those interactions bargaining chips or negotiation tactics. Yes, even if you end up having to just suck it up and tidy up his toys yourself once in a while because you have guests and he's going away with his mom.\n\nAssuming there are no necessary or court-mandated restrictions due to neglect or abuse, talking on the phone is something that should be able to happen anytime they both want to talk. It's not for you to decide that watching a movie long-distance isn't quality time and you emphatically should not ever make such a suggestion within earshot of your step-son. It's quality time *to him* and that's what matters. He will remember that his bio-mom made time to watch that movie with him (and that you helped make it happen) even if they aren't in the same room together. Besides, who talks through movies? My husband and I don't routinely talk to each other while at a movie because that's rude but it's no less a date night because of it.", "Don't listen to all the downvotes (watch - I'll get downvoted for this comment).

Make it fun and something he would enjoy. \nMy kids has baskets  in their rooms where they put their dirty clothes. I collect or they put them in the laundry room.", "Another helpful thing is to make a routine that has it tied to another activity so even if your daily schedule is off the kid still know what needs done and when to do it. \n\nFor example, I like to do the dishes from yesterday while I\u2019m waiting on the microwave to cook & my food to cool down. You can get a surprising amount of dishes loaded or put away in 3-5 minutes. I don\u2019t always eat at the same time nor do I clean at the same time but by tying the 2 task together it\u2019s something that always get\u2019s done.\n\nFor your 7yr old you could tie the cleaning his room (which is really just put toys away & clear out garbage I assume?) to be done after he is done using a particular toy. Make it a clean as you go type thing, so if he\u2019s not actively using it he needs to put it back. \n\nI also think it might be better to have laundry be a weekend chore instead of weekday chore as it\u2019s somewhat time consuming (just washing & drying my clothes takes over 90 minutes. Adding the time I spend putting the clean clothes away can easily make it take over 2 hours. That\u2019s a lot of time lost on a day that\u2019s already been mostly consumed by school.) Better to do laundry on the weekend so he has the whole day(s) to do it. \n\nFor school nights you could pick simpler/quicker/easy and short chores for him to do. Like take out the trash, vacuum 1 specific room, dust/wipe down counters or the table, or dry the dishes (if you don\u2019t have a dishwashing machine, if you have a dishwasher you could have him either load *or* empty it, preferably between finishing dinner and enjoying desert). Pick something that takes less than an hour to do so he doesn\u2019t feel like any specific school night sucks due to the heavy loss of time to himself. \n\nOf course if there\u2019s something special going on (spending time with his mom should hopefully be obvious as an example) you can make exceptions and alter the routine slightly. Tell your kid it\u2019s a one time exception and explain why as well as when it should be done instead. \n\nLast but not least make sure he know how to do each and any chore he has. Step by step instructions and be will to show him or walk through it with him explaining the process. Then if at any point after that he still needs help make sure he feels comfortable asking for it.", "He probably hasn\u2019t developed strong time management skills yet, which is where you step in and help him learn. I think it\u2019s fine to restrict fun things until the important things are done first, because as an adult if you neglect hygiene you face consequences. Kids probably won\u2019t have the motivation to do chores on their own but you can still teach them how they are done and build habits & routines for when & why they get done. \n\nConsider teaching him how to clean as he goes (so he has less work later), how to recognize when a chore needs to be done (so he just does it without you having to remind him frequently), time management (do the hard stuff first, so it only gets easier and you have more energy), and how to multitask. Chores can be quick and easy if you set up your house in a way that makes sense to you. \n\nStart by setting yourself (and your kid) up for success. If his room is habitually chaotic (clothes all over the floor, toys randomly scattered too, garbage piling up, or shoes in a place they frequently get tripped on) y\u2019all will benefit from rearranging his room & maybe adding some organization tools.\n\nTo keep my home clean I\u2019ve found it\u2019s easier if I put an organizer in the place where piles tend to build up. Things like Shoe racks (no more tripping hazards!), hooks on the wall (for keys, coats, hats, & backpacks, to keep them off the floor), laundry baskets (no more lost socks), garbage cans (wrappers on the floor attract ants), shelves (for books, video games, dvds, etc.), and bins for anything else can make a huge difference in how cluttered a home/room gets. \n\nPut simply: turn your piles into intentionally organized spaces. It will be easier for your kid (and you) to keep areas clean. Everything has a space and everything in its place! Teach your kid to put what he\u2019s using away before grabbing something else, suddenly you (and your kid) stop creating clutter! \n\nAnother useful tool is connecting chores to visual cues or other chores that can run in the background at the same time. For example I (un)load the dishwasher while microwaving food, and I clean the counters or floors while doing laundry. Other chores I use visual cues that tell me when I need to do them. I take the trash out when the lid no longer closes easily & laundry is done when clothes are piled above the edges of the hamper. I give the dog water or food when the bowl is completely empty. Visual cues teach your kid how to do chores without relying on you to remind them. \n\nThis may sound obvious/ redundant but kids don\u2019t have the life experience or executive function for those skills to be automatic for them. This is where you step in as a parent to teach them. Explaining the reason behind why he has to do a certain chore never hurts. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll enjoy getting the time back when he realizes he can do 2 chores at the same time! \n\nBetween school and homework, being forced to do a time-consuming chore like laundry probably leaves him feeling like he has no time to himself. It might be helpful to transition from chores being something he does at (to his brain) an arbitrary time, to following a routine that flows and makes sense. Swapping laundry day to a weekend seems like the obvious choice to me. \n\nTry this out as a Saturday morning routine: wake up -> eat breakfast , -> load dirty clothes & run machine (including Friday night\u2019s PJ\u2019s, -> shower, -> move wet clothes to dryer & run, -> clean room while the dryer runs, -> then put clean clothes away, after that he has the whole weekend to do whatever he wants! If your kid wakes up between 9-10 he could probably get both chores (laundry & clean room) done before noon. In 2hours he\u2019s done all of his chores in one block! \n\nHis reward is clean clothes and a clean room to have fun in again, and the peace of *truly* relaxing instead of procrastinating while it nags at the back of his brain. \n\nBy having him work smarter instead of harder (teaching him how to multitask, teaching him the cues & routine that tell when to do a chore, how to keep his room clean throughout the week, and getting them done after breakfast on the weekend *before* leisure time) you\u2019ll teach him good habits and effective time management skills. \n\nYour kid is capable and at this point should know what\u2019s expected of him, but he might not have enough life experience to figure out how to manage time efficiently and stay focused for the ~2 hours it takes to do laundry and clean his room. Do him the favor of creating an efficient routine and teaching him how to multitask and work smarter not harder. \n\nAlso if he doesn\u2019t understand why he needs to keep his room clutter-free there\u2019s plenty of science that states having a clean space improves mental health and focus, and also stepping on legos hurts!", "Such a typical response. I love it when people in the minority of a situation say oh no I'm not like that. Or oh no that doesn't apply in my case.", "I think one thing that gets lost in strict families is that kids have feelings and struggles the same as adults. Why aren't they given the room to figure out how to make things work within frameworks that fit them?\n\nDo you do chores on the same days every week? Do you do them in exactly the same way that your parents did? \n\nKeeping his room clean and doing his laundry isn't an unreasonable expectation, but expecting it to happen on a certain day or in a certain way is a little unreasonable. Maybe he'd prefer to fold his shirts and pants instead of hanging the shirts? Maybe his room isn't actually messy one week. Maybe he's in a better space to do laundry on Fridays than on Mondays. Maybe he'd rather clean his room on Tuesdays. Maybe those days change from week to week depending on the day he's had.\n\nAlso, laundry is 90% inactive time.

Because in isolation, laundry and tidying one's room aren't big chores, and while I do think 7 is a little young for laundry - my family started doing one's own laundry at 10 - it's not a huge overreach.\n\nBut the requirement that it be done on a specific day, by or at a specific time, is a step too far imo. Kids need structure and deadlines, but they also deserve understanding and flexibility. Maybe something like \"the room must be tidied after school once a week\" but let him choose the day (and it becomes a \"must do today\" if it reaches Friday), and \"laundry must be done over the weekend\" but can be anytime from Saturday morning to Sunday night (and similarly must be done by EOD Sunday) would be my suggestion.\n\nAlso, kids do well with reward-based structures, which is entirely absent here. Maybe provide a diminishing reward depending on when in the allotted time period he does the chore - if he does laundry on Saturday, they go out and get ice cream, but if he doesn't do it til Sunday afternoon he just gets a cookie when it's done or something. Similarly with the room cleaning, one really good reward if he does it Mon/Tues, a good reward if he does it Weds/Thurs, and a small reward if he does it Friday.", "Yes!

I\u2019m not saying this young man cannot handle it, but I think having to put the clothes away properly is good enough at 7. If OP and husband want him to have more responsibilities, they should pick a few smaller things.

But of course I don't expect her to do her laundry independently! I'm tickled that she is excited to do chores with me, for however long it lasts, lol. But I feel like you have to have reasonable expectations of a child that age. For mine, it's helping to load and start the machines, and learning to fold things with minor help/advice. She puts her clothes away by herself because she's extremely particular about where things go. If she was a different kid who didn't care about chores and organizing, I wouldn't push this on her in 2nd grade. I agree ESH though because bio mom does not sound like a very involved parent even for living out of state.

He started wanting up help out at like 3 or 4 with washcloths and napkins and then I would fold his clothes and help him put them away, then I would help him fold his clothes and he would put them away, and now he can fold and put them away and sometimes he'll help me switch from the washer to the dryer or pull the clothes out of the dryer and put them in the laundry basket. \n\nMy son loves helping out though and being independent and he does have to help with dinner a few times a week.  He will pull a chair to the sink and scrub potatoes or carrots, he also has his own knife and finger guard for chopping potatoes or garlic.
