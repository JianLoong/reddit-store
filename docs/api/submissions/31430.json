He gets out of school early on Wednesdays and we often encourage him to get his laundry started on Sundays (usually he would rather wait and get it started on Monday). The only rule we have when it comes to these chores is if they aren't done by the end of the day that they're supposed to be, the next day he has to stay in his room until the task is done. He still gets to go to sports practices, but other than that we don't do anything extra like watch a movie or go to the park until he gets these things done. For the record, when he actually puts effort in and buckles down and does it, neither of these things take him very long. The exception of course is when he is actively stalling. \n\nAnyway, his mom called and wanted to watch a movie with him tonight (she lives a few states away so this would be a virtual thing where they are basically both putting the same movie on at the same time.) We said they can watch a movie after dinner if he gets his laundry finished when he gets home from school (he spent all night last night actively avoiding getting it done.) She got upset because she has plans later tonight so the only time she can do it is right after school. We said she could call and talk to him while he works on his laundry, but he couldn't do a movie unless his chores were done. She asked if they could do it tomorrow instead and my husband said thats fine as long as he gets his room cleaned first. \n\nShe got upset and said that it's ridiculous that we are even expecting a seven year old to do his own laundry and clean his own room and that we should \"let him have fun and be a kid.\" She also said it's not fair that we are \"stopping them from spending time together.\" For the record, we have tried to set up regular times for them to do things like this together, but after a couple of weeks she will stop doing the scheduled calls. Sometimes she goes a few weeks without any contact at all. This is one of those instances when she hasn't been in contact for weeks and now all the sudden she wants to do something with him right now. They don't even talk during a movie, so really him talking to her in the phone while he does his chores would actually give them more bonding time.\n\nAre we wrong for expecting our seven year old to do his chores before doing extra \"fun\" activities during the week, even if they are with his mom?\n\nEdited to add (copied this from my response to a comment asking for more info):\n\nWe help him load the washer/dryer and all of that. Then it's his responsibility to take the clothes out of the dryer and put them away. He has to fold his pants and hang up the shirts (we have a low bar in his closet that he can easily reach). Every second or third time he puts his clothes away we will help him just to make sure things are staying organized and not getting out of control. \n\nPicking up his room is basically just putting his toys away and taking any empty water cups out. Every month or so we go through it together to help make sure things are staying organized.\n\nEdit 2: he only does his own laundry, not ours.

You're only using the stick.   So at the same time as providing no incentive you're also removing pretty normal activities that aren't treats as much as simple family time.   \n\nIt doesn't sit right, either, that you say laundry day is to the end of the day on Monday but you actually expect it done on Sunday.   \n\nSecondly, time with his bio mom is never a negotiating point.   Never.  Sure she's unreliable and not a good parent by the sounds,  but she's not putting the kid in danger or hurting him and you've no right to get in the way of their relationship.  How do you think that will work out in the future if you continue to insist bio mom is second or third or last?  Can you not see that you could well breed enough resentment that kiddo rejects you and turns to her?   \n\nSo YTA.  Kiddo needs flexibility.   He needs rewards for behaviour you wish to reinforce.   His family time, and bio mom time,  is a priority and not a punishment.", "INFO What does doing the laundry and cleaning his room entail? What do you expect him to do (for the washing: just sorting and folding or also actually washing and drying and for his room: just organizing his stuff or also sweeping, cleaning etc.)?

If it was a friend or something, then sure. But his mom? Come on, don't be obtuse; you know there's something kinda off about doing that.", "my parents had us do chores for computer time, online time, etc. too when we were young, so I can see where you're coming from, but I do think a 7 year old shouldn't have so much responsibility.

I'd have to say YTA.", "YTA. I think it\u2019s inappropriate to withhold time with his mom like that. That\u2019s super messed up to tell a kid they can\u2019t see their mom because they didn\u2019t do their chores. What an unfair responsibility to carry as a 7 year old. \n\nYou say he still gets to go to sports practices and that\u2019s the only exception. Is that not a \u201cfun\u201d thing? He can go have fun playing sports but not spend a couple hours with his mom? Sounds unnecessarily controlling.", "YTA - Tidying his room is one thing, but making a 7 year old do his own laundry is too much. You are being too strict and demanding too much from a small child. At most he should be helping with laundry, like doing some sorting or something.", "7?  He's 7?  \n\nOf course YTA!  He can *help* with laundry (taking his dirty clothes to the laundry area, putting his clean clothes away, etc).  But to DO it?  All by himself?  At 7?  \n\nYou're ridiculous.", "7? \n\nWow really trying for the evil stepmother stereotype there, eh. \n\nI bet you watched Cinderella and thought she was the bad guy in the house.  \n\nYTA\n\nI notice you also have a 9 month old baby.

But his mom? Give me a fucking break. The seven year old doing their own laundry thing is also incredibly weird, but that\u2019s another story.", "YTA.\n\nTeaching kids to do chores and behave responsibly is good, but part of being a responsible adult is knowing that you can occasionally be responsible later in order to do something time sensitive, and getting to hang out with his mom is definitely one of those situations.\n\nI don't find the laundry thing as weird as other people in terms of difficulty, but I do think it's kind of just busy-work; at least in my household, the limit on laundry is far more the physical dryer/washer time than any sort of folding so running a separate load just for his stuff seems silly when you could run combined and easily separate out his stuff.", "You're not wrong for expecting a child to do chores before fun time.  Is it wrong to expect him to do his chores on a specific schedule even when his mother, who lives far away, wants to spend time with him?  When he's 7?  Well yeah. \n\nI'm all for personal responsibility, but this rigid schedule seems unnecessarily strict for a small child.  Let him watch a movie with his mom ffs.\n\nYTA", "YTA. i had chores at the age of 7 too but mine was filling up few bottles of water and put it in the fridge. doing laundry is too much work for such young age.", "Laundry at 7?! That seems really young to me. I have an 8 year old and I wouldn\u2019t expect him to wash his own clothes! \n\nIn the UK that would definitely be something I would give to a teenager. At 7-9 years old I would expect them to tidy up after themselves and that\u2019s about it. \n\nMy 8 year old is pretty tidy in general so never had to enforce chores to be honest.", "YTA cleaning up his room is one thing his freaking laundry!! Are you serious? That is beyond ridiculous. He is 7!!", "YTA - He is 7 years old FFS! \ud83e\udd26", "YTA. Expecting that level of responsibility from a 7 year old and enforcing the rules in a manner that would deprive him of time with his mom are both very unreasonable.", "Soft YTA\n\n1. It sounds like him not getting his stuff done is a fairly normal occurrence. If that's so, he may need more support in it than you're giving him. A lot of kids find \"clean your room\" or \"do your laundry\" overwhelming because of there being so many steps and not knowing where to start. Cleaning up is a learned skill but a lot of parents forget this. Just because he's done it successfully before doesn't mean it's not still overwhelming for him. You need to find out what is getting in his way and provide that additional support if you're going to expect him to do this. Set your kid up for success, not stress. This may come in the form of a check list (1. All clothes in the hamper, 2. Sports equipment in their storage spot, 3. ...) Or other way of breaking it into something more manageable and less stressful.\n\n2. You're having to navigate a relationship with a difficult coparent. That's challenging. While it's good to maintain consistency at home, a 7 year old won't understand anything except that you're keeping him from his mother. If you keep rules rigid he won't learn the desired lesson (good habits and responsibility) but will come to resent you and the rules.\n\nIn adulthood we also try to be responsible and have expectations on us. And sometimes we can't get out of them, but sometimes we can. Sometimes we can ask off of work to go do that special thing, sometimes we can set up jobs where they let us have odd hours while still completing our responsibilities. Teaching a kid to be responsible is important, but it's also important to teach kids that sometimes people have mercy, to advocate for themselves, and that sometimes their personal life *should* take priority - within a balance.", "Yes YTA in every way. I can see having a seven year old assist you with the laundry and wanting to have a set day for him to clean up his room but not allowing him to do anything ever until he does what you ask is too much. Pick one punishment. For example, if you don\u2019t clean your room by bedtime on xyz day, you cannot play video games tonight or you cannot go to abc friends house tomorrow. Withholding quality time to spend with his mother seems like you\u2019re being vindictive and manipulating a child into doing things you don\u2019t want to do for him because he isn\u2019t your biological child. I will reiterate\u2026.YT fucking A!!", "So basically this kid is already torn to pieces because his family fell apart and now his step mom treats the ability to contact his own mother like a privilege that he has to do chores for. Yeah YTA, in what word do you as a step mom think it's okay to prevent a child from talking to his actual mother? You're just trying to stir up drama.", "YDefinitelyTA\n\nIt would be different if he were older and if it were to go out with friends. But a movie with his mother that lives states away? Denying that for any reason is evil or at the very least incredibly cold hearted toward a child. 7 year olds shouldn\u2019t be doing all of their own laundry. Maybe they could learn to fold clothes and put them away and pick up/put away toys, but Jesus. Sounds like a miserable roof to live under.", "Yta\nLet him be a kid", "My own kids did parts of the laundry at 7, so that part doesn't throw me as much. Here's where I think YTA, though. You are a step-parent actively preventing him from spending time with his mother. That should never, ever be linked to chores or anything else. It should never be used as a reward or a punishment. That is his mother. Messing with that is a sure-fire way to win evil stepmother awards. Don't do it.", "This is insane\ud83d\ude2d", "YTA for denying him time with a parent over laundry", "YTA. He's not your biological kid, so you shouldn't be punishing him by preventing him from seeing his own MOTHER! You give him entirely too many chores for his age. He's only SEVEN years old! That's way too young to be expected to do his own laundry and keep his bedroom clean. When my kids were that age, I did their laundry and helped them clean their bedrooms. They helped with other simple chores, like dusting the living room, unloading the dishwasher, and setting the table for dinner. Chores need to be age appropriate. You expect way too much from him and are far too rigid about it. Have fun when he rebels against all the strict control as a teen.", "YTA he is 7 years old not 17 pick up his toys and things yes do his own laundry no stop being a step b itch and either stay out of any and all parenting of him or accept that any decision his mother makes overrules any and all decision you make because YOU ARE NOT HIS PARENT and since YOU ARE NOT HIS PARENT you get zero say in any rules decisions or choices made for him.", "YTA\n\n>Sometimes she goes a few weeks without any contact at all\n\n>(she lives a few states away\n\nAre you serious. Let the poor kid have some contact with his mom!", "Totally TA. Are you serious ,you expect a 7 year old to do his own laundry. I hope you mean put it in the wash basket, and not load the machine ,put it on ,empty and dry it. If you do mean the 2nd then both you and your wife are TA's. 7 year olds should be enjoying life and learning. Not slaving to keep his clothes clean. Sounds a bit like child abuse to me.", "YTA.", "YTA I don\u2019t have a problem with you teaching your step child to do laundry but making the kid do all of their own laundry is too much! Make exceptions so the kid can spend time with their mom!", "YATAH. 7 is too young to do the laundry. If his mother goes MIA and is not consistent you shouldn\u2019t stop him from talking to her. He is still a little boy and you are punishing by taking away time with his mother. This is just bad parenting.", "YTA\n\nHe's seven. SEVEN. What seven year old is capable of doing laundry?? Laundry detergents are full of harmful chemicals, and I've definitely known 7yos who still put most things in their mouths! And you're punishing him by removing all stimulus and refusing him contact with his mother for not doing laundry? \n\nThat's abusive. It's cruel. I sincerely hope the mother calls CPS and goes for custody, because you two are monstrous for treating a child like that. And he is a child, a very young child. Teaching children the necessity of chores is important. Teaching them to safely do those chores at an appropriate age is important. Treating a 7yo like this? Nope, that's unacceptable.", "YTA. I'm 32 years old, married and a homeowner. Plenty of times I set a goal to get my laundry done and I don't meet it. I don't punish myself by not doing anything enjoyable, that's a shitty cycle to get into.", "YTA Evil stepmother. Did you learn anything from Disney?!", "YTA\n\nRegardless of anything else, chores are not to buy time with your parents. Punishments should not involve losing time with a parent.", "YTA-while I think it is appropriate for him to have some chores to do, I don\u2019t agree with him having to do his own laundry.  Keeping his room neat and tidy is appropriate but I have questions about him doing his own laundry. What does that entail?  Do you expect him to have his dirty clothes in the hamper or perhaps taken to the laundry room?  Do you really expect him to wash and dry his own clothes. You are leaving some information out here.   Until you clear up these questions, the YTA stands. I think you are asking too much of a 7 year old.", "YTA 7 is really early imo. I don\u2019t even think i could get clothes off the counter at that age lol let em be a child for a few more years", "YTA. It's fine for you to get him to do chores. But you prevented him from spending time with his bio mom and that's just petty. For better or worse it sounds like you don't like your stepson and are overly strict. Also the kid is 7. Cut him some slack. I'm in my 40s and I occasionally get lazy about laundry.", "YTA - Not for him having chores. I was doing laundry by the time I was 7 too, and I don't really think that's a big deal. Honestly, it was doing the dishes that young that I had a problem with. But where I think you went wrong is that this is his mother, not a friend. If it was something that happened every week, I would get your saying no or setting a specific day. But he hadn't seen his mother in a while, and while I get that this is her fault, it's not his fault and he should be able to see his mother the few chances that he gets.", "YTA - Having some tasks for a younger child to do is good to help them become responsible.\n\nBeing totally inflexible and rigid with them is an asshole move, especially if it impacts their relationship with a parent.", "I\u2019m shocked at these responses. NTA all the way. My younger kid is 10 and has been putting away his laundry for years. Putting away laundry (really the hardest part of \u201cdoing\u201d it since putting it in the washer or moving to the dryer can hardly count as a chore) and cleaning his room are not unreasonable chores for a 7 year old to do. He\u2019s not scrubbing a bathroom or doing all the dishes", "You are a terrible step parent. He is going to resent you if he doesn\u2019t already.", "YTA\n\nYou're too inflexible.

I have a 12 year old and all he does is the dishwasher and takes out the recycling into the big bin for collection and both of those have only been for the past 2 years. Obviously keeping his own room tidy is up to him as well, but you've put too much responsibility on a 7 yo. He should bring his washing over, or put in the washing bin, as and when needed but to do his washing himself is too much.\nYTA", "YTA and so is your husband. \n\nFrom someone who had a lot of responsibilities at a young age like him, I easily got overwhelmed and became really resentful. Obviously he can't seem to get it all done, so there's a problem. Yes, he's a kid and should clean his room but he does need help. His laundry? Do it for him- have him sort out the colors and teach him how to put those clothes away once they are folded. And to hold his mother over his head until he is done with his chores is a whole different type of cruelty. You and your husband are so wicked.", "I am al for age appropriate chores, doing is laundry at 7 isn't something I would do.  I am going to say NTA, you have a schedule, for a reason.  It sounds like his mother is the one who cannot keep to any sort of schedule with your step son.  Watching a movie and not talking is not an engaging activity.  Good grief!!   I would consider setting up scheduled remote visitations, this way you can still plan life around Mom.  If she can't adhere to it, that is on her, she has absolutely no right to expect that she can phone in at any time for whatever she wants.", "NTA- All of the Y-TA comments must be from teenagers. It\u2019s completely age appropriate to have a seven year old clean their own room and do their laundry. My two year old helps clean her room and helps with laundry. If she is two, a seven year old can easily do these tasks themselves. People forget that children used to work full time jobs 150 years ago. It\u2019s not robbing them of a childhood to expect them to take care of their rooms and belongings. Being consistent with the expectations is better for his development than making a bunch of exceptions. Also, you aren\u2019t denying them time together. Bio-Mom wants to bank up good mom points by watching a movie together without actually having to interact with son. Talking while he does his chores IS better quality time than sitting in silence watching a movie. Keep up the consistent expectations. You are raising a responsible young man!", "Nta.  Disney Mom doesn't care about raising her own kid, his schedule, or his responsibilities, but she wants to watch movies whenever she likes?  Nope.\n\nAlso, it is WILD how many people here are shitting themselves over the idea of having to do laundry.  Pick up cloth.  Throw cloth in washing bucket.  Turn a dial and push a button.

She asked if they could do it tomorrow instead and my husband said thats fine as long as he gets his room cleaned first. \n\nShe got upset and said that it's ridiculous that we are even expecting a seven year old to do his own laundry and clean his own room and that we should \"let him have fun and be a kid.\" She also said it's not fair that we are \"stopping them from spending time together.\" For the record, we have tried to set up regular times for them to do things like this together, but after a couple of weeks she will stop doing the scheduled calls. Sometimes she goes a few weeks without any contact at all. This is one of those instances when she hasn't been in contact for weeks and now all the sudden she wants to do something with him right now. They don't even talk during a movie, so really him talking to her in the phone while he does his chores would actually give them more bonding time.\n\nAre we wrong for expecting our seven year old to do his chores before doing extra \"fun\" activities during the week, even if they are with his mom?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was definitely doing my own laundry and was in charge of cleaning up my own room in high school (amongst other chores). It's mind boggling to me that some parents think their teens are incapable of doing the bare minimum. They're coddling and doing them a disservice.", "Sorry if this sounds harsh but you are doing them zero favours by not instilling responsibility and routine when it comes to doing their own chores. They will be at a disadvantage if they move out and haven't gotten used to doing those basic tasks. You showing them how to do it one time and then continuing to physically do it for them means they won't have that innate instinct of \"O I need to do my laundry\". All they have right now is \"mommy does my laundry.\" Which will never help them when they leave your home...", "The details and extent of the chores *are* 150% important. Children are capable of working in coal mines or even serving tables at a restaurant. But there\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t allow *either* anymore. A child should be a child - not a laborer. Having a 7yo fold their own laundry or put away their toys is totally fine, but this rigidity is absurd.", "Thank god", "Seriously? I asked his mom, she said she washes all family clothes together so she doesn't know the exact proportion, but the 7yo clothes after being folded doesn't take that much place so she is not sure.", "Would it be such a big deal to let him spend time with his mother? This seems very petty to keep him from spending time with his mother. The chores will be there and spending time with his mother is more important. This seems time sensitive.", "He is 7 no laundry is more important than time with his parents", "He's fucking 7 !?! Are you going to ask him to make himself dinner next ? \n\nCleaning his room is age appropriate chores, but he's still a kid. Why do you want him to grow up so fast and act like a fucking adult ?", "I don't think he's too young to do his own laundry, but as the designated laundry-doer in my house, I have to ask... Is this efficient? I feel like if we implemented this in our house, the laundry would just take longer to get done over washing everyone's stuff together.", "NTA when you're a parent you have to learn how to be a parent it's not perfect all the time but as long as you try your best and ask for help or advice you're still a good parent\n\nGood luck and don't fuck it up", "It is when you\u2019re 7 and it\u2019s your Mom.", "Unfortunately though, it\u2019s all she\u2019s willing to provide. They can\u2019t make his mom actually parent.", "If everyone's clothes are washed together, I'd expect her to help with laundry or do her share of other household chores. Maybe she does? But you didn't mention it.", "She could do her own clothes. Or do the whole family\u2019s, who cares? Laundry is not hard.", "For all we know, that is all OP is requiring.  Whatever it is, \"doesn't take long\" two days a week.  So I'm guessing less than 4 hours, maybe less than 2 hours a week.\n\nThe general guidelines would be for a 12yo to be able to \"do laundry\" in the sense of doing it for the whole household and ruining clothes.  Just guessing, but I'd say if the kid is doing \"his laundry\" then it's all his and nothing can really get ruined.  Putting it in the washer takes 2 minutes.  2 minutes to move it into the dryer.  So that's an extra 4 minutes of work compared to what is \"acceptable\" at 6-10, which is \"folding and putting away their own laundry.\" \n\nPerhaps the problem here is my age.  I'm 60 and I was doing chores when I was 6, and yes I labored on a farm, if doing a few hours of weeding the garden a week counts as being a laborer.  Still had plenty of time to be a kid, just like this one.", "No I mean I\u2019m on your side! Folding/putting away his own clothes is no biggie imo", "Then he can talk with his mom while he does laundry, and still get time with her. Even better in fact, since they'd actually be talking instead of silently watching a movie. The kid is not being denied time with his mother.", "If you bothered to read what I typed you\u2019d see that she actually does the hardest/longest part.", "To level with you, I\u2019m in my 20s and raised livestock in my adolescence. I had my share of chores too. However, I wasn\u2019t under an extremely rigid schedule to do these things and wasn\u2019t scrutinized for not doing it exactly when my step-mother told me to do so. I especially wasn\u2019t *kept from my own mother* when not having fulfilled my obligations. I guess it\u2019s not necessarily about the labor but rather being forced to do the labor under a step-mother\u2019s \u201cwhenever I say so\u201d basis. It\u2019s unnecessarily controlling behavior that will only bite the stepmom in the ass in her old age when the child grows to resent her.", "Or he can do his laundry after he talks to his mom he\u2019s 7 years old he should not be expected to multitask like that", "Livestock and pets definitely need to be fed and cared for on a schedule.  You don't just feed the chickens twice on Tuesday because you didn't feel like doing it on Monday.\n\nI don't think it's fair to say the child is being kept from their mother.  OP agreed to let mom talk to the child, but that wasn't good enough for the mom.  What she didn't agree to was allowing the child to watch a movie before the chores were done. \n\nI agree OP is more strict than average--and maybe too strict.  And I agree with your prognosis.   But I don't think it falls into AH category.  The amount of chores is not excessive, and every kid is different when it comes to procrastination vs. motivation."]}
