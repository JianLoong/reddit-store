{"id": 3800, "submission_id": "zb0wpp", "title": "WIBTA if I don't allow my daughter to come with the family on vacation?", "selftext": "I have 5 kids, 3 with my first wife (22f, 16m, 16f) and 2 with my current wife (8m, 6m). We are planning a two week trip to the dominican republic in spring of next year. My wife and I are paying for the youngest 4 obviously but as my daughter is an adult with a full-time job I expected her to pay for her own part of the trip. This is by far the most expensive holiday we've ever been on and have been saving up for it for a couple years. She only pays \u00a3300/m for rent and utilities at her mom's house and shouldn't have any other large expenses as her car has been paid off for a year.\n\nWhen I told her she would be paying most of her own trip she initially agreed and didn't have a problem with it. A week ago I was confirming dates and prices with her before I booked and she decided that she no longer wanted to pay for the trip. I only wanted her to pay \u00a31400 for the trip about 600 less than the price per person. I understand it's expensive for a young adult but she had previously agreed knowing this is what I would expect her to pay and said she was saving for the trip. I also told her she didn't need to pay me all in one go but that I needed at least \u00a3700 from her before I book the trip and she could pay the rest within a year. I think this is reasonable.\n\nI've put off booking the holiday for the time being in the hopes she'll come around. I've told her that if she doesn't agree to pay then the rest of the family will still go without her and she'll miss out. She thinks it's unfair that she has to pay when I'm paying for the rest of kids (they're children). She pointed out we never went on a vacation like this when she was still a child (we mostly did caravan holidays in UK/france) and I'm therefore giving her siblings experiences she never got. She also says her friend's parents still pay for them to go on holiday with their family. My younger daughter is also upset about the possibility of going without her sister and says it will ruin the holiday for her.\n\nMy ex-wife also thinks I'm being unreasonable as she agrees with our daughter about her not having the same experiences as the younger kids because we had less money when she was younger. My daughters step-dad has offered to pay me the initial \u00a3700 but I feel weird about taking money from him.\n\nAs an adult I really think my daughter she take on the responsibility for paying for herself but WIBTA if I don't let her come if she continues to refuse?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm paying around 11k for this trip which is roughly a quarter of my yearly income. I wanted my daughter to pay \u00a31400 which is maybe 6% of her yearly income. And yes she does only have minimal expenses, \u00a3300 for rent is nothing where we live and she couldn't rent a bedsit for double the price. A large percentage of her income is disposable and she saves lots living at home. Bare in mind I have a mortgage, soaring electric & gas bills, as well as 4 minors to provide for. She's had 9 months to save 700 but didn't even need to because she already had more than \u00a3700 saved 9 months ago. She now has another year to get me the other \u00a3700 and I had no plans about being that strict about payback. This summer she went with friends for a few days to disneyland paris, I paid \u00a3300 towards this trip as a her birthday gift. This summer when we went on a cheap holiday to cornwall, I paid for all her expenses then.\n\nMy daughter helped plan this trip from the start and we democratically chose almost every aspect as a family and she knew from the start how much I expected her to cover for this holiday. If she had said this didn't work for her, I could of picked different/cheaper holiday.\n\nThe assumption that my daughter is regularly being treated unfairly to her siblings is not accurate. When I was her age, I was already her father and working 2 jobs (happily) to provide a good quality of life for my daughter and her mother. I am happy that my daughter's young adult life is more carefree than mine got to be. If she was struggling financially or even just living on her own paying rent/bills I would never ask her to pay this much for a trip.\n\nAnd yeah, I have weird feelings about my daughters step-dad for alway refusing to be the bad guy and let our daughter learn to be more responsible.", "created_utc": 1670022206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb0wpp/wibta_if_i_dont_allow_my_daughter_to_come_with/", "score": 878, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Look, if she was spending that much of her own money (more than 2 months rent!) to go on a vacation with her friends it would be irresponsible. Why on earth is it ok for her to spend it to go with family?!  Most kids that age don\u2019t even really want to go on vacation with their parents and little siblings.", "YTA.  22 is young to be funding an overseas trip.  If she never got a trip when younger, you have the money now, AND you're paying for everyone else; take the kid.

Now that the money is there, you're going to pay for everybody else to go, except that you're going to expect her to pay for her own share of the vacation. Yeah, yta. I understand that there was a conversation about it, which does kind of make her suck a little bit, but the fact that you would even have that expectation of her for something that if you do not take her now she will never get to enjoy in her life, is pretty messed up. It's not like she's in her thirties with some great career, she's freaking 22. At the very least you can suck it up and pay for one vacation for her.", "YTA for the simple fact that you never took her on anything equivalent when she was a child. You are favoring the younger siblings and she is getting the short end of the stick because she is the oldest.", "Yta. You have no qualms about taking money from your bio child.

At 22 most people would be independent and covering their own expenses. But I do think if step dad is offering to pay for half I would accept that, that\u2019s their choice to fund it.

We are planning a two week trip to the dominican republic in spring of next year. My wife and I are paying for the youngest 4 obviously but as my daughter is an adult with a full-time job I expected her to pay for her own part of the trip. This is by far the most expensive holiday we've ever been on and have been saving up for it for a couple years. She only pays \u00a3300/m for rent and utilities at her mom's house and shouldn't have any other large expenses as her car has been paid off for a year. \n\nWhen I told her she would be paying most of her own trip she initially agreed and didn't have a problem with it. A week ago I was confirming dates and prices with her before I booked and she decided that she no longer wanted to pay for the trip. I only wanted her to pay \u00a31400 for the trip about 600 less than the price per person. I understand it's expensive for a young adult but she had previously agreed knowing this is what I would expect her to pay and said she was saving for the trip. I also told her she didn't need to pay me all in one go but that I needed at least \u00a3700 from her before I book the trip and she could pay the rest within a year. I think this is reasonable.\n\nI've put off booking the holiday for the time being in the hopes she'll come around. I've told her that if she doesn't agree to pay then the rest of the family will still go without her and she'll miss out. She thinks it's unfair that she has to pay when I'm paying for the rest of kids (they're children). She pointed out we never went on a vacation like this when she was still a child (we mostly did caravan holidays in UK/france) and I'm therefore giving her siblings experiences she never got. She also says her friend's parents still pay for them to go on holiday with their family. My younger daughter is also upset about the possibility of going without her sister and says it will ruin the holiday for her. \n\nMy ex-wife also thinks I'm being unreasonable as she agrees with our daughter about her not having the same experiences as the younger kids because we had less money when she was younger. My daughters step-dad has offered to pay me the initial \u00a3700 but I feel weird about taking money from him. \n\nAs an adult I really think my daughter she take on the responsibility for paying for herself but WIBTA if I don't let her come if she continues to refuse?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then, when someone who clearly cares about your daughter and wants her to be able to have experiences that will be memorable to her offers to pay the portion you're asking for, you shut that down.

If she is ever to have hope of fully leaving the nest, she\u2019s doing everything right from what I can see.  \n\nShe\u2019s not acting spoiled here. It\u2019s a family vacation and she\u2019s just asking to be treated like family and not like a friend of the family.  Hell, even my husband\u2019s parents included me in on family vacations for free when I was just a girlfriend of a couple of years.  I offered to pay my way and they declined.  I even tried to treat them to dinner as thanks and they insisted I was, for the purposes of the trip, family.  \n\nThere will be other vacations where she can cover her own costs and it can be counted as fair for an adult. But this sounds like a once in a lifetime family event that she should be part of along with her siblings.", "Yta you won't take step dads money but you'll take your daughters money?  She's 22, OP your time to 'let our daughter learn to be more responsible' ended several years ago.  She's an adult, who you are asking to pay.  Her step dad, who loves her and doesn't want her to miss a trip with her family *is offering to pay*\n\nTake the money or don't but realize it you don't, and she can't afford to go with you after all, she won't forget it.", "YTA. Yes,  at 22, she's an adult, but she's not established in her career and may not be making lots of money, just like you when she was younger. \n\nPlus,  isn't the purpose of taking vacations with faculty to spend time with them and have a shared experience? It sounds like that's something that you aren't interested in,  at least with her.", "YTA. If you\u2019re naive enough to spend a quarter of your salary on a VACATION then pony up the extra money for your oldest. And hope she doesn\u2019t take after you in terms of fiscal priorities and habits.", "I don't see any comments acknowledging the daughter was part of the planning process and agreed to that payment. Also he's not asking her to pay her entire way, just a portion.\nI'm still kind of on the fence, like there's more to the story, but at least understand where he's coming from (somewhat, my kids are still young).\nMore info might provide context (did she pay that car off herself or her parents, are there other big bills she's responsible for?).", "I couldn\u2019t help but read this entire passage with \u201cFamily\u201d in air quotes\u2026 \nOP, hate to break it to you but YTA.", "Lmao \"the kids that have no bills\" you mean the children who cant work?!? What world do you live in", "This Thread just really opens up the differences in rental costs. My rent is $2,465 a month, to see someone on here say that $1,400 is worth 5 months of rent, is insane to me. I could only dream of a place that's renting that low, and if I actually live there I'd probably get murdered.", "This was the first thing I thought too. Forgetting the whole daughter situation, saving for years to spend a quarter of year income sounds so foolish. No wonder he\u2019s looking to see where he can cut expenses.", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll this far to see this mentioned. I\u2019m freaking out about spending what will end up being 8-10k on a family vacation that has family significance for my wife\u2019s father next summer and I make 3x what he makes and my wife makes an additional ~20k.", "How the hell was he suppose to take her somewhere if he couldn't afford it? Unfortunately he couldn't afford a trip like this back then but he can now. On top of that she can afford a trip like this too. She already agreed to pay so why is she changing her mind now? \n\nBlaming the dad for not being able to afford a big trip when she was younger is beyond stupid. His daughter is entitled and just sounds jealous that her younger siblings  are able to grow up with more money than when she was growing up. My parents definitely had more money when my sister's were growing up than they did when I was younger. Shes not getting the short end of the stick. She is an adult who has a job where she makes enough to save money. \n\nUnpopular but Dad's NTA simply for the fact that she originally agreed to pay and had no problem with it and  then changed her mind", "So what's your logic here? OP's younger kids don't get to go on this vacation because the eldest didn't get a similar experience or is he TA because he was struggling when the eldest was younger?", "Yes, you would think he would relish the opportunity to offer this experience when he couldn\u2019t before YTA", "Wow\u2014-I thought this dude was TA but reading now now summed it up, he is MOST DEFINITELY THE ASSHOLE!", "Wait, so does this mean parents are now responsible for funding family vacations indefinitely? Will they be responsible for funding in-laws and grandchildren, too? Chances are high that some will be married with kids before the 6 year old leaves home.", "This needs to be higher. A lot of main comments haven't been about willingness to step up as a father by the step father, only in the threads. OP is a giant YTA.", "The other thing in this is that it\u2019s his dream holiday and all the parameters are set by him. It\u2019s not like she could choose the cheaper flight or the cheaper hotel. It\u2019s the holiday he wants but at her cost. He is the AH.", "I had to scroll down way to mych for this. OP I feel like you are trying to teach your daughter responsibility and wanted to save money for this trip herself, something she has already agreed on. However she now feels singled out and if you continue refusing other solutions you WBTAH.\n\nTalk to your daughter, explain what you wanted and then pay yourself or let her stepdad pay, afterall, don't you want her to go with you as well?", "And it's \u00a31,400 not $1,400. That's about $1,700 in US currency. That's worse. And Step-Dad is willing to pay. Not a good look.", "Oh what is this absolute rubbish", "Because he is asking her to fund her holiday as a financially independent adult?\n\nNo contact over that? JFC, it doesn't much to upset you does it?", "Yeah OP is crying poor:\n\n> Bare in mind I have a mortgage, soaring electric & gas bills, as well as 4 minors to provide for.\n\n...to justify excluding his daughter. Yet apparently he's not so poor that he can't pay for all his other kids to go on an expensive vacation.", "This comment needs to rank higher. It'll breed resentment and spoil their relationship.", "Also... his second oldest kids are 16 and are both also old enough to work?\n\nWhy do they get a free ride?", "Daughter has had 9 months to save for this trip. Her paying her own way was not a last minute decision.\nEdit: NTA", "And let's not forget that when he was daughter's age, he was already a father to 2. Like that is the goal everyone should shoot for...", "It\u2019s a little far fetched to say he isn\u2019t a real father based on one post. Being a terrible one I couldn\u2019t argue you on that lol", "Bet a lot of these people were talking about legal responsibility of the dad when the 17 year old moved out the other day.", "OP said she pays 300 to her mom.", "She\u2019s living with her mum, not in a rental.", "They haven't been planning it for 4 years. She's 22. She's been an adult the entire time its been planned.", "She has to pay 1400, that\u2019s more like 120 a month.", "My guess is 'oh no... If I accept it then she' ll appreciate that guy even more and not learn the lesson I imagine I'm teaching here'", "For me it was the part where he doesn't want to accept money from the step dad.", "Yep. My brother has gone on more bigger family trips because we had more money as I got older. I don't begrudge him that and until he was an adult/almost an adult (he's much younger) my parents offered for me to join and offered to pay for me for family vacations. I have turned down and paid for other parts of the trip since I was a gainfully employed adult to thank them and pay part of my way because I can, but they never made me feel excluded like OP is doing to his *young* responsible adult daughter.", "F*cking THANK YOU! Reading all the comments calling OP T A are infuriating because they indicate a distinct lack of reading comprehension, but that's Reddit for you, I guess! \n\nBut seriously, OP was being more than reasonable here. He didn't even demand 100% upfront! Only half!  And the other half he clarified could be paid back over the course of an entire year! He even goes on to say that he wouldn't be a stickler about it and might've even given her more time if she needed it. The edit he gave more than justified his position. NTA, OP!", "Largely agree!\n\nThough I would say that it doesn't quite seem like the daughter is acting entitled. Perhaps I need to read it again, but there doesn't seem like quite enough information to draw that conclusion.\n\nI do think it seems like some jealousy caught up with her though. She might have felt fine about it all at first. Especially if she had agreed to paying a certain amount of her cost and was contributing to the planning, which affected that cost. Then she looked back and the cost and/or jealousy caught up with her.\n\nShe is 22 and her nearest aged siblings are 16. This might well be the first time she's had to truly face the financial differences in upbringing that can come with being the oldest child of people who were young parents. All while being a young adult now herself. She could well be torn between wanting the responsibility and privilege of engaging with things as an adult and realization that her younger siblings are growing up in different financial circumstances than she did. Which will mean they have access to experiences she didn't.", "I completely agree with you! It\u2019s mind boggling how many people are agreeing with the daughter here.", "I do not understand the downvotes", "He\u2019s also pissed that step-dad totally owned him.", "Exactly", "And he had these five or six kids optionally! Don\u2019t have kids if you can\u2019t afford to treat them fairly.", "Yep, those are adult responsibilities that come with having a family!", "Is the current wife not contributing to the holiday?", "At what age does OP stop paying for a child? At 22 I was out of college and paying rent, I would never expect my parents to pay for my vacation\u2026even a family vacation.", "Because they're still kids living at home and in school. Kinda how that works for most of the western world.", "I don\u2019t know her income but 1400 in 9 months could be quite a lot? Comparing to the other trip is strange because he could have put the 300 towards that?", "Excuse me WTF. I was on the fence about this for a few reasons leaning to ESH but reading that. The dad is clearly just a bad father who does not care about what is actually good for his kids.", "This. My parents had me at 16 then had my other siblings at 24/25. I watched them grow up with so much more stability and could do so much more then I ever did\n\nIt\u2019s bittersweet but I am so so happy to see my younger sibs thrive. I stumbled a bit but I got there as well", "Yea I was so p*ssed off when I commented that. It just sounds like a lot of spoiled children in half the comments. Especially the ones saying op is favoring his younger kids for taking them on a lavish vacation as a kid when he didnt do that for his oldest. Like bro, he didn't have the money back then ???", "I guess I got the entitlement from her saying that she never got to go on trips like this when she was younger and saying that her friends parents still pay for them on trips but I guess jealousy does seem to make the most sense there instead of entitlement", "Man you telling me lol. I had 3 daughters each about 2 yrs apart in age and at one point I had each one pick a MLP character and a Princess that \"belonged\" to that kid and then I could get one of each of those and there would be no more disputes.\n\nI still kind of secretly think of them as Fluttershy-Snow White, Applejack-Belle, and Twilight Sparkle-Cinderella.", "This, but step dad offered bio dad the first 700 and bio dad said no f that she needs to be \"responsible\" for herself. OP is a fucking dick and I'm so glad she has someone like step dad in her life that recognizes she's being left out.", "My parents were meticulous about being fair. When I was young we couldn\u2019t afford vacations. When I was in college they took the rest of the family to Disney. They felt bad that I couldn\u2019t go so they offered a cash equivalent for vacation for me - I went on phish tour. Probably not what they were expecting. After that family vacations were \u201cfamily\u201d and were paid for by our parents. I wasn\u2019t punished b/c I was older than my siblings", "When I was 19 and in college, I went to work at my part time job and soon after arriving, I received a call from my father telling me \u201cwe are on our way to Disney world. Take care of the house.\u201d It was beyond hurtful. Disney is something you plan months in advance, not decide last minute, and they waited to leave until after I\u2019d left the house (I was living with them) so I wouldn\u2019t want to go. They had a great time with my two siblings while I cried at home alone. I have never felt more left out or unloved.

Then it would be 14 times her rent!

From her perspective this is the family trip she always wanted to be a part of but due to being born when her parents were younger and had less money it passed her by.   I think it\u2019s just this one time thing for her.", "When they have been in a stable career type job for 5+ years, bought a house, have enough to independently weather 1 year unemployment, have their own family etc. A 22 year old is getting started in the world and trying to build savings for things like buying a house and car, having an emergency fund etc. I would say she could buy her own souvenirs and provide spending money for herself. Have her contribute by babysitting one night and helping with chores. At her age, if she traveled alone or with peers, she would probably take buses and stay at hostels and yet in order to be part of the family he\u2019s asking her to pay for a luxury experience that she wouldn\u2019t have sought on her own just to be part of the family experience.
