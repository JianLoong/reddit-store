We are planning a two week trip to the dominican republic in spring of next year. My wife and I are paying for the youngest 4 obviously but as my daughter is an adult with a full-time job I expected her to pay for her own part of the trip. This is by far the most expensive holiday we've ever been on and have been saving up for it for a couple years. She only pays \u00a3300/m for rent and utilities at her mom's house and shouldn't have any other large expenses as her car has been paid off for a year. \n\nWhen I told her she would be paying most of her own trip she initially agreed and didn't have a problem with it. A week ago I was confirming dates and prices with her before I booked and she decided that she no longer wanted to pay for the trip. I only wanted her to pay \u00a31400 for the trip about 600 less than the price per person. I understand it's expensive for a young adult but she had previously agreed knowing this is what I would expect her to pay and said she was saving for the trip. I also told her she didn't need to pay me all in one go but that I needed at least \u00a3700 from her before I book the trip and she could pay the rest within a year. I think this is reasonable.\n\nI've put off booking the holiday for the time being in the hopes she'll come around. I've told her that if she doesn't agree to pay then the rest of the family will still go without her and she'll miss out. She thinks it's unfair that she has to pay when I'm paying for the rest of kids (they're children). She pointed out we never went on a vacation like this when she was still a child (we mostly did caravan holidays in UK/france) and I'm therefore giving her siblings experiences she never got. She also says her friend's parents still pay for them to go on holiday with their family. My younger daughter is also upset about the possibility of going without her sister and says it will ruin the holiday for her. \n\nMy ex-wife also thinks I'm being unreasonable as she agrees with our daughter about her not having the same experiences as the younger kids because we had less money when she was younger. My daughters step-dad has offered to pay me the initial \u00a3700 but I feel weird about taking money from him. \n\nAs an adult I really think my daughter she take on the responsibility for paying for herself but WIBTA if I don't let her come if she continues to refuse?", "created_utc": 1670022206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb0wpp/wibta_if_i_dont_allow_my_daughter_to_come_with/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Look, if she was spending that much of her own money (more than 2 months rent!) to go on a vacation with her friends it would be irresponsible. Why on earth is it ok for her to spend it to go with family?!

If she never got a trip when younger, you have the money now, AND you're paying for everyone else; take the kid.

Now that the money is there, you're going to pay for everybody else to go, except that you're going to expect her to pay for her own share of the vacation. Yeah, yta. I understand that there was a conversation about it, which does kind of make her suck a little bit, but the fact that you would even have that expectation of her for something that if you do not take her now she will never get to enjoy in her life, is pretty messed up. It's not like she's in her thirties with some great career, she's freaking 22. At the very least you can suck it up and pay for one vacation for her.", "YTA for the simple fact that you never took her on anything equivalent when she was a child.

At 22 most people would be independent and covering their own expenses. But I do think if step dad is offering to pay for half I would accept that, that\u2019s their choice to fund it.

We are planning a two week trip to the dominican republic in spring of next year. My wife and I are paying for the youngest 4 obviously but as my daughter is an adult with a full-time job I expected her to pay for her own part of the trip. This is by far the most expensive holiday we've ever been on and have been saving up for it for a couple years. She only pays \u00a3300/m for rent and utilities at her mom's house and shouldn't have any other large expenses as her car has been paid off for a year. \n\nWhen I told her she would be paying most of her own trip she initially agreed and didn't have a problem with it. A week ago I was confirming dates and prices with her before I booked and she decided that she no longer wanted to pay for the trip. I only wanted her to pay \u00a31400 for the trip about 600 less than the price per person. I understand it's expensive for a young adult but she had previously agreed knowing this is what I would expect her to pay and said she was saving for the trip. I also told her she didn't need to pay me all in one go but that I needed at least \u00a3700 from her before I book the trip and she could pay the rest within a year. I think this is reasonable.\n\nI've put off booking the holiday for the time being in the hopes she'll come around. I've told her that if she doesn't agree to pay then the rest of the family will still go without her and she'll miss out. She thinks it's unfair that she has to pay when I'm paying for the rest of kids (they're children). She pointed out we never went on a vacation like this when she was still a child (we mostly did caravan holidays in UK/france) and I'm therefore giving her siblings experiences she never got. She also says her friend's parents still pay for them to go on holiday with their family. My younger daughter is also upset about the possibility of going without her sister and says it will ruin the holiday for her. \n\nMy ex-wife also thinks I'm being unreasonable as she agrees with our daughter about her not having the same experiences as the younger kids because we had less money when she was younger. My daughters step-dad has offered to pay me the initial \u00a3700 but I feel weird about taking money from him. \n\nAs an adult I really think my daughter she take on the responsibility for paying for herself but WIBTA if I don't let her come if she continues to refuse?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And if not, why? Say you planned this about 3 years ago, your oldest would have only been 19.", "Wait, you\u2019ve been saving for years but you gave her 9 months?", "So it has taken you a couple of years to save money for the vacation you chose, but you expect your daughter to have saved enough in 9 months?", "When I was 18 and living 45 minutes away in a dorm, my parents took my two younger siblings to Cancun. I found out when I got a postcard from my sister. When they got back, they said they didn\u2019t invite me because I had to work. This feels so similar and really is awful. It\u2019s been decades and I\u2019ll still probably die mad about it. \n\nOP, YTA. Asking your daughter to pay 5 times her monthly rent for a trip and then refusing her other parents\u2019 money when she clearly can\u2019t pay it is a huge jerk move. Is he trying to punish her??", "Probably both teens if they've got working brains, honestly", "Exactly", "Jenkies or however the hell ot spelled.", "It was around christmas 2020 (so she was 20) when we decided we wanted to go on a big trip in the future and started saving a little each month but we had no solid plans on when, where or how much we were willing to pay at the time. This only became a solid plan 9 months ago.", "He's probably showing her and her bio siblings that they are cannon fodder. When they reach 18 they are no longer his responsibility he's already replaced their mother and them with younger models. \n\nMy dad has 2 children from his 1st marriage. I have an older sister 16 years older than me and 1 a year younger than me. (Don't ask yes I am from his second marriage and the middle child.)  \n\nHe introduced me to my siblings when I was 9. They hated me and him for feeling like I was replacing them. Now they are NC with me due to his actions. Even tho I'd love to have siblings. Luckily my husband and his large family make me feel complete.", "So you had 2 years to save money she had 9 months. Dad of the year award goes to her step dad.", "Honestly, it\u2019s really unrealistic to think that she could afford this trip with only having 9 months to save. I\u2019m 20 and have a well paying full time job, with only one bill (the same amount as your daughter) and it would be impossible for me to save $1400 in 9 months. at least, it would be impossible if i wanted things like food and gas during those 9 months and for a few months after. and honestly, why not accept the money from her stepdad? he obviously cares about her having fun and spending time with her paternal family, but you don\u2019t seem to care about the same things. if you\u2019re uncomfortable accepting money from her stepdad for the trip, you should feel even more uncomfortable taking money from your daughter. YTA", "So she never got a big trip when she was your other kids age. She is just starting out maybe she thought she could try but is staring to learn how expensive money is.\n\nIt\u2019s really unfair her siblings her a free big trip she never got", "So you expect your 22 year old to quickly save enough money to go on vacation with you, her stepmother, and the siblings?\n\nIf the daughter of the OP is reading this, save your money. Go on a holiday you plan and want."]}
