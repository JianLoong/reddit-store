{"id": 3800, "submission_id": "zb0wpp", "title": "WIBTA if I don't allow my daughter to come with the family on vacation?", "selftext": "I have 5 kids, 3 with my first wife (22f, 16m, 16f) and 2 with my current wife (8m, 6m). We are planning a two week trip to the dominican republic in spring of next year. My wife and I are paying for the youngest 4 obviously but as my daughter is an adult with a full-time job I expected her to pay for her own part of the trip. This is by far the most expensive holiday we've ever been on and have been saving up for it for a couple years. She only pays \u00a3300/m for rent and utilities at her mom's house and shouldn't have any other large expenses as her car has been paid off for a year.\n\nWhen I told her she would be paying most of her own trip she initially agreed and didn't have a problem with it. A week ago I was confirming dates and prices with her before I booked and she decided that she no longer wanted to pay for the trip. I only wanted her to pay \u00a31400 for the trip about 600 less than the price per person. I understand it's expensive for a young adult but she had previously agreed knowing this is what I would expect her to pay and said she was saving for the trip. I also told her she didn't need to pay me all in one go but that I needed at least \u00a3700 from her before I book the trip and she could pay the rest within a year. I think this is reasonable.\n\nI've put off booking the holiday for the time being in the hopes she'll come around. I've told her that if she doesn't agree to pay then the rest of the family will still go without her and she'll miss out. She thinks it's unfair that she has to pay when I'm paying for the rest of kids (they're children). She pointed out we never went on a vacation like this when she was still a child (we mostly did caravan holidays in UK/france) and I'm therefore giving her siblings experiences she never got. She also says her friend's parents still pay for them to go on holiday with their family. My younger daughter is also upset about the possibility of going without her sister and says it will ruin the holiday for her.\n\nMy ex-wife also thinks I'm being unreasonable as she agrees with our daughter about her not having the same experiences as the younger kids because we had less money when she was younger. My daughters step-dad has offered to pay me the initial \u00a3700 but I feel weird about taking money from him.\n\nAs an adult I really think my daughter she take on the responsibility for paying for herself but WIBTA if I don't let her come if she continues to refuse?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm paying around 11k for this trip which is roughly a quarter of my yearly income. I wanted my daughter to pay \u00a31400 which is maybe 6% of her yearly income. And yes she does only have minimal expenses, \u00a3300 for rent is nothing where we live and she couldn't rent a bedsit for double the price. A large percentage of her income is disposable and she saves lots living at home. Bare in mind I have a mortgage, soaring electric & gas bills, as well as 4 minors to provide for. She's had 9 months to save 700 but didn't even need to because she already had more than \u00a3700 saved 9 months ago. She now has another year to get me the other \u00a3700 and I had no plans about being that strict about payback. This summer she went with friends for a few days to disneyland paris, I paid \u00a3300 towards this trip as a her birthday gift. This summer when we went on a cheap holiday to cornwall, I paid for all her expenses then.\n\nMy daughter helped plan this trip from the start and we democratically chose almost every aspect as a family and she knew from the start how much I expected her to cover for this holiday. If she had said this didn't work for her, I could of picked different/cheaper holiday.\n\nThe assumption that my daughter is regularly being treated unfairly to her siblings is not accurate. When I was her age, I was already her father and working 2 jobs (happily) to provide a good quality of life for my daughter and her mother. I am happy that my daughter's young adult life is more carefree than mine got to be. If she was struggling financially or even just living on her own paying rent/bills I would never ask her to pay this much for a trip.\n\nAnd yeah, I have weird feelings about my daughters step-dad for alway refusing to be the bad guy and let our daughter learn to be more responsible.", "created_utc": 1670022206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb0wpp/wibta_if_i_dont_allow_my_daughter_to_come_with/", "score": 3056, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Look, if she was spending that much of her own money (more than 2 months rent!) to go on a vacation with her friends it would be irresponsible. Why on earth is it ok for her to spend it to go with family?!  Most kids that age don\u2019t even really want to go on vacation with their parents and little siblings.", "YTA.  22 is young to be funding an overseas trip.  If she never got a trip when younger, you have the money now, AND you're paying for everyone else; take the kid.

Do you want a family vacation or not?", "YTA -  if her step father is willing to step up where you won\u2019t, why does it matter where the money comes from?

Now that the money is there, you're going to pay for everybody else to go, except that you're going to expect her to pay for her own share of the vacation. Yeah, yta. I understand that there was a conversation about it, which does kind of make her suck a little bit, but the fact that you would even have that expectation of her for something that if you do not take her now she will never get to enjoy in her life, is pretty messed up. It's not like she's in her thirties with some great career, she's freaking 22. At the very least you can suck it up and pay for one vacation for her.", "YTA for the simple fact that you never took her on anything equivalent when she was a child. You are favoring the younger siblings and she is getting the short end of the stick because she is the oldest.", "Yta. You have no qualms about taking money from your bio child.

At 22 most people would be independent and covering their own expenses. But I do think if step dad is offering to pay for half I would accept that, that\u2019s their choice to fund it.

We are planning a two week trip to the dominican republic in spring of next year. My wife and I are paying for the youngest 4 obviously but as my daughter is an adult with a full-time job I expected her to pay for her own part of the trip. This is by far the most expensive holiday we've ever been on and have been saving up for it for a couple years. She only pays \u00a3300/m for rent and utilities at her mom's house and shouldn't have any other large expenses as her car has been paid off for a year. \n\nWhen I told her she would be paying most of her own trip she initially agreed and didn't have a problem with it. A week ago I was confirming dates and prices with her before I booked and she decided that she no longer wanted to pay for the trip. I only wanted her to pay \u00a31400 for the trip about 600 less than the price per person. I understand it's expensive for a young adult but she had previously agreed knowing this is what I would expect her to pay and said she was saving for the trip. I also told her she didn't need to pay me all in one go but that I needed at least \u00a3700 from her before I book the trip and she could pay the rest within a year. I think this is reasonable.\n\nI've put off booking the holiday for the time being in the hopes she'll come around. I've told her that if she doesn't agree to pay then the rest of the family will still go without her and she'll miss out. She thinks it's unfair that she has to pay when I'm paying for the rest of kids (they're children). She pointed out we never went on a vacation like this when she was still a child (we mostly did caravan holidays in UK/france) and I'm therefore giving her siblings experiences she never got. She also says her friend's parents still pay for them to go on holiday with their family. My younger daughter is also upset about the possibility of going without her sister and says it will ruin the holiday for her. \n\nMy ex-wife also thinks I'm being unreasonable as she agrees with our daughter about her not having the same experiences as the younger kids because we had less money when she was younger. My daughters step-dad has offered to pay me the initial \u00a3700 but I feel weird about taking money from him. \n\nAs an adult I really think my daughter she take on the responsibility for paying for herself but WIBTA if I don't let her come if she continues to refuse?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then, when someone who clearly cares about your daughter and wants her to be able to have experiences that will be memorable to her offers to pay the portion you're asking for, you shut that down.

It\u2019s a family vacation and she\u2019s just asking to be treated like family and not like a friend of the family.  Hell, even my husband\u2019s parents included me in on family vacations for free when I was just a girlfriend of a couple of years.  I offered to pay my way and they declined.  I even tried to treat them to dinner as thanks and they insisted I was, for the purposes of the trip, family.  \n\nThere will be other vacations where she can cover her own costs and it can be counted as fair for an adult.

And yet I was able to fund holidays for myself, even saving \u00a33000 in less than a year to go to New Zealand.

OP is out of touch thinking his daughter could afford something like that. It\u2019s a lot for a young adult who\u2019s just started saving. She\u2019s probably just saved enough that she feels she has a safety net. She\u2019s also seeing first hand, for the first time, how slowly savings go up and how quickly spending money disappears.
