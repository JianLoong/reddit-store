{"id": 3800, "submission_id": "zb0wpp", "title": "WIBTA if I don't allow my daughter to come with the family on vacation?", "selftext": "I have 5 kids, 3 with my first wife (22f, 16m, 16f) and 2 with my current wife (8m, 6m). We are planning a two week trip to the dominican republic in spring of next year. My wife and I are paying for the youngest 4 obviously but as my daughter is an adult with a full-time job I expected her to pay for her own part of the trip. This is by far the most expensive holiday we've ever been on and have been saving up for it for a couple years. She only pays \u00a3300/m for rent and utilities at her mom's house and shouldn't have any other large expenses as her car has been paid off for a year.\n\nWhen I told her she would be paying most of her own trip she initially agreed and didn't have a problem with it. A week ago I was confirming dates and prices with her before I booked and she decided that she no longer wanted to pay for the trip. I only wanted her to pay \u00a31400 for the trip about 600 less than the price per person. I understand it's expensive for a young adult but she had previously agreed knowing this is what I would expect her to pay and said she was saving for the trip. I also told her she didn't need to pay me all in one go but that I needed at least \u00a3700 from her before I book the trip and she could pay the rest within a year. I think this is reasonable.\n\nI've put off booking the holiday for the time being in the hopes she'll come around. I've told her that if she doesn't agree to pay then the rest of the family will still go without her and she'll miss out. She thinks it's unfair that she has to pay when I'm paying for the rest of kids (they're children). She pointed out we never went on a vacation like this when she was still a child (we mostly did caravan holidays in UK/france) and I'm therefore giving her siblings experiences she never got. She also says her friend's parents still pay for them to go on holiday with their family. My younger daughter is also upset about the possibility of going without her sister and says it will ruin the holiday for her.\n\nMy ex-wife also thinks I'm being unreasonable as she agrees with our daughter about her not having the same experiences as the younger kids because we had less money when she was younger. My daughters step-dad has offered to pay me the initial \u00a3700 but I feel weird about taking money from him.\n\nAs an adult I really think my daughter she take on the responsibility for paying for herself but WIBTA if I don't let her come if she continues to refuse?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm paying around 11k for this trip which is roughly a quarter of my yearly income. I wanted my daughter to pay \u00a31400 which is maybe 6% of her yearly income. And yes she does only have minimal expenses, \u00a3300 for rent is nothing where we live and she couldn't rent a bedsit for double the price. A large percentage of her income is disposable and she saves lots living at home. Bare in mind I have a mortgage, soaring electric & gas bills, as well as 4 minors to provide for. She's had 9 months to save 700 but didn't even need to because she already had more than \u00a3700 saved 9 months ago. She now has another year to get me the other \u00a3700 and I had no plans about being that strict about payback. This summer she went with friends for a few days to disneyland paris, I paid \u00a3300 towards this trip as a her birthday gift. This summer when we went on a cheap holiday to cornwall, I paid for all her expenses then.\n\nMy daughter helped plan this trip from the start and we democratically chose almost every aspect as a family and she knew from the start how much I expected her to cover for this holiday. If she had said this didn't work for her, I could of picked different/cheaper holiday.\n\nThe assumption that my daughter is regularly being treated unfairly to her siblings is not accurate. When I was her age, I was already her father and working 2 jobs (happily) to provide a good quality of life for my daughter and her mother. I am happy that my daughter's young adult life is more carefree than mine got to be. If she was struggling financially or even just living on her own paying rent/bills I would never ask her to pay this much for a trip.\n\nAnd yeah, I have weird feelings about my daughters step-dad for alway refusing to be the bad guy and let our daughter learn to be more responsible.", "created_utc": 1670022206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb0wpp/wibta_if_i_dont_allow_my_daughter_to_come_with/", "score": 480, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Look, if she was spending that much of her own money (more than 2 months rent!) to go on a vacation with her friends it would be irresponsible. Why on earth is it ok for her to spend it to go with family?!  Most kids that age don\u2019t even really want to go on vacation with their parents and little siblings.", "YTA.  22 is young to be funding an overseas trip.  If she never got a trip when younger, you have the money now, AND you're paying for everyone else; take the kid.

Now that the money is there, you're going to pay for everybody else to go, except that you're going to expect her to pay for her own share of the vacation. Yeah, yta. I understand that there was a conversation about it, which does kind of make her suck a little bit, but the fact that you would even have that expectation of her for something that if you do not take her now she will never get to enjoy in her life, is pretty messed up. It's not like she's in her thirties with some great career, she's freaking 22. At the very least you can suck it up and pay for one vacation for her.", "YTA for the simple fact that you never took her on anything equivalent when she was a child. You are favoring the younger siblings and she is getting the short end of the stick because she is the oldest.", "Yta. You have no qualms about taking money from your bio child.

At 22 most people would be independent and covering their own expenses. But I do think if step dad is offering to pay for half I would accept that, that\u2019s their choice to fund it.

We are planning a two week trip to the dominican republic in spring of next year. My wife and I are paying for the youngest 4 obviously but as my daughter is an adult with a full-time job I expected her to pay for her own part of the trip. This is by far the most expensive holiday we've ever been on and have been saving up for it for a couple years. She only pays \u00a3300/m for rent and utilities at her mom's house and shouldn't have any other large expenses as her car has been paid off for a year. \n\nWhen I told her she would be paying most of her own trip she initially agreed and didn't have a problem with it. A week ago I was confirming dates and prices with her before I booked and she decided that she no longer wanted to pay for the trip. I only wanted her to pay \u00a31400 for the trip about 600 less than the price per person. I understand it's expensive for a young adult but she had previously agreed knowing this is what I would expect her to pay and said she was saving for the trip. I also told her she didn't need to pay me all in one go but that I needed at least \u00a3700 from her before I book the trip and she could pay the rest within a year. I think this is reasonable.\n\nI've put off booking the holiday for the time being in the hopes she'll come around. I've told her that if she doesn't agree to pay then the rest of the family will still go without her and she'll miss out. She thinks it's unfair that she has to pay when I'm paying for the rest of kids (they're children). She pointed out we never went on a vacation like this when she was still a child (we mostly did caravan holidays in UK/france) and I'm therefore giving her siblings experiences she never got. She also says her friend's parents still pay for them to go on holiday with their family. My younger daughter is also upset about the possibility of going without her sister and says it will ruin the holiday for her. \n\nMy ex-wife also thinks I'm being unreasonable as she agrees with our daughter about her not having the same experiences as the younger kids because we had less money when she was younger. My daughters step-dad has offered to pay me the initial \u00a3700 but I feel weird about taking money from him. \n\nAs an adult I really think my daughter she take on the responsibility for paying for herself but WIBTA if I don't let her come if she continues to refuse?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then, when someone who clearly cares about your daughter and wants her to be able to have experiences that will be memorable to her offers to pay the portion you're asking for, you shut that down.

It\u2019s funny how people make it sound okay when they tell you about it because they smile and act reassuring", "I think we are going to see her posts on the narc parent sub referring to him as her \u201cbio-dad\u201d pestering her because she\u2019s \u201cno contact\u201d with him.", "This is I think the most level headed response in the whole comment thread. The daughter is 22, that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable age to be expected to contribute to things like this. She is gainfully employed full time and has limited expenses. Fair enough. \n\nIt is also reasonable for the daughter to determine that this isn\u2019t how she\u2019d like to spend her money. It feels too expensive and she doesn\u2019t want to allocate her savings and earnings towards it. Fair enough. \n\nThe dad has two reasonable options I think. He can accept the fact that she isn\u2019t comfortable spending her money that way and either 1)go without her and recognize that this is in many ways normal, kids stop vacationing with parents when they become adults or 2)pay her way because you value her company more than the extra expense. Those are both valid choices. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t get to NOT pay her way and then also emotionally exploit her because she doesn\u2019t want to pay for it. He made choices and she is allowed to as well.", "Just admit you don\u2019t want her going. It would be a lot less words than all the crap you posted", "Gotta remember that OP gave her an additional year to pay it off, giving her a total of just under 2 years.", "She has had the same amount of time and the final year works out at under \u00a360 a month which is doable.\n\nIf she doesn't want to save or pay then she doesn't need to go.\n\nEdit: your situation at 21 was different. She's still at home and pays her parents \u00a3300 a month which is cheap. If I was step dad I'd have asked and when they agreed I'd have raised the rent by \u00a360pm then they wouldn't be in this situation.", "That\u2019s cool and all for your family. But it doesn\u2019t sound like OP has the means to do that. If he did, I suspect he wouldn\u2019t have posted this and would have just paid her way. \nIt\u2019s fair to expect an adult child to pay something to go on this type of trip if the parents can\u2019t afford it. Where he loses me and becomes the AH is not accepting the SD money for her to go. There\u2019s no shame in family helping family, and the SD is both of their family. So overall soft YTA from me.", "Read the OP's edit. you sound like someone who could find fault with their parents for many, many things\n\ndaughter has known about trip from the start, helped plan it and knew to save\n\ni'll stick with the ESH", "Because her step dad paying for her isn't the point. The point is that she's being told to pay her way or be excluded from a family vacation that all the other siblings are being treated to. Dad has come up with a way to not only exclude her but hold a huge family memory for ransom.  \n\nDo I think he intended for it to read like it does or have the fallout that it does? Probably not. I also wouldn't put it past him to have failed to mention a pre-existing resentment, though. I still think that he qualifies for YTA.", "Brother-In-Law????  No one has a brother in law in this story.", "Ummm... I think they just call that half brother...", "Thanks! He really is focusing on the wrong thing. As the saying goes, he can't see the forest for the trees.", "Nope \u00a31,400...which is $600 less than the normal price. \n\n\nBuddy needs to give his head a shake. Won't take money from the step dad but has no issue taking his daughters.", "She has to pay \u00a3700 up front, and can pay the remaining amount off over the rest of the year.", "TBH I didn't try TOO hard to talk the oldest into changing her mind. There was an attempt. It was a lot of money already.", "I think he wants her to go so she can babysit. That's why he held off buying tickets hoping she would change her mind.", "So she is an adult and can pay for it?", "Exactly this. She probably realizes that, too.", "He is still acting out of spite not letting step father pay. I still disagree with him. But if he wants to damage their relationship oven being petty this is his call.", "I think this Original Poser, er, Poster, intends to exclude his eldest daughter, one way or another. She's an adult, and needs to adult now, and get out of his hair.\n\nThat's my read of what he wrote. I won't write what my wife said about what the OP wrote.\n\nThe OP is YTA", "It does suck that unfortunately she misses out on the free ride due to her age but I think that's just how the world works at times. There are pros and cons of being the eldest. I don't think it's holding the memory ransom, she is allowed to go- she just needs to pay for herself. Its unfortunate that he did not have the money when she was younger to do this. We have to think also does her being an adult free up money that went into child support or any of her other finances as a minor allow him to save for this trip?\n\n I think it would be very nice for op to hold off on the trip longer and save more to cover for daughter. I dont think she is entitled to that however. Truly op needs to get over his weird feelings and take the help from stepdad. If he can't afford the trip for 7 people, it's weird not to take help to cover the 7th person, especially when he wont be putting any money to the 7th person anyways. If its a powerplay, he needs to get over it and realize its not worth the hurt he will put his daughter through. Because let me tell you something op, that shit sits with you forever.", "What age is it reasonable to expect his adult child to contribute to the cost of a group vacation?   25? 30?", "God same shit. This aita post is bringing a lot more pain than I thought id feel. Idk about you but my relationship with them is essentially gone", "Yeah oof $1400\u2026 what good dad asks their 22 year old to spend that money on a vacation? Merry Christmas! Here\u2019s your bankruptcy! /s", "Then let the dad who cares about her pay for the trip. Ridiculous. She's a 22 year old who's only been working for how long? Probably not even earning as much as you. And you had 2 years to save and you gave her 9 months? Smh. Massive YTA", "Man are you definitely not going to win and Dad of the year awards.  You've literally had to years to save as an established adult and your daughter who is literally just starting out in life only had nine months and you don't see how that's unfair and unrealistic especially in today's hyper inflation world?\n\nMan even when I was that age, just out of college with a entry level job, there'd be no way I could save up that much, that fast.\n\nChrist, YTA and completely out of touch.", "Your being cheap will bite you in the butt when she refuses to be around you. You have 5 kids. Pay for 5 kids. Stop being cheap. YTA", "Ok.. I was with you, and then this.....\n\nShe's had 9 months to save, I thought your terms were reasonable only thinking you were TA for not taking money from her SD. But she has had significantly less time to plan and save and was under the impression she would be fully covered for 2 years. Sorry, have to bump you up to fully YTA.", ">Truly op needs to get over his weird feelings and take the help from stepdad. If he can't afford the trip for 7 people, it's weird not to take help to cover the 7th person, especially when he wont be putting any money to the 7th person anyways.\n\nAnd there's the sticky wicket for me. It's not about the money, it's about something else and he just hasn't said what yet. The way he talks about her earnings and bills just feels off. And her not going isn't just impacting her, it's also negatively impacting at least one of the sisters.", "\"Hope you enjoy paying to come and be a babysitter so your stepmother and I can enjoy our vacation\"", "It\u2019s in pounds. Right now, that\u2019s $1722. Even worse.", "\u00a31,400, which is a lot of money! That's 1,722USD.", "It probably revolves around the stepdad and the fact she lives with him and her mother."]}
