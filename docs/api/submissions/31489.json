Am I overreacting?\n\nSo just for some context I\u2019m an American living in Europe and thanksgiving is a very sentimental holiday for me as it\u2019s the one time of year my whole family is together. But, living so far away, I\u2019m not able to be with my family this year. I decided to throw my own dinner and invited about 10 people over to my place to celebrate. Mind you none of these people are American and all of them agreed to come, some even traveling from the other side of the country to join. This means a lot to me because I always get wickedly homesick around this time of year. My boyfriend has work that night until 10 and has a work from home shift the next morning at 8:30. I asked if he would come over for dessert, just for about an hour or to stay over and work from home from my place. He refused both options saying that he\u2019ll be too tired. I know he works a lot and I\u2019m trying not to be too dramatic but it just feels like he isn\u2019t acknowledging how much this means to me. I can\u2019t help but feel a little hurt and angry. I blew up at him a bit the other day about it but felt guilt after onwards so decided to drop it but I can\u2019t help the nagging feeling that he\u2019s not really listening. Am I being dramatic? Or should he just suck it up and come after work? I think I might be the asshole for making a big deal out of something as simple as a work schedule. \n\nTldr: boyfriend has a busy work schedule and can\u2019t come to holiday dinner, I asked if he could come for a little and he refused.\n\nEDIT: Hi guys thanks for the reply\u2019s and opinions. Just to clarify he is also American so he celebrates this holiday as well and understands the significance. I\u2019ve been planning for about a month and he\u2019s said multiple times he would come until this week he said he wouldn\u2019t which is why I got upset. I\u2019ve since apologized for blowing up.", "created_utc": 1700648733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18162gw/aita_for_fighting_with_my_boyfriend_about_coming/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's just a holiday, a social construct, you don't HAVE to celebrate on that day just because everyone else is. Give the guy some breathing room, I imagine he'll be exhausted. Why would you want to spend time with someone who will just be waiting to leave so he can go to bed? You'll just be holding him hostage lol. Doesn't seem like quality time to me.", "YTA.\n\nYou're being dramatic because you are homesick for a holiday and not taking into account others health and wellbeing. It's being selfish. \n\n\"he isn\u2019t acknowledging how much this means to me\", you yourself are not acknowledging that he will be exhausted and needing rest. An hour or two eats away at rest time and staying at yours while you have people over doesn't let him rest for work unless you kick them out straight away. \n\nYour dinner is not essential, working is. You will have your other friends attending, so accept his no without causing drama.", "> Am I being dramatic?\n\nObviously, since you blew up, apologize, if you haven't done it already.", "YTA\n\nThe guy is working until after 10pm and has to be ready to work by 830 the next morning.

He needs to rest, one hour for dessert may seem not much to ask, but he has a short time after work to relax/decompress and sleep and having an early shift next morrning means he can't be tired. A gathering with about ten people can take longer and/or more energy draining than expected. Enjoy your dinner", "YTA It\u2019s not like he simply refuses to come while being available. He has to work till 10PM and from 8.30AM again. He just has a conflicting schedule. Coming over after a full work day, offering up his rest time in between shifts is quite an ask in my opinion. If his presence was that important for you, you should have taken his schedule into account when planning the dinner. You shouldn\u2019t have blown up over this.", "YTA-lite.

He has all freedom to decline. It's not like he pulled an excuse or anything alike. Blowing up on him for *needing to sleep and work* is more than you just being dramatic.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're overreacting, he gets home and has about 90 minutes to shower eat and get ready for bed. That's mentally draining on anyone.", "I feel like its important that his break isn't that long, so if he wants to get a proper 8h sleep he has around like 2h of free time, which looking at it I feel like that's understandable if he wants to not do anything in these 2h.\n\nAnother thing is european culture towards thanksgiving, which (depending on where you live a bit) isn't as big as in america, so that might make it harder for him to relate and understand.\n\nOn the other hand its a sentimental thing for you, so its understandable if you wanna have your bf there with you to celebrate.  \nMaybe a solution would be like him coming over just to eat? I could imagine that part of his refusal is due to him thinking that he'd have to help out with things, which (as mentioned above) doesn't really fit with his work schedule. But maybe promising that its just for dessert and nothing else could help?", "YTA. While Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and I understand how you feel, for your BF it's just a meed-week workday. Save some food for him and eat it on the weekend.", "YTA.\n\nBoyfriend has a heavy workload that week.  He could care less about Thanksgiving. \n\nBe a big girl and do your own thing.

Did you ask your partner to take time off (which is also a big, inconsiderate, ask)? If you wanted him there, you needed to communicate far better than what is illustrated here.", "YTA \nBut not a mean one. \n\nHowever,  you are wanting him to validate your feelings and he quite literally doesn't have room in his schedule to do it to your demands. \n\nYou have 10 guests! Let their presence validate your feelings. Apologize to him for being unreasonable.", "YTA. He isn't blowing off your plans to go drinking with the boys.

Your bf works until 10pm, even if it is a work from home shift he won't be out the door immediately.\nThen he needs to go over to your place.

Typical American attitude. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me! Who cares what you want?!\u201d Never mind he has to work. Never mind it\u2019s a holiday only you celebrate.

Why can\u2019t you?!", "YTA and dramatic.", "I don\u2019t know what he works or what type of person he is, but social interactions can be exhausting for people. If he is working all day socially or is just a bit more introverted, I get him not wanting to come, even if he \u201ejust\u201c has to eat and socialize.", "I would come over. I imagine there have been many times when he went out with buddies late and then crawled into work the next day. People make choices. He has made his. File it away and be mindful.

Or plan another Thanksgiving with just the two of you?", "NAH that you feel it's important for you but let's be real if he works in Office till 22.30 he might in the best of cases be there 23.00 that means 0.00 o'clock+getting home. people often want to use their own setups if they do wfh,so that would be a whole lot of stress so I also can't see him as the A in that situation", "YTA for this instant, however explain this is an important time, so, next year request he books the time off.\n\nEnjoy your thanks giving feast", "NTA.  He is also American, and you told him about this before.  The fact that he can\u2019t make an effort and get perhaps 1 hour less of sleep shows his unwillingness to sacrifice his comfort for you.  He has a right not to inconvenience himself.  But you have a right to be hurt.  Just realize the extent of his feelings and make sure not to go out of your way for him - otherwise resentment will eventually ruin your relationship.", "YTA", "NAH. As an American living in the UK, I completely understand your point of view. I get very, very homesick around Halloween to Christmas and it's really difficult to be away from family and friends. \n\nBut he does have a very small amount of time between work shifts so I also understand his perspective.\n\nI think what would be best is to explain to him how important this is to you and ask him to take next year off so that you can celebrate it together. If he's not able to do that, I think it would be best to content yourself with the fact that you have 10 people coming. I think that's pretty fantastic.", "I understand your sentiment, but you'd do good not taking such things too personal and accepting it for your own sake and your relationship - Talk over it if you didn't already, but let it go", "As an American living in Europe, NTA and I suspect many people saying YTA here would have a different view if they had to spend Christmas alone abroad", "As an American living in Europe, NTA and I suspect many people saying YTA here would have a different view if they had to spend Christmas alone abroad. \n\nYes it\u2019s convenient for him and he has every right to say no, but it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to feel upset that your partner isn\u2019t willing to spend at least an hour with you on what, for some people, is the most important holiday of the year", "I\u2019m shocked at the comments calling YTA. I think your entitled to be upset he isn\u2019t making the smallest bit of effort for you when you have explained how homesick your feeling. As a Brit thanksgiving means nothing over here but if my partner was so far away from the people he loved as you are and needed support from the people he does have around I would be the first one bending over backwards to be there I would pull a all nighter and go do a 14 hour shift and do it all again for him or for anyone I care about. It\u2019s not as plain and simple as should he go and should you be mad if he doesn\u2019t it\u2019s does he care for you as much as a partner should. Also depends on how long you have been together as to how hurt you should be. Just my opinion NTA. And I\u2019m sorry you are feeling down and missing your family I hope you have a lovely thanksgiving regardless.", "I don't get all the Y T A comments. I don't think you are in the wrong for expecting your boyfriend to spend time with you on a day that is obviously very important to you and on which you get homesick because you're so far away from your family. You neither expect him to take a day off nor to help out or stay for ages. I guess you shouldn't push it anymore, because it does not sound like he'll change his mind, but you should certainly tell how his stance makes you feel. NTA.", "Does he know how you feel about the holiday? Does he know you\u2019re homesick? If yes then I get it. I don\u2019t necessarily feel like YTA but maybe could have handled it a bit better. But if he knows what it means to you he could suck it up for an hour and come. Does he usually do this like this or is this out of charactwr", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
