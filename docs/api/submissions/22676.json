I hope you pay for her therapy when she gets older. This whole post was disgusting.", "YTA - they\u2019re KIDS\u2026both of them. Even though 13 year old are notoriously\u2026well\u202613. They\u2019re still kids. Their brains aren\u2019t developed and what you said to Maia probably really affected her. It was cruel. You\u2019re an adult and should know better. \nNo wonder you don\u2019t have a sisterly relationship - have you even bothered trying to get to know your step sister? Or do you just treat her like she\u2019s less than all the time?", "YTA. You might be a young adult but you\u2019re still an adult and you should know better than to speak to a child like that.  And kids who yell and whine until they get what they want are taught that because their parents teach them that it works. Don\u2019t blame a kid for reacting like their conditioning has taught them.  \n\nBlended families can be tricky. So can teenage girls (you were one once, does everything you did as a teenager seem rational to you now?). You told a probably insecure, hormonal, and already upset teenage girl (who likely looks up to you) that you love her less than the sister that you share a common blood with. You just created years of therapy for that kid. \n\nYou are a giant asshole.", "You are TA. A huge one. The damage you are *purposely* doing to that girl's self-esteem, sense of self-worthy, ability to trust others and her ability to know that her family will always be her safe place IS NOT FIXABLE. Let that sink in. The damage you have done cannot be undone. You are a horrible excuse for a 'sister' to both of them.", "YTA you\u2019re just mean for no reason. It wasn\u2019t necessary. She\u2019s 13 and you\u2019re 23. Grow up! If I was your mom I\u2019d be so disappointed in you. Some toddlers scream more than others and have trouble regulating emotions. You don\u2019t hold it against them. You on the other hand are 23 and I\u2019d hold this against you.", "YTA. Grow up. She\u2019s only a kid.", "YTA. You are way too old not to understand how damaging that is for a 13-year-old to hear. If you feel that way, that's one thing. To tell her is really awful.", "YTA.  First, you act as if it\u2019s OK to set up a competition between sisters. Second, you treat one horribly and the other can do no wrong. Third, you act as if you are blameless for her behavior because \u2018she\u2019s 13 not a toddler\u2019, well newsflash, she acts this way at 13 BECAUSE of the way you and your parents treated her when she was growing up.  Don\u2019t like the way she behaves? Look in the mirror for some reasons.", "YTA. Maia is a child, who you have apparently disliked her whole life, because she was a whiny toddler as most toddlers are. That\u2019s sad, and definitely not something that needed to be said out loud.

Guess how that often manifests itself:  insecure kiddos who don\u2019t know where they fit in in the new family and who need  a lot of attention and reassurance. They attempt to get it by whining and fit throwing. \n\nBut you fixed that insecurity problem right quick by telling her you don\u2019t love her as much as her sister.

You are a grown ass adult. Your stepsister is a 13 year old child. Just coming into her teens.

But not every feeling /thought needs to be vocalized. \n\nAt the age of 23, you can\u2019t still think being intentionally mean to your 13 year old sister is okay. And yes, she is your sister whether you want to see her as one or not. \n\nShe might\u2019ve been a difficult kid but that\u2019s not her fault. You\u2019ve been there since she was a toddler, all she knows is that you\u2019re her big sister and now she knows that you don\u2019t love her or even like her.

Grow up.", "YTA. Not for loving Bella more, it's fine if you love one sister more than the other, but you are the asshole for saying those things to Maia.", "YTA and your inability to accept that judgement proves that you are immature to boot. But let's break this down; you're a 23 year old in a feud with 13 year old. That should be your first hint that you're an asshole. You actively insulted this child, for what sounds like not the first time. Your comments show that you refuse to look at how your actions influence the entire being of the young child in your proximity. When other people point out your AH behavior, your first reaction is to attack a child. You're actively pitting two young sisters against each other. \n\nThere's a bit more, but each of these things are enough to point out that you are an asshole. Frankly, it doesn't matter if your stepsister is a brat. She's 13, what's your excuse? Seriously OP, do better.", "So you basically admitted that you didn't care to remember to pick up Maia because you don't love her but wouldn't do that to Bella because you do?? \n\nWhat a completely horrible ass person you are. If you knew you couldn't be assed to pick her up then you should have said no instead of putting it so low on your list that you forgot her. \n\nI wanna thank Maia though, I wanna thank her that she made you wanna be childless because no child deserves such a heartless person as a mother. \n\nYou're mad that a toddler....acted like a toddler?? And still hold that against her to this day?? Are you dumb?? Your PARENTS are the ones who should have stepped in when she was having her tantrums and dealt with it. Whatever attitude Maia has developed is a direct result of her/your parents. \n\nYou're a massive massive asshole. Please stick to the no child thing. Don't suffer the innocent.\n\nYTA", "YTA - not for not feeling a sisterly relationship with your step sister, that is what it is. But majorly for what you said. Regardless of what you think of her/dislike her. You are the adult. You don\u2019t stoop down to a 13 year old\u2019s level in an argument. \n\nShould she have said that? Absolutely not. But you could have something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I do something to upset you? I really don\u2019t appreciate you calling me that name and don\u2019t think I did anything to deserve that.\u201d Or if you don\u2019t want to engage her you could have said something similar to your parents like \u201cwow I really don\u2019t think I did anything for her to call me that name, I hope you will address this with her.\u201d\n\nExplain it to her like she is a child, because she is. You gain nothing from being mean to her. We all know you can zing her, that doesn\u2019t mean you should.", "YTA Definitely an absolute arsehole. You didn\u2019t need to say that to her. She\u2019s a child. You\u2019re supposed to be an adult.", "YTA, so so much so. She is a child and she will remember this betrayal for her whole life. You're a full grown adult, you need to act like it. Based on your replies, it honestly sounds like YOU'RE 13, you act like a spoiled teenager the same way she does. \"Spoiler alert\" wtf is wrong with you? \"Everyone at school\" her school that you don't attend bc you are an adult? Grow up", "YTA. Put yourself in your stepsister's shoes. Imagine a grandmother or beloved aunt (or whoever) saying that they don't love you as much as your younger sister. Maybe you had some challenging behaviors as a child or a teenager due to your parents' divorce or blending families. How would you feel if that was held against you all these years later and someone said, thanks for reminding me why I don't love you.

You're a grown ass adult. I get being closer with one sibling that happens but for me, being close with my oldest sibling doesn't mean I love my younger sister less, it's a different relationship, but the love is there.

You also need to learn about self-regulation.", "YTA your not an asshole for feeling how you feel like that is what it is. You are an asshole for how you reacted to a child hearing that someone doesnt like them. Like even making a joke like that when she could be around is just being cruel and unneccesary.

OP's parents should have noticed it and done more to fix those issues, but it can be hard to see if OP was careful to hide it, and not everyone has access to family therapy to help when melding two families together, so it's understandable things can be missed, but OP is now an adult and should be expected to behave as such. She's free to keep nursing that resentment if she feels she must, but she's not free to unload it all on a child. And seriously, OP, get some therapy, you clearly could use it, and it would be better to have a good relationship with your stepsister (or at least a neutral one) than this bs going forward. You aren't doing yourself any favours, and you are definitely YTA.\n\n And you aren't doing your \"golden child\" half-sister any favours either.

While she is an adult now she was a child when she got a step sister. She was also older than both little sisters and could have been cast to the side while the parents focused on the new shiny kids.
