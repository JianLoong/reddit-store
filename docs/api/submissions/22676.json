I hope you pay for her therapy when she gets older. This whole post was disgusting.", "YTA - they\u2019re KIDS\u2026both of them. Even though 13 year old are notoriously\u2026well\u202613. They\u2019re still kids. Their brains aren\u2019t developed and what you said to Maia probably really affected her. It was cruel. You\u2019re an adult and should know better. \nNo wonder you don\u2019t have a sisterly relationship - have you even bothered trying to get to know your step sister? Or do you just treat her like she\u2019s less than all the time?", "YTA. You might be a young adult but you\u2019re still an adult and you should know better than to speak to a child like that.  And kids who yell and whine until they get what they want are taught that because their parents teach them that it works. Don\u2019t blame a kid for reacting like their conditioning has taught them.  \n\nBlended families can be tricky. So can teenage girls (you were one once, does everything you did as a teenager seem rational to you now?). You told a probably insecure, hormonal, and already upset teenage girl (who likely looks up to you) that you love her less than the sister that you share a common blood with. You just created years of therapy for that kid. \n\nYou are a giant asshole.", "You are TA. A huge one. The damage you are *purposely* doing to that girl's self-esteem, sense of self-worthy, ability to trust others and her ability to know that her family will always be her safe place IS NOT FIXABLE. Let that sink in. The damage you have done cannot be undone. You are a horrible excuse for a 'sister' to both of them.", "YTA you\u2019re just mean for no reason. It wasn\u2019t necessary. She\u2019s 13 and you\u2019re 23. Grow up! If I was your mom I\u2019d be so disappointed in you. Some toddlers scream more than others and have trouble regulating emotions. You don\u2019t hold it against them. You on the other hand are 23 and I\u2019d hold this against you.", "YTA. Grow up. She\u2019s only a kid.", "YTA. You are way too old not to understand how damaging that is for a 13-year-old to hear. If you feel that way, that's one thing. To tell her is really awful.", "YTA.  First, you act as if it\u2019s OK to set up a competition between sisters. Second, you treat one horribly and the other can do no wrong. Third, you act as if you are blameless for her behavior because \u2018she\u2019s 13 not a toddler\u2019, well newsflash, she acts this way at 13 BECAUSE of the way you and your parents treated her when she was growing up.  Don\u2019t like the way she behaves? Look in the mirror for some reasons.", "YTA. Maia is a child, who you have apparently disliked her whole life, because she was a whiny toddler as most toddlers are. That\u2019s sad, and definitely not something that needed to be said out loud.

Guess how that often manifests itself:  insecure kiddos who don\u2019t know where they fit in in the new family and who need  a lot of attention and reassurance. They attempt to get it by whining and fit throwing. \n\nBut you fixed that insecurity problem right quick by telling her you don\u2019t love her as much as her sister.

You are a grown ass adult. Your stepsister is a 13 year old child. Just coming into her teens. In case you're so old that you can't remember what that's like, her emotions and hormones are all out of whack and who she was isn't who she's growing to be.

But not every feeling /thought needs to be vocalized. \n\nAt the age of 23, you can\u2019t still think being intentionally mean to your 13 year old sister is okay. And yes, she is your sister whether you want to see her as one or not. \n\nShe might\u2019ve been a difficult kid but that\u2019s not her fault. You\u2019ve been there since she was a toddler, all she knows is that you\u2019re her big sister and now she knows that you don\u2019t love her or even like her.

Grow up.", "YTA. Not for loving Bella more, it's fine if you love one sister more than the other, but you are the asshole for saying those things to Maia.", "YTA and your inability to accept that judgement proves that you are immature to boot. But let's break this down; you're a 23 year old in a feud with 13 year old. That should be your first hint that you're an asshole. You actively insulted this child, for what sounds like not the first time. Your comments show that you refuse to look at how your actions influence the entire being of the young child in your proximity. When other people point out your AH behavior, your first reaction is to attack a child. You're actively pitting two young sisters against each other. \n\nThere's a bit more, but each of these things are enough to point out that you are an asshole. Frankly, it doesn't matter if your stepsister is a brat. She's 13, what's your excuse? Seriously OP, do better.", "So you basically admitted that you didn't care to remember to pick up Maia because you don't love her but wouldn't do that to Bella because you do?? \n\nWhat a completely horrible ass person you are. If you knew you couldn't be assed to pick her up then you should have said no instead of putting it so low on your list that you forgot her. \n\nI wanna thank Maia though, I wanna thank her that she made you wanna be childless because no child deserves such a heartless person as a mother. \n\nYou're mad that a toddler....acted like a toddler?? And still hold that against her to this day?? Are you dumb?? Your PARENTS are the ones who should have stepped in when she was having her tantrums and dealt with it. Whatever attitude Maia has developed is a direct result of her/your parents. \n\nYou're a massive massive asshole. Please stick to the no child thing. Don't suffer the innocent.\n\nYTA", "YTA - not for not feeling a sisterly relationship with your step sister, that is what it is. But majorly for what you said. Regardless of what you think of her/dislike her. You are the adult. You don\u2019t stoop down to a 13 year old\u2019s level in an argument. \n\nShould she have said that? Absolutely not. But you could have something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I do something to upset you? I really don\u2019t appreciate you calling me that name and don\u2019t think I did anything to deserve that.\u201d Or if you don\u2019t want to engage her you could have said something similar to your parents like \u201cwow I really don\u2019t think I did anything for her to call me that name, I hope you will address this with her.\u201d\n\nExplain it to her like she is a child, because she is. You gain nothing from being mean to her. We all know you can zing her, that doesn\u2019t mean you should.", "YTA Definitely an absolute arsehole. You didn\u2019t need to say that to her. She\u2019s a child. You\u2019re supposed to be an adult.", "YTA, so so much so. She is a child and she will remember this betrayal for her whole life. You're a full grown adult, you need to act like it. Based on your replies, it honestly sounds like YOU'RE 13, you act like a spoiled teenager the same way she does. \"Spoiler alert\" wtf is wrong with you? \"Everyone at school\" her school that you don't attend bc you are an adult? Grow up", "YTA. Put yourself in your stepsister's shoes. Imagine a grandmother or beloved aunt (or whoever) saying that they don't love you as much as your younger sister. Maybe you had some challenging behaviors as a child or a teenager due to your parents' divorce or blending families. How would you feel if that was held against you all these years later and someone said, thanks for reminding me why I don't love you.

You're a grown ass adult. I get being closer with one sibling that happens but for me, being close with my oldest sibling doesn't mean I love my younger sister less, it's a different relationship, but the love is there.

You also need to learn about self-regulation.", "YTA your not an asshole for feeling how you feel like that is what it is. You are an asshole for how you reacted to a child hearing that someone doesnt like them. Like even making a joke like that when she could be around is just being cruel and unneccesary.

OP's parents should have noticed it and done more to fix those issues, but it can be hard to see if OP was careful to hide it, and not everyone has access to family therapy to help when melding two families together, so it's understandable things can be missed, but OP is now an adult and should be expected to behave as such. She's free to keep nursing that resentment if she feels she must, but she's not free to unload it all on a child. And seriously, OP, get some therapy, you clearly could use it, and it would be better to have a good relationship with your stepsister (or at least a neutral one) than this bs going forward. You aren't doing yourself any favours, and you are definitely YTA.\n\n And you aren't doing your \"golden child\" half-sister any favours either. You are teaching her some really toxic things with regards to her place in the family relationship in relation to her sister. And that's really gross. It is going to end up nurturing another AH like you in the family.", "This", "Well, if 13 is old enough that it's okay to be told by your adult sister that she hates you and loves your little sister more, then 23 is way too old to be bullying a fucking child. Holy shit, have a look at your priorities.", "23 years old is old enough to not be an unreasonable asshole to a child", "Holy shit! This seriously needs to be THE top comment.", "This is the perfect response.\nAnd OP, YTA.", "I'd say she was perfectly entitled to call her a bitch. Sounds on the mark.", "Eh, op is an asshole for this but she\u2019s not gunna stop loving her sister just because she doesn\u2019t love some other kid she had thrown into her life", "Wtf? Lol thanks I fixed it \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "[removed]", "A throwaway \"yo parents\" joke at the end is a personal attack for you? Lol, welcome to the internet. Sounds like i actually struck a nerve there\n\nAnd exactly, read the shit: that a grown ass adult telling a 13y kid that he never loved her as much as her sister. Thats not the usual back and forth banter between siblings. One is an actual child, the other is an adult acting like a child. And a child of her age is gonna remember that, especially since OP seemingly reminds her of it every chance he gets - read his replies in the comments.", "What you're saying is correct, but you do know the comment you're replying to was being sarcastic, right?", "whoosh", "Probably. Conniving little b\\*tch!", "Babies are the worst. Fucking needy things they are. Lmao", "You can always tell too - because their post karma will be 400 and their comment karma will be -800 \ud83d\ude02", "You\u2019re 23 bullying a middle schooler\u2026.", "Can't believe that you're talking about someone 10 years younger than you", "There is *nothing,* and I mean absolutely *nothing* that a CHILD can do that would justify a grown-ass adult's decision to bully them.\n\nShe is a kid. And apparently a kid that was raised in a blended family where a much older step-sibling has resented her since she was a literal baby and made it very clear that she is an unwanted second-class citizen in her own home. For her WHOLE LIFE she's had to deal with this shit, and you wonder why her behavior isn't perfect?\n\nYou are not a child anymore. Start using that mostly-developed frontal lobe of yours and look at the situation objectively, instead of through the eyes of the immature teenager who developed this grudge you're still holding. She is not just your \"annoying step-sister,\"  or whatever, she is a whole person of her own and you're treating her like shit. Let go of the childish egocentrism, grow some some fucking empathy, and learn to treat her like the child she is, not like your middle school arch-nemisis.", "Again,  you're literally justifying bullying a child as an adult.", "How would you even know what \"the kids in school\" think about her? You are 23, you aren't in the classroom.\n\nYou're making Bella sound like just as much of a bully, if she's reporting to you that Maia is having trouble at school and you two are giggling about it.", "Maybe she acts out because her step family has made it clear for her entire life how much they despise her while coddling and pouring love onto her younger sister.  You are 100% part of the problem here and very much a bully yourself.", "Kids learn from many different aspects of their life including but not limited to family, school, friends, and media. \nFamily can definitely influence how a child acts. It may not be a total reflection of one y\u2019all act but how you treat her. Kids who act out tend to be doing as a way of voicing something they can\u2019t say verbally bc they don\u2019t know how to verbalize it or how to even comprehend what\u2019s going on with them. If kids feel they are loved less, they will also act out too: \u201cmy family doesn\u2019t love me as much so I\u2019ll just do whatever because they don\u2019t care anyways\u201d or \u201cMy family doesn\u2019t seem to care but I want them to so to get their attention, I will act out until it\u2019s noticed.\u201d Of course, this isn\u2019t the case for some children, but difficulties in life and feelings can be hard for children, and even adults, to process in a healthy and productive manner which is way kids tend to act out as a result. You are not her guardian, but with your parents, possibly figure out why this stuff is happening. \n\nOh also, kids who are ostracized will act out even more.", "Google \u201cscapegoat\u201d. You are engaging in a form of abuse. If you continue, you are doing it knowingly and willingly. What words would you use to describe a person who knowingly and willingly abused a child?", "she\u2019s 13 dude calm tf down", "You. Are. An. Adult. \n\n(I don\u2019t actually think you are, but if you claim to be, you are doing a really shitty job of being one.)", "youre far from being an adult, even at your age, and it shows by how you BULLY A CHILD, because you know another adult wouldnt stand for your bs, so you have to feel above a 13 year old, its sad", "The problem is never the 13 year old child being bullied by a grown ass woman. You\u2019re 10 years her senior. Act like it. You should be setting an example for heron how to be a good person, a good sister. \n\nAsk yourself. If she treated the youngest the way you treat her, would it be acceptable?", "You are an adult. That is the difference.", "So then you talk to other ADULTS about it. If your family are enabling her, talk to THEM about it. If she needs more disciple, or therapy, or both, you **TALK TO AN ADULT.**\n\n**There\u2019s no scenario there you say this kind of shit to a kid where you\u2019re not inherently the asshole. Be an adult, FFS.**", "She\u2019s looking for attention because her big sister is so cruel.", "You\u2019re picking a fight and putting down a teenager. How are you not embarrassed?", "So your argument is that a bunch of 10-13yr olds agree with you? You do realize how ridiculous that is, right? Your emotional maturity is on par with 10-13yr olds.", "At least she has the excuse of being 13....what is your excuse for being awful?", "Bro you're 23, quit acting like a middle schooler yourself", "You asked if you're YTA.  YTA.  She's a kid.  Grow up and pretend to act like an adult.", "I'm going to wager a guess and say that you have never accepted her even as a toddler, and have always treated her poorly.  She grew up with resentment towards you and learned to act out to get attention from you, even if it was negative.  She likely struggled all her life with her emotions growing up in a house with someone who is hateful towards her.  She turned all that hate you spewed towards her in on herself, then out to others.  Maybe if you led by example and showed her how to love herself and invested time into her while growing up, this situation would have turned out differently.  And by the sounds of it, you don't really care if YTA or not because you already decided you weren't.  You came here for validation that you don't deserve so congrats, YTA.  I hope that girl gets therapy and is loved wholeheartedly by someone, since it clearly isn't you.", "You\u2019re still the adult. You don\u2019t get to participate in children\u2019s fights. Grow up.", "Lol you must\u2019ve peaked in middle school. YTA", "Okay, even if she is a spoiled brat,  you play into it like you\u2019re also 13 when you are in fact a grown woman? And you don\u2019t even simply call her out in an immature way, you go for the jugular and tell her she\u2019s not as worthy of love? You seriously don\u2019t see how much of an immature, petty and cruel AH you sound like?", "My friend, you are an adult and you are being rude to your 13 year old stepsister. That makes my stomach feel SICK.", "\u201cIf me and a bunch of !!13!! year olds agree that she\u2019s the problem, then she\u2019s the problem\u201d you\u2019re weird as fuck.", "Nope. I guess I gave OP TOO much credit that they\u2019d know their own post.", "Not for a 13 year old. The parents do nothing in the post and are bad parents. OP is just as bad. The adults around Maia are failing her by not giving her what she needs to grow into an adult with healthy emotional, social, and intellectual development.", "Keep telling yourself that. \n\nWhen someone uses \"love\" in the way that op does, it's never genuine. Op is 23, her step sister is 13. Op is holding a grudge against her, not for anything she did but for her parents' lack of parenting.\n\nShe dislikes someone for how they acted as a toddler, funny she doesn't Haye her sister the same", "People don't typically get sarcasm on the internet without proper indication.", "I wonder how long it takes them to figure it out", "Ugh, right it's like get a job already! No one cares that you can't hold your own head up \ud83d\ude44", "But it\u2019s a rude middle schooler!", "Plenty of people love their actual siblings and not their step siblings \n\nBeing a dick about it isn\u2019t the play tho", "Ultimate choosing beggars!", "So. . . a middle schooler. . ."]}
