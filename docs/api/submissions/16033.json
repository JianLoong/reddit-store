I haven\u2019t had many interactions with her as my fianc\u00e9 is In the army and rarely sees his son. We only saw each other when she would go to my fianc\u00e9s family\u2019s partys and I went. Well at the party I went inside the house to grab something and his ex wife followed me. She asked me what I was doing there and to leave. Because she found it disrespectful I was there with my fianc\u00e9 while her son was there. I kinda just looked at her waiting for her to say she was joking. But she said a bunch of other rude things to me saying I was a hoe and that she didn\u2019t think I was fit to be in her sons life and she wanted me to leave. I told her she had always pushed me and my fianc\u00e9 away when we tried to sit down and talk with her.

It seems that they've tried to sit down and talk to her, but the ex might be using the child as  pawn to get back at her ex husband.

But this is all guesses.", "OP has not mentioned deployment at all. all of these people & their respective families seem to live within close proximity to each other. OP has known the ex for years, they all attend family events etc. etc.  being in the army does not prevent anyone for having visitation rights with their child. he is either just choosing NOT to see the kid or never bothered to do anything to get visitation.\n\nso, /u/Xxari18 why is it that your fianc\u00e9 does not see his son?", "I'm sorry, but you might have a comprehension problem.
