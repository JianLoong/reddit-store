My fianc\u00e9s ex wife was there at the party and as well as their 4 year old son. Me and my fianc\u00e9 arrived a while later after the party started. I haven\u2019t had many interactions with her as my fianc\u00e9 is In the army and rarely sees his son. We only saw each other when she would go to my fianc\u00e9s family\u2019s partys and I went. Well at the party I went inside the house to grab something and his ex wife followed me. She asked me what I was doing there and to leave. Because she found it disrespectful I was there with my fianc\u00e9 while her son was there. I kinda just looked at her waiting for her to say she was joking. But she said a bunch of other rude things to me saying I was a hoe and that she didn\u2019t think I was fit to be in her sons life and she wanted me to leave. I told her she had always pushed me and my fianc\u00e9 away when we tried to sit down and talk with her. Keep in mind I\u2019ve known her for a few years and I was around her kid when he was little because my fianc\u00e9s family and my family have known each other for years and always spent the holidays together. Well, I said I wasn\u2019t leaving because my parents were hosting the party and I wasn\u2019t aware she was going to be there and that she was acting like I was a stranger. I told my fianc\u00e9 and he defended me. But when I asked a few people around they said I should\u2019ve just left to avoid drama.
