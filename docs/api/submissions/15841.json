ILs decided they would do a George Foreman when they had kids so they have a Michael, Michelle, Michaela, Micah, Micky, etc. MIL also calls herself Michelle because they like the idea of having the same name essentially. My wife has always hated that her name is the female version of her dad's and her brothers and that she and her sister have just different variants of the same name. She told me when we met we would not be having Michaels or Michaela's. My name is definitely unique and it's also different when you consider their family name lol. My name is Cyrax. I was named after a video game character my dad loved. Not a name everyone will know or have heard of. My ILs hate my name. They told me to my face once that they could not understand why I didn't change my name to something normal when I got the chance to. But hey, I like my name.\n\nTheir dislike of my name is not something they try to hide and it bugs me sometimes. It was when my wife and I announced we were expecting a few weeks ago that I might have gotten a little petty. So MIL was saying she was hoping we would choose a normal name for her grandchild and brought up the family's love of Michael. I was like we weren't going to be choosing a name like the rest of the family and not to worry, they would find out when baby arrives. She told me it would be selfish for me to dump a weird name on a child when I know the struggles. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about. She said there is no way I wasn't bullied in school or that I didn't lose out on job opportunities because of my name. I rolled my eyes. She insisted there was no way and she would not believe me. I was like \"Okay Gorge Foreman, I get you\" but I was being sarcastic and I was rolling my eyes at her. MIL freaked out at me and said at least he passed on a normal name, just like they did, with fine, dignified names and they weren't stupid like my parents were when they named me. My wife told her mom to shut up and we left.\n\nThe rest of my ILs said I was rude and should apologize. They said it's not like they're all Michael so why with the George Foreman comparison.
