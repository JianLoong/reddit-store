If you truly misinterpreted him, he had the opportunity to clarify immediately.  This is classic for someone being called out on an inappropriate comment.", "NTA this dude needs to see a therapist if he is loosing sleep over this one situation.", "NTA - lol lol, man makes sexist comment then goes all picachu surprised face when someone points it out. \n\nBut my hot tip is always always to respond to those kinds of comments with innocent curiosity. \u201cWhat an interesting thing to say - can you explain what you mean please?\u201d Backs the commenter into a corner without being confrontational.", "NTA\nHe expressed his opinion, and you stated a fact. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s blowing it up, only more people will know what his opinion is. And it seems that he was embarrassed by you, which means that he knew his opinion was wrong.", "NTA \n\nYour BIL is ridiculous and reacts exactly as you would expect from a guy who is confronted with his misogyny", "You acted correctly to dispel a sexist trope (on par with \u201cmen don\u2019t know how to use vacuum cleaner\u201d). Your BiL might not have been intentionally sexist - but he was perpetuating a sexist stereotype. He should have appreciated you pointing that out - rather than sulk (which is a yet another sexist - and abusive - trope: \u201cgive her the silent treatment until she apologizes\u201d).\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nkeep up the good work...calling out misogyny is vital for the species to improve. \n\nHe needs to own his embarrassment...he said the words, doubled down and now has to deal with the cinsequence. \n\nIf he doesn't want to be seen as a sexist, he needs to stop acting like one.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t even call him sexist, but he is so\u2026 If he doesn\u2019t want people to *know* he\u2019s sexist, he should keep those thoughts to himself. \n\nI also love how it\u2019s your fault that he feels badly. He made a sexist comment, he should feel badly, he\u2019s the one that messed up here. There are lots of books out there that can help him educate himself if he would like to be a better person rather than blaming others for his failings.", "NTA.   Sleepless nights ??  Tell him to get over it.", "NTA.\n\nIt's also BS. My dad always did his own ironing AND steaming.  My dad, a man, is better at ironing than me, a woman.", "NTA\n\nHe can dish it out, but can't take it, huh?\n\nI mean he said something sexist, but you joked back and got him good.  He shouldn't be upset at all.  You absolutely cannot crack jokes at someone else's expense and then not be able to take one at your expense.  That's not actually humor, that's usually just cruelty disguised as humor.  That means that your intent was cruel which is why you took the response the same way.\n\nIf he's losing sleep over this and avoiding you, try to have a chat.  Tell him you were joking back and  know he's not actually like that.", "NTA. If he doesn't want to be seen as sexist, he shouldn't make sexist comments.", "NTA now you know not to step on his fragile fee-fees", "NTA. You didn't say anything particularly embarrassing to him. He could have laughed and said something about how it's a good thing there are new inventions everyone can embrace or something. He was being overly sensitive to stew about this afterwards. Seems like it's more because someone turned the tables on him and got the laugh.", "NTA he's being sensitive but those that make jokes at others expense tend not to like it when they are put in that position", "NTA - you're right he is a clown.", "NTA. He made a comment that probably wasn\u2019t supposed to be sexist. You took it that way and comment (albeit in a funny way) and he felt bad. Doesn\u2019t sound like anyone was actually wrong. More miscommunication. Sometimes I will gender things even though there is no need...everyone does it occasionally. Even this girl could do xyz.", "NTA. Your comment was on target in a funny and light hearted way. He sounds incredibly thin skinned.", "I can't understand why he's having such a reaction to a very very mild, and simply accurate comment. Sleepless nights?\n\nI think he's having a crisis because he realized in that moment, he actually IS sexist. Because it doesn't sound like you called him out or humiliated him. \n\nI'm glad I proofread, because I almost said he actually IS sexiest", "NTA\n\nAs someone with a penis, I find an iron pretty simple to use, and I often find myself in charge of ironing duties, because my gf has a habit of leaving burn marks on all of our fancy clothing. \n\nOn the flip side, she literally rebuilt our lawnmower and does all the oil changes for our cars, because I don\u2019t know anything about engines and half of her family members are mechanics. \n\nThis men\u2019s work/women\u2019s work shit needs to die already. Modern tools have rendered almost all chores equally accomplishable by anyone with the (non-gendered) skills and experience to use them.", "NTA. Well, if he doesn\u2019t want to be seen as sexist, then he needs to learn from this event, not repeat it, and move forward. Not sit and brood and punish you for calling him out. \n\nWhy should you react for what he thinks?  Are you a mind reader? \n\nIf he wants to clear his conscience, then there is a simple thing he can do - apologize.", "NTA\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t want people to think he\u2019s sexist then he shouldn\u2019t say sexist things. I\u2019m not buying that he didn\u2019t know a common sexist trope is sexist. But on the off chance he made a legitimate error, he\u2019s acting like a baby about it. \n\nMy husband is 69 years old and occasionally (very rarely) says or does something he doesn\u2019t realize is a little offensive. You know what he does when he\u2019s called out on it? Apologizes. And asks questions if he doesn\u2019t understand (some things are subtle). And then he changes his behavior. Absolutely nobody in his life thinks ill of him for his occasional human error. We are all human and we all mess up sometimes. It\u2019s vastly more important to recognize the error, apologize, and change the behavior than it is to never mess up to begin with.\n\nYour BIL is being a toddler about it. I\u2019m more likely to deem him problematic based on his reaction to being called out than the original comment.", "NTA. Did you tell your sister your psychic powers are down for maintenance? Because that's the only way you could reasonably know that what your BiL said is not what he thinks. Jokes always have an element of truth in them.", "NTA. Seems like he wanted to stay a closeted misogynist. Tell stupid \"jokes\" get a great response. Don't let them make you feel guilty for calling him out on it.", "When a misogynist decides to give the silent treatment, it's truly a gift that others around them should appreciate.", "I think you\u2019re probably onto something. He had to confront a sexist stereotype he held and it\u2019s understandably uncomfortable, but instead of going \u201chuh, why did I think that\u201d and moving on, he decided to make it OP\u2019s fault.\nI worked at a hardware store throughout my 20s and have witnessed many customers silently confront their feelings about a girl offering to help them at a lumber desk."]}
