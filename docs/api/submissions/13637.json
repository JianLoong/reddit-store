It's not your fault and you've done nothing wrong by accepting gifts. Plus the tradeoff (more money vs more involved childcare) makes sense.", "NTA for accepting the money, but it is a little shitty from her side to give better gifts to one child over the other. Not your responsibility, and at the age of 1 it doesn't matter, but starting already from 2-3 they will definitely start noticing and it is really unfair to the other kid.", "ESH except your Nan. Why is your Nan who is almost 90 babysitting a baby DAILY?! That is too much! And why are you accepting more money from your Nan, I get she wants to help and that\u2019s sweet but maybe she could put it into a savings account for your baby instead?", "ESH a nearly 90 year old no matter how spry should not be tasked with childcare.  What are you doing accepting money from a nearly 90 year old no matter how well off? Both you and your cousin need to reevaluate your entitlement.\n\nEdit: misspelling", "NTA, it\u2019s her money to do with as she\u2019s sees fit; not your issue", "It\u2019s not her place to fight with you. Your Gran is spending her money as she wishes. It\u2019s not up to anyone to tell her what she does with it.", "NTA> Auntie doesn't have a say what Nan does with her money. And she has no say about you accepting it. She needs to stay in her own lane.", "NTA. No one aside from your nan gets to decide how she spends her money. You cousin is being entitled - she is getting a massive benefit of free childcare.", "NTA. Calculate the cost of childcare your cousin is saving and I bet she's way ahead.", "Aw what a sweet great granny, she keeps the balance , since she takes care of one great grand kid, she sends money to the other and helps financially. Your aunt is such an AH and you are NTA.", "NTA Nan can use and spend her money however she wishes. It\u2019s her money it has nothing to do with anyone else. Also your cousin must be saving a fortune in childcare costs so perhaps your Nan should factor that in before she comes at you", "NTA.  \n\nMy mom does this to my child.  My mom lives further away and doesn't see and care for him on daily basis like some of her grandkids.  As a result, whenever she comes visit, she gives him money.  I have told her there is no need but I think it helps her feel good that she's still part of his life and contributing to his growth like the other grandkids.  I have learned to just accept and put it in his savings.  It is her money and she will spend it how she wants.", "NTA. It's not money that is the root of all evil, it's the love of money that's corruptible.  Your Nan can do what she wants and how she wants with her money and gifts.  She is more hands on with one child than the other and saving your cousin a ton of money in childcare.  It's interesting the aunt brought this up to you and not your Nan.", "It's your Nans money not your aunt. You say your aunt calculated all up? Did she also calculate all the nappies, food and time your Nan is putting in while watching her daughters child and not yours? If not perhaps you need to politely remind her to do that. Accept the money. Your aunt will just have to get over it.", "NTA. All I have to say is it\u2019s nans money and she can do what she wants with it. That\u2019s the only thing needing to be said. He money = her choice.", "NTA, for some reason people in this line of thinking always think they're hard done by in life despite all the help they get.\n\nIt's the same with my family, my sister would complain if my parents (very rarely) sent me some money. Their line of reasoning is they're always having to support and bail out her dumb ass for all sorts of life stuff (car stuff, bills, boyfriends trouble), so in their mind it's \"Fair\" to equally support me as they can.\n\nI live on my own and support myself and always refuse it, but it's like jeez get some self-reflection.", "Childcare is super expensive.. the cousin is most likely getting the better deal", "The other kid may start noticing, but as they get older they'll also be able to recognize that their great-grandmother spent more quality time with them. If Nan wasn't doing childcare etc for the other kid I would 100% agree with what you're saying here.", "She still does give my niece expensive gifts, but when I say she spent more on my kid it\u2019s because she bought him a birthday gift and paid what I needed to paint his room and put down play mats on his bedroom floor so not really noticeable\n\nAlso we live in different countries so they\u2019re unlikely to be walking around pointing out \u201cthat\u2019s what Nan got me!\u201d \u201cWell here is what Nan got me!\u201d", "I don\u2019t follow how either of us cousins are being entitled", "You do realise that grandmothers often give money to their grandchildren right?\n\nShe's doing it out of the goodness of her heart. Not because she's been asked to..", "It\u2019s my cousin\u2019s mum who has the problem\n\nCousin has actually sided with me and thinks her mum is barking up the wrong tree", "Once upon a time people would say, 'mind your own business,' several times per week. Since the invention of social media everyone thinks they have a right to butt into the personal affairs of others and act all self righteous. Instead of saying mind your own business, you are spending too much time trying to justify yourself to someone who is not a member of your household.", "NTA it's your grandmothers money she can do what she likes with it", "Nan can start charging for day care and give you the same amount of money. Your cousin will end up owning her", "NTA. My abuelita used to give my siblings and I extra money for treats. Why? Because we only saw her once or twice a year and the others all lived in her city. She had extra loving to catch up on during those vacations and part of how she showed it was cold hard cash which could be exchanged for ice cream. Cold hard ice cream... now I'm gonna go get ice cream", ">takes her to playgroup, feeds her, changes her, watches and plays with her so cousin can go out or just rest or unwind etc.\n\nI'm wondering how many of the supplies (gas, food, nappies, toys etc) Nan supplies for the cousin's kid as well."]}
