This has been going on for 13 years. We will travel to their house for dinner, or the beach for a lunch. This couple ALWAYS wants to cook. No matter what. (The events happen at their house, by and large, so I get it). The thing is THEY ALWAYS PUT A LOT OF ONIONS IN EVERY THING.  \n\nSo we will go over. Have some snacks, sit down for dinner, and start passing bowls. Invariably, there are onions everywhere. So I ended up having bread. When ever a host notices, they ask if everything is ok. I once again have to explain that I do NOT eat onions. \n\nAt this time, the laughter ensues. \u201cOh, man, we forgot\u201d. \u201cAwww, can\u2019t you eat around em\u201d \u201cthere\u2019s only one onion\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s chopped real fine\u201d.  None of these are suitable, because I don\u2019t eat fucking onions. It\u2019s been 13 years the one the only ask I\u2019ve ever made is don\u2019t put fucking on my fucking food. It\u2019s not a huge ask, but the fact that they can\u2019t remember makes me feel like crap. \n\nSo, it\u2019s now come to this: have been invited to dinner tonight. I am choosing not to go. If anyone asks my wife plans to say \u201cHe never eats onions. In 13 years, you\u2019ve never once never give this fact a single consideration in anyway.
