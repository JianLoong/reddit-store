Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, I visited my parents house and my sibling was staying with them again, my brother recently started dating the same ex and she was there. While visiting I went into my siblings room to get a box of things my grandma left to me and I noticed my ring sitting on the dresser (I knew it was mine because it had my husband and my name engraved inside of it) so I put it in my pocket figuring my parents found it and put it there. 2 days ago I visited again and wore the ring and my brothers girlfriend FREAKED OUT, accusing me of stealing her ring. We went back and forth before my dad stepped in, I showed my dad a picture and showed that the ring had my not common name engraved in it. I looked back at her social media and noticed she was wearing the ring around the time it went missing, so it's my belief that she stole the ring originally and because it's been so long she must have slipped up and forgotten that it was mine.

NTA for sure. But I suggest asking him to clarify why she would threaten to leave him over it.", "NTA \n\nThe ring was still yours and it was never hers.\n\nBut obviously she believed it was hers. That means, it was him, not her, who took it away from you. Then he gave it to her.", "NTA. This is your ring, you took your thing back to yourself. This is right.", "NTA. It\u2019s literally got your name on it. Your brother\u2019s girlfriend sounds awful and manipulative.", "NTA obviously. For the love YOUR NAME is engraved on it. What more proof do people need that she is a thief and a liar? Your brother is better off without her- better alone than with the wrong (and untrustworthy, entitled and criminal) person.", "NTA, this woman leaving your brother would not be your fault. All you did was wear your own ring.", "Info: do you have any idea why exactly she's threatening to leave your sibling over something that, even if she's convinced it was a wrong thing to do, YOU did, not him? Is this just emotional blackmail, to get him to beg you until you give it back to her, or does she have any logic at all behind it? \n\nIn case you hadn't figured out by now, very much NTA. If she leaves your sibling, so be it. There are much worse things than being alone, and being with a manipulative, thieving jerk who creates rifts between you and your family is high on the list.", "NTA, it's yours and the thing was stolen from you. However, your sibling's girlfriend threatening to leave him if she doesn't get it back, that's a pro asshole move. And it was already an asshole move to take a ring that was not hers at first.", "Is it possible to put brother stole it?\n\nWhere did she say she got it.?", "Is there any possible world where your sibling doesn't know it is for sure yours?\n\nYou're NTA, this sucks for your brother.", "NTA.\n\nIt's yours.

Encourage your brother to leave her. If this is what she's like when she's on her better behavior now just wait and see how fucked up she'll be if she's ever bitter and trying to break up with him.", "NTA.

Besides, it was in your parents\u2019 house so naturally you\u2019re going to think oh someone  in my family must\u2019ve found it and take it back.

Let him know that she\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t call the cops. \n\nLol maybe she should call the cops and confess to stealing it from you while trying to accuse you of stealing it. \n\nOr maybe your brother stole it and gave it to her.", "NTA\n\nIt's your ring, you din't steal it. back you took back your property.

Jeez!", "NTA.", "NTA, but I would die on this hill and tell him that either she drops it or you take the social media posts and your evidence to the police.", "She definitely knew it was mine because she was around when I got it. It would be one thing if I forgot it at someone else's house but it was at my parents house where I lived and was my safe space. But honestly I was shocked that she could steal it and then forget that she did, I feel like a good thief would remember even if it was so many years before.", "I did ask both of them where she got it and why would she throw such a fit if it had my name on it. She claims her child gave it to her but her kid was never at my parents house so I don't think it's possible that her kid stole it either. You would think since I had it on she would have kept her mouth shut and played dumb.", "Or she just acted like thief posing as an innocent victim, which I\u2019m more inclined to believe.", "That doesn't explain her insisting on having it after seeing it's engraved with OP's name. If her attitude didn't change after learning that, that means it's not new information to her.", "I'll go further - this woman leaving her brother would be a good thing. No one needs someone who steals from family.", "I think this is just how she behaves. She has a history from the first time they dated where she would gas light him into thinking he was wrong constantly. My sibling was in a bad accident before this happened and he had a brain injury that for a while messed up his memory. For example we had issues where some of his medications went missing even though both my mom and myself kept track of his meds but she would convince him he took more then he thought he did. I also considered that she is going to this extreme because there are pictures of them together and she is wearing the ring so he would have noticed I was wearing the same ring. I'm giving my sibling the benefit of the doubt that he truly didn't realize it was my ring because his accident really did mess up his memory. My parents and I both told my brother if she leaves that is on her because she messed up not him and he doesn't need to be with a thief, my parents also don't want her at their house anymore because of it. My brother is just struggling with mental health and his self esteem, my brother and I also don't currently have the best relationship right now for other reasons.", "I do not think my sibling stole just because at the time he just got home from the hospital after a bad accident and could not get around on his own (he was basically bed bound and the accident is the cause of the low self esteem). The accident is the reason the girlfriend was around so much at the time.", "If the brother was the one who stole it, the gf would be mortified on finding out it's OP's, not still demanding to have it.", "I think it is absolutely possible that he did not know because for one it has been so long and for two he was in a bad accident not to long before it was missing and had a traumatic brain injury from it he does have some memory issues from it. I also think its possible she said something because he did see her wearing it before I found it.", "> that make it difficult for him to find someone to be with.\n\nAdded,  this line is here the classic abusive relationship \"you have to stay with me because no one else will have you\" line.", "I feel bad because my sibling has very low self-esteem so he doesn't feel like he can get anyone else even though I think he could if he just tried. But at the same time it's my ring she obviously stole the ring originally there is absolutely no other way she could have ended up with it. I don't have a common name and her name is no where near the same as mine.", "He is the thief, not her.", "I'm curious what else has disappeared while she's been a guest in your parents' home.", "Sounds like she steals so much that even she can't keep track.", "> You would think since I had it on she would have kept her mouth shut and played dumb.\n\nThat's why I'd **never believe** that she stole it herself. It would have been so easy to remain silent. It would have been a natural reaction of somebody with a bad conscience.\n\nThe ring had been gifted to her before, and now after she had broken up with him and the ring had vanished from her, she was under the impression that he had taken it away from her.\n\nThat's why she exploded when she saw it again. Her freaking out was in fact meant for him, accusing him of 'stealing' her gift from her.", ">Or she just acted like thief posing as an innocent victim\n\nNot quite logical.\n\nImagine if she had been the thief. She got a ring with another woman's name engraved. Later the ring vanishes from her. Then she sees the ring on another woman's hand.\n\nShe must know immediately that the ring is now on the rightful owner's hand. She cannot believe that she can get it 'back' again by whatever trick or story.", "I think ultimately your brother might be better off without her. She sounds emotionally abusive.", "That seems like the answer that makes the most sense if there isn't anything else weird happening? Head trauma is no joke.\n\nI'm glad that you got that back, but as far as I can tell every jewelry thief that keeps the stolen stuff seems to be a complete basket case.", "Tell your brother not to worry. If she breaks up with him over this issue, then there will no longer be a reason for you to not report this theft to the police. ;-)", "Your brother's dating life is not yours to arrange for him. And in any case, shes not going to leave him over this because she is only saying that to manipulate him. And if she *does* leave him because she stole from *someone else*, then your brother is far far better off without her.", "OP states she believes girlfriend stole it.", "He's not - if he was the one who stole it, her reaction on finding out would be embarrassment, not continuing to insist on having it.", "I asked my mom the same thing so she's going to go through her jewelry box and other items and just double check. Nothing else of mine went missing that I know of but I also moved out a few months later. I will say the reason for the breakup was partially because of her behavior after my sibling accident but also because he kept having missing pain meds and she would try to gas light him into believing he must have just taken more then he thought even though we kept and eye on all his meds.", "Why would she lie that her kid gifted it to her then?\n\n>That's why I'd never believe that she stole it herself. It would have been so easy to remain silent.\n\nThis is easily explained by the gf forgetting that it was OP she had stolen it from in the first place, plus a healthy dose of projection. The gf steals, so she can easily believe that other people would steal too.", "Definitely. I'm sorry if he can't see it that way for the moment, but I do think it has to be better for him to be without a girlfriend than to be with one like that.", "My brother and I already have a rocky relationship where I recently decided to have low contact with him so I don't really speak to him unless I'm visiting my parents (for other reasons besides this) but I just feel like this might be the final straw for any sort of relationship. I do feel bad for him because I know he has low self esteem and is depressed so a break up won't help the situation. I also fully realize that I struggle to fully cut ties or feel any emotion because I was the one whose always took care of him after his accident and basically did everything for him because he almost died so I find it difficult to not care.", ">OP states she believes girlfriend stole it.\n\n\n\nI know :-)", "If he wants to stop talking to you to desperately date a thief...then oh well. You can't feel guilty about making the right choices for you.", "NTA, she\u2019s a thief, she can go out and buy her own damn ring", "NTA\n\nNot in a million years.", "Ask your brother if he really wants to be with a thief. This is ridiculous it has your name!", "NTA. She's a thief.", "NTA\n\nFrom the OP\u2019s other comments I think the ring is one major part of a bigger issue.", "NTA.\nBros GF is a thief\n\nWhy is this even a question", "No. She stole it. She was probably jealous of OP. These people will lie right to your face and then double down when you call them out with evidence. It's frankly baffling. \n\nThey live in a fantasy world where they can't handle all the bad stuff they are so they project it onto everyone else. It's pretty simple. And for those of us who're familiar with it, pretty typical. I'm not surprised she acted like this. I've seen similar situations before.\n\nNTA", "Just wondering if your brother could also have taken it and then give it his gf as a present?", "And you're sure your brother didn't steal it to give to her? Which one of them seems like they are more likely to be dumb enough to steal a ring with your name engraved on it?", "> I feel bad because my sibling has very low self-esteem\n\nHow dating a known thief and liar would help raise his self-esteem ?", "\n>They live in a fantasy world where they can't handle all the bad stuff they are so they project it onto everyone else. \n\n\n\nThis is so sick and sad...", "Her 'attitude' was meant for him. Accusing him. She thinks it was him who took it away from her.", "I wondered that as well. Would explain why she's saying she'll leave him.", "I thought the same. Especially with the brother's comments, sounds like, \"She'll leave me if she finds out I stole the ring.\" He could be trying to lie his way out, but his lie hinges on getting the ring back (\"misunderstanding\").\n\nI think it's the less likely explanation, but still possible. OP is in the clear either way though. Either the girlfriend is a thief, which would be bad for brother, or brother is a lying thief, which would be bad for girlfriend. Or they're both lying thieves, and are perfect for each other.\n\nThe point being, it isn't a relationship OP should be trying to protect.", "What are you talking about? How could OP showing her that it's OP's ring, make the gf think that OP's brother took it back?", "Yeah, her kid gave her a ring and she didn't ask where it came from? I was thinking OP's brother took it but now I think the GF stole it.", "Yea I mean has he even offered any solutions to make this right? If he thinks he\u2019s such a loser that he can\u2019t get anyone else, then he can at least offer to buy you another ring (which you shouldn\u2019t accept) or just get her another one\n\nHe can ruin his own life by continuing w this woman"]}
