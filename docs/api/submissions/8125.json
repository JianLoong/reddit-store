No one needs someone who steals from family.", "I think this is just how she behaves. She has a history from the first time they dated where she would gas light him into thinking he was wrong constantly. My sibling was in a bad accident before this happened and he had a brain injury that for a while messed up his memory. For example we had issues where some of his medications went missing even though both my mom and myself kept track of his meds but she would convince him he took more then he thought he did. I also considered that she is going to this extreme because there are pictures of them together and she is wearing the ring so he would have noticed I was wearing the same ring. I'm giving my sibling the benefit of the doubt that he truly didn't realize it was my ring because his accident really did mess up his memory. My parents and I both told my brother if she leaves that is on her because she messed up not him and he doesn't need to be with a thief, my parents also don't want her at their house anymore because of it. My brother is just struggling with mental health and his self esteem, my brother and I also don't currently have the best relationship right now for other reasons.", "I do not think my sibling stole just because at the time he just got home from the hospital after a bad accident and could not get around on his own (he was basically bed bound and the accident is the cause of the low self esteem). The accident is the reason the girlfriend was around so much at the time.", "If the brother was the one who stole it, the gf would be mortified on finding out it's OP's, not still demanding to have it.", "I think it is absolutely possible that he did not know because for one it has been so long and for two he was in a bad accident not to long before it was missing and had a traumatic brain injury from it he does have some memory issues from it.

It would have been a natural reaction of somebody with a bad conscience.\n\nThe ring had been gifted to her before, and now after she had broken up with him and the ring had vanished from her, she was under the impression that he had taken it away from her.\n\nThat's why she exploded when she saw it again. Her freaking out was in fact meant for him, accusing him of 'stealing' her gift from her.", ">Or she just acted like thief posing as an innocent victim\n\nNot quite logical.\n\nImagine if she had been the thief. She got a ring with another woman's name engraved. Later the ring vanishes from her. Then she sees the ring on another woman's hand.\n\nShe must know immediately that the ring is now on the rightful owner's hand.

It would have been so easy to remain silent.\n\nThis is easily explained by the gf forgetting that it was OP she had stolen it from in the first place, plus a healthy dose of projection.

She was probably jealous of OP. These people will lie right to your face and then double down when you call them out with evidence. It's frankly baffling. \n\nThey live in a fantasy world where they can't handle all the bad stuff they are so they project it onto everyone else. It's pretty simple.

Especially with the brother's comments, sounds like, \"She'll leave me if she finds out I stole the ring.\" He could be trying to lie his way out, but his lie hinges on getting the ring back (\"misunderstanding\").\n\nI think it's the less likely explanation, but still possible. OP is in the clear either way though. Either the girlfriend is a thief, which would be bad for brother, or brother is a lying thief, which would be bad for girlfriend. Or they're both lying thieves, and are perfect for each other.\n\nThe point being, it isn't a relationship OP should be trying to protect.", "What are you talking about? How could OP showing her that it's OP's ring, make the gf think that OP's brother took it back?", "Yeah, her kid gave her a ring and she didn't ask where it came from? I was thinking OP's brother took it but now I think the GF stole it.", "Yea I mean has he even offered any solutions to make this right?

Then call the cops.", "NTA but likely your sibling stole it to give to his gf so she wouldn't leave him.", "NTA\n\nYour sibling can buy her her own ring, but would be pretty stupid to do so.", "DO NOT GIVE IT BACK. Tell your brother you don't negotiate with thieves and terrorists. NTA", "It's engraved with your name, how is she even attempting to argue it's hers? \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. Are you sure that your brother didn\u2019t find the ring and give it to her?", "NTA. Maybe she never saw the names engraved on the ring? What did she say after it was pointed out?", "NTA. She\u2019s leaving him because his whole family knows she\u2019s a thief (there\u2019s really no coming back from that) unless you somehow disprove it by letting her have the ring.", "NTA! She's a thief and a drama queen at it. In my mother tongue there's an expression that goes \"a thief that steals from another thief gets a 100-year pardon\". You're forgiven", "NTA\n\n\nIf she was even a little bit intelligent she would have mentioned she had a similar ring and back off", "NTA - from the reaction of the brother I'm wondering if he's the one that took the ring and gave it to her", "NTA. The brother is OK she's a thief. Are you sure he didn't give it to her? Not much of a loss if she leaves.", "NTA - Who wants a thief in the family anyways?  It was ENGRAVED ffs. Dusted and done.", "NTA", "NTA Your brother would be better off without her.", "She\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t call the police. The brother can do better than her, just because he\u2019s got health issues doesn\u2019t mean he needs to settle for a thief and a liar. NTA.", "I understand this might be the end of your relationship with your brother but your partner gave that to you. Your partner put your names on it. Do they have an opinion here because I would be a little upset. NTA.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry your brother feels he has to settle for a thief and a liar. There has to be someone else out there for him so he doesn\u2019t have to settle for her. The ring is yours. It was yours all those years ago, during the time she had it and it\u2019s yours now. Just because she was still wearing it doesn\u2019t make the ring hers. Keep the ring. Try to convince your brother he has more worth and will find the right woman but that his current GF is not who he should be with.", "NTA. It literally has your name on it. The fact that she's fighting this screams delusion.", "NTA", "NTA. The brother needs to get out of his relationship asap. Stealing a ring \\*engraved with someone else's name\\* is on a whole new level. She knew it was OP's  but tried to keep it anyway. She's nasty, trying to manipulate the sibling into getting OP to return the ring. When it's not even hers! That's just horridly manipulative and a major red flag. If she keeps the ring and the girlfriend leaves, OP should pat herself on the back for doing herself, and her sibling, a favor.", "NTA. Lawless good thief", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t steal your own belongings!\n\nAnd if she does dump your brother over this, it\u2019s a blessing for you all.", "NTA.\n\nKeep your ring, it literally has you and your Husband's names engraved on it.\n\nEither she stole it, or your Brother stole it and gave it to her.\n\nEither way, if this causes them to break up, it sounds like you'd be doing him a favour in the long run.", "NAH She knows it\u2019s your ring, and is just trying to deflect so she doesn\u2019t look like the bad guy. I\u2019m Sure you would have said something if you had realized she stole it and why would you return it? It\u2019s YOUR ring. Evidenced by the engraving? I\u2019m still confused how she is explaining her ring being engraved with your (uncommon) name?", "YTA: But not because you took back your own property, rather because you're making a garbage excuse for it. Your brother's physical problems are unfortunate. This does not excuse theft, and you should not want to see him with someone who behaves this way.", "Nope, OP said that she answered that her child gave it to her. Her child had never been at OP's house at the time", "Why's it NAH? OP isn't to blame in any way here but the other girl is, at the very least for her continuing the blow-up once she was shown OP's name engraved on the ring", "She probably steals thing regularly and doesn't keep track.", "Another thought is that your brother stole it and gave it to her, but it doesn't matter it is yours.\n\nNTA", "That's because most likely your brother stole it and gave it to her as a gift.  So she saw you wearing a  ring she was given.", "It sounds like she knows he's emotionally vulnerable as per OP's comment that he finds it hard to get GFs. Therefore she's holding all the cards; or certainly a very strong hand. He'd rather keep her than admit she's a thief. Very sad for him.", "Yeah we're living the age of inverted morality lmao", "Oof your brother is ripe to be in an abusive relationship. If he has such low self esteem, he should be single and work on his mental health.", "If your brother has low self esteem, surely the last thing he needs is a dishonest gf?", "So he\u2019d rather date a thief and a liar than be alone? Do you think maybe your brother found it and gave it to her?", "She's a liar......have zip to do with her ever again.", "My cousin had a TBI from a car accident and her first husband played the \"I'm such a good guy to marry a woman with memory issues\" card.  Yeah  he was awful and has continued to be after the divorce (he hides income to avoid child support  uses the kids to control her).  My cousin deserved better and so does your brother.", "Surely she would have noticed the engraving in that case and thought \u201cwhy the hell is my boyfriend gifting me a ring with his sisters name on it?\u201d", "ohhh good point! Didn't even think of that!", "This is exactly what I was thinking too.", "It was engraved with his sister\u2019s name and her husband\u2019s, so no, that didn\u2019t happen.", "Why would anyone want a thief in their family?", "But then, knowing it was stolen and belings to his sister, OP, why woul she want it back?", "OP don\u2019t give the ring back. Her leaving him over it is the best thing that could happen out of the situation I think\u2026 NTA", "Ohhh better off single than with this thief ! I feel for your brother, she was even taking his meds!!! You all need to get this person out of your lives.", "Your brother should get a support group (therapist) and ditch that b***h. I knew a girl who acted  much the same way and she stole my dirty laundry. He needs to be careful", "OP, how long ago was this? Were they together for a decade like your and your husband?", "Your whole family should tell her, by, adios, don't let the door hit your azz on the way out...thief.", "That's just not even funny. If you gaslight someone about how many pills they've taken (I myself take about six different medications and need help remembering what to take when), that can turn into dangerous medical problems, be they chronic or an emergency. \n\nShe sounds like a real piece of work. Give her the boot and change the locks.", "So either she\u2019s a junkie or a dealer too. Excellent. NTA.", "She didn't even know that she was recovering a stolen item yet! She was still under the assumption that it had been lost. Ridiculous to claim stealing, she thought her dad had found the ring that was obviously hers.", "The brother may not have noticed the engraving so yes, it could have happened.", "Your relationship was already over when he took a thief's side. Imagine you let it go, do you think she'll never steal from you again? Or your family? Because she's willing to pull this while everyone clearly knows it's yours, she's not going to stop. That will enable her and therefore keep your brother with an abuser. You will be participating in the enabling by letting it go.", "Send him to a therapist.", ">But then, knowing it was stolen and belings to his sister, OP, why woul she want it back?\n\nI'm not sure if she seriously expected to get it back. But that's the second thing.\n\nAt first she was accusing him, like Exes often accuse each other in many ways and for many things - reasonable or not. That's how I am reading this 'freaking out'.", "NTA. Your name is literally on it. The girlfriend of your brother sounds horrible and manipulative.", ">Why would anyone want to be with her after knowing that ?   \n\nLoneliness", "If the gf took it, why is she staying after being outed as  thief.   If brother took it, why is she insisting on getting it back knowing it was stolen.  Neither of these makes sense, so maybe it's all made up?", "Are you a bot ? This comment is like a reworded copy of [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jymsl/comment/j5nftzc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).", "This isn't just loneliness though, it's a huge lack of self esteem and self respect.\n\nThere are a lot of lonely people in the world who would rather stay lonely than settle for a thief, abuser, and gaslighter.", "I agree that not everybody was making sense there LOL"]}
