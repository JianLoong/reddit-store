No one needs someone who steals from family.", "I think this is just how she behaves. She has a history from the first time they dated where she would gas light him into thinking he was wrong constantly. My sibling was in a bad accident before this happened and he had a brain injury that for a while messed up his memory. For example we had issues where some of his medications went missing even though both my mom and myself kept track of his meds but she would convince him he took more then he thought he did. I also considered that she is going to this extreme because there are pictures of them together and she is wearing the ring so he would have noticed I was wearing the same ring. I'm giving my sibling the benefit of the doubt that he truly didn't realize it was my ring because his accident really did mess up his memory. My parents and I both told my brother if she leaves that is on her because she messed up not him and he doesn't need to be with a thief, my parents also don't want her at their house anymore because of it. My brother is just struggling with mental health and his self esteem, my brother and I also don't currently have the best relationship right now for other reasons.", "I do not think my sibling stole just because at the time he just got home from the hospital after a bad accident and could not get around on his own (he was basically bed bound and the accident is the cause of the low self esteem). The accident is the reason the girlfriend was around so much at the time.", "If the brother was the one who stole it, the gf would be mortified on finding out it's OP's, not still demanding to have it.", "I think it is absolutely possible that he did not know because for one it has been so long and for two he was in a bad accident not to long before it was missing and had a traumatic brain injury from it he does have some memory issues from it.

It would have been so easy to remain silent. It would have been a natural reaction of somebody with a bad conscience.\n\nThe ring had been gifted to her before, and now after she had broken up with him and the ring had vanished from her, she was under the impression that he had taken it away from her.\n\nThat's why she exploded when she saw it again. Her freaking out was in fact meant for him, accusing him of 'stealing' her gift from her.", ">Or she just acted like thief posing as an innocent victim\n\nNot quite logical.\n\nImagine if she had been the thief. She got a ring with another woman's name engraved. Later the ring vanishes from her. Then she sees the ring on another woman's hand.\n\nShe must know immediately that the ring is now on the rightful owner's hand.

Nothing else of mine went missing that I know of but I also moved out a few months later. I will say the reason for the breakup was partially because of her behavior after my sibling accident but also because he kept having missing pain meds and she would try to gas light him into believing he must have just taken more then he thought even though we kept and eye on all his meds.", "Why would she lie that her kid gifted it to her then?\n\n>That's why I'd never believe that she stole it herself. It would have been so easy to remain silent.\n\nThis is easily explained by the gf forgetting that it was OP she had stolen it from in the first place, plus a healthy dose of projection.

She was probably jealous of OP. These people will lie right to your face and then double down when you call them out with evidence. It's frankly baffling. \n\nThey live in a fantasy world where they can't handle all the bad stuff they are so they project it onto everyone else. It's pretty simple.

Especially with the brother's comments, sounds like, \"She'll leave me if she finds out I stole the ring.\" He could be trying to lie his way out, but his lie hinges on getting the ring back (\"misunderstanding\").\n\nI think it's the less likely explanation, but still possible. OP is in the clear either way though. Either the girlfriend is a thief, which would be bad for brother, or brother is a lying thief, which would be bad for girlfriend. Or they're both lying thieves, and are perfect for each other.\n\nThe point being, it isn't a relationship OP should be trying to protect.", "What are you talking about? How could OP showing her that it's OP's ring, make the gf think that OP's brother took it back?", "Yeah, her kid gave her a ring and she didn't ask where it came from? I was thinking OP's brother took it but now I think the GF stole it.", "Yea I mean has he even offered any solutions to make this right? If he thinks he\u2019s such a loser that he can\u2019t get anyone else, then he can at least offer to buy you another ring (which you shouldn\u2019t accept) or just get her another one\n\nHe can ruin his own life by continuing w this woman", "Obviously NTA. \n\nImagine having the audacity to still want something back when everyone knows you stole said item.

She stole your property. You took it back. She's a liar and a thief. Your brother is better single than with someone that steals from his family or that steals his prescription drugs.

Keep it!

I don't know who did steal it, could be either or both, but girlfriend seems more likely with the story as presented.\n\nSide note, there's cognitive dissonance as well. \"Stealing is bad, bad people steal. I'm a good person, so I didn't steal anything.\" People don't like to admit to that, even to themselves.", "She definitely stole it. She took the ring off which is how OP got it back in the first place, meaning it\u2019s probably not the first time she\u2019s took it off, and if the ring was nice enough to steal that means she also has inspected it, she\u2019s seen the engraving already.
