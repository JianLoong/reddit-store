It will be me and my partners first holiday as a family with our babies. I haven\u2019t left the country since I was a kid and my partner has never left the country at all. My parents now want to bring my young niece with them on the holiday which I told them from the start was a bad idea. She\u2019s too young to be away from her mother in a different country and it\u2019s not a very kid friendly area (no theme parks or water parks, playgrounds etc). I told them before they booked my nieces flight that I wasn\u2019t going to be responsible for her. If they wanted to bring her then she\u2019s in their care the whole holiday as I didn\u2019t want to be responsible for my sisters child in another country, also I have my own babies to take care of and it\u2019s my first family holiday so I want to spend time with my partner and children, which they agreed to. I tried to have a discussion with my mother about it yesterday as I still feel like bringing her is a bad idea (whenever I\u2019m babysitting her in my home she wants her mom within two hours of her mom dropping her off) My mother did show concern about this but wants to bring her nonetheless. I also explained to her that I won\u2019t be babysitting my niece at night either as I have my own babies to take care of and I know my parents will try and leave my niece with me every night so they can go drinking so I urged my mother to really think this through as one/both of them will have to stay in the apartment with my niece and not go out. My mother lost it and called me selfish for not taking my niece at nighttime and hung up the phone. I called my sister and explained the situation to her and she agreed and said that it\u2019s unfair of my parents to expect me to take my niece at night as I have my hands full with my own babies and my parents are the ones who wanted to bring her so they can be responsible for her, end of. I\u2019m usually a big pushover with my family and I usually give them their way for an easy life but I\u2019m adamant about this as I didn\u2019t want my niece to go from the start so I don\u2019t see why I should be responsible for her while they go out. I feel like if they wanted this to be a drinking/partying holiday then they really don\u2019t have any business bringing my young niece along.

Your mom wants the fun of having her other granddaughter around, but wants to unload her on you when she has had enough. That's not your problem.\n\nPerhaps they should bring both your sister and her daughter.", "NTA. Your parents are being incredibly selfish.", "NTA\n\nYou knew exactly what your mother was scheming and you called her on it. Great way to set and enforce boundaries.", "NTA.  Go on a different trip and leave the grandkid crazy by day/alcoholic by night parents at home.  Notable that it was the drinking thing that made mom blow up.  Makes me wonder about their effectiveness as babysitters the mornings after.", "NTA. The only reason to vacation with your parents is for them to help you out with your two babies. Mom not only doesn't want to do that, but she also wants to saddle you with your niece. I don't see an upside for you in this plan.\n\n\nEnjoy your vacation with babies and hubby. Without parents.", "You could just not go?", "Nta", "Girl if the baby is going you need to not be going or to have housing fully separated from them", "NTA\u2026.if your sister agrees with you, knows her daughter wants her after two hours, why is she even allowing her child to be taken in said trip?   If you all go together, stick to your boundaries.  Do not let mom take advantage.  Is dad aware of this situation?  Is he aware of your boundaries?", "NTA take a separate vacation", "That\u2019s exactly my point! I told her before she booked my nieces flight and I\u2019ve told her numerous times since that my niece is her responsibility and I won\u2019t be taking care of her since she wanted to bring her and she always agreed but now that I told her I won\u2019t babysit her at night so she can go out, she\u2019s getting mad. I\u2019ve been to this location as a child before and it\u2019s not kid friendly at all. Luckily my sister and I had each other to make our own fun but my niece will be by herself unless she makes a little friend over there and that\u2019s not guaranteed either. I said that to my mother too that she\u2019s too young and will most likely complain to being bored the whole holiday which isn\u2019t fair on the poor girl either. I\u2019m genuinely considering cancelling my flight but the woman we\u2019re staying with is a family friend and hasn\u2019t seen me since I was my nieces age and she is so looking forward to seeing me and meeting my babies so I\u2019d feel really guilty if I didn\u2019t go.", "I know I\u2019m in two minds now. I\u2019m considering just cancelling my flight and going somewhere else with my partner and babies.

She owns her own holiday apartment block and cleared the dates of our stay so it would just be us staying there. She lost her only child when I was a baby in a car accident and her husband died last year so she\u2019s all alone now so we all made a plan to go visit her. It was supposed to be my parents, my brother and his girlfriend and my sister and her boyfriend and her child and myself and my partner and our twins but my brother had to pull out due to work commitments, my sister obviously foresaw that there was going to be arguments so she pulled out and my parents were mortified to have to tell her that my brother and sister weren\u2019t coming so after this lovely woman clearing her calendar for that week to accommodate us and with her being so excited to see me again and meet my twins I wouldn\u2019t feel right not going but I will be having a serious conversation with my mother about the holiday and if she continues to fight me on this then I won\u2019t be going.", "Could you change the dates so you would be going at a different time from your parents? \n\nOr if the budget will stretch, could you book somewhere separate to stay and let the friend know you'd love to spend some time with them but also want to have a bit of space just as a family (i.e. you and your partner and babies)  That way,it's much harder for your parents to dump your niece on you (especially if you don't share your address with them / don't answer the door if they show up uninvited )", "This is the best choice by far. You just know if your arguing now about what boundaries are, imagine how much worse it will be when your there and your mom realizes you meant every word and she can't change your mind/get her own way? Its not worth it. Not even a little. Make plans with your family friend to come at a different time, can your flight, and do not tell your mother your new plans. Fall outs better to deal with on your home terf, not in a foreign country. NTA and i hope you have the best time ever with your hubs and lil ones.", "NTA that would be best and less stressful. Please explain this to the family friend and ask if you can visit at another time.\n\nIt would also be a warning for the friend - considering your mother entitlements the friend might be voluntold to be your niece's babysitter and she CAN put her foot down and say no to bringing the niece.", "I'm very sorry for your family friend's losses, but what has that got to do with anything?", "Because she\u2019s lonely and she\u2019s been looking forward to seeing me and meeting my babies she said she\u2019s counting down the days so I\u2019d feel bad if I didn\u2019t go", "We all know what's going to happen if you do go though. You'll end up looking after your neice and resenting your parents. So, you need to decide what's more important."]}
