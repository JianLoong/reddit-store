We\u2019ve been married for 8yrs and we have three boys. Eli (15m) is my stepson but I love him like he\u2019s mine, and we have our two younger sons 7m & 5m. I\u2019m currently pregnant with baby number four, and this is definitely the last one lol.\n\nMy MIL Grace (63f) has been staying with us for a little while since her house is currently being renovated.\n\nSince I\u2019ve been in Eli\u2019s life since he was little, my MIL more or less holds me responsible for every perceived \u201cmistake\u201d he has ever made. Anytime he disagrees with her, freely speaks his mind, or just does something she doesn\u2019t like, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s \u201cblamed\u201d for it.\nI will be honest, I do encourage Eli to express how he feels, to be sure in what he believes, and that as long as no one is getting hurt by it then he can do what he wants. I encourage my other boys to do that too. All I want is for them to be happy.\n\nThis morning, my husband had already gone into work, and the younger boys were at the table eating with Grace. I was getting their lunches packed up and put into their bags when Eli came down.\nHe was wearing an oversized pink button down and flared jeans, and he had on some really pretty green eyeshadow.\n\nGrace immediately started talking about how he was dressed way too girly for a boy, that he needed to take the makeup off. Grace then turned to me and said \u201caren\u2019t you going to tell him he looks ridiculous?\u201d\n\nSo I looked at Eli and told him that he looked cute but the green eyeshadow didn\u2019t match his outfit that well so next time he should try pink or neutrals. He smiled a little and went to put on his shoes while I got the younger boys backpacks so we could go to the car.\n\nAs soon as Eli was gone, Grace told me that I was being purposely difficult and that since Eli isn\u2019t my son, it\u2019s not my place to allow him to just do whatever he wants. I told her that if she really felt like I wasn\u2019t his mother, then it made no sense for her to ask me to discipline him for wearing eyeshadow.\n\nI took the kids to school, and on my way back home my husband called to ask what happened this morning with his mother. I told him, and he said that I could have just asked Eli to take it off instead of doing something that was going to irritate Grace further. So clearly both he and his mother think I messed up, just for different reasons.\n\nETA:\n\nI agree guys, pink and green is a very lovely combination! However, he had on forest green eyeshadow and a light pink shirt, which was cute don\u2019t get me wrong, but I just think pink eyeshadow would have been a little more cohesive.\n\nThat aside, I wanted to add that I talked to Eli during his lunch period at school and he said he appreciated how I handled the situation and he doesn\u2019t mind me giving him other fashion tips lol.\n\nI also will be having a conversation with my husband about setting boundaries with his mother when he gets home from work.", "created_utc": 1669656660, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z72lqb/aita_for_telling_my_step_son_that_his_eyeshadow/", "score": 5142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure Grace was salivating with anticipation with the impending parental telling off, but no you handled it like and adult with a little humor. Kudos.

Your husband by not backing you up and Grace for sticking her nose where it didn't belong. \n\nIf Eli likes dabbling with make up, have him get his colors done at a place like Ulta.

I generally agree with you; if it doesn't hurt anyone, a kid (or anyone) should feel comfortable to express themselves as they see fit. It would be one thing if your stepson's dad had explicitly stated that he was not comfortable with your stepson wearing eyeshadow, but even then, it should be a conversation between the two of you to determine what is best for the kid and what your respective roles are in regards to parenting decisions.

If he's looking for a more subtle day wear, I'd do a very light, subtle to the point of almost indetectable green if I wanted to do that combo. With a light pink shirt, that would be perfect.\n\nIt's a matter of preference, but OP's reply also opens up a doorway to discussing those preferences to help find looks he wants, too, which is why it's such a good one.

You accept him as he is; she does not.  I don't care if her house just burned down, let her go stay with one of her other children or rent her a cheap air B&B but get her out of your house and away from Eli.  A boy who wears green eye shadow to school doesn't need his grandmother curling her lip and telling him he looks too girly.  Please talk to your husband and figure out a plan to get Grace out of there.  (Having her there is bad for you too, but the badness for Eli overshadows that.)", "NTA but do feel free to tell your husband to sit this one out and GO OFF on MIL.  Tell him you\u2019ll handle it and put her in her place.", "NTA! OP, YOU ARE AMAZING!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "NTA - you are correct, if he was going to wear green eye shadow with a light pink shirt, then a lighter, more lime colour would probably look better. Colorpop has some great lighter green options you could explore together.", "I love that you not only didn't bat an eyelash, but also gave a little fashion tip to boot. That makes a great mom!", "I would have told my husband to please come back home and help his mama pack. \"She needs to be somewhere that I am not. So, hook her up honey.\"\ud83d\ude02", "You played it so smoothly and sweetly! Grace is unkind and her outdated prejudices have no place in your home. I bet Eli told all his friends at school how awesome you are and how cool in shutting  down Grandma DisGrace!", "Forest green is a very tough color to pull off though.  Not many people look good with it on their face.  I would think a medium or dark blue--depending on his skin tone--would be more appropriate.", "Exactly! Makeup is not necessarily to enhance what is natural, sometimes unnaturally fantastic colors and application is the point. Besides he\u2019s a teenager, and he should be allowed to experiment all he wants.", "Yes but look at how appeasement worked for Neville Chamberlin.", "I just teared up at this!  And I\u2019m not even chopping onions!!!", "Yeah, purple and green are amazing tones to mix too! (Said by someone that only wear black, blue or cold grey lol).", "Oh I remember a TikTok user that works with make-up and explains why the color wheel is important as well, since some skin tones (warm, neutral or cold) can or not improve with the make-up, specially the concealers or problems like red skin (using a BB cream with green tinte helps to tint the skin).", "I agree and I like how Eli went pretty happy like \"oh she's right that the forest green doesn't match with a neon pink\". But if he's more interested in colors for eye shades or lipsticks, OP should seek a color wheel for make-up and how colors will affect if Eli has warm, neutral or cold tone skin. If he's into flash colors, Decora or Japanese urban fashion is a good reference too.", "Yeah, I wear green though, but I definitely use a lot of black!!!!", "It is a good suggestion!", "Black is the best neutral color to combine with everything, specially pastel tones or darker tones.", "My mother was physically and mentally abused by her mother. She grew up in a generation where you didn't go talk about it. She also suffered with post parturm depression. Again not much help at the time. \nWhile she has always done her best to be a good mother, her past experiences still affect her now.\nIt's very simple to say my mother should deal with her trauma. It's alot more difficult to actually do.", "NTA. You handled it well. Don\u2019t make a bigger issue than necessary. I\u2019m sure Eli is fine - who wants their grandmother to like the way they are dressed, anyway? You can always just say, that\u2019s the style now and I think it\u2019s healthy. If MIL wants to make comments, so be it. She\u2019ll only damage her relationship with this lovely young man.", "[removed]", "Found the tiktok! territomlinsonmakeup!", "Dealing with trauma is absolutely NOT an easy thing to do. I would never suggest it is. But, as I said, at a certain point one has to deal with it or they are likely to traumatize and hurt others. For the cycle of abuse to stop, it takes someone to make the extremely difficult choice to stop it and continue to make that choice."]}
