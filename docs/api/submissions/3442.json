I encourage my other boys to do that too. All I want is for them to be happy.\n\nThis morning, my husband had already gone into work, and the younger boys were at the table eating with Grace.

I told her that if she really felt like I wasn\u2019t his mother, then it made no sense for her to ask me to discipline him for wearing eyeshadow.\n\nI took the kids to school, and on my way back home my husband called to ask what happened this morning with his mother. I told him, and he said that I could have just asked Eli to take it off instead of doing something that was going to irritate Grace further.

I generally agree with you; if it doesn't hurt anyone, a kid (or anyone) should feel comfortable to express themselves as they see fit. It would be one thing if your stepson's dad had explicitly stated that he was not comfortable with your stepson wearing eyeshadow, but even then, it should be a conversation between the two of you to determine what is best for the kid and what your respective roles are in regards to parenting decisions.
