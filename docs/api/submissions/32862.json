If you live in an area that has these, you can totally just schedule one ahead of time and be good to go. \n\nIf worst comes to worst, someone can also call the sleep lab ahead of time and see if it\u2019s possible if your MIL can arrive ahead of time. Since she\u2019s a 9:30 pm patient, I\u2019m assuming that they stagger their patient arrival times so that the Sleep Technologists can give more 1:1 time to their patients to hook up electrodes, but it\u2019s also somewhat common for patients to arrive reasonably early as long as they know that they will still be seen at their regularly scheduled time (so she would likely just have to sit in her bedroom and watch TV/read a book/whatever until the Tech is done with their first patient or so). Try to see when they truly open for patients (like is it 8 pm, 9 pm, etc.) and see if there\u2019s a compromise here because, as mentioned, it\u2019s totally pointless for you both to go.", "INFO: Is there some reason you can't just watch it later?

This was likely schedule way ahead of time. It sounds like she just asked him today. That\u2019s extremely rude. She should have coordinated with him as soon as her mom asked her for help.", "> My husband did it because he chose to my grandson does it because he chooses to I don\u2019t even ask him.\n\nJudging by all your shaming in this thread, I guarantee they didn't \"choose\" to, you just guilt-tripped them to death", "Im not a nurse and have been paid to take part in 3 different sleep studies. I have no underlying health issues whatsoever.", "No. It\u2019s his mother in law doing the study. The wife volunteered to drive. This had nothing to do with OP. If his wife is this fragile, she should not have volunteered to drive. Her mother, also an adult, could have figured out another solution. \n\nMy mother is likely your age if not older sans managed herself just fine. For two adult women ,who live in a culture where they are apparently allowed to drive, to have an issue solving this problem is\u2026 sad. \n\nIt\u2019s not an issue of chivalry in his part. (It\u2019s 2023) More of being inconsiderate on hers. \n\nBut I also don\u2019t know their dynamic. Perhaps she is used to playing a fragile female role in their relationship. And if that\u2019s what they usually do, OP should capitulate. \n\nBut, man, I dislike having close relationships with codependent people. Silly stuff like this is why.", "Exactly. So no woman should ever leave the house without a man in the car. Is that what you\u2019re positing?", "YES.", "The thing is that it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s her timing that\u2019s the problem - she sprung it on him the night before. Which means she scheduled it without talking to him, assuming that he\u2019d do it. If you\u2019re going to have to rely on someone for assistance, for whatever reason, you need to discuss it with that person in advance.", "I have no idea what you\u2019re quoting. This sub thread about people whose spouses are apparently holding ridiculous grudges is depressing to me.", "That WAS limiting yourself. I mean where were you going at night that was so dangerous?", "Oh, all of the dates were in February and March. But the point is that the wife had time to call him and ask him whether he was free to help before she committed him to run an errand for her mother.", "Oh, it can be an emergent medical appointment. If you\u2019re not breathing while you were sleeping, you could die that\u2019s why they do them.", "Someone else is arguing with me that it\u2019s just a Science experiment and I got down voted for saying it\u2019s medical", "No.. I'd rather not spend my time in that way. Thanks for the suggestion.", "Maybe he shouldn\u2019t be a dick", "They both need to learn to communicate.", ">husband doesnt need to be involved at all\n\nThat's just sad. I'll leave this at \"agree to disagree\".", "Well, because of her parents get older, we tend to do things for them. Maybe her mom don\u2019t drive anymore. Maybe she didn\u2019t think her husband would be an ass. I would\u2019ve done it for my mom. Actually, my husband would\u2019ve done it for my mom as well, I mean it\u2019s gonna take him the time to drive there the time to drive back you don\u2019t have to sit there and wait you just drop them off and leave. It\u2019s a sleep study.  they are done at night.

I replied a comment that stated OP's wife was trying to make OP drive MIL to the sleep study instead of herself which is not true.   \nThe reason why i think we need more info is that based on the information we have I dont think we can decide if OP is the AH or not. We can agree on what his wife did was wrong and call her TA but would you put your partner in danger just because they made a mistake of not discussing their plans with you in advance? If her actual safety at that neigborhood is the reason she is uncomfortable, wouldnt this make OP TA? Thats why i think we need more context.", "I didn\u2019t limit myself we lived around the Phoenix area. That should tell you something. Him and I always did everything together anyway. We even worked together.", "Yes, and they still schedule it like a regular medical appointment even if they suspect apnea.", "You don't die from sleep apnea lol what the fuck are you talking about right now crazy?", "He\u2019s not. It\u2019s not being a dick to not want to rearrange your own plans for something someone drops on you at the last minute.\n\nMy husband and I talk about things like this in advance so there aren\u2019t surprises or stupid arguments like this.\n\nShe is perfectly capable of driving by herself, she just doesn\u2019t want to. And if her \u201cnerves\u201d render her incapable of driving, then she never should have made the commitment in the first place.", "He's not being a dick.
