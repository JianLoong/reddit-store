My wife has shown no real desire to get back into the workforce, it is not like we are struggling per se, but I would be lying if I said I did not miss the extra income from when my wife was working. \n\nAbout a year into her leave, her sister became pregnant, which did take up a large portion of her free time. So over the last two years, my wife has been babysitting her niece for around 12 hours a day three days out the week. She is stressed but does it because her sister claims she has no other option, and cannot afford childcare. \n\nEven so, I do not think it is reasonable for my wife to do 12 hours a day for three days. So since my wife has not said anything for 2 years, I told my sister in law come next year she needs to go to daycare because I am not going to let my wife do what amounts to slave labor. \n\nMy sister-in-law told me it was not my place to say what my wife could and could not do. \n\nI get this POV, and I would be lying if I said I am not slightly miffed that my wife can work 36 hours a week three days a week for free but claims she is not ready to return to the workforce. \n\nThat is a separate issue, the core issue here is my sister-in-law is taking advantage of my wife to provide free child care. That is not okay. In the past, my wife did talk about pay, but my wife does not like to chase people for money, so since she never reminds them they claim to always forget. \n\nEither way, I told my sister-in-law this is where we stand. My wife is upset with me since she claims it is not my place to say what she can and cannot do. It is not my place to tell others how she is feeling. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nFor clarity's sake, I did talk this over with my wife many times. She is burnt out from watching her niece but in her view, her sister has no other option. \n\nShe has expressed how babysitting over these years combined with teaching has killed all desire she once had for having children of her own. \n\nAs mentioned my wife has spoken about pay but since she does not like to chase people for money she never gets the money. She feels she should not have to remind people of money, they should want to pay someone to help them especially when it comes to family. \n\nShe also is afraid her sister will become unstable if she loses her family support. I stepped in because I was sick of her being taken advantage of. I did not just sidestep her, I have tried many times over these years to put her foot down, but she loves her niece and does not want to see her suffer. \n\nMy point is she is destroying her mental health just like teaching. I was the one who encouraged her to quit because it was destroying her, all she did was wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. It was a struggle to get her to eat at times. \n\nThe same is happening with babysitting for my wife. \n\nOne last edit since people said I should mention it. My wife is not doing this alone. When I get some I do take over the last three hours and I drop the kid off at her mother's when she gets off work. \n\nWe also provide food, and child supplies such as diapers and pull-ups. My wife is also potty training my niece. She is more or less raising her niece three days out the week.", "created_utc": 1703813885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18tarfw/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_give_up_babysitting/", "score": 740, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Gas costs (your SIL can\u2019t even drop her off to free childcare? Tells me a lot.) Twelve hours a day is three meals and probably two snacks. Milk. I\u2019d be curious if your SIL even brought diapers and wipes when your niece needed them. Is your wife buying toys and stuff for your house to entertain your niece? Taking her places? If you add up all the expenses I\u2019m sure it\u2019s quite a bit. \n\nYour SIL is taking major advantage of your wife. Yes, your wife should say something, but since she seems to be unable to, I think it\u2019s fine for you to put a stop to it since it\u2019s costing you money and your wife\u2019s mental health.", "Maybe you can\u2019t tell your wife what she can and can\u2019t do, but you can absolutely refuse to fund all of the babysitting.

Stop allowing her to pay for all the food, supplies, and gas that is required to babysit (she's not just not getting paid for 36 hrs of work a week.... she's PAYING for the privilege of caring for her niece)  You are being a doormat to this extent as well.  You earn the money she's using.  Stop.\n\nStart couples therapy, not just for your marriage but so that you can tell some truths to her therapist.

No. If you both had a child, would one of you choose the name without input from the other? No. \n\nWhy? Because any big decisions that impact the family need to be made by the two of you acting as partners. Your wife should never have unilaterally made such a big decision to help your SIL without consulting with you. This is the type of decision that should only have been done with two yes' (if one of the partners says no, then it is a no for the married couple).\n\nAlot of people here are focusing on the fact that you needed to speak to your wife first before raising the issue with SIL. However, what they failed to address is the fact that your wife had no right to unilaterally make a HUGE decision that has negatively impacted your family for the past three years. \n\nYour SIL's selfishness has negatively impacted your family from a financial perspective (your wife has not been able to use the time to recover from her job as a teacher, and return to the work place where she can contribute to your household). And it has negatively impacted your family from a mental and emotional perspective (your wife is so tired and drained she no longer wants to have children).\n\nYou need to stop allowing your wife to unilaterally make big decisions that negatively impact your family. And you need to tell your selfish SIL that you (by \"you\" I am referring to your marriage partnership) will not be raising her children for her anymore.\n\nNTA", "OP, looks like you hit a nerve with all the single moms here..lol\nYour wife's health is the utmost concern here, which her sister doesn't give a shit about.

You\u2019re framing this in terms of not wanting to see your wife taken advantage of and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true. \n\nHowever, at this point your sister in law\u2019s choices about childcare are basically controlling your future- you\u2019re not going to have kids because she doesn\u2019t want to or can\u2019t pay for daycare. Also because your wife appears to have serious untreated or unresolved mental health issues. \n\nYou need to talk to your wife about how you feel about all of that. At this point you\u2019re doing more to take care of your wife than your wife is, and that\u2019s not sustainable. You need to talk to her and listen.\n\nIf this is just how she is then you need to decide if that\u2019s something you can live with for the rest of your life. I say this as someone who was married to a woman with serious mental health struggles for almost a decade. I was hanging in there trying to help her get better until something just snapped one day and I decided I couldn\u2019t want her to get better more than she did.

Wife has also expressed to me she is burnt out. I would much rather her be using her time to recharge and get back on the wagon and find her confidence again, than raising YOUR child. You either need to pay your sister accordingly for her time, or you need to do what everyone else in society does and pay for daycare. I will absolutely put my foot down on this as well, because I know you are taking advantage of your sister and she has expressed to me that she feels the same, but refuses to rock the boat because you won't act like a parent and take responsibility for finding care for your child. 12 hours a day for 3 days is beyond the pale, that's about $2,3000 a month she could be getting if she was atleast getting $16 an hour.

Difficult because your wife says she can\u2019t say anything while something clearly needs to be said to her sister, but this all comes down to communication and early intervention.\n\nAnother point for either just your wife or the two of you being TA is either your wife agreed to babysit her niece without asking you, in which she WBTA, or you both agreed but didn\u2019t put a time limit and boundaries on this babysitting, in which you would both BTA.\n\nA lot of the issues here stem from shitty communication between all parties. Have a discussion with your wife about how her continuing to agree with an arrangement that is destroying her mental health (and not even getting paid to do so), while she actively does nothing to help herself heal is getting to be too much. Her sister is abusing the help your wife offered and has no boundaries, because your wife doesn\u2019t cope with potential arguments. You are now the sole provider because your wife decided on her own that can\u2019t do any job ever again, despite essentially now working in childcare. Set some boundaries yourself because you are getting steamrolled by these two.", "People voting y t a, understand that OP already discussed this with his wife.

Both your time and money are tied up in this. She had a child she can't afford and will only send it to a top-of-the-line daycare. That isn't how that works. Where is the father? Why isn't child support covering at least some of the daycare? That is something she should be pursuing. She could also likely find a potentially less expensive in-home daycare where she could only pay for the 3 days she works. I know many regular businesses you have to pay for the spot rather than the days, but in home are sometimes more flexible. \n\nYou a little bit because you really need to word your concerns better and be clearer with your wife about your concerns. It isn't slave labor, she is volunteering, even if she says she doesn't want to, the point is that she IS. I think you two are past sugar-coating stuff though. What **you** need to point out is that you are willingly supporting your wife because you love her, and you agreed she could quit her job for her mental health.

ESPECIALLY when it is affecting her mental health, and thus your overall relationship. \n\nYour wife because she absolutely needs to grow a pair and stand up for herself. Either she is lying to you, or she is lying to her sister. Either way, she needs to be clear what she needs/wants beyond what anyone else is saying. \n\nMy guess is that this won't change unless you two sit down and discuss it at length. Potentially with a therapist. Even then, she may not be able to say no. At that point you will need to decide if you want to continue to financially support her and the child while she raises her sister's child 36h a week. \n\nI am somewhat curious though - you said she is now saying she doesn't want children of her own. Is that something you two discussed before marriage? That is kind of a big deal if you wanted children and now, she doesn't. That is definitely something to nail down asap (no idea how old you two are). If you still want children, it is possible she isn't equipped to handle them (if 36h of a child is this difficult on her, I can't imagine 24/7 being any easier). Is that a deal breaker?", "Is your wife in therapy? Because she needs to learn how to establish and enforce boundaries. She's a doormat and your SIL is taking advantage because she's used to taking advantage. \n\nShe also needs to look at retraining for something other than teaching.

The longer she\u2019s out of paid work the harder it is and the more she\u2019ll be stuck in low paid casual work. What if you split? She\u2019s totally screwed.

She clearly needs therapy to work on being able to set boundaries with those around her - including you and her sister. How about instead of pushing her into this 'for her own good' you help her learn how set boundaries and have the confidence to enforce them for herself.

Your wife seems incapable at this point of taking care of her own mental health; you stepped up to do it for her. I say this with no criticism of her at all. I would do the same thing, I\u2019d sacrifice my health for someone else, and it would probably be better for someone to help me help myself.

It's not just affecting her, it affects you and your relationship.", "Leaving her stuck in this situation, even worse than it already has been, is not conducive to any amicable ending here.", "I did stand up and I was called an asshole for it, and getting called an asshole here.", "She works three days a week, she is a food service representative at a hospital and she works two 6 hour shifts.", "Guess I am just different, my mother would beat me ass even as an adult if I let her watch a child for 12 hours, and did not provide supplies, food, and transportation. \n\nAlso, would you left your sister in law do that?", "The proof is my wife does feel she is being taken advantage of, but also feels it is not her place to tell someone, especially a family member they are taking advantage of they should know and not have to be told.\n\nShe also has asked her sister for pay but since she does not like to chase people for money she has never gotten paid. She feels people should want to pay others for their work and not have to be chased for it.", "I cannot answer if this is something she has spoken with her therapist directly, but yes she is aware of how I feel. In her case, it is rough because she is the oldest and she for the most did raise her siblings, and I think she feels some degree of responsibility towards them.\n\nThat is why I tried to step in because I am also nearing my breaking point. Only so much I can do, when I do come home I do handle taking my niece to her house, and I do help out for the last 3 hours of the day.", "Bet if OP split with her, and the wife was suddenly faced with having to find a job and go to work, she\u2019d find her boundaries PDQ.", "SIL called you an asshole? And why do you care being called an asshole by your SIL?", "Two things, one, you're doubling down on calling this slave labor. That makes you a huge asshole. Two, my sister in law runs an in-home daycare. I can guarantee she would watch our child if we asked. And yes, she wouldn't ask to be paid for it. I guess our families are just different.", "So she is not being manipulated. She is just too timid and weak to ask for money and set a boundary about continuing to do it.", "You need couples counseling.\n\nClearly this issue is spilling over into the relationship. Individual therapy is good, but your wife is establishing the boundaries and context for her therapy.  And that's how it should be. But this problem in your relationship needs someone to help the two of you work through things your wife isn't ready or doesn't want to face head on yet.", "Oh so she's now raising the next generation in addition to the last one. Your wife sounds like a wonderful giver, but I can emphasize with your position, wanting to help the one you love help herself.\n\nObviously you can't force her to stop if she's not willing to, even if she wants to.\n\nWhat does your breaking point look like? Like if this continues. Would you take on more of the childcare yourself or contribute financially to the SIL to get your wife off the hook? Would you be able to accept that this is a choice your wife needs to make for herself, and hang in the background to provide encouragement, advice, support while letting her take the lead even if the status quo simply continues? Would you leave over this?", ">That is why I tried to step in because I am also nearing my breaking point. Only so much I can do, \n\nYou've told your wife this? That you're about to snap? And what does that mean for you, that you're \"near your breaking point?\" For me that would mean I'm thinking of moving out. What does it mean for you, and does your wife know thos?", "I don't care about her my wife also called me one and did tell me I was overstepping. Maybe I am soft but that did sting being called an asshole by the person you love because you stood up for them.", "Did she have to provide the supplies for your child or did you provide it? Did you make her drop off your child to you after watching them for 12 hours, or did you pick up your child from her home? Unless you were taking advantage of the family that watched your kids, your situation isn\u2019t the same as OPs. I think that if the sister showed that she was grateful and did not take advantage of her sister, who she knows can be a doormat, his situation would be more similar to your arrangement.", "Yeah, I am doubling down by having a family watch your child for free for 12 hours a day, handling all expenses and supplies plus all meals. \n\nYou say that is normal childcare, I say it is bullshit and slave labor. \n\nI do not think a family should do childcare for free that is abusive. \n\nWhat about a family member whose chosen career was not child care, and they did not work would you be okay with them doing it for free especially when they have asked to be compensated but because they refuse to chase you down for money you forget to pay?\n\nThat is the situation I am talking about, if you are okay with not paying someone in that situation we have nothing else to say to one another. \n\nI do feel no reasonable person would be in favor of that.", "My wife does know I am at my breaking point but guess I am also a sucker cause I don't want to leave her to handle this alone even if it hurts."]}
