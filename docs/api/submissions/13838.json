You were trying to be tactful and helpful but she chose to misinterpret your words and chose to be offended. Her problem, not your's. NTA", "NTA. Somebody's mama is a drama mama.", "NAH - The zipper wasn't going up on them so it would be natural to wonder if they may be the wrong size. That isn't calling her fat - that's offering an explanation as to why the zip won't go up.", "NTA, imo she was taking her frustrations out on you. As a larger person myself I know the frustrations of not having something fit especially when it should (I mean the other pair fit and these are the same size so they should too, right....but no...) And so I think she was venting more than anything. It is easier to blame others than admit the truth to ourselves. \n\nAs a follow up question, when zipped up do they still look too tight?", "It\u2019s not like you brought in a bottle of baby oil to lube her up to maybe squeeze into the pants *that she herself couldn\u2019t fit into*. \n\nShe is deflecting her anger at herself being either too fat-or the pants too small a size-for her to get into. She is deflecting it into *you*.Sucks for her. This is not your fault. NTA", "NTA. You were criticizing the pants for being too small, not her for being too big. You said it the right way around and she chose to twist it.", "NTA\n\nAs you said, it's clear why your mom was a bit sensitive about this, but it wasn't wrong to merely suggest that the zipper might not work because the pants were not the right size.", "NAH:   Your comment was assholish, but your mother kinda rightfully got a little upset seeing that she's was right about the zipper", "You\u2019re not an AH you just commented on the sizing. Maybe don\u2019t do it again but you\u2019re not a bad person :)", "NTA \n\nI understand why someone would be offended. No worse feeling then throwing on a pair of jeans that always fit and suddenly don\u2019t. However, It is a perfectly understandable first thought as to why a pair wouldn\u2019t fit. \n\nGlad It was fixed, but mom should be able to understand where you\u2019re coming from.", "NAH you didn\u2019t say anything to hurt her on purpose but I think she might be insecure. You could say something like, \u201cthe sizes in this store run a little small try going up one.\u201d", "nta", "NTA Understand why mom might have got upset but you said the clothing might be too small, not her too big and that's an important distinction for me.", "nta, u didnt even mention her weight", "NTA - she's projecting.", "NTA\n\nI am \"normal\" sized (not overweight but definitely not skinny). If I try to put on a pair of size 0 jeans and they don't fit, it doesn't mean I'm fat, it means the pants are too small for me. Your mom has an issue with her weight, and apparently everyone else's, so she assumes everyone else sees her they way she sees herself. There is nothing you could have said besides agreeing with her that wouldn't have set her off", "Nta women's clothing sizes are so asinine and non standard that the same numerical size from one company to another is wildly different almost always. I've constantly had to go by what actually fits and but whatever arbitrary number it had. It very well could've been just too small.  Not her being too big, the pants...too small. Like, that shouldn't have been that hard to understand and she just lashed out.", "NTA Size varies depending on the manufacturer. Plus cotton shrinks over time. Skinny doesn't necessarily mean healthy either. I liked to eat, but I am active and try to eat ok. I don't worry about my weight or size. I worry about my energy level and if I can walk two miles without passing out. If you tell me I'm overweight, I am just going to shrug my shoulders and do me.", "NTA. Sometimes clothes are mis-sized.", "NTA - she has issues. I hope you have the confidence and support you need to be yourself even when she's bringing up her issues and blaming them on you.", "Next time say \u201cthese must be \u201cMade in China\u201d, they always claim they are bigger than they really are.

That's why she jumped down your throat.  That, my friend, is HER problem.   Most clothing is NOT exactly the same size across the board.   An 18 in one brand may be a 20 in another. You just stated that the pair she was trying on looked to be too small/ tight.  You s didn't call her fat or say anything about her weight."]}
