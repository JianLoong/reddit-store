Why would she not try for scholarships? Why not try to reduce what her parents would pay if they had the money? \n\nAt this point she has almost two years covered between her parents and uncle. She can start now and get the other two years worked on.", "If it's a selective school, there probably aren't many merit scholarships available, and those are often almost automatic, based on test scores and National Merit Scholar awards, etc., and typically offered with the acceptance. She will have filled out the FAFSA and the financial aid documents for her applications with the information her parents gave her-- they likely make too much money for her to receive need-based aid, they told her they would contribute the entire amount, and it is nearly impossible to be considered independent of your parents for financial aid purposes until you are 24. She wouldn't be eligible for most need-based aid from external scholarships, either, with the amount her parents make. \n\nAnd if her parents told her they would pay, of course she wouldn't take out loans.\n\nMost selective schools, which it sounds like Anna's school likely is, offer primarily need-based aid, and she wouldn't have qualified.", "NTA if they raised the topic in front of her.  \n\nBut it's all *really* weird.  Why is there any expectation that you would fund her education?  Had you agreed to and there is some kind of misunderstanding? It's a bizarre misunderstanding to arise.\n\n I don't know that parents necessarily owe their kids the cost of a college education - it's great if they can but the American education system is crazy expensive and I don't know that parenting extends to funding their children's adult lives.   \n\nBut what is *really\" unfair is to raise your kid's expectations about whether you would fund it if you had no intentions of doing it, or if you were expecting someone else to.

When those in-laws coming after you say something, simply point out that if Anna's parents didn't want her to know the truth then they shouldn't have asked the questions in front of her or where she could hear the answer. You may want to sit down with Anna seperately and start going over financial aid options and work options to give her a fighting chance. Either that or help her find another school that can be afforded that she will be happy with. With her parents upper middle class income, that may screw up her financial aid options, but there may also be some ways around that. I'm not sure because I myself never had to deal with that issue and don't know what is now available.", ">I was at their house for dinner when Virginia asked how much I had in my personal college fund for Anna since she knows I received a promotion recently. I explained that the promotion didn\u2019t include a raise in pay but that I still had about $40,000 saved for Anna. Shawn and Virginia both started to call me irresponsible because the annual cost of attendance at Anna\u2019s college (she received an early acceptance into her top-choice school) is over $30,000 and they were demanding to know why I didn\u2019t have more saved for Anna.\n\nThis is fucking galling.

They were banking on you to be their backup in this issue and didn't make any contingency plans.

OP must be wealthy to even be able to give a 40k gift, let alone be assumed to give a 120k gift of full tuition, but they still should've asked for clarification because no matter how wealthy someone is, an assumed $120k gift is a massive assumption you shouldn't rely on without quadruple confirmation.
