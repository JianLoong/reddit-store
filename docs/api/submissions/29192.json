I actually hate it. Going to a show sounds like torture.", "NTA.  He asked, you answered.  He got nasty.

I think it\u2019s kind of odd that he bought tickets without discussing with you. Especially if they were purchased before the first date (this sounds like your first date). More concerning is his reaction to you having a differing opinion - which you voiced perfectly politely, by the way. Is this guy going to feel entitled to get snippy rather than having a productive conversation (or just letting it go) every time a partner holds dissenting view?", "NTA. He handled it stupidly, to the point you\u2019re better off it didn\u2019t work out with him.", "NTA, not even slightly.

You owe him nothing. Not another date, not attending a concert you have no interest in. You\u2019re not compatible (and like others have pointed out, he sounds creepy controlling). He can deal with that like a big boy.", "Illinois and ky are not even that far away, wtf? There's not much of a difference culturally between southern IL and ky, I am so confused lol.\nAlso you dodged a bullet. Who buys concert tix without checking their date would enjoy it?", "NTA.

I would NEVER take a first date to a metal concert because I am a normal, thinking person who knows my tastes are the minority. Just like country.", "NTA. You answered honestly.

We all have our taste in music, those who don't respet others's are definitely red flags.\n\nSaying this as a musician who's also in the metal scene, we have lots of those...", "NTA and you're allowed to like or not like whatever music you want to. I'm sure someone in Kentucky also doesn't like country music. Sounds like he's never left his town or something.", "NTA. No one you have to hide your preferences around is worth dating. I like country but jazz and blue grass music are like nails on a chalkboard to me. It also strikes me as a red flag that before going on your first date he bought tickets to a whole country music festival for you guys. Who does that?", "NTA. Bullet dodged with that one. I used to enjoy country music before it morphed into just singing about your guns and truck and potential sexual assault. I won't listen to a genre that has turned women into playthings for the man with the biggest truck and a six pack of beer. \"Girl in a Country Song\" does an amazing parody video of that.", "NTA. Sounds like he\u2019s taking country a little too seriously! There are also plenty of people all over the country that listen to that genre, it\u2019s just that outside of Kentucky we apparently understand there\u2019s more than country out there. I grew up in the Bible Belt and I hate country music lol", "NTA\n\nSounds like you have an answer on whether or not to continue dating this person.  Obviously not...of course...getting that snippy about music?  Makes you wonder what else they will get needlessly snippy about.", "NTA. I'm pretty sure it's fair to expect people in Kentucky - and literally any other state - to be able to behave like reasonable people. The fact that he got concert tickets before asking if you liked that kind of music and then got butthurt about it is not excused by the region he's from.  You're allowed to like whatever you like and the way you responded wasn't even judgmental or rude at all.", "NTA. If he's that sensitive over your musical taste, he sounds exhausting.", "NTA.\n\nNo, you are not an asshole for expressing your opinion on things.\n\nWhy in the world you think you are? Are you asking if you were supposed to lie about what you like on dates in order to get the person to like you?\n\nNo, no you are not supposed to do that.", "NTA.  You're allowed to like and dislike things regardless of what some dude from Kentucky thinks.", "Why is this even a question here? NTA.", "What a dumb thing to get pissy about. You didn't even bash on it, and only explained cause he asked. You're allowed to not like certain music. Nta.", "Lol if he ever leaves Kentucky he will be in for a rude awakening.  NTA. He's TA for picking such a divisive genre of music to take a new date to.", "I have lived in Kentucky my whole life and have never had any qualms about telling people I don't like country. We have other music here too. Your friend is weird.\n\nNTA.", "NTA: It\u2019s always nice when the trash takes itself out.\n\n(9/11 ruined country music)", "NTA. Big red flags that he got mad at you for something you had no control over (him buying tickets). I would run.

He asked a question, you answered honestly and now he can\u2019t take the answer, that\u2019s not your fault/problem.", "NTA - and good job at getting rid of him early lol", "No", "NTA. He\u2019s being a weirdo.", "NTA, you have your personal preference and he bought tickets without knowing your preference which makes it a gamble for him.", "NTA.

Next!\n\nBut, really, having different tastes isn't an issue as long as everyone has space to enjoy whatever they like on their own. Throwing a fit because your tastes are different, however, is a big red flag.", "Nta . I can't stand country I can't quite put my finger on what I don't like either.  Anyways you're allowed to have a preference . I think part of his attitude was that he got tickets expecting you to like it and was bummed out when you didn't.  I get being bummed out on his part  but he acted childish about it  so he's mildly the asshole. He should of asked what kind of music , Hobbies , food etc you like before going out.  That probably would of made a better date . Also I disagree with what your friend said you shouldn't have to pretend to like something for anyone be yourself and if that makes you incompatible with that person then that just means that they weren't the right one for you .", "NTA.

The first few dates are supposed to be about finding out about each other and what you do & don't have in common.  If he can't be with someone who doesn't share his musical tastes,  that's fair enough but it is quite a red flag that he was a dick about it and a little worrying that he bought tickets without even knowing if there would be a second date. I think you dodged a bullet.\n\n\n(I am a fan of *some* country music and the broader genre of Americana and I've had some lighthearted \"arguments\" with people who hate on all country just because the current scene is largely lame.

I experienced something similar back in the early 90s when my roommate told our Black suite mate I didn\u2019t like Janet Jackson. Knowing my former roommate, I have reason to believe she implied I didn\u2019t like music by Black people, which is of course not true. \n\nSuite mate demanded to know why not, what\u2019s wrong with Janet Jackson? I said something like, \u201cnothing, I think she\u2019s very talented. But her music is not my style.\u201d That was it. I don\u2019t think Suite mate had Janet Jackson tickets though.", "NTA. He set you up. Maybe not on purpose, but the time to ask if you like country music is before shelling out for the tickets. \"Hey, OP, do you like country music? I can get us tickets to see X artist this weekend.\" Then you can say yes, or no, or that you're normally not into it but you do like X artist, or whatever.", "NTA. I totally agree with you", "I would have ended the date after the words \u201cCounty Music\u201d \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA I like country music, but it's not for everyone. Also it's sketchy that his reaction was to get so mad and offended, when it doesn't sound like you wouldn't have been up for trying it.
