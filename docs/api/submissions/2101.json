In this situation I do think your sister did the right thing. A suprise wedding guest is usually never a good idea since weddings in most cases includes seating arrangements, preparations of a certain number of meals etc. So I would tell your dad you know he's coming and that your happy about it but also make clear to him about your sister's habit of telling every secret and how she asks you to cover for her.\n\nCongratulation on your wedding!", "I'm confused. I want to say Y.T.A. if you tell your father that your sister spoiled his surprise, because his surprise sounds utterly awful to me, and your sister was right to protect you by telling you the truth. But you seem okay with his surprise?  I don't get it.  It seems cruel. But if you actually would have liked it, then yeah, you need to stop your sister from spoiling surprises all the time. You asked her to stop, and she won't. Then she manipulated you by telling you she has a secret, so that you'll ask, and then she can say it's your own fault and not hers. Is it me, or is there a gaslighting issue in this family?  Anyway, time to tell everybody else that she ruins all their surprises.  NTA.", "NTA. Weddings require a lot of planning and an unexpected guest can cause an unnecessary headache. I get it if it was a surprise for a small event but it\u2019s not appropriate for a wedding. Maybe that\u2019s a conversation to have with your dad, that surprises that could alter important, detailed, and/or expensive events are not always appropriate.\n\nOnto your sister, call her out! Every time she spoils a surprise, let whoever\u2019s surprise it was know. Tell people you don\u2019t want surprises shared with her. Tell her that if she\u2019s going to continue to ruin surprises for you that you\u2019ll be taking a step back (or whatever you feel is appropriate, I can\u2019t think of a good example at the moment haha). You need to establish firm boundaries and keep them. \n\nSomething I\u2019d also consider doing is right after she spoils a surprise ask her why she did that. Ask her what that accomplished. Ask her how sharing that surprise benefited you. Sometimes people don\u2019t question their own behaviour until it\u2019s really put under a spot light. \n\nCongrats on the wedding!!", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to protect her. Tell everyone that she can't keep a secret.", "NTA but without knowing the full history I would consider giving your sister some grace on this one because it sounds like your relationship with your father might not be that great and showing up to a wedding as a surprise is kind of tacky. I mean if anything your father should have let someone involved in the wedding know about the surprise like your fianc\u00e9 or your sister could have told your fianc\u00e9 while keeping it a surprise to you.\n\nEither way she seems to keep crossing your boundary. Whether you tell everyone about her past and current lies is up to you to decide if it\u2019s worth it. But maybe to prevent future instances, be firm with her that if she ruins any more surprises for you that you will not be keeping it a secret. Let her know that you do not feel protected by her actions. Everyone will know what she does as a consequence. If she continues, consider low contact/grey rock method of contact with her.", "I wanted him to be there. He told me he can\u2019t come because he has his covid vaccination that day. He is \u201edifficult\u201c because he doesn\u2019t care much about us. I got used to it. \n\nI was a little sad but it didn\u2019t truly surprise me that he couldn\u2019t come, so it was not a big deal for me.", "Give her a decoy secret so that when she realises she\u2019s been giving false information she will stop being the biggest set of loose lips this side side of Tom Holland.", "Thank you for your judgement. \n\nWe can\u2019t celebrate big because of covid. It\u2018s only a short civil ceremony and a champagne reception outside of the registry office. No seating arrangements or anything. :)", "Ah gotcha. YWNBTA then, and your sis really needs to stop spoiling things for you when you have told her not to. \n\nThat said, she might have actually done you a solid here. He's planning to show up as a surprise, so he's probably under the impression that his presence carries a lot more weight for you than it does. And if he plans to do some sort of grand reveal with the assumption that you will be over the moon about it, that could make for an awkward/upsetting scene at the wedding.", "INFO: Why does your father insist on committing to one thing and then 'surprising' you with another instead of just saying yes to begin with? That is manipulative behavior, and, while you're not asking for judgment on his behavior, I can see why your sister might want to protect you from stress on such a big event. Especially if your father can be difficult. \n\nYour sister is an AH for telling secrets but it smells like your father creates a stressful family dynamic from a need to surprise people by establishing low expectations instead of just doing his part as a member of your family.  Does he often like to make things that aren't about him about him? Does he like to take over things with a 'grand reveal'? Does he get upset when you don't receive his 'surprises' with the level of joy he expected?", "Do you know why your sister continues to spoil surprises for you? \nBecause YOU let her! Bu keeping her secrets and not exposing the truth. She gets the high of acrewing with you and the virtue of YOU going keeping her lies.\nY T A but only to yourself.\n\nEdited to separate verdict as I do not want it to count.", "NTA. Why are people still telling your sister secrets???", "YWNBTA if you told the family,  especially your father, that you know the surprise and how you found out.\n\nI do NOT understand how you knowing your father would actually be able to make it to your wedding or not be both somethingbso immensely vital AND something you need protection regarding. \n\nStop enabling your sister's crappy behavior, let her deal with the consequences of her actions. Oh, and her excuse of getting you to \"technically\" have her tell you the secret/surprise? Remember there's a difference between reasons and excuses, and you don't need excuses. Excuses are just a way to keep from taking responsibility.", "That\u2018s a great question and I need to think about it in more depth. But as far as I remember he never did anything like that before. \n\n\nHe being difficult usually means that he doesn\u2019t care for us at all. That\u2018s why I wasn\u2019t surprised he would ditch my wedding for a vaccination appointment that could be \u201edifficult to reschedule\u201c.", "I'm not sure about your sisters intentions but that seems like an AH move by your dad.\n\nWhat's his intention behind giving a lame excuse except the part when you feel bad? Is it really to give you a rush of endorphins when he actually attends, is it to get a bunch of attention that he might not otherwise get, is it to cause drama?", "Ok, then a surprise could work. Tell your dad about your sister!", "Thank you for considering this. Just decide whether your relationship with your sister is worth 'coming clean' to your father. Perhaps talk to her about her need to blab secrets and stress to her that this behavior will erode any trust you and others have in her. This seems like a small thing but usually this type of behavior (her blabbing and his grandstanding) are symptoms of something bigger than Reddit's paygrade.", "Because to him, it was actually a valid reason. From what I gathered from my sister, he apparently said, appointments at his doctor\u2018s office are hard to get. Thankfully he managed to reschedule. In his head, his vaccination is just more important than me. \n\nHe is like that. Missed his aunts\u2018 funeral because he planned to arrive a day later and just because the aunt died, he can\u2019t be expected to reschedule\u2026 \n\nI know not to expect much from my family anymore. It doesn\u2019t hurt me like it used to.", "Ah ok. I'm sorry for that.\n\nA petty part of me wouldn't say a thing and then be very normal with him when he shows up. Like it's no big deal if he's there or not. If he thought it wasn't important enough to skip a vaccination then why would he expect a big reaction by surprising you?\n\nEdit: it's sort of a win/win because if he does say anything then you can just say 'oh, sister spoiled the surprise ages ago. You know you can't tell her these things'.", "People don\u2019t stop their behaviour if they\u2019re not suffering the consequences of it. Stop lying for her. If she ruins a surprise tell everyone. Maybe then people will stop letting her in on the secret knowing it won\u2019t be kept from you. But be careful what you wish for. If she is genuinely trying to protect you, you\u2019ll lose that too.", "NTA - even if you asked - if she were told to keep a secret she has to keep a secret. That\u2018s not on you. And she will be seen as the bad guy because she is the bad guy. Is she jealous?", "NTA but tell everyone. She should be the bad guy here. This is very deliberate. And uninvite the sister. She quite clearly doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart.", "NTA, but weigh the effect of outing her duplicity in advance.  Your difficult father wants this to be about him (which is wrong but this is who he is).  If you disclose in advance, he may just refuse to show up.", "In all honesty, you know this already, but your sister is a massive, selfish jackwagon. She doesn't want to be seen as the bad guy BECAUSE SHE IS THE BAD GUY.\n\nTell your parents to stop confusing surprises for you in her because she leaks like a defective faucet. You're NTA.", "Why is everyone asking like the sister did a bad thing? If I were OP, I would be very upset that my own father wasn\u2019t attending my wedding. Her father\u2018s decision to lie about that was cruel. The only bad thing that the sister is doing is lying now to the father. She should have said, \u201cThat\u2019s cruel and I won\u2019t be a part of it. You have until the end of the day to tell the truth, or I am telling OP myself.\u201c", "Happy cake day!", "Thank you! I will definitely consider that before doing anything rush. You all give me a lot of ideas and insight and your last sentence was very important.", "I hate surprises, but OP clearly likes them. People are responding to the sister as OP led them to. She\u2019s told her sister on multiple occasions she likes surprises. Her sister is deliberately being cruel. It\u2019s not about what, it\u2019s that she knows it bothers OP and keeps doing it", "This! It seems like your sister was wanting to protect you from your father\u2019s bs, not ruin a surprise. Why would he think this is a good idea? Why is a vaccine that can easily be rescheduled at a health department more important than your wedding? Your father sounds like an AH.", "I think you\u2019re projecting on to your sister here. \n\nYour dad is deliberately causing you stress on your wedding day. Your sister is trying to ease that stress. \n\nWould it have truly been a nice surprise to wake up thinking that your dad didn\u2019t care about you enough to show up to your wedding, then have him show up? \n\nOP, this is not a nice surprise from your dad. He\u2019s not a nice person. Your sister is trying to be there for you."]}
