In this situation I do think your sister did the right thing. A suprise wedding guest is usually never a good idea since weddings in most cases includes seating arrangements, preparations of a certain number of meals etc. So I would tell your dad you know he's coming and that your happy about it but also make clear to him about your sister's habit of telling every secret and how she asks you to cover for her.\n\nCongratulation on your wedding!", "I'm confused. I want to say Y.T.A. if you tell your father that your sister spoiled his surprise, because his surprise sounds utterly awful to me, and your sister was right to protect you by telling you the truth. But you seem okay with his surprise?  I don't get it.  It seems cruel. But if you actually would have liked it, then yeah, you need to stop your sister from spoiling surprises all the time. You asked her to stop, and she won't. Then she manipulated you by telling you she has a secret, so that you'll ask, and then she can say it's your own fault and not hers.

Weddings require a lot of planning and an unexpected guest can cause an unnecessary headache. I get it if it was a surprise for a small event but it\u2019s not appropriate for a wedding. Maybe that\u2019s a conversation to have with your dad, that surprises that could alter important, detailed, and/or expensive events are not always appropriate.\n\nOnto your sister, call her out! Every time she spoils a surprise, let whoever\u2019s surprise it was know. Tell people you don\u2019t want surprises shared with her. Tell her that if she\u2019s going to continue to ruin surprises for you that you\u2019ll be taking a step back (or whatever you feel is appropriate, I can\u2019t think of a good example at the moment haha). You need to establish firm boundaries and keep them. \n\nSomething I\u2019d also consider doing is right after she spoils a surprise ask her why she did that. Ask her what that accomplished. Ask her how sharing that surprise benefited you. Sometimes people don\u2019t question their own behaviour until it\u2019s really put under a spot light. \n\nCongrats on the wedding!!", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to protect her. Tell everyone that she can't keep a secret.", "NTA but without knowing the full history I would consider giving your sister some grace on this one because it sounds like your relationship with your father might not be that great and showing up to a wedding as a surprise is kind of tacky. I mean if anything your father should have let someone involved in the wedding know about the surprise like your fianc\u00e9 or your sister could have told your fianc\u00e9 while keeping it a surprise to you.\n\nEither way she seems to keep crossing your boundary. Whether you tell everyone about her past and current lies is up to you to decide if it\u2019s worth it. But maybe to prevent future instances, be firm with her that if she ruins any more surprises for you that you will not be keeping it a secret. Let her know that you do not feel protected by her actions. Everyone will know what she does as a consequence.

YWNBTA then, and your sis really needs to stop spoiling things for you when you have told her not to. \n\nThat said, she might have actually done you a solid here. He's planning to show up as a surprise, so he's probably under the impression that his presence carries a lot more weight for you than it does.

That is manipulative behavior, and, while you're not asking for judgment on his behavior, I can see why your sister might want to protect you from stress on such a big event. Especially if your father can be difficult. \n\nYour sister is an AH for telling secrets but it smells like your father creates a stressful family dynamic from a need to surprise people by establishing low expectations instead of just doing his part as a member of your family.

Is it really to give you a rush of endorphins when he actually attends, is it to get a bunch of attention that he might not otherwise get, is it to cause drama?", "Ok, then a surprise could work. Tell your dad about your sister!", "Thank you for considering this. Just decide whether your relationship with your sister is worth 'coming clean' to your father. Perhaps talk to her about her need to blab secrets and stress to her that this behavior will erode any trust you and others have in her. This seems like a small thing but usually this type of behavior (her blabbing and his grandstanding) are symptoms of something bigger than Reddit's paygrade.", "Because to him, it was actually a valid reason. From what I gathered from my sister, he apparently said, appointments at his doctor\u2018s office are hard to get. Thankfully he managed to reschedule. In his head, his vaccination is just more important than me. \n\nHe is like that. Missed his aunts\u2018 funeral because he planned to arrive a day later and just because the aunt died, he can\u2019t be expected to reschedule\u2026 \n\nI know not to expect much from my family anymore. It doesn\u2019t hurt me like it used to.", "Ah ok. I'm sorry for that.\n\nA petty part of me wouldn't say a thing and then be very normal with him when he shows up. Like it's no big deal if he's there or not. If he thought it wasn't important enough to skip a vaccination then why would he expect a big reaction by surprising you?\n\nEdit: it's sort of a win/win because if he does say anything then you can just say 'oh, sister spoiled the surprise ages ago. You know you can't tell her these things'.", "People don\u2019t stop their behaviour if they\u2019re not suffering the consequences of it. Stop lying for her. If she ruins a surprise tell everyone.

OP, if you don't think that is the case why are you hesitating to tell people that your sister can never keep a secret? What to you think will happen if people find out that she has blabbed? The whole issue of secrets seems to have  become very fraught in your family and I think that is down to your father.", "NTA It\u2019s really surprising to me that people here are angry at your sister and not your dad for coming up with this idiotic \u201csurprise\u201d.

Thus, surprises are potentially deadly? /s\n\nBy all means please, PLEASE tell everyone why you already know dad is coming, especially dad. Then, tell them how she\u2019s ruined every surprise she\u2019s ever known about over the years. Tell them they can\u2019t tell her *anything*; it\u2019s GOOD if she\u2019s \u201cseen as the bad guy\u201d, because she definitely is, has been, and doubtlessly will continue to be.

Also, in the process she manipulates you and forces you to lie as well, something you have told her you do not want to do. She has ignored your repeated requests to stop; time to take the gloves off and just tell everybody everything. What if you have kids someday and she starts doing it to them? Got some big Christmas or birthday present you can\u2019t wait to see their little faces when they see what it is, but then they come running to you all excited about it because sis spilled the beans? Some people just enjoy sharing secrets in spite of being asked begged or threatened not to, but your sister seems to enjoy weaponizing them in some twisted way, so they need to just be taken out of her hands completely and if that process is unpleasant for her, don\u2019t you worry about it. At all. \n\nOn a separate note, congratulations on your upcoming nuptials \u2013 wishing you both all the love in the world!", "I'd lose my mind if my dad said he wasn't attending my wedding (lied) just to surprise me. The dad is the AH here.", "She doesn\u2019t want you to tell cause she\u2019ll look like the \u201cbad guy \u201c when she is, indeed, the bad guy. If you rat her out in the future , I would imagine she would either stop telling you or others would stop telling her. Problem solved,right?", "This can't be real\n\n>she\u2018ll be seen as the bad guy then\nShe is the bad guy\n\n>Which is technically absolutely correct. \nNo it isn't, that information was not vital.\n\n\nIf it is real you need to grow a spine and stand up for yourself or continue being a doormat but obviously your sister is an AH but your not doing anything about it.", "She'll be seen as the bad guy because she is the bad guy. Tell him. NTA", "NTA. Tell everyone. Hopefully then they'll realise she shouldn't be trusted with information.", "I don\u2019t want to hurt her by ratting her out. She always tells me that I am the only person she can truly trust because she has noone else. \n\n\nI haven\u2019t seen my father in two years and we talk maybe once a month. Also my sister ruins surprises from my friends and my extended family, too, so I am not too sure about your idea. But thank you for your judgement!", "Omg not Tom Holland \ud83d\ude02 even he isn't this bad", "I think that\u2019s an early Big Bang Theory, Sheldon and Amy experimenting with what kind of gossip spreads faster in the group.", "You need to tell your husband. She isn\u2019t \u201cprotecting you\u201d from a bracelet, she is taking away some of the joy from both you and the person trying to surprise you. You should at least stop that between you and your husband so that she can\u2019t get between you and so that he knows not to trust her.", "NTA. You would be if this was a first offensive, but she's done it over and over again and you've asked her not to. And by telling you she \"can't tell you something but you need to know\" she's manipulated you into \"giving her permission\" to tell you. \n\nTell people she ruined the surprise if it comes up, but don't go out of your way to do it. Perhaps she'll finally learn then. And if in the future she pulls the \"I can't say but you need to know\" trick you know to just stick your fingers in your ears and walk away", "NTA - your sister sure is the AH for being so devious and willing to ruin surprises.", "Nta but I would just tell everyone and stop protecting your sister if you've asked her not to do this and she continues to do it", "Your dad is TA but so is your sister if she is constantly running surprises. If you were someone who hates surprises it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal but since you like surprises she is just being an a-hole.", "Obviously YTA for letting your sister get away with this behavior for so long. Tell everyone what she's done -- particularly your Dad -- then cut her off. Why have such an abusive person in your life when you don't have to?", "NTA. Tell everyone to stop asking your sister to keep secrets, because she tells you immediately. Take away her ability to ruin things for you. It's a shitty combination of wanting to ruin your fun, and wanting to have power. Tell her It's mean and you want her to stop, and tell everyone she does it. STOP KEEP SECRETS FOR SOMEONE WHO WON'T KEEP SECRETS FOR OTHERS.", "If your sister was trying to protect you she wouldn't have manipulated you into asking her about it. She would have talked to you like an adult. What is there about a bracelet, parties, or surprise visits that you need \"protecting\" from? Nothing. Your sister is a manipulative liar who enjoys hurting you then guilting you into not telling anyone so she can continue to hurt you. It's a game of power to her, and as long as you're silent, she wins.", "And it's not like we have the context to know that the father was originally lying about having to miss it. Maybe he really *was* going to have to miss out, but managed to pull some strings so he could attend and, knowing OP likes surprises, intended to make him being able to go a pleasant surprise for her.", "Unless he \"canceled\"  last minute- after all the catering and such is set- at least one of the soon to be newly weds needs to know he's coming so they can handle logistics.\n\nWhat is he going to eat, where is he going to sit, will they be having a father daughter dance, what music will they dance to if they do, ect.", "OP said as an edit on the end of their post that they're having a very simple courthouse wedding and small, informal reception afterwards. So that's literally not a problem here. Sis just spoiled it to be a spoilsport.", "Can you give examples of what suprises she's ruined in the past?  Because I have to agree with the above poster, she did you a solid here and your father is an asshole.  The fact that you're used to it makes me wonder if you're surrounded by assholes and just don't realize it.", "I think that\u2019s a fair point- I saw your examples in a post below. I think those are pretty crappy things to spoil. Definitely talk with her about those. I understand why this one is upsetting to you with those as a background, but I think  she\u2019s doing you a solid this time. But absolutely talk to her about those other ones.", "Surprise visits from friends, gifts from my soon-to-be-husband, christmas and birthday gifts. \n\n\nThink of \u201eI just MUST tell you so you don\u2019t get overwhelmed, he got you a bracelet with your name on it!\u201c \u201eSo to make sure that you don\u2019t buy it twice, I just HAVE to tell you that you will get XY!\u201c \u201eDon\u2019t tell her that I\u2018ve told you, but your friend is trying to do something nice for you, so she\u2018ll invite you go to a movie! But I promised not to tell, so you can\u2019t tell them that I told you!\u201c", "Yeah no, those sound like her being shitty.  Why do people keep telling her things?"]}
