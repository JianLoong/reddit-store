She approached me to ask for help, and I was only glad to help her.\n\nI told her that she can live in my house rent-free, and that she can stay there as long as she wants. Also, that I have no problem even if she lives there permanently, etc. My wife Sarah (35 F) was fine with it as well.\n\nShe likes to walk around in 'revealing' clothes. Sometimes she doesn't wear a bra, and at others she has no top at all.\n\nI had no problem with remaining there at all, but I don't like people who act like this. Especially when it's my house. I never asked her to not wear such stuff if she's staying elsewhere. So I asked her politely to not do that, especially since there's my 10 year old son as well.\n\nShe got mad and accused me of \"controlling\" her, being a misogynist, and that it's none of my business what she wears, etc. I responded by saying \"It is my business when you're living in my house. If you want to do that, go ahead, but you cannot do it here. My morals do not allow that, and you're not even paying anything. I told you that you can live here for ever, and the least thing you can do to  repay it is to wear decent clothes.\"\n\nShe got mad a lot and began to yell at me, using abusive language, etc. I did not back down & asked her to get out if she thinks it's problematic. She said \"When I can live here without paying money? Fuck that, I am not going to leave and I don't want to search for another house either.\"\n\nSo she's still here. But I am wondering whether it was an overreach on my part considering what I told her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701879212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c7ewd/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_not_walk_around/", "score": 3429, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

Obviously, you care about your sister, as you have offered her a home for the rest of her life. If she leaves, where is she going to go? Do you care?

Her unwillingness to change her behavior and her unwillingness to leave seem to indicate she has zero desire to adjust her behavior to fit in with society. This would be fine if she was able to maintain her financial independence, but she's not.\n\nShe's never going to learn that if you enable her behavior by allowing it.

Otherwise you're going to end up with a naked drug addict on your couch for your kid's tween years. That's not a great idea. She'll also never get the tools to dig herself out of this hole if you're running older brother's house for unconditional boarding of drug addicts.\n\nAlso, for the love of god look up tenancy laws in your state because it's entirely possible that she could establish herself as a \"rent free tenant\" and then you'd have to formally evict her to get her to leave.
