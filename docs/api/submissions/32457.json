She approached me to ask for help, and I was only glad to help her.\n\nI told her that she can live in my house rent-free, and that she can stay there as long as she wants. Also, that I have no problem even if she lives there permanently, etc. My wife Sarah (35 F) was fine with it as well.\n\nShe likes to walk around in 'revealing' clothes. Sometimes she doesn't wear a bra, and at others she has no top at all.\n\nI had no problem with remaining there at all, but I don't like people who act like this. Especially when it's my house. I never asked her to not wear such stuff if she's staying elsewhere. So I asked her politely to not do that, especially since there's my 10 year old son as well.\n\nShe got mad and accused me of \"controlling\" her, being a misogynist, and that it's none of my business what she wears, etc. I responded by saying \"It is my business when you're living in my house. If you want to do that, go ahead, but you cannot do it here. My morals do not allow that, and you're not even paying anything. I told you that you can live here for ever, and the least thing you can do to  repay it is to wear decent clothes.\"\n\nShe got mad a lot and began to yell at me, using abusive language, etc. I did not back down & asked her to get out if she thinks it's problematic. She said \"When I can live here without paying money? Fuck that, I am not going to leave and I don't want to search for another house either.\"\n\nSo she's still here. But I am wondering whether it was an overreach on my part considering what I told her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701879212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c7ewd/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_not_walk_around/", "score": 757, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

Obviously, you care about your sister, as you have offered her a home for the rest of her life. If she leaves, where is she going to go? Do you care?

Her unwillingness to change her behavior and her unwillingness to leave seem to indicate she has zero desire to adjust her behavior to fit in with society. This would be fine if she was able to maintain her financial independence, but she's not.\n\nShe's never going to learn that if you enable her behavior by allowing it.

Otherwise you're going to end up with a naked drug addict on your couch for your kid's tween years. That's not a great idea. She'll also never get the tools to dig herself out of this hole if you're running older brother's house for unconditional boarding of drug addicts.\n\nAlso, for the love of god look up tenancy laws in your state because it's entirely possible that she could establish herself as a \"rent free tenant\" and then you'd have to formally evict her to get her to leave.

Would you accept that you'd be an asshole if you asked someone to wear a top while in your home?", "i'd say running around with your tits out is also encroaching on other peoples lives if they haven't asked for it.", "In my state, a homeowner has the right to remove a guest that has overstayed their welcome. So yes, I have the right to absolutely control if a guest gets to stay in my house for basically any reason. I don't believe the clothing you wear is a protected class, and even then I am not sure if protected classes apply here. \n\nI don't believe you have a right to stay in my house without my permission.", "That is kind of the point of owing your own property. You get to be the dictator as long as you are following the law.", "And I disagree. I don't think it is unreasonable to be comfortable in your own home and this is a minor request to achieve that goal. \n\nI don't even agree with the rule or would set it in my home, but I also don't think it is that ridiculous of a request.", "If you had a non-paying guest that regularly walked around clotheless with his dick out around your child daughter, would you change your mind? \n\nHeck, I think even a paying guest doing that probably wouldn't last long", "...you honestly think not wanting your guests to walk around with no bra and no top, breasts completely exposed, is 'insanity?'\n\nBecause that's what we're talking here.  Not 'no bra, but wearing a sweater' or even 'no bra, but wearing a camisole' but 'nude from the waist up.'", "Are you okay with any of your guests walking around your house completely nude? I am, so by your logic, you must be too and you have no right to dictate if you have guest come out of the bathroom completely nude.", "Honestly no problem with nipples, but I wouldn't be walking clotheless around children either. \n\nI just try to respect the wishes of whoevers house I'm in and try to be a polite guest. Especially if I'm not paying.", "Okay. So what is morally incorrect about setting a reasonable rule to remain comfortable within his own home? \n\nHe could kick out on the streets. That seems a bit worse than asking her to cover up.", "He is morally correct to set whatever rules he wants", "If she did that anywhere else it could legitimately tried as a sex crime depending where they live, whether you like it or not boobs are seen as sexual organs by the majority of people and it's not cool to be exposing any small child to that let alone family. I mean no rational person wants to see their family members private areas.", "Slowly : \n\nthere is a difference between having no underwear underneath clothes and having no underwear underneath no clothes. \n\nI wouldn't require a guest to have specific underwear under their clothes. I would require that they remain fully clothed. \n\nSo, when OP says : \n\n> Sometimes she doesn't wear a bra, and at others she has no top at all.\n\nI see that the first situation (no bra) as non problematic, but the second (no bra, no top) as problematic. \n\nIn your example, if a non-paying guest wears pants in my house and no briefs or boxers, who am I to tell them to wear underpants? If they are walking around in my house with no pants and no underpants, that's a different matter.\n\nDifferent matters are perceived differently.\n\nCovered uncontained titties are fine. \n\nUncovered uncontained titties are not fine.\n\nIs it clearer?", "Not wearing a bra and having your dick out are two entirely different things.\n\nOP has every right to tell his sister not to walk around without a top on. But expecting women to wear a bra at all times IS misogynistic, unnecessary and inappropriate.", "sorry, that made no sense. \n\nIf you can't see the difference between \"having nude/topless guests at home\" and \"having clothed guests that don't wear underwear\", I can't help you.", "If a rule was, \"anyone who lives in my house has to worship me as a god, pray to me every night, and write one paragraph a day about how great i am\" Thats not morally correct at all.", "Nah, he's within his rights. Morally correct is more case by case.", "That makes too much sense, you can't say that on degen reddit", "What right do you have to dictate the ground rules people set in their own homes? Your argument is fine if this were a roommate or someone paying rent, but your home is your safe space and castle, and if something or someone that has no right to the property is making you uncomfortable, you have every right to ask them to leave or change.", "It doesn't matter if they are completely different things. The point is, whoever's home it is has the right to set reasonable rules for their guests, and if someone is uncomfortable with a topless guest, it is well within their right to ask them to put a shirt on or leave. The original comment implied that because they were comfortable with boxers or briefs in their home, that everyone else should be too. Everyone's line of comfortability is different, and whoever's home that is gets to dictate those parameters.\n\nDon't like it, leave.\n\nEdit: I also agree with you that asking someone to wear a bra could be misogynistic. However, I would also say that someone still has the right to make that request in their own home."]}
