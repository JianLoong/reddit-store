The problem I've been having with my boyfriend is that he doesn't like when I hang out with my best friend. (26M). \n\nMy best friend and I have been friends since kindergarten, but ever since I started dating my boyfriend, he hasn't been wanting me to hang out with him. So, following his wishes, I sent a text to my BFF telling him what's going on and stayed away for a few weeks. So yesterday, It was about one in the afternoon and I was watching TV with my boyfriend in the living room of my house, when I heard music blasting outside. I go to the window, and my best friend is holding up a speaker doing those cheesy romance type things. (And yes, that's how our friendship is. We act cheesy towards each other most of the time because we love each other -Also, he's gay which I told my boyfriend and that were strictly platonic). I open the window and ask him what's going on. He puts the speaker down and pauses the music and says:\n\n\"I miss you, and I miss hanging out with you. I know it's not my place but I really don't like your boyfriend. You should be able to come out whenever and be with whoever, and since he won't let you do that, I've come to rescue you. If you want to leave and come to my place to chill, or go out to eat and go shopping, you're welcome to. I'll be waiting.\"\n\nI turn around, and my boyfriend is standing behind me. He told me that if I leave, we're over because he doesn't actually think my best friend is gay and that it's probably a lie so that I could cheat on him or something. I told him, reminding him that he IS gay and that he has been since we were both 14. He still didn't budge. I told him that it's fine and that we were over, because he's been nothing but controlling over me since we started dating. He then stops me before I grab my coat and says that he thought we were serious and that he was thinking about marrying me. I told him that we've only been dating for two months lmao \ud83d\udc80 but I told him to leave and to not bother returning. \n\nI left with my best friend and we had an awesome day. When I got home last night though, I turned on my phone to see that I had all sorts of  voice messages and calls from my boyfriend and a few other ?? Phone numbers. I listened to them and as it turns out he told his parents and family about what happened and he had them contact me. \n\nIs he just hysterical, or am I in the wrong??
