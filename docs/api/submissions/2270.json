{"id": 2270, "submission_id": "yukjrp", "title": "AITA for choosing my Guy best friend over my boyfriend??", "selftext": "Okay. So I (24F) got a boyfriend (27M) a few months ago. The problem I've been having with my boyfriend is that he doesn't like when I hang out with my best friend. (26M). \n\nMy best friend and I have been friends since kindergarten, but ever since I started dating my boyfriend, he hasn't been wanting me to hang out with him. So, following his wishes, I sent a text to my BFF telling him what's going on and stayed away for a few weeks. So yesterday, It was about one in the afternoon and I was watching TV with my boyfriend in the living room of my house, when I heard music blasting outside. I go to the window, and my best friend is holding up a speaker doing those cheesy romance type things. (And yes, that's how our friendship is. We act cheesy towards each other most of the time because we love each other -Also, he's gay which I told my boyfriend and that were strictly platonic). I open the window and ask him what's going on. He puts the speaker down and pauses the music and says:\n\n\"I miss you, and I miss hanging out with you. I know it's not my place but I really don't like your boyfriend. You should be able to come out whenever and be with whoever, and since he won't let you do that, I've come to rescue you. If you want to leave and come to my place to chill, or go out to eat and go shopping, you're welcome to. I'll be waiting.\"\n\nI turn around, and my boyfriend is standing behind me. He told me that if I leave, we're over because he doesn't actually think my best friend is gay and that it's probably a lie so that I could cheat on him or something. I told him, reminding him that he IS gay and that he has been since we were both 14. He still didn't budge. I told him that it's fine and that we were over, because he's been nothing but controlling over me since we started dating. He then stops me before I grab my coat and says that he thought we were serious and that he was thinking about marrying me. I told him that we've only been dating for two months lmao \ud83d\udc80 but I told him to leave and to not bother returning. \n\nI left with my best friend and we had an awesome day. When I got home last night though, I turned on my phone to see that I had all sorts of  voice messages and calls from my boyfriend and a few other ?? Phone numbers. I listened to them and as it turns out he told his parents and family about what happened and he had them contact me. \n\nIs he just hysterical, or am I in the wrong??

If it starts with that, it ends with him controlling everything you do.", "NTA. He\u2019s very controlling - sending family after you is a pathetic move from an adult man - and his reasoning for isolating you from your best friend makes no sense.

Definitely the right choice! That boy was bad news, & your bff could see it more clearly than you.", "I can see both sides, but him accusing of being with the other dude and talking about marriage after only 2 months at 25ish is unsettling. I originally thought your friend over stepped BUT maybe he saw some things you didnt and saved you.... so    NTA", "If it were already a more serious, committed relationship AND there were other flags telling this bf he shouldn't trust you, I would be on his side here.  But if he is already this insecure and controlling after a couple months of dating, you were wise to end it.", " NTA-You dodged a nuclear missile  not a bullet by breaking up with your boyfriend. \n\nSomeone who genuinely cares about you would never try to keep yon away from your friends.", "NTA - your bf is a walking red flag complete with super loud alarm bells, your best friend sounds awesome. Stick with your best friend and stay away from bf/ex-bf, you deserve someone that respects your Friends and freedom.", "NTA you need to get away from him and his family. That is crazy controlling behavior.", "NTA. Best friend sounds like a blast to be around, and your (ex) bf sounds like the exact opposite. Even disregarding the \"I don't believe he's actually gay and you're cheating on me with him\" thing (which is a whole 'nother can of worms), people are allowed to have lives and friends outside of their s/o and you don't get to control who your partner does or doesn't hang out with just because you don't like them.", "NTA \n\nGay or nor you are allowed to have relationships outside of the one with your boyfriend. Ditch him and hang out with your bestie.\n\nAlso, boyfriend doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s gay? That\u2019s just silly.", "NTA. Your ex seems like he was a codependent mess. The \u201chim or me\u201d ultimatum was a gateway to him alienating you from anyone else in your life he didn\u2019t approve of, and the fact that he had a bunch of random people calling you is just absurd. You definitely made the right choice.", "NTA you dodged a bullet\n\nAlso talking about marriage after 2 months?", "NTA. I just listed to a true life podcast about a girl who was murdered by a boyfriend like that. Good for you! Real men don't need to control and isolate you. His jealousy issues are his own. What a baby for telling his mommy on you. You dodged a HUGE mess! Your friend sounds amazing, stick with him. Any future boyfriend should want to be friends with your friend, and be happy for you to have such a good friend.", "NTA!!! You dodged a bullet. I had a relationship like this in high school and it was awful!!!", "NTA, you are right about this.  Your boyfriend was controlling and manipulative and it would just get worse with him.  You did the right thing by breaking it off as I think you have avoided a lot of heartache.  You deserve better.  \n\nGlad you enjoyed the time with your friend!", "NTA\u2026. What a psycho\u2026 change your number ASAP", "Yooooo he is hysterical. What a nightmare boyfriend!\n\nNTA at all", "NTA - I\u2019m so glad that your Best Friend saved you from that relationship. Your ex sounds unhinged, stay very far away. The amount of red flags were staggering.", "NTA. If this guy can't handle you having a friend who you have known since childhood and he is only with you for two months, it will only get worse. \nPlus his insecurities when you have told him BFF is gay means he will forever be suspicious of any male you spend any time with, including people you work with. \nYou are better off with BFF and another SO will come along who isn't threatened by your friends.", "NTA dodged a red bullet", "YBTA. He way over reacted and putting anyone not immediately related to you above your significant other makes them just an \u201cother\u201d not significant at all.", "NTA your bf went overboard with his reaction. But he\u2019s probably right about your \u201cgay\u201d best friend", "ESH, mainly your ex of course, for obvious reasons. However I think most guys would be uncomfortable with their girlfriend doing \"cheesy romance things\" with their friend. Even if it is a joke or whatever it does show a certain lack of respect for your relationship with your boyfriend. In the future I think you and your friend should hold off a bit in these displays. Or don't and probably cause more issues with your next boyfriend.", "\u201cI really don\u2019t like your boyfriend\u201d makes me say ESH, he is a friend who does provide a negative impression of your relationship. \n\nYour boyfriend is a but controlling but that\u2019s all about the boundaries you two are willing to set and accept, and if the boundaries are not liked there is no reason to be in the relationship at all.", "Ex has more than a few problems to work through; he\u2019s a walking, talking red flag of escalating abusive behavior. \n\n1. Separating OP from her support system \n\n2. Accusing OP of wanting to cheat\n\n3. Trying to stop OP from leaving\n\n4. Quick and intense involvement (randomly bringing up marriage when he didn\u2019t get his way)\n\n5. The desperate attempt when OP ends the relationship\n\nOP, Good for you for leaving this guy early. It\u2019s doubtful his behavior would improve but would only get worse.", "Nooo. Break up already, don't fck that guy anymore.\n\nNta", "NTA. And thank your friend a lot.", "I think the bf's previous controlling behavior earned him the lack of respect."]}
