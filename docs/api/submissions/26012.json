I (16F) recently participated in a summer exchange program and went to abroad to a foreign country to study for the semester. Over there, I had a great time, was on good terms with my host family and friends, except one girl.\n\nThis girl had a different body type to me, she was slightly bigger. (I don't mean this in a rude way, she just was,). I do a lot of extracurriculars that require exercise so I stay in shape. The entire program, I had a feeling she hated me.\n\nAnything I said, whatever I did, she always found a way to say: \"Yeah it's because you're so skinny.\" and even went as far to call me \"anorexic\" when I told her I was on a diet. (This is a healthy diet recommended to me by medical professionals).\n\nIt kinda made me uncomfortable. Once, I suggested going swimming and she said, \"Of course you'd want to go swimming, you're the tiniest person here, you can show yourself in a swimsuit.\" Like, jeez.\n\nThere was one phrase she used, A LOT. \"You need to eat more.\" I have a small appetite, and I eat less than her, it's not that big of a deal girl...\n\nBy the last day, I had had it. It was my last day, I was so sad, I didn't want to leave my friends, and I wasn't feeling hungry. It was around the 50th time she told me, \"Girl, you need to eat more. I can like see your bones sticking out.\" and I freaked out.\n\nI was having a bad day. The last thing I needed was to deal with her, so I responded, \"Yeah? You need to eat less you fat f\\*ck.\"\n\nShe was shocked, and I left before a response. She texted me later and said she was shocked how fatphobic I was being and she's glad I left. She even got her parents to text and call me to yell at me.\n\nI am feeling bad, AITA reddit?", "created_utc": 1693582970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167am9g/aita_for_telling_a_girl_you_need_to_eat_less/", "score": 531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she doesn't want to hear commemts about her weight, she should not have commented yours all the time.", "NTA. Its pretty much justified. I do not condone fatphobia or body shaming in general. Seeing the title made me think that you were the A hole. Her saying that already had changed me whole perspective on this situation. Anorexia is a serious condition and should not be made fun of. She honestly needs to grow the f**k up. If she can't handle bodyshaming then why does she do it? Shes a degenerate.", "NTA \n\nShe shamed you (out of jealousy) 50 times and you responded in kind. Totally deserved!", "NTA she started it", "NTA. She started this by provoking you throughout the whole trip. And body-shaming goes both ways. It\u2019s not okay for someone to make fun of a person for being smaller.", "NTA. She was bodyshaming you. If ahe can't see that, not ur problem", "NTA. Your response was funny.", "INFO: Did you say anything to her about her comments prior to this?", "ESH. She sucks, but so does your reaction. You handled the situation poorly.", "NTA. She made fun of your body and  made DISGUSTING comment on your appearence. Your answer was pretty tamed compare to what the most of us would have said in your place. The one saying otherwise must be like the other girl and openly bodyshamed skinnier people, wish is  terrible.", "NTA in future leave the host family if you have problems", "Did you talk about it with her earlier? Like that you dont like what she is saying you?", "ESH\n\nShe for obvious reasons. You for your OTT reaction by swearing at her. You shouldn't have kept it all pent up until you burst. You should've clearly and firmly told her- ideally in front of others also- something along the lines of \"stop commenting on my body and eating habits. You're body shaming me and you need to stop\".", "NTA she kept attacking and making rude remarks about yout appetite and looks. She can dish it but not take it?", "Esh she shouldn't have kept saying those things to you but \"fat f@ck\" was also out of line.", "NTA. She bodyshamed you badly, didn't care abount boundaries. Well, mess around and found out. What you say was obviously not nice but maybe this girl needed that reality check", "She had no right to be commenting on your body and diet all the time, clearly, you were triggering her issues but it's not your fault (from what you tell us). Your exit line was funny and yeah, fatphobic, but considering her behavior she had it coming. NTA, assuming that you're not conveniently leaving things out and also assuming that you let her know her comments were annoying you before escalating to the \"fat f\\*ck\" line.", "Nta.\n\n And for those saying that she should stick up for herself, she was in another country with a host family. I bet nobody told the other girl to shut it and considering her AH parents reaction how many of you wouldn't also just explode on the last day. The other girl is a bully and no bully gets to cry victim when their target fights back.", "NTA, the only reason I'd consider ESH is due to the fact that you didn't stick up for yourself sooner. \n\nPeople like her are completely rotten, no heart to heart  or appeals to emotion will work here. You were completely in the right to get nasty, I think you could have even gone in for a lower blow. She has a mental disease caused by everyone around her being too damn nice, a couple cruel words will do wonders for her condition.\n\nI wouldn't take it too hard over how her parents reacted, it is very unlikely she told them the full story. Don't apologize, you'll only be enabling future antisocial behavior.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand how someone could think ESH, you were taking the hate from her for way longer than you should've. Even though you stooped down to her level, she deserved it. I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself.", "ESH\n\nShe is way out of line for continuing to make you uncomfortable commenting on your body.  She obviously has issues and I hope she gets help.\n\nYou know why you're TA and it sounds from the comments like you're going to apologize and move on.  Good for you.", "ESH.\n\nShe was out of line and so were you.  There were better ways to handle this.  Instead, you stooped to her level.\n\nBodyshaming isn't cool regardless of body type.", "ESH.  \nYes, you're justified in feeling angry and annoyed when someone is taking out their obvious insecurities on you - she is definitely an asshole for that.  \nHowever, you did not need to respond in kind, and by doing so, you made yourself an asshole as well.  \nBeing able to put up with other people acting ridiculous without sinking to their level is an important skill in life, and reacting negatively to other people also shines a light on negative aspects of yourself. Don't let people get to you like this - understand that this person is saying things to you because she is deeply insecure.", "NTA. She poked the bear and saw the results", "I was you at that age.  Genetics. 100lbs when I graduated HS.  University my roommate asked my how I \"dieted\", and if I throw up my food.  Nobody believed me.. and I've never thrown up there period.\n\nI'm late 30s and 130lbs now.\n\nIt pays off ;)  they are jealous.\n\n Not 4 days ago I got told by a 300lb woman I need to \"gain 30 lbs.

You just sank down to her level.", "ESH.  Although I know it is hard to do, you should have called her on her comments at the beginning.  It doesn't sound like you did anything to talk to her about how her comments made you feel, and then to explode on her at the end was a bit much.  I understand why you did it, but you can't ignore something for weeks and then blow up finally and expect that you're going to be excused because of someone else's behavior.", "YTA, but sometimes you need to be and it's fine to be an asshole in life \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "ESH  \n\n\nBody shaming is bad no matter which way it goes", "I'm going with ESH. That girl was way out of line, and I suspect she was feeling insecure (this explains, does not exonerate). You swallowed her insults until you couldn't take it any more and exploded like hot lava.  You are young, and you have time to think of a calm response for next time someone says something insulting to you. TBH, it probably would not have ended well, regardless; the important thing is that, going forward, you feel you did your best to honor who you are.", "esh", "NTA. \n\nHowever, I am concerned by many of your comments. Specifically you being on a diet while already small, claiming you aren\u2019t hungry many times, your almost idealization of thinness. Be careful. EDs can be triggered at any time. I don\u2019t care about that bully, but I am slightly worried by your attitude. Take care of yourself.", "ESH. I was on your side until \u201cyou fat f*ck.\u201d You know that was wrong.", "ESH. You were poorly treated for months. But as others said,  the last part of your statement pushed it over the edge in AH territory", "My question is\u2026did you address it with her the first 50 times she said it? Or did you keep your feelings bottled until you exploded at her like you did? If you never addressed the issue, then how was she to know what she said was bothering you like it was? If that\u2019s the case then you are TA. If it was previously addressed and she just ignored your feelings about it then she is TA.", "NTA \n\nshe body shamed you the whole time, completely out of jealousy, and you lost it in the last nerve, you had the reason to do so", "I was so sure you were in the wrong, but then I read the story. NTA. She pushed and pushed. She wouldn't stay off that topic, and you finally exploded.", "ESH - you both were body shaming each other.  Not appropriate.", "ESH, but she\u2019s more of the asshole then you because she started it. She was saying that stuff because she is obviously jealous of your body and insecure about being big. She shouldn\u2019t have started it. She was being a bully. You can only push people so far so I don\u2019t blame you. \n\nYou kinda suck a little but barely, because you went nuclear on her by calling her a fat f$ck, which is completely understandable. It\u2019s going to be hard for her to recover. That might scar her for life. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I know, boo fucking hoo. \ud83c\udfbb\ud83e\udd0f\ud83c\udffc\n\nBut seriously, even though you got to tell her off it may cause you more confrontation in the long run. Problematic people like her are just baiting you so it\u2019s best to choose your words more carefully because they are just looking for a fight. They want to be the victim and you just played right into her trap. Now she is getting her parents involved, drama drama drama. Now she can pretend to be bullied by the skinny pretty girl and get attention. But it\u2019s ok. It\u2019s a learning opportunity. Next time don\u2019t fall for this. Next time people like her pull this crap just agree with them and be like \u201cyeah I work hard for this body\u201d. \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc", "ESH. Yes, she was way over the line but you could have reacted in many ways. The one you chose makes you an AH. She clearly has some deep-seated issues and you have made those a lot worse.\nEdit: In response to the comments, there is no doubt the other girl was a major bully and I\u2019m in no way condoning her behavior, but OP had so many choices in how she acted and spoke. She chose the absolute most AH way to react and escalated the situation.", "NTA- \n\nI hate how many people think things are \u201cfat phobic\u201d but when it\u2019s about someone who isn\u2019t overweight they call it attention seeking. I\u2019m tall and when I was younger and going through growth spurts I was a little thinner (not quite underweight) and every girl I ever met who was a little on the heavier side would always find a way to bring it up in a passive aggressive way.  \n\nSounds like this girl just got a taste of her own medicine", "ESH\n\nYou don't get a free pass just because she started it.", "ESH... I do feel for you, I was very skinny during high school and had to endure the same comments and couldn't say a word, because most people consider only comments about someone's weight as insulting if it's about fat person - like telling someone they should eat more, when they eat normally, is compliment and not an insult.\n\nHowever, you can't be angry at what she told you, when you did the same - your response was very harsh, esp. because you nowhere say anything about her eating too much.", "Things that never happened for $2000 please.", "ESH.\n\nWould have been NTA if you didn\u2019t add \u201cfat f*k\u201d", "Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. ESH", "NTA. Don't dish it out if you can't take it.", "NTA. Thinphobic is a thing too.", "ESH- she shouldn\u2019t have been constantly commenting on your body and eating habits and you didn\u2019t need to name call her. Being frustrated or fed up still doesn\u2019t justify our bad reactions.", "i laughed out loud at that final response, and that's coming from a fat f\\*ck XD i think she deserved it!", "ESH. you both bodyshamed each other, but you were pushed to the edge so she is more of an AH than you were and she is a bit hypocritical for getting so upset at what she\u2019d been dishing out. but imo being fatphobic or resorting to any sort of bigotry to defend yourself is not okay, especially when the weight is so different on a societal and discriminatory level. \n\nskinny people are definitely allowed to be insecure and no one should be shamed for their natural body, but it\u2019s also important to remember the imbalances outside of interpersonal matters. you were right to defend yourself, but just call her a bitch next time.", "ESH - you both attacked each other. Whether or not one of you deserved it probably depends on the perspective of the storyteller.", "If only she did a star jump every time her insecurities judged someone.. nta", "NTA, shutting down a person who constantly insults you isn\u2019t asshole behavior. She got what she deserved.", "NTA. Skinny shaming is just as bad as fatshaming. She fucked around and found out", "NTA.\n\nFrom what it sounds like, she's just randomly biting at you while you're minding your own business. I think she went far by saying you're \"anorexic\".\n\nI almost voted E S H because of the \"fat f*ck\" thing but again from it sounds like, she clearly started it and she got mom and dad to defend her. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI recently learned that people don't like to get called skinny and despite my bubble gut I still know how it feels being called fat or skinny.\n\nEdit: forgot to say why I almost voted E S H", "ESH, with a close Y T A. Repeated, unkind, and/or callous comments about size are unnecessary for ANYONE. She didn't need to harp on your physique and you certainly didn't need to fat shame her. I get how irritating and rude she was, but in the long run, responding as you did does damage as well.", "NTA\n\nShe was pathetic for insulting you out of jealousy, you responded to her the best way possible. Have a good day, ignore the idiot", "Just because there's something she doesn't like about herself doesn't give her a license to rip into everyone around her.  As the saying goes, those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.  Only thing she proved is she can't take what she dishes out on a regular basis and is a hypocrite regardless if she's skinny or fat.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nyour 16 I do not expect you to put up with such bs. though she could just be concerned about your health (Then NAH)\npeople don't expect adult level maturity from f'ing kids", "Hahahahahaha NTA.\n\nShe got what was coming to her. End of story.\n\nYou're hilarious.", "i dont know why people are saying ESH. she fucked around and found out. thats simply life. NTA", "ESH\n\nJust because she felt the need to comment on your body, doesn't mean you have to stoop to her level and comment on hers. You could've chose to be the bigger person and let it go, but you only made the situation worse. People struggle with body image on both sides of the spectrum, and it should come from a place of understanding and education instead of petty name-calling.", "ESH.\n\nNothing she said was right or appropriate, but that is separate from your response here. \n\nYou could have addressed her body shaming without fat shaming.", "ESH bc while she deserved it, you simultaneously insult everyone else her size who didn\u2019t deserve it. That\u2019s the whole problem with insulting people\u2019s appearances.", "Everyone has a biting point, you reached yours.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThat girl is immature and very insecure about herself and her body. She made these comments because of her self esteem issues and she was probably jealous of the way you look.\n\nI get why you snapped, I probably wouldn\u2019t have called her a F** F*** though. But it was the heat of the moment.\n\nI would apologize for the comment but point out her comments and behaviour. Tell her it\u2019s not your fault she\u2019s insecure and that she should keep her nasty comments to herself and work on her own body and issues.", "NTA: \n\nGirl: I am going to insult a girl I barely know for being in shape\n\nOP: snaps, bites back (no pun intended)\n\nGirl- WhY sHe GoTtA bE fAtPhObIc FoR?", "Yeah YTA. It sucks to be made fun of for your weight and appearance, that wasn't cool of her at all. And then you did the same thing, except fat people are more likely to be killed by medical neglect and abused by those in their life so you went lower than her. It's not at all an exact comparison because they are two different issues, but if a person of color were to poke fun at a white person for being so pale and then that white person retaliated by saying the same things racists do to attack people of color we can all recognize the white person went way too far. \n\nYou should've gone after her personality or just hit her but you went for fatphobia and that's why YTA", "Pretty clear cut ESH I think.", "NTA. Do you think she deserve an apology after saying those things to you for uncountable times? You are guilty and feeling remorseful because you know how bad those words are, but will she ever feel the same? \n\nIf anything happens, tell them what she did, and tell them you will apologize only when she apologizes to you first.", "NTA. You played an Uno Reverse and she cried about it after racking you with multiple Draw 4's.", "NTA She started it.  Weight shaming goes both ways.  She needs to stay in her lane or be prepared for a sideswipe.", "NTA, based on what you've said, but as someone who has struggled with my weight my whole life, I can assure you that she has endured digs from skinny people her whole life. People are way kinder to underweight people than overweight people. Even doctors and other \"professionals.\" \n\nSo, maybe try and be empathetic in the future, and instead of attacking, just say that you don't think anyone should be commenting on anyone else's body. \n\nUnless, of course, there were some micro-agressions on your part. Then, totally YTA. Which, honestly, based on experience, I doubt there were not some sneaky, rude, or triggering comments from your end.

You don't need to put up with someone being mean to you like that. \n\nAfter the second time I would say something.  \"Please don't comment on my body, it's rude.\" Then if she wont stop, get petty!  Her jealousy is not your problem.", "Nta because she had it coming. It\u2019s sad she\u2019s got insecurities but she can\u2019t project that onto others.", "Yeah, you broke.  She made you run out of fucks to give.  NTA.", "NTA.\nSo she can insult you but the tables turned...suddenly it's wrong for you? Huge NTA.", "Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half. NTA, based of what you wrote, the other person habitually spoke to you in condescending and disrespectful way \u201c you need to eat more\u201d.

I was proud when I became more active, ate better, and lost weight.\n\nBut my family back home kept making remarks like \"Oh wow, you're so tiny you're just going to blow away.\"\n\nAnd it's funny how unacceptable it is to fat shame people, but it's perfectly OK to skinny shame someone.

And I wouldn\u2019t even say you have anything to be ashamed of even if you were a bit of an AH, because this is just a learning moment.", "Based on the information provided, ESH. With a tiny bit of extra information, I'd probably switch to NTA.\n\nI think we all agree that she was out of line for commenting so often about your body in so many different ways. \n\nBut friend, based on your description, you never asked her to stop. It seems like you literally went from zero to 100 in a split second.  So it might seem to her and her mother that your explosive insult came out of the blue.", "I\u2019ll say NTA bordering on ESH. You were 100% justified in putting her in her place, but that wasn\u2019t the way to do it.

Did she deserve to be dressed down? 100%! Was using the language of body shaming, even in an ironic way, the best way to do it? No.", "YTA. The only reason I am saying this is because it is FARRRR too common for people to deal with insults like this and try to ignore it, only to blow up and say something actually mean. Instead just stand up for yourself from the beginning!!!!! Tell her after every comment that you don\u2019t appreciate it, it\u2019s rude, and it makes you feel bad. If she doesn\u2019t stop escalate it to her parents and make sure they know how uncomfortable you are. If at that point you yell at her or say something mean, it\u2019s kind of understandable. I just can\u2019t believe the amount of people that ignore mean comments until they snap. That is NOT healthy.", "While I don't for a moment agree with what you said to her, I find it HILARIOUS that she thinks it's perfectly acceptable for her to comment about YOUR body and YOUR went and what YOU eat, but once the tables are turned, the pearls get clutched?  You took her shit gracefully and silently but the second you snap, YOU'RE somehow the asshole?  That's not how that works.  I'm not at all happy about what you said, but NTA.  She shouldn't start something she's not prepared to finish.", "body shaming goes both ways. had she made the remark once or twice, ok let it pass.... she's insecure. but constantly attacking your body shape, screw that, you couldn't take it anymore and honestly you do not have to feel guilty at all.", "Nah NTA she was body shaming you every chance she got.

She fucked around and found out.", "ESH. I think people miss the point of this subreddit. She was an asshole, you were an asshole back.

No matter what I did I just could not gain any weight. I mean I looked like I was starving myself despite eating more than anyone I knew.

Anyway there was a girl with the opposite problem I had and 1 day she just walks up to me for no reason and says \"you know you're disgustingly skinny!\" And my response was \"well your disgustingly fat!\" And she ran away crying I did not feel bad in the slightest because she started it. Same thing as what happened to you if this other person doesn't like people making comments on their weight then they should not be commenting on others because that tells everyone that they are ok with weight jokes", "NTA. She couldn't help but continue to comment on your body in a derogatory manner so she shouldn't be upset when you give it back to her. Also, calling someone anorexic is way over the line for a multitude of reasons. Classic case of a hater who can't handle taking her medicine.", "NTA she's insecure af about her weight, that's why she's projecting and making all those rude comments. If she don't wanna be said about the same things, she should put effort into keeping good shape.", "NTA\nIf she doesn't want people commenting on her weight then she should keep her mouth shut about the weight of others. \n\nShe's a hypocrite. She thinks it's completely fine for her to harass you about your body and eating habits because you're skinny but that it's not ok when you strike back in defense of yourself. \n\nCould you have handled it better?

I (16F) recently participated in a summer exchange program and went to abroad to a foreign country to study for the semester. Over there, I had a great time, was on good terms with my host family and friends, except one girl.\n\nThis girl had a different body type to me, she was slightly bigger. (I don't mean this in a rude way, she just was, she was still a good person). I do a lot of extracurriculars that require exercise so I stay in shape. The entire program, I had a feeling she hated me.\n\nAnything I said, whatever I did, she always found a way to say: \"Yeah it's because you're so skinny.\" and even went as far to call me \"anorexic\" when I told her I was on a diet. (This is a healthy diet recommended to me by medical professionals).\n\nIt kinda made me uncomfortable. Once, I suggested going swimming and she said, \"Of course you'd want to go swimming, you're the tiniest person here, you can show yourself in a swimsuit.\" Like, jeez.\n\nThere was one phrase she used, A LOT. \"You need to eat more.\" I have a small appetite, and I eat less than her, it's not that big of a deal girl...\n\nBy the last day, I had had it. It was my last day, I was so sad, I didn't want to leave my friends, and I wasn't feeling hungry. It was around the 50th time she told me, \"Girl, you need to eat more. I can like see your bones sticking out.\" and I freaked out.\n\nI was having a bad day. The last thing I needed was to deal with her, so I responded, \"Yeah? You need to eat less you fat f\\*ck.\"\n\nShe was shocked, and I left before a response. She texted me later and said she was shocked how fatphobic I was being and she's glad I left. She even got her parents to text and call me to yell at me.\n\nI am feeling bad, AITA reddit?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
