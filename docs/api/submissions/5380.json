She actively isn't caring about the symptoms you already have, she is dismissing medical advice. I imagine if it was her with the allergy, you wouldn't even have tried to push getting a cat on her.", "NTA\n\nI am hard on my way to becoming a \"crazy cat lady\".  I love my fur babies.  I also have allergies including a mild one to cats.  Mine are at a level I can have my kitlings and manage the allergies.  I can't imagine having allergies at a level where I would have to choose.  \n\nThat being said: Your health is top priority. 100% top priority.  \n\nYou need to rehome your cat - take the time if you can to find someone you know will take good care of it.  \n\nHonestly, I'd also consider a frank discussion with the girlfriend.

Your gf seems to have tunnel vision for this perfect life where you two have a cat and your allergies magically go away, and is forcing that image onto reality. Listen to your doctor, it might be time to ask your gf if she\u2019d rather rehome the cat or herself", "NTA. You should listen to your doctor.", "Definitely NTA here. Your girlfriend is. Incidentally my partner is allergic to cats but wanted one. I insisted on a meeting with the cat (met our cat, her bro and mum, so more allergen potential) beforehand, because there are cats out there he doesn't react noticeably to.\n\nYour gf needs a reality check. Health/needs above wants. One No supercedes every yes.", "NTA. Your doctor is the medical expert here (and apparently cares more about you than your girlfriend does). Your health matters.\n\nThis needs to be an ultimatum: Either the cat goes, or you do. You cannot live with a cat.\n\nA girlfriend who doesn't care about your health isn't much of a girlfriend, btw.", "NTA. You may also have been unlucky in your choice of cat. Some breeds of cat are less likely to cause allergy symptoms, at least for some people. There are something like 8 different proteins emitted by cats that can cause allergies, and cats can shed these in greatly varying proportions. Some people are allergic to all the proteins -- there is no hope for them! Other people may just be allergic to a subset, and not have a reaction or only a minimal reaction to some cats. For instance, Cornish Rex and Siberian Forest Cats, as well as possibly Russian Blue are known to cause less reaction in many otherwise allergic people.\n\nI grew up allergic to cats -- at least most cats. It was worst if I stroked a cat and then touched anywhere near my face. (This contrasts with a couple of friends I have who are so allergic they can walk into a house and immediately have a reaction, and say, \"Oh, I didn't realise you had a cat,\" and have to leave again immediately.) But having read about Cornish Rexes, I went to visit a breeder and sat there, piled up with cats for about two hours, and didn't have any reaction, except where one of the kittens licked my hand and it came up red. So I got a couple of kittens, and never had a reaction to them. But maybe they had enough of the allergens to be like a homeopathic dose, because after a few years I realised I wasn't allergic to any other cats anymore. \n\n(Your meowlage may vary.)", "NTA... It doesn't sound like you're enjoying life to the fullest with this cat in the house. This is what should be concerning your girlfriend.

My wife also always wanted a cat, but she knows I\u2019m allergic, so we don\u2019t have a cat. \n\nIf someone doesn\u2019t take your health seriously, you shouldn\u2019t take that relationship seriously, imo.", "NTA your health comes first", "Ask your girlfriend this question:\n\nHow would you feel if you were allergic to wool, and I insisted you wear a wool sweater every day?\n\nIt would mean that I cared not about your health or comfort.

If y'all had a child together, she probably wouldn't give a shit if your kid was allergic, too.", "NTA, IMO girlfriend is TA and i say this as a cat person. if the allergy isn\u2019t manageable with antihistamines and the cat could lead your health to significantly worsen, you gotta get rid of the cat. asthma is forever, and with all the love i have for cats, they\u2019re definitely not worth a lifetime of panting and wheezing.", "NTA. Listen to your doctor. There is absolutely no reason at all to sacrifice your health for a cat. Sure it\u2019s nice to have a pet, but not when you\u2019re constantly living with allergies and the risk of developing asthma because of it. Your gf is being very unreasonable and quite uncaring of your health here.", "NTA dude no way you don\u2019t want to drag this process out until your health deteriorates irreversibly.", "NTA Look up the difference between nose breathers and mouth breathers and it\u2019s effect on the face. My cat allergies clog up my nose so fast it\u2019s not even funny.", "NTA. Your girlfriend showed you her priorities when you first got diagnosed. She kept asking until you gave her the answer she wanted. She\u2019s not gonna change that tactic now because it works for her.", "NTA. When first looking for cats, you both should have researched cat breeds best for people with allergies and stuck with one of those breeds to see if it helped.", "NTA! You should totally listen to your doctor! Your health is top priority. It must suck to constantly have allergy symptoms! \nI have pretty bad cat allergies, I can\u2019t imagine living with one.

You KNEW you were allergic and still got the cat who now must be rehomed. Is the cat fully grown now? It's very hard to re-home a grown cat. Thousands are murdered in shelters every year. You knew there was a good chance you could not live with a cat and yet you got one. And your gf is an even bigger ah than you are. This is a life we are talking about. Not a decoration to be passed from one place to the next. Obviously you cannot live with this cat. But the cat is the one most at risk here.

Though if you like the cat and would like to try and keep it I would suggest air purifiers and banning it from the bedroom.  You can also look into getting allergy shots if thats something you want. There are also breeds of cats that are less bad for your allergies though no cat will be magically allergen free.  \n\nAs someone who has bad allergies but still lives with pets it did get better for me once I got exposed to the allergens for long enough, but just because something worked for me doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll work for everyone.

I have found that there are certain cat breeds that don't affect me the way others do. I now live with 2 Snow Leopard Bengals and I am fine with them.

Second of all you can get vaccinated against cat allergy, though it requires regular shots over a period of two years. Thirdly, and maybe most interesting for you, I read about a new vaccine that cats can get that neutralises what most humans are immune to in cats.", "ESH if you knew you have an allergy you should have fostered. For one thing different cats give off different levels of the saliva compounds that most commonly cause allergies so you\u2019d actually have a better chance of finding a cat that wont set you off and you wouldn\u2019t be giving up a cat and contributing to the problem of pets in shelters.", "I have 3 cats and I'm also severely allergic to them. I, however, got them before I found out I was allergic. I take allergy meds twice a day, have air purifiers and I also use nose sprays. I also use a nebulizer when needed. This works for me but it isn't for everyone. A pet is a huge commitment and it sounds like you physically cannot make this commitment. My allergist suggested shots and I've thought about it but it's a huge undertaking, it's a decision I'll make once winter ends. Regular grooming has helped with allergies as well. All in all if you really feel you cannot live with a cat your gf has to be considerate of that, at least I hope she would be. It would be unfair to keep it in a room all day as well. You're NTA for being allergic but you really should not have committed to getting one knowing you're allergic. Best of luck.", "Yes for the love of God don't fuck around!\n\nThat whole 'exposure' bullshit is complete nonsense and you need to follow the advice of a professional. \n\nMy sons in-laws almost killed him because they didn't believe me when I said none at all about his allergen. They firmly believed trace amounts would cause immunity. Absolutely not, almost lost him.", "Agreed.  My partner is allergic to cats, so we got a Siberian and an air purifier and he's generally fine without antihistamines. My SIL is also allergic and was very happy that she could finally pet a cat without feeling terrible!\n\nOP, NTA,she's not considering your wellbeing at all", "Exactly. OP YTA for getting the cat in the first place.", "If GF is a bigger AH then why isn't it ESH?", "Exposure works for me.  The more I'm around a cat the less sick I get.  When I went to college I started getting sick when I came home because of my cats so I started volunteering at the animal shelter and it fixed the problem.   My allergies aren't that bad though and anecdotal evidence proves nothing.", "It's excellent that it worked for you and I'm really glad you didn't get the opposite effect.\n\nTypically if exposure is to be undertaken, it needs to be under advisement of a qualified professional. \n\nMy sons immunologist advised me to expose him to peanuts super slowly (tiny bit of peanut butter in cupcakes or pancakes etc) because his anaphylaxis was going down in regards to peanuts, and we needed to encourage that.\n\nBut he had 7 fatal allergies, and all needed to be tested and then advice followed. We're down to one left now, but if I had of done exposure therapy without the testing and what not, it could have made it worse if not fatal. His last one will most likely never go away, and yet I'm constantly told by people to 'just give him a little'. \n\nAnd his chopped and changed. He was never allergic to fish, but because I fed it to him a lot (he was allergic to a lot of proteins), he developed anaphylaxis to fish from over exposure.\n\nAllergies aren't something to mess around with. It's crazy how many people don't know that a reaction can escalate to life threatening HOURS after exposure.\n\nI know I've ranted sorry, this topic just makes me so frustrated.", "I wouldn't risk it if I had serious allergies.   That would be way too scary."]}
