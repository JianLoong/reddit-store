We obviously cancelled the trip, and I\u2019m not upset with that at all. But once the trip was cancelled there had been a few weeks of deliberation on what we\u2019d get for Christmas instead. I want to make it very clear that I would have been happy just spending time with them, I don\u2019t really NEED a gift - but they offered each of us a very large sum of money for the holidays instead, I\u2019m talking more than my monthly income. This excited me because my husband and I have been taking on debt these past couple months due to some extenuating circumstances and we could finally get ourselves back to a good starting point. I was under the impression that we\u2019d be getting this money for about two weeks. Come to find out today that because my SIL and her boyfriend would like to join them on their holiday to Italy in the summer and they can afford to pay their flights and food on their own, his parents will cover the accommodation for their Christmas gift - and now instead of my husband and I getting the original sum of money we can plan a weekend getaway that they will pay for. It feels like a big slap in the face, they offered me basically my monthly income and instead are only going to give a prepaid weekend that I honestly don\u2019t even want? Not to mention the whole weekend would be over 1k cheaper than what they offered us to begin with?\n\nA lot of this frustration comes from the fact that we are the least well off in his whole family. His sister makes more in one pay than I do in a month and because they are military they pay hundreds less for their monthly bills. I want to tell his mom offering so much money just to take it away was actually kinda shitty because to them it\u2019s just a number, they don\u2019t realize how much we could\u2019ve used that to get to a good spot and it\u2019s infuriating. Not to mention I\u2019ve always hated the holidays with them because we can never afford the extravagant gifts that everyone in his family likes to give. So would I be the asshole? I\u2019d be calm and collected if I did talk to them but I want to tell them how hurtful it was that they can throw around numbers like that when we are barely scraping by in life.\n\n\nTLDR - when our holiday trip was cancelled my in laws offered an extravagant amount of money to each of us instead, just to take it away because my SIL can afford plane tickets to Italy and wants to join on their summer vacay. Now we get a spa weekend that I don\u2019t even want because we are in debt right now. I\u2019d like to tell my in laws that offering that sum of money to take it away is extremely rude", "created_utc": 1701375319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187rxkr/wibta_for_telling_my_mil_her_christmas_gift_feels/", "score": 349, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you not understand how it will come across if you just go up to them and say \"you mentioned giving us money, it's rude that you changed your mind\"? It'll make you look like a jerk and ruin your relationship with them forever, no matter how you try to justify it to them. And YWBTA, definitely.\n\nI'm guessing from your story that this was just an idea they were playing around with rather than a formal promise, then they changed their mind when your SIL brought up what seemed like a good idea for a less impersonal gift. They might have been more thoughtful of your financial situation (but is this something you talk about openly, explicitely and in concrete detail? they might be underestimating your problems), but from their perspective, they were probably trying to do the nice thing by offering something thoughtful they hoped you'd enjoy.\n\nI think you should talk it over with your partner and, if you're on the same page about this \"incident\", let him explain to his parents that you're in a bit of a tight spot and it'd be a huge help if they'd be willing to give you the value of the spa weekend in cash. If he feels differently, just get over it.", "YTA just for how you\u2019re phrasing it, but I don\u2019t think you would be the asshole if your spouse approached the ILs with something like \u201cthis is really generous but actually due to some financial issues we were really looking forward to putting the money toward some debts.\u201d Let your husband handle it though. \n\nYour feelings are valid but the ILs are likely just clueless. However I want to say that I completely get how frustrating this situation is and I think it\u2019s a great sign that you paused and got other opinions before acting out of your feelings. Capitalism is the real asshole here.", "YWBTA. I understand the frustration, but it's your in-laws money to gift and you're still getting a fairly sizeable gift. If you really don't want the weekend, just try asking for that weekend's worth of money so it still helps with your debt even though it's less than you expected to get. Also, that's a lesson to never expect a gift until it's actually given.", "YTA. Your debt, your problem. A spa weekend is a generous gift. You are not entitled to their money. Sounds like you\u2019re a bit jealous of your SIL as well\u2026", "YTA. A spa weekend is a generous gift. Your debt is your problem, not your in laws.\n\nCircumstances change, plans change. What they are gifting to you is still beyond what most people get. Say thank you and move on.", "YTA. It\u2019s a gift, you\u2019re entitled to nothing. \n\nIf money is the problem you say it is, your husband should nicely ask for $ in lieu of a weekend getaway.", "YTA.\n\nWow. Talk about entitled. \n\nYou're getting a free vacation.", "YWBTA.  A gift is a gift.  You don't get to choose what you receive.  Honestly, you seem ungrateful.", "YTA.  They don't owe you a trip, a weekend,  and definitely not money to get you out of debt. You've become very entitled in this situation.  You can't possibly think it's OK to tell someone they owe you a better gift.", "Yes, YTA. If you and your husband so desperately need the cash, your husband can approach his parents to ask for a loan or for the cash Christmas gift. YOU do not go around telling people what a slap in the face it is to you personally. They decided to change the amount that they'll gift and it may have more to do with re-evaluating the total outlay of cash in light of all of the medical bills they will be receiving soon. It could be they decided they want to treat their cat to a monthly spa day. Regardless of their reason, it is their money.\n\nI do want to restate the obvious - YTA", "YTA - Your in-laws do not exist to fulfill your false expectations. Your frustration is rooted in what you created: acquired debt, envious views, expectations they owe you 'X' when they don't.  You are hurt cause you think they owe you. You are entitled. Change your focus to you: What can you do to change and resolve your life issues?", "YWBTA. There is no gracious way to tell somebody that you don't want the gift they're offering and that you prefer cash, no matter your financial circumstances. It's incredibly boorish behavior.", "YTA. You know you can turn down the spa weekend, right? You and your husband ran up debt and counted on something you should never have counted on. Don't count your chickens and all that.", "YTA - *I want to make it very clear that I would have been happy just spending time with them, I don\u2019t really NEED a gift*\n\nThen why are you here complaining?  Oh because of what you and your husband have done to yourselves:\n\n*because my husband and I have been taking on debt these past couple months due to some extenuating circumstances and we could finally get ourselves back to a good starting point.*\n\nYou and your husband made the choice to be in this situation.  Whether you are at fault or not, you have taken on the responsibility.\n\nYou sound very entitled and annoying.  Your debt is just that, your debt.  What the others in the family are doing with their life and how much money they have has absolutely nothing to do with where you and your husband are because of your choices.  No one owes you a damn thing.  Stop trying to guilt the family into giving you their money to bail you out.", "So, teensy bit of advice: Don't be this person - My ex-SIL was big on crying poor to everyone and expecting the inlaws to dish out cash because of her crying. It made everyone uncomfortable.\n\nWhat you can say is this: That is very thoughtful of you but I cannot enjoy a spa weekend when we are in debt. I won't tell you how to spend your money but I would hate for you to waste it on something I cannot enjoy.\n\nAnd then be quiet. They owe you NOTHING. They may have less available cash than they expected (even great medical insurance comes with some gotchas that no one anticipates) and this is a compromise.\n\nIt is also a GREAT opportunity to suggest dialing down the level of fancy of gifts.\n\nSoft YTA for even thinking of chastising someone for thinking out loud about really fancy gifting and then becoming more practical.", "YTA. Damn the entitlement is wild.", "YWBTA if you raised it. It is their money, they can choose what to do with it.\n\nBut to me this is almost an E S H situation. Because you wouldn\u2019t be disappointed if it hadn\u2019t been mentioned. If the weekend away was a surprise gift it would be lovely. But because you were already told you were getting the money, it sits differently. \n\nMoney was offered, you accepted, and they\u2019ve gone back on that. Their choice of course. But you can feel disappointed.", "Your feelings are valid, but as they were originally offering the money as a gift, they are allowed to change their minds.\n\nNAH", "OP I can see how concerned you are that your FIL almost died. Every word you wrote drips of jealousy and entitlement to be honest. His sister does not pay less for bills - part of military pay includes a housing allowance either on base or off base in return for idk risking their life at a higher rate statistically than other jobs and having to move or deploy at a moments notice. If you think it is such a great salary why not join as well? \n\nIf anyone should say anything about the ever changing promised gift it should be your husband and not you as you will for sure come off as greedy to them as you do here. It is rude to promise something and take it away and for some people their promises are just that a promise that will blow away in the wind and never count on it until it is a tangible thing in your hand.  *My spouse and I were promised a 1/4 million dollar early inheritance that we shook hands on with his parents and witnesses and a few days later it was caboshed by another family member. Did it suck? yes. Was I upset? yes. Did I confront them? No... because a promise is only good once delivered.* \n\nI think you love your in-laws more for what they can do for you than for them as people. **YWBTA if you say anything to your MIL. Life sometimes sucks and is hard and we have to deal with it and move forward.** \n\nI am not dismissing your financial troubles as we have all had them and have them and it makes life so much more difficult but what can you do to to change that?", "YTA. I really expected this to end with something worse than the jam of the month club as the gift.", "Gentle YTA because it sounds like it could upset what is otherwise a good relationship w/yr in laws. Think about this: instead of mentioning how the money you're \"getting\" via the trip is less than what was offered before, why not suggest that instead of the trip you get the $$ that would've been spent on the trip, as you were looking forward to getting funds to help settle your debts. That way at least you'll get a gift you can use.", "YTA.  Why do you believe you're entitled to any of this at all?", "YWBTA.  It's a gift.  You can be disappointed in it, but calling it a \"slap in the face\" when someone is giving you an expensive gift reeks of entitlement. Doubly so if the surgery came with a large medical bill.", "YWBTA. \n\nAbsurd levels of entitlement.\n\nIt's nobody elses fault or problem that you're barely scraping by. First you were being offered a trip to Jamaica that you had no problem with, and then the money, and now a spa weekend, and you're upset about it?\n\nWhat does the spa weekend even have to do with you being in debt, other than the fact that you would have preferred the money? if you didn't have a problem with a christmas vacation, I don't see why you have a problem with a spa weekend.\n\nIn any case, if you breach this topic at all with your in laws, you will forever taint your relationship with them. They will see you as entitled and ungrateful, and will almost certainly be less willing to help you out in the future.", "I think you have to keep in mind that the original plan was to gift you a trip. That's what they wanted to do, and it seemed like you were perfectly happy with that. \n\nForget everything else for a second, imagine they told you about the Jamaica trip, and you responded with \"well actually we would just like the money instead.\" I think everyone would recognize why that is pretty tacky. So, I don't think that basic situation has really changed all that much just because there were some other ideas thrown around, that's why you are getting called an a-hole. \n\nThe actual $$ of the trips don't really matter that much either.\n\nOn the other hand, if you really won't be able to actually enjoy or take advantage of the spa weekend, then that is worth bringing up. You could suggest an alternate trip or like have your husband make it make clear that you guys won't have an opportunity to take a trip next year or whatever. The best way would be to find a way to politely turn down the spa weekend and let the parents come up with an alternative. But at no point do I think you should bring up the difference in cost, that would be a super A-hole move. You should avoid making it about your financial issues, that makes you sound like you are begging for charity. \n\nSo, NAH... yet. But you would be if you told her what you wrote here.", "NAH. I think it's just your husband's place to have this conversation. Why have them waste money on a gift you don't want? I would absolutely hate getting a spa weekend for a gift and I'd hate someone wasting their money on it if I could stop it. I'd tell my parents that in a heartbeat, so it's your husband's job to say something.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a dramatic conversation. \"Hey mom and dad, you had been talking about giving us cash for the holidays but were also debating a weekend trip instead. If it's all the same to you, we'd prefer the money. It would go along way right now.\" Done.\n\nIf they are reasonable people, it won't be an issue.", "Never count your chickens before they hatch comes to mind. YTA for counting the cash before it\u2019s in your hands.", "YWBTA Try to learn to be grateful for what you get.  It doesn't matter what people make.  I understand the stress of your debt, I have debt too that stresses me out.  I do not expect Christmas gifts to help me out of that debt.  I am actually the person that is thrilled to get an updated family picture framed from my kids or mother.  \n\nYou will find you feel better if you allow your mood to just go with the flow and be happy, no matter what.  You will also be a better person to hang around.  Go on the weekend trip and relax.  Stop being sour about everything and just say \"thank you so much!\"  Maybe even add, \"I have been so stressed lately about our debt, this spa trip may help me unwind for a bit.\"  Don't say it with sarcasm, be genuine.", "YWBTA for telling them that you are bothered, but you aren't an AH for being bothered. \n\nSure, no one owes you a present or a sum of money, but it is okay to be hurt when someone OFFERS you something and then takes it back. My neighbor doesn't owe me a ride to the airport, but if he offers one and then cancels, I get to be a little miffed. \n\nThey got your hopes up, you likely planned for that money, and now you are disappointed, and that is totally fair. But telling them that is a bad idea, because you will seem ungrateful and it will cause conflict. Instead, I suggest speaking to your husband and deciding on a path forward that HE handles, not you. He should be the one dealing with conflict with his parents. One suggestion would be for him to tell his parents \"we really appreciate the weekend away but actually would prefer money because we have had a tight couple of months, if you would be okay with that, and it could be the amount that the weekend getaway would cost you.\"\n\nIt is totally appropriate for people to ask for what they need, and what they want, and it should come from him, and his parents will either say sure and give you some sum of money even if it was less than promised, and it may help them appreciate how different their financial situation is from yours.", "YTA for how you are going to frame it. No one owes you money, but I get it\u2019s disappointing to expect something that could help you so much and then not get it. Ask for the value of the weekend in cash and say how that would really be a big help rather than a getaway.", "YWBTA. Dont do this. Dont confront your MIL about a very generous gift. You weren\u2019t entitled to that money. You can feel disappointment about not receiving the money but you can\u2019t take out your disappointment on them. It is not their fault that you were viewing their gift as a way out of debt. They couldn\u2019t have known that and it isn\u2019t their responsibility. \n\nWhat does your husband say about all of this? Why would it be you confronting them and not him, assuming he agrees with your view?", "U do sound ungrateful. It\u2019s their money and they can share it how they feel like", "I can see where you're coming from, but I think you're coming at this from an unnecessarily combative angle. Rather than \"This is a slap in the face\" you should say something like \"Obviously what gifts you give us are your prerogative, and the spa weekend is a lovely offer, but things have been pinched for us financially for a little while and I have to admit that we were overjoyed at the prospect of the financial gift you offered and having it revoked in favor of something like a spa weekend that's lovely but not going to make a difference in our lives long term the way the financial gift would have is a pretty big dissapointment\".\n\nYou say yourself that they don't realize how much you could've used the money, it's not really fair to be this kind of angry about the gift switcheroo if they aren't privvy to your finances. And you really shouldn't lead with a bunch of anger or call it a slap in the face unless they have a habit of using money to control you.\n\nETA: Others have mentioned that this should really come from your husband and not you, I completely agree and am a little mortified that didn't occur to me.", "Ywbta I get the disappointment, and maybe YOUR HUSBAND could bring it up with them bc they're *his* parents.    However, if he's happy with a trip, esp bc the original gift was a trip, you should not say anything other than 'thanks, we'll let you know where and when we decide to go'", "YWBTA if you say something about a GIFT for you. Your SO could say something if it\u2019s that bothersome. But like you say he\u2019s been recently hospitalized and is gonna have a lot of medical bills. \n\nIt will make you seem greedy if you say something.", "YWBTAH if you were to be so ridiculously foolish to tell your MIL that a GIFT - any gift tbh - is a \u201cslap in the face \u201c!   \nseriously, take a step back from all of your big feelings and think about what you just asked the world. Obviously, you would be a massive AH And I\u2019m pretty sure you know that. Yes, it sucks to be expecting to have stress, reduced by getting a bunch of debt paid only for it not happen, but nobody owed you a thing least of all a bunch of cash.", "YWBTA\n\nYou are being offered a very generous and thoughtful (you sound stressed tbh OP) gift. Complaining that you want money instead would come across as really rude and entitled. \n\nI imagine you feel pressure to maintain a lifestyle like your in-laws but it sounds like you aren\u2019t living within your means. Booking trips to Jamaica when you\u2019re in debt is absolute madness.", "Instead of lashing out at them, have you and hubby considered just talking to them about your situation and asking if they would be willing to give you the money they planned to spend on your weekend getaway? Just let them know that this would be so much more helpful right now and see what they say. YTA if you go with your original plan.", "YWBTA. It's rude to question the value of any gift you get, which is a good way to never get nice gifts again. \n\nIt's not anyone else's fault you have less than them. Be happy with what you have, because plenty of people have less than you.", "Greedy is never a good look. They owe you nothing. YTA", "Sorry - YWBTA to bring it up.\n\nThey don't *have* to give you anything.\n\nIf you wouldn't enjoy a spa weekend right now because of all the debts, well, the thing to do would be to *say* that.

It'll be a lovely present just getting to spend time with you guys at Christmas.\")\n\n(If their response to your saying you can't afford to take the spa weekend is to ask what you would like instead, please say something equivalent in price would you could afford to enjoy. Don't say you want the money present you THOUGHT you were getting.)\n\nI appreciate how disappointing it is not to get the kind of debt-annihilating money gift you thought for a couple of weeks you would get. But no: you can't ask for it and you can't say you're disappointed you're not going to get it and you *absolutely* can't say that in your view your sister-in-law doesn't deserve that kind of present, because all of those would be AH moves.", "Not only are you the jerk Op but you are so self entitled and ungrateful. Yes having Debt sucks and honestly you need to look into the Dave Ramsey method because clearly your way of thinking needs to be improved. The more I read your most the more spiteful and greedy you started to sound like. Who cares what other people are doing at Christmas time. Christmas despite what the world wants you to think isn\u2019t about being a self absorbed greedy jerk. It\u2019s about caring about others and frankly you have a home right and you have hot food? Running water? You have more than quite a few people do on this holiday season and you wanna whine and moan over a free holiday spa? Get yourself together lady and learn about being grateful and humble", "Simply politely decline the spa getaway and leave them be. Your feelings are valid they got your hopes up to be moderately stable and I completely understand that and then they rip the carpet out from under you. They should have never told you they're original gift idea. Just have a quiet cheap Christmas with your husband. There's no way you can talk to them about this and not sound like the entitled little brat even if your feelings of disappointment are valid. Just always remember that you can't rely on them and they are not people of their word.", "Gifts are given, not demanded. You can be disappointed but you cannot be rude about what they choose to give you. Are they rude about the gifts they get from you? Because they are worth much less than the other gifts they get and they could look down on you for it and be rude. But they don't do they? YTA", "YTA. Be grateful for the gift, even if it isn\u2019t just what you prefer. You\u2019re getting much more than most people could even hope for.", "Ywbta. It was cruel for your in-laws to offer a gift and then go back on it, though it sounds like their circumstances changed so it might just be they feel like they can no longer afford to give that amount of money or it was a misunderstanding. So it's almost an ESH. But you can't complain about a gift like this. You're not entitled to your in-laws' money and you started spending someone else's money in your mind.  Be gracious that they're giving you anything. You know you can't complain to someone that they're not giving you a more expensive gift, right? They don't have to give you anything. Your post sounds like you don't care about them. You just want their money.", "YTA and extremely entitled. It seems you have issues being the lower income couple in this extended family. A gift is a gift. Whether it's something you need, like or want, you never ask for it and you saw a gracious thank you. It's like no one teaches people manners anymore. Your in-laws don't owe you cash.", "Wow. YTA. It\u2019s not their problem that you have debt. You sound very entitled.", "YTA, choosing beggars being choosy.", "YWBTA\n\nDon\u2019t count your chickens before they hatch, as the old adage goes.\n\nA gift isn\u2019t guaranteed until it\u2019s in the hands of the recipient. I think it\u2019s a little odd they\u2019d tell you an exact amount if they weren\u2019t completely certain of that being the gift, but at the same time, could you have things out of context? Had they truly promised X amount, or was that idea floated along with others to replace the Jamaica trip? Not that it matters, it\u2019s still up to them to choose what -if anything- to give, and to whom.\n\nSpeaking of Jamaica, was that coming out of their bank account or yours? You aren\u2019t clear about that, but I am sure that money would go toward paying down some debt if it\u2019s now free for you to spend.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s their money and not your place to request any. The closest I\u2019d say to saying anything (and it should come from your husband) is that due to your finances, you wouldn\u2019t enjoy a spa weekend but would very much appreciate the cash value of said weekend to address your finances. Even that feels really gauche to me, but it\u2019s much less offensive than telling someone that their choice in a gift is a slap in your face.\n\nYou should also keep in mind that whether through gifts or loans you should not rely on extended family to aid you with your finances. I know you cite extenuating circumstances for accruing your debt, but regardless of reason, it\u2019s your responsibility. You cannot make your get-out-of-debt plan reliant upon Christmas and birthday money.", "YTA. You sound a tad entitled. Whining to your inlaws about the lesser gift is not going to help your relationship.\n\nAnd I don't get your financial situation at all. First you say you had to cancel your Jamaican holiday and then you tell us that you're in financial trouble. What sane person who is in a huge amount of debt is going to plan a holiday in Jamaica?", "NTA. However, if this were me, I would refuse the offer outright.

It\u2019s his parents and he should talk to them if he feels like it\u2019s a good idea. I understand being disappointed but I think this is a \u201ccounting your chickens before they hatch\u201d situation. \n\nAlso, I know we live in a time where we are always trying to out do each other. When it comes to them buying expensive gifts you can\u2019t afford to do. If you put a lot of thought into your gifts being meaningful then that should be enough. Accept where you are in life and try not to compare. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but with work you can get there.", "YTA. Do you know the meaning of \"gift\"?", "YTA. \n\nEntitled.", "YTA. Why did you have a Jamacian vacation planned if you are having so much financial difficulties?", "Ask your spouse to talk with his parents and tell them you\u2019re in a fix for credit card debt right now and digging out of that debt a little would be a much bigger gift of worry weight off your shoulders than any vacation might be.  Would they be okay with putting the gift cash toward the credit card debt instead of toward a vacation?", "Yes", "Yta I get socks or deodorant from my mil and I'm thankful for that as she doesn't have to get me anything, be grateful", "\nNope. Do not say anything.  Accept what they offer graciously and know that you can\u2019t count on them.  They have a golden child, and that will never change.  Forge your own path and do do without looking to them for anything. They suck!", "YWBTA. Be gracious. Be grateful. There is no way you can say what you are thinking of saying without causing serious family disharmony. What your ILs are apparently doing may not be right, but they have the right to do it. One suggestion: if they talk about prepaying your spa weekend for you, you (or your husband) might answer, \u201cthank you so much but money is really tight for us right now and so, if it\u2019s at all possible to have the money without the spa weekend we would really appreciate it.\u201d\n\nA final word: make sure you and your husband are not being pressured into spending more than you can afford in social situations with his family. That would breed money resentment and you don\u2019t need that. It\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about if you can\u2019t afford things your other ILs can afford. It\u2019s just reality and gifts should not be about the money.", "YWBTA if you told them they were rude. You could just ask your spouse to tell them instead of a spa weekend if they could just give you the money, it would be great because you really need it", "I'm over here thinking, your finances are problematic yet you had planned to go to Jamaica? That seems a bit irresponsible. Maybe I misunderstood something?", "Yes, this absolutely sucks but bringing it up will do nothing except damage your relationship. You still won\u2019t get the previously offered gift but you will get a lot of grief. This is a sign to never count your chickens with them. They may still be good people with some bad traits. YWBTA.", "Ywbta. Big time.\n\nYour fil at had a heart attack. Plans changed\n Things are hectic.\n\nI understand that you are disappointed. You are human but you keep that to yourself. \n\nAt most I'd have a brief convo saying that honestly, you are having some financial troubles and if they are still willing to give cash instead of a trip that it would be the most responsible and stress relieving thing for you.\n\nDon't ask for an amount. Don't complain if they say no. For all your know the new circumstances changed the finances and they are giving you a vacation that is already covered. \n\nBe grateful. If they only.give the weekend You can take it and have fun or politely decline", "YWBTA.  You come across as super bitter that your SIL is better off than you because they\u2019re military.  If you believe that\u2019s true, as long as you\u2019re under 40 you can still sign up, the Air Force is recruiting and you get great education benefits too.", "I feel this, I really do. My late IL\u2019s were horrible about this concept & it caused me to take everything they offered as mere suggestion until I saw the money. & they offered to buy us such stupid things that we never needed, or would buy my BIL something but never offer it to us. You can\u2019t count the present until you open it. It sounds like they are trying to make things feel fair & YTA if you talked to them about it. But you should talk to your partner about what you two need & he may be able to bring it up.", "INFO: what does your husband think about you bringing this up with his family? Presumably, he'll have a good idea of whether his family will think you're an AH or not.", "Please don\u2019t say anything to your IL. This post sounds incredibly entitled and rude. What right do you have to be angry about anything? It is a gift anda generous one at that considering your FIL just had heart surgery. I get that you feel disappointed that the free money you thought was coming your way is no longer coming, but there is nothing that says your in laws have to pay for your debt. They can gift whatever they want to you and if you don\u2019t like it, then you smile and say thank you. But you don\u2019t go and complain about it to them as if it were \u201ca slap in the face.\u201d That\u2019s incredibly rude, tacky, and entitled. Just all around disgusting behavior. YTA.", "It sounds like they have the means and would help you out if you and your husband approached them and told them you are in a tough spot. \n\nOr he can tell them the two of you would prefer cash over a weekend trip. \n\nI would NOT suggest you tell them you are angry bc that comes off as seriously rude and entitled on your part.", "YTA. It\u2019s a gift. You take what you get and smile and say thank you. Especially considering it seems everyone is getting treated the same.", "I think you should talk to your inlaws about how you struggle financially and a weekend somewhere else would be nice but would not solve any problem- then ask if you could instead have the money they were prepared to spend on your weekend getaway because it would give you a bit more security.\nThey probably just think that just giving money is boring.", "YTA. Greedy, self centered, jealous, ungrateful, spoiled\u2026\u2026.need I go on?", "Yes YWBTA if anyone should talk to them it shoul be your husband. But no matter how you word it its going to come off as ungrateful, it sounds like they were trying to give a thoughtful gift and not just throw money at yas.", "Yes YWBTA if anyone should talk to them it shoul be your husband. But no matter how you word it its going to come off as ungrateful, it sounds like they were trying to give a thoughtful gift and not just throw money at yas.", "YTA. I get the disappointment but you\u2019re acting hella entitled. When you are given a gift, you say thank you. No \u201cthanks, but\u2026\u201d no \u201cI\u2019d prefer\u2026\u201d just thank you. Full stop.", "I agree with your last paragraph. There's absolutely a tactful way to explain \"we really appreciate the gesture and are grateful for whatever you get us, but given our current situation, we'd be able to appreciate the value of the trip a lot more than the actual trip.\" If the ILs are reasonable this shouldn't be offensive at all. I hate giving presents the receiver won't appreciate/be able to use.", "This is good advice.  And definitely your husband should be the one to discuss this with them, not you.", "Absolutely positively agree.", "If i offer to do something for you , you didn't go out of your way to ask - I came and offered it to you AND you make plans on that understanding only to have me renege last minute \n\nAm I NTA? I think I would be", "These posts always bug me the most. Grown ass adults getting upset about Christmas presents. Once you are an adult on your own Christmas presents should just be thoughtful gifts. It's just so weird to me that adults with careers have bigger expectations than kids writing letters to Santa.", "Agree. YTA. A gift is a gift. Thats it. You don\u2019t dictate what you receive. Solve your own money problems. You should feel embarrassed.", "I laughed at the TLDR when OP says she thinks her in-laws are 'rude' for changing the gift. Like seriously!? OP doesn't understand the in-laws are giving a GIFT not a bloody cash handout.", "Exactly. And the Jamaica trip would have required more time away from work than a weekend getaway, so it should be a step up given the money problems.", "Absolutely this is a conversation husband needs to have not op. The spa weekend feels expensive for the sake of it when honestly the value would give you more joy by relieving a bit of debt stress. It's not clear why sils availability has anything to do with ops holiday and I'm wondering if they're kind of flaky folk who enjoy talking about how generous they're going to be more than actually giving.", "To be fair, they might not think it\u2019s a life changing amount. Like I\u2019m from a military family, living in a military town, I\u2019ve never heard of people thinking military make a ton of money before\u2026(they make much more in the private sector!) and she also said a weekend getaway is only $1,000 less. So I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re talking like $2,000-$3,000 They might not realize how little the op makes or that they\u2019re in debt and would really like the money.", "I think part of the problem is that the amount is life changing for OP, but not for the in laws, for them it\u2019s just money designated for gifts, and considering that they have enough to gift several family members then the in-laws might not even register it.\n\nOP needs to get over the habit of comparing how much she makes versus what other family members make and their lifestyles. Her life will be miserable if she keeps that up.", "Sure, but most people don't consider a month's wages to be a life changing amount of money, and OP's in-laws aren't aware that to her it feels like it would be.", "Then they would have already bought the gift, so that would be the worst time bc they'd be out the money for that, and asked to fork out cash on top of the weekend.", "While we don\u2019t all deploy to combat zones, most of the military will spend a good portion of time away from family and loved ones for things like trainings, exercises, out to sea(navy), and non combat deployments. And most are in a ready state to go to combat should the need arise. Also the cushy office job also comes with working parties on the side, like sweeping rain.", "I'm sorry, but as a person with two military kids, your statement that they are \"getting way more benefits than a typical office worker...\" is rubbish. In a wartime scenario, there are massive numbers of non-combat deaths. If you sign up, they can and do send you even if you are admin. \n\nThey also do NOT get \"cushy benefits.\" Have you ever been to a VA hospital? Do you know anything about the level of care veterans get? It is garbage. That's why there's organizations that fight veteran suicide - 22 a DAY is the average for veteran suicide. \n\nYour whole post is inaccurate. OP's comments about how the military family has so much - my son made more working for Hobby Lobby at age 17 then he ever did in the military and was literally on call 24/7/365 with no overtime and no recourse for crappy leadership. His choice, and he was glad to serve, but watching it from afar, what you wrote is just simply not true.", "And the recruiting office is open to everyone.", "In laws are replacing a vacation with a vacation. I understand where they are coming from. No one in the family is stress free and thinking the most clearly right now.", "Yeah that\u2019s what got me, I\u2019m from military and in military, and while the pay is steady I\u2019m most certainly not living in the lap of luxury over here\u2026\u2026", "And presumably they just lost a lot of money cancelling a holiday last minute, and a lot of income because FIL isn't going back to work anytime soon (let's not even think about medical bills).\n\nThey probably just did the maths and figured out they couldn't pay for a Jamaican holiday twice.", "Sil isn't responsible for the parents changing the gift. They had a heart attack and op is being kinda petty and self centered.", "That\u2019s because they suck.", "Good post. You're the only one who called her out on her extreme anger, over not being given cash, from her post heart attack inlaws who she admitted already do a tonne of stuff to help them out.\n\nShe'll be the type to ignore them when they're old and sick but expect a  big inheritance.\n\nAll a one way street for this one. But don't be mistaken, she was totally cool about missing the Jamaica trip.", "But please enjoy your healthcare! I miss being my dad\u2019s Tricare dependent!!! :P the benefits and perks far outweigh the pay check\u2026at least from my experience\u2026", "My brother is in the Australian Navy. I actually earn $10K more than him. \n\nBut due to subsidised housing and other benefits he gets he has more money than I do. (And his super balance is INSANE as he\u2019s been paid at 15% for 10+ years)", "Sorry fil who just had a heart attack isn't being enough of an ATM for you. Entitled much?", "Yeah military medical is broken\u2026 my friend almost lost her leg and now has to get a third surgery for compartment syndrome that she received on a field exercise, because she was told it was in her head. My other friend got raped and was told there were no psychologist or therapists with openings to help her. Another had a brain tumor and just straight up wasn\u2019t told for a year. Another girl was fainting during general quarters and for six months was told to stop taking before her dad paid for testing and discovered she had a condition. Military medical is free because it\u2019s not great.", "Dependents get better care than service members usually.", "Oh I remember thinking tricare sucked as a dependent\u2026crazy wait times, etc. but then when I had my own insurance I realized it was much worse on the civilian side (ime, anyway). And at least tricare saved me about $13,000 a year between premiums, deductibles, and copays."]}
