The bottom half of the first paragraph is all praise about your niece and her looks, but that same energy isn't returned with your daughter. I'm picking up that you favor your niece more because of this, and I'm sure your daughter has too.\n\nI would've thought that an esthician mom would help her daughter take care of her skin more unless it's a medical issue rather than a hygiene issue (in that case, you're 2x TA).", ">I finally snapped and told her that I won\u2019t be using her she doesn\u2019t take care of her skin and it shows and because drawn on eyebrows will not help me at all. \n\nYeah yta. You're the grown up (theoretically at least) and something tells me this isn't the first time you've favoured niece over your daughter because of her appearance.\n\nYou had so many other options, you didn't want to exploit your own daughter, you needed (as you said) a more middle Eastern skin tone or even gods forbid, you could have acted like the actual adult and just said \"that's my final decision and I'm not changing it\".\n\n>not everything is fair in business\n\nIn ten or twenty years your daughter will parrot this back at you when you say it isn't fair she doesn't come visit.", "YTA- keep your ugly criticism to yourself when talking about kids, especially to them.", "YTA for what you said to your daughter. As someone who has struggled with bad skin all their life from hormonal imbalances and it having nothing to do with how I take care of my skin\u2014 it would devastate me if my mom told me I have bad skin even though its true. You\u2019re her mother, you\u2019re supposed to make her feel like she\u2019s the most beautiful, smartest, most capable person in the world. You have just given her a reason to believe in her insecurities.", "YTA\n\nSome things really should not be said, and this was one of them.", "YTA\n\nYou should make it clear on your website that it's only worth booking your services if your skin is already nearly perfect..", "YTA.  You could have easily said it was because she is under 18 but instead you made her insecure and slammed her appearance.  \n\nThis is a deep cut that she will remember forever and you really don\u2019t even seem to care.

Just your careless disregard for your daughter. That\u2019s all. You know", "What your daughter heard was you view your niece as beautiful and worth showing off and not her. She's not a professional model who is used to hearing what you said. But your child who heard that her own mother thinks she is ugly (something she already thinks) and her cousin is beautiful and worth the spotlight. You needed to not treat this like business. You probably should have used someone outside the family or at least not her cousin who probably already is very praised in the family for her looks.", "YTA. First, you shouldn't have used your niece at all; you should've anticipated your daughter's reaction. Second, you could have said literally *anything* else: that you don't use under-18 models, that you genuinely felt you needed someone with darker skin because most of your clients share her complexion, that you didn't want pictures of you minor daughter on her website, etc., and then apologized for using another member of the family and agreeing to look outside the family from now on.", "I was going to vote YTA from the title alone\u2026 Now that I\u2019ve read your post, I\u2019m doubling down on that. You are indeed the AH. **YTA** all the way. \n\nI have questions, but realistically, the one that I\u2019d really like answering is: as an aesthetician (I\u2019m UK, so leave my spelling alone), would you not be the best person qualified to help if you daughter really does have bad skin? One would have thought that with your job, you\u2019re in the best place to help her out, if it\u2019s truly a problem. \n\nBut with or without an answer, you were most definitely an asshole here. You *should* and could have just paid a model to do this, so as not to cause a divide in your family.", "YTA. Clearly you're so focused on outward looks that you forgot the importance of acting like a decent human being.", "YTA! You should have just doubled down on the Middle Eastern thing. Why did you have to insult your daughter!?! That will really affect her self esteem-you have probably scarred her for life.", "YTA and not very good at your job if you can't use after pics of your daughter once you've given her the treatment you want to advertise.", "YTA\n\nWhat is wrong with you?  This is how you speak to your child?  \"Not everything is fair in business\" this isn't actually *about* your business, it's about your parenting.  And, wow, you've really stepped in it here on that front.  FFS half your post is just waxing poetic about how beautiful your niece is.", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you just say because you aren\u2019t 18 yet?", "YTA come on\n\nYou know skin - for teens - is not just about what you do to it. \n\nAnd sure, your niece might be more suitable for your target market - but that's all you needed to say. You didn't need to engage more you just chose to.", "YTA,\n\nJezus christ you are an asshole. Also using someone with already perfect skin for your promos. Why not use this moment to help you daughter improve her skin and show the results? Or do both of them?", "YTA\n\nLol; how in the world would anyone call you NTA here? Did you even have to ask? \n\nYTA", "Wow, YTA and really mean. \nI don't care how much she was insisting, this is exactly what you should never say to your daughter. You literally should have come up with any other excuse, and you should've done this beforehand. What teenager wouldn't ask why they aren't getting a photo shoot for their parent's website? \nOr you could've not used your niece for this and hired a model or something, which would have been more sensitive and professional.", "YTA. In a few years, you won't remember this at all, but your daughter will always remember your words.", "YTA. Who uses the phrase \u201cit\u2019s just business\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s a business\u201d in relation to their own child? Yikes.", "Come on, YTA. That\u2019s cold as hell, NGL.

If I were you, I\u2019d apologize.", "yta\n\nwhy could you not explain to her that you were looking to advertise to specific ethnicities and therefore needed said ethnicity's specific physical features?\n\nInstead, you went ahead and decided to be a jerk to your own daughter.", "YTA\n\nMy heart hurts for your daughter. What a cruel and unnecessary response. I see no reason why you couldn't use both girls' photos.

How else was your daughter supposed to interpret what you said to her? And news flash, but not every client that walks through those doors, is going to have \u2018nearly perfect skin\u2019, good business is showing that you work with all sorts of skin types. Also, your relationship with your daughter is more important than business at the end of the day. She probably just wanted to be included and feel cared for by her mom. Wouldn\u2019t have killed you to do so.", "Yta... What you did was very detrimental to how your daughter sees herself and will feel inadequate... According to her own mother. My gawd,  big mistake I'm sorry.\nComing from someone who forever tried to get my mother's support and love and being good enough.", "YTA. YTA. YTA, Have you seen the recent trend in ads by fashion firms celebrating inclusitivity?  Have a look at these ads in which you could discover that a real professional can make everybody look great in their own way, also if they have scars or disabilities.  \n\n\nBeauty still is in the eyes of the beholder... It is more than skin deep. Try and learn to see the real beauty of your own daughter. Stop being so shallow.\n\nAlso, there was no need at all to speak so harsh to your daughter.", "YTA - you just should've used someone out of the family really... like a friend.. to avoid this... as a mother you should be the number 1 cheerleader and booster of your daughter...", "YTA. And not seeing why YTA confirms it.", "YTA for the way you answered your daughter. There was no need for that reply.", "Yta do you only want clients that look like your niece but not your daughter? I'm sure a 17 yo girl with a mother like you is already self conscious about the quality of her skin and the thickness of her eyebrows, your added commentary not necessary.", "YTA for not paying for an actual model and making this awkward for your family", "YTA!!! I guarantee that you deeply hurt and traumatized your daughter. She will never forget the person that should see her in the best light saw her as not enough. You easily could have done spa services for both girls and snapped a few pictures to avoid this.", "YTA\n\nYou do understand that those words are going to ring inside her head the rest of her life right?  How would you feel if someone you loved told you something similar.\n\nI don't know maybe--let's do a few months of treatments and maybe I can post before and after photos of you.  That idea never crossed your mind?", "YTA. This must not be real because there is no way you could not think this was a HUGE MASSIVE ASSHOLE move!", "YTA\n\nYour daughter will always remember what you said and how you made her feel. Do you understand that?\n\nYour parents at right. You either should have asked both girls or neither of them.", "YTA I would  not want to be one of your clients. If you talk about your daughter that away how do you talk about your customers behind their backs. \n\nIf your daughter tells people or posts on social media how you talk about her appearance your business will tank.", "TYA. And she doesn\u2019t think you called her ugly, you in fact did. Bad form, mom. \n\nAn alternative: \nSay your clients are mostly middle eastern.  \nOr \nUse both girls. Post before and afters of your work. You could have brought in new clients who have similar skin and hair/brows to your daughter. \n\nNot to mention the fact that you are a professional who offers facials and haven\u2019t stepped out of your judgement zone with your own child long enough to offer her support, encouragement and help with skin issues that likely make her feel awful.", "YTA\n\nCan you say anything nice about your daugther?", "Yta", "You're committing colorism on your own child.\n\nYTA\n\nThe good thing is that soon your daughter will be able to leave and live her life without you in it.", "Well you are the AH and you should never say that to anyone. You could have had a whole spa day for both of you and took photos and no ones feeling would be hurt or just not asked your niece.", "If there\u2019s one person you should be the most beautiful to it should be your mom, truly enough said. If objectively you didn\u2019t think your daughter should model you should have hired a professional not related model.", "YTA.", "At what point did we decide that we were going to drop the \"a\" from aesthetics? I see from the dictionary this a-free spelling is okay now, but...Was it just too hard to spell properly?\n\nAnyway, my god, YTA, and you are exactly why I don't take my daughter to \"salons\" for \"beauty treatments.\" Spend enough time around people who think body hair is a scourge and that your regular old skin isn't good enough, and your brain gets twisted in *ugly* ways.\n\nYou need to be clean. You need to brush and floss your teeth. You need to maintain your hair in a way that keeps it clean and healthy for your hair type. Everything else should be because of joy, because it makes you happy to adorn and decorate yourself. **A**estheticians like you do nothing but contribute to misery, not joy.\n\nOh, and for the record, if your 17 year old has plucked out her actual eyebrows and drawn new ones on, there two strong possibilities: One, you're not very good at your job and she doesn't know any better, or two, she has a form of OCD that makes her pull out her eyebrows and you never noticed.", "You might as well just say that you aren't very good at your job.

Wtf is wrong with you, bro-", "I don\u2019t think you are an AH for not using your daughter as a model. This is business. Snapping at her is not a good look though.

As an aesthetician, don't you understand how someone's perception of their own looks is an important to thing to manage, as well, let alone your own daughter's?  JFC\n\nYour daughter sucks at handling this poorly, as well, though, given your own poor handling of it, it's not surprising.", "ESH.  Look, I get the Y-T-A votes, but your daughter is seventeen and old enough not to know to push like she was.  She asked, you gave an answer that realistically, while maybe vague, does make sense: your niece is part Middle Eastern, and the bulk of your clients are Middle Eastern.  She then continued to push, and push, and push, refusing to accept an answer until you snapped and gave her the answer she was likely angling for anyway, even if she didn\u2019t really want to hear it.  If you\u2019re going to keep pushing and badgering people like that, then you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they snap, sorry.  \u201dAsk stupid questions\u201d as the saying goes, except she was asking them over, and over, and over.\n\nThat said, you\u2019re still the parent, and what you ended up saying was needlessly cruel.  You could have phrased it much better, though I understand you were frustrated by your daughter\u2019s continuing need to push the matter and her refusal to accept the answers she was given.\n\nYour parents also suck because I don\u2019t think their \u201dyou should have done both the girls or neither because it\u2019s not fair!!\u201d argument is valid.  Not everything in life is fair.  I\u2019m mixed-race and my cousins on one side are \u201cso white they don\u2019t even make foundation for skin as pale as mine,\u201d in the words of one of my cousins.  Sometimes things are different.  Your clients are mostly Middle Eastern women and your niece looks and is half-Middle Eastern.  I know a guy who launched a makeup startup for native women and was asked to model them at the very beginning before he could afford actual models, because I\u2019m indigenous myself.  My cousin didn\u2019t get mad about it, because the line is geared towards native women, and she\u2019s not native.  She understood that.\n\nAlso, if your daughter is genuinely refusing to take care of her skin (as opposed to simply having \u201dbad skin\u201d even though she tries), then that\u2019s the consequences of her own actions.  I\u2019m very sympathetic to people who just have problem skin through no fault of their own, but I\u2019m less sympathetic to people who have bad skin due to their own refusal to take care of it properly.  That\u2019s assuming what you said was true, of course.", "YTA, a year down the line, I won't be shocked to see a \"Why doesn't my daughter talk to me anymore\" post from you.", "NTA.

You came looking for validation and didn't receive it so you're arguing in the comments. Seems like a direct reflection on you if you're saying she doesn't take care of her skin.
