Wow what a violation. Then getting her people to message. Not safe people. Stand your ground. How scary actually. I\u2019d be livid.", "NTA. She used the keys without your consent and refused to give them back. Change the locks asap. I'm glad you pressed charges.", "According to your previous posts, I thought this sounded familiar, you got a major problem with all your family breaking in and holding your baby. You apparently leave baby home alone too.", "What? Fuck no NTA. Family or not you don't go in to someone else's house without permission especially in the middle of the night.", "Break in like picking a lock or break in like having a key. If it's the second one you most definitely need this key back.", ">Now my husband is back in town and we've both been receiving messages from my MIL's friends and family saying that we're being too harsh and that she was just trying to be a loving grandma.\n\nDid you call the cops and have her arrested?  No?  Then you were not too harsh.  NTA", "Oh, JFC, you put your MIL in the hospital for *stress* over this. I roll my eyes. \n\nDid she have a key? Change the locks. Did she *not* have a key? Get *better* locks-and *use* them.  And an alarm system, at least something that will alert if a door is open. Grandma *probably* won\u2019t be coming in the window\u2026\n\nProbably. Maybe you better get a whole house alarm, yea?\n\nBut, no, grandma can\u2019t break into your fucking house in the middle of the night to see the baby, or any other reason, either. Grandma is lucky she wasn\u2019t driven away by law enforcement.\n\nYea, you definitely need to set some boundaries, especially since grandmas little flying monkeys are telling you how awful you are. Those people need some serious time out. NTA", "Everyone saying that you\u2019re \u201coverreacting\u201d would react the exact same way of they were in your shoes. \nIt\u2019s easy to cast judgement when you\u2019re not the one waking up to a strange person in your house, holding your brand new baby. The fright you must have had! If it were me, it would\u2019ve aged me ten years and I probably would\u2019ve gone into flight/fight mode and started swinging. \nNTA and make sure that those coming at you are very clear on what exactly happened.", "She picked the lock to enter your home in the middle of the night??!!!! Is this her dry run practice for kidnapping?????\n\nNTA and whatever your bills are - report this woman to the police and find a way to increase security.", "NTA. Soooo NTA, I can't believe that's even in question here. That's breaking and entering, you could have easily called the cops on her and have her charged. It's not like she came round in the afternoon and asked to see the baby and you slammed the door in her face. SHE BROKE INTO YOUR HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. That's insane, and yes, a massive violation, not to mention scary. What would've happened if you hadn't seen her? Would she have kept breaking in each night to see the baby until you noticed? Who's to say she hasn't done it before? Do her friends and family not get how creepy this is? You not only need to seriously reinforce boundaries, but make it clear anything that happens like this in the future and you won't let her see the baby/you'll call the police. And maybe get a new security system. NTA OP. You yelled and asked her to leave, I would be pressing charges.", "NTA. Change the locks too.", "Troll!!! YTA", "Change the locks and get some cameras in the baby\u2019s room and on the front door. If this keeps going regardless, you\u2019ll need to call the police. She\u2019s creepy. NTA.", "NTA. Change the locks and install security cameras.", "NTA. There's this strange tendency to idolize anyone who calls themselves a mother... Mothers aren't lifetime titles. A person is in the condition of a mother while having a child dependent on care to survive. If her child is not dependent in some way, she should stop demanding special treatment for being a mother at one time. Right now, you are a mother and your mother-in-law is the person who gave birth to your husband, nothing more. The problem is if she still uses the \"I'm a mother and a grandmother\" card to override your \"I'm a mother\" title...", "Hold the phone - she came in, unannounced and uninvited, while you were sleeping ... and her friends and family are defending her??? I mean, you could legit file breaking and entering charges, endangerment... she broke several laws here. She'd be lucky to ever be in the same room as your child ever again! NTA - and your spouse needs to step up and tell their family that this is unacceptable and anyone voicing any support for MIL is on the \"no contact\" list with her", "NTA. Her being your MIL doesn't mean she can break into your home. That's creepy as fuck.", "NTA - who in hell breaks into their Son/DIL's house in the middle of the night to hold a child?  That alone lets you know she was in the wrong.  \n\nYou also need a serious upgrade in locks and security, and hubs needs to have a very serious talk with his overstepping mom.", "NTA that is super creepy to break in your house when you are sleeping. Aaaand you were getting to sleep with a young baby and she woke the baby to visit. Change locks or rekey them. She lost the right to a key. I\u2019m sure she told friends you just kicked her out during a visit not that she entered without permission or notice when you were asleep.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They're saying you were too harsh based on whatever lies your MIL told them. \n\nNTA.

Then ignore your husband's protests and follow through.", "Editing my post!!
