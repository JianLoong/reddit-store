He's trying to make you a little wifey just to stroke his ego and brag to his friends. \n\nYou need to learn to have an adult conversation instead of sending him away or running to mommy's house.

Why isn\u2019t your bf allowed to express a different opinion without you kicking him out of your bedroom or running away?", " I am going to do ESH but frankly your behavior is horrible OP\n\n\nGood lord you're both acting immature. He's excited to take care of you. He could have broached the subject with you in a better manner. And not whined when you flat out rejected what he was saying...better word choice/communication was needed there.\n\nBut you're the bugger ahole here. You seriously got upset and kicked your partner out of his bedroom because you disagrees with him and had a temper tantrum about it?? About him wanting to take care of you?? That's what is just too much for you and you flat out rejected him!?! Come on OP.\n\nHe then apologized and tried to approach you again and talk about it. You asked for honesty and because it wasn't what you wanted you got upset and RAN to you parents house to manipulate your boyfriend AGAIN.... Congrats...you got what you wanted. He won't bring it up with you again. He's just going to defer to whatever makes you happy and whatever you want.\n\nBeing an adult means having conversations about things like finance. And yes you may not always agree.... but you need to hear each other our and come up with a compromise or solution you both can live with. Crying foul and running to mom and dad as a manipulative tactic isn't that way to do that. FYI  most couples with income disparities actually DO split their finances differently from 50/50. Some will adjust the bills to based of their income percentages. Others will just cover more expenses or help with debt etc. The point is your boyfriend is serious about you and the relationship. And sees this as a chance to help provide some stability and comfort to you. It's what partners DO OP. If you needed a moment to think it through and discuss it with him.. you should have said that. \n\nYou can't kick him out and then in turn leave when he says or feels something you don't agree with. How childish of you.\n\nHow do you expect your relationship to survive OP?? Serious question....\n\nEdit to add... OP can be independent as she wants to be. But that doesn't give her the right to act the way she did. Be honest and communicate. If she truly feels that he isn't for her then you break up and leave the relationship. You don't trick people into answer and you certainly don't kick people out and run away when trying to discuss a topic. That's my issue here. She's going to get a ton of nt-a votes just because of what the title says. Either she will listen to those who actually gave critical life advice to her....or take the easy  votes and not even reflect back on the larger issues going on.", "YTA - Let him pay more.
