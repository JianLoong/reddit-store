So this is the price one pays for being disrespectful.  You did nothing wrong but give her back what she dished out for six yrs.", "NTA but only because it\u2019s self defence. You did try being civil, and unfortunately sometime we are forced into assholery to make a point. Walk it as far back as you can. Apologize, explain it was about you and not her.", "Sometimes people have to be out bullied to see themselves clearly? That's all that happened here. NTA. If you can dish it? Buckle up honey. Some people will ride you like a mule. Don't start no mess? Won't be no mess.", "NTA, you gave her SIX FUCKING YEARS to stop. Holy hell, you have the patience of a saint.", "NTA. I've always wondered why is it the people who dish it out can never take it? I would also hope that a person with body image issues would be sympathetic enough not to make fun of someone else's body.\n\nStill, you were a child being bullied, not just by an adult, but by a family member, and it seems like other family members were not defending you or getting her to stop. You had (and have) a right to defend yourself this woman's abuse. You tried for years to be polite, and for years it never worked. It's past time for you to try something different.\n\nI have to say - it sounds like your mother spent more energy getting you to stop commenting on your aunt than she did defending you from her bullying. I don't think much of her as a parent.", "This is a classic case of someone putting someone down to make themselves feel better. She shouldn\u2019t dish it if she can\u2019t take it. NTA", "NTA. She was trying to fat shame a child, it could have really destroyed your self esteem. Her body image issues are not your responsibility. As an adult with  body image issues she really should have know how it would have felt to you  to have negative comments made about your body and kept her mouth shut", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep defending yourself, - do EXACTLY this until she stops to abuse you.", "No, you're not the asshole. Where was the family concern when your Aunt started body shaming you at 12?", "You're NTA. Your aunt has body image issues and for some reason thought she should continually call a child fat? (I realize you're an adult now, but you've been asking her to stop since you were 12, so we can infer that it's been going on at least that long, if not longer.)\n\nShe deserved what you said. It's just a shame there was no parental intervention years ago.", "So it is ok for your aunt to bully you fromt he age of 12 about your weight  but not for you to try to shame her into stopping? And it seems she was just doing this to you because of her own insecurity. Her behaviour is not ok. You are NTA. It seems to have worked. But where was your family when she was calling you names?", "What you did wasn\u2019t exactly good, but I have to go with NTA. You\u2019ve been asking her for 6 years to stop calling you a rude name. That\u2019s a lot of patience. Only after you tried the nice route and it failed did you give her a taste of her own medicine. She was a bully (and an adult who was bullying a CHILD / now young adult) and she got what she deserved.\n\nAlso, where were these concerned relatives when your Aunt was fat-shaming /you/? Oh, that\u2019s right, they were laughing right along with her. What a bunch of hypocrites.", "NTA\n\nYou, as a child, were getting bullied by an adult. You fed her back her own medicine. I don't see a problem here", "NTA.", "NTA. You asked her to stop repeatedly. Now you're family knows not to fuck with you. Ideally you wouldn't have to do this, but given how they were all treating you, I think it was a good move. They thought you were an easy target, and now they know you will fight back. Don't do this in other environments, always wait to talk to people kindly first. But if you are getting bullied by a group it's okay to stand up and fight back after a while.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAuntie ignored your polite request so many times so your classy retort was perfect as it got the desired result.\n\nAsk those other people in what universe is it okay for an adult to continuosly bully a child?", "NTA - she doesn't get to break down over her own body issues and keep calling you gordita. Seems like it was an effective approach, and she's learned hurtful her actions can be.", "Esh", "Everyone sucks here.\n\nI probably wouldn't have commented on her weight even though she has been rude to you all those years. She was obviously projecting and has been extremely insecure.\nBut you stooping to her level wasn't sending the right message.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like it got the job done, she quit fat shaming you after you gave her a taste of her own medicine.

But in some specific cases, when a whole group is bullying, a person may need to fight back if they try everything else. She is a kid who can't avoid these people. She tried all the other avenues. She had zero support and everyone was piling on. People like that are looking for an easy target to make themselves feel powerful. She taught them that bullying her wouldn't make them feel powerful anymore. If she was an adult, I would say just avoid them and ESH. But as a kid she cannot avoid them. So in this case I truly think NTA. I don't know what you could possibly expect her to do. If she continued to take the abuse she would be an asshole to herself.", "OP is literally a kid.

How can you fill a child with such hate, and not expect to have it returned one day?", "[deleted]", "What's the position here, that children should learn to turn the other cheek towards abusive adults in their family?", "Oh please. Are you seriously going to argue that OP should be able to make disparaging comments towards her relative because her relative did the same? Precisely where does that get anyone? They're both assholes. Get over it.\n\nAnd again, what forum are you in?

Gordita translates to \u201c little fatty \u201c, but isn\u2019t it a super common name for little kids and sometimes partners in Spanish speaking countries.
