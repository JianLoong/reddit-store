Very early on I told her a couple of names I like but she obviously didn't like them and so I realized it would only lead to weirdness. My brother and I have nature names (think Ocean, Wren, Lark, Dove, Sky, Hawthorn, Ash) and we were named by our mom because dad was kind of unbothered when we came along. This time he's more involved. He and our stepmom have names like Elizabeth, Josephine, Emma, Emily, Joseph, Charles, William, etc on their list.\n\nStepmom keeps coming to us about the names, wanting our thoughts on what a good name for the baby would be. I'm honestly not into any of the names they like. I haven't said that. But it's getting harder to say no. I told her and my dad I didn't want to help choose a name and it should be for them. Dad figured out why but told me I should still be involved. My stepmom was upset and asked why I'm not more into this and naming siblings was a great experience in her family when she was young.\n\nDad told me I should be more invested and involved (he said the same to my brother) because our stepmom is trying and she'd be hurt if she realizes we don't like any of the names and we are trying to make her name their child like mom named us. I told him I don't think it will help when I like names like mine and my brother's name and they clearly like more regular names.\n\nMy stepmom sat me and my brother down and said it really hurt her that we don't want to help choose a name and she wants us to sit on it and consider whether we're being distant. My brother told her a couple of names he liked but while she really does try to hide it, she clearly doesn't like our taste, and I'd guess she doesn't like our names either.

He needs to get his wife to back off from you and stay in her lane. Yes it was important in her family for everyone to be involved but it's their baby and ultimately their choice in names. It's likely that he regrets not having input into your names. Well he's got his chance to name the do-over baby now!\n\nTell your dad and step mum that you guys will give your opinion once they've settled on their top three favourite names. But please stop pretending, she needs to know that you're not really into those classic names so it's pointless asking your opinion. Another thought is to let her know that you want to meet the baby first before deciding on a name. \n\nIf she still keeps carrying on then quietly little dad know that this kind of manipulation will only distance you both even further from him and that in two to three years he may not have either of you in his life if he and his wife carry on like this.", "No your NTA but I think it\u2019s time to just be honest to her maybe? Just say the names she picked aren\u2019t to your taste but are still lovely but you don\u2019t know what other ones she\u2019d like as they\u2019re not your style.

Tell him you understand that she is hormonal, and also very concerned about the whole family unit thing, but he needs to run interference for you.

It concerns me that neither your dad nor stepmom want to respect your wishes. You participated earlier but obviously she wants to go in another direction. That\u2019s okay!

My parents are divorced and everytime my dad got remarried and had kids it felt like he was creating a new family.", "NTA it\u2019s okay for you to have boundaries around this, and as much as it sucks it\u2019s pretty normal for your stepmom to want something from you that you can\u2019t give. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t make it easier. \n\nPregnancy hormones, blended family, grief and a 16/17 year age gap (once the baby comes) seems like an incredibly difficult situation for you all to navigate. I\u2019m so sorry this is a struggle for your family unit and your dad isn\u2019t being supportive of your boundaries or helping to negotiate a workaround. \n\nIt seems like it\u2019s going to be really important for your stepmom to realise that your family now might not mirror her family of origin in this respect, as much as she might want it to and it might be hard for her to accept that. \n\nHow would you feel about having a conversation with your stepmom and dad raising the example that you have given a couple of names and it made you uncomfortable or upset that she didn\u2019t like them? Helping your stepmom to understand why you don\u2019t want to, might make it easier for your stepmom to accept your boundaries. \n\nAt the heart of the issue it seems like your step mom is making bids for connection with you and your brother around strengthening your family unit and welcoming the new baby. It might be worth exploring as a family how to meet those needs for connection and welcoming the new baby in ways that you are all comfortable with?\n\nI hope you are able to resolve this gently, do you think your family would be open to working with a counsellor to develop some strategies around this stuff?", "NTA.

I like nature names but I went three times with classical names with Latin origin as this is MY background and are MY favorite (I carry for 40 weeks so yeah I got first choice) but doesn\u2019t mean I can not appreciate other choices.

Simone needs to just speak up and be like, \u201cWe did give some ideas. You don\u2019t like any of them. Why are we still doing this? We obviously have different taste in names. Just pick whatever you want.\u201d", "Your dad is directly contradicting himself - be invested in the name, but make sure you say you like the names SM is suggesting. Not possible - You can be invested and keep suggesting names you like, or NOT be invested and lie, say you like whatever boring name SM comes up with.\n\nHowever, you are upsetting a pregnant person and step-parent trying to bond with you, so ESH. Keep suggesting names you like, but give SM's names a chance. Also, pay careful attention to how it sounds with the last name and how the initials work.\n\nThey don't want you involved in picking a name; they want you to agree with them (or her).

She brought this on herself. Just don't break character and smile, or do anything to gove away that you're not serious. Dweezil, Bertram, Hoss, Jimbo, The Dude, Captain, or Dudley. Just a few starters to get those creative juices flowing.\n\nI named my kids kinda silly stuff, and they're just fine. If she has a moment of weirdness and picks one of your goofy names, it's not the end of the world.", "I think what she is desperately trying to do is include you and your brother. Less about the name, more about trying trying engage you. Tell her you want them to pick out a name they like. Then suggest maybe maybe helping to pick out nursery colors or theme. \n\nYou can also look at the names they like and pick  a couple that you find better than the rest. Even if the only difference is between an ugh and a meh. She\u2019s hormonal and trying, meet her half way.", "NTA.  DON'T DO IT!  If your stepmother and brother force you to give a name, your half sibling will have ID crisis in future.  Who knows they can be confuse and figure where they come from?! \n\nBoth stepmother and father must discuss themselves without you nor brother if you don't want to participate.", "NTA. I can understand why she\u2019s disappointed, but I think she\u2019s pushing a little too hard. It sounds like she was hoping this would be a fun bonding thing with you. But you all just have very different tastes in names. She\u2019s not probably not gonna pick anything you suggest, and you\u2019re not gonna have that big excited reaction to her suggestions that she seems to be looking for, so it\u2019s just getting awkward. \n\nMaybe you could try going at it a different way though? Like what if you get a whiteboard or a cork board with little pieces of paper and she can keep her list next to it and then each of you has a section on the board where you can rank your top 3 or 5 or however many names from just that list. Keep it in the kitchen or somewhere you all pass by often and can make changes when you have time, or do a little 5 min meeting once every week or so to sit down and eat snacks and compare lists and she can tell you if she\u2019s adding or eliminating names. Maybe that would help make it feel like everyone is more involved but take away some of the pressure and awkwardness of coming up with The Name and seeing peoples unfiltered reactions. Maybe you could put a little cup next to it for people to suggest names anonymously and she can review them privately and decide if she wants to add them to the list. I know your style is different, but try to think of it less of what you would name a kid if you had one and more \u201cI heard this name on a tv show yesterday and it sounds like something stepmom would like so I\u2019ll put it in the cup.\u201d It sounds like you all have good intentions. I think you can make this work if you get a little creative with it."]}
