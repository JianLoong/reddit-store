She should understand how much she hurt you and an apology would be the bare minimum from her side. You even seem open to forgive her if she would apologize, totally NTA.", "NTA You have a right to your feelings for as long as you need to feel them. She is a messed up person who is not much if a loss. But at some point, it may be time to give up.your right to be angry. That's what forgiveness is, giving up a right so that the anger doesn't eat away something in your soul. It will always be your right. Any time you need to feel it, you will be able to. But setting it aside is something you will do when you are ready, and not before. She has not repented. She has not changed her treatment of you. Apoligy is only a small.part of repentance anyway. The big part is repairing the harm and changing one's behavior. Maybe when she does that, you will be ready to set aside your right to be angry.", "NTA, but I think your letting your grandparents off easy, the forcing you to stay closeted was the most BS part of the story and they also played a big part in it.\n\nDid they ever apologize?", "NTA but auntie is.\n\nFamilies seem to think that folks should \"just get over it\" so they don't have to deal with confrontation or discord.  It is just sweeping things under the rug and does nothing for the proverbial \"family harmony.\"\n\nYou have the right to feel hurt and she is wrong for saying you're not allowed your feelings.", "NTA. You don't out anyone. You let them tell then in their own time and they tried to prevent you from telling them previously. They're gaslighting you, they're trying to play it casual when what they did was horrible.", "NTA- originally I was going to go with a ESH or soft YTA. Yes, you had to hide who you were and that was wrong, and your aunt took your moment to change that, it sucks. But at least from that point forward you could be open and honest with them and stop needing to hide it\u2026 crappy situation but net positive in the greater scheme. BUT\u2026 the way your aunt handled it when you expressed your feelings??? That is true AH behavior and makes me feel like this kind of behavior from her isn\u2019t a one time thing. In which case, she is toxic, you are not a AH and you have total right to hold that against her. Had she apologized and explained that she didn\u2019t realize what that moment would have meant to you, and you still held a grudge\u2026. Then the situation would be different.", "I'm sorry let me run over this one more time. So she outed you, acted upset when SHE confronted YOU about what SHE did, and then called you a slur? Does that sum it up?\n\nNTA", "NTA, Aunt is toxic be sure to out any toxic views she has to the appropriate parties.", "NTA. You have every right to come out when and how YOU want. I\u2019m really sorry she not only robbed you of that but laughing and calling you a slur after expressing your feelings? OP you are a much better person than I and I hope things get better for you. You deserve to live life openly and authentically you", "NTA\n\nThis would be the end of the relationship with aunt for me. I\u2019m sorry that she outed you, but I\u2019m more sorry that she was so flippant about it and completely dismissed your feelings when you raised it afterwards.\n\nYour niece and nephew are old enough that you can still be in their lives while having very little to do with their mother.", "NTA, but your family has always been homophobic. Kids are \"confronted\" with straight sex constantly, not to mention that it's fucking 2022 and they know gay people exist. Not to mention what she called you. You're better off not speaking to her anymore.", "NTA. Your feelings and responses can't be determined by what someone else wants. She laughed at you, called you immature, insulted you and then tried to turn other family members against you. Why would you want to have anything to do with someone like that?", "I've never been in your shoes, but my thoughts are this.\nIf you disagreed with their thoughts that kids don't need to be bothered with that stuff, it suggests you believe being gay is not a big deal ( I agree, it's not) why then did you feel like she took the right to tell them from you? If she did it in a casual non-judgmental nor demeaning way and you wanted them to know, I can't figure out why you're upset with her.\nAs for her later comments, when you told her why you'd been upset, I suppose that depends on your family dynamics.\nMy family uses dark humor , but we will tell each other if we cross a line and leave it at that. \nYou're entitled to feel how you felt about it, as long as you're being realistic about the situation and your response to it.\nGood luck, I hope you don't let this ruin your relationship with your niece and nephew.", "ESH? Them more than you. \n\nThem: It seems there's been no thought or foresight of the consequences of your upbringing and how that has affected you throughout your life and into adulthood. Also the laughing off the issue once you made it clear that it wasn't a joke, wasn't a small issue, and really hurt you is not cool. \n\nFor you: Absolutely makes sense and is valid to be angry. But oddly also there's still a relationship with your grandparents who demanded you hide your identity for years? It seems like some pent up anger at all of your family is being directed at your aunt and this singular incident. She outed you, wrongly, but it sounds like how you explained the incident it wasn't with malice or anything like that, she simply didn't realize it wasn't her place to do that. \n\nSome family dynamics can't be repaired, but in your aunt's case it doesn't seem like she was the primary catalyst for your identity suppression around your family *thought* (wrongly) in that moment, and when trying to give playful banter, that she was being supportive.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She wasn't the asshole for telling if she didn't know how much it meant to you to be able to tell them. They are her children (yes?) so she gets to tell them in a way that works for her. She was the asshole for forcing you to lie to her children all that time. Honestly, I don't think you're hurt because she told them. I think you're hurt because she dropped it in casually after making such a huge deal out of it for years. One minute she's \"don't tell my kids,\" and the next minute she tells them you like men as if it's not the big deal she's made it out to be. \n\nI think you should have called her out on it sooner instead of letting it fester. She might actually have done it that way because she'd been laying the foundation to tell them and this was a good time. She might have been trying to convey that your sexuality is so normal, it doesn't warrant a major conversation. It's impossible to say, of course, and if you'd called her out sooner, you'd know. \n\nOnce you did tell her how much she hurt you, she could easily have apologized and said she hadn't meant to hurt you. Instead she dismisses you. I would suggest that you write her letter explaining your feelings on that day, and about having to hide who you were from her kids, and about how little she seemed to care that she caused you such pain, and in fact dismissed it like it didn't matter. Basically a letter lets you say all you need to say without interruption and without forgetting anything. \n\n NTA. It takes a lot of courage to voice hurt, and to have it tossed back in your face just doubles down on the pain.", "If it was an honest mistake it would be different. The fact that she doubled down and insulted you after you opened up to her is the worse offense.\n\nIf she has apologized and said she didn't know it meant that much to you things would likely be forgiven already.", "I am very willing to move past this, as I do miss the relationship I had with her. But she didn't even apologise to me, she doesn't think what she did was wrong", "My grandparents NEVER apologise. Even if they are proven wrong, black on white, they will never admit fault. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love and adore my grandparents to bit, but it's they're one major flaw", "This.", "Wait, what?  OP\u2019s post makes it pretty clear they feel the opposite - that being forced to be closeted around his family was a big, hurtful thing, but he felt he didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter, since their guardians decreed the subject inappropriate and off limits.  He made sacrifices and hid part of who he was for the sake of avoiding conflict.", "I don't know why my grandparents made me hide it though. They're pretty religious, especially my grandfather, but other than the initial shock when I told them they have always been avidly supportive of me. My guess I that they acted on behalf of my aunt", "And you\u2019re NTA for your reaction.  I\u2019m very sorry that she did that and even more so that she doesn\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with it.\n\n*hugs* I hope the best for you.", "Which is why I don't understand why he is mad at her for \"outting\" him.\nWhen someone uses the word outed, to me, it signifies he did NOT want them to know. But I took his statement as he wanted the kids to know long before they did.", "So then what's the value of holding the grudge? They all made mistakes, it doesn't seem like they're necessarily unwilling to emoathize and take responsibility for the mistake. \n\nIt'd be one thing if this were another issue on top of a series of missteps and your family showed malice or a lack of support. But it seems like they're just a bit slow on progress and ultimately supportive. So how does holding that grudge serve you or them?", "You can\u2019t understand why it\u2019d be hurtful to spend years forced into the closet, only to have someone flippantly tell them oh yeah, you\u2019re gay?  Seriously?\n\nBeing outed is about having the choice of when, whether, and how to tell someone you\u2019re gay taken away from you.  Wanting them to know years ago in no way negates the hurt of that.\n\nOP has been hurt by his family for years, and the way his aunt just casually outed him is salt in a pretty deep wound.", "The aunt forced OP into the closet and closed communication regarding \"coming out\" to her kids. That's the problem at hand.\n\nThe aunt didn't come to them privately and said \"look due to recent media I feel they are old enough to understand what being \"gay\" is and I am okay with you talking to them about it.\"\n\nShe instead just casually said \"oh yeah  OP IS Gay isn't that neat\" without any communication to OP. So she forcefully outed OP (I forgot the pronoun so I apologize) without any form of communication.\n\nSo he was \"outed\"  because of lack of communication or permission for the aunt to tell the kids \"OP is gay\"\n\nHence why the word outed was used.", "Yes seriously. Like I get the whole aunt/ family being dick f*cks for not allowing the kids to know, things are not the same now as they were when the aunt or other older family members were growing up. I believe firmly that education on diversity, sex Ed, every single hot topic issue should be introduced in an age appropriate way when kids start school.\nI'm just not understanding the reason behind it as WRITTEN by the OP.\nIt's BS and effing sad AF that OP had to hide a part of themselves because someone else said so.\nYou say flipenlently, I say casually.\nThe end result is the same. The kids found out and they were unphased by it. Which I think we can collectively say is how most kids handle it now", "You\u2019re just purposely ignoring what the other person has been saying to you. No one has any right to tell people you are gay without your permission, especially when they\u2019re the ones who told you to hide it in the first place. OP was outed, meaning he wasn\u2019t the one who got to tell them the way he wanted, and he never gave his aunt permission to tell them. That\u2019s wrong no matter how you look at it. It doesn\u2019t matter if he wanted to tell them, it was supposed to be his decision of when and how.", "The same person who has been the driving force behind closeting OP is the same person who \u201ccasually\u201d revealed OP\u2019s sexuality, and you can\u2019t see why that would be terribly hurtful?\n\nWow.  That\u2019s a special level of obliviousness.\n\nAs a member of the LGBTQAI community, let me help you: it is ALWAYS wrong to out someone without their consent.  Always.  It is fucked up and selfish, and it disempowers them to choose when, whether, and how they open up.  It doesn\u2019t matter if they desperately want it known.  It\u2019s their thing to reveal in their own time and their own way.  You have never been there, so you do not understand, and you need to listen.  Can you at least try to imagine having someone blurting out an intimate secret that changes the way many people think about you and can endanger you would feel?  Even if the person they\u2019re telling is someone you would want to know and that you\u2019d be safe with, it\u2019s a bit like being pantsed.\n\nOuting someone is always a wrong and hurtful thing to do, but to do it when you have forced them to hide their sexuality for over a decade takes it to a whole other level.", "INFO: is calling someone a \u2018fag\u2019 offensive where you are?
