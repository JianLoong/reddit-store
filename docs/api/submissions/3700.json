I can\u2019t comment on if you had any opportunities to address her behaviour before it escalated like this. \n\nAs you\u2019ve all resigned, don\u2019t think she\u2019ll confront you about it.

Good call on leaving the situation - regardless of how it'll effect the company, a mass exodus of people she manages will certainly reflect on her.", "NTA\n\nThere's no point working for a manager like this and I think the best approach is to move on to something else.  Some might suggest to escalate to higher management but my experience of such situations is that senior management don't believe you, don't care or don't want to admit that they chose the wrong person for this management role.  They only take an interest if the staff turnover hurts the bottom line and their bonuses - but this realisation tends to come long after the damage is done.", "NTA\n\nGet you and your co workers to contact her boss about this. She shouldn\u2019t be able to get away with behaving this way.", "NTA but I would definitely bring this up to someone over her head if at all possible because not only is she being unprofessional about work by bringing her life situation into play when it shouldn't be, but she is missing important things that she really shouldn't be. She should not be a manager. I know that you're leaving, but if you have the spoons, talk to someone higher up the chain and at least make them aware of the situation.", "NTA. Report her to her boss and/or HR. She seems to be completely incompetent.", "You can bring this up at your exit interview if you have them.", "She is definitely TA, don't get me wrong - but I think you've all done a disservice to society by running away.\n\nIf you were all stable enough to be able to quit, you should have all filed formal grievances with HR and **her** manager, with details as above and more, and seen what they did. Worst case, you're out anyway - best case, *she* gets fired and you get a better manager/possibly her job.", "NTA. Hope your next boss is better.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
