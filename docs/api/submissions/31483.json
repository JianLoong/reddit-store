I believe those that felt shitty were reminded of the situation you\u2019ve been in (they\u2019ve been in for your Bday), and felt crappy about it, and somehow are blaming you, for their conscious bringing them down. Since you didn\u2019t paint it, and just said it plain, it\u2019s all on them. I should add, that I wonder how they would react had you painted it.", "NTA. Consequences of their actions hurt them?? Really? Who would have thought.", "NTA - I don\u2019t care if your birthdays were only one day apart, they both should have been celebrated properly. Parents who do stuff like this are just lazy. If two birthdays were genuinely too much, then they should have had a joint party in between yours and M\u2019s. Don\u2019t blame you at all for thinking they didn\u2019t care and they are delusional if they think you shouldn\u2019t feel this way.", "NTA It was true that they didn't care. They just don't want to be reminded of it so they don't have to feel bad even now. They don't want the carpet lifted to reveal all the forgotten birthdays that were swept underneath it. Nothing has changed. It's all about them. They should be ashamed. It's long overdue.", "NTA. Truth hurts sometimes.", "Nah you just laid the facts! Don\u2019t feel bad", "NTA. I was confused at first but I\u2019m gathering that A & M did not live with you. You just grew up really closely with them.You we\u2019re making it sound like you are the middle child.  It makes no sense for M\u2019s birthday to effect yours.", "NTA You simply told them the truth.", "No, you aren't! Your parents were giving the other kids special attention and were technically excluding you! (And yes, I do understand that A needs different attention because they're on the spectrum.) But on top of it, they got mad at you for pointing it out!", "NTA. They only feel guilty because they know it\u2019s true.", "NTA. The truth may hurt but it is, nontheless, the truth. If you don't want to be met with that kind of truth later on in life, I guess you should adapt your actions to that want at the present time. Later on, when the truth comes up, it will be too late.
