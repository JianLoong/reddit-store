A is also on the spectrum, so everyone has a soft spot for him, hence his demands would get fulfilled all the time. \r\n\nS\u2019s birthday is in June, and being the eldest kid, she naturally got away with a lot of demands and great birthdays when she was younger. A habit that continued well into adulthood.\r \n\nFor the first 7 years, I\u2019m sure even my birthdays were celebrated nicely. Then M was born, and her birthday was exactly one week before mine (in September). From then on, every year, S, A, and M would get their parties. M was the youngest kid so everyone doted on her and would throw a huge party. \r\n\nOn my birthday, my family would always be like, \u201cWe just had a party last week, let\u2019s go out in a couple of weeks for yours\u201d. Yeah, that never happened. This is not to say that I was ignored purposely or something. I would get a cake, my mom and aunt would cook special dishes that I liked, and it would be nice. But it used to be very different from the themed birthdays, fine dining, and amusement park birthdays that the other 3 got.\n\nThis went on till my 18th birthday because after that I moved away for my studies. Post that all my birthdays were celebrated drinking with college buddies, and now office colleagues. Nothing fancy, just a few drinks and some food to go. There was a phase of about 4 years when I didn\u2019t even cut a cake because no one gave me one. For me, my birthday is just another day, albeit with a little treat.\r\n\nThis year I planned to visit S, and so did my parents. My parents were happy to get to celebrate my birthday with them after 8 years. On that day, my father was feeling sick, and I called off the reservation for the restaurant that we\u2019d planned to go to. S had been very excited, and she was very pissed at me for doing that. We later did go to a dinner as my treat a couple of days later.\r\n\nLast week, I\u2019d gone home for Diwali (an Indian festival), and the topic came up. S was talking about our visit and the dinner thing came up. My BIL had undergone knee surgery at the time, and he\u2019d had restricted movement. Owing to that and the kids, S hadn\u2019t been out in months, and hence she was pissed at me. \r\n\nI told her that I figured that and that it was alright because we did go afterward. And we couldn\u2019t leave my dad sick. Also, I told her that my birthday was never a huge deal anyway so who cared? I joked a bit more and was laughing it off, but then my parents and my aunt got pissed at me. S later told me she understood, but that it was still a shitty thing to say that they didn\u2019t care. \r  \nI hadn\u2019t intended to hurt them, it just was something that I often felt.\r  \nSo AITA?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1700653227, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18177tp/aita_for_making_my_family_feel_bad_by_implying/", "score": 341, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Really? Who would have thought.", "NTA - I don\u2019t care if your birthdays were only one day apart, they both should have been celebrated properly. Parents who do stuff like this are just lazy. If two birthdays were genuinely too much, then they should have had a joint party in between yours and M\u2019s.

I had a friend birthday party, as did my sister and cousins, but I was never included in the summer party with all the family.

They don\u2019t like having it pointed out that they messed up and it\u2019s more about smoothing it over and acting like it didn\u2019t matter than just being transparent about it.  My mom once took my sister and I aside and said whatever happened when we were kids was done now and we shouldn\u2019t bring up negative things about it.

Comparison is the thief of joy...", "Ahhhh the consequences of their own actions making them upset in the future. Hmmm it's almost like they should have treated you better growing up. NTA but they sure are.\n\nTo resolve this tho if you have such interest, write a letter about how all of this felt, even use your Reddit post if you want, you got a lot of detail here already. But explain to them how it felt and that even if you've moved on from it, it doesn't mean it didn't happen. They did you a disservice and the least they could do is not guilt you over something *they did*. Frankly, Imo you're still owed an apology at the very least. Sure they didn't mean to do it. Doesn't mean they didn't do it. Doesn't mean they didn't make you feel less than on your birthday for over 10 years while your siblings got everything they wanted. Maybe if you explain they'll apologize and everyone can move forward knowing each other better, and that understanding will lead to a better future for all of you where you're closer for this knowledge.

My sister and I are 12 days apart. We generally had a joint family party in between our birthdays, but we each got our own party with our friends. It's so easily doable. My heart hurts for OP.

I just read the post about a dad who cheated with his wife's sister, and I really thought OP meant a blended family where one of his parents married one of his aunts/uncles.
