We have been to many gatherings at his sister\u2019s house for holidays, but frankly this year I feel fed up and don\u2019t wish to go.\n\nFor background, my husband is a pastry-chef-turned-super-accountant. His back was injured several years ago, rendering him unable to work in kitchens as he used to. His family will still ask him to bake desserts for family gatherings, but he simply can\u2019t handle it anymore. \n\nAlso, I had gastric bypass surgery (not the gastric sleeve, which is more common, but the RNY gastric bypass) about nine years ago. Since the surgery, I\u2019ve maintained a total weight loss of 180 pounds, and other issues related to my surgery have appeared in the years following. Most importantly for this story, I\u2019m hypoglycemic, which means I have low blood sugar and am sensitive to refined sugars. I\u2019ve been in the ER and had seizures due to extreme variations in my blood sugar, so I tend to avoid indulging too much.\n\nBasically, every time I\u2019m at his sister\u2019s house, they seem attentive to others\u2019 dietary issues, such as having allergen/gluten free options for a few other family members, but no diet sodas or low sugar drinks, and TONS of sweets.\n\nYes, I can bring my own drinks. I forget often while we\u2019re trying to get out the door for holidays, because I need to make sure that I also bring a few high-protein snacks in case the sweets outweigh the actual food.\n\nThis year, I asked what I should bring for thanksgiving, and I was told two desserts. I am the only person in the immediate and extended family to have blood sugar issues, and *I\u2019m* responsible for everyone\u2019s dessert?? I\u2019m frankly rather furious that I am being asked to spend so much time preparing dishes that I won\u2019t be able to enjoy much of, and when I mentioned that to my SIL, she basically said every other dish was spoken for and the desserts are my responsibility.\n\nI don\u2019t want to deprive everyone of desserts, so I am making a pumpkin pie with homemade vanilla whipped cream, and PB cup brownies. I\u2019m considering sending them along with my husband and just staying home for the day. \n\nWould I be TA if I stayed home?\n\nEdit(s):\n\n\u2022 No, I was not given \u201cfree reign\u201d to choose which desserts I bring, I was given specific items. \n\n\u2022 I was told to follow the recipes and not sub or use anything SF because another family member is sensitive to artificial sweeteners.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s not even necessarily about the desserts, but the fact that it will take time to make that I would rather spending making something I can actually enjoy.\n\n\u2022 Yes, I know water exists.", "created_utc": 1669267256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3b7yx/aita_for_wanting_to_forego_my_inlawss/", "score": 878, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just buy some pies at the supermarket. They don\u2019t deserve more than that.\n\nETA: I saw your comment that you were directed which dessert items to bring AND WERE GIVEN RECIPES.  What.the.fuck. Yeah, you should stay at home because that is some Grade A Bullshit. You are a hell of a lot nicer than I am because I would just bring a Costco pumpkin pie (which is freakin\u2019 delicious!) and consider it done.", "Nta but since it is your in-laws isn't the solution to tell your husband he has to cook two deserts.", "NTA.  Your SIL's family has made it pretty clear that they don't see or treat you as a member of the family who deserves to be taken into account.  Asking you to make desserts honestly sounds more like a deliberate slight than an \"oops.\"  I cannot begin to imagine asking someone who has severe sugar intolerance to make sugary desserts knowing they won't be able to eat them.  It's just CRUEL.  Add in the fact that all other dietary needs are accounted for but they don't bother to have options available for you when they know what your needs are--this is deliberate.\n\nTime to sit down with your husband, point out how unkindly you are being treated, and let him know that you're done.", "So they'll accommodate your MIL's \"sensitivity to artificial sweeteners\" but not your sensitivity to sugars, AND expect you to make two desserts you can't eat as a result of the command that you not make any substitutions in the recipes? NTA.\n\nIt sounds like they don't see your dietary restrictions as \"real\". I would be skeptical that there would be anything at all for you to eat there. Don't go, don't make the dessert. Let them supply their own, and enjoy a quiet Thanksgiving at home with your husband.", "NTA. They don\u2019t seem to care about your needs and feelings, so you don\u2019t have to care about theirs. Give hubby the desserts to take over there, while you enjoy your time at home.", "Screw these people; if they don\u2019t care about your health you don\u2019t need to be their caterer.", "NTA. Dude, don't make anything. People will get through this holiday without pie.", "NTA but you could take it as an opportunity to make sugar free desserts :-)", "I can\u2019t blame you for wanting to skip either. It\u2019s weird that they are considering everyone\u2019s needs but yours, right? \n\nHonestly, I know they assigned you specific desserts but I would show up with those *only* if the conversation went like this: \u201cHey, what can I bring? Do you need any help?\u201d \u201cOh yes, we need PB cups and pumpkin pie.\u201d Otherwise it seems rude to assign a guest to pay for and spend time making things they don\u2019t necessarily want to make. Now, if that IS how the conversation went down your hands are kind of tied, but I would honestly ALSO make and bring an additional dessert or two that you CAN enjoy. You said they like sweets, right? Is a couple of extra low-sugar or sugar-free desserts really going to piss everyone off? If the answer is yes, then NTA for peacing out on it altogether because\u2026 they\u2019ve seriously misplaced priorities.", "NTA. You're never obligated to go to events, especially if they don't respect your dietary needs. I've encountered sugar used in stuffing and gravy. What you're describing sounds tantamount to brittle diabetes, which can kill. If they don't respect your needs, I wouldn't go to any until they do, and just make sure to request SF alternatives. \n\nIf you choose to go, I'd make a special sugar free dessert just for yourself and pack a drink in your purse. But it may just not be worth it. If they don't respect that too much sugar can kill you, they don't respect you as a person. Some may just say, \"Nobody's forcing you to eat it,\" but they often don't realize ordinary carbs break down into sugar. It's not just about dessert.", "NTA. You\u2019re even willing to make desserts for them even if you dont attend which is a very kind thing to do. They should be accommodating to your dietary needs just like others with gluten/dairy allergies. \n\nHas your husband even spoken to them or asked them to consider your low blood sugar when planning?", "~~YTA for the odd way you're choosing to view this situation. I actually think they're doing you a FAVOR by assigning you to dessert.~~ This is virtually the only way you'd be able to guarantee that whatever is for dessert will be something that will fit into your dietary restrictions. By being in charge of dessert, you'd be guaranteed to have the ability to bring something that you know you'd enjoy, and wouldn't make you sick. \n\nI understand your feelings about the beverage situation, but I mean, there's gotta always be water there, right?\n\nEdit: After seeing OP's edit, I change my verdict to NTA. But honestly, if I were OP, I'd be petty af about the situation and just make the desserts with zero sugar, and if anyone complained, I'd just say straight-up that I couldn't make it with sugar because of my dietary restriction. Theu simply should have known better.", "Absolutely NTA. \nThey should respect and not just dismiss your health issues, anyone sane would totally understand your problems and help.\n\nAnd, have you talked to your husband about this ?", "As someone who regularly hosts, it's really weird that they asked you to make specific desserts with specific ingredients. If someone is going to contribute to a meal, it should be their choice, their own personal touch. \n\nAs someone who also has dietary restrictions, I never expect family meals to be catered to my needs, but that's because there are so many things I can't eat, and they are common ingredients, so I would rather not risk it so I bring my own food. \n\nHowever, it sounds like they cater to other people's dietary needs, but not yours? That's pretty hurtful.  So you can't enjoy the food, drinks, your own \"contribution\" s\\ or the company? I wouldn't blame you for skipping out on it. \n\nNTA", "Perhaps she is respecting your dietary restrictions by allowing you to make desserts you can determine the sugar levels of so you're not sitting staring at the desserts this year with envy.", "What dish would you prefer to bring?

It doesn\u2019t sound like SIL maliciously assigned you dessert. Do you have any low/no sugar recipes? Why not make one of the desserts without sugar so you can indulge? Sugar-free Jello recipes would be perfect for this. I think YWBTA if you stayed home out of anger.", "YTA. \"No sugar free drinks, I forget\" keep a pack of sugar free crystal lite in the car, a few tea bags, etc. Water is always available. Bring a dessert you can eat. A fruit platter and something else. You are the one sensitive to refined sugars, and don't want to overindulge, and too many sweets are common with these folks, so this is a win.", "Wait...so you were asked to bring deserts that you can make according to your dietary needs, and you're still complaining!?!?!? Your in-laws gave you the perfect opportunity to meet your own needs and they're obviously all willing to eat the same food that you would be ok to eat, how can you possibly be mad!?!?!\n\nAnd to say you \"could\" bring sugar free drinks but you are too much of a bad planner to actually do it?!!\n\nSounds like you're looking for a reason to be mad. YTA.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't be getting asked to make food you can't eat.  \n\nBut the WLS was a decision you made.  This isn't the case of an allergy or intolerance.  The low blood sugar is a side effect of a treatment you chose. \n\nYou know they don't have food you chose to eat.  Eat before you go or bring your own food.\n\nIt's the same advice I would give to a vegetarian/vegan.", "Why not make some sugar-free desserts that you can enjoy?", "ESH. Yes it\u2019s obnoxious they asked you to make the desserts but at the same time that gives you the ability to make whatever you want. Make something sugar free. The whole getting angry because they don\u2019t supply your diet soda? That\u2019s just silly and honestly not something I would think of either and my own mother has had the same surgery as you.", "Use a low glycemic sugar substitute (monk fruit for example) and make desserts you can enjoy!

You know desserts without refined sugar, or with minimal sugar, or with a high protein content to balance the sugar(pumpkin pie is a good pick as you can increase the egg ratio somewhat and have complete control over the type and amount of sweetener)\n\nEdit: changed judgement based on OP responses, they gave you a the recipes!!!!Hell no!", "If you stay home then YTA. If you go and have a shitty time with family like the rest of us, then you aren't.", "NAH. \nI had gastric bypass 14 yrs ago. It\u2019s been so long now a lot of people I know don\u2019t even know.

But I do avoid things-sugar, high fat meats. I often will bring an individual crystal lite if I don\u2019t feel like drinking water or iced tea,  when desserts are served I take just a tiny sliver and only have a bite or two.  If I want something specific that is sugar free I would make it and take it in addition to what they asked me to bring.   \n\nMy thanksgiving plate will be 1/4th the amount of food as everyone else\u2019s and will be mostly turkey and vegetables. No one ever notices, it\u2019s only a big deal if you make a production of it.  There will be so much food you can make a plate of what is best for you and it will be fine.  \n\nI feel like your post is less about them not caring about your dietary restrictions and more about you wanting something \u2026 I\u2019m just not sure what you want. You really don\u2019t require anything special like vegetarian or gluten free. Your restrictions are eating more often, smaller amounts, and limiting your sugar.
