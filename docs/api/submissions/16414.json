The three of them have always been apart of each other\u2019s lives, and they are very close. My husband and I (F30) have 2 children (F3 and F5), and his step brother has 2 children (F7 and F10). \n\nThe cousin is getting married, and when she announced her engagement, she invited my husband to be a groomsman in her wedding. The cousin then asked the step brother\u2019s daughter\u2019s to be in the wedding. She did not ask our children to be in the wedding. When I expressed my hurt feelings over this, I was told they only invited the older 2 girls because of their age, and my kids were just too young. I was not happy with this, but it\u2019s not my wedding, so I put my feelings aside. \n\nFast forward to the rehearsal dinner, and there are 8 other children aged 1 - 8, all in the wedding or invited to the wedding. These children are distant relations of the groom. My feelings are beyond hurt, to the point where I told my husband I don\u2019t want to go anymore. He told me I\u2019m being dramatic, and his whole family just keeps saying \u201cOh, it\u2019s so much more fun to not have your kids, you should be happy you get a night off.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s not how I feel, I love my kids, and this was a close knit family. I feel like they are being unfairly treated. AITA?\n\nETA: IMPORTANT: I do not care of my children are in the wedding party. If my post made it sound like that, I apologize.

I\u2019d go to the wedding but just distance urself from the cousin there after and more so come to a conclusion with your spouse as to why it bothers you . It\u2019d bother me more that he isn\u2019t as bothered lol", "*Note: I'm assuming that your kids were not invited as guests at all. If they were invited as guests, then you are TA.*\n\n\nNTA. For everybody saying that it's their wedding and they can invite who they want to, this is true. \n\nHOWEVER, they lied and told you it was due to age, when it was clearly not, and you were blindsided by the fact that your kids were singled out. If there were one or 2 kids who were obviously very close to the bride & groom there, that would be one thing, but 8 kids is a lot and it means that your kids were specifically excluded.", "INFO: might there perhaps be a behavioral reason they may not have wanted your kids there? 3 and 5 year olds are not bad but some have a very irrepressible energy.", "NTA, when did an invitation become an obligation??? Although a night out might be nice if affording a sitter isn't an issue.\nBut don't be petty, you would regret that.", "YTA. Not everything has to be so-called \u201cfair.\u201d You should just get a sitter, show up to the wedding, and enjoy a lovely child-free evening with your husband! Stop making it more than it is.", "Are your children invited as guests?", "NTA. F that! She wasn't even honest with you. \"Oh it's because of their age.\" Bull crap! I'd rather take my kids to the movies or have a special date night than placate that obvious diss.", "If there are indeed kids younger than yours and you were told the original reason was an age requirement, then NTA.\n\nIf you set an age requirement, then you stick to it completely.\n\nIf the reasons for not inviting someone is not age related then don't lie and say it is.", "NTA", "NTA. When someone makes a wedding child free, it is accepted that some parents won\u2019t come as a result. It seems like they made their wedding selectively child free, and instead of being upfront with you on why your children aren\u2019t invited when others are, their story keeps changing. \n\nSo if this were a child free wedding, you wouldn\u2019t be TA. I think their actions make you even less TA in this case.", "NTA. It's one thing for it to be a wedding that has NO young children invited, but it IS unfair to have yours excluded if there are other children of the same age attending. However, the inviting party of the wedding is ALSO entitled to invite anybody they like, and to NOT invite anybody they don't want. You would NOT be an AH to choose not to attend, but be aware it will cause issues with your partner. You WOULD be the AH however If you choose to make a huge spectacle of the issue, or if you attempt to diminish the event for other goers.", "NTA\n\nI was expecting to say \"nta, but it's their wedding; sometimes a couple will set a lower age limit; you're being dramatic\"... until I saw there were very young children at the rehearsal. Still nta of course, but you're not being dramatic. It does sound like your children are being deliberately excluded (UNLESS the rehearsal dinner somehow doesn't reflect the invite list for the actual ceremony?). \n\nThe family who are telling you \"it's more fun to go to a wedding without your kids\" are missing the point. You want your kids there, they aren't invited, and you suddenly discover the age limit was a lie. You have every right to be upset, even as the couple has the right to exclude anyone for any reason. \n\nWhat should you do? I'm honestly not sure. Ideally, you and your husband would respond as a team: either you both attend the wedding, or you both don't. I think, if he attends the wedding and you don't, it will reinforce the notion that you're just being sensitive-- because it will be very obvious that not only does your husband not agree with how you feel, he also believes you're being silly. \n\nIf your husband insists on attending the wedding... I'm not willing to tell you whether you should attend with him, or stay home. Yes, I know I said you and he should be a team, but that's the *ideal*. If it's not reality, then... I suppose it depends on the weight of your hurt vs your love and support of the couple.", "NTA, doesn't matter if your kids are involved or not,  cousin lied and it sounds like they don't even want your kids there. If it was me, I wouldn't attend, and I'd be making it clear to my partner that they can attend if they want, but it will cause issues in the relationship going forward if they choose a cousin over their own kids.", "Info- are you mad they\u2019re not invited or mad they\u2019re not IN the wedding? Because those are entirely different things, and so it\u2019s either a YTA or ESH. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to decide who is invited to someone else\u2019s wedding- you only get to decide to go or not go.", "INFO: were the kids attending the rehearsal actually invited to the wedding?", "I think your feelings are valid. I\u2019d be hurt too. I get if she only wanted older kids there. Makes total sense.\n\nBut to later realise there\u2019s actually kids your age there, it seemed a little strange. You\u2019re not the AH, but I can\u2019t say she is. I just understand why you\u2019d be hurt.", "Is the grooms family traveling from out of town?", "NTA. Your feelings are valid. On top of that, nobody needs a reason to not attend a wedding. \"I don't want to go\" is reason enough, and people should respect that.\nThe double standard is hurtful. Why should you be made to hang out with people that are going to treat you as less than?", "NAH\n\nHer wedding her decision.  \n\nYou can be hurt.  So long as you still go and don't complain to her, it's fine to be confused.  \n\nBut it's one day.  Weddings are minefields. Don't let this ruin your relationship.", "NTA. I would have understood if they only invited the step brothers kids because of age. There's a big difference between a 7 and 10 year old and a 3 and 5 year old. But the fact that they invited other children, some even younger than your own, I'd feel slighted too.\n\nHowever, you should still go to the wedding if you already RSVP'ed yes. Maybe try to figure out why they didn't invite your kids, there has to be a reason. Do you know for certain that the kids at the rehearsal dinner are also invited to the wedding? Could just be tagging along with their parents for the night and not actually going to the wedding.", "NTA\n\nThere is clearly an inconsistent set of rules here that are discriminating against your children. You should be pissed. So should your husband.", "Info how many of the kids were just invited to the wedding and not in the wedding party ? Were the other kids direct siblings to those in the wedding party?", "NTA. If it were me, I would try to remember that there could be things going on that I don\u2019t know about. Maybe you respected a boundary that the soon to be MIL stomped all over and invited children despite the couples wishes. Maybe someone on that side of the family just received a bad diagnosis, and this is the last chance to see all the kids. You just never know.", "Your title says they aren't invited but your whole post is complaining that they aren't in the actual wedding party. Either way, YTA. You get to control the guest list for your own wedding and no one else's. Go or don't go, but you don't get to cry that it's some kind of discrimination that the bride and groom are closer to other people's children.", "NTA for how you feel, that was a major d*** move on their part to pick and choose which children were included. If you are seeing that younger children are there, then it may be something specific about how your parent your kids (maybe you\u2019re more laid back than they are? This is a huge assumption though). \n\nDon\u2019t make a scene, you are going to end up making your husband\u2019s life more difficult by choosing this as the hill to die on. Just go, look at it as supporting your husband, and remember that it is only one night that is not about you or your kids. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair, I can empathize, but just accept this one crappy decision and don\u2019t drag your husband into the middle over it.", "YTA. Their wedding\u2026their rules. It\u2019s not your wedding! Get over yourself FFS", "NAH. It does seem unfair, however you don\u2019t really know the reason the bride and groom made this decision. Your husband believes you\u2019re being dramatic, however, and your kids will only care if you hype it up to them that they\u2019re missing out. So this is really on you to either simply let go or to allow some reasonable time and then express your hurt to the bride when you can be calm and willing to actually hear her side and seek to clear the air.\n\nAnd be honest, would you have made their wedding day all about your girls and how adorable they are etc etc? Maybe consider if your own tendencies may have contributed to this decision.", "YTA. There is no obligation to include groomsmen's children in the wedding. It's the bride and groom's choice. Either stay home with your kids and send your husband solo or find a sitter and keep your mouth shut.", "YTA, yes we all love our children,I promise you. If you can\u2019t have a fun night with your husband without your children there, you have a much bigger problem than this wedding.", "You're always free to RSVP \"no\" to a wedding but now that you've committed to going, you can't back out. YTA if you don't go.", "INFO: can we put aside bias here and think about what separates your children from others, perhaps their behaviour? maybe they\u2019re pussyfooting about your parenting\n\nthe other conclusion is that the groom\u2019s family was too pushy and the bride\u2019s side wasn\u2019t. do you really want to sink that low just because others did?", "Yta. You're seriously sulking and throwing a tantrum because your widdle feelings were hurt because your young children aren't in the wedding. Get over yourself and get over your sense of entitlement. It's not your wedding. The bride and groom make the rules and they have no obligation to include your kids.I hope you do boycott. Your husband will have more fun at his cousins wedding without you sulking and probably complaining all nite.", "YTA. This is not a \u201chill to die on\u201d. This isn\u2019t really that big a deal and should be a shoulder shrug situation. Also, you may not even know the real reason why the grooms side has children of that age there. Most likely they gave you the polite answer and there could be more to the story as in bride and groom probably had a fight about it themselves but in either case it\u2019s not your wedding and you don\u2019t get to choose the guest list.", "YTA. Grow up.", "ESH. It's not your wedding, so get over yourself. Same time, the double-standard is a dick move on her part.", "YTA. Stop taking someone else's wedding personally. The groom probably pushed for his relatives' inclusion and the bride caved, despite what she said to you. You are being dramatic, and unless there are particular circumstances about your children that would make the couple not want them at the wedding, you shouldn't be taking this so personally. I love my kids, too, but if a cousin didn't invite them to their wedding despite having other children there, it would be fine. People are not obligated to like your children as much as they like other people's.", "Your feelings are valid. But that doesn't mean it's ok to act on them. Soft YTA", "YTA. Your kids are young and they declared it child free minus those in the wedding. Your feelings may be hurt but honestly do the kids understand it ? You\u2019re the one being dramatic. Get a sitter and enjoy the night.", "YTA - it\u2019s perfectly legit to not want kids there, especially if they are certain ages and yes, if they are known to behave certain ways. \n\nCan you be sure those kids were actually going to the wedding and not just there Bc paying for two baby sitters is hard? \n\nAlso - kids wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. I think 99% of kids get bored after an hour \ud83d\ude02", "YTA over the reasons you specify.\n\nThere are a myriad of reasons why this cousin hasn't invited your kids to be part of the wedding party or to be at the wedding.  It's possible that they could be little brats... or some other reason.\n\nYou don't have to go.  It's not a summons and you can decline.  Your husband is going regardless.\n\nRealistically, where will you be sitting and how well do you know either side of the wedding couple?  Your husband will be up the front with duties to do as a groomsman so may not spend much time with you so I would hope you would be seated next to people you are likely to get on with.\n\nIf they don't know you, then you are an afterthought.  Is this how you've been treated by the family thus far?  If that's the case then you have deeper problems.  Your husband should be putting you and his kids first when it comes to the relationship with his family but if they are not including you including your husband then you may need to have a good long hard chat with him as to where both of you stand on this issue.  This bit  This may be standard treatment for you and kids to come.  You need to decide if you want to put up with it.\n\nBut if you do get along well then perhaps just enjoy the child free time that you have at the wedding.  Do you have parents or other family members/friends who would be happy to baby sit the kids for a few hours.  They'd enjoy the time with them much more than a 'boring' (to them) wedding.  You won't have to chase them and make sure they aren't causing trouble and also you won't have to console them when they are bored, cranky and crying (because they want to go home).", "Yta\u2026 it\u2019s their wedding, they can invite who they want. Maybe your kids are rowdy and you can\u2019t control them.", "ESH. You were definitely TA for asking them why your kids weren\u2019t included in the wedding party like your brother in law\u2019s kids. That was super awkward and poor judgment on your part. However, if they did indeed specifically exclude your children while inviting other similarly aged children they are absolutely TA for that. I would go to the wedding though, I think making this your hill to die on in an otherwise close relationship would be a mistake.", "INFO: Are you and your husband the same race/religon? This screams racism to me tbh\n\nEDIT: Stop fuckin' downvoting me, it was a shot in the dark. With the info I now have it seems most likely that OP's husband is responsible for this situation.", "YTA. Maybe your kids are more disruptive or they think they are for some reason.", "YTA. It's not your day. Get over it.", "NAH\n\nMaybe the person who is bankrolling the wedding insisted on these children to participate and then didn\u2019t want to pay extra for other children\n\nTry not to let it get to you. Think of it as their loss.", "ESH. Your children are awfully little to be wedding guests. Expecting them to be invited and part of the wedding is a bit much. That said, if other, younger kids are invited, that is definitely pointed at you. That is hurtful behavior. You aren't the AH for not going, you would be for causing a scene about who is invited to someone else's wedding.", "YTA for making this wedding about you. Why the fuck do your kids need to be in the wedding? \n\nIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s their aunt. It\u2019s a second cousin. You\u2019re being entitled and selfish.", "NAH, you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do, but I would choose not to make a big deal out of it. \nI do however think that you shouldnt take it to heart. If the didn\u2019t include your kids it\u2019s probably for a reason they don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing with you or they didn\u2019t want it to be a thing. Their unclear communication is there problem not yours, and again, you don\u2019t have to what you don\u2019t want to do. \n\nThey\u2019d also probably have a better time at their wedding if someone who was mad at them wasn\u2019t there tbh", "ESH\n\nHer - if you say no kids; there should be no kids at the wedding.  Not select kids, etc\u2026\n\nYou - you are making mountains out of mole\nHills.  You don\u2019t have to attend, if you dont feel like it.", "YTA\nSounds like you're reading way too much into this. If you get independent evidence in a variety of ways that these folks really don't feel close to you, either stretch out to bridge the gap or take that as a cue as to what you can expect in the future.", "YTA\n\nThey know the other children.

Sure, you are within your rights to not go or to be unhappy. I don\u2019t *actually* think she was dishonest in a sense that both your kids being too young and the others being invited can be both true at the same time. I think it\u2019s in bad faith that you assume dishonesty because when you think about it\u2026 It\u2019s not? Let me try to explain but first one clarification: were the bride\u2019s stepbrother\u2019s children invited as guests, or were they part of the wedding party? \n\nYou\u2019re a little unclear on that because it seems like they are part of the wedding *party* and you expressed your hurt feelings over your kids not being part of it. The reason for this was that they were too young\u2026 Which is entirely fair because as per all the comments, we understand that there are different rules for wedding parties and guests. \n\nAnd even if they were invited as guests, there\u2019s also the scenario where well. They\u2019re the bride\u2019s step-nieces and your own children are a little more removed from her side of the family. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to compare the two. \n\nAnd while the other children on the groom\u2019s side are \u201cdistant relations\u201d, some of them are part of the wedding party. Which is why please refer to my question in the linked comment. \n\nIf after all those considerations and you still think it\u2019s unfair then fine! Like I said, I understand you being mad that they\u2019re excluded. I\u2019m more questioning if there\u2019s actually any dishonesty involved or just things you didn\u2019t consider. Personally think it\u2019s a NAH here. \n\nYou can not go just as your husband and his family are more than fine to go.

I can do that without insulting people on stuff you have absolutely no idea about by claiming things that are so wrong that even stating Iron Man 2 was the best MCU movie ever seems like the most sane statement in the history of mankind :)   \n\n\nBut hey. I still wish you an awesome day and I hope you learn from this experience!", "Third paragraph of OP, 8 other kids aged 1-8 all distant relatives of groom.", "I\u2019ve never met the parents of feral little hellions admit their children act like feral little hellions. Denial is strong in those parents.", "Close enough for op to have her as a bridesmaid", "yeah i guess we are.\n\nwhen you are invited to someone's birthday party, do you automatically assume that means your kids are invited as well? i'm not trying to be rude, i'm seriously wondering.\n\ni mean, IMO it's one thing if a couple getting married chooses to invite the parents & all their children....but i find it odd that anyone would think an invite extended to them automatically means bring all your kids too.", "Agree with the other person that the invite says who is invited. Catering alone, even a buffet is going to cost $20-30 per person and that's fairly cheap. A plated dinner could run you closer to $100 or even more depending on the caterer/venue. Huge difference in cost between feeding John and Jane vs. John, Jane and their three kids multiplied across your entire guest list. So while it's obviously common for entire families to be invited, it's also not uncommon for kids to not be included. Different strokes for different folks.", "We can only go by the info provided. Not all kids are hellions", "Maybe it was as favour for her husband. \nAnd maybe the clossenes wasnt mutual.", "Maybe her mother is cat, either they're close enough\nThat she should consider if she wants to burn this bridge or they're not in which case why would the bride bother pay to feed and keep the kids of someone she's not close with at her wedding", "I mean maybe because op is contributing money including Paying the rehearsal dinner."]}
