Now usually I look after my nephew then because I work the dinner shift but I told my brother that I couldn\u2019t because I\u2019m going on my first ever date. He said no worries and wished me luck but his GF started freaking out at me. She said that they couldn\u2019t afford a baby sitter than and mum and dad are both working. \n\nI shrugged and said that it\u2019s not my kid to which my brother agreed, she said I was being an inconsiderate asshole.

After all, you do have a life too.", "I suppose it's better if fair warning can be given so they can make alternative plans, presumably this is impacting their jobs etc? Still, really what you've contributed should be considered a kindness and not an expectation. You did not have a child, and you should be free from the obligations that come with it. NTA, if anything it sounds like you have been a great in helping out. For contrast I have an 18 month old, and we've not had any help with care from relatives. No complaints, but what a thing it must be to be able to have some personal freedom occasionally thanks to help, ha.

Good luck on ur first date !", "NTA, but it's kind of you to try to be introspective and seek outside advice, and be considerate of your bro's gf.

In that case YTA for leaving them in the lurch with very little warning to find a replacement. \n\nIf it is a more casual arrangement where you don\u2019t do the same day and time every week then that would be different.", "Exactly. NTA. \n\nGF should consider that what you are doing in watching your nephew is a favor, not an obligation, and being rude and entitled could lose them your help entirely.

She is NOT entitled to free childcare. Yes having your typical childcare plans change is a pain but it's not impossible to work around as I have done before myself. What if you were sick, would she still send the kid to you.\n\nJust because she choose to have a child with your brother doesn't mean you are also on the hook.

You are absolutely right. I\u2019d make myself less available for babysitting after that because she is way too entitled.", "NTA\n\nYou gave notice and help out (unpaid?) frequently.

Which is NOT your problem", "Unless you actually promised to babysit on that specific day and backed out, NTA.", "NTA when a favour becomes expectation that is the time to stop doing it.

He had NOTHING to do with making said kid, and has been nice enough to watch the kid in his time off. Just because he has been doing it does NOT mean he owes them it. He has his own life to live and acting like it's putting them out to let him go on his first ever date? Not his kid. Not his problem.", "And? What's that got to do with OP?", "Maybe the brother does everything and she is just lazy \n\nYou don't know the situation and it makes no difference to OP they weren't the 16 year olds who decided to have a baby", "Plot twist: Future reddit posts will no longer include with phrase \"decided to\" have a baby."]}
