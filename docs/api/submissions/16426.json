So anyways, I\u2019m part of a writing group, and I asked out a girl I\u2019ve known for a while and she said yes she\u2019s a nurse so we both work weird hours. \n\nThe only time we were both free is on Monday so we\u2019re getting breakfast together then we\u2019re going to the movies.     Now usually I look after my nephew then because I work the dinner shift but I told my brother that I couldn\u2019t because I\u2019m going on my first ever date. He said no worries and wished me luck but his GF started freaking out at me. She said that they couldn\u2019t afford a baby sitter than and mum and dad are both working. \n\nI shrugged and said that it\u2019s not my kid to which my brother agreed, she said I was being an inconsiderate asshole.

I do understand babysitters can be expensive and hard to find, but at the same time he isn\u2019t my kid so I don\u2019t think it should be my responsibility to look after them.

Your brother\u2019s girlfriend does not. I would explain to her that if she continues to act this way, she\u2019ll need to find a baby sitter all the time.

And I think it\u2019s very kind of you for helping them out with free babysitting. The world needs more people like you!", "NTA. You still get to have a life outside your nephew and brother and his gf. They can find a babysitter for one day.", "NTA, she's expecting a bit much of you. After all, you do have a life too.", "I suppose it's better if fair warning can be given so they can make alternative plans, presumably this is impacting their jobs etc? Still, really what you've contributed should be considered a kindness and not an expectation. You did not have a child, and you should be free from the obligations that come with it. NTA, if anything it sounds like you have been a great in helping out. For contrast I have an 18 month old, and we've not had any help with care from relatives. No complaints, but what a thing it must be to be able to have some personal freedom occasionally thanks to help, ha.

Good luck on ur first date !", "NTA, but it's kind of you to try to be introspective and seek outside advice, and be considerate of your bro's gf.

No he isn\u2019t your kid but you did have an agreement to look after him. I would say your brother is also an AH for his attitude towards this, he\u2019s told you it\u2019s ok for you to ditch the babysitting but then hasn\u2019t thought about who is going to do it instead.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
