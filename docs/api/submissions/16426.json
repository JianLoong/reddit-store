You cant blame the blameless under the name of speculation.", ":)", "Responsible parents have alternates, and alternates to their alternates. If your childcare plan is \u201cdump kid on family members and get angry at the word no,\u201d you\u2019re a terrible parent and I don\u2019t feel bad for you.", "NTA. Sounds like the girlfriend is getting way too comfortable with the regular, unpaid babysitting. You do this as a nice favor for your brother- not because it\u2019s your responsibility.", "NTA. She is just trying to guilt you into behaving according to what she wants. One could argue it was inconsiderate to have a child without having the means to take care of it. \n\nYou are not responsible for other people. You do you, bruv.", "NTA, your brother sure knows how to pick em.", "at first, i thought he got a 16 year old pregnant and was really worried. \n\nanyways NTA, enjoy the date and if you're doing them a favor like this, they should be very nice to you. i don't know why they are being rude", "Why do they need a babysitter", "OP, you are definitely NOT the AH.  Honestly, though, I can understand your brother's gf freaking out.  It sounds like they have counted on you A LOT!  She probably panicked at the idea of that going away, thinking about the situation they'll be in if you have a significant other or move out and can't help them as much.  Hopefully she'll come to her senses and regret her behavior.\n\nGive her some time to get control of her feelings, then sit down with them both.  Explain that you love your nephew and are happy to be such a big part of his life, but you have your own life and you need to set up boundaries.  I would express to gf that your feelings are hurt that she doesn't think you should get to have plans that are important to you, that you feel taken for granted.  Tell them they NEED to have a backup childcare plan for when a family member isn't available.  And they need to ask if you're available EVERY time they want to leave their child with you, not just assume you're always on-call.\n\nNAH!\n\nHAVE FUN ON YOUR DATE!", "Boy do I have news for you about child care. \n\nSometimes they have illness outbreaks that require closure on short notice.   \nSometimes there are situations that make it unsafe for children to be there (like a burst pipe or no water).   \nSometimes they have staffing shortages.   \nSometimes there is inclement weather that causes a closure.   \n\n\nYou rarely get even 24 hours notice for those instances.   \nWelcome to being a parent. Have some alternative plans in mind.", "Shit take. Usually doesn\u2019t mean always. He\u2019s not locked into a contract.\n\nNTA", "Jesus dude. OP isn\u2019t some abused prisoner (to our knowledge); nothing in their post suggests that. I\u2019m sure they appreciate your concern and thoughtful plan, but take a chill pill.", "Why would grandma do that? Grandma is also not free, in built child care.", ">probably had no idea what all goes in to raising a child.\n\nSure. But I'm 14 and I'm *very well aware* that if I had a kid my life would be completely over. If they were stupid enough to keep, it's honestly a surprise that the kid hasn't died", "*he. OP is a man", "That's a nuclear option in a situation like this.  It's not that you should never do it, but you should be checking a whole bunch of boxes before going there.", "Not every thread needs a deep analysis. The question is if OP is the AH. That answer is clearly NTA.\n\nDon't need to get into the brother's psyche because there's clearly not enough info to draw these conclusions from.\n\nIn fact, if it were me being vindictive as I am, I would stop watching my nephew entirely until the SIL apologies for being an entitled AH. No one forced her to get pregnant, have a kid and not find a way to take care of her kid without relying on the generosity of family. But OP doesn't sound like the kind of person I am, so good on him either way!", "Massive assumption on your part. And even if that was the case, the solution is not for GF to go apeshit on OP.", "Especially with all the forced birth laws and attempts at limiting birth control options in some red states", "> I hate the \"don't have a kid in the first place\" attitude though the rest of the comment is correct. It's really not always that simple.\n\nContrary to popular belief, sex isn't needed to survive. Unless we're talking about a crime, no one is ever forced to have a kid because having a kid requires something that isn't needed to survive. It really is that simple.", "Especially since it sounds like OP must like his nephew if he's willing to watch him in his down time, it would be really damaging to his relationship with the little one to just fuckin leave him! This person you're responding to who can't even read the post thoroughly enough to know OPs gender doesn't understand basic human interaction, or the point of what you said at all.", "Welcome to being a parent. Guess you should have plans in place to cover situations where a usual caregiver might not be able to take your child. \n\nIf you can't figure out how to find childcare, I am quite concerned about your problem solving skills and ability to parent. \n\nThis is the job of the people that made the person. Not the random extra adult that happens to be in the house.", "I also wonder if some of the brother and gfs income goes to support the household. There\u2019s not much info here on financial arrangements. They could need to go to work to support the house that OP lives in.", "Happy Cake Day!", "lol? there are literally websites and apps for this", "Sex isn\u2019t needed to survive. And as an adult, you can recognize that and act accordingly with your fully developed brain. Teenagers are notoriously impulsive which is why abstinence-only sex ed is ineffective. Iirc the stricter a state was on abstinence curriculum the more teen pregnancies happened", "That makes sense. I guess at 5 the kid\u2019s not yet in school, hence why they need childcare during the day?", "One of my husband's friends does literally everything in his power to spend as little time with his family as possible. I'm not particularly fond of his wife because she tends to talk down to me and be rude to me, but I watch their dynamic and I just feel sad that she doesn't have a husband who wants to actually help her with their kids like a partner. \n\nGlad you and yours figured it out. Sometimes I think \"old fashioned man\" is a thinly veiled excuse for being lazy and disengaged from familial obligations not just household ones.", "Yeah and deciding to have an abortion will no longer be an option.", "Yeah, you have a good point there. I find it hard to believe they can't afford a babysitter for a one-off like this. And, like you say, I would find arranging one much more challenging.", "I never said abstinence only sex ed is how we should teach sex. But I'm saying that contraception can fail and having sex always comes with the risk of pregnancy. If you have sex with contraception, there is a chance of pregnancy. If you don't have sex, outside of assault, there's 0 chance of pregnancy. People claiming \"It's not as simple as not having a kid\" are literally suggesting that pregnancy was somehow forced upon them. That's just not true for the overwhelming majority of pregnancies.\n\nGuess what I also never did? Try recreational drugs. And thus, I did not develop a dependence on any recreational drug. It's pretty straightforward.", "yes, i agree. my opinion was meant to be as a last resort. in my experience with narcissists, they dont get the hint unless you go nuclear though\u2026 sad for the kid but ultimately thats on mom and dad who decided to have them.", "[removed]", "Semantics. I could say \"I wonder if the gf is so upset with OP because the real father of the child is OP, not the brother. I wonder if the child is an affair baby\" and I would be rightfully roasted. It's still just raising a possibility and these things do happen, but it's ridiculous to bring up because there is nothing in OP's post to suggest that is a possibility. Too often, people throw out random possibilities based on their own biases and experiences and it's really not helpful when it isn't related to the information given", "And do you spend a lot of time on AITA arguing with commenters for providing baseless speculation?    It's pretty frickin rampant on every single post so I don't exactly get the point of claiming it doesn't fit in the sub.    Maybe take it up with the mods.", "And so what? Her boyfriends brother is being kind of Enough to watch her kid free of charge. Regularly. It\u2019s his first date and that\u2019s a huge deal.\n\nIt\u2019s her child she can find other child care. It\u2019s her child and her responsibility.  If this is the way she is going to treat him. Acting up because one time he wants to do something else. She may have to find more childcare her self.", "I went through that with my cousin.   She seemed to think I was her built-in babysitter.  If I couldn't, she'd sometimes leave the kids alone. Ironically,  if anything happened to them alone in the house,  she would have tried to blame me!!! For some unknown reason,  nobody wants to bother with her now.", "Exactly.  You've been watching him for how long and she is used to it.  Doesn't mean you have to continue with the favor.  I understand you probably enjoy spending time with him but you are more than entitled to a life of your own.  All the best.", "Exactly - OP is NTA - GF is the parent and life isn't a free ride.  It is hard when you get a kid at 16 but guess what, you got a kid at 16 and you have them until 18.  Anything anyone does to help you is curtesy unless they are the other parent.   OP didn't have a kid at all and not even a date.  It's time for OP to live his life as he wants.  He owes GF nothing.", "This is the response I\u2019d expect from someone who had 4 kids before 23 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f either way, saying \u201cwell I wasn\u2019t like that as a teen mom\u201d shows a level of ignorance. Your individual experience doesn\u2019t mean anything in this conversation (no offense). \n\nHer attitude isn\u2019t the only issue. It\u2019s the fact she\u2019s desperate for OP to watch her kids because she neglected to have backup care set in place. That lack of preparation is very much a young mom thing.", "Yeah, same. You do everything you can for people, and when you stop because you just can\u2019t, they\u2019re angrier you stopped than they ever would have been if you refused initially.", "The brother was 16 and is 21 now. Unless she was 12 when she got pregnant, she's an adult.", "Yet he's also an adult who impregnated a teenager.\n\nThe GF is 16. *Sixteen!* She's a teenage girl who just had a baby. Yes, she shouldn't expect OP to babysit. Yes, she is being entitled. But she is also a child who is going through some major medical trauma and she needs support.", "Exactly. Ugh. Also, it\u2019s totally fair to wonder if that\u2019s the dynamic because we don\u2019t have the info and the couple is young.", "Yea! Unless it's rape, you choose to have sex without protection and not avoid this problem in the first place. Pretty simple in my opinion. \nAlso NTA, you are not required or obligated to watch the kid. Only the parents. Doesn't matter if it's family. Next  time tell her that she'll have to pay you if she throws a fit.", "\" my brother is 21 and got a girl pregnant at 16\" \n\nI read that as the nephew is now 5 years old because the brother knocked up his girl when HE was 16.", "I agree with his brother is probably happy for him. My one nephew was very over weight as a teenager and never felt comfortable asking girls out. Once he started working, he lost a lot of weight and was 21 when he finally got up enough courage to ask out a girl. His brothers, the whole family actually, were so happy for him. We would have moved the earth, changed any of plans of our own, whatever we had to do to make that date happen for him. So I'm guessing OP's brother probably feels the same way about him. And his gf is being selfish and entitled. I understand babysitters are expensive but you don't get mad and act entitled if this is the only day that works for OP and his date because of their own work schedules and he has been babysitting for you for free all this time. You appreciate the the time he gave you and figure something else out.", "I didn\u2019t mean to imply that you said that, rather that the method of abstinence-only for teenagers just statistically doesn\u2019t work out. \n\n>are literally suggesting that pregnancy was somehow forced on them \n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they\u2019re suggesting at all, I think they\u2019re just trying to explain that things as a whole aren\u2019t black-and-white. I feel like it\u2019s a bit of a leap to assume they think it was literally forced upon them \n\n>Guess what I also never did? Try recreational drugs. And thus, I did not develop a dependence on any recreational drug. It's pretty straightforward.\n\nAnd that\u2019s great for you! If it works well for you and causes no harm go for it. But there are billions of people on this world who are not you and that\u2019s perfectly okay too. Some people are able to moderate their illegal drug usage, others become addicts because their providers threw opiates at them. I just don\u2019t think such a staunch view takes into account the gray areas that many people fall into", "Yeah, I brought it up because this happens far too often in this sub. Ppl will often bring in these \u201cwhat ifs\u201d without anything to back it up and whether it\u2019s their intention or not it does affect the judgement of some ppl giving their AH opinions."]}
