Just bc brother agreed it\u2019s not OP\u2019s eternal responsibility to look after his nephew doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not worrying about getting someone else to babysit. He\u2019s just not acting entitled like his GF.", "That's some serious mindreading you're doing there, Uri Geller. No evidence whatsover that's actually the case, and an uncharitable assumption of bad faith.", "AITA users reaching to find a way to blame a man", ">If the brother isn't working while she is, but isn't watching their kid (which is not a likely scenario and not supported by the information given by the OP), then GF's beef is with her BF, not the OP.\n\nIt's more likely that the brother and girlfriend are both working, but that the girlfriend is the \"default\" parent, and that it will fall on her to either find a last minute babysitter or miss work. We don't know for certain what the situation is, but this is really not uncommon.", "They\u2019re all living together and he can stand his ground without escalating tension in their shared home.", "I do suppose that's fair.", "Not trying to be snarky at all, but what do you think the ideal response to this would be?", "Maybe next time OP should go with \"it wasn't my dick that came in you\" then.", "Kids are off-putting for a lot of people too, you know.", "Which country? Because there\u2019s a lot of them out there and there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019m not from the same one you are so that\u2019s a silly comment to make. \n\nAlso, first dates are for getting to know and spending quality one-on-one time with the person you want to date, not for spending a majority of it focused on childcare. Imagine going on a first date with someone you really like and want to learn more about but you can\u2019t have a conversation about something that isn\u2019t bluey or paw patrol because there\u2019s a 5 year old sitting next to you.", "brother is also probably trying to be a good brother here also. he's probably recognized OP's love life isn't moving forward and thinking that he needs pull a little weight to help the brother who's helping him.", "\u201cUri Geller\u201d genuine lol. Nicely done.", "Did you miss the \u201cI wonder\u201d portion of the comment? Because I didn\u2019t state that was the case.", "Nah, just floating a theory via \u201cI wonder\u201d. I didn\u2019t state it was fact.", "Except they DID decide to have the baby when they chose to keep the baby instead of getting an abortion or putting it up for adoption.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So maybe don\u2019t have kids you can\u2019t afford.", "He is not escalating tension. His brother's entilted girlfriend does.", "Who knows what an ideal response is?\n\nJust to be clear, my opinion of OP is NTA and he certainly deserves praise for what he\u2019s done for his brother and nephew. I just think he slammed the door a bit hard on his way out.\n\n\u201cNot my kid\u201d also sounds like \u201cnot my problem,\u201d which technically is true, but could be hurtful. Let\u2019s say OP\u2019s nephew was in the room and he heard those words coming out of his mouth. I\u2019m speculating, but from the perspective of damage control, such words have the potential to hurt the kid.\n\nSo OP definitely NTA, but his response could have been better. Getting a lot of heat from you guys here but I stand by it. NTA", "I'd say it's more accurate to say OPs brother recognises that OPs life is moving in a good way here for OP and he doesn't want to get in the way of that.\n\nIt's also fair to say he doesn't see OP as having any obligation to help him, he recognises that it's a favour and not something he can just demand."]}
