I will say though, that you\u2019re NTA for not giving him free support.

His parents are furious to see such things.", "so he disrespected them. how? that is important. INFO", "NTA this is your wife\u2019s brother and he wants you to give him money because she won\u2019t. No you don\u2019t do that. You support your wife\u2019s decision and back her by not giving him money.", "NTA. \nYour first loyalty is to your wife/kids. You are one unit. It\u2019s her family, and you need to follow her lead on this. Unless you have any major disagreements on this topic with your wife, there is no reason to deviate from this simple logic.\n\nDo you have an independent relationship with BIL?", "Nta \u2026. I think this has heavy influence of a culture that probably none of us understand but from reading the post my understanding is that\u2026.\nAs elders it\u2019s yours and your wife job to help financially support the younger members through education/ start of adult life but your brother in law cannot expect that support if he has disrespected the culture your wife and your mother in law (brought shame to the family) \nyou can\u2019t have your cake and eat it as we would say \nDo not feel guilt he has made his choices and now he has to live with the consequences hopefully both him and his wife are able bodied human that can both get full time jobs to support themselves or her family can support them as the approved and planned the wedding/marriage", "NTA\u2026why must anyone support a grown adult?

NTA.", "ESH Read carefully everyone. 23M is being threatened with being disowned if he doesn't leave his marriage. They are trying to bully him out of a marriage because they disagree with how it was done, and are claiming culture, and OP is on team bully. They then bailed him up in *hospital* and claim they were disrespected. I don't think 23M is the aggressor here. The nature of the disrespect is left vague. If seems multiple people in this scenario are well-off except 23M, and place a lot of weight in the funds they send around.\n\nI don't think OP is a reliable narrator here, he's with the family trying to push 23M out of a marriage and claiming non-specific disrespect.\n\nEDIT: Some of you are downvoting this, seriously!? OP's story is told from a sympathetic POV of the *aggressors* trying to exert control on and break up a marriage they don't approve of, and that's not even the whole thing. Scoundrels.", "Sounds like they ruined things for themselves \n\nNTA", "I appreciate your input. My wife and mother-in-law visited my brother-in-law while he was admitted to the hospital to offer him emotional support and provide him with money and food. However, he started to behave erratically and began relentlessly cursing them both. He even attempted to harm them in the hospital bed, but my wife\u2019s uncle stopped him. The reason for his outburst was that his parents had stopped providing him with financial support due to his marriage. My brother-in-law demanded that everyone accept his wife, who is two to three years older than him. He also wanted financial support from his parents to ensure he could continue living a comfortable life.", "He contacts me only when he needs money, such as for tours or license fees, and we don't have an independent relationship.", "Thank you for your input. I am clarifying something you mentioned. In our culture, parents are responsible for educating their children, not older siblings or in-laws. However, my father-in-law was determined to send him abroad for higher education. Unfortunately, he kept his marriage a secret for two years, and as a result, his father is now upset and wants nothing to do with him.", "Yes there is a whole lot missing here.  For reasons that are unclear, OP and his family disapproves of the marriage and is trying the bully BIL out of it.  BIL probably lost his cool once or twice and that is what OP is describing as disrespectful.  I think what it boils down to is that the BIL is trying to live his life in a manner that is contrary to many aspects of his culture, and the more conservative family members are opposed to it.", "I appreciate your concern. Even after knowing he was married and left out of the family, I continued to help him. During one of my visits to him, I suggested that being aggressive while talking to his family would not help him achieve anything. However, after the incident at the hospital, I didn't want to help him any further. Despite that, I sent him money on his birthday as a gift, although it wasn't enough to cover his bills.\n\nRegarding the pushing part you mentioned, I never said anything negative about his marriage. It's none of my business; I'm too busy with work and responsibilities.", "That's a 'no' then mate, especially if her content risks being demonetized because your culture feels it's inappropriate.", "NTA OP. Continue standing up for your wife and stick to your guns.

It could even be something so lopsided as not respecting their decision to force him to end his marriage.\n\nHaving said that I imagine I might get a little disrespectful if someone was trying to end my marriage too. ;)", "lol, I was at a \u201cthat\u2019s a no\u201d when I read \u201cvlog\u201d.\n\nOP, your BIL is doing grownup things like getting married. \n\nHe now needs to do grownup things like support himself. It seems apparent that he has no real plan other than demanding handouts from you. So unless you\u2019re interested in adopting a 23 year old bouncing baby boy (and his spouse) this is really unsustainable. \n\nAND to add to the mix, it seems he\u2019s deliberately trying to alienate the few family members trying to help him!\n\nHe sounds a treat, I must say.\n\nBIL appears spoiled and clueless.\n\nCutting off support is honestly the best thing for him. He needs to figure out how to adult and that\u2019s not going to happen while you\u2019re being his ATM. \n\nNTA.", "\u2b06\ufe0f"]}
