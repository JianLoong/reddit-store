{"id": 929, "submission_id": "ykdtzx", "title": "AITA for telling my husband what I think he should do with a car he inherited from a family member who passed?", "selftext": "My husband and I are in our late 40s and got married a little before covid. This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. \n\nOn with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don\u2019t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I\u2019ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). \n\nHere is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband\u2019s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. \n\nMy husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no car) He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he\u2019s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. \n\nI\u2019m stressed because he is basically telling me that he\u2019s going to do what he wants, and I don\u2019t get a say. Aren\u2019t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. \n\nHe even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m the asshole I get it. I\u2019ll stop bugging him about it", "created_utc": 1667415862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykdtzx/aita_for_telling_my_husband_what_i_think_he/", "score": 1202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband has the authority to decide what to do with the car, and he is under no obligation to listen to anything you have to say.\n\nThis is really not your business.

He is a step father he is not entitled to give your kids anything from his side of the family. Also I just bought a car, and the price for cars is extremely high right now. 4-5 thousands would get a very very poor car on this market, not a good starter car. I agree, with your husband he should do whatever he wants with his inheritance and you with yours.", "YTA. You want your kids to benefit and get $10,000. That\u2019s it. You are thinking only about yourself and your kids. If the roles were reversed, do you honestly think you\u2019d have the same idea you have now? That after only being married 4-5 years, your great-uncle meant so much to your new spouse\u2019s kids that they should get an equal inheritance? That\u2019s a bunch of crap and you know it. Quit thinking the world owes you something and think about other people for a change.", "YTA, he's right. It was his great uncle and his inheritance to do with what he pleases. You have no say in someone's inheritance, even if it is your spouse.", "YTA, the entitlement. So gross.\n\nYour kids should not be getting anything from their *stepfather's* inheritance. Yuck! \n\nYou just opened your husband's eyes though. Now he knows that he married someone very greedy and selfish.", "YTA \n\nYou and your kids have no claim to your husband's inheritance!

He can do with the car as he pleases, even if you don\u2019t agree with it. \n\nI\u2019m going to come at this from another angle as well. I\u2019m part of a blended family. My stepsisters grandmother passed away and left my stepsister something in the will. Her grandmother was close to my little one and me, but I never expected to be included in the will or have my daughter mentioned in the will. \n\nI could not even imagine expecting my stepsister give something she inherited because of \u201cfairness\u201d.  \nI\u2019d never expect it from my husband either. \n\nThe SUV was left to him, so it is his to do with as he wants.", "YTA and your husband is right; you have zero say in this matter.

I suggest you do your research before making such claims.", "YTA - it\u2019s his uncle and up to him to decide. You could make a suggestion, but. It\u2019s his choice.", "YTA. This is not something you both inherited, just your husband did. It\u2019s his choice how to handle the inheritance. You shouldn\u2019t expect, even if he sold it, that he\u2019d give money to you or your children unless you have previously agreed that should you inherit items that is how you will handle it. You have not been married long enough to just expect things will be split, let alone to children that are his stepchildren, from relatives that are not their relatives.", "YTA- What he said...it's his car to do what he wants with it.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why inheritances are not common marital property legally. \n\nSure, your logic is sound. But so is his. The only reason I\u2019m not going with N A H is because you\u2019re doubling down when it\u2019s an inheritance. He really does have not only the legal right to do what he wants, but when you consider that his uncle gifted this to him he has the moral right to honor his uncles wishes and do what he wants with it.", "OP, Question... Let's say your husband agrees with your idea.  Sells the vehicle and then, splits the money equally four ways.  Your stepson then gets a car with his portion.  During one of his stays at the house, you ask him to give his step siblings a ride or pick them up from a specific location, are you going to pay him out of their share for the service and/or the gas to do so?  I mean I think that would be the fair thing to do based on your post.  But I have a funny feeling your answer would be no. \n\nThe reality is HIS great uncle LEFT HIM an inheritance and he has every right to decide what to do with it.

Is he not deserving?", "YTA\n\nInheritance is not marital property, you have zero say in the matter and are acting entitled.", "YTA. \n\nIn a legal sense, inheritances are almost always not considered marital property. \n\nNow, yes, in a lot of cases, spouses will still come to an agreement between each other on what to do with the money, but your husband isn't being an asshole by not doing so here. It's HIS car that his great uncle wanted him to have, and his car to do with as he pleases. \n\nHis son is at the perfect age to get this car, it's a lovely way to keep the car in the family - the end. Your kids are not \"entitled\" to money from this car and to act like they do is absurd. \n\nHonestly, as long as his daughter is fine with it, that's the only other thing that matters. \n\nYou may well consider all of you to be a family, but you and your kids were not family to this great uncle. So yeah, your husband is right - this is his decision to make, not yours.", "YTA Inheritance is something you shouldn't mess with doing so can lead to serious resentment. At this point you've already tainted a gift from a deceased family member whom your husband must have had a decent relationship with to be included in the dispersement of property. It's probably very meaningful to your husband to be able to say \"Son, uncle was a great guy, you're a great guy. He'd love for you to have this. Keep up the hard work.\" The only party to be rightfully upset is sister, but maybe she loves her bro enough to be happy for them. Don't crap on your husband's memories.

I said nothing about the money, it was his. Husband decided on his own to take a portion of those funds to pay for the new carpeting in our house.\n\nI'm getting a much larger inheritance. Husband wants me to pay off the house with it. I said no....my inheritance is mine. I'm not soaking 100% of my funds into something that I might get 50% back on if we divorce (highly unlikely, but still). He didn't argue after I said no.  I did say I would pay off our cars and then we then put those car payments we would have been making toward the mortgage. He was happy with that.", "It is his inheritance, not yours.

That is your *husband\u2019s* inheritance. *His* uncle gave it to *him*. I inherited money when my dad died, and despite being married with a kid, it was *my* choice what to do with the money. I approached my husband about what to do with it and we decided what to do together because I chose that. If your husband wants to give the car to his son, that\u2019s his right.

This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. \n\nOn with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don\u2019t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I\u2019ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). \n\nHere is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband\u2019s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. \n\nMy husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no job). He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he\u2019s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. \n\nI\u2019m stressed because he is basically telling me that he\u2019s going to do what he wants, and I don\u2019t get a say. Aren\u2019t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. \n\nHe even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The daughter is an adult; she shouldn't be acting worse than I was when I was a kid.", "there will always be resentment between siblings no matter what measure you take", "No it\u2019s not, that\u2019s has nothing to do with the post or your judgement, she said is she the asshole cause she is trying to dictate what he does with his family\u2019s inheritance so yes she is for that whatever happens to insurance and shit has fuck all to do with it", "[removed]", "Oh I know. I don't think the step-children are entitled to it. I just think things should be fair between his daughter and son. If possible.", "Nope never felt entitled to anything. Still don't. Just didn't like being treated like I was less then, like I was constantly forgotten about, like I didn't exist. But when you have parents who aren't poor and just forget to buy groceries for their underaged daughter while they leave town for anywhere between 3-5 days of the week. And you live in a place where public transport is nonexistent and the closest grocery store is miles away. Having a car gets pretty damn important for survival. I walked to work and bought my own car when I could. There were times I went days without eating.", "won\u2019t he also support the son? of course, he will. so the inheritance should be divided between the daughter and the son.", "she\u2019s the eldest. being the eldest should mean not only additional duties, but also additional rights.\nwhat you\u2019re suggesting is not right, because when the son gets the same treatment the daughter gets AND the car on top of it, the daughter will question the logic. rightly so", "You are the one whining about not getting a car.", "No. I pointed out that unfair treatment sticks with you and can make you feel pretty fucking shitty and alone.", "Oh, whatever. This post is nothing about the daughter. It's about stepmother wanting money for her children.", "yeah, the daughter is thoroughly ignored. by her dad, stepmom and now you", "You've been beat up pretty conclusively that I assume you aren't even reading the last of the comments coming in.  That said, I think that most people are wrong here, or share a sentiment I cant comprehend.  EVERY time it comes to money - the rightful owner of that money has SOLE DISCRETION according to this sub. I genuinely can't wrap my head around it.\n\n\"My father is worth ten million - I asked him for $30K to finish my degree and he wanted me to sign a note promising repayment with interest and I said that's outrageous...AITA?\" Then six hundred comments confirming the father has zero obligation to give his child any help and she should quit being so ungrateful.\n\n\"My spouse, who I've pledged to live my life with, and grow a family with is excluding me from  having a say in a major financial decision which could benefit all of our family but is, instead, benefiting only his son...AITA?\" Six hundred more comments like the ones above.  Maybe they're all right, consensus seems to indicate as much, but as they say - \"the masses are asses\".\n\nIf i bring a human into this world and they are doing what they can to become the best person they can be, I'm going to help them if I can do so at reasonable cost to myself.  If I partner with another adult to raise a family, I'll certainly take their circumstances into account like I'd hope they would take mine into account when the shoe is on the other foot. That's exactly what a partnership is, agreeing to joining forces to lift both families up, not joining forces to lift both families up until I get a little extra that I can exclude you from.  I truly don't understand the selfish nature of people here. NTA", "Yta. He\u2019s right. Car was bequeathed to him. Not to you both. He gets to choose", "YTA. It's his car. Not yours.", "YTA,  if it was to sell the car for you and your husband to pay bills or something for pair of you I could agree.  But to sell the car to give the cash to all 4 kids (2 of which have nothing to do with dead uncle) you are acting like a bit of a horror, wind your moaning in and enjoy 16yo can chauffeur himself about, and maybe if you are nice to him he might help his step siblings by driving them about instead of you...", "YTA. \n\nLegally, inheritances are the ONE thing that is never considered family money in a divorce etc. \n\nMorally, grief is fucking weird. I'm willing to bet your husband feels some kind of way about letting that truck \"leave the family\". Let him be.", "ESH - Yeah it's his inheritance so demanding he seal and split the proceeds is a little bit AH. However, did no one spot that this guy has another child, a daughter at college. Gifting a 20k car to one child and nothing for the other is shitty.", "YTA.  \n\nInheritances are NOT joint property and he can do wtf he wants with it.  You have *zero* legal or moral input.\n\nWith the other kids resent him and his son for this choice?  Yes.", "YTA what makes you think you have a say in this situation", "Definetly YTA", "YTA. You and your kids are not entitled to hub\u2019s inheritance.  If the uncle wanted you or your kids to have something he would have left you something. Stop acting like you and your are owed anything. You are not.", "YTA. His family, his inheritance. This is a short term marriage and you already feel entitled.", "YTA. \n\nNot your blood relatives. It was gifted to him. You and your blood children did not have a relationship with this uncle. Literally, this car is a gift, most likely with the intention this was for your stepson already. YTA.", "We don\u2019t have the information to call the husband an AH over the split between his two kids. For all we know he bought her a 20K car when she was 16, and was always planning on doing the same for his son,  but this just saved him the expenditure and car shopping.", "And it\u2019s his bio son\u2019s granduncle\u2019s. If her husband was close enough to him I be in the will, I have to imagine his son was also in his life.", "Actually the only thing that worries me about this situation is how big the car is. Teenage drivers are teenage drivers and ive known a couple that have flipped cars like this after reaching for something or changing the radio station, they look up and are veering of course, over correct in a car with a high center of gravity and flip the whole thing.", "You can get some well maintained cars for a decent price from decent folks, like your mechanic.  I just bought a newer car for the kid so he'd have a warranty and something to drive that will see him through college or trade school or whatever he decides to do after high school"]}
