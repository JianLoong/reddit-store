{"id": 929, "submission_id": "ykdtzx", "title": "AITA for telling my husband what I think he should do with a car he inherited from a family member who passed?", "selftext": "My husband and I are in our late 40s and got married a little before covid. This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. \n\nOn with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don\u2019t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I\u2019ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). \n\nHere is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband\u2019s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. \n\nMy husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no car) He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he\u2019s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. \n\nI\u2019m stressed because he is basically telling me that he\u2019s going to do what he wants, and I don\u2019t get a say. Aren\u2019t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. \n\nHe even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m the asshole I get it. I\u2019ll stop bugging him about it", "created_utc": 1667415862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykdtzx/aita_for_telling_my_husband_what_i_think_he/", "score": 204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband has the authority to decide what to do with the car, and he is under no obligation to listen to anything you have to say.\n\nThis is really not your business.

He is a step father he is not entitled to give your kids anything from his side of the family. Also I just bought a car, and the price for cars is extremely high right now. 4-5 thousands would get a very very poor car on this market, not a good starter car. I agree, with your husband he should do whatever he wants with his inheritance and you with yours.", "YTA. You want your kids to benefit and get $10,000. That\u2019s it. You are thinking only about yourself and your kids. If the roles were reversed, do you honestly think you\u2019d have the same idea you have now? That after only being married 4-5 years, your great-uncle meant so much to your new spouse\u2019s kids that they should get an equal inheritance? That\u2019s a bunch of crap and you know it. Quit thinking the world owes you something and think about other people for a change.", "YTA, he's right. It was his great uncle and his inheritance to do with what he pleases. You have no say in someone's inheritance, even if it is your spouse.", "YTA, the entitlement. So gross.\n\nYour kids should not be getting anything from their *stepfather's* inheritance. Yuck! \n\nYou just opened your husband's eyes though. Now he knows that he married someone very greedy and selfish.", "YTA \n\nYou and your kids have no claim to your husband's inheritance!

He can do with the car as he pleases, even if you don\u2019t agree with it. \n\nI\u2019m going to come at this from another angle as well. I\u2019m part of a blended family. My stepsisters grandmother passed away and left my stepsister something in the will. Her grandmother was close to my little one and me, but I never expected to be included in the will or have my daughter mentioned in the will. \n\nI could not even imagine expecting my stepsister give something she inherited because of \u201cfairness\u201d.  \nI\u2019d never expect it from my husband either. \n\nThe SUV was left to him, so it is his to do with as he wants.", "YTA and your husband is right; you have zero say in this matter.

This is not something you both inherited, just your husband did. It\u2019s his choice how to handle the inheritance. You shouldn\u2019t expect, even if he sold it, that he\u2019d give money to you or your children unless you have previously agreed that should you inherit items that is how you will handle it. You have not been married long enough to just expect things will be split, let alone to children that are his stepchildren, from relatives that are not their relatives.", "YTA- What he said...it's his car to do what he wants with it.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why inheritances are not common marital property legally. \n\nSure, your logic is sound. But so is his. The only reason I\u2019m not going with N A H is because you\u2019re doubling down when it\u2019s an inheritance. He really does have not only the legal right to do what he wants, but when you consider that his uncle gifted this to him he has the moral right to honor his uncles wishes and do what he wants with it.", "OP, Question... Let's say your husband agrees with your idea.  Sells the vehicle and then, splits the money equally four ways.  Your stepson then gets a car with his portion.  During one of his stays at the house, you ask him to give his step siblings a ride or pick them up from a specific location, are you going to pay him out of their share for the service and/or the gas to do so?  I mean I think that would be the fair thing to do based on your post.  But I have a funny feeling your answer would be no. \n\nThe reality is HIS great uncle LEFT HIM an inheritance and he has every right to decide what to do with it.

Is he not deserving?", "YTA\n\nInheritance is not marital property, you have zero say in the matter and are acting entitled.", "YTA. \n\nIn a legal sense, inheritances are almost always not considered marital property. \n\nNow, yes, in a lot of cases, spouses will still come to an agreement between each other on what to do with the money, but your husband isn't being an asshole by not doing so here. It's HIS car that his great uncle wanted him to have, and his car to do with as he pleases. \n\nHis son is at the perfect age to get this car, it's a lovely way to keep the car in the family - the end. Your kids are not \"entitled\" to money from this car and to act like they do is absurd. \n\nHonestly, as long as his daughter is fine with it, that's the only other thing that matters. \n\nYou may well consider all of you to be a family, but you and your kids were not family to this great uncle. So yeah, your husband is right - this is his decision to make, not yours.", "YTA Inheritance is something you shouldn't mess with doing so can lead to serious resentment. At this point you've already tainted a gift from a deceased family member whom your husband must have had a decent relationship with to be included in the dispersement of property. It's probably very meaningful to your husband to be able to say \"Son, uncle was a great guy, you're a great guy. He'd love for you to have this. Keep up the hard work.\" The only party to be rightfully upset is sister, but maybe she loves her bro enough to be happy for them. Don't crap on your husband's memories.

I said nothing about the money, it was his. Husband decided on his own to take a portion of those funds to pay for the new carpeting in our house.\n\nI'm getting a much larger inheritance. Husband wants me to pay off the house with it. I said no....my inheritance is mine. I'm not soaking 100% of my funds into something that I might get 50% back on if we divorce (highly unlikely, but still). He didn't argue after I said no.  I did say I would pay off our cars and then we then put those car payments we would have been making toward the mortgage. He was happy with that.", "It is his inheritance, not yours.

That is your *husband\u2019s* inheritance. *His* uncle gave it to *him*. I inherited money when my dad died, and despite being married with a kid, it was *my* choice what to do with the money. I approached my husband about what to do with it and we decided what to do together because I chose that. If your husband wants to give the car to his son, that\u2019s his right.

This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. \n\nOn with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don\u2019t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I\u2019ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). \n\nHere is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband\u2019s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. \n\nMy husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no job). He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he\u2019s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. \n\nI\u2019m stressed because he is basically telling me that he\u2019s going to do what he wants, and I don\u2019t get a say. Aren\u2019t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. \n\nHe even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's your husbands decision and that's really the end of it, in regards to inheritance.", "A cheaper car that will cost loads in repairs down the line eh. Thats what happens. From what you said the car he inherited is lightly used so good condition yeah? Are you ganna fork over money for repairs should the cheaper car break down or is that up to stepson and husband?", "Are you going to pay for his cheaper cars repairs that will inevitably come up much sooner for what he can get for $5000, especially considering the used car market right now? Used cars are selling for much higher than usual. I can't imagine buying a $5000 car right now that won't need massive repairs within a year or two, unless he gets really lucky.", "Wait. Are you jealous of a 16-year-old?", "None of this is your business, and your children should not benefit (unless your husband\u2019s uncle wished that). \n\nYour children are not equal to his children in this scenario. You\u2019re really something thinking that they are.", "Yeah, but car prices for even used vehicles have gone up 40 - 60% over the last 12 months if not more than that. Better to have a 5 year old vehicle with a better safety rating than the kind of used vehicle that you could buy for $5k. Not only that, but I assume he is either on his dad or mom's insurance, so it will help keep their insurance costs low. Just from a practical standpoint, this is a good idea.", "ok so what\u2019s the issue here then? That your step-son who is able to drive & will prolly need a car eventually is getting the inherited vehicle? Like what\u2019re you gunna do if you split the money, eventually the son is going to need a car instead of being driven by every & any family member to get to work or something.", "So your children already benefit more than they should from this arrangement and you're trying to squeeze every last bit of blood out of him for your gain ultimately.", "Which he shouldn\u2019t even be spending more on your children than his in the first place. He spends more time and more money and now you want him yo share this as well? You\u2019re funny", "So by your logic you should be sending money to his kids in equal value to whatever you do with your kids yeah? You still haven\u2019t answered if you pay for his kids college tuition eh", "So how is that equal? \nYour saying that because your kids live with you and his don\u2019t you don\u2019t spend much money on them like he does on your kids which is due to circumstances and in your eyes fair.\nBut his kid is 16 and needs a car and as circumstances have it your children don\u2019t and are not yet of age to even have a car but those circumstances are unfair?", "True, i don't know anything about the market of cars right now. But i still think that buying a slightly less expensive car would help because i'm guessing at the moment the son does't have to pay any gas or insurance so when he's going to have to do that, having a little extra money from the sale of the more expensive car would help.\n\nFor the daughter, i wasn't implying giving her a car, but giving her part of the revenue from the sale.\n\nBut having had an issue with inherited car in my inner circle in the past, i know that it's hard to sell the car. He doesn't see it as a cash value, but like his uncle's car. If he doesn't sell it, his uncle is still a bit with them. So i guess i should resend my ESH judgement, but only if he talks to his daughter to make sure she won't get any wrong idea in him giving the whole inheritance to her brother", "[deleted]", "I really hope op\u2019s husband has a well.

Hybrid cars are high 30s to low 50s mostly, a few obviously do better than this. 1/2 ton trucks are mostly low 20s, good drivers can get mid 20s, 3/4 ton and 1 ton trucks are still around 7-10 mpg.
