You said it\u2019s physically making people ill. As someone who is sharing a living space with others, you should give consideration to the people you have to share a roof with. It\u2019s completely inconsiderate of her and unhealthy.", "NTA\n\nIf this is flat is through the university or private you might want to get the school housing or landlord involved as it might violate health codes.", "Certainly NTA.\n\nShe asked, you were being honest.", "NTA - I see you say in a comment that she is this way due to childhood trauma and depression, but also refuses to do anything about it as she says it her body and her choice. The fact is that trauma and depression can affect people this way, but it is her responsibility to work to get better. She needs to go to whatever counseling the college offers and try to find help and coping strategies.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t \u201cher body, her choice\u201d when it\u2019s negatively affecting others. It is making everyone around her physically ill and having a negative impact in the communal area. That isn\u2019t something that can continue to happen.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve done everything in your power to gently inform her of your concerns and she has either ignored it or doesn\u2019t realise the seriousness \n\nHave any of you met her family? Because at this point I\u2019d be trying to get someone she trusts to assess her and see if she possibly needs some medical help\n\nGood luck!", "NTA.  Can management have her evicted?  It would seem that if her hygiene is that bad, she would be better living alone and you all, and the neighbors would be better off as well.  I would consider it a health issue, perhaps that's an avenue you can explore for help if you haven't already.", "NTA, Hygiene is something personal but when it starts bothering others then it\u2019s time to do something, you have to be courteous to others unless you can\u2019t afford to shower then you have an issue .", "NTA. This doesn\u2019t even sound like a vanity issue so much as a serious health and even mental issue of this person who needs to see a doctor/therapist to get these issues worked out. \nDepending on how much you care or are involved with this person, you could offer to find her professional help, but certainly it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s anything else you can do. \n\nAge-old saying - you can lead a horse to water, but you can\u2019t make \u2018em drink.", "NTA. Hygiene in a communal area is imperative.", "NTA. It's a hazard to y'all at this point.", "NTA. If she really didn't know, someone had to tell her.", "INFO:\nI don't understand. Okay she can't shower but bathe ? Wash in a sink ? Use deodorant? \n\nThe smell being actually that bad is a full on health issue too. Are there other aspects in her life she has no hygiene? Serious question. Does she wash her hands after a poo?", "Nta... ew wtf", "Depends how you approached it\u2026I feel like there is clearly more going on here than just she\u2019s gross and won\u2019t change. For example is she depressed or something? I\u2019ve never heard of someone simply choosing to be so disgusting others vomit so I wonder if the kinder thing to do may have been to talk a bit more about what\u2019s going on than just tell her she can\u2019t be around you anymore", "NTA.   You were being honest.  She sounds like she needs to seek help, possible undiagnosed issues.", "NTA. If you guys are getting sick because of her terrible hygiene and isn't taking responsibility for it, why should you not tell her the truth?", "Yeah seems like a repost of something eerily very similar a few weeks back,", "Info: were you kind and compassionate or rude and blunt? There is a kind way to go about something like that. You don\u2019t know here history or background or the underlying reason as to why her hygiene is so lacking. If she is an otherwise nice and pleasant person, I hope you spared her feelings and embarrassment and showed her some empathy while telling her the truth.", "NTA. Ngl, I\u2019d be spraying her with Febreeze whether she likes it or not. Idgaf. If you\u2019re assaulting my olfactory senses, I\u2019m fighting back.

Not only is it unsanitary, but also really disrespectful of her. Gotta be honest when it comes to hygiene.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s harsh to hear but it\u2019s worse to always wonder what it is about you people don\u2019t like.  That can be emotionally damaging.  You did the right thing by being honest.  Perhaps maybe now she will do something about it.", "NTA.  Some people berated me on here b/c I had sided with a business owner keeping a homeless person out of their office building - But- I have worked at a coffee shop where several incidents happened where the odor of a homeless person made people physically ill, so I support the position that no one is obligated to hang around a person with an odor that sickening. It doesn't matter if the person is homeless or a roomate.", "NTA. And if everyone tells her \u201cstay tf away from me\u201d she might get the point. Or not. But let\u2019s be clear.

Tell them how it affects your mental health and your studies.", "NTA\n \nThis wasn\u2019t your first expression of a problem.  You provided her wirh hygiene products.  She is actively refusing (even if it is a mental health thing with her).  You\u2019ve been very kind and it is harming you to be near her.", "NTA, it's such a large problem it's making people physically ill and harming people in other flats as well. She knows it's a problem, she only came up to you because she's trying to make you guys feel bad and get back into proximity with her without her having to do the work she needs to do.\n\nY'all need to get aggressive and treat Her Like she's an enemy, because right now she is", "NTA how is she supposed to fix it if she doesn't know?", "I know what that smell is like i had a friend that stank so bad id make him take a shower when he came over not only that but if he sat in a chair and then left the room the chair would smell like rotting garbage", "It has also given myself sinus infections , when I asked her to sort it out , she said it\u2019s her body and her choice.

I think she might have special needs as well.", "Some Autistic people have difficulty with showers for sensory reasons, that's true. But if they can't figure out some other way to clean their bodies, the natural consequence is that nobody wants to be around them. There's gym wipes, there's sponge baths, there's bathtubs (if the flat has one and not just a shower stall). People in earlier times before hot running water and showers managed to keep clean; a daily sponge bath and clean underwear is more effective than most people would expect based on the \"daily shower\" norm. (Some historian tried it out.)\n\nWould the NHS provide occupational therapy to teach her a way to clean herself that won't trigger her traumas? Because it's not healthy to be that dirty, and it's going to limit her ability to get along in society if nobody can stand to be in the same room with her. \n\nI like showers most of the time--but certain types of shower sprays HURT. However, I also don't like being dirty, so I'd swap the showerhead in the flat with one I liked better. (I have sensory intolerances to unwashed human smells.)", "At some point, if it\u2019s causing you medical issues there has to be some sort of legal avenue for eviction. I\u2019d consult a lawyer.", "I don't know where in the world you live, but if it's America I highly recommend contacting your States APS ( Adult Protective Services) other countries may have it as well but idk. They will come do a check up on her, most likely make her get mental health help because it's sounds like she's got something going on in that head of hers.", "And it\u2019s your body and your choice not to spend any time with her. NTA", "What you need to do is treat her like an enemy. Because she's saying that she acknowledges that she is making you ill, and is willing to do so for her personal pleasure.\n\nShe is willing to harm you, she's an enemy", "Maybe write a letter to housing - all of you sign along with those neighbors affected by her smell - & request something to be done before health department/board gets involved as it\u2019s an unsafe living environment due to the smell & filth.", "Sounds like you may need to consider moving. I recommend that all your flat mates also try to move at the same time.", "That's really unfair to you, your flatmates and neighbors.  Will you be able to change flats at semester?", "Firstly NTA.\n\nIf you can, gently enquire about bathing or sink washing. Childhood trauma means no shower OK. I don't know if a childhood trauma could  mean no washing full stop.\n\nBut if she has no hygiene around periods & around defecating I'd be seriously worried about her handling any communal food areas etc. \n\nBut try not to assume & think worst of her. A \"whiff\" of dried period blood isn't evidence (Unless you are half bloodhound that is \ud83d\ude42) for the more serious hygiene problems, at least in my opinion. I'd suggest talking to her best you can... \n\nIt's likely she's in a really bad place and maybe you could help. But it is important to note that it is NOT your responsibility at all & if you go the route of getting her removed on safety grounds, then I still stick firmly to NTA", "This comment is cursed. Poor you.", "Ok I could be a bit sympathetic before I read this, but now no way. Period Blood or blood of any kind of a Health Hazard. I think you should honestly get legal advice at this point, do they have a free service at your Uni where you can ask someone questions? \nNobody under any circumstances should be in a position where it's a health Hazard. Please talk to someone legally, this woman is unhinged.", "You might try buying some boxes of those after gym body wipes (they're simlair to the ones people use when they can't bathe but don't have the stigma with a box that screams that),  use them some yourself and bring them up to her. Like hey you know showering is an issue for her but you just found these cool things your using when you don't have time to bathe. Offer to lend her the package.   I know you've tired a lot of things but while your working on finding a way to get her out and hopefully the help she needs maybe this will --- ease things?", "I think in that case NTA. As long as you approached it with kindness in mind and made it clear it\u2019s not her it\u2019s the hygiene piece, there isn\u2019t much else you can do", "She can't sponge bath on days she's feeling ok-ish?", "Then NTA. I work with adults with special needs and one thing we reinforce is natural consequences. You can choose not to bathe for whatever reason, but others can choose to not want to be around it.", "She doesn't like showers so have a bath then.

You all need to get really aggressive about getting her out of your space.

If housing refuses to sort the issue, you need to go above their heads.", "I third the health deparment and while it's a bit dramatic, what about posting on Twitter/Fb and any other social media and tagging the school/the housing department/the health department and any other department that is relevant? Maybe a DailyMail article coming out of that will force them to act?  \n\n\nObviously not naming your flatmate because it does sound like she is unwell but this is a biohazard at this point. I'm the type of person that walks past a butcher who isn't SPOTLESS clean and that mild meat smell makes me violently gag as I rush past it so I don't know how you've survived!", "Ugh! That\u2019s awful!", "Since you guys are students, I assume you aren\u2019t pushy enough, if at all. Email EVERYONE you possibly can. The university senate, president, psychological services etc etc etc. Oh, they will care", "Then go above them. Don't give up. You need to fight", "Ugh.  I am so sorry!  Good luck to you all!", "Yes bacteria can cause sinus infections, though it's uncommon. But things that smell bad, even if they are caused by bacteria, don't just float up into your nose and infect you. That's just not how it works. Sorry to be crass, but do you think smelling poop or farts increases your chances of getting a sinus infection? It does not. Would shoving it deep into your nose cause an infection? That could.", "I second the health department suggestion.", "Except we have zero idea what else she isn't taking care of and it is possible for people to grow mold on their bodies, as well as their living space. Which 100% can be causing problems", "Exactly so I think Mannzis should dial down their response just a tad!"]}
