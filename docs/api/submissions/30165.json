She probably spent her entire life surrounded by people who didn't treat her the best because of her height and she probably perceived your action as you infantilizing her instead of treating her like an adult. She didn't make a scene, she explained how she felt to the person who brought her there and removed herself from the situation, which is what a reasonable person does in my opinion.\n\nThese things just happen sometimes.

An honest mistake if you\u2019re not used to dealing with shorter people I guess. Imagine a person of average height doing that to a little person for the same reason. It\u2019s just something you don\u2019t do unless absolutely necessary.\n\nEdit: It also depends heavily on your body language.
