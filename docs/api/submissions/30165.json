Of course, some people just live to get offended, but I think this approach helps you sort those out.", "What?? NTA.  \n\nWho\u2019s going to keep asking someone to repeat themselves, when bending down solves the problem??", "NTA - As a hard of hearing person, I regularly lean in to hear and I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d. Like, if we can\u2019t hear, we can\u2019t hear. Background chatter is the absolute worst thing to hear over, even with hearing aids (especially with hearing aids, if I\u2019m honest!)  \n\n\nI think maybe she\u2019s insecure about her height and has read something into it that wasn\u2019t there.", "NTA\n\nMy guess is people aren\u2019t the nicest about her height and she is used to taking little things like that as an insult\n\nDon\u2019t take it personally, literally every tall person I know usually leans down first and it\u2019s the normal approach", "Baffled that anyone would think you\u2019re an AH for this.

I'll bet you do the exact, same thing without even thinking about it.  We all do.\n\nIn this case, you weren't belittling her size... you were simply closing the distance between you so you could both hear better.\n\nLooks like your sister's friend is a little over sensitive.

Like seriously, what\u2019s to be upset about?", "Genuine question: could squatting down be a better alternative?", "I'm 5 feet tall and this is making me laugh so hard!", "Maybe I wouldn't necessarily be upset but I certainly understand why someone might.  Most short folks I know usually fall into two categories, the type of people who are really self-conscious about their stature and the type who lean into it, embrace it and make a joke about it. We as people have no way of knowing how the person we're speaking to is going to feel about it.", "Sounds like your sister's friend is a bit.... short-tempered!   \nNTA, I also lean closer to hear people better.

If someone 6\u2019 and more bends over to talk to me that\u2019s better than me standing on a table to talk to them. I never noticed. My boyfriend is 6\u20194\u201d.

I hate the necessity for it. I hate how it makes me feel. I don't exactly like the other person for having to do it even if it's not their fault.\n\nBut you're not the AH it's just one of those things that short people dislike, probably because we get it all the time, so it feels like an over poked sore spot.", "NTA\nOne of my least favourite things in the world is to keep repeating myself to somebody who is making no effort to actually hear me.  Leaning down is actually a great way for you to hear something and to prevent people repeating themselves over and over. The friend /not friend of your sister has a complex about her height.", "Offense is taken, offense is not given. She is the type to take any reason to be offended.\n\nNTA, I am 5'4 and really appreciate when tall people lean down to speak with me. I have issues with background noises and need all the help you can give to not ask you to repeat yourself 5 times.", "NAH Obviously, you weren't trying to do anything wrong but think about it from her perspective. She probably spent her entire life surrounded by people who didn't treat her the best because of her height and she probably perceived your action as you infantilizing her instead of treating her like an adult. She didn't make a scene, she explained how she felt to the person who brought her there and removed herself from the situation, which is what a reasonable person does in my opinion.\n\nThese things just happen sometimes. Perfectly reasonable people sometimes bump heads and that's just a part of life.", "NTA, I have hearing difficulties and I lean in to listen to people often. Do not spend anymore time worrying about this one off situation.", "Lmao wtf no NTA", "I'm only 5'6\" but i absolutely duck my head to better hear someone shorter than me if needed.\n\nAnd then she went and cried to the bride over it?

It's unimaginable to me that this could be rude.", "i\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d and have lots of friends your height and i can barely imagine noticing, let alone CARING, that someone well over a foot taller than me leaned over to hear me! and especially in a loud environment?! come on NTA", "NTA. I'm 5'5 so not super short and he's 5'11, but when I first met my husband at a loud event, I was standing on my tip toes and he had to lean down and I was literally talking in his ear because it was so loud. And frankly, weddings can be so loud, I think you actually tried to be polite.   \n\n\nSome people are just annoying, don't even let it bother you. My dad is 6'1, 6'4 is tall, I'd be happy if you leaned down to talk to me so I don't have to yell at you and I'm a lot taller than her.", "NTA\n\nId honestly be thankful af u saved me from having to crane my neck at an uncomfortable angle just so we could talk.", "NTA. I'm 5'2\" and have tinnitus so I'm usually leaning in to hear anyways.

If it means you can hear me properly, who cares?", "NTA.\n\nWhat a stupid thing to get her panties in a twist over.", "NTA - she has serious self esteem issues", " NTA- I have no idea why she saw this as sexist.

Mild YTA. I'm 6'3\" and I know that much\n\n\nIn which world? \n\nThis is totally what anyone will do.

And before you ask picking them up or getting them a box to stand on is frowned upon as well.", "This one.  \n\nAnd any one can be a Ahole, shocking I know.  Entering some ones personal space is generally not a great idea", "Why? The rude behaviour already happend. What are you suggesting? Short people shouldn't talk to tall people?", "Yeah making the smaller person adjust is not good, but I sometimes see people squatting down for children, so I was wondering why that wouldn't be okay to do with smaller adults as well?", "The rude one was the short person", "Question is do smaller adults like being treated like childeren? I'm guessing no", "What for expecting to be treated the same as any other person? How dare she!", "\ud83e\udd26"]}
