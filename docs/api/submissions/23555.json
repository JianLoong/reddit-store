Parents always took her side, praised her, always compared her academic success to mine. Never looked well on my hobbies, sports and gaming, because \u2018there was no future\u2019 in it. Ironically, I have a successful career as a PT, and met my loving partner through a game con.\n\nJan always liked to insult my intelligence, how she was smarter despite being three years younger, and always got away with petty crimes. For example, stole my high school job money, and when I told the parents, they said I should share as she\u2019s too busy studying. It was textbook case of golden child versus black sheep.\n\nWhen I became sexually active, parents blew up at me. Things about how I was a pervert, how I need reflect and behave, shaming me for having thoughts and needs. Jan chimed in about how I was a \u2018man slut\u2019, and she could say no wrong. From them on, if they ever wanted to degrade me, they would call me \u2018man slut\u2019 in Chinese.\n\nThe kicker was when I found my current partner. We were both \u2018man sluts\u2019, shameful, disgraceful, perverts of the highest calibre. Jan added fuel to the fire about how perverted we were, that we were dirty, etc. \n\nI have moved out and no longer live with them. However, they want to maintain the appearance of a cohesive family, so I begrudgingly go to social family events with them, if only for the red money envelopes I get.\n\nEarlier this year, a friend sends me a link, asking if this was Jan. You can imagine what link it is. And yes, when I opened it, it was her, and being extremely sexual in the preview. I closed it, disgusted, but since I cut communications with her, I just left it be.\n\nThis Sunday, big family gathering. Relatives started asking about my love life, and I usually deflect or remain silent. Jan however, started going, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a manslut, he\u2019ll never settle down.\u201d \u201cGood luck to anyone who can handle his stupidity.\u201d It got to the point that even the relatives were visibly uncomfortable with her insults.\n\nI erupted. Said, \u201cAt least I wasn\u2019t showing off my body online.\u201d Told the relatives around me about the link I received, including the parents. I admit that my AH move was slut-shaming her in front of everyone, but I was livid, and just stomped out of the restaurant and drove home.\n\nPhone has blown up nonstop since. Took a call from mum, and she screamed at me, how dare I call my sister a pervert, how dare I shame her, it was all my fault. Dad is more reasonable, shocked at the news and asking how I knew. It\u2019s huge family drama. Some relatives I\u2019ve told about my past are sympathetic, but think I shouldn\u2019t have publically shared.\n\nI can\u2019t see Jan\u2019s reaction (she's blocked), but I did see from a friend that she basically broke down on Instagram about being called out and blamed a \u2018dumb dick\u2019 for revealing her private life.

I think it's justified given her behavior.", "Nta the videos are not private they \nare public", "NTA should of went all out with a PowerPoint presentation.", "Conflicted about this. Given your history with your family and that you post about it here (which indicates that you feel conflicted about doing what you did), I would say NTA. But you are also TA in this situation because you neglect and damage your own mental well-being by attending these events and maintaining contact with your parents. \n\nYou did what you did because a part of you felt justified to strike back against your abusers I think. But there lies the danger because striking back like this doesn't help you. It doesn't change their behavior towards you. Doing things like this don't make you feel better. It will just make it worse. \n\nYou need therapy (if you don't already have one) in order to work it out and learn to live with it. Because if you don't and if you continue doing things like this, there is a good chance of you becoming like your sister and like your parents. Neither you nor your partner deserve that. \n\nJust go no contact with your parents and with your sister because otherwise your mental health is just going to get worse. Don't attend those family things if they are there. No money in the world is worth endangering sour mental health. You can still see your other relatives but not if your parents and/or your sister are there.", "NTA. You were backed into a corner via years of family abuse and they're public videos.

I obviously can't endorse your sister's hypocrisy and ill treatment of you--or your mother's. I think you made two mistakes of poor planning. One, you didn't shut your parents and sister down earlier and in a way that imposed clear and foreseeable consequences. And two, you went into a trap you knew was going to be sprung on you eventually without a plan. I don't really understand why you'd even be in the same room as your family (fine, big family gathering) if you held that much contempt for them. I agree with your boyfriend.", "I'm going with NTA, and it's because there's a qualitative difference between your behavior and Jan's. Jan has always tried to make her position better by belittling you. Whether it was this episode, or some other instance of her hypocrisy, you'd have eventually blown up at her and shown her for what she is to the rest of the family.\n\nThere's a subtext of unnecessary shaming of sexual behavior that seems rampant in your family. That's unfortunate, but a common reality. In this case, Jan wanted to have her cake and eat it too. Could also be that by focussing the attention on you, she hoped to avoid detection and judgement for her own behavior. But . . . stones and glass houses, right?\n\nYour family needs a lot more help than they'll probably ever get. And those red envelopes? They're not worth your mental well-being.", "ESH. Slut shaming is terrible and two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, so you take a soft asshole for it. That said, you\u2019re no worse than the 4th ranked asshole in this tale and this smacks of bullies fucking around and finding out. I think you should strongly consider therapy to help address all the damage your fam has done to you.", "ESH. You all need therapy.", "NTA homophobe got outed as a sex worker to her homophobic parents. \n\nI'm playing the world's smallest violin rn.", "I actually really enjoy my relatives overall. I sometimes wonder why I wasn't part of their immediate family. So I go to the gatherings for them, mainly. The red envelopes average around $200 - 300, so while not a car, it's still a decent amount.", "Definitely not in the forseeable future, and most likely won't. I do like some of my relatives, so I'm thinking of seeing them separately.", "So the sister and the parents are not A H?", ">I think it's justified given her behavior.\n\nChange your verdict.  Per sub rules, justified assholes are NTA.", "I have been going, actually. It's given me a better view that mother enables Jan; my dad is also somewhat a victim. It's...a long process. Having been the black sheep for so long has done a lot of damage to me."]}
