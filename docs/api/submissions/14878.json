He is in a PhD program and I'm about to enter one. We don't want to wait to get married because of school (we'd have to wait about 5-7 years). \n\nHowever, neither of us are financially supported by our parents or family members. We can't afford a normal wedding let alone a big one. We would like our families to be able to come and celebrate with us. \n\nWe are planning a small court house wedding with only our immediate families in the room. Then we want to offer dinner at a local restaurant as a wedding \"reception\". However, venue and rental and hosting costs are too pricey for us. So we offered the idea to our families that we are getting married at X place on X date and will be dining at X restaurant. If they want to celebrate with us they will have to pay for their own meals at the restaurant (it's a family style sit down resturant so ~$12 average per entr\u00e9e).\n\nWe have gotten some backlash from family members who don't want to or can't afford to pay for travel to our town plus hotel plus dinner. They're saying we should be more traditional, should wait til we can afford a wedding before getting married, etc. \n\nEDIT: we are not asking for gifts (actually encouraging people don't bring gifts). We live out of town from family that is all spread out across the US and UK (we're planning to honeymoon in UK after school is over to visit that family). So there is no house or backyard option. We are going to either rent the restaurant space for a couple hours or rent a venue whichever seems like it will work best. There are of course no hard feelings or expectations if someone can't/doesn't want to attend. It's a very relaxed style get together/celebration. \"Reception\" seems to be too formal of a word. \n\nEDIT: we would like to avoid postponing the nuptials and celebration due to my desire for my grandparents to be able to attend as in a few years they might not be able to due to health or may not still be with us. \n\nAITA for not being able to afford to feed extended family and plus ones at my wedding reception and offered they come celebrate but pay their own way.", "created_utc": 1681585454, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nevpb/aita_for_asking_my_wedding_guests_to_pay_for/", "score": 1461, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The top y t a comments I saw are coming off extremely judgemental and calling you tacky and suggesting bbqs and crap (as if that doesn't also cost money and is a lot more work than going to a restaurant???). Nonsense. Even if it is \"tacky\", who cares? And I don't think it is.\n\nIt's your wedding.\n\nYou made the rules.\n\nYou communicated them and were up front about everything.\n\nMaybe the way you're doing things is different from others, but you don't need to shy away from that just because some people have their panties in a bunch. You're not being an asshole in any way.", "NTA. None of the people complaining here would be this upset if you were talking about a birthday celebration instead of a wedding. \"You shouldn't be asking other people to pay for your wedding!!!!\" Y'all are acting like they're setting up a GoFundMe or sending vendor invoices to their families. They're literally just saying \"Hey, we're getting married! After that, we're going out to eat at this restaurant. If you'd like to come celebrate with us, we would love to see you, but you will need to pay for your own meal.\" There's literally nothing wrong with that. They aren't asking for gifts or cash or someone to pay for a month long tropical honeymoon. \n\nSome of y'all clearly only go to weddings for the free food/booze and it shows.", "INFO: Will you be upset if people choose not to show up?", "NTA as long as you\u2019re up front about it and not also expecting gifts", "If your family wants a more \u201ctraditional\u201d wedding, the parents of the bride should pay for it. \n\nI\u2019m going against the grain here and saying NTA.  It\u2019s your wedding and reception, you should do as you wish. Just know that some people won\u2019t be able to go. \n\nYou could live stream the wedding for the family and friends that can\u2019t make it. They could still \u201ccelebrate\u201d from afar and still feel included.", "I went to 2 weddings last year, one dinner was paid, so i gave a gift of about equal value to the dinner, and the other i had to pay my dinner so they didn't get a gift.\n\nIt's not a big deal. Just dont expect gifts.\n\nNTA, if $12-30 is going to break their bank that much, they probably should stay home.", "You can ask, but they may not come. I personally think NTA, but I doubt I'll get much love for that on this sub.\n\nMaybe rent a gym and do a potluck? I've been to a potluck wedding before and it was fine. Weddings have traditionally only had lavish feasts in the last 50-60 years. More materialism now.", "So I think I\u2019m in the minority on this one. NTA. It sounds like you\u2019re primarily doing this so that family who wants to be there to celebrate has the opportunity to do so. If they don\u2019t want to come, they don\u2019t have to. Do your thing.", "NTA:  I don't see any difference between a modest restaurant party and a modest potluck reception.  Both scenarios have the guests paying for their own meals.  Both scenarios (likely) have the wedding couple reserving and paying for either a private room in a restaurant, a hall, or a park fee - possibly with a covered area.  \n\n\nThey essentially amount to very similar parties.  The hall or park would let you celebrate longer, but the restaurant offers standardized food with someone else taking care of cleanup.    \n\n\nOn a limited budget, there's a winning choice in here for anyone who doesn't want to blow a house downpayment or several years of college on a wedding.  People who want to support you will come.  People who have issues with your marriage or with optics... won't.   You'll know who your friends are.  \n\n\nCongratulations and best wishes going forward in the future!", "NTA \nOne of the best engagement celebrations I went to the guests all paid for themselves. \n\nOnly the people that really want to be there will attend rather than people just wanting free food and drink.\n\nCongratulations to you both,wishing you  gorgeous wedding celebrations.", "NTA. But then again, if getting married is so important to you, you should do it without family present. Get married anyway, they got the offer and declined.", "NTA,\n\nYou can't help being too young to have a big wedding financially.\n\nBut since I saw you write somewhere you don't expect gifts (even though people will be buying them). Why not tell people that as a gift you would love for them to come to dinner with you. That way you can have your reception, your dinner and instead of spending $50-$100 on a present the guests could spend it on their own food. \n\nJust a thought, hopefully you'll have a wonderful wedding either way!", "NTA. We did the same thing. We didn't ask any gifts, we didn't expect anyone to come. We did pay for the drinks and some appetizers at the reception. People were happy to attend, and those who wanted to stay for lunch after the reception paid for their own meal. \nEveryone was happy.", "I can tell I\u2019m going to be unpopular, but NTA. As long as you\u2019re not mad if someone doesn\u2019t come, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to have this kind of reception. If possible, it might be nice to have drinks or appetizers for the table that you pay for. But I don\u2019t think you have to wait until you can afford a traditional wedding. I would probably not call it a reception. My sister did this fifteen years ago and she asked us to all come celebrate if we were up for it. Only local people came. Yes, some were disappointed. But that\u2019s life.", "NTA. For a simple courthouse wedding I don\u2019t think this is wrong. They can skip it if it bothers them.", "Nta. This is coming from the point that you are actually being about the marriage not the wedding. If they\u2019re excited and happy AND want to be there, they can come! If not, you understand! But asking you to postpone your wedding until you can buy them a meal is completely unreasonable.", "against the popular opinion here, im going to go with \n\nNTA. \n\nwhy? because it\u2019s your wedding and it\u2019s your life. it\u2019s your happiness. if i was in this situation as your family member i would either come if i had the money or politely decline if i didn\u2019t and wish you the best in your marriage. it\u2019s as simple as that. you don\u2019t owe anyone anything. it\u2019s YOUR marriage. i personally think your parents suck. if you\u2019re in college and doing great, you love each other and you\u2019re really certain this is what you want out of life then they could at least offer some help. i would never let my kid go without assistance in their wedding especially if they\u2019re a full time college student. my therapist told me the best advice - don\u2019t live your life for anyone but yourself (i spent my entire first 22 years trying to always always always please my friends and family) i will spend the next 22 pleasing myself. i\u2019m now much happier. i advise you do the same.", "NTA", "Sometimes this wedding culture really surprises me. \nAll the OP and her fiance suggested is to come if you want to the place where they will be celebrating their small wedding. They just gave a chance of attendance to anyone who wanted it, and if not - no hard feelings. Cause otherwise there wouldn't be even a chance as they don't have money for traditional reception. \nIt's like a more polite way of elopement - we are getting married anyway, you can attend if you want to. \nNTA", "Nope. Nope. Nope. I was going to avoid YTA until that last para. Yikes. You\u2019re not \u201coffering\u201d anything.

Small courthouse wedding and those few guests that came to the courthouse with you go for cake and punch after.  No meal at all.  \nNTA for not being able to afford a normal wedding as they are expensive.  And NTA for being honest and saying we would love to have you but it is part your own way as we can't afford to feed everyone.  You are being honest and up front about it.", "NTA you told your friends and family where you were eating and said they could join if they wanted. You are not hosting a party. If people can\u2019t afford to come, you can tell them you appreciate their support and would be happy to have a drink next time they are in town. In would even have called it a reception. I think that\u2019s where people are fussed because they have their own expectations of what that entails.", "NTA so long as this is in place of wedding gifts, based on the UK subs it's pretty common to give enough money to cover your meal when attending a wedding here\n\nAlso you aren't demanding they come, if they can't afford to come they don't have to, just like you can't afford a big wedding so you're having a small one", "YTA. If you can\u2019t afford a wedding don\u2019t have one. Elope. Or do a potluck. But to ask guests to pay is not cool.", "Normally, I'd go Y T A, but I feel like NTA in this instance. My friend was having a large, traditional ceremony in a different country, but she invited me and a few other people to her courthouse wedding in our city. This was followed by a restaurant meal, and I felt like it made sense for each person to pay for their food under those circumstances. This was made clear well before the day of, and it just felt less like a party and more like a meal with friends, kind of like a birthday meal (the bride and groom paid for the wine and their own food).", "INFO: did you formally invite them to the reception or is this more of a \"hey we're basically eloping, but you're welcome to come party with us if you want\"?", "NTA. As long as you present the offer in a polite way and don\u2019t necessarily expect big gifts I think it\u2019s completely fine.", "NTA. If the want to come they should come and thats that.", "NTA we had a similar affair for our wedding (we had ours during lockdown, in the UK, 10 people total including ourselves) and had a sit down meal at a local restaurant, to which our family members paid for themselves and also paid for us... it feels weird to me that in other countries and families, its felt that the bride & groom should be paying for everyone, when in our family, it's the other family members \"treat\" the couple/person for the special event we're celebrating.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding, do what you want. \n\nIf people find it tacky, forget em.\n\nThese people are supposed to be here to celebrate you. I don't understand why everyone is so up in arms about you HAVING to foot the bill. If they don't want to go to your wedding to celebrate your union, then don't come.\n\nTo get up in arms over money is ridiculous. It's weird as hell that people would be offended when they know your situation. How are they family if they aren't even willing to try to understand your situation? Where's the love in all that?\n\nThe most ridiculous thing is they're up in arms over 12 dollars?!? What, are some of these people essentially homeless or something; to throw a dang fit over 12 dollars?!?!?!", "YTA\n\nIf you can't afford $12/plate come up with a different plan.

I would pay for my own meal to celebrate a family or friend\u2019s marriage.

People are really upset about this. I think NTA. What, only well off people can have a wedding celebration? OP isn\u2019t asking for anything extravagant and isn\u2019t expecting gifts.

My wife and I got married a year ago and did this. There were important aspects that we wanted and many of our family wanted a reception but didn\u2019t understand we didn\u2019t have the money for that. We compromised and had a wedding and had a reception at a restaurant and everyone took care of their own bills. We didn\u2019t expect gifts and we didn\u2019t get many and that\u2019s ok because that wasn\u2019t what it was about. \nYou do whatever makes you happy and whatever works in your budget.

Nobody is supposed to go bankrupt.", "My sister did this, had a courthouse wedding with just family, then lunch at a restaurant near by. NTA. do want you want to do and if others want to join then they can. Just don\u2019t call it a wedding or reception, because they\u2019re not. You can tell people you are eloping. If they ask about a reception you can tell people we aren\u2019t having a reception due to money but you are having lunch at X after going to the courthouse.

People will forget after 10 years or they\u2019ll pull a face that lets you know they don\u2019t see the marriage to last that long. Good way to weed out some less desirable peeps.

Potluck, BBQ, or something similar", "NTA!!! \nits your wedding and you decide how things go. youre not even forcing people to come and springing it on them that youre not paying. youre offering them to come celebrate afterwards(where dinner is about 12 dollars you said) and if they \u201ccant afford\u201d to pay for their own, at most, 20$ dinner then thats on them. you said that no one is financially helping yall with this wedding, but they also expect you to go all out so they can be apart of things. they were upset when your sister eloped, for financial reasons i assume? do whats best for you and the people who actually care about celebrating yall\u2019s newly wed life will pay for their meals without question.", "NTA. You get to have your wedding how you want. One suggestion for approaching it differently if you\u2019re looking for advice. You could request cash gifts in lieu of a registry, use that to pay for the meal, then probably have leftover to have some fun.", "NTA, my wedding was small with 12 people and then we went to a local bar and let people know they were welcome to come have a drink with us if they were so inclined. It was so much better than my first wedding where the bar bill alone was over $5k and people came just for free food and drink.

My parents wedding back in the 70s everyone brought something to share for their backyard wedding and they wouldn\u2019t change a thing.", "NTA as this does not sound like an actual reception more like a \"come watch us get married than have dinner with us' sort of thing.  If you were throwing an actual reception than you would be.", "I don't understand. Neither of you are financially supported by your families. Yet your families want to come to your wedding, and are perfectly willing to travel to do so. But, they won't incur the cost of dinner? It just doesn't make sense. Many, many people's parents/families pay for their weddings, they just aren't usually handed a bill \\*at\\* the reception dinner table. If they think it's tacky to ask all guests to pay their own way, but they want you to have a wedding reception and know you can't afford it, then someone in your family should step up and foot the bill, particularly for something as modest as dinner at a restaurant with $12 entrees! But if literally none of you--not you, your fianc\u00e9 or anyone in either of your families who is interested in attending--can actually afford to host a small dinner party, then don't have one?

I went to several where people used someone's living room or common room at their apartment complex (or went to a park), bought trays from the grocery store or Costco, replated items onto nice platters and serving dishes, borrowed nice table linens and silverware from their relatives and friends, and did a \"tea reception\" which consisted of sandwiches, crudites, maybe fruit skewers, and cake and punch. In fact, cake-and-punch receptions used to be a thing - there'd just be the wedding cake, some punch, maybe some coffee and cookies someone's mom or grandma made, and that's it. If you get married either in the early morning or in the early afternoon, you can get away with not having to feed people a meal and still have a nice, casual gathering. You don't need tons of flowers or decorations or favors, you don't need fancy tableware, you don't need a sit-down meal.

We wanted to get married, not have a wedding. \n\nSometimes there\u2019s no way to win.", "I think that\u2019s fine then. \u201cHey we\u2019re getting married casually at the courthouse then having dinner at this place after, come join us if you want\u201d is totally fair imo\n\nYou should definitely pay for your grandparents\u2019 meals tho.", "You are NTA. So many people here have a misconception of what a wedding is supposed to be - a celebration of your new union and love. It isn't a party where they are supposed to be catered to. Have a great wedding!", "I truly feel like I'm in an alternate universe where up is down and logic doesn't exist. You are NTA in any way. You aren't forcing anything from anyone. I can't even put into words how insane this sub makes me sometimes. Who are these people??? Lol.", "These are the kind of people you can\u2019t win with if you\u2019re not willing to throw an 80$ a plate reception. If you throw a small wedding, they\u2019ll be mad they didn\u2019t get invited. If you throw a big but stripped down wedding, they\u2019ll complain it\u2019s not fancy enough. If you elope and don\u2019t officially inform them in some way (by mail or in person, mass social media is obviously unacceptable to them) they\u2019ll complain you didn\u2019t tell them. If you do tell them, they\u2019ll say you just want gifts. If you literally tell them it\u2019s happening at the courthouse and they can come to Applebees after if they want and also no gifts, they still complain.", "No one's being forced to come. OP said they're not expecting gifts, buying your own meal is significantly cheaper than buying a gift. I think that's more than fair.\n\nAll these comments saying, \"I'm not getting a hotel room AND buying my own food!\" Lol, ok. Don't go then. You don't want to go to celebrate a wedding, you want to go play dress up and have a free feed. Where I'm from \u00a350 per head is the minimum you'd be expected to give as a wedding present and they're talking about $12 for an entr\u00e9e.

If I wear a guest attending I would recognise that these are the signs of a person financially struggling and go over and above with paying extra and giving a financial gift.\n\nThe idea that Wedding and receptions are only for the rich, or those capable of personally hosting a party is daft.

Things are much more expensive now than before. A dollar today has way less buying power than a dollar even 10 years ago did.", "But if family is coming from out of town, a potluck is an even bigger imposition IMO. Now they have to buy groceries and find someone\u2019s home they can prep it in Vs just spending the $12 \n\nOP - NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and your being upfront about expectations of the reception (and seem to have chosen a reasonably priced place). If you invited them and didn\u2019t tell them your guests up front that they are expected to pay, that would\u2019ve been the dick move.", "I personally love potluck receptions!", "Is it more inexpensive than $12?", "I think this is largely a regional thing. I live in the northeast and I\u2019ve never been invited to a potluck reception - it would be seen as incredibly tacky here. Plus that would piss me off way more than paying for my own dinner (something I also think is tacky because now I need to cook and transport). I also wouldn\u2019t want the liability of feeding my guests food that may have not been prepared and stored safely, etc.\n\nIf I were OP, I\u2019d do the courthouse wedding and ask people to feel free to stop by a local bar/pub to celebrate (while making it clear food/drinks won\u2019t be provided).", "Thank you! Thought I was going crazy reading some of these replies! Unless the B&G are paying for all the ingredients for their guests to contribute to a potluck, it still costs the guests money. And odds are the guests would bring a gift to a potluck. OP isn\u2019t asking for gifts. Cheaper for the guests to do it her way.", "Agreed! Plus I don't understand how a potluck isn't tacky but asking people to pay for a reasonably priced dinner in leue of a gift is. I also don't understand how the family says they can afford travel and hotel but somehow $20 on dinner and a drink puts them over thier budget. Especially, again, bc it's instead of a gift.", "Agreed, yet somehow \u201cpotluck\u201d is more socially acceptable? What a world.", "Some of the folks at my reception potluck are the same way, so they brought napkins, ice, plates, etc.  Lots of it came from a dollar store and worked just fine.", "A potluck dish costs me $15 (honestly, probably not even that much). \n\nA restaurant meal is $12/person. So minimum $24 for me and a plus one. Plus a tip. Hope you're drinking water and skipping desert.", "Why do they have to accommodate everyone for a day that\u2019s meant to be about them, the two people getting married. They already made concessions not eloping to appease parents. Why do they have to negotiate away from what would make them happy anymore than they have?", "Yeah it doesn't need to be fancy.  People will understand.  Hell, if you do a backyard BBQ or something you could even do music on a Bluetooth speaker.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the AH for not being able to afford it, but for thinking she can invite people and expect them to pay for their own meal.", "Did you already invite all of these people before talking to the restaurant? Logistically - your plan just might not be feasible for a restaurant. I would think they will want to charge you for an event or at minimum only charge one card for that many people. \n\nDoes the restaurant have a private event space? You say you can\u2019t afford more than 50 people. So you think it will work for you to show up with 45 people to this restaurant?", "Some places will not allow a large group to split tickets. You may want to look into that as well. Going to a restaurant really isn't a good idea in this situation.", "But 50 people is a (relatively) big wedding. Why not invite only the most important people, make it a small wedding and buy them dinner for a couple of hundred $? Or is that still too much? I get that you try to come up with a better plan than elope, so that you don't upset your family, but reality is that they get upset if you elope and they get upset if they have to travel and buy themselves dinner. You can't get it right for everyone, so choose the option that makes you two the happiest. Congrats!", "Simply curiosity. 50 people at $12 a plate is $600. If you can't afford that right now just do a courthouse wedding then have a fancy 5 year anniversary when you can afford to bring people in and celebrate it as if it was a wedding.", "Also want to point out that some courthouses have a limit as to how many guests you can have so you may want to check that out first.  By the way NTA I think asking people to bring a dish for a potluck is weird af and just asking people to come celebrate with you in lieu of gifts is appropriate.", "look, just do your thing. the people that will come are the ones who really care about sharing it with you. not getting a free meal. as a previous person said, those who argue over 20 for a meal, the meal isn't the problem, and neither is wanting to do things on your schedule. you have given people the option they don't have to accept.\n\nI got married at a registry office (a bit like justice of the peace wedding but for UK) and had a few people join us for a restaurant meal after and said \"we can't afford to pay for your meal but if you want to join us for a celebration lunch after, (as a reception as such) we would love for you to join  us.

I married the first time in 2000. The norm for a lot receptions was cake, punch, nuts, mints, and fruit & veggie trays. Have the wedding that you can afford. The people who support you will be there.", "I think you\u2019ve done the right thing. You\u2019re celebrating at a restaurant if anyone wants to join, but you\u2019re not hosting a wedding. People can choose whether or not they\u2019d like to attend. I would suggest making it clear you\u2019re not expecting gifts either. \n\nPersonally I would have zero issue with this. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what my friend did for her wedding a decade ago and I never even clocked it, I just flew in, stood for her, and paid my meal and drinks at the resto that evening. \n\nI think the framing is key here.", "Honestly it's refreshing to see a post from a bride that isn't \"AITA for demanding my bridesmaids all dye their hair platinum blonde and take 12 weeks of ballroom dancing classes?\". \n\nDo what makes you and your partner happy.

Fire ahead :)", "My husband best friend did a small nature ceremony and then a pub crawl. We were expected to purchase our own food and drinks and honestly, one of the best weddings I've been to.

They also didn't want gifts in exchange for people joining them out on the town.", "NTA you are completely reasonable and taking into account the previous complaints (with your sister elopement). Anyone who wants to come and can will come you gave them the option and let them know in advance.", "OP you are fine to do this NTA. You told every one up front they will pay their own way. Your problem is you came to the internet where most of the people here aren't married, haven't moved out of their parents basements and love being miserable to everyone.

They had a reception that had a bar.  \n\nIn our area it is tradition to have Jack and jills.  You have a party to raise money for the wedding.  We did this for tradition not because we needed it.  With the profits we had an open bar.  Right out of the gate guests were asking to be able to tip the bride and groom.  The bartenders put out a jar.  At the end of the night we had paid for our entire reception to our surprise.", "Are they expecting you to pay for their travel in 5 to 7 years? Or is it that they don't think you are worth the travel if it's not a big party? The reception isn't their issue. They want a return on their investment. Seeing you on your big day should be enough. You're plenty enough to the people who truly care. Have a great time. Your day, not theirs. And if you want a badass party later on, just renew your vows later, but remember who complained about this one. Karma's a B and it comes with compound interests. NTA \n\n\nCongrats!", "You\u2019re fine. If people want to celebrate with you they\u2019ll spend the $20. If they\u2019re bent out of shape about it, they can keep their asses home.\n\nYou\u2019re not inviting someone, demanding that they attend, and then springing them with a bill after they\u2019ve eaten dinner. people that love you and can afford it will be there and they won\u2019t be bitching about it.", "You have done the right thing, don\u2019t elope or avoid inviting people because of this, you are upfront, I would gladly pay dinner for myself to join a family/friend\u2019s wedding.

I eagerly pay $3,000 to watch you take your vows and then eat free rubber chicken.\n\nIt's really no different at all.", "It\u2019s more like, a chill dinner with the couple?  Shit, I\u2019d probably buy their meal as a gift. But I also don\u2019t want to split a tab with 20 of their friends and relatives. But then, I also wouldn\u2019t fly down for it. \n\nI think the sticky prt is if it\u2019s an \u201cinvitation\u201d. Like, I wouldn\u2019t send an invitation or make a verbal in visitation to an affair I couldn\u2019t cater, even just with apps or cake.

Then it\u2019s out of your hands and they get to feel generous or stay home.", "Absolutely, who says there are rules to a wedding? They are young, in love, and they want to do it now despite their financial difficulties because they want their grandparents to attend while they're still able to - sometimes there is no 'later'. For a 'normal' or more like 'traditional' wedding they'd amass the same cost - if they'd have to pay for hotel/transportation/gift anyways, the 12$ meal is the last straw for them? Pathetic logic.", "Yeah go if you can, wish them well  and go home if you can't.  It sucks being broke but it's not the fault of the young couple that they are also struggling??? Like people who cannot afford that should be more understanding of that, no? I'm broke AF and I have had to miss out on a few big events but I still made them a card and gave them all my best vibes lol.", "i agree!!! it\u2019s not like they\u2019re throwing a huge party and asking guests to cover the caterer or something. it\u2019s a damn meal at a restaurant. it\u2019s like if they went out to a really big family dinner imo.", "THIS!! I\u2019d be honored that they even want me there to celebrate this big life event with them, & I\u2019d be happy to pay for my own meal.", "It goes both ways though. They could have empathy for their family members and forgo the reception if they can't afford to have one. It's not like they *need* it.", "It's not wedding industry standards, it's basic courtesy.

Most people I know would be fine with it, especially given your situation. Some will be unhappy with it, no matter what.

Or did you just not say anything about them?\n\nNot offering food does go hard against the grain of guest expectations, yeah, especially if it seems like an otherwise typical wedding.  I can see how you came off looking cheap, especially in a restaurant where picking up a tab can be seen as a host's duty.\n\nI did my reception as a potluck, though - \"Food instead of gifts!\" prominent on the invitations - and it turned out quite well for everyone.  Not a single complaint.", "Some of the other comments were suggesting doing a potluck, or keeping the food more simple instead of a full on meal.\n\nOr if none of those options sound good and you really want to go all out for it, it would be better to wait till you have more money and time to spend for it.\n\nI can understand the financial constraints, but I think there is a better method instead of asking your guests to pay for their meal.", "Just do a pot luck at a park.  Pay for someone to BBQ for you.  That way people can move around freely instead of being stuck in seating in some restaurant private room.  That\u2019s what my friends did.

Having people fly out for a courthouse wedding? Then having them pay for a $12 meal? Really?? Absolutely no restaurant would split the bill into that many checks. Ever. Do your courthouse wedding then have everyone meet up at a park and grill up hotdogs and burgers for everyone. Bring cold cuts and cheese and bread. Have a picnic and enjoy each other- dont complicate it with the restaurant thing. Or get married and have your get-together next year on your first anniversary when you can do it more properly and maybe rent a room out of a restaurant and treat your family to a meal. The way you\u2019re describing your current plan is *horrificly* tacky.

The park/ potluck option is not unheard of and will allow you two to be celebrated without a huge cost. Oh, and congratulations!!!", "But you want them to pay for themselves, that\u2019s the issue. Not expecting gifts doesn\u2019t make it any better.", "Agree. They aren\u2019t even asking for gifts.", "I don't know half the couples getting married to weddings I go to.

You\u2019re a host who\u2019s inviting people to celebrate with you.", "Lol, my husband and I got married 30 years ago, and we were broke af. We told our friends and family that we could only invite everyone if they were willing to do a potluck and cash bar. No one had a problem with it - we had 150 guests. The bar made money, everyone brought something delicious to eat, and it was a super fun casual evening. Reddit wedding culture is a riot.", "Not in reddit wedding culture, unfortunately", "Aww I agree. No it\u2019s not the norm but if it\u2019s immediate family then I think it\u2019s ok. I would come and buy my own plate and cover OP and the groom\u201ds dinner as a wedding gift. They sound like good kids bless them. It\u2019s sorta tacky but each individual situation is different. If they were inviting loads of friends and expect to pay then no, but wanting immediate family there is normal. \n\nNTA and I wish OP and fianc\u00e9 lasting happiness.

I don't know about other states, but I was able to scope out all the local parks in my area on the park district website, look at map layouts and prices, and then pick the time I wanted and pay online. It was $60 for a 2 hour block, there were bathroom facilities, and a super nice park district employee helped us clean up after our kid's birthday party ended. \n\nBuy some sheet cake and beverages from Costco, tie some white and gold balloons to it so people know they went to the right park pavilion, and it should cost less than $500, depending on how much you splash out on alcohol. Make a fun playlist and bring a wireless Bluetooth speaker if you want, maybe some yard games to play if people get bored or there will be a lot of children. \n\nIf I could go back, that's probably the kind of wedding I'd have, instead of the big one my parents wanted (and to be fair to them, paid for!)", "If I were OP I would probably try to budget for a small gathering at a local park or something with some bottled water and a few affordable snacks.

Like come on! \nOnly if you're struggling yourself that could be an excuse, but then I would hope everyone else would chip in.\nOr is solidarity too niche of a term nowadays?", "I totally agree, in this case it sounds like they\u2019re aware of that and are giving them the option with no pressure.

I really don\u2019t understand why this is being framed as op trying to force them to pay for her reception when it\u2019s not even really in the same ballpark. They\u2019re not splurging on other factors of the wedding and trying to be greedy and force their guests to pay, it sounds like on all fronts they\u2019re trying to be very reasonable and frugal.

It's kind of a no-win situation.\n\nEven if OP and fianc\u00e9 both go and say, donate plasma a few times, or pick up some one-off odd jobs to get money to pay for dinner, it's not going to sit well with some family members if they are invited to town, but just not especially fancy restaurant reception and not the ceremony.\n\nIt might make more sense to just have your immediate family for the courthouse and dinner afterwards.
