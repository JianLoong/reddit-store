He is in a PhD program and I'm about to enter one. We don't want to wait to get married because of school (we'd have to wait about 5-7 years). \n\nHowever, neither of us are financially supported by our parents or family members. We can't afford a normal wedding let alone a big one. We would like our families to be able to come and celebrate with us. \n\nWe are planning a small court house wedding with only our immediate families in the room. Then we want to offer dinner at a local restaurant as a wedding \"reception\". However, venue and rental and hosting costs are too pricey for us. So we offered the idea to our families that we are getting married at X place on X date and will be dining at X restaurant. If they want to celebrate with us they will have to pay for their own meals at the restaurant (it's a family style sit down resturant so ~$12 average per entr\u00e9e).\n\nWe have gotten some backlash from family members who don't want to or can't afford to pay for travel to our town plus hotel plus dinner. They're saying we should be more traditional, should wait til we can afford a wedding before getting married, etc. \n\nEDIT: we are not asking for gifts (actually encouraging people don't bring gifts). We live out of town from family that is all spread out across the US and UK (we're planning to honeymoon in UK after school is over to visit that family). So there is no house or backyard option. We are going to either rent the restaurant space for a couple hours or rent a venue whichever seems like it will work best. There are of course no hard feelings or expectations if someone can't/doesn't want to attend. It's a very relaxed style get together/celebration. \"Reception\" seems to be too formal of a word. \n\nEDIT: we would like to avoid postponing the nuptials and celebration due to my desire for my grandparents to be able to attend as in a few years they might not be able to due to health or may not still be with us. \n\nAITA for not being able to afford to feed extended family and plus ones at my wedding reception and offered they come celebrate but pay their own way.", "created_utc": 1681585454, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nevpb/aita_for_asking_my_wedding_guests_to_pay_for/", "score": 3370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The top y t a comments I saw are coming off extremely judgemental and calling you tacky and suggesting bbqs and crap (as if that doesn't also cost money and is a lot more work than going to a restaurant???). Nonsense. Even if it is \"tacky\", who cares? And I don't think it is.\n\nIt's your wedding.\n\nYou made the rules.\n\nYou communicated them and were up front about everything.\n\nMaybe the way you're doing things is different from others, but you don't need to shy away from that just because some people have their panties in a bunch. You're not being an asshole in any way.", "NTA. None of the people complaining here would be this upset if you were talking about a birthday celebration instead of a wedding. \"You shouldn't be asking other people to pay for your wedding!!!!\" Y'all are acting like they're setting up a GoFundMe or sending vendor invoices to their families. They're literally just saying \"Hey, we're getting married! After that, we're going out to eat at this restaurant. If you'd like to come celebrate with us, we would love to see you, but you will need to pay for your own meal.\" There's literally nothing wrong with that. They aren't asking for gifts or cash or someone to pay for a month long tropical honeymoon. \n\nSome of y'all clearly only go to weddings for the free food/booze and it shows.", "INFO: Will you be upset if people choose not to show up?", "NTA as long as you\u2019re up front about it and not also expecting gifts", "If your family wants a more \u201ctraditional\u201d wedding, the parents of the bride should pay for it. \n\nI\u2019m going against the grain here and saying NTA.  It\u2019s your wedding and reception, you should do as you wish. Just know that some people won\u2019t be able to go. \n\nYou could live stream the wedding for the family and friends that can\u2019t make it. They could still \u201ccelebrate\u201d from afar and still feel included.", "I went to 2 weddings last year, one dinner was paid, so i gave a gift of about equal value to the dinner, and the other i had to pay my dinner so they didn't get a gift.\n\nIt's not a big deal. Just dont expect gifts.\n\nNTA, if $12-30 is going to break their bank that much, they probably should stay home.", "You can ask, but they may not come. I personally think NTA, but I doubt I'll get much love for that on this sub.\n\nMaybe rent a gym and do a potluck? I've been to a potluck wedding before and it was fine. Weddings have traditionally only had lavish feasts in the last 50-60 years. More materialism now.", "So I think I\u2019m in the minority on this one. NTA. It sounds like you\u2019re primarily doing this so that family who wants to be there to celebrate has the opportunity to do so. If they don\u2019t want to come, they don\u2019t have to. Do your thing.", "NTA:  I don't see any difference between a modest restaurant party and a modest potluck reception.  Both scenarios have the guests paying for their own meals.  Both scenarios (likely) have the wedding couple reserving and paying for either a private room in a restaurant, a hall, or a park fee - possibly with a covered area.  \n\n\nThey essentially amount to very similar parties.  The hall or park would let you celebrate longer, but the restaurant offers standardized food with someone else taking care of cleanup.    \n\n\nOn a limited budget, there's a winning choice in here for anyone who doesn't want to blow a house downpayment or several years of college on a wedding.  People who want to support you will come.  People who have issues with your marriage or with optics... won't.   You'll know who your friends are.  \n\n\nCongratulations and best wishes going forward in the future!", "NTA \nOne of the best engagement celebrations I went to the guests all paid for themselves. \n\nOnly the people that really want to be there will attend rather than people just wanting free food and drink.\n\nCongratulations to you both,wishing you  gorgeous wedding celebrations.", "NTA. But then again, if getting married is so important to you, you should do it without family present. Get married anyway, they got the offer and declined.", "NTA,\n\nYou can't help being too young to have a big wedding financially.\n\nBut since I saw you write somewhere you don't expect gifts (even though people will be buying them). Why not tell people that as a gift you would love for them to come to dinner with you. That way you can have your reception, your dinner and instead of spending $50-$100 on a present the guests could spend it on their own food. \n\nJust a thought, hopefully you'll have a wonderful wedding either way!", "NTA. We did the same thing. We didn't ask any gifts, we didn't expect anyone to come. We did pay for the drinks and some appetizers at the reception. People were happy to attend, and those who wanted to stay for lunch after the reception paid for their own meal. \nEveryone was happy.", "I can tell I\u2019m going to be unpopular, but NTA. As long as you\u2019re not mad if someone doesn\u2019t come, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to have this kind of reception. If possible, it might be nice to have drinks or appetizers for the table that you pay for. But I don\u2019t think you have to wait until you can afford a traditional wedding. I would probably not call it a reception. My sister did this fifteen years ago and she asked us to all come celebrate if we were up for it. Only local people came. Yes, some were disappointed. But that\u2019s life.", "NTA. For a simple courthouse wedding I don\u2019t think this is wrong. They can skip it if it bothers them.", "Nta. This is coming from the point that you are actually being about the marriage not the wedding. If they\u2019re excited and happy AND want to be there, they can come! If not, you understand! But asking you to postpone your wedding until you can buy them a meal is completely unreasonable.", "against the popular opinion here, im going to go with \n\nNTA. \n\nwhy? because it\u2019s your wedding and it\u2019s your life. it\u2019s your happiness. if i was in this situation as your family member i would either come if i had the money or politely decline if i didn\u2019t and wish you the best in your marriage. it\u2019s as simple as that. you don\u2019t owe anyone anything. it\u2019s YOUR marriage. i personally think your parents suck. if you\u2019re in college and doing great, you love each other and you\u2019re really certain this is what you want out of life then they could at least offer some help. i would never let my kid go without assistance in their wedding especially if they\u2019re a full time college student. my therapist told me the best advice - don\u2019t live your life for anyone but yourself (i spent my entire first 22 years trying to always always always please my friends and family) i will spend the next 22 pleasing myself. i\u2019m now much happier. i advise you do the same.", "NTA", "Sometimes this wedding culture really surprises me. \nAll the OP and her fiance suggested is to come if you want to the place where they will be celebrating their small wedding. They just gave a chance of attendance to anyone who wanted it, and if not - no hard feelings. Cause otherwise there wouldn't be even a chance as they don't have money for traditional reception. \nIt's like a more polite way of elopement - we are getting married anyway, you can attend if you want to. \nNTA", "Nope. Nope. Nope. I was going to avoid YTA until that last para. Yikes. You\u2019re not \u201coffering\u201d anything.

Small courthouse wedding and those few guests that came to the courthouse with you go for cake and punch after.  No meal at all.  \nNTA for not being able to afford a normal wedding as they are expensive.  And NTA for being honest and saying we would love to have you but it is part your own way as we can't afford to feed everyone.  You are being honest and up front about it.", "NTA you told your friends and family where you were eating and said they could join if they wanted. You are not hosting a party. If people can\u2019t afford to come, you can tell them you appreciate their support and would be happy to have a drink next time they are in town. In would even have called it a reception. I think that\u2019s where people are fussed because they have their own expectations of what that entails.", "NTA so long as this is in place of wedding gifts, based on the UK subs it's pretty common to give enough money to cover your meal when attending a wedding here\n\nAlso you aren't demanding they come, if they can't afford to come they don't have to, just like you can't afford a big wedding so you're having a small one", "YTA. If you can\u2019t afford a wedding don\u2019t have one. Elope. Or do a potluck. But to ask guests to pay is not cool.", "Normally, I'd go Y T A, but I feel like NTA in this instance. My friend was having a large, traditional ceremony in a different country, but she invited me and a few other people to her courthouse wedding in our city. This was followed by a restaurant meal, and I felt like it made sense for each person to pay for their food under those circumstances. This was made clear well before the day of, and it just felt less like a party and more like a meal with friends, kind of like a birthday meal (the bride and groom paid for the wine and their own food).", "INFO: did you formally invite them to the reception or is this more of a \"hey we're basically eloping, but you're welcome to come party with us if you want\"?", "NTA. As long as you present the offer in a polite way and don\u2019t necessarily expect big gifts I think it\u2019s completely fine.", "NTA. If the want to come they should come and thats that.", "NTA we had a similar affair for our wedding (we had ours during lockdown, in the UK, 10 people total including ourselves) and had a sit down meal at a local restaurant, to which our family members paid for themselves and also paid for us... it feels weird to me that in other countries and families, its felt that the bride & groom should be paying for everyone, when in our family, it's the other family members \"treat\" the couple/person for the special event we're celebrating.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding, do what you want. \n\nIf people find it tacky, forget em.\n\nThese people are supposed to be here to celebrate you. I don't understand why everyone is so up in arms about you HAVING to foot the bill. If they don't want to go to your wedding to celebrate your union, then don't come.\n\nTo get up in arms over money is ridiculous. It's weird as hell that people would be offended when they know your situation. How are they family if they aren't even willing to try to understand your situation? Where's the love in all that?\n\nThe most ridiculous thing is they're up in arms over 12 dollars?!? What, are some of these people essentially homeless or something; to throw a dang fit over 12 dollars?!?!?!", "YTA\n\nIf you can't afford $12/plate come up with a different plan.

I would pay for my own meal to celebrate a family or friend\u2019s marriage.

You keep trying to please what it sounds like are ungrateful and stingy af people. I hope you both have a lovely wedding, and good luck with those PhDs! Mine is stressing me the heck out.", "Wow. People are really upset about this. I think NTA. What, only well off people can have a wedding celebration? OP isn\u2019t asking for anything extravagant and isn\u2019t expecting gifts.

My wife and I got married a year ago and did this. There were important aspects that we wanted and many of our family wanted a reception but didn\u2019t understand we didn\u2019t have the money for that. We compromised and had a wedding and had a reception at a restaurant and everyone took care of their own bills. We didn\u2019t expect gifts and we didn\u2019t get many and that\u2019s ok because that wasn\u2019t what it was about. \nYou do whatever makes you happy and whatever works in your budget.

Nobody is supposed to go bankrupt.", "My sister did this, had a courthouse wedding with just family, then lunch at a restaurant near by. NTA. do want you want to do and if others want to join then they can. Just don\u2019t call it a wedding or reception, because they\u2019re not. You can tell people you are eloping. If they ask about a reception you can tell people we aren\u2019t having a reception due to money but you are having lunch at X after going to the courthouse.

People will forget after 10 years or they\u2019ll pull a face that lets you know they don\u2019t see the marriage to last that long. Good way to weed out some less desirable peeps.

Good luck!", "The ppl who are offended are the ones you don't need there. \n\nIt's such a small amount per couple/family. \n\nTho I would expect local only other than parents/siblings. \n\nAlso a group over 8-10 is usually forced to pay one bill and taxed a surcharge. Keep that in mind.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You're being upfront about the situation, and it's not like you're trying to make money off the situation somehow.

Your going to a restaurant, you\u2019re not having a big wedding I believe it is perfectly reasonable to ask people to pay for their own meal at a restaurant.

Potluck, BBQ, or something similar", "NTA!!! \nits your wedding and you decide how things go. youre not even forcing people to come and springing it on them that youre not paying. youre offering them to come celebrate afterwards(where dinner is about 12 dollars you said) and if they \u201ccant afford\u201d to pay for their own, at most, 20$ dinner then thats on them. you said that no one is financially helping yall with this wedding, but they also expect you to go all out so they can be apart of things. they were upset when your sister eloped, for financial reasons i assume? do whats best for you and the people who actually care about celebrating yall\u2019s newly wed life will pay for their meals without question.", "NTA. You get to have your wedding how you want. One suggestion for approaching it differently if you\u2019re looking for advice. You could request cash gifts in lieu of a registry, use that to pay for the meal, then probably have leftover to have some fun.", "NTA, my wedding was small with 12 people and then we went to a local bar and let people know they were welcome to come have a drink with us if they were so inclined. It was so much better than my first wedding where the bar bill alone was over $5k and people came just for free food and drink.

My parents wedding back in the 70s everyone brought something to share for their backyard wedding and they wouldn\u2019t change a thing.", "NTA as this does not sound like an actual reception more like a \"come watch us get married than have dinner with us' sort of thing.  If you were throwing an actual reception than you would be.", "I don't understand. Neither of you are financially supported by your families. Yet your families want to come to your wedding, and are perfectly willing to travel to do so. But, they won't incur the cost of dinner? It just doesn't make sense. Many, many people's parents/families pay for their weddings, they just aren't usually handed a bill \\*at\\* the reception dinner table. If they think it's tacky to ask all guests to pay their own way, but they want you to have a wedding reception and know you can't afford it, then someone in your family should step up and foot the bill, particularly for something as modest as dinner at a restaurant with $12 entrees! But if literally none of you--not you, your fianc\u00e9 or anyone in either of your families who is interested in attending--can actually afford to host a small dinner party, then don't have one?

I went to several where people used someone's living room or common room at their apartment complex (or went to a park), bought trays from the grocery store or Costco, replated items onto nice platters and serving dishes, borrowed nice table linens and silverware from their relatives and friends, and did a \"tea reception\" which consisted of sandwiches, crudites, maybe fruit skewers, and cake and punch. In fact, cake-and-punch receptions used to be a thing - there'd just be the wedding cake, some punch, maybe some coffee and cookies someone's mom or grandma made, and that's it. If you get married either in the early morning or in the early afternoon, you can get away with not having to feed people a meal and still have a nice, casual gathering.

If you throw a small wedding, they\u2019ll be mad they didn\u2019t get invited. If you throw a big but stripped down wedding, they\u2019ll complain it\u2019s not fancy enough. If you elope and don\u2019t officially inform them in some way (by mail or in person, mass social media is obviously unacceptable to them) they\u2019ll complain you didn\u2019t tell them. If you do tell them, they\u2019ll say you just want gifts. If you literally tell them it\u2019s happening at the courthouse and they can come to Applebees after if they want and also no gifts, they still complain.", "No one's being forced to come.

You don't want to go to celebrate a wedding, you want to go play dress up and have a free feed.

I live in the northeast and I\u2019ve never been invited to a potluck reception - it would be seen as incredibly tacky here. Plus that would piss me off way more than paying for my own dinner (something I also think is tacky because now I need to cook and transport). I also wouldn\u2019t want the liability of feeding my guests food that may have not been prepared and stored safely, etc.\n\nIf I were OP, I\u2019d do the courthouse wedding and ask people to feel free to stop by a local bar/pub to celebrate (while making it clear food/drinks won\u2019t be provided).", "Thank you! Thought I was going crazy reading some of these replies! Unless the B&G are paying for all the ingredients for their guests to contribute to a potluck, it still costs the guests money. And odds are the guests would bring a gift to a potluck. OP isn\u2019t asking for gifts. Cheaper for the guests to do it her way.", "Agreed! Plus I don't understand how a potluck isn't tacky but asking people to pay for a reasonably priced dinner in leue of a gift is.

So minimum $24 for me and a plus one. Plus a tip. Hope you're drinking water and skipping desert.", "Why do they have to accommodate everyone for a day that\u2019s meant to be about them, the two people getting married. They already made concessions not eloping to appease parents. Why do they have to negotiate away from what would make them happy anymore than they have?", "Yeah it doesn't need to be fancy.

You may want to look into that as well. Going to a restaurant really isn't a good idea in this situation.", "But 50 people is a (relatively) big wedding. Why not invite only the most important people, make it a small wedding and buy them dinner for a couple of hundred $? Or is that still too much? I get that you try to come up with a better plan than elope, so that you don't upset your family, but reality is that they get upset if you elope and they get upset if they have to travel and buy themselves dinner. You can't get it right for everyone, so choose the option that makes you two the happiest. Congrats!", "Simply curiosity. 50 people at $12 a plate is $600.

They had a reception that had a bar.  \n\nIn our area it is tradition to have Jack and jills.  You have a party to raise money for the wedding.  We did this for tradition not because we needed it.

You're plenty enough to the people who truly care. Have a great time. Your day, not theirs.

Shit, I\u2019d probably buy their meal as a gift. But I also don\u2019t want to split a tab with 20 of their friends and relatives. But then, I also wouldn\u2019t fly down for it. \n\nI think the sticky prt is if it\u2019s an \u201cinvitation\u201d.

They are young, in love, and they want to do it now despite their financial difficulties because they want their grandparents to attend while they're still able to - sometimes there is no 'later'.

Or did you just not say anything about them?\n\nNot offering food does go hard against the grain of guest expectations, yeah, especially if it seems like an otherwise typical wedding.  I can see how you came off looking cheap, especially in a restaurant where picking up a tab can be seen as a host's duty.\n\nI did my reception as a potluck, though - \"Food instead of gifts!\" prominent on the invitations - and it turned out quite well for everyone.  Not a single complaint.", "Some of the other comments were suggesting doing a potluck, or keeping the food more simple instead of a full on meal.\n\nOr if none of those options sound good and you really want to go all out for it, it would be better to wait till you have more money and time to spend for it.\n\nI can understand the financial constraints, but I think there is a better method instead of asking your guests to pay for their meal.", "Just do a pot luck at a park.

Have a picnic and enjoy each other- dont complicate it with the restaurant thing. Or get married and have your get-together next year on your first anniversary when you can do it more properly and maybe rent a room out of a restaurant and treat your family to a meal.

You\u2019re a host who\u2019s inviting people to celebrate with you.", "Lol, my husband and I got married 30 years ago, and we were broke af. We told our friends and family that we could only invite everyone if they were willing to do a potluck and cash bar. No one had a problem with it - we had 150 guests. The bar made money, everyone brought something delicious to eat, and it was a super fun casual evening. Reddit wedding culture is a riot.", "Not in reddit wedding culture, unfortunately", "Aww I agree. No it\u2019s not the norm but if it\u2019s immediate family then I think it\u2019s ok. I would come and buy my own plate and cover OP and the groom\u201ds dinner as a wedding gift. They sound like good kids bless them. It\u2019s sorta tacky but each individual situation is different. If they were inviting loads of friends and expect to pay then no, but wanting immediate family there is normal. \n\nNTA and I wish OP and fianc\u00e9 lasting happiness.

I don't know about other states, but I was able to scope out all the local parks in my area on the park district website, look at map layouts and prices, and then pick the time I wanted and pay online. It was $60 for a 2 hour block, there were bathroom facilities, and a super nice park district employee helped us clean up after our kid's birthday party ended. \n\nBuy some sheet cake and beverages from Costco, tie some white and gold balloons to it so people know they went to the right park pavilion, and it should cost less than $500, depending on how much you splash out on alcohol.
