Frank wouldn\u2019t stop abusing me for not working as if i was fully fit and was basically telling me i shouldn\u2019t be there if i couldn\u2019t work like everyone else. matt was also giving me the cold shoulder, although at this point i hadn\u2019t done anything at all to him, just checked how he was going etc. 2 days later, i\u2019d had enough. i started looking for an employment opportunity elsewhere and found one who hired me on the same day as a backup for what was shortly to follow. In Australia, we have really good worker\u2019s compensation schemes, so to make up for my lost income i launched a claim and told my boss at the tyre shop that i had. he then proceeded the threaten me basically saying matt would lose his license and we would have to give statements etc trying to guilt my way out of going ahead with it. i still did it. my boss didn\u2019t like this and got the police to investigate the incident. a few weeks later, i got a payout from workers compensation however by this point matt had unadded me everywhere. i soon found out he received a 6 month license suspension because of my boss, however i couldn\u2019t clarify it was my boss\u2019 fault and not mine as he had already blocked me. soon after, i heard rumours through the car community depicting me as an awful person for launching the claim and bringing police attention his way, however it was my boss who tipped them off. long story short, i\u2019ve since started a much better job and everyone at my old job hates me because of matt\u2019s rumours. i can\u2019t help but feel guilty for what happened; should i?", "created_utc": 1675430892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10skb1q/aita_my_friend_almost_killed_me_in_a_car_accident/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This makes it clear he is immature and not worthy of your time. Also a road hazard :/", "No, NTA. Or, possibly, NTA *enough*.\n\nHad you had an attorney assisting you instead of acting on your own, it is possible that you would have been more effective keeping your legal relationship with your old job separate from questions of professionalism and personal loyalty. Some people are better at that, and attorneys usually fall into that category. They would have been able to focus on the compensation and your rights in a way that hinted or said the other parts were irrelevant.\n\nOr maybe not! In any case you're in a better place and got what you're entitled to.", "NTA.\n\nIf your boss was doing his JOB and putting a stop to the harassment, nothing would have escalated.

Seems bizarre.", "NTA, Matt did something stupid AF and found out.", "NTA\u2026the only thing you have to feel guilty about is being young and dumb and even entertaining the thought of a fun ride on a curvy road in slick weather.  Lesson learned and thankfully you survived.  Matt was already distancing himself.  Why?  One can only guess.  But a true friend does not ignore you, especially when they were the driver.  They ask how you are, what can they do for you?  Frank sounds horrible.  You did the right thing and are better off where you are now.  Stop giving them so much of your thoughts and time.", "I\u2019m confused how Matt avoided a crash investigation and suspension of his license just from the ambulance showing up.

You and Matt went out to play on a windy road under less than ideal circumstances and crashed out. Your saving grace was you weren't driving and asked Matt to ease off. But it was a mutually bad decisions with serious impact on your health.\nYou went back to work and Frank made it a hostile environment so you left. Leaving meant you needed to claim compensation and that led to enquiry. I don't think your boss was wrong to follow procedure. But he tried to talk you out of compensation due to impact on Matt. If so worried, your boss could have eaten the loss. He didn't and you likely couldn't so Matt suffered. I get why he is angry but foreseeable consequence of that bad decision in first place. He was driving unsafely and it led to you losing your job.", "NTA but I would sue him big time", "NTA but please be safer in your choices", "Came here to say this. And in one of the employee's private vehicle, no less.", "agreed.  OP knew the tyres matt had, and still went out in torrential rain to a known windy road as though the plan wasn't always to go way too fast down it.  for that OP *has* to take some responsibility.  No, he was not driving, BUT he's still a grown up who made that decision.  \n\nHOWEVER\n\nMatt was clearly feeling a type of way about it *before* OP got back to work - feeling guilty perhaps, and rather than deal with his issues or even talk about it like a grown up, he lased out at OP, punishing them unfairly rather than admit that what he did was stupid, immature, and utterly preventable.    \n\n\nMatt is an asshole.  had it just been the cold shoulder, again maybe out of guilt, then okay but everything after that?? nah that's an asshole  \nFrank is an asshole  \nBoss is an asshole\n\nOP is a *very mild* asshole/sucks/made a massive mistake I've no doubt he won't make again", "NTA. I don't understand why you qualify for workers comp when you were on lunchbreak but am not in Australia. \n\nIf you qualify for compensation you file but should also report your old boss for threatening your job for filing which is retaliation. \n\nMatt was driving stupidly and caused the accident by driving on bald tires in the rain and taking chances.\n\nGood for you for fi di g a new job so quickly", "No", "Nta but also your \u2018friend\u2019 and your former boss are definitely the A\u2019s. \n\nAnytime you hear a story from them just remind the peanut gallery that you were almost killed in what could\u2019ve been classed as negligent homicide and instead of being mad about it, you moved on.", "NTA.

In Australia we have cover for to and from work as well (depending on the industry). Although it could also be the harassment he suffered and made him leave his job that got the compensation.
