His request to bring her along on the trip is also a AH move.\n\nWhile you are paying for the trip, you might be wise to consider other opinions.

He worked odd hours so was often around in the day. She knew when his car was there and hers wasn't. He let her get too close, too friendly, because she was widowed. His wife failed to see the danger. My father in law was really angry with her deliberate, 'setting of her sights' on him. FIL wanted to warn him, but felt that it wasn't his place to do so. He knew that the couple would stay a couple for life if that woman wasn't around. They had been married over 30 years. But he was really flattered with the attention and his head was completely turned by her. He was an idiot basically. He left his wife for her. She was for sure a home wrecker.
