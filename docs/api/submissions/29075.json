Your mom didn't show much respect for that teen.", "NTA and not only that, WTH does \"too pretty to be talking like that\" even mean? *Oh, never mind, you're plain enough to swear after all.* LOL", "NTA, your mom has no business telling other kids what to do unless they are either, A. Under her direct supervision, or B. They are actively participating in dangerous behavior that could cause harm to someone or damage to property that doesn\u2019t belong to them. \n\nKids cursing is nothing new and your mom gained nothing by speaking up about it. That girl isn\u2019t going to stop cursing, so it ends up being a fruitless endeavor", "NTA, I don\u2019t think anyone should be publicly commenting about someone else\u2019s swearing anyways (at least in a non professional situation). Maybe if she said it after you guys had left the elevator but saying it to them is just AH behaviour. The whole \u201crespecting your elders\u201d thing is pretty dated too. Swearing about something is different than AT someone", "I had to reread this after I saw several comments that your mom is 40.  I really thought she was 80 in this story.\n\nNTA.  She needs to mind her business.  Her behavior is ridiculous.\n\nEdited to add:  She also had you when she was 17, so I'm sure she had a wild youth.", "NTA.

Teenagers swear and I\u2019m pretty sure they always have not just today. \n\nNTA.", "NTA I bet she has a bad time in life since dropping an f bomb is p normal for a teenager lmaooo also it isnt her business. That girl may have apologized,but someday your mom may FAFO and have a real bad time.", "Nta, it wasnt like the kid was working and cussed. She didn\u2019t use the cuss word towards anyone.

Not her kids, not hurting anyone or damaging anything = not her business. And if she's 40 now, that puts her at that age in the late 90s/early 00s right? So, it wouldn't exactly shock me to find out things just as bad if not worse came out of her mouth at that age. Is it immature? Yeah, it is.

Respect is something earned not given by automatic deference. Also swearing? Stop caring for fucks sake. NTA", "NTA. The way I would be using \"bad words\" to your mom if she said to me, especially if I apologized. If she thinks she needs to be respected for being older, she needs to respect others for being strangers.", "Kids *these days*? I\u2019m older than your mom and I barely ever met a kid who never used the big F by the time they were 13 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. I think you are right on this one. Your mom wasn't set on this earth to referee other people.\n\nYes, good parents and friends and relatives can help a child grow into a kind and productive adult (or not...) but trying to \"parent\" complete strangers is just wrong in my opinion.", "NTA but wait the math\u2026 So your mom was 17 when she had you? Is your sister older or younger? Maybe being a mom so young forced her to grow up too fast?", "She is coping with aging by hating on the younger generations", "NTA. Kinda strange that your mom is so young and saying stuff like that to kids that age. Based on the math, your mom had you a couple years beyond their age so she should know about how even young people have control over their own actions. Maybe she wishes someone policed her when she was young and thinks she\u2019s doing everyone a favor? Disregard if you think this is a ridiculous thought.", "I tried to tell her that! My mom is always going on about what\u2019s wrong with todays kids and how they don\u2019t respect people older than them.

People are so wild nowadays I\u2019m afraid someone\u2019s gonna get on her for trying to clock other peoples kids.", "Yeah the girl was so quick to apologize I felt bad about my mom getting on her. And it\u2019s so crazy though because my sister knew what girl our mom was talking about the second my mom said the girl cursed. Apparently the girl curses a lot and so my sister doesn\u2019t like her all too much either lol. But from the stories my sister was telling about the girl she\u2019s not even a bad kid, just a girl with a sailor mouth.", "Your mother sounds like she is 90, not 40.  This is very \"Silent Generation\" of her.  Respect is always earned.  It is never due (beyond simply respecting that someone else is a human being and sharing space with you).

She had at least one kid AS A TEENAGER, and she is going around complaining about how bad kids are these days? \n\nYikes.", "NTA\n\nYour new words for when mum does this again \"MOTHER STOP THIS NOW\" \n\nwalking away is optional\n\nadding on phrases is optional too;\n-I'll have to tell your doctor/probation officer\n-remember what happened last time", "NTA\n\nBut, is this a hill to die on?", "I understand watching what you say in front  of older people.  \nI\u2019d be annoyed if someone was swearing in from of my grandmother (late 90s). \nBut it\u2019s not up to me to harass those people for it.  \nNTA", "NTA. Listen I ain't from the city but I know to leave people's kids alone and definitely leave people in the Bronx, Brooklyn,and Queens kids alone. It's not an argument I at my big age wanna enter into cause I ain't gonna win. Besides those kids seemed nice enough, they apologized. My in laws grandkids would have flipped out. I hate to hear kids loudly cursing in public but the way these kids built these days, nah I'll mind my business and work with my nieces and nephews on acceptable public behavior.", "So your Mom can't \"school\" someone for foul language but you can \"school\" her on what you think is inappropriate? This is hilarious.", "Right?? It's sexist, at best. Yuck!", "\"But it was the 90's, everybody was doing it!\"", "Today\u2019s kids are being taught that respect is earned, not owed, and I love it for them.", "Ehm, you might wanna check your math \ud83d\ude05 It feels like that to me too and i get a shock when I realise when kids in the early 20s were actually born.  \nBut I'm not old!!!", "OP would've been born sometime during 2000, which still technically is the 90's!"]}
