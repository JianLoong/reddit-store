Coming to someone after an event and asking for money, whether they showed up or not, is wrong. There can be no reasonable expectation of someone paying for something after the fact if there was no agreed upon price prior to said event. The proper way for the organizer to do this would have been to ask for the money at the time of the RSVP, not after.", "YWNBTA only if the event stated that everyone would need to pay a specific price would you be in the wrong here. It sucks but it's unreasonable to just front the cost on you like this without those specific details disclosed. \n\nIf they were that much a stickler for the cost of it, they should state the overall price people would need to pay or be splitting and saying that if you RVSP yes then due to the reservation then if something were to happen they would still need to pay their part so rsvp carefully.", "YTA - You committed to attend and pay. You did not change this status despite having a change in finances which should have been a big motivator. If you cancelled this fee would be a non issue. Reimburse what you can otherwise the organizer is stuck with your confirmed attendance fee.
