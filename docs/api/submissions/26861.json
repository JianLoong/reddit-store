Do you know any other caregivers who can use extra money? If you do maybe recommend one to be the person who can come over on the weekend when A wants time to herself.", "NTA\n\n\"Full-time\" is not \"around the clock\" here.

Best not to discuss them at work. It is easy for you to be seen as family and your obligations increase. Set boundaries.  Emergencies only.", "NTA. It\u2019s the weekend. Why are you giving \u201cA\u201d explanations? Simply say, \u201cSorry. I\u2019m not available on the weekends.\u201d And repeat as necessary.", "NTA you shouldn\u2019t even be running errands for her ever, your job is to take care of the patient not their middle aged adult daughter.", "I do work for an agency that could send someone but we are a bit understaffed. The state also decides how many hours a week a patient can have.", "I am paid hourly.

My agency and I have worked out a schedule that works for me.", "So many wrong takes in this comment", "Honestly I wouldn't even do this, because A sounds like someone who will then blame you if that person isn't available or she doesn't like them.", "I don't actually know any of the other caretakers for my agency. We're pretty independent and I never go to the office so I have no clue who works for my agency. I can definitely communicate with my boss and see if they're able to ask around if it happens again!", "then just politely tell them no youre not available on weekends and do not elaborate on why.", "Don't listen to this commenter.  If you work for an agency just tell A to reach out to the agency for weekend help.  Period.  Don't get emotionally invested (hard, I know).", "Seems like the positive of this will outweigh the negatives. \n\nIf OP does nothing things remain the same, she will get called every weekend and when she declines A will get up set. \n\nIf she does my suggestion and it goes bad A will call her only if the other person does bad or not available which will be less calls compared to every weekend. \n\nBut if it goes well ...A get to enjoy her weekend and not be a caregiver to her mom,OP gets to enjoy her weekend without having to worry about hearing from A and the new caregiver can make some extra money.", "My suggestion is that OP refers A to the agency and stands firm on not working weekends.

If you want to take on the extra job/work on the weekends, do it. If you don't, then don't.

But, I doubt that you would have trouble finding a new client - just something to be aware of.", "NTA\u2026where is the patients partner in all of this?  Why can\u2019t they take care of their partner in the weekends?  Either way, you need to tell A now that you only work weekdays.  She will have to find other care or another caregiver for the weekends.", "NTA, but I'm locked in my bedroom all day during the week too, because I work from home and I'm working every day.\n\nJust saying - maybe A has a reason that she's not available during the week.", "Nope. And make a solid proof contract. Charge $$$/hour for weekends at least. Daughter A is a pain in the ass.", "NTA: how is it that you are permitted to leave your client alone at home? Who hired you? Do you work for an agency?

It sounds a LOT like you're letting personal and professional boundaries get crossed though. Why are you running errands for her at all? Are you getting paid for the time and mileage for that as well?\n\nAt any rate, feel free to take your weekends off. She needs to find other people to handle those.", "And if she's in the US, hours over 40 are OT. (She says it's state paid.)", "That is not how elderly care works at all.

A comes out late in the evening to eat and always complains about having a headache and is always talking about finding a job:/", "So are you working unpaid hours on the weekend?", "Then it sounds like you are doing a LOT of additional work without being paid. You're letting professional and personal get way too mixed up here. She's clearly gotten used to that and is taking heavy advantage of you.\n\nI strongly suggest you scale back to just the duties you are paid for. Once you've done that for a while, you'll be in a position to see just what else you might be willing to do and when.", "It\u2019s not selfish to want to work a M-F job. Many people do.", "Then you're good. NTA", "No they are paid, but I have to take another day off so that I'm not going over hours."]}
