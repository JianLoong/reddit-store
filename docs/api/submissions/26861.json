I don't want to, the weekends are the only time I can do fun things with my partner, our two closest friends and our family. A has started to get offended when I say I I have things going on.

A is offended because she's trying to take advantage of you and you're realizing that. You should scale back and only do your caretaking duties for the patient. You're not being paid to be an on-call maid, chef, personal assistant, etc. You're a caretaker and that's a specialized role. \n\nYou should remind them of your role, what you will do per your role/contract, and that you are unable to take on additional duties or days.

Do you work for an agency that might be able to provide someone else on the weekends? I would see if you can have a meeting with whoever hired you (the other parent? Both siblings? Whoever signs your paycheck/contract) and let them know you need to stick with a strictly work-week schedule.", "INFO: Are you salary? How does your scheduling with your company work? Do you make your own schedule, is it assigned or so you work it out with the family?", "You should tell A that you did this a few times to help her out, but it\u2019s not possible to do it on a regular basis. Your contract says X hours per week, Monday to Friday, and that you aren\u2019t able to work different / more hours - she can contact the agency to discuss any change in requirements.

She is taking advantage of your good nature.", "NAH\n\nask if you can take those weekend days off. like work one saturday and take the following friday off? like a day trade situation", "Id honestly say you are the asshole. A lot of people aren't as fortunate to have someone in their life that can help with them with the responsibilities of their parents.

If you work for an agency just tell A to reach out to the agency for weekend help.  Period.

But your option is better than doing nothing at all."]}
