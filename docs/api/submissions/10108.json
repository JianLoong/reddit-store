Your brother could be at fault and this is a case of fucked around and found out- or this woman could have a really toxic marriage and is staying because of your church leader\u2019s counseling. Could be a bit of both. Either way, this church is not his anymore. This is not his faith right now and maybe not ever again. \n\nI\u2019ve seen similar versions of this where someone in a family leaves a religion- and it becomes clear that their family\u2019s love, support, and contact is only there for them as long as they stay within the confines of a culture or belief system that no longer fits them. \n\nIf you love your brother, if you want to see your brother- he needs you to make the effort to tell him you want him around even if he doesn\u2019t believe in your god anymore. He sounds like he is hurting. And he needs space from your church and religion while he sorts that out. But he doesn\u2019t want space from you as his family. \n\nI went through this between 18-22. I left a church and transitioned my life. I lost a gigantic community, college scholarships, people I loved. But not my sisters. Had they treated me as you did here in this vulnerable time in my life- I would have stopped making the effort to be in their. \n\nThe question is- can you remember a time of relationship with him where God wasn\u2019t in the conversation? Can you just be his sibling? Can you all just be his family and give him the Grace and room to figure out where he lands? Can you accept if he never comes back to the church and be open to new ways of having contact with him? \n\nBecause if you can\u2019t- odds are- you lose him. Seen it happen so many times. The one who needs to seek a life outside that religion who is not supported eventually finds people who support him regardless of his faith. And they become his chosen family. \n\nI\u2019m torn between ESH and NAH because all sides seem to need to learn how to give each other some room to be themselves.

Think of this as the short lived zeal of the convert. Or, your random acquaintance who has become vegan, can\u2019t shut up about it and makes a fuss about the sight or smell of other\u2019s food. He will probably get over himself eventually. That is not to say that he will ever attend church services and may not attend special services like weddings and funerals if they are held in the church he grew up in.

The brother is upset with the pastor for the role they played in that and most of the church members have told brother to get over it and move on.", "Well unless the woman was going back to an abusive situation, your brother doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. Married people are Supposed to work out their differences and continue with their lives. If she doesn\u2019t have a signed and executed divorce decree then they\u2019re committing adultery and why would you want to be with someone like that?", "Got it.  Makes a little more sense now.  NTA still for you.  It definitely would not hurt him to put some effort in on making plans.  He'll probably come around, though, when the smoke settles.", "Is it his position that the pastor basically pushed this woman into staying a man - in what your brother views as a toxic relationship - entirely for religious reasons?", "I'm not the person you asked, but that's not an analogous situation because you didn't live with Buddha being ingrained in your life and possibly harming your life, you never lived inbthat religion, it'snot the same as living with a religion then leaving it.  \n\nSomething more analogous would be if you went somewhere and your religion didn't exist there, you would notice and feel something about that. \n\nReligion is part of his past and he will feel things about that. He would see a church and feel negatively about it because he feels negatively about the religion and thus negatively about things associated with it. \n\nNo other religion is comparable because you didn't grow up Muslim, so you're not going to feel the same way about it as somrone who grew up in the faith who now rejects the faith. It would have to be something that was always part of your life that you now reject for it to be comparable, people feel things about things they don't like that once was a constant part of their life. \n\nBecoming an athiest doesn't mean magically no longer having emotions about religion. It wouldn't, that's just not how emotions and personal relationships with religion works.\n\nHaving once lived with a religion is very different from looking at a religion but never having lived with it. Experience makes the emotions.", "So I\u2019m an atheist who was never religious (parents are also atheists). Which means I have zero religious trauma. I am able to feel pretty equally neutral about all religious ceremony and iconography, and attend religious ceremonies of all flavors. But Christians (of all flavors) are the only people who have told me that I\u2019m a bad person for my atheism, have told me I\u2019m going to hell for my atheism, have attempted (and succeeded) in forcing the government to pass laws that *i* find immoral under the guise of their religion. So yes, I have issues with Christian iconography that I don\u2019t with say, Buddhist iconography. Buddhist have never tried to tell me what to do with my life. And I feel that way, and I *didn\u2019t grow up with religious trauma*\n\nFor atheists who have left the church? Those emotions are 1000x stronger. Not only are they dealing with the general issues of being an atheist in a predominantly Christian country, they\u2019re also dealing with the very specific issues of things they were exposed to in their upbringing that may have hurt them. \n\nPlus, the new convert is always going to be more zealous than a lifelong practitioner, that tends to be true of any belief system.

Hopefully yours isn\u2019t.\n\nBecause of that, and often personal reasons or experiences, people don\u2019t just look at a church symbol or function and have no reaction.\n\nIf your brother left so completely, it\u2019s for a much bigger reason than \u201cI just don\u2019t dig God anyone\u201d. Something happened to him, personally.", "Your brother is mad at the church because gf went back to her husband. He's not an atheist, just an angry Christian. The problem is not the pastor counseling her to go back to her husband but that your brother chose to get involved with a married woman.\n\nSecular people get back together with counseling too so the outcome might be the same if he met someone outside of church.\n\nIf he wants Secular activities he needs to plan and host them rather than expecting others to do so.", "Shouldn't mean anything?? A few decades of people being horrible to me certainly mean something. I know you're busy but it's crazy you can't grasp this basic concept.", "Not anymore but I used to go out of my way to let people know I didn't like religion.  I still have my gigantic gripes about all organized religion, but I've learned to separate good aspects of various religions vs the bad when before I just saw anyone that believed in their particular organizations as mindless sheep being brainwashed by the religious leaders.  That was a very immature way of thinking and I don't feel that way anymore.  Now, to me, it's just absence of a religious belief.  \n\nI was 24 when I started being atheist if that helps at all.  I'm very open about it because I was an intolerable new atheist with a superiority complex and I hate seeing new atheists like that now even if I understand.", "It depends, most people who were raised religious and then decide to leave their religion do so because they had a bad experience.

NTA", "Honestly, though, this could go either way. Maybe he is just a jerk who felt entitled to be with a woman who changed her mind and decided to stay with her husband.

I really do not like going to church (understatement). I feel very uncomfortable and alienated. I have always felt this way. Even as a young child I really hated going to church even though I really wanted to like it. As a young adult, I would go because I thought I should and occasionally still wanted to fit into my upbringing or please my family, but it never took. I was never a particularly outspoken atheist as I do know, respect, and love many deeply religions people (although I will never understand their belief in something I find, at turns, silly, dangerous, irrational, and often extremely hypocritical and malicious).
