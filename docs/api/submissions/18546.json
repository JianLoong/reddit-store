Towards the end of our final year of school, when we turn 18, our schools organise something called a Formal, which I suppose is a bit like a prom without the romantic aspects as you\u2019re not expected to go with anybody, and the idea of promposals generally isn\u2019t something that\u2019s done here.\n\nNearly 10 years ago, as I was preparing to leave school, I found out that, not only did a boy in my class have a massive crush on me for years, but he was planning one of these massive \u201cpromposals\u201d that are often done at proms. He had always been a horrendous bully to me. He would go from calling me hideous and claiming that I would die alone and unloved, to stealing my friend\u2019s phone to get my number, or sneaking up behind me and cutting out strands of my hair that to keep, or going so far as to find my house through my father\u2019s distinctive car.\n\nNaturally, when the day for his \u201cpromposal\u201d came along, he came out with his sign in front of the entire school, and I bluntly said no and walked away. I don\u2019t like confrontation or arguments, but I had no intention of sparing his feelings after all he had done, and I was honestly just uncomfortable and wanted to leave. He badgered me until the day I left school for turning him down and being heartless. His friends did the same. I didn\u2019t care.\n\nI recently met one of his old friends in my old town. I went to the business where one of them was working, and he kept bringing this up, saying that my bully had gotten depressed after we left school and hadn\u2019t dated at all because he was embarrassed from the rejection and was still hung up over me. He kept asking me why I felt it was OK to reject him like that over some nasty words, and if I was really that petty. I got sick of it, so I told him. Turns out that, because all of these creepy things had happened within the classroom, he hadn\u2019t seen them, or even heard of them happening. His friends and my other bullies within the class were covering for him. The friend abruptly left without a word, but apparently, the gossip did the rounds.\n\nNow, the friend group is divided in two. Many of those who didn\u2019t know are pissed at him for lying, and pissed that their other friends hid what was happening as they think it went too far. The others are pissed at me for airing his dirty laundry. His parents apparently also know now, and they\u2019re pissed that he had their sympathy through lies, and now know that he practically stalked me, which brings up questions about whether they want him to take over the small farm vs a younger brother. I wonder if I should have just let his friend be mad at me. I\u2019d probably have never seen him again, anyway. I didn\u2019t know that he would tell anyone as he\u2019d never been one for gossip that I knew of, but I also didn\u2019t expect this to potentially ruin the life of someone I haven\u2019t seen for nearly a decade.\n\nAITA for telling his friend the truth about what happened?", "created_utc": 1685451939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vpt4z/aita_for_revealing_why_i_rejected_a_promposal/", "score": 1726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He opened himself up to public rejection by making the \"promposal\" public in the first place.\n2) So for all these years did these people only consider \"yes\" an appropriate response from you? You don't owe anyone a date whatever level of bullying, be it nasty words or full on stalking, indifference or friendliness.\n\nLike the rest doesn't even have to be addressed, they're all weird for carrying this grudge in the first place and acting like there's nothing wrong with him being upset about it years later.", "NTA why take the blame because he was a bully that turned to a stalker", "NTA-  the friend had no place harassing you and  confronting/pressuring/guilt tripping you about something that did not involve them 10 YEARS ago.

Wow. So NTA.", "It is weird that they expect you to accept his promposal. You were not lovers or boyfriend and girlfriend, you didn't hang out, etc. You were even not friends. So, it is very normal for you to reject, even if there were no bullying. Do they really think that you should marry someone you don't like, just because he is a \"good\" guy JUST after high school? Of course, NTA for so many reasons.", "NTA. Does his old friend realized he bullied you into telling him the truth? Parents of bullies like to say: they'll grow out of it.

You didn\u2019t ruin his life, his past behavior has finally just caught up with him.\n\nAnd that some folks didn\u2019t know? He hid it from them because he knew what he was doing was fucked up.

Has nothing gone in their lives since then that they're still hanging onto HS drama that didn't even directly involve them?  Just go on with your life OP and forget these people.", "NTA. You told everyone the truth about what he put you through. When other people give you grief about his mental health because you rightly rejected him, you have reason to set the record straight.

The reason there\u2019s still so much bullying is that bullies are given a pass and their victims are expected to just gloss over their own pain and trauma, and not to rock the boat.

Your bully and their friends are experiencing the consequences of their actions. You had every right to say no to his promposal and to not tell anyone why. Because lets be real. It wasn\u2019t practically stalking he WAS stalking you. Stealing your hair, your phone number and following your dad\u2019s car to where you live are beyond just highschool bullying.\n\nThose friends that are pissed that you disclosed this info are only mad because they know they are just as guilty assholes as your bully for enabling him. This is textbook rape culture. \n\nFocus on your life and safety OP!", "NTA\nYou are not required to keep an abuser's behavior secret to protect them. If his behavior makes him look horrible, he has only himself to blame.", "NTA. You didn't air his dirty laundry, you told the truth about something that happened to you. This is and was your business to share with whomever you please. If he didn't want it to come out this way, he should've told them himself in the ten years since this all took place...or better yet, never bullied you in the first place.", "NTA. This is an unprecedented turn of events over teenage drama of 10 years ago. It feels like you're the only one who left High School, it's so weird.\n\nAnd why he was deserving of sympathy back then?

If you don't want the behavior to get out, don't do it.", "Nope nope nope NTA. He should\u2019ve been prosecuted for what he did, what you describe is very serious. \n\nWhy would you protect him by staying silent?

They are idiots if they hear all that and take his side. At least his parents are on your side and to be fair if he is that creepy then it is no wonder he hasn't dated anyone, no one wants that level of shade.", "So, I had a similar experience. A guy followed me and harassed me for years under the guise of asking me out. It was horrible. And during the Height of Me Too he friended me on FB and I wrote him a long message saying, the fact that I didn\u2019t like you back is not excuse for how you treated me and you can\u2019t seriously be this dense. I actually got back a very nice and sincere apology. I was shocked. But I\u2019m glad I stood up for myself and you should be too.

I found him to be very obsessive over this back in the day, and hearing this made me think he hasn\u2019t changed much.

If he\u2019s allowed a high school rejection to impact his entire life then there was an underlying mental health issue before you rejected him. By 10 years after high school I definitely did not care about who had gone to dances with who or who was mean or whatnot. We all grow up and change and hopefully many of the bullies recognized the error of their ways too. You\u2019re NTA but maybe your friends are for even still caring about petty high school stuff (you weren\u2019t petty).", "NTA. Another reason why \u201cpromposals\u201d are creepy and disgusting.", "NTA. That the world now thinks telling the truth is wrong makes me very sad. You told an actual truth not a \u201cmy opinion\u201d truth. You told specific, real events that happened that he was lying about. If his life is ruined, he did it to himself. If he had been honest with people from the get go as to why you refused him (and he knows exactly why you refused), then they wouldn\u2019t be mad at him now. They are mad because he lied. And his lies were very serious. His mental health isn\u2019t your problem it\u2019s his. You did nothing more than react to how he treated you. In elementary I had a kid that used to say I was breaking his heart. I realized years later he probably had a crush on me. Difference was he didn\u2019t bully me first. He would spout out a few lines from a popular song in the US about a \u201cman eater\u201d, I don\u2019t know the name of the song but it was from the 50\u2019s or 60\u2019s oldies. But him doing it wasn\u2019t to be mean, I didn\u2019t take it badly but not seriously either. That was innocent. That guy was a straight up bully. My probable crush complimented me. Yours insulted you. So much different. Never feel bad for telling the truth. It\u2019s not the truth that ruins lives, it\u2019s the lies that they are exposing that ruins lives.", "Its not cancel culture its consequence culture. NTA for telling the truth.", "NTA.

This screams mental problem and I need therapy and help so I can live my life. They all seemed to think you just ruined his whole life?  Talk about being stuck in a positive feedback loop or whatever it\u2019s called.
