Towards the end of our final year of school, when we turn 18, our schools organise something called a Formal, which I suppose is a bit like a prom without the romantic aspects as you\u2019re not expected to go with anybody, and the idea of promposals generally isn\u2019t something that\u2019s done here.\n\nNearly 10 years ago, as I was preparing to leave school, I found out that, not only did a boy in my class have a massive crush on me for years, but he was planning one of these massive \u201cpromposals\u201d that are often done at proms. He had always been a horrendous bully to me. He would go from calling me hideous and claiming that I would die alone and unloved, to stealing my friend\u2019s phone to get my number, or sneaking up behind me and cutting out strands of my hair that to keep, or going so far as to find my house through my father\u2019s distinctive car.\n\nNaturally, when the day for his \u201cpromposal\u201d came along, he came out with his sign in front of the entire school, and I bluntly said no and walked away. I don\u2019t like confrontation or arguments, but I had no intention of sparing his feelings after all he had done, and I was honestly just uncomfortable and wanted to leave. He badgered me until the day I left school for turning him down and being heartless. His friends did the same. I didn\u2019t care.\n\nI recently met one of his old friends in my old town. I went to the business where one of them was working, and he kept bringing this up, saying that my bully had gotten depressed after we left school and hadn\u2019t dated at all because he was embarrassed from the rejection and was still hung up over me. He kept asking me why I felt it was OK to reject him like that over some nasty words, and if I was really that petty. I got sick of it, so I told him. Turns out that, because all of these creepy things had happened within the classroom, he hadn\u2019t seen them, or even heard of them happening. His friends and my other bullies within the class were covering for him. The friend abruptly left without a word, but apparently, the gossip did the rounds.\n\nNow, the friend group is divided in two. Many of those who didn\u2019t know are pissed at him for lying, and pissed that their other friends hid what was happening as they think it went too far. The others are pissed at me for airing his dirty laundry. His parents apparently also know now, and they\u2019re pissed that he had their sympathy through lies, and now know that he practically stalked me, which brings up questions about whether they want him to take over the small farm vs a younger brother. I wonder if I should have just let his friend be mad at me. I\u2019d probably have never seen him again, anyway. I didn\u2019t know that he would tell anyone as he\u2019d never been one for gossip that I knew of, but I also didn\u2019t expect this to potentially ruin the life of someone I haven\u2019t seen for nearly a decade.\n\nAITA for telling his friend the truth about what happened?", "created_utc": 1685451939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vpt4z/aita_for_revealing_why_i_rejected_a_promposal/", "score": 3354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He opened himself up to public rejection by making the \"promposal\" public in the first place.\n2) So for all these years did these people only consider \"yes\" an appropriate response from you? You don't owe anyone a date whatever level of bullying, be it nasty words or full on stalking, indifference or friendliness.\n\nLike the rest doesn't even have to be addressed, they're all weird for carrying this grudge in the first place and acting like there's nothing wrong with him being upset about it years later.", "NTA why take the blame because he was a bully that turned to a stalker", "NTA-  the friend had no place harassing you and  confronting/pressuring/guilt tripping you about something that did not involve them 10 YEARS ago.

Wow. So NTA.", "It is weird that they expect you to accept his promposal. You were not lovers or boyfriend and girlfriend, you didn't hang out, etc. You were even not friends.

You told everyone the truth about what he put you through. When other people give you grief about his mental health because you rightly rejected him, you have reason to set the record straight.

The reason there\u2019s still so much bullying is that bullies are given a pass and their victims are expected to just gloss over their own pain and trauma, and not to rock the boat.

Your bully and their friends are experiencing the consequences of their actions. You had every right to say no to his promposal and to not tell anyone why. Because lets be real. It wasn\u2019t practically stalking he WAS stalking you. Stealing your hair, your phone number and following your dad\u2019s car to where you live are beyond just highschool bullying.\n\nThose friends that are pissed that you disclosed this info are only mad because they know they are just as guilty assholes as your bully for enabling him. This is textbook rape culture. \n\nFocus on your life and safety OP!", "NTA\nYou are not required to keep an abuser's behavior secret to protect them. If his behavior makes him look horrible, he has only himself to blame.", "NTA. You didn't air his dirty laundry, you told the truth about something that happened to you. This is and was your business to share with whomever you please. If he didn't want it to come out this way, he should've told them himself in the ten years since this all took place...or better yet, never bullied you in the first place.", "NTA. This is an unprecedented turn of events over teenage drama of 10 years ago. It feels like you're the only one who left High School, it's so weird.\n\nAnd why he was deserving of sympathy back then?

If you don't want the behavior to get out, don't do it.", "Nope nope nope NTA. He should\u2019ve been prosecuted for what he did, what you describe is very serious. \n\nWhy would you protect him by staying silent?

A guy followed me and harassed me for years under the guise of asking me out. It was horrible. And during the Height of Me Too he friended me on FB and I wrote him a long message saying, the fact that I didn\u2019t like you back is not excuse for how you treated me and you can\u2019t seriously be this dense. I actually got back a very nice and sincere apology. I was shocked. But I\u2019m glad I stood up for myself and you should be too.

You told an actual truth not a \u201cmy opinion\u201d truth. You told specific, real events that happened that he was lying about. If his life is ruined, he did it to himself. If he had been honest with people from the get go as to why you refused him (and he knows exactly why you refused), then they wouldn\u2019t be mad at him now. They are mad because he lied. And his lies were very serious. His mental health isn\u2019t your problem it\u2019s his. You did nothing more than react to how he treated you. In elementary I had a kid that used to say I was breaking his heart. I realized years later he probably had a crush on me. Difference was he didn\u2019t bully me first. He would spout out a few lines from a popular song in the US about a \u201cman eater\u201d, I don\u2019t know the name of the song but it was from the 50\u2019s or 60\u2019s oldies. But him doing it wasn\u2019t to be mean, I didn\u2019t take it badly but not seriously either. That was innocent. That guy was a straight up bully. My probable crush complimented me. Yours insulted you. So much different. Never feel bad for telling the truth.

This screams mental problem and I need therapy and help so I can live my life. They all seemed to think you just ruined his whole life?

Even if he didn\u2019t do those things that still doesn\u2019t mean you had to go to the dance with him. Like his feelings some how override yours. Ridiculous! He spread lies about you and people expecting you just roll with it is unbelievable. He was/is a shitty person the fact that he still according to his friend still hung up on you is alarming.", "NTA. Justice is blind, but comes around. It only takes a little while sometimes because it cannot see so well. \n\nHarvest time.", "NTA. His chickens are coming home to roost.. on the small farm to be passed on to his brother", ">He kept asking me why I felt it was OK to reject him like that\n\nGod all these people are exhausting.

Thankfully it seems they've gone away. But the whole point of big public gestures like this, for prom or marriage, is to put the other person on the spot and force them to say yes because if they don't everyone thinks they're heartless and the person being proposed to is embarrassed.", "Oooooh good one.", "Exactly, regardless of the bullying. This person is allowed to say no. It\u2019s quite disturbing that they people are holding on to this so many years later.", "Saw it on a different AITA post and thought it was good too :P  toxic people hate being called out on their shit", "Path of least resistance. People figured that since they're already bullied anyway, they must not have enough spine to push back, and these people can get their \"goody points\" for keeping the peace without putting much effort.

It shows you clearly who you need to get out of your life, however.", "Everything you said. So sick of the idea that men/boys are entitled to a date with any woman/girl they ask.\n\nLike that story about a month ago that a kid made a public \"promposal\" and the girl said no, and everyone rallied around the poor devastated boy because how dare she publicly humiliate him like that?!?!?!!!\n\nI can't stand the big public whoopdeedoo proposals of marriage, much less for a prom!", "Ten years, and he's still acting like a baby because you shot him down?\n\n\"Ah, yes, I've been tormenting OP for years, telling her she'll be alone, no one wants her, she'll never have anyone. Clearly, I've broken her enough she'll LEAP at the chance to prove me wrong!\" Dumbass. He REALLY thought he had a chance with his victim!\n\nNTA, and it's absolutely hilarious that he's been single, alone, unwanted ever since then, much like he claimed you would be. Live your best life, and have nothing to do with him! He brought this upon himself!", "Hell to the no, NTA. This guy seems like an obsessive creep who needs to get his shit together and go to therapy. Bullying you and being an ass at you because he had a crush on you? Toddlers do that!! This asshole was 18!!\nAnd I\u2019m really not one to blame people for their mental health, but honestly, whatever he did with his life for 10 years, never getting over it, never dating, that had to be his choice, you\u2019re not responsible for what happens to him. Don\u2019t give a shit about what people think of you for what you did, what he did to you was unjustifiable, those who defend him don\u2019t deserve your shits", "NTA!

If people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better.\"\nAnne Lamott, Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life\n\nPeople who have behaved badly need consequences for their actions. If your bully had come to you and apologized for what he did back in school, maybe I would have some sympathy for him. But he's apparently unrepentant. And now he and his friends are blaming you because he's having to face consequences for being a bully, a creep, and a stalker. This is a **very bad guy.**\n\nNTA and tell the \"friends\" who are mad at you for airing his \"dirty laundry\" that his laundry isn't just dirty, it's made up of criminal acts and that they are enabling a creep.", "That is not the way adults react to stories from 10 years ago", "Nta. Your bully doesn't get to write the narrative and perpetuate his bullying by enlisting others. You have no obligation to lie to protect his reputation especially at the cost of your own and you are entitled to speak your truth.

His dirty laundry is his problem you arent his laundress.", "NTA people like that need to learn some accountability for themselves.", "OP, if he'd changed at all in the last decade, when all this came out, he would say something \"yeah, I treated OP really badly.

I needed to grow up and do better, and I think that I've done that, but it makes total sense that's how she remembers me.\"", "That is not the way adults react to stories from 10 years ago, it's weird that anyone would have an opinion about this to discuss it at all let alone have a group divide.\n\nStop talking to your friends from 10 years ago, they act like 17 year olds", "NTA.

The bully's friend was completely out of line to accost you in that way and berate you. You were there to conduct business and his behavior was inappropriate. Since he wouldn't drop the subject, I don't blame you for laying out your reasons for refusing his buddy. You also would have been within your rights to speak to his manager about his unprofessional behavior toward you.\n\nIt is not your fault your bully has lied about this episode for the past 10 years. You also are not to blame for his apparently pathetic life. \n\nPlease don't worry about what people are saying. You have moved on; good for you.\n\nP.S. He didn't \"practically\" stalk you.
