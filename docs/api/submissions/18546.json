Towards the end of our final year of school, when we turn 18, our schools organise something called a Formal, which I suppose is a bit like a prom without the romantic aspects as you\u2019re not expected to go with anybody, and the idea of promposals generally isn\u2019t something that\u2019s done here.\n\nNearly 10 years ago, as I was preparing to leave school, I found out that, not only did a boy in my class have a massive crush on me for years, but he was planning one of these massive \u201cpromposals\u201d that are often done at proms. He had always been a horrendous bully to me. He would go from calling me hideous and claiming that I would die alone and unloved, to stealing my friend\u2019s phone to get my number, or sneaking up behind me and cutting out strands of my hair that to keep, or going so far as to find my house through my father\u2019s distinctive car.\n\nNaturally, when the day for his \u201cpromposal\u201d came along, he came out with his sign in front of the entire school, and I bluntly said no and walked away. I don\u2019t like confrontation or arguments, but I had no intention of sparing his feelings after all he had done, and I was honestly just uncomfortable and wanted to leave. He badgered me until the day I left school for turning him down and being heartless. His friends did the same. I didn\u2019t care.\n\nI recently met one of his old friends in my old town. I went to the business where one of them was working, and he kept bringing this up, saying that my bully had gotten depressed after we left school and hadn\u2019t dated at all because he was embarrassed from the rejection and was still hung up over me. He kept asking me why I felt it was OK to reject him like that over some nasty words, and if I was really that petty. I got sick of it, so I told him. Turns out that, because all of these creepy things had happened within the classroom, he hadn\u2019t seen them, or even heard of them happening. His friends and my other bullies within the class were covering for him. The friend abruptly left without a word, but apparently, the gossip did the rounds.\n\nNow, the friend group is divided in two. Many of those who didn\u2019t know are pissed at him for lying, and pissed that their other friends hid what was happening as they think it went too far. The others are pissed at me for airing his dirty laundry. His parents apparently also know now, and they\u2019re pissed that he had their sympathy through lies, and now know that he practically stalked me, which brings up questions about whether they want him to take over the small farm vs a younger brother. I wonder if I should have just let his friend be mad at me. I\u2019d probably have never seen him again, anyway. I didn\u2019t know that he would tell anyone as he\u2019d never been one for gossip that I knew of, but I also didn\u2019t expect this to potentially ruin the life of someone I haven\u2019t seen for nearly a decade.\n\nAITA for telling his friend the truth about what happened?", "created_utc": 1685451939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vpt4z/aita_for_revealing_why_i_rejected_a_promposal/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let them be.  You didn't dirty the laundry, you're just refusing to white wash it.  Dude was a stalker and a bully.  Now everyone knows the truth.  NTA", "NTA were you expected to lie for someone who made your life hell for years? How could possibly have known that everyone would find out.. and even if you did that's changes nothing. He chose to do what he did all those years ago and now he's getting found out for being a creep and a bully and lying to all his friends and that's somehow your fault? I don't think so.", "NTA   \n\n\nHe bullied you and you gave a simple no.  \n\n\nHis reaction to it is all on him, but this reeks of self importance and if you haven't seen him in a decade, why care?  \nHe isn't part of your life.", "I mean it just seems mad that this high school drama is getting brought up all these years later, but in any case he is reaping what he sowed by being a bully all those years ago so NTA", "NTA and don't spend a second feeling guilty about this. You did absolutely nothing wrong, at any point in this story. It wasn't YOUR fault you were bullied. It wasn't YOUR fault someone asked you to prom and couldn't handle the rejection when you said no. And it also wasn't YOUR fault that people have been gossiping about old hurts. You were asked by his old friend what the deal was, you were honest. That's it.\n\nIf this guy's life is ruined, it's of his own making. You go about your own business and don't feel guilty.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to lie for the guy who stalked and harassed you. All you did was answer the question honestly. His behavior before and after (including continuing to lie to friends and family) was his choice and his responsibility. These are the consequences of his actions.", "NTA.  The friend kept bringing up something from 10 years ago. You have 0 oblogation to go out with someone who bullied you. Since the guy seems to *still* be caught up on it and never tried apologizing id say you dodged a bullet", "NTA - You answered his question honestly. It\u2019s not your fault that the truth paints your bully in a bad light.", "NTA. I've heard of little boys teasing and bullying girls they like because they don't know how to process their feelings, but you're talking about a teenager who apparently became a lying and manipulative adult who's surrounded himself with similarly immature friends. It sounds like the dude needs psychiatric help, and it sounds like the friend who confronted you about it needs to get a life.", "It's been ten years and he's still not over it? Not your problem. Move on buddy, there are other fish in the sea as they say. \n\nNTA. Let it be known karma is a jerk and everyone who deserves it gets it.", "NTA.\n\nHe sowed the wind and reaped the whirlwind, which is a prettier way to say he fucked around and found out. He treated you horribly and then lied about it to others. He deserves to have people find out what he did and how he lied. Those are the consequences he has to grow up and deal with now.", "NTA: You did nothing wrong then and you've done nothing wrong now.", "You are never in the wrong for being honest.  That being said, it\u2019s been 10 years and there\u2019s little to be gained from all this.\n\nNTA leaning NAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
