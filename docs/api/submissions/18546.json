Towards the end of our final year of school, when we turn 18, our schools organise something called a Formal, which I suppose is a bit like a prom without the romantic aspects as you\u2019re not expected to go with anybody, and the idea of promposals generally isn\u2019t something that\u2019s done here.\n\nNearly 10 years ago, as I was preparing to leave school, I found out that, not only did a boy in my class have a massive crush on me for years, but he was planning one of these massive \u201cpromposals\u201d that are often done at proms. He had always been a horrendous bully to me. He would go from calling me hideous and claiming that I would die alone and unloved, to stealing my friend\u2019s phone to get my number, or sneaking up behind me and cutting out strands of my hair that to keep, or going so far as to find my house through my father\u2019s distinctive car.\n\nNaturally, when the day for his \u201cpromposal\u201d came along, he came out with his sign in front of the entire school, and I bluntly said no and walked away. I don\u2019t like confrontation or arguments, but I had no intention of sparing his feelings after all he had done, and I was honestly just uncomfortable and wanted to leave. He badgered me until the day I left school for turning him down and being heartless. His friends did the same. I didn\u2019t care.\n\nI recently met one of his old friends in my old town. I went to the business where one of them was working, and he kept bringing this up, saying that my bully had gotten depressed after we left school and hadn\u2019t dated at all because he was embarrassed from the rejection and was still hung up over me. He kept asking me why I felt it was OK to reject him like that over some nasty words, and if I was really that petty. I got sick of it, so I told him. Turns out that, because all of these creepy things had happened within the classroom, he hadn\u2019t seen them, or even heard of them happening. His friends and my other bullies within the class were covering for him. The friend abruptly left without a word, but apparently, the gossip did the rounds.\n\nNow, the friend group is divided in two. Many of those who didn\u2019t know are pissed at him for lying, and pissed that their other friends hid what was happening as they think it went too far. The others are pissed at me for airing his dirty laundry. His parents apparently also know now, and they\u2019re pissed that he had their sympathy through lies, and now know that he practically stalked me, which brings up questions about whether they want him to take over the small farm vs a younger brother. I wonder if I should have just let his friend be mad at me. I\u2019d probably have never seen him again, anyway. I didn\u2019t know that he would tell anyone as he\u2019d never been one for gossip that I knew of, but I also didn\u2019t expect this to potentially ruin the life of someone I haven\u2019t seen for nearly a decade.\n\nAITA for telling his friend the truth about what happened?", "created_utc": 1685451939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vpt4z/aita_for_revealing_why_i_rejected_a_promposal/", "score": 192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's it.\n\nIf this guy's life is ruined, it's of his own making. You go about your own business and don't feel guilty.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to lie for the guy who stalked and harassed you. All you did was answer the question honestly.

The friend kept bringing up something from 10 years ago. You have 0 oblogation to go out with someone who bullied you.

It\u2019s not your fault that the truth paints your bully in a bad light.", "NTA. I've heard of little boys teasing and bullying girls they like because they don't know how to process their feelings, but you're talking about a teenager who apparently became a lying and manipulative adult who's surrounded himself with similarly immature friends.

Let it be known karma is a jerk and everyone who deserves it gets it.", "NTA.\n\nHe sowed the wind and reaped the whirlwind, which is a prettier way to say he fucked around and found out. He treated you horribly and then lied about it to others. He deserves to have people find out what he did and how he lied. Those are the consequences he has to grow up and deal with now.", "NTA: You did nothing wrong then and you've done nothing wrong now.", "You are never in the wrong for being honest.

I get to some people it might be a big deal but if it was so significant then they should have gotten therapy, not tried to hold onto that drama for so long.", "NTA, it's your life, you can explain it to whoever you want. If he didn't want it to be know he shouldn't have been a creep. You didn't ruin anyone's life. His lies and creepiness just caught up to him.", "NTA. This is too much flipping drama for something a decade ago. His parents decisions do not stem from his promposal, but a lifetime of failures. Block all this BS from your life or get off social media. JHC", " *He kept asking me why I felt it was OK to reject him like that over some nasty words, and if I was really that petty.* \n\nFirst, why does he care?

To the extent that you were apparently responsible for ruining his life and his parents sympathised with him for 10 years???\n\nTeenage girls are not the property of any teenage boy who asks for them", "NTA. Where was this collective effort of sparing feelings when he was bullying you? You do not have to lie for anybody, and especially not for your high-school bully.", "NTA\nEven if he was the nicest guy in the world you were under no obligation to accept. His friends had no right to bully you with guilt", "NTA \n\n\"He kept asking if I felt it was okay to reject him like that over some nasty words.\"\n\n1) You weren't even harsh, you just said no. He opened himself up to public rejection by making the \"promposal\" public in the first place.\n2) So for all these years did these people only consider \"yes\" an appropriate response from you? You don't owe anyone a date whatever level of bullying, be it nasty words or full on stalking, indifference or friendliness.\n\nLike the rest doesn't even have to be addressed, they're all weird for carrying this grudge in the first place and acting like there's nothing wrong with him being upset about it years later.", "NTA why take the blame because he was a bully that turned to a stalker", "NTA-  the friend had no place harassing you and  confronting/pressuring/guilt tripping you about something that did not involve them 10 YEARS ago.  I'd report them.   \n\"Hi manager, my high school stalkers friend xxx came up to me while working and attempted to guilt trip me for not going to prom with his friend 10 years ago, now I'm being harassed by his friends.\"\n\nYou only aired dirt after that occurred.

You are little hero here ;) NTA", "Uh, if he's still hung up on you and hasn't dated anyone in ten years, I think it's quite possible you'll see him again. Keep any social media accounts you have locked down to private and don't accept follow requests from people you don't know. Put cameras around your home. He was and is an obsessive stalker. You were right to tell the truth. He lied about you this whole time to make you look bad. NTA", "You don\u2019t owe him your silence. It\u2019s not like you drove to his parents\u2019 home and forced them to listen to your story. You were honest about what happened to you when someone who obviously wanted to know kept bringing it up (rudely IMO but that\u2019s not relevant). You did nothing wrong; indeed, you didn\u2019t really do much at all. \n\nNTA, ignore his defenders. They\u2019re just embarrassed that now people are aware they enabled or participated in horrible behavior", "NTA. He was a bully and a stalker and a creep and you are 100% entitled to speak about event that have  happened to you. That isn't even gossip.", "Friend asked, you answered. They should've thought about that before. Not your problem what happens as a result. It's not like you went out of your way to ruin his reputation.", "So let me get this straight. Victim of stalking and harassment gets told off a decade later for rejecting her stalker, explains the real situation and then gets told by her friends that she should have kept quiet for the sake of her harasser? Wow. So NTA.", "It is weird that they expect you to accept his promposal. You were not lovers or boyfriend and girlfriend, you didn't hang out, etc. You were even not friends. So, it is very normal for you to reject, even if there were no bullying. Do they really think that you should marry someone you don't like, just because he is a \"good\" guy JUST after high school? Of course, NTA for so many reasons.", "NTA. Does his old friend realized he bullied you into telling him the truth? Parents of bullies like to say: they'll grow out of it. Old friend didn't did he?", "NTA the guy kept pestering you about it until you were forced to shut him down with the truth about his friend. And who are these weirdos that still think about high school formal 10 years later?", "NTA\n\nWow, the LAYERS of misogyny here.\n\nEven if he\u2019d done nothing to you, it\u2019s okay to tell someone no when they ask you out.\n\nYou aren\u2019t responsible for their mental health. They have to learn to handle rejection.\n\nYou also shouldn\u2019t be expected to keep how badly someone treated you secret to protect their reputation.\n\nGood on that other guy for not hiding how awful that person is. You didn\u2019t ruin his life, his past behavior has finally just caught up with him.\n\nAnd that some folks didn\u2019t know? He hid it from them because he knew what he was doing was fucked up. (Also consider how this dude was still hung up after 10 years, he certainly had no problem trying to wrongly smear your reputation to the point where one of his friends was harrassing you about it.)", "Absolutely epic, YTA", "NTA. You just outed a stalker who acted a victim and manipulated his family and others. Let the stalker worry about his behavior.", "If he didn't want this to happen he shouldn't have bullied you", "NTA.  OP did nothing but tell the truth about a creepy bully.  More importantly, this was nearly a decade ago!  Has nothing gone in their lives since then that they're still hanging onto HS drama that didn't even directly involve them?  Just go on with your life OP and forget these people.", "NTA. You told everyone the truth about what he put you through. When other people give you grief about his mental health because you rightly rejected him, you have reason to set the record straight. He's only mad because he got away with the lie for 10 years.", "NTA. At all. You didn\u2019t bring this up - the friend did. You didn\u2019t cause all the problems and trauma - the bully did. The reason there\u2019s still so much bullying is that bullies are given a pass and their victims are expected to just gloss over their own pain and trauma, and not to rock the boat. Bullies should be made deeply uncomfortable, it holds them to account for their actions.\n\nOP, I hope you find better people to associate with. No one should be stuck dealing with this drama train.", "NTA", "NTA, hun if they\u2019re still bringing it up and getting upset at you over it that means you have every right to air out what he did", "If you told the truth. YTA. These are the consequences of HIS actions.", "NTA\nhe asked , you answered.\nHe spilled the bill, not you.\nThose against you are the ones who are accomplices of his misbehiors.cickroaches don't like you to take up the stones they are under.\n\nAnd all in all, thus is the long due aftermath of bully's actions.", "NTA. Your bully and their friends are experiencing the consequences of their actions. You had every right to say no to his promposal and to not tell anyone why. Because lets be real. It wasn\u2019t practically stalking he WAS stalking you. Stealing your hair, your phone number and following your dad\u2019s car to where you live are beyond just highschool bullying.\n\nThose friends that are pissed that you disclosed this info are only mad because they know they are just as guilty assholes as your bully for enabling him. This is textbook rape culture. \n\nFocus on your life and safety OP!", "NTA\nYou are not required to keep an abuser's behavior secret to protect them. If his behavior makes him look horrible, he has only himself to blame.", "NTA. You didn't air his dirty laundry, you told the truth about something that happened to you. This is and was your business to share with whomever you please. If he didn't want it to come out this way, he should've told them himself in the ten years since this all took place...or better yet, never bullied you in the first place.", "NTA. This is an unprecedented turn of events over teenage drama of 10 years ago. It feels like you're the only one who left High School, it's so weird.\n\nAnd why he was deserving of sympathy back then? For being rejected? That's it? As if you had the obligation to accept his feelings. I'm not even taking the bullying into account.", "NTA.. F* these people", "NTA. If you don't want the behavior to get out, don't do it.", "Nope nope nope NTA. He should\u2019ve been prosecuted for what he did, what you describe is very serious. \n\nWhy would you protect him by staying silent? Those friends of his are just like him.", "Clearly Old Bully, Old Bully Friends, and Old Town have some serious issues with toxic male role modeling.  Shout the truth as loud as you can -- if nothing else, for the sake of future generations to learn from and do better.  NTA", "NTA, you have no obligation to give in to their pressure and harassment, if anything I would get a restraining order for the deep levels of creepy shit he pulled. They are idiots if they hear all that and take his side. At least his parents are on your side and to be fair if he is that creepy then it is no wonder he hasn't dated anyone, no one wants that level of shade.", "So, I had a similar experience. A guy followed me and harassed me for years under the guise of asking me out. It was horrible. And during the Height of Me Too he friended me on FB and I wrote him a long message saying, the fact that I didn\u2019t like you back is not excuse for how you treated me and you can\u2019t seriously be this dense. I actually got back a very nice and sincere apology. I was shocked. But I\u2019m glad I stood up for myself and you should be too. His delicate bully feelings and the consequences of his behavior are his responsibility.

I found him to be very obsessive over this back in the day, and hearing this made me think he hasn\u2019t changed much. Then again, I don\u2019t actually know his current mental state and I don\u2019t really plan on finding out.", " NTA He was and is an obsessive stalker. You were right to tell the truth.
