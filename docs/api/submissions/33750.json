She\u2019s polite, reserved, and VERY sheltered to the point where she gasped when she saw there were condom dispensers in the hall. I often worry that I\u2019m \u2018trampling\u2019 over her politeness with my more assertive attitude. \n\n\nThe weekend I left for winter break she decided to visit family friends for a couple nights, meaning she\u2019d be gone Friday and Saturday night and get back on Sunday. With this knowledge I decided to invite my fwb over. We fucked, cuddled, and then I kicked him out because two people cannot fit in a twin xl and that mf snores. The next night (Sunday) I was packing for home and talking to a friend on the phone and mentioned the previous night\u2019s encounter and joked about how \u2018my stuffed animals were traumatized\u2019.  A couple days later I get a text from my roommate that I\u2019ve copy and pasted below: \n\n\n\u201cHi :) Sry to bother you over break! I know we  talked about allowing friends in the room before but we did not talk about having boyfriends over and I would rly appreciate it if you don\u2019t have sex in the room as it is my space too. Merry Christmas!\u201d \n\n\nWhile I understand some people aren\u2019t comfortable with the topic of sex at all and we shouldn\u2019t judge them for that, I gotta be honest in that I am judging her for THIS. There has never been a time where I asked her to leave/stay out so I could have sex and I wouldn\u2019t ever DREAM of being that gross roommate who brings a partner back while their roomie is sleeping. I also know that sex can have a smell so I made sure to burn our agreed upon scented candle.  \n\n\nI texted back that while I understand she\u2019s uncomfortable with it I\u2019m not breaking any rules that could get us in trouble, not doing anything that affects her belongings, and it\u2019s my room as much as her room meaning we can\u2019t just ban activities the other deems \u2018bad\u2019 unilaterally. I reassured her that I wouldn\u2019t ever kick her out for sex or make her an unwilling witness. All she texted back was that she is willing to discuss this with an RA present when we get back from break. \n\nI think it\u2019s completely ridiculous and entitled that she wants to control my actions that she deems \u201cbad\u201d when it\u2019s both my room too and she isn\u2019t even there. However I\u2019m also wondering if I\u2019m both breaking some sort of roommate code about sex and making her uncomfortable by forcing sex into her life and thus being an asshole.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve actually already put in a roommate transfer request due to her sleep yelling, but according to the housing office my request is \u2018low ranking\u2019 due to the problem being solvable (I\u2019ve tried 7+ brands of earplugs and headphones\u2026 it is not solvable) so at this point I\u2019m just trying to make it work with what I have.

The RA will either find this to be comedically ridiculous and let your roommate know their position is such, or they will say to you \"can you compromise on this?\" to which you should say \"no\" and the RA will tell your roommate \"nothing is against school policy/law, can't help here. Just be considerate\"", "NAH - she was away, you didn\u2019t have sex on her bed and your FWB didn\u2019t steal all her stuff. If one roommate is away, it\u2019s the perfect time for the other to get some action.\n\nHowever, she\u2019s allowed to have her own feelings about sex. This isn\u2019t a BF, this is a FWB. If she\u2019s from a super conservative/religious upbringing, that\u2019s going to be hard for her to reconcile in her personal space.\n\nThe whole sharing a bedroom with a stranger concept is weird. I did it too, I had a roommate when I was at uni, but it\u2019s hella weird. Bedrooms should be very personal, safe spaces, and they\u2019re never going to be when you\u2019re living with a random person you met on day one of orientation.\n\nIf you can, I suggest you go to your FWB\u2019s place whilst applying for that transfer. Might be worth trying to bolster that transfer application with more irreconcilable differences. You both deserve to feel more comfortable in your own second homes.

Yes, your allowed to have sex all you want, but you SHARE A ROOM with this girl. You are having sex in HER room too. Its not just your room, so should at least be considerate of your roommates feelings.\n\n Its perfectly reasonable for her to be uncomfortable with it, especially considering her culture could view things differently. It doesnt means shes \"sheltered\". I'd vote differently if she was demanding you stop or being mean about it, but she was being polite about it and expressed how she felt and was even willing to talk with an RA present in hopes of coming to an agreement. Yet you pretty much shut that down and didnt even want to work with her at all.\n\nAnd now your claiming shes \"entitled\" for not wanting you to have sex in your SHARED room, and that shes \"controlling your actions\". Yet, your completely disregarding her feelings and acting as if your feelings are more important than hers.\n\nYou already know you are making her uncomfortable. Even if you had sex on your side of the room, she would still feel disgusted/uncomfortable that it happened in the same room as all her stuff too.\n\n Why cant you go to our FWB's room or something?

In fact you are the one attacking her up bringing and sex boundary. \n\nShe can't unilaterally ban something, but you can unilaterally overrule her and do whatever you want. See the issue.   \n\nShe is going to speak to the RA to get a new dorm assignment. She has no voice or rights dorming with you, so no reason to stay.", "How did she find out if she was away? \n\nYou discussed it with a friend on the phone but how did your room-mate know anything about it?", "I think it's important not to forget that she's from a completely different culture. It's entirely possible that she's been raised to believe that premarital sex is bad, and that would be a very uncomfortable situation for her to be in. Have you ever talked to her about what would happen if you wanted to have your FWB over when she wasn't gone for a period of time? It doesn't sound as though there would be any solution that would be acceptable to her. \n\nIt sounds as though your lifestyles and beliefs are not at all compatible. I imagine she's as eager to get a different roommate as you are, and I hope the university helps you achieve that.", "I find this American set-up of housemates sharing a sleeping room so strange, in my country it's a basic assumption/right to have your own bedroom, and everything else is a shared space. I just couldn't do it.", "NTA! And this one is such a good AITA that I want an update lmfao", "NTA, provided you already agreed that having anyone over while the other person isn't in the room is OK.

She wasn\u2019t even there!", "YTA for the shitty description of the situation, you're using words to manipulate the votes by painting a very racist picture of your roommate.

I get where you're coming from, and her as well and I'm being even more understanding for her since she's from a different culture. And it's also her stuff in her room and I get if she may feel weird with people coming in and out who she may encounter once, if that. But, she also gotta understand that is the risk of living in dorms and if something did happen, is when she can complain.\n\nBut, it's not like you had sex while she was there or told her to leave (my first roommate kinda did that to me. About to go in my room and I couldn't she put some sign on the door and I did feel a certain way because uh, I paid for this room too and he you fuckin didn't nor did I really agree with this)", "NAH, however I do think this is a good, low stakes lesson in being careful who you trust. You're going to face situations as you navigate your adult life where you will unintentionally shoot yourself in the foot because you overshared with the wrong person. Just because your roommate is your roommate, it doesn't mean she's your friend and someone you should share everything with. This will apply to coworkers, lab partners, acquaintances, etc. \n\nIf you hadn't told her you were smashing it out in the room, she wouldn't know and there wouldn't be a problem. She's uncomfortable with the topic of sex, has lived a sheltered life and she is involving the RA in a matter that you both should've been able to navigate on your own. I'm also sure if you think about it long enough, there were other signs that this chick just does not pass the \"chill test.\"\n\nTake care in who you share details about your life with. The next time it won't be your roommate running to your RA, it'll be a coworker running to a boss, etc.", "NAH. Everyone has a right to their boundaries. She doesn\u2019t want her roommates bringing guys around. You want to be able to have sex in your own home. Unfortunately, this may mean you\u2019re incompatible as roommates.\n\nIf you\u2019re not breaking any sort of dorm or school rules, her going to the RA isn\u2019t much of a threat. In fact, it could be good to have a third party helping mediate. It\u2019ll also be good, if this turns out to be a breaking point, to go ahead and get the complaints logged so you two can get different roommates. Worst case scenario, just dig your heels in and refuse to  accept any responsibility for wrongdoing \u2014 the RA is just another student and they usually can\u2019t do that much.", "Nta.

Yoko Ono singing?", "Fight her at the RA and show how ridiculous she sounds", "NTA. You\u2019ve broken no code, she\u2019s a prude and nosy AF. I think the correct response to her text would\u2019ve been to just completely ignore. It doesn\u2019t warrant a response, it sounds like you were more than respectful of her. The most polite thing to do is to offer a DADT arrangement wherein you agree to keep it discreet. But you certainly shouldn\u2019t agree to her encroachment on how you can use your own bed. If she insists on a meeting with RA, tell the truth, stand proud, and let her embarrass herself. They may opt to reassign one of you, consider that a blessing if they do.", "Nah, she doesn't get to make that kind of choice for you. Period. If she's gonna be obnoxious about it, just lie. If she confronts you, remind her she wasn't not in the room at the time and has no idea what you do in there. \n\nHer being a sheltered girl from a prudish country is not your problem. Welcome to the outside world, kid!", "YTA and you're the entitled one too. She feels uncomfortable knowing you have sex in her living space, why can't you have sex elsewhere ? Like in your bf room, for example?", "nta shes a prude and for some reason thinks her feelings are way more important than yours, even when you were going out of your way to be extremely considerate to her", "NTA,\n\nShe literally isn\u2019t even in the room, you could have sex in there all year round and she wouldn\u2019t even know unless you told her", "NTA. Entering into a shared living arrangement with another adult assumes that you will be living in a space where that other adult will be conducting normal facets of human life in the space. If a rented living space is going to depart from what is typically entailed in a living space, that must be established ahead of moving in.\n\nAs no such provision has been made, you are entitled to the expectation that the space you are paying to live in can be used for the expected activities of daily life. Asking you to refrain from sexual activity (or supporting your roommate in doing so) in a space that you are paying for as living space for an adult would be a clear dereliction of your dorm\u2019s duty to provide a functional useable living space to you.", "how she know", "NTA. People here seem to be forgetting that boundaries are for things that affect you, rules are what you impose on other people. \n\nI don\u2019t see how OP having sex in her own bed when her roommate is away AND burning a candle to remove the scent affects her roommate in any meaningful way beyond offending her sensibilities. \n\nIf her roommate is so uncomfortable with the idea of sex occurring on college campus then she can buck up the cash for private, offsite accommodation.", "NTA. \n\nI wonder if your roommate is getting the RA involved because she\u2019s hoping you will feel too embarrassed to fight her if she involves a perceived authority.  \n\nIf the meeting with the RA eventuates. just let roommate do the initial explanation. Don\u2019t make it easy on her and don\u2019t do the talking unless you need to. After her explanation of the problem, ask lots of clarifying questions like what exactly she is concerned about, why she feels uncomfortable about things you are doing when she\u2019s not there. Ask her what assurances she would need in order to feel comfortable. I think you\u2019re managing the situation well by not having your partner sleeping there, only doing it when you know she won\u2019t be returning home and by making sure her belongings aren\u2019t at risk. Show a willingness to compromise without backing down entirely. Don\u2019t defend your position, make her defend her position and put it into words. She has the problem, she needs to do the talking. \n\nI suspect this is a difference in values and I think it\u2019s important to get her to verbalise that, if that\u2019s the case. She might need to find someone likeminded to share a dorm with and awareness of her own values might be a good starting point for her. Be sure to validate her values for her, but remind her that you have different values and that is perfectly okay and reasonable and as roommates, you need to compromise.", "NAH This problem resolves itself.

I could understand from a safety perspective why she might be a bit upset (not wanting her things touched or stolen by some stranger she doesn't know in her room), but assuming you know this fwb well and for a while, then she's got no reason or standing to dictate to you what you do in your space in her absence. Anything she WOULD have the right to get upset about, you've already outlined you'd never do.", "NTA asking you to not have sex in your room when she isn't even in town is not reasonable.", "NTA - Maybe it is time to start talking about all the drunken nightclub bathroom sex and hope that both of you requesting a roommate swap moves you up the priority list.\n\nPeople are going to have sex in college/ university and while I get some people are more reserved as long as you are not trying to involve her or not bringing home guys drunk at 2 am while she is trying to sleep you are all good.", "NTA, it\u2019s reasonable to ask when they\u2019re also staying in the room, but when they\u2019re away they have no reason to know or care about what you get up with", "If you share a room with her, YTA.

This is definitely a topic that should've been discussed beforehand, but it's being discussed now, and that works. For now, just ride it out until your transfer request is approved and be careful who you talk to about your \"escapades.\" And maybe keep the sex in fwb's room.", "NTA, im not american but if went to an american college id be expecting sex in every room i walk into. Maybe ive seen to many movies/shows.", "Slight NTA. I'd have said None, but the going straight to the RA without trying to have any kind of conversation is really annoying and immature. She's also going to be a bit upset when the RA either completely ignores the situation or laughs about it. Hopefully this escalates the roommate transfer, but high priority transfers tend to be things like \"I got paired with a blatant bigot\" or \"my roommate is an active, literal thief.\"\n\n I do get where the discomfort is coming from though. It's pretty common for people with shared living situations in China to get a hotel if they want to hook up with somebody, especially if it's a shared room. Maybe if she doesn't want you hooking up in the room, even when she's gone, then she can get you a hotel room and transportation to and from\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nBut this just might be an irreconcilable difference.

I don\u2019t want to know someone I live with was being banged like a drum over the weekend. So maybe a don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell policy would be helpful.

She\u2019s polite, reserved, and VERY sheltered to the point where she gasped when she saw there were condom dispensers in the hall. I often worry that I\u2019m \u2018trampling\u2019 over her politeness with my more assertive attitude. \n\n\nThe weekend I left for winter break she decided to visit family friends for a couple nights, meaning she\u2019d be gone Friday and Saturday night and get back on Sunday. With this knowledge I decided to invite my fwb over. We fucked, cuddled, and then I kicked him out because two people cannot fit in a twin xl and that mf snores. The next night (Sunday) I was packing for home and talking to a friend on the phone and mentioned the previous night\u2019s encounter and joked about how \u2018my stuffed animals were traumatized\u2019.  A couple days later I get a text from my roommate that I\u2019ve copy and pasted below: \n\n\n\u201cHi :) Sry to bother you over break! I know we  talked about allowing friends in the room before but we did not talk about having boyfriends over and I would rly appreciate it if you don\u2019t have sex in the room as it is my space too. Merry Christmas!\u201d \n\n\nWhile I understand some people aren\u2019t comfortable with the topic of sex at all and we shouldn\u2019t judge them for that, I gotta be honest in that I am judging her for THIS. There has never been a time where I asked her to leave/stay out so I could have sex and I wouldn\u2019t ever DREAM of being that gross roommate who brings a partner back while their roomie is sleeping. I also know that sex can have a smell so I made sure to burn our agreed upon scented candle.  \n\n\nI texted back that while I understand she\u2019s uncomfortable with it I\u2019m not breaking any rules that could get us in trouble, not doing anything that affects her belongings, and it\u2019s my room as much as her room meaning we can\u2019t just ban activities the other deems \u2018bad\u2019 unilaterally. I reassured her that I wouldn\u2019t ever kick her out for sex or make her an unwilling witness. All she texted back was that she is willing to discuss this with an RA present when we get back from break. \n\nI think it\u2019s completely ridiculous and entitled that she wants to control my actions that she deems \u201cbad\u201d when it\u2019s both my room too and she isn\u2019t even there. However I\u2019m also wondering if I\u2019m both breaking some sort of roommate code about sex and making her uncomfortable by forcing sex into her life and thus being an asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA, but the thing that is weird to me is you had your encounter while she was gone, and she seemed to learn about it. I could be misreading this. Did she setup some kind of security camera and not inform you? To me that would be the bigger issue.\n\nI would generally say it's your right to do what you want with respect to your roommate while she's present, but you're not required to follow her rules, when she's not there (assuming you're still respecting her property rights by not touching her stuff)", "I know people are leaning towards the side of N/T/A because sex with practically no evidence in your dorm room is par for the course, and OP is definitely not TA for doing so. But I also understand how it feels to be so sex repulsed that you can't even stand the idea you're around sex. It can almost be an obsessive compulsion, which is probably why she could be so drastic about it. She could've been raised under Mormon-esque purity culture that deemed it a sin, have sexual trauma that causes repulsion, or she could just be sex repulsed from a natural lack of libido. Regardless of the cause, I think this is overall a NAH scenario, and I hope you guys can manage to switch roommates or find a compromise.", "Nta I just wouldn't tell her next time. It's not like you're doing it in her bed. As long as you're always with your guest to prevent theft I don't see the problem either.", "NTA I just can't get behind people who are against sex. There's no reason it should bother her, it doesn't directly affect her and she wouldn't even know it was going on if she wasn't present for the phone call. Stand your ground here.", "NTA. It is exactly as you say - it's your room too, you're not doing anything wrong, and her belongings are not touched. As long as you're not doing it on her bed, she needs to cope with the idea that people have sex, sometimes even in spaces she lives in (when she's not present). \n\nIf the conversation doesn't go well with the RA present, she'll probably be asking to switch roommates, so you might want to (both) start shopping and see if you can find another mismatched set of roommates to swap with.", "NTA \n\nWhen I was in college I lived in a cluster, which was essentially an apartment with 2 bathrooms, 4 bedrooms, and a little kitchen/living room area. After first semester one of the girls I lived with moved out due to a fight she had with a different roommate of ours, and she was replaced in the next semester with a girl who (in my opinion) should definitely have chosen a single room and not a communal living situation. She was very sheltered and deeply anxious, was horrified at the concept that we were drinking, because \u201cthat\u2019s illegal\u201d (in Canada the drinking age is 19, and as long as you didn\u2019t go outside with open liquor or cause a disturbance the campus police don\u2019t care.) When a roommate of ours mentioned getting stoned, this new roommate literally burst into tears and cried that we would all get arrested if anyone found out (we lived in the most marijuana friendly province in our country, even before legalization.) She also said she didn\u2019t want any men, including our boyfriends, to come into the apartment at all, including into our individual bedrooms. In my opinion, she should have chosen a single room in the substance free wing- it had enforced quiet hours, no one was allowed to partake in drugs or alcohol or be intoxicated on the whole floor at all, and she would have had her own space. I have no idea why she chose cluster (which was known for parties) instead. \n\n\nThis is a long winded way of saying that college is a time where most people learn that life is not always the way they expect. People don\u2019t always behave the same as they do. Your roommate likely never even considered fucking in the room so she didn\u2019t consider that you might. If you want complete control over what happens in your space you should choose an individual room, or it cannot be guaranteed unfortunately. You can ask a roommate to not have sex when you\u2019re not there but cannot actually enforce or control their response.", "NTA. And unless you go to a super religious college i feel like the RA will laugh at her for saying you, a freshman in college, isn\u2019t allowed to have sex in her own room", "NTA - Have sex when she's not there, make sure to remove all the evidence and don't mention it around her/to anyone who might tell her - problem solved!", "NAH \n\nYou're both just not compatible. It's not equal relationship also as she's not fucking ppl in your room. \n\nIgnorance is bliss, and you could have definitely been quiet about it, and then none of this would have happened. I wouldn't be comfortable saying to someone in ear shot, yeah i fucked in that room that weekend. Because I'm polite and don't want to make people uncomfortable thinking about me having sex in a shared space! \n\nWhen friends are over, do they know I have sex? Yes. Do I remind them of the sex I have in the home they are visiting. Or do I talk about the sex I have with other people who live in the house around? No. \n\nI think you could have spoken about your sexy times in a place you knew no one would hear, and therefore not cause any discomfort for your roommate. \n\nShe's a prude. It's obvious she's not the girl our on the weekend gobbling peen. Read the room. But you're NTA for not reading the room. Now, for the future, maybe read the room better. If you did, you wouldn't be here. And she wouldn't be thinking about all the sex that happened in your shared space.", "After reading it all and especially the end I am with NTA but she is. Sex happens especially during college times, that she comes from a place where that's taboo is all good but she is now where you guys are where it's more normalised hence the machines. She should talk with a sleep expert about her sleep screaming before even trying to go on a campus as that is weeks if not months of horrible living for a roommate who often are themselves sleep deprived due to all the homework.", "NTA clearly. She can't forbid you to have sex in your room when she is not there.", "Well, the roommate may have the right to veto anyone from visiting the shared rooms. At least that's how it worked when I was GA.", "The roommate wasn't negatively impacted by this at all.. why is this even a conversation?", "She should of went to a university that better aligned with her culture if she wanted to dictate what other people can do based on it.", "People have sex, it's a normal natural thing. The civil thing to do is to invite your fwb over when you know you have the room to yourself. Burning the scented candles is an extra cherry on top. Op did all they need to do, you're simply wrong here.", "yes, they share a room meaning they have to get used to things going on that they are not OK with all the time as long as it doesn\u2019t affect any of your stuff it\u2019s fine. op should not have to stop doing whatever she wants in the shared space just because she has an issue with sex.

I've had some wild times and I've seen some stuff but I've never seen sexual fluids just flying around the room to the point they would be landing on the roommates belonging. That is simply ridiculous. Either you've never had sex or you've only had it while totally alone in the dark if you seriously think that happens. The roommate is being rude and entitled.

You dont shoot cum across the room, its pretty localized", "Tell me you've never had sex without telling me you've never had sex...", ">She can't unilaterally ban something, but you can unilaterally overrule her and do whatever you want.\n\nThis is nonsense.  She's not being unilaterally overruled.  OP is having sex when roommate isn't even there.  And burning a candle.  It's completely unreasonable to expect more.  If you try to impose unreasonable rules, of course, of course you get overruled.  If you want a voice or rights, try using them for something other than forcing your roommate to live by your own moral code", "Sounds like OPs roommate shouldn\u2019t even have a roommate if they are going to be scream yelling and trying to dictate what their roommate is allowed to do. \n\nThey clearly do not cohabitate well with others.", "Roommate was in the room during the phone convo", ">Have you ever talked to her about what would happen if you wanted to have your FWB over when she wasn't gone for a period of time?\n\nIt's really not reasonable to expect OP to say \"hey, if you ever go home for the holidays, just wanted to give you a heads up I'll be having sex in my bed\"\n\nIf her morals dictate no sex before marriage, she should continue not having sex. It shouldn't impact OP's life.", "I think it doesn't matter what country and culture you come from.

It's not like they're fucking in the roommates bed, they're in OP's bed on OP's side of the room.", "Yes I do think there\u2019s quite a distinction between platonic friends hanging out and getting freaky in the sheets \u2014 so agreeing to have friends over doesn\u2019t automatically equate to implied consent to have sex in a shared space.", "Technically, the only reason we're eating, sleeping, and shitting is SPECIFICALLY so we can have sex to reproduce. \n\nI'm not saying anyone *needs* sex, or that it has to happen. But it's the primary goal and function of all sexually reproducing organisms. \n\nI don't think it's correct to call it a secondary function. \n\nAs far as the post goes, clearly NTA. It's just as much her space as it is her roommate's, and she's clearly not being rude about it."]}
