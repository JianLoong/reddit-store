I was assigned as a playwright with 2 other guys,K (name changed for obvious reasons) and H, both 17 as well .  And from the start I knew this was going to go down hill, I thought to myself, \u2018greeeaat, either they\u2019re gonna to include me or exclude me,\u2019. We started working, but instead of discussing about the plot and characters, they start arguing over a movie, some indie horror movie(no hate to those films), and I try to steer the conversation to the script, which they didn\u2019t give me access yet, but instead I was ignored so I did another task, and the first day was wastedl. Finally after 5 wasted days, we\u2019re trying to finish auditions when H and K start arguing over if we should keep two separate characters or not. Finally my teacher steps in and asks what\u2019s going on and they explain, he then asks for ideas for a compromise. I raise my hand and he points to me. Not even a word in and H and K start arguing AGAIN. Pissed, I got up and started heading to the door, my teacher asked what was wrong and I responded, \u201cSorry (Teacher\u2019s name), but instead of having three playwrights, it seems like there\u2019s only two in the rooms, I need some air.\u201d And I walked out the set of doors, we were in the auditorium, and my teacher walked out and I told him everything. As I was retelling this to my friend group. Most of them agreed that K and H were both in the wrong but one friend pointed out that me walking out was overreacting and I was an asshole for making a scene.

This is a great test case for working with people as an adult. Very often you will find yourself dealing with managers, co-workers, teammates, etc. that ignore everyone else because they are wrapped up in themselves or their ideas. This will, as you saw with your classmates, frustrate others and you can either choose to let the pressure build, or find ways to de-stress before you reach a boiling point. You made the smart decision by removing yourself from the situation before you let your emotions take control. I once had to hang up on my manager before I exploded as well and we both later realized we were about to explode at each other and it was the best choice. Good job and keep this experience in mind throughout your life as controlling your emotions is one of the hardest things to master.", "Yes, you're an entitled little kid.  You are a student.
