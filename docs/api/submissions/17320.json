This is a great test case for working with people as an adult. Very often you will find yourself dealing with managers, co-workers, teammates, etc. that ignore everyone else because they are wrapped up in themselves or their ideas. This will, as you saw with your classmates, frustrate others and you can either choose to let the pressure build, or find ways to de-stress before you reach a boiling point. You made the smart decision by removing yourself from the situation before you let your emotions take control.
