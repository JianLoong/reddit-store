We're in the basement level so there is only someone over top of us and recently they moved out and someone else moved in. \n\nOn the first night of him moving in my partner and I wake up at 2:30 in the morning to our ceiling right above our bed creaking very loudly. We are both heavy sleepers and just tried to ignore it and go back to bed. This went on until 4am and we both started getting really irritated. My partner grabbed the broom and hit the ceiling a few times which I believe made him realize what we could hear way too much. He stopped right after for the night.\n\nI felt bad because I didn't want to embarrass him or make his privacy feel invaded because I believe you should be able to do as you wish in your home, but my partner works a lot and need to get their sleep at night. I figured that he would do something about his bed considering he was now aware of how audible it was. \n\nWe've heard him a few times since then, but usually during the day where I could put music on or just leave the apartment. The strange part is that is usually the only thing we can hear from his apartment. There is never a tv or music going, no one ever is talking or ever a second pair of footsteps, all we hear is the frequent rocking of the bed. I wouldn't judge for it besides the timing and placement of the bed. It wasn't until last night we had problem. \n\nI had some friends over last night before went out to celebrate Halloween. It was around 10:30 or 11pm when we started hearing the bed shake yet again even over the music and talking of five or six people. It was embarrassing and awkward to listen to, so my partner gave three taps on the ceiling to try to get the guy to chill or be quieter. The next thing you know he starts stomping like crazy in his apartment obviously upset. All my friends were put on edge because of this guy and made the apartment feel stressful, we then explained the situation and all laughed and joked about it because there was nothing else we could do. We all got back to our apartment around 2:30am so we could have a minute while we waited for our friends to leave. \n\nThis man started stomping again as soon as we got back, like he was waiting and listening. It felt really immature and childish and my partner wanted to go talk to him, granted they were tipsy and it was almost 3 in the morning, and I convinced them to not just to avoid problematic confrontations at least for the night.\n\nAITA for starting this feud with the new neighbor?", "created_utc": 1667161104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhoqjo/aita_for_starting_a_feud_with_the_new_neighbor/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
