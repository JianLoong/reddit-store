We met while students in the Netherlands. Weirdly no one has ever been unkind about us being an interracial couple (at least not to my face), so I wonder if I am overreaching into this situation, because I have never faced this.\n\nMy older cousin \"Jim\"'s son \"Alex\" is graduated from high school in may. I grew up next door to Jim and his siblings and we are all very close. Jim initially told me that Alex did not want to have a big graduation party, but if I wanted to stop by quickly on the Saturday after the graduation, I was welcome to do so. He asked three or four times if Tom would be coming and was very insistent that it was not necessary. Tom has a big project pending at work so I figured he didn't need to come with for me to drop off a check and a card, so the whole thing did seem weird. \n\nWell, I arrive at Jim's house to find a full on party underway. I was incredibly shocked and when I asked my aunt (Jim's mom) what was going on she said that the party had been planned for months and that's why we were all invited over. I told her what Jim had told me and she looked a bit sheepish and said, \"Oh, that' probably because \"Sarah's\" family is here.\" Sarah is Jim's wife. I don't know her family well and haven't really seen them since Jim and Sarah's wedding when I was a teenager. Anyway, regardless of any explanation I left, without saying goodbye or leaving the card and check on the gift table (this will be important later).\n\nJim called me the next day asking where I had gone. I told him I was shocked that there was a party when I was explicitly told there would be no party and thus not to bring my husband. Jim started to cry (which is weird and out of character) and told me that Sarah's family is \"very old fashion\" and would disapprove of an interracial couple. They didn't want to cause a scene on Alex's big day, but they wanted me there so they came up with a \"half-truth\" to keep Tom from coming. I was, to say the least speechless. I just hung up the phone.\n\nLater my mom called to say, she hadn't known about the whole plan to keep Tom away, but she had spoken to her sister (my aunt) who was very hurt that I hadn't left Alex his gift. My mom said AITA for punishing Alex for what his parents did and I should give him the check I was planning on giving him. Frankly, I don't want anything to do with any of them right now, but I worry I am being unfair to Alex.

You keep your check and your distance from him. This is a consequence of bad behavior.", "They were being assholes when they didn't inform this to you beforehand and made up a lie. Had u been informed then u could have decided to just not attend the party and give Alex his gift afterwards if you wanted.\n\nYour husband is as much a part of the family as his inlaws.

First, they are teaching their son that this is okay - it is absolutely not.

A gift, while nice, isn't required. But civility, hospitality and acceptance is, no matter what. Jim had every opportunity to insist that in their home, they welcome everyone but he didn't. You may send a congratulatory card or a handwritten note but the gift? No. Then move on.", "NTA-Alex is innocent but that doesn\u2019t mean you did anything wrong by not leaving a gift after you learned his parents are catering to racists.", "NTA.

It sounds like you're only giving Alex a gift out of obligation and have no interest in his life, which is fine. If you are withholding a gift you would otherwise give because his parents are assholes though, that is kind of an asshole move. But considering what happened I can't blame you for doing anything rash. Just figure out whether you want to give the gift or not and do it, the kid shouldn't be caught in the middle.", "NTA sad to say but Alex\u2019s parents actions caused him not getting a gift. So that\u2019s not your problems that\u2019s Jim\u2019s and his wife\u2019s problem.", "Why are you punishing a child for his parents bad choice? You are not the asshole for leaving. You are the asshole for punishing an innocent kid. You should have gone up to the kid and congratulated him and handed him the card and then left and dealt with his parents later.", "\u201cOld fashioned\u201d \n\nNTA and I would consider the rest of your family as quietly racist as well if they are backing any of this nonsense with your cousin up.", "NTA\n\nSo they didn't want the two of you there but wanted the money. Jim and Alex, but especially Jim, were too gutless to stand up for you and your husband.\n\nI would go NC with the lot of them. They sound like racists AHs. Keep your money.", "NTA. You can give him the check if you want, but I would add a note explaining why you left the party and would be going LC with them.", "NTA \\*cough\\* public shaming", "NTA - I feel bad for you cousin, yes, but I feel worse for you and your husband.\n\nYou aren't punishing Alex you are simply not giving a gift to someone where your family was not welcome. You have no obligation to give gifts to people who disrespect you and your husband like that. \n\nHere's the reality: people lied and chose to accommodate the feelings of others who didn't deserve it. They choose to make people with awful prejudices be babied. \"Oh we can't offend the racists. What would they say?\" \n\nWell it turns out that by choosing to not offend the racists they opted to offend others and then are surprised that there were consequences for that. If guess they were so used to everyone around them being \"understanding\" of the racists that they weren't expecting there would be people who wouldn't. \n\nThat's what happens when different groups of people tip-toe around people - they start assume that everyone will follow suit. You didn't and now they are sad. Well boo hoo to them. \n\nNTA NTA NTA", "NTA this wasn\u2019t a half truth. I agree with the thought of if you\u2019re punishing Alex but also\u2026. Whose parents let you be humiliated and lied to you? Made you feel as if interracial couples don\u2019t have as much value? Absolutely bonkers", "NTA. \"Old fashioned\" is liking old music, reading newspapers instead of watching the news app and having a flip phone. This is just racism.", "This. Shame on the cousin for harbouring racists, and shame on the aunt for only caring about the cheque. Screw these people.", "My mom seems to think that because Alex's maternal grandparents were the source of the objection the rest of us should \"suck it up\" because \"it's their grandson and they are entitled to their opinions.\"", "Taking what side, exactly?? Is there now a side to racism that has a correct side? Seriously, please read what you wrote.", "I'm not sure Alex asked. OPs aunt is the one who is 'hurt' by OP not giving the child of the racist asshole money.", "Good point.  I'm a stickler for thank you notes, so my kids are weirdly okay with not always getting gifts, as they get to avoid the (apparent) agony of writing the TYs!  At a really big party, they would probably not even notice who gave a gift and who didn't.", "Also, the cheque would be from an interracial couple. If they have a problem with the couple, they should have a problem with the cheque\u2026.poisonous fruit and all. \n\nBut I assume their greedy asses were just seeing dollar signs, not color at that point. \n\nNTA", ">I'm going to be the lone wolf here and agree that you did the right thing.\n\nThat's very brave of you, and the dozens of other lone wolves who posted the exact same popular opinion.", "This. Good idea. Explain to Alex that you didn\u2019t keep the gift to hurt him, but rather you were hurt by the situation and needed to excuse yourself. Explain that having your own family cater towards racists and lie to you about it (\u201chalf truths\u201d aren\u2019t a thing - that\u2019s still a lie) was shocking and you couldn\u2019t stand by and watch that.", "Oh, I am sure other people knew! I just didn't. I have met these people max four times my whole life--with the vast majority of those times happening over. 2 week period 21 years ago when Sarah and Jim got married.", "Its not punishing anybody. There is no obligation to give gifts. Doubly no obligation when the people hosting the party deliberately lie to ensure one half of the gift giving party won't be there. I would say that erases any prior obligation that would have existed.", "So just accepting/tolerating racism is perfectly acceptable to your family members? No one can see how wrong that is?  What if they didn\u2019t accept Democrats?  Or Trump supporters?  Or Christians?  Or people who didn\u2019t go to college?  (you get the point). Would all of those prejudices be acceptable?", "\"My mom seems to think that because Alex's maternal grandparents were the source of the objection the rest of us should \"suck it up\" because \"it's their grandson and they are entitled to their opinions.\"\"\n\nThey're entitled to their opinions.  They're absolutely,  completely wrong and f'ed up, but they're entitled to them.\n\nYou, however,  are NTA.", "Why are people entitled to opinions on your marriage and your husband's race?", "And that's why, sorry to say, your mom isn't the best of people either. Apparently they are not just entitled to their opinions but also entitled to have everyone else accommodate their prejudices.\n\nTell you Mom that if they are entitled to not see an interracial couple because they don't like that then you are entitled to be upset and not give the gift you were planning on giving. After all - everyone should be accommodated and no one should be challenged about anything ever.", "People who condone racism are racists. Period. I'm sorry that you had to deal with this and hope you cut them all off.", "\nSome people are SIMPLY racist.You absolutely can't change their view like in this case his in laws. He probably knew a conflict was bound to happen if both were present.\n\nYes  He could have taken a stand against it but he values his in laws more than his cousin . That's the fact hence was willing to exclude him. By side I meant prefer his inlaws to his cousin and her husband.\n\nEdit.Don't preach me.I am asian myself and on top of that a med student. There are always some patients or some doctors who aren't a fan of people like us. Do I go around and teach them ' How not to be racist'? \nBut if they disrespect me directly I do speak against it and also expect the same from my close friends. \nBut other than that I don't think I have the responsibility to change the mindset of each and every people that dislike me.", "Good point. I read too fast.", "Yeah I don\u2019t see anything here that says Alex asked or was aware of any of this.  Unless there\u2019s some indication that Alex has racist views as well and/or was in agreement with not asking OPs husband, I guess I\u2019m not sure he should be punished here.  Clearly everyone else is an idiot.  OP is NTA regardless.", "You are not being overly sensitive. You are NTA. I\u2019m in the exact same setup as you are and this is my nightmare. They deliberately misled you to exclude him. This is racism in practice. And to be frank this is a honest view into their values.", "But you can't decide sides on issues like racism by who you like more. If you allow someone to be excluded because of their race, you've allowed them to be excludes because of their race. OPs cousin can't hide behind family ties."]}
