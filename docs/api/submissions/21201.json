We met while students in the Netherlands. Weirdly no one has ever been unkind about us being an interracial couple (at least not to my face), so I wonder if I am overreaching into this situation, because I have never faced this.\n\nMy older cousin \"Jim\"'s son \"Alex\" is graduated from high school in may. I grew up next door to Jim and his siblings and we are all very close. Jim initially told me that Alex did not want to have a big graduation party, but if I wanted to stop by quickly on the Saturday after the graduation, I was welcome to do so. He asked three or four times if Tom would be coming and was very insistent that it was not necessary. Tom has a big project pending at work so I figured he didn't need to come with for me to drop off a check and a card, so the whole thing did seem weird. \n\nWell, I arrive at Jim's house to find a full on party underway. I was incredibly shocked and when I asked my aunt (Jim's mom) what was going on she said that the party had been planned for months and that's why we were all invited over. I told her what Jim had told me and she looked a bit sheepish and said, \"Oh, that' probably because \"Sarah's\" family is here.\" Sarah is Jim's wife. I don't know her family well and haven't really seen them since Jim and Sarah's wedding when I was a teenager. Anyway, regardless of any explanation I left, without saying goodbye or leaving the card and check on the gift table (this will be important later).\n\nJim called me the next day asking where I had gone. I told him I was shocked that there was a party when I was explicitly told there would be no party and thus not to bring my husband. Jim started to cry (which is weird and out of character) and told me that Sarah's family is \"very old fashion\" and would disapprove of an interracial couple. They didn't want to cause a scene on Alex's big day, but they wanted me there so they came up with a \"half-truth\" to keep Tom from coming. I was, to say the least speechless. I just hung up the phone.\n\nLater my mom called to say, she hadn't known about the whole plan to keep Tom away, but she had spoken to her sister (my aunt) who was very hurt that I hadn't left Alex his gift. My mom said AITA for punishing Alex for what his parents did and I should give him the check I was planning on giving him. Frankly, I don't want anything to do with any of them right now, but I worry I am being unfair to Alex.

It would have been bad enough if they'd called you up and said \"look, there are going to be some racists at the party, and we're kind of on their side, so your husband cannot come, but you're very welcome - please bring a check!\"  But to go through this elaborate charade to get you to the party and let you be humiliated by the discovery that you'd been tricked? Literally unforgivable.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not American so maybe that\u2019s why I find the concept of giving a kid a cheque for simply finishing high school baffling. \n\nThe idea that him getting that cheque is somehow more grievous than the racism and lies is even more ridiculous.", "NTA. To be clear, making exceptions so racists feel comfortable just makes you a racist. Whoever hosted the party didn't invite someone because of their race. So racist. \n\nAnd to be even clearer, her parents arent \"old fashioned\" theyre just racist. They aren't from the 1800s are they? They were born in the 50s at the earliest. \n\nIf anything you are underreacting. This is no different than them calling your husband the n word.

That gift is from you AND your husband. If they exclude him from the party,  they forfeit any rights to your shared gift.", "Take Alex out for lunch and tell him what happened. See his reaction.

Send a card to Alex and inform him you've made a donation in his name to a group that fights racism.  \n\nAnd why is an 18 year old man's mother keeping track of his graduation presents?\n\nYour cousin and his mother went to an elaborate plot to keep your husband from the party and were more concerned about the gifts. \n\nYour mother is more concerned about keeping the peace by you giving Alex a gift instead of your and your husband's exclusion because of Jim's bigoted inlaws. \n\nThey're old fashioned? The Civil rights movement gained momentum in the 50s and 60s. Everyone under the age of 90 has grown up where civil rights have been an issue. It's stupid and ignorant to call them old fashioned.  Old fashioned is someone still on a dial up modem. Being racist is not old fashioned its willful prejudice.", "Nta, but Alex didn\u2019t disappoint you. Jim on the other hand can go suck it.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't punish Alex at all.  The HOSTS made you feel uncomfortable, so you left the party.

You just refused to be victimized by fucking racist trash.", "NTA\n\nEveryone is more worried about a check than that Jim and Sarah are lying to and excluding family to appease a bunch of racists?

Alex shouldn\u2019t suffer because of her family. \n\nMy advice from here; invite Alex out for brunch/dinner with you and Tom, apologise for not giving them their gift on the day of the party, and give it to them there. Have a nice time, chat about the future, and Alex will feel more special for being taken out personally to celebrate. Then, next time Jim invites you anywhere, you can decide how petty you\u2019re feeling in the moment and either accept on the condition Tom goes too without issues, or make a show and dance of \u201coh, as long as my interracial boyfriend is allowed to come, I sure hope I don\u2019t upset your racist inlaws\u201d and go from there \ud83d\ude01", "Nta.

Nothing you wrote shows that Alex is hateful or racist. I would give him the check directly, maybe you and your husband can take him to lunch. If he asks why you left, it would be a perfect time to tell him the truth. Even if he doesn\u2019t ask it may be good to explain to him.", "NTA. What they did was cruel. I\u2019m in a interracial marriage, I\u2019m black and my husband is white. My husband previous marriage essentially broke up\ndue to certain family members racism. I\u2019m lucky my husband has grown up a lot since his first marriage. Because when certain members of his family show up to events, we are out.Their mixture of racism and my petty behavior is just not good mixture. I live in what is call the Bible Belt , in USA. These states are god, country, and family. What I appreciate about my husband family is that they are blatant about their racism. \n\nMy husband and I have found ways around his family. We will mail out cards and presents to children under 18, so that we don\u2019t single out kids. I say this if you and husband decide to send the gift mail it. You know your family best is your cousin and wife somebody you want to continue in your life. If not cut them out, which means their children will be cut off. My husband recently came to conclusion that he needed to stop sending gifts and just cut folks out of his life. Which has caused  a lot of issues. In my husband defense, I have high tolerance for racism. Meaning, I see it as part of American culture and it\u2019s not my job to call people out. I\u2019m also firm believer that it not my job to Police his relationship with his family. His family isn\u2019t part of our daily lives, so they don\u2019t effect me.  You need to figure out what you will tolerate. If have children are these the kind of people you want to be around your children.

Maybe invite him to your house for lunch or something and give him the card.", "NTA. We should shun bigots from all things until they die.", "Yeah, unfortunately this is racism. Not the \"in-your-face\" racism that's more obvious and easy to point out, but the brand of racism that \"totally not racist\" people do. They wanted to keep face with a racist family member(s), but they don't want to bring their friend who would be the target of the racism around them, so they make some excuse as to why they shouldn't be there but the racist family member should be.\n\nThat's still racism. And this strategy is also used to cover up other bigotry too. But covering it up allows bigotry to fester like an infected wound. Expose it to the air and light.\n\nThe correct course is to either not invite the racist person, or to kick them out if they say or do anything racist. What they are doing is trying not to rock the boat with the racist family members. Appealing to racists at the expense of the people they target is also racism, just not said our loud. \n\nNTA", "NTA... You should let Alex know the reason you left.", "I have zero sympathy for people who defend the racism of racist family members.

So sad this is still even a thing in 2023.", "NTA for not just sticking up for your husband, but just being a reasonably decent person in the first place. Jim Crow cried because he had to come out as racist. The rest of the family got angry because they were caught red handed being racist by you by means of excluding members of their own family for the comfort of their racist in-laws. Also you made the right call not leaving the check, lying racists are not the kind of people you want to leave something as small and valuable as a check laying around, plus there\u2019s no guarantee that Alex would even see the money if he were to get the envelope in hand.", "NTA, I don't blame you at all for leaving the party.  Make the racists uncomfortable.  That being said, Alex is not at all to blame for this.  Maybe arrange a lunch for just the two of you.

NTA", "So let's get this right. \n\nInstead of telling Sarah's family that they needed to keep their bigotry in check or they would be asked to leave, they decided not to invite a black man to the party. \n\nThey then didn't even have the character to own their discriminatory behaviour and lied when any fool could put two and two together. \n\nWhilst ever people like Sarah's family is accommodated instead of challenged, racism will persist.\n\nAnd then to top it off, instead of reflecting on their behaviour and calling with a sincere apology they want to know where the cheque is.

And that he can ask his parents why. Because you were never invited; you were told to drop by *quickly* and leave your check by the back door, like the embarrassment to the family they appears to view you as.
