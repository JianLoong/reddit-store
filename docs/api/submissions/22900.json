You mentioned how her crossing your boundaries was a recurring theme in your relationship. You were completely right to be upset and your intense reaction is (while not ideal) understandable given the circumstances.\n\nHowever, I do think you should seek her our and apologize.

Overall, addiction or not, sister is TA. I do think you should reach out and try to apologize for whatever you feel is necessary, but keep in mind your sister might not be receptive.

This is not being nice.  This is doing what they want.  This is not nice at all and actually very toxic.  And this is ignoring the whole substance abuse angle which makes your WHOLE family look much worse.  This isn't a supportive family, this is a family that thinks they \"Know better.\"\n\nIf your family doesn't recognize this and is mad at you for getting sick due to the plans your sister enacted against your protest it seems to me that your sister and family have done nothing but contribute to your substance abuse.  I'm not putting it all on them.  But what I'm saying is they are NOT HELPING.  This is not how I would treat a sibling who needed help and from what I can see, would like some help.\n\nI'm surprised your doing as well as you are.

I\u2019m trying to put myself in her shoes to understand why she would do something like that to/for you: at best, she thought she knew better than you what would make you feel celebrated and appreciated on your birthday, which is still an arrogant, arsehole move. At this point I think you have to be careful who you let back into your life, so if you think she will be a positive influence and maybe a source of support then I think opening up a dialogue could be worth a try. I don\u2019t think that means you have to come straight out the gate with an apology: it\u2019s reasonable to instead ask if you can meet up and talk with her about what happened and see if you can both come to an understanding. I\u2019m willing to bet that if she hasn\u2019t spoken to you in 2 years then she\u2019s probably been telling herself some kind of narrative along the lines of \u201cI tried to do something nice for her and she threw it back in my face\u201d, because a lot of us tend to do that when it comes to unresolved arguments, so it would be best to try and get to a place where you\u2019re both sitting down calmly and you can explain exactly how it all made you feel. Then, ideally, she can tell you what her motivations were, and hopefully they\u2019re relatively benign. From there it shouldn\u2019t feel like sacrificing the moral high ground to apologise for what was said and done on both sides.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think she has the maturity to try and resolve this calmly with you, then I suggest waiting. I\u2019ve known people who suffer with addiction and family troubles can make the whole process harder. Anyway, congratulations on your sobriety and graduation, that\u2019s amazing and I\u2019m so happy for you!", "NTA You set a clear and firm boundary and your sister crossed it. FAFO did was yell at her, you coulda puked all over her! CONGRATULATIONS on one year sober - keep up the good work!", "NTA but an olive branch may not hurt. I assume your parents have a pretty decent grasp on what happened based on your being a minor at the time so it may not hurt to see if they can be the messenger or mediate a bit in this assuming you have a good relationship with them. \n\nYour sister didn\u2019t respect your boundaries but I normally have to default to \u201cdon\u2019t blame on malice that which can be blamed by incompetence/ignorance\u201d. Even if your reaction was justified you could still apologize for the way you reacted and the specific words you said. Even with a big age gap I would assume your sister was also relatively young in this situation and also prone to rash decisions\u2026 then again getting mad at someone for throwing up is excessively stupid. \n\nRegardless trying to have a calm, respectful conversation with a pre stated goal of mending your relationship wouldn\u2019t hurt. Apologize for the words you said but express that she crossed boundaries you have and why you have them (not a doctor, but that sounds very PTSD like with your response to balloons).
