This is not being nice.  This is doing what they want.  This is not nice at all and actually very toxic.

I\u2019m trying to put myself in her shoes to understand why she would do something like that to/for you: at best, she thought she knew better than you what would make you feel celebrated and appreciated on your birthday, which is still an arrogant, arsehole move. At this point I think you have to be careful who you let back into your life, so if you think she will be a positive influence and maybe a source of support then I think opening up a dialogue could be worth a try. I don\u2019t think that means you have to come straight out the gate with an apology: it\u2019s reasonable to instead ask if you can meet up and talk with her about what happened and see if you can both come to an understanding. I\u2019m willing to bet that if she hasn\u2019t spoken to you in 2 years then she\u2019s probably been telling herself some kind of narrative along the lines of \u201cI tried to do something nice for her and she threw it back in my face\u201d, because a lot of us tend to do that when it comes to unresolved arguments, so it would be best to try and get to a place where you\u2019re both sitting down calmly and you can explain exactly how it all made you feel. Then, ideally, she can tell you what her motivations were, and hopefully they\u2019re relatively benign. From there it shouldn\u2019t feel like sacrificing the moral high ground to apologise for what was said and done on both sides.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think she has the maturity to try and resolve this calmly with you, then I suggest waiting. I\u2019ve known people who suffer with addiction and family troubles can make the whole process harder. Anyway, congratulations on your sobriety and graduation, that\u2019s amazing and I\u2019m so happy for you!", "NTA You set a clear and firm boundary and your sister crossed it.

Even with a big age gap I would assume your sister was also relatively young in this situation and also prone to rash decisions\u2026 then again getting mad at someone for throwing up is excessively stupid. \n\nRegardless trying to have a calm, respectful conversation with a pre stated goal of mending your relationship wouldn\u2019t hurt. Apologize for the words you said but express that she crossed boundaries you have and why you have them (not a doctor, but that sounds very PTSD like with your response to balloons).

I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re in the wrong, but it won\u2019t hurt to mend the bridge.", "NTA, you made your feelings about it clear, and she disrespected your wishes. \n\nOf course if either of you want to fix things you can reach out but she had a go because you were sick on the carpet. Would she yell at a child for doing it? It's not like you wanted to do it. She's definitely the AH here and your reaction is justified.", "NTA. Are you sure you want contact with someone who does this kind of thing?", "NTA this sounds... really deliberate on her part. This is just a slice of your life together but if its one that's indicative of your broader relationship, you deserve an apology, not her.\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety. The initial momentum is the hardest to start; you're on the right track! <3", "You're young... just have that hard conversation.\n\nAddiction is tough but you were a kid. Dont hold onto it forever and don't let them hold that version of you. \n\nDo what you can control, which is initiate the conversation. Type it all out in a text and say \"call me\" at the end if you have to. \n\nIt usually turns out better than we expect :)", "You will always be an addict. Maybe going forward you can always be clean and sober.\n\nI wish you a good life. Be strong. \u270c\ufe0f", "So you hate parties because of the balloons? Maybe I'm dumb but at this party did she still have balloons? Also would you be OK w parties if there were no balloons at all?", "YTA\n\nBefore the surprise ever happened and it was just a family dinner, you were subjecting your family, especially small kids to you being high on a cocktail of drugs for your sweet 16", "Isn\u2019t that the truth about surprises. I remember I was going to surprise my mom with a visit and my Dad knew. He told me that if I knew I would be able to come, I should tell her in advance so she could enjoy the anticipation of the visit. Contrived surprises are often for the video, for the reaction, and in this case, if she had thrown him a non-surprise birthday party he wouldn\u2019t have come. That\u2019s just not cool.", "I don't think she should seek anybody out and apologize. This person is maintaining their sobriety and moving forward in life.  Sounds like the overstepping sister was a considerable stressor. Distance for much longer might be the path to healthy living. Seems to be working so far", "As someone who was treated like absolute shit on my birthdays as a kid I fully agree. I don't think I've actually celebrated one since being a preteen and I'm in my 40s and have had to make it clear that I don't want a celebration. I've gotten into screaming matches with my family over it and it got to the point I'd end up disappearing on my birthdays until I was old enough to move away then just started blocking phone numbers so they couldn't contact me.", "Yeah, I\u2019m 18 right now and it was my 16th birthday party when she threw me the party.", "To be clear, the OP also said she doesn't like loud noises and surprises.", "There were a lot balloons at the party. And no, I don\u2019t really like social gatherings in general that are \u201ccentered around me\u201d I guess. I\u2019m okay with going to other peoples birthday parties.", "I was influenced by my friends who where much much older than me to start doing drugs.", "I second this. Unnecessary stress could cause relapses and I would not wish that on anyone, much less OP.", "She didn't actually say she didn't like surprises at any point tbf", "Bummer", "The most important thing is you are sober now, and you are doing an amazing job at turning your life around. You should be really freaking proud of yourself, and I wish you all the success in the world! You absolutely deserve it, regardless of what anyone who says different thinks. You have been an addict to then have gotten yourself sober to turn your life around to the point where you are getting ready to go to college, all before turning 18! So you have absolutely reason to celebrate yourself. \n\nAnd while everyone is responsible for their own actions, there is a huge chunk of this that is definitely on your parents and other adults in your life that didn't do the right things to prevent this from happening in the first place. Or notice sooner so you could have gotten help earlier, and it didn't have to get as bad as it did when you were at your worst. \n\nGive yourself some grace with this situation... You can reach out but do absolutely understand that what happened wasn't your fault because you asked her nicely plenty of times to not throw you a party for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with you being on drugs at the time. How you reacted could have been better, but you couldn't exactly control it at the time, and you obviously know it and feel extremely remorseful about it. If you really care about this relationship more than admitting who was right and wrong in this, you could say something like \"while I asked you so many time to not throw me a party because of so many reasons that have absolutely nothing with my addiction, I am extremely sorry for how I reacted because of my addiction\". That way it should be cut and dry, and doesn't open up room for a huge arguement like saying something like, \"I know I reacted badly, but I asked you so many times to not throw me a party\" which is just automatically going to put her on the defense and probably cause an arguement and not resolve anything. And if she doesn't respond positively to you than that is 100% on her, and you should not feel guilty for not having a relationship with her.", "By themselves how? And more now than before how exactly?", "There are so many things wrong with this statement it really is laughable. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA \n\nAny olive branch you proffer, do it via a note. Then she can process it however she chooses and however long that takes her. Keep it short and simple. \n\n\"I am sorry that I told you I never wanted to see you again. I appreciate you taking me at my word. I imagine that was difficult for you. I hope you and your family are well.\"\n\nAnd that's it. Nothing else. If she has a response, she may filter it via mom.", "NTA, but if you want any type of relationship with your sister you need to initiate it. You said you never want to see her again and she complied. If you want to see her you make the phone call and see if you can meet, cause your sister is just honoring your request \n\n\nI also think you should remember that you are her baby sister and she had to experience you struggling with addiction, she probably wanted you to have a normal 16th birthday.", "NTA, being on drugs is irrelevant, she crossed a clear boundary you set over and over.", "NTA. You asked for no party for valid reasons that didn't have anything to with your addiction. Well your sister FAFO. That is on her. \n\nHonestly I think the vomit was a nice touch to drive the point home. \n\nI do commend you on your sobriety. That it is a lot of willpower and you are choosing it all day, every day.", "[removed]", "I would refuse to be the apologizer out of principle. It would mean admitting I was in the wrong when im not. I would be down for a mutual apology in this case though.", "Which is great, except she knew the balloon phobia...and knew op didn't want this.   So, normal party?  No, she did this for herself, and her motives are questionable", "I am her baby brother. I guess that makes sense that she would want some normalcy.", "<citation needed>", "NTA - your sister is an abusive AH narcissist. Take care OP, and congratulations on your sobriety.", "NTA how hard would it be to respect your wishes on your birthday of all days.", "Everything aside - you cannot expect her to reach out after saying you never wanted to see her again. The steps urge you to make amends, if you want to do it. If not dont, but hopefully you will see this clearer", "You are your new sober self, and as such you can approach your sister to apologise. Maybe begin in writing? No excuses, just I\u2019m sober. I\u2019m sorry I said I never wanted to see you again. and I love you. I don\u2019t know. I hope things work out.", "agreed 100%", "NTA, but if you want a relationship with your sister, you need to instigate it and be okay with the response. She has the right to say no.", "NTA but if you miss her and want to reconnect, why not reach out to her? I don't know either of you but sometimes people do things thinking this is how I would like it to be FOR ME, instead of thinking what the other person wants. Maybe she didn't throw that party with the intention of making you feel bad, the same way you didn't like it with the intention of making her feel bad. Arguments happen but people can move on and rekindle a relationship.", "Definitely NTA! And congratulations on your one year anniversary of sobriety. Your sister ignored your wishes and should\u2019ve listened to you. Good luck with college.", "Yup, when you say over and over that you don't want birthday parties, she won't listen, but when you tell her once you don't want to see her again, suddenly she listens to you. Your NTA, focus on yourself and surround yourself with people who respect you(r boundaries) and love you for who you are", "I think surprises are good if you know the person likes surprises. My mother loves them. My sister and I surprised her for her 50th. She lived in another country (over 8 hours on plane). She had zero clue that we were coming and loves the video of her reaction. The video is basically her way of remembering. However, we would never do that if we know that they don\u2019t like surprises.", "NTA you told her you hated it and she still threw it for you anyways, she over stepped and fucked up", "NTA at all. I agree with all the comments about your sister throwing that party for her and that she was actually *not* being nice. Nice people don\u2019t stomp boundaries and then get mad when the person who placed them is upset.\n\nIf you decide to contact her, I would mail a letter - without a return address. You are doing SO well and I think you should live your life, rock college and continue to grow stronger before subjecting yourself to her again.\n\nWay to GO on ALL your hard work this past year!!!! I hope you can surround yourself with people who build you up and support you and let you know how proud they are of you!!! This internet stranger certainly is!", "NTA, she is. But if you miss her and want her in your life, you could talk to her. You wont be the asshole for not talking to her first, but you want to contact her, you might have to do it. The one at fault doesn't necessarily have to be the one to take the first step. It all depends how important your relationship is to you."]}
