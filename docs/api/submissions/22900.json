These wishes should be respected and it\u2019s entirely unreasonable for your sister to ignore your requests on this matter. Surprise anythings are always for the emotional gratification of the person doing the surprising, though they are loath to admit that. \n\nWho cleaned up the vomit?", "ESH but mostly you", "YTA while I totally get that she crossed a line with the party you haven\u2019t spoken to her in two years. Do you really that some who was told \u201cI never want to see you again.\u201d Will reach reach out first?\nIsn\u2019t part of most recovery programs about making amends and apologizing for crap you did when you were under the influence?", "NTA", "First, congratulations on your one year!! \nSecond, absolutely NTA! \nYou didn\u2019t want a party (therefore you set up a boundary) and she disrespected that boundary.", "NTA.  None of this was for you.  It might have been done to you, but everything here is her doing what she wants for herself.  She's not 'just being nice' by any means.  As for your question, my answer is neither.  Just go to college and live your life.", "NTA. Congratulations on your one year of sobriety, I know from experience how hard it is. Ignore all the comments calling you TA or saying ESH just because you are a recovering addict. You\u2019re doing amazing. As for your sister, go with what your gut says, you know what\u2019s best for you. Like what other people have said, do prepare for a negative experience if you decide to reach out. It seems like crossing your boundaries was a regular occurrence for her and that may not have changed. Maybe suggest meeting to talk out what happened and take it from there? Though whatever you decide to do, I wish you all the best with your sobriety and in life.", "NTA. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a one time thing if you\u2019ve had to beg her not to throw you parties for you birthday. Your reaction was a bit over the top but drugs or no drugs you hate these things so I can assume your reaction would have been similar just without throwing up. \n\nIf you miss her - reach out. But be prepared for a negative experience because your sister sounds like an asshole.", "NTA. While I think you saying what you said was wrong, I don't think you qualify as an asshole for it. You were a kid struggling with a serious and dangerous condition. You were going through an insanely difficult time in your life and you reacted intensely to something upsetting happening to you. Obviously you shouldn't have said what you said, but given the factors I do not think you're an asshole for it.\n\nYour sister betrayed your trust and did something that you explicitly asked her several times not to do, something that she knew was scary and upsetting for you, but she did it anyway because SHE wanted it, and ended up humiliating you in front of other people and ruining your birthday. You mentioned how her crossing your boundaries was a recurring theme in your relationship. You were completely right to be upset and your intense reaction is (while not ideal) understandable given the circumstances.\n\nHowever, I do think you should seek her our and apologize. You deserve an apology too but I think it'd be better to make amends and try to repair your relationship with her.", "[deleted]", "NTA In fact, being estranged from your sister may be the right call. In fact, it\u2019s telling that you\u2019ve done better with sobriety since you\u2019ve been out of contact with your sister.\n\nIt is nothing short of sadistic to force a surprise party on someone who hates them. It\u2019s even more sadistic to surprise someone who is phobic of loud noises with twenty people screaming at once.\n\nIt\u2019s also awful that your sister blamed you for throwing up.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur sister is an abusive AH.", "What behavior? \nBeing surprised and throwing up in a matter she had no control over, organized by the person who knew the trauma response?", "Calling an addict an asshole for developing an addiction is horrifying in my opinion.You don't know how they developed an addiction. You know nothing about what happened to them. There isn't nearly enough context for us to be able to decide whether they're an asshole for how their addiction played out. Immediately jumping to call addicts assholes for developing a disease is harmful and contributes a lot to stigma around addiction, which makes recovery harder. Please in the future reconsider before saying something like this", "In addition to the other reply, I don\u2019t see how OP\u2019s behaviour could be interpreted as poor in the first place. They set a boundary and their sister knowingly violated it. Their addiction is irrelevant", "I agree with the other comments made to you. You can't just call someone, a teenager, an arsehole for getting addicted. Wtf.\nYou are an arsehole for doing arsehole things, like criticizing a person for their hardships without the full context, but making your own assumptions on what that context is.", "I clean led up the vomit.", "This is a very important perspective. A lot of people are crapping all over you OP for being an addict, but a minor doesn't get here by themselves.\n\nTake care of yourself, sounds like no one else is.", "I don\u2019t know man, I guess I was just hoping it wasn\u2019t as bad as it sounds.", "Do you really need to be so unnecessarily cruel to a teenager who struggled with a serious disease?", "OP is NTA - simply because the sister knew what she was doing, and that OP didn't want a birthday party.", "Good on you \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc. Do you want contact with your sister? Do you think it would be good for you at this point in time? She may not have changed.
