These wishes should be respected and it\u2019s entirely unreasonable for your sister to ignore your requests on this matter. Surprise anythings are always for the emotional gratification of the person doing the surprising, though they are loath to admit that. \n\nWho cleaned up the vomit?", "[deleted]", "YTA while I totally get that she crossed a line with the party you haven\u2019t spoken to her in two years. Do you really that some who was told \u201cI never want to see you again.\u201d Will reach reach out first?\nIsn\u2019t part of most recovery programs about making amends and apologizing for crap you did when you were under the influence?", "NTA", "First, congratulations on your one year!! \nSecond, absolutely NTA! \nYou didn\u2019t want a party (therefore you set up a boundary) and she disrespected that boundary.", "NTA.  None of this was for you.  It might have been done to you, but everything here is her doing what she wants for herself.  She's not 'just being nice' by any means.  As for your question, my answer is neither.  Just go to college and live your life.", "NTA. Congratulations on your one year of sobriety, I know from experience how hard it is. Ignore all the comments calling you TA or saying ESH just because you are a recovering addict. You\u2019re doing amazing. As for your sister, go with what your gut says, you know what\u2019s best for you. Like what other people have said, do prepare for a negative experience if you decide to reach out. It seems like crossing your boundaries was a regular occurrence for her and that may not have changed. Maybe suggest meeting to talk out what happened and take it from there? Though whatever you decide to do, I wish you all the best with your sobriety and in life.", "NTA. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a one time thing if you\u2019ve had to beg her not to throw you parties for you birthday. Your reaction was a bit over the top but drugs or no drugs you hate these things so I can assume your reaction would have been similar just without throwing up. \n\nIf you miss her - reach out. But be prepared for a negative experience because your sister sounds like an asshole.", "NTA. While I think you saying what you said was wrong, I don't think you qualify as an asshole for it. You were a kid struggling with a serious and dangerous condition. You were going through an insanely difficult time in your life and you reacted intensely to something upsetting happening to you. Obviously you shouldn't have said what you said, but given the factors I do not think you're an asshole for it.\n\nYour sister betrayed your trust and did something that you explicitly asked her several times not to do, something that she knew was scary and upsetting for you, but she did it anyway because SHE wanted it, and ended up humiliating you in front of other people and ruining your birthday. You mentioned how her crossing your boundaries was a recurring theme in your relationship. You were completely right to be upset and your intense reaction is (while not ideal) understandable given the circumstances.\n\nHowever, I do think you should seek her our and apologize. You deserve an apology too but I think it'd be better to make amends and try to repair your relationship with her.", "[deleted]", "NTA In fact, being estranged from your sister may be the right call. In fact, it\u2019s telling that you\u2019ve done better with sobriety since you\u2019ve been out of contact with your sister.\n\nIt is nothing short of sadistic to force a surprise party on someone who hates them. It\u2019s even more sadistic to surprise someone who is phobic of loud noises with twenty people screaming at once.\n\nIt\u2019s also awful that your sister blamed you for throwing up.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur sister is an abusive AH.", "What behavior? \nBeing surprised and throwing up in a matter she had no control over, organized by the person who knew the trauma response?", "Calling an addict an asshole for developing an addiction is horrifying in my opinion.You don't know how they developed an addiction. You know nothing about what happened to them. There isn't nearly enough context for us to be able to decide whether they're an asshole for how their addiction played out. Immediately jumping to call addicts assholes for developing a disease is harmful and contributes a lot to stigma around addiction, which makes recovery harder. Please in the future reconsider before saying something like this", "In addition to the other reply, I don\u2019t see how OP\u2019s behaviour could be interpreted as poor in the first place. They set a boundary and their sister knowingly violated it. Their addiction is irrelevant", "I agree with the other comments made to you. You can't just call someone, a teenager, an arsehole for getting addicted. Wtf.\nYou are an arsehole for doing arsehole things, like criticizing a person for their hardships without the full context, but making your own assumptions on what that context is.", "I clean led up the vomit.", "This is a very important perspective. A lot of people are crapping all over you OP for being an addict, but a minor doesn't get here by themselves.\n\nTake care of yourself, sounds like no one else is.", "I don\u2019t know man, I guess I was just hoping it wasn\u2019t as bad as it sounds.", "Do you really need to be so unnecessarily cruel to a teenager who struggled with a serious disease?", "OP is NTA - simply because the sister knew what she was doing, and that OP didn't want a birthday party.", "Good on you \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc. Do you want contact with your sister? Do you think it would be good for you at this point in time? She may not have changed. Though if you have other things you want to apologise for and get off your chest then go for it.", "Well it is bad if it's affecting your relationship.", "Don't listen to them", "NTA. You just graduated high school and this happened 2 years ago, so you were like 16? She\u2019s petty for holding on to that when you were having a hard time and you begged her multiple times not to throw you a party. What was she expecting? Also, where are your parents in this? Why did everyone agree to a surprise party when they knew you\u2019d probably hate it?", "NTA.. your sister is a toxic abusive AH", "NTA. Completely remove drugs from the equation. Your sister did something that she knew you didn't like and got mad at you for having an issue with it. I understand that she is family and you want a relationship with her, but I don't think right now is the right time. You are doing awesome! Keep going! Maybe talk to a therapist about the balloon trauma and how your sister made you feel. At some point you might be ready to talk to your sister. But I think you need some more time. I just hope that she is ready when you are. \nYou dug yourself out of a pretty crappy hole. That is just, I don't have words. This random internet stranger is very proud of you!", "NTA", "NTA I can't believe there are actually people calling you an AH for an involuntary response to something you specifically asked not to happen. While I think it might be a bit over the top saying you never want to see them again, it very well might not be, as it sounds like crossing the line is something your sister does often. Overall, addiction or not, sister is TA. I do think you should reach out and try to apologize for whatever you feel is necessary, but keep in mind your sister might not be receptive. Most importantly, congrats on your 1 year sober. Keep up the good work on your recovery, and I wish you all the best", "NTA. However, don't wait for her if you want a relationship with her. Even if she's TA, which she is, doesn't mean reaching out means you apologizing to her.\n\nShe seems to be taking you at your word, however, you can say you didn't mean to never see her again. Boundaries should be set, though. Best of luck", "Life is long and you are young. Prior to this event, was your sister overall a good element in your life?  Does the thought of being permanently estranged cause you grief? If so, reach out to clear the air. \n\nI don\u2019t think you have to (or should) apologize, other than possibly explain why your very justifiable panic caused you to react in a way that otherwise would seem overblown. It\u2019s up to you whether to also disclose that relapse, etc. NTA, but these grudges have a way of tearing the holder apart and the longer it goes, the harder it is. I have experienced this in my life.", "ESH\n\nyou for telling her <<I never wanted to see her again.>>\n\nShe for not respecting your right NOT to have a birthday party let alone a surprise one.\n\nHOWEVER, if you want a relationship with her then JUST APOLOGIZE for what you said, for hurting.  If you don't want one and don't give a darn about making amends for your addiction(if you do that treatment path) then don't apologize.\n\nShe owes you an apology too, but she has to decide to make it, you can't make that decision for her.", "My parents love both of us a bunch, but they usually take her side in arguments, but they decided to stay out of it this time.", "I think even if OP wasn\u2019t under the influence they would\u2019ve reacted the same way. Op had told their sister for years they didn\u2019t want a surprise birthday party and the sister stepped all over their boundaries just for something SHE WANTED and op didn\u2019t want due to her fear. I think minus drugs being in the equation, if she threw up and sister argued and yelled at her, she would\u2019ve acted the same way in a vulnerable state. \n\nWith your comment in mind, I hope when someone walks all over your boundaries and causes a reaction out of you that they knew would happen, you apologize to them and excuse their behavior.", "OP has nothing to apologize for though? What the sister did was entirely unjustifiable and cruel. NTA", "It was just a reaction on her part after telling her sister for years she didn\u2019t want a surprise party. I think you\u2019re missing the part where she told her sister that over and over. Op threw up due to the commotion and the sister yelled at her instead of letting her be or helping her. I think everything OP said and did besides the drugs was a reaction from what her sister did.\n\nYou can\u2019t expect OP to be in the right state of mind when she was thrown a surprise birthday party, puked, and then got yelled at, right?", "It's the sister who should make amends", "I mean, if they got addicted during high school, I have to believe there were a lot of other factors at play, and I would never assume that it was the fault of OP.", "Saying that someone is an asshole because of an addiction that they are working on and doing so well with, is the shittiest statement I have heard in a WHILE."]}
