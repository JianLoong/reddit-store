I don't see what else you can do.", "INFO Is there a reason the little girl doesn\u2019t want to go to school? If she was trying to avoid classmates she wouldn\u2019t want to go to the dance, but I just wonder what is going on at school.", "NTA\n\nYou set the consequences and she still decided she was \"sick\". Stick to your guns.", "You laid out clear choices with concrete consequences. NTA this is just good parenting.", "NTA\n\nNot too strict. If you are too sick for school, you're too sick for after school activities is totally appropriate. Eight is the time to start teaching that not only do actions have consequences, so do *choices*.\n\nSorry, you got stood up for the dance........", "NTA.  I think you and your wife need to be on the same page here and stay firm, that if you say something, you will follow through on it.\n\nThat said, you need to let her know that you were excited to go with her and will do something else together when she feels better, so she's certain she's not feeling rejected.   \n\nI think if you make it clear that you think it's impossible to be too sick to go to school and then be 100% better such a short time later, and that her symptoms might be relieved for now, but will likely be back, and it's too risky to go anywhere.    This may curb this pattern of behavior...but again, only if you and your wife are consistent about it.", "NTA\n\nNext time a very easy solution would be: \"Oh you feel better? Let's get you to class.\" My mom is a teacher and has this happened multiple times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActions have consequenses and even as a 8 year old it's important to learn", "Damn this is a tough one . I would try to figure out why she felt  she needs to lie . Was there a test or does she get bullied . Normally kids like to go to school to meet their friends and she is 8 so I would try to get to the buttom of this. Are the teachers mean ? Are the subjects to hard ?\n\nOr is she heart broken because her real dad doesn't care about her ?  Try to figure out her reason and then you can tell if she deserves a father  daughter dance or not . It would be indeed sad if she miss a moment to bond with you because of something she  didn't fully understood . Maybe she did indeed felt a lot fo pressure and anxiety to go to school . They don't lie for no reason", "Yta.  Take her to school and go to the dance. \n\nHave a big talk with her about why she is trying to get out of school.  I suggest to do it while driving so that you are not making eye contact as that makes it easier for her open up.  You should speak to the school nurse to let them know what is going on or she may end up back in the nurses office.   Also for future make sure when she is home sick it is not a fun time.  No tv. No iPad. No phone.  Instead she lays in bed with lights off and all quiet.  Sometimes the fake illness is for the fun of it.", "NTA\n\nGet her to school the moment she says she feels better, dance or not. She will soon learn she has to pretend all day or just suck it up and go. \n\nWork with her teacher to identify why she's wanting to avoid school. Is she struggling with a particular subject or having to sit beside someone who's not compatible? There are lots of things that could be affecting her and it's worth investigating.", "I have to agree with the other YTAs. Since this is a regular occurrence, I think there's something more going on here. Instead of punishing her, you need to talk with her and figure out what's wrong. Yes, I know, some kids just don't like school, but there's frequently a deeper reason.", "NTA this is good parenting. But why is she pretending to be sick so often? I get once in a while but the way you worded it makes me think something might be going on at school causing her to not want to go?", "NTA. My kid pulls this stuff too. Even when he's genuinely sick he will \"recover\" and want to do xyz. \n\nBesides I doubt the school will appreciate you bringing a kid who missed school if it was called out as an illness. \n\nActions have consequences. Maybe she does have anxiety about school though that needs a deeper conversation.\n\nEdit word", "Meh nah. Kids aren\u2019t robots. Just because they learn that they got a break one time doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll stop going to school. Long term teach that she can take a mental health day. It won\u2019t ruin things.", "NTA\n\nBut not handling this the best way. 1 hour after school started she felt fine..Take her to school. She has missed 1/2 the morning session she can do the rest of the day. \n\nThis didn't need to be a one or other situation. She could have gone in and still be able to go to the dance. \n\nThings you can also do/say. \n\nIf you are too sick for school you have to stay in bed. \n\nNo TV or tech it's not good for your eyes... you can read a book \n\nBland food...\n\nLimit attention \n\nIf a child is genuinely sick all of this will be OK with them. If they are playing you up they are going to be bored senseless and going to school will seem like the better option.", "NTA but if she really wants to go to the dance I'd take her but give her some other form of punishment, like no electronics all day or something. Don't make it another memory her classmates have that she doesn't. \nIf you really don't want to back down do some special with her tonight anyway. Go to the movies (or let her pick one at home) or take her out for a dinner just you and her, anything she'll enjoy that she can do with just you. That way she still understands that you mean what you say.", "YWBTA. \n\nNormally I'm 100% behind the policy that if you're too sick to go to school, you're too sick for many other fun activities.\n\nFirst, does the child appear well? Did you take her to the doctor? \n\nHowever, it sounds like you should consider an exception in this case. As a stepparent, the opportunities to be fully part of a child's world are limited. She has invited you and claimed you are her daddy. You need to honor that love that she's showing, and build on the trust she's extending.\n\nFurther, if she's experiencing extreme anxiety over school on a regular basis, you and her mother should look into what's going on at school and what you can do to help her. It may be a situation with another student or teacher, and her distress sounds very real. Or she may have a medical issue you don't know about yet that's causing the pain. Best to look into this for her. \n\nFor now, offer little flexibility and grace, and go enjoy your time together.", "NTA. She is old enough to understand that actions have consequences. You both laid out the terms and she indicated that she understood. I can respect that her mother feels bad, but that would be setting a dangerous precedent for the future. It's important at any age that consequences be enforced and that both parental figures on the same page. \n\nPerhaps if you feel bad, you can plan a day together with her and do something fun, like get pedicures or go to a museum and get ice cream.", "Can she not be taken to class late? And no NTA. She's going to need to learn that lesson unfortunately. It was made clear and she understood.", "NTA. But what\u2019s going on at school? Is it anxiety? Bullying?", "NTA, You should have taken her into school late.  But you set the rules for her and she knew the consequences.", "NTA consistency is key. Your gf set boundaries and needs to stick to them. A father daughter dance is important especially for a little girl who\u2019s bio dad is unreliable but in this context sometimes being a reliable parent means sticking to consequences.", "NTA. This is normal behavior for this age but actions have consequences. Fwiw, you guys should try and find out if she\u2019s being bullied or trying to avoid something at school.", "I don't think anybody is the AH here, BUT she is only eight. I would wonder if she's having trouble with her first class...  Get to the bottom of that before she gets any older. My parents refused to allow me to go to a middle school dance (I don't remember why) and then they felt bad and went upstairs to tell me I could go. I had already left. Then they went to the school, I saw them, and ran away. That's how important social events can be to a kid so make sure your punishment actually fits the crime.", "NTA but she should probably see a counselor/doctor for that! (For saying that she feels sick regularly ie) It could be the sign of something significant, like childhood anxiety", "NTA.\n but a lot more needs to be done other than just making her stay home.", "NTA- but I would talk to her and find out if there\u2019s a reason she wants to skip school so much, like an issue with bullying.", "NTA, when you cave, you teach them that you will cave.  Parenting is the hardest.  You second guess everything.   You always wonder if you did the right thing.  My kids are all in their 20s and I still question things.  You are doing great.  She's lucky to have a step dad who cares enough to be strict.", "NTA, but it might be wise to get SD into therapy.  This is a fairly loud distress signal from a child her age.", "NTA You shouldn't have let her stay home in the first place if she has no symptoms of illness knowing she lies to you about it. Stick to your guns so she knows there's consequences for lying", "NTA, if that's what her mother decided, then I think you should follow her lead. Actions have consequences, and she was warned. There's always next year", "NTA- but you should check to see if your step-daughter has any learning difficulties. Studies have shown students who struggle in school will often \u201cget sick\u201d to avoid doing work they know they are unable to complete unlike their peers.", "NTA\n\nYou made a deal and need to follow through with consequences. In fact, drop her off at school!", "NAH.\nYou know your kid better than we do.\nWhen I was young I used to get out of going to school by making a deal with my dad. I\u2019d do chores all day until they were done/school ended, and he\u2019d call out for me. I kinda abused that deal lol.\n\nI also used to fake not feeling well so I could stay home. I was bullied, and struggled, but those weren\u2019t really the reasons why I wanted to skip. I just didn\u2019t care for classes like any typical child throwing a minor tantrum. \n\nBut there were also times I\u2019d feel like total trash. Even now, actually! I call out of work at 5 am because I am just too fucking sick for anything. Couple hours later? It\u2019s miraculously gone. Sometimes I tough it out and other days I don\u2019t. \n\nI think letting her earn her way into the school dance by going back to school wouldn\u2019t have been a bad idea. But I\u2019m also on board with your plan now, teaching consequences. You\u2019re both doing okay and you seem to have your head on your shoulders. \n\nAs a quick sidenote, you said this was a running theme with her. Is it always one hour after school? Look for a pattern. Maybe there\u2019s a problem with her schedule during that particular part of the day. You know your kid.", "YTA\n\nIf she says she feels better, *take her to school*\n\nSometimes kids say they are sick because they are dealing with stress or something emotionally. You lead your story with the fact that her father is absent and she had weird feelings about the dance tonight.\n\nBut if you know she doesn\u2019t have Covid or something she can pass on to other kids, she probably internalized the consequences and wants to go to the dance. \n\nShe may have been feeling a lot of stress about dad vs stepdad at dance. Maybe she felt weird about how other kids would react. Maybe she had big sad feelings about her dad not being there. I definitely did growing up, and stress and anxiety gave me stomach problems.\n\nDon\u2019t punish her for communicating the only way she knows how; she\u2019s only 8 years old.\n\nI feel bad for her.", "Im torn here. On one hand she knew what she was doing and she still decided not to go to school. On the other hand\u2026. Shes 8. And also your step daughter. Moments like this really impact relationships heavily. When shes older she is either going to remember an amazing bonding night between you two, or the night all of the other little girls got to dance with their dads and she was at home. \n\nYou say she has a rocky relationship with her own dad which was probably making her nervous about going with you. That\u2019s probably what made her feel unwell in the morning.", "If you really want to help her, you should investigate what is making her want to miss school so much.  That has a more lasting consequence than missing the father-daughter dance. \n\nSoft YTA for not seeing the forest for the trees. \n\nNot sure that your punishment is going to cause her to suddenly stop faking illness.  And if you are certain that she has been faking, why haven't you forced her to go to school when she says that she is not feeling well.", "NTA. But ask if she wants to go to school and if she refuses, stand your ground. The people acting like this is some mental anguish instead of teaching a lesson need to get a grip", "NTA \n\nShe knew the consequences of missing school. That is good parenting. If she\u2019s too sick for school, too sick for school sponsored dance. \n\nIs there something else going on at school, though that she keeps feeling better after it starts? Such as bullying or anxiety? Or a hated teacher she has first?", "If you keep her home then NTA. Our schools don't let you participate in school functions if you weren't at school. However I'd be taking her in to class if she feels better. I'd take them all the way til a couple hours before dismissal.", "NAH. My parents did the same thing to me as a kid. If you're too sick for school, you're too sick for fun. But I also feel like y'all need to question more why she's so reluctant to go. Eight years old is pretty young to already be making a habit of this.", "after only an hour I would have just sent her to school then. NTA though", "NTA, she needs to understand consequences for her actions. \n\nWith that being said, she should also be evaluated for something more serious. If she\u2019s regularly lying about being sick to get out of school, it might be something more than just a kid not wanting to go. I lied to get out of school and it turns out I was majorly depressed.", "NTA. This is how many kids learn unfortunately", "NTA\n\nWe also had the rule that too sick for school meant too sick for any extra curriculars, having friends over or \"fun\" stuff the rest of the day. You could lie in bed and watch TV, sleep or read. Or work on homework assignments. \n\nSounds like your stepdaughter knows how to get out of going to school and unless there is some documented illness (migraines or something she's being treated for by a doctor) that won't show up, she should not be allowed to stay home unless she has a fever over 100 or is throwing up. I think by allowing her to not attend school, and then get to go to fun things like dances the same evening, you are teaching the wrong lesson. It would be painful the first couple of times, but if you made her miss out on these fun activities, she would quickly learn only to stay home sick when she is actually really sick. And again, you and her mother need to be more vigilant about what is actually \"too sick to attend school.\" There are probably plenty of times you don't feel your best and still go into work, right? No fever and no throwing up, in the absence of a documented medical condition she's being treated for, means she should be going in to school.", "INFO: What is going on at school to make the kid lie to get out of it? Smells like bullying to me.", "NTA. you made the consequences clear and she still malingered.", "As a student I feel bad that her plan failed, but NTA, she can\u2019t just skip class and get off scott free. This is good parenting. She knew the risks.", "NAH here. Y'all school doesn't allow late entrance? If there is a way to let her earn it back, I'd do it.", "NTA. There's no point to rules unless you follow through with consequences. She's at an impressionable age and enforcing boundaries on small things now will pay off in dividends later. Your stepdaughter is allowed to be sad but you clearly communicated the consequences of lying. Following through will reinforce the boundary set as something she must abide and not something she can change because it's mildly inconvenient for her.", "NTA. This is a case of \u201cthere are consequences to your actions\u201d, she was told what the consequences would be so now you need to follow through so that she learns.", "Social pressure and absent parents aren\u2019t a game; they are very stressful for young children. Children also don\u2019t think through consequences at the rate adults do.\n\nDespite her reservations or embarrassment over having a dad who isn\u2019t around and having to ask her step dad, she realized what she was losing out on and said she felt better. Maybe her tummy really did hurt or she had a headache thinking about the situation. She also realized she wanted to go to the dance.\n\nIf you want to stick to the letter, take her to school an hour late! If not, have empathy for a child who is asking for help emotionally the way she knows how\u2026 she wasn\u2019t feeling well. Now she was trying to feel better, so she wouldn\u2019t be left out.\n\nI am just a little floored people don\u2019t get this.", "He is standing up the girl with a dead-beat father\u2026\n\nShe wanted to go to school because she is coping with not having her dad around, but probably feeling socially embarrassed. She probably also realized she wanted to be where all her friends and classmates will also be\n\nNow she is being punished and will also stick out like a sore thumb not just for not having her \u201creal dad\u201d around, but for not going to the dance period\n\nShe\u2019s 8 years old, my goodness", "Hey, just as a heads up, I wouldn't use the term \"real\" dad. OP is her real dad as he's the one who is there for her. Other dude would just be bio dad.", "This is similar to what we do. Staying home sick is for resting and getting better. My kids all know it isn\u2019t a fun free for all. They only ask to stay home if they really need it.", "Whenever we were sick growing up, we were allowed dry toast and tea. Occasionally a vernor\u2019s if we were not too bad but still too sick to go to school in my parents\u2019 opinion. But that was it. And if we stayed home, no fun things that night, no sleepovers, no soccer games, nada. If it was a Friday, no fun things that weekend. We were home, trapped on the living room couch where my parents could supervise us until they decided we were better. \n\nNeedless to say, we faked sick maybe like twice before realizing they wouldn\u2019t crack and that was the end of it.", "She is anxious about a daddy daughter dance and her dad is a deadbeat. She was going to have to go with someone who isn\u2019t her dad.\n\nThen she realized she wouldn\u2019t be able to go be with her friends and tried to change course (\u201cI feel better\u201d = go to school), but shes not going to get to go, so she\u2019s going to be punished and also socially alienated (not at the parent dance) anyway\n\nIt\u2019s sad and step dad/mom\u2019s boyfriend and mom could help support her through these feelings in a productive way. Instead this is just sticking to a rule.", "This should end up on top.", "I wish I could give an award, this needs to be highlighted", "THIS!!!! Im sure at 8 its hard to process why your real dad doesn\u2019t want to go to the dance with you. That\u2019s enough to give any kid a stomach ache. Now she doesnt get to go with either dad", "And sometimes kids say their sick because they don't want to go to school. Not everything has a hidden meaning behind it. I hatred school and was always trying to get out of going.", "Moments like this? You mean discipline? She\u2019s a smart girl. She knew exactly what she was doing and banked on them not holding up their end of the agreement. This will teach her she can manipulate a situation as she sees fit.", "I agree, I wonder (but i certainly hope this isn\u2019t the case) if this kiddo is being bullied. Because unfortunately, most schools aren\u2019t known for being vigilant or helpful when it comes to bullying/ harassment.", "Ok on the flip side I was a little shit when I was kid and would complain multiple times a week that my \"stomach hurt\" knowing damn well I just wanted to stay home and play NHL on N64.

Come on. You read an awful lot into this.", "Instead of realizing there are other parental figures who can stand in when you want them (a daddy-daughter dance), the lesson will be that her stress will be misunderstood, and if she can\u2019t get with the program fast enough, she\u2019ll be left out.\n\nHer friends will ask about her at the dance, and it will call more attention to her dad situation.\n\nShe also realized this (probably) and wanted to go to school.\n\nPoor kid", "OP is the one who highlighted her father\u2019s absence, so it probably has an impact on the story and her feelings about the situation.

I went to my frist father/daughter dance with my youngest daughter less than two weeks of her and her siblings being placed with me as foster kids.  It is a memory I treasure more than a decade later.  I asked her a few years ago if she remembered us going to the dance and she got a great big grin on her face.  It was just as precious to her as it was to me even though we were still figuring out life together.  Be better", "Well....NTA....but I think this dance is a little more important than a regular function and it would be a shame for both of you to miss it. Explain to her this is a one off and will not happen again. This might also be a golden opportunity for you to find out why she wants to stay home from school. Kids sometimes go through a period like that when they discover they can get sent home but sometimes there's more to it. But go to the dance, I think you'll both be sorry if you miss it.", "NTA and if it's any consolation, a fair number of schools have similar rules for their evening events - you can't go to the End-of-Term School Disco if you were off sick that day.\n\nThis was certainly the policy when I was a boy, and it's the case at my kids' schools too", "NTA - Kids pull this stuff, it\u2019s not unusual, one of our daughters did this too.

She's going to keep doing it if you let her stay home.", "Verdict aside, I would sit her down and ask her if something is troubling her. Kids tend to say they are sick to avoid stressful situations.\n\nI did because I was bullied in school.\n\nBtw I genuinely had an upset stomach, including throwing up. But it was still caused by my brain and nothing was actually wrong with me. Hence it got better fast after school.", "NTA. The school might not even let her attend because she was out sick.", "NTA, but if this fairly common, I\u2019d take her to her doctor. I only say this because my grandson has had such terrible anxiety from a young age (6), now with therapy, compassion from his teachers and family of course, he\u2019s 13 and while still not completely comfortable going to school is much much better.

If you\u2019re too sick to go to school, you\u2019re too sick to go out at all.

Whatever it is, OP and wife need to probe further-and maybe they have, can\u2019t always tell from the posts, but if so, a little more digging seems to be called for.", "Idk if it helps or not, but is it possible that she is feeling unwell so often due to stress about going to school and/or lack of sleep, so staying home and resting helps her feel better?\n\nI know she is young, but maybe it could be healthy for you as parents and for her as she learns to take care of herself to warrant her something like 2-3 \"mental health\" days per semester or quarter where if she needs to stay home and rest, recoup, etc. she can and you'll all support it.\n\nThere is NOTHING in school she will miss, but there is much to be lost if you don't start teaching her asap how to take good care of herself. I'm not encouraging that she shirk responsibility, but that she learns to balance outside responsibility (school, future jobs, etc.) with the responsibility she needs to learn to take care of all aspects of her health.\n\nHow many times do we sometimes need or long for a sick day, when we maybe don't \"feel sick\", but are just absolutely drained physically, mentally, and/or emotionally? I've done it from time to time, and felt sooooo much better when I returned to work or school, that I was more productive and learned more than if I hadn't missed a day at all.", "NTA - idk why people are saying to take her to school when (at least here in england) if you tell the school ur child is sick they will absolutely NOT let you bring them in halfway through the day claiming they are \u2018better\u2019", "I'm so glad you had a blast! \n\nJust my 2cents:\nWhen I was in school, starting in elementary I'd get really sick, get sent home, grab a snack and then all of a sudden feel better... All the way to high school... Took till I was 26 to find out I have a heart condition, and that the salt in my snacks was helping my heart regulate. \n\nIt's not always that they are faking it, it could be an underlying issue you just haven't nailed down yet \ud83d\udc9c", "Having a safe adult with you makes you safe, so the classmates can't hurt you is my reasoning for why dance was still an option. And sometimes you bite the bullet as a kid just to get to experience the special things.", "That's instantly what I thought. I was bullied in school, teased and beaten, and would fake being sick to get away from bullies. Time for a heart to heart with Miss 8. NTA", "yeah my sister does this sometimes bc she feels like shit about how smart she is (even though her grades are quite good and she gets good reports) and always compares herself to everyone\n\nwe don\u2019t let her though", "Yes, the symptom being she doesn't like going to school. Have all of you forgotten what it was like to be a kid and how much BS you tried to pull to get out of things you didn't want to do?", "I couldn't tell you the last sick day I have taken ( I luckily dont get sick often) but I can tell you that most of my coworkers definitely call off at least once a month if not more often (I do take my pto, of course) .", "\"Disastrous consequences\" seems very dramatic. My state even allows for students to have a set amount of mental health days per year."]}
