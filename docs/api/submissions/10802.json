If she was trying to avoid classmates she wouldn\u2019t want to go to the dance, but I just wonder what is going on at school.", "NTA\n\nYou set the consequences and she still decided she was \"sick\". Stick to your guns.", "You laid out clear choices with concrete consequences. NTA this is just good parenting.", "NTA\n\nNot too strict. If you are too sick for school, you're too sick for after school activities is totally appropriate. Eight is the time to start teaching that not only do actions have consequences, so do *choices*.\n\nSorry, you got stood up for the dance........", "NTA.  I think you and your wife need to be on the same page here and stay firm, that if you say something, you will follow through on it.\n\nThat said, you need to let her know that you were excited to go with her and will do something else together when she feels better, so she's certain she's not feeling rejected.   \n\nI think if you make it clear that you think it's impossible to be too sick to go to school and then be 100% better such a short time later, and that her symptoms might be relieved for now, but will likely be back, and it's too risky to go anywhere.    This may curb this pattern of behavior...but again, only if you and your wife are consistent about it.", "NTA\n\nNext time a very easy solution would be: \"Oh you feel better? Let's get you to class.\" My mom is a teacher and has this happened multiple times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActions have consequenses and even as a 8 year old it's important to learn", "Damn this is a tough one . I would try to figure out why she felt  she needs to lie . Was there a test or does she get bullied . Normally kids like to go to school to meet their friends and she is 8 so I would try to get to the buttom of this. Are the teachers mean ? Are the subjects to hard ?\n\nOr is she heart broken because her real dad doesn't care about her ?  Try to figure out her reason and then you can tell if she deserves a father  daughter dance or not . It would be indeed sad if she miss a moment to bond with you because of something she  didn't fully understood . Maybe she did indeed felt a lot fo pressure and anxiety to go to school . They don't lie for no reason", "Yta.  Take her to school and go to the dance. \n\nHave a big talk with her about why she is trying to get out of school.  I suggest to do it while driving so that you are not making eye contact as that makes it easier for her open up.  You should speak to the school nurse to let them know what is going on or she may end up back in the nurses office.   Also for future make sure when she is home sick it is not a fun time.  No tv. No iPad. No phone.  Instead she lays in bed with lights off and all quiet.  Sometimes the fake illness is for the fun of it.", "NTA\n\nGet her to school the moment she says she feels better, dance or not. She will soon learn she has to pretend all day or just suck it up and go. \n\nWork with her teacher to identify why she's wanting to avoid school. Is she struggling with a particular subject or having to sit beside someone who's not compatible? There are lots of things that could be affecting her and it's worth investigating.", "I have to agree with the other YTAs. Since this is a regular occurrence, I think there's something more going on here. Instead of punishing her, you need to talk with her and figure out what's wrong. Yes, I know, some kids just don't like school, but there's frequently a deeper reason.", "NTA this is good parenting. But why is she pretending to be sick so often? I get once in a while but the way you worded it makes me think something might be going on at school causing her to not want to go?", "NTA. My kid pulls this stuff too. Even when he's genuinely sick he will \"recover\" and want to do xyz. \n\nBesides I doubt the school will appreciate you bringing a kid who missed school if it was called out as an illness. \n\nActions have consequences. Maybe she does have anxiety about school though that needs a deeper conversation.\n\nEdit word", "Meh nah. Kids aren\u2019t robots. Just because they learn that they got a break one time doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll stop going to school. Long term teach that she can take a mental health day. It won\u2019t ruin things.", "NTA\n\nBut not handling this the best way. 1 hour after school started she felt fine..Take her to school. She has missed 1/2 the morning session she can do the rest of the day. \n\nThis didn't need to be a one or other situation. She could have gone in and still be able to go to the dance. \n\nThings you can also do/say. \n\nIf you are too sick for school you have to stay in bed. \n\nNo TV or tech it's not good for your eyes... you can read a book \n\nBland food...\n\nLimit attention \n\nIf a child is genuinely sick all of this will be OK with them. If they are playing you up they are going to be bored senseless and going to school will seem like the better option.", "NTA but if she really wants to go to the dance I'd take her but give her some other form of punishment, like no electronics all day or something. Don't make it another memory her classmates have that she doesn't. \nIf you really don't want to back down do some special with her tonight anyway. Go to the movies (or let her pick one at home) or take her out for a dinner just you and her, anything she'll enjoy that she can do with just you. That way she still understands that you mean what you say.", "YWBTA. \n\nNormally I'm 100% behind the policy that if you're too sick to go to school, you're too sick for many other fun activities.\n\nFirst, does the child appear well? Did you take her to the doctor? \n\nHowever, it sounds like you should consider an exception in this case. As a stepparent, the opportunities to be fully part of a child's world are limited. She has invited you and claimed you are her daddy. You need to honor that love that she's showing, and build on the trust she's extending.\n\nFurther, if she's experiencing extreme anxiety over school on a regular basis, you and her mother should look into what's going on at school and what you can do to help her. It may be a situation with another student or teacher, and her distress sounds very real. Or she may have a medical issue you don't know about yet that's causing the pain. Best to look into this for her. \n\nFor now, offer little flexibility and grace, and go enjoy your time together.", "NTA. She is old enough to understand that actions have consequences. You both laid out the terms and she indicated that she understood. I can respect that her mother feels bad, but that would be setting a dangerous precedent for the future. It's important at any age that consequences be enforced and that both parental figures on the same page. \n\nPerhaps if you feel bad, you can plan a day together with her and do something fun, like get pedicures or go to a museum and get ice cream.", "Can she not be taken to class late? And no NTA. She's going to need to learn that lesson unfortunately. It was made clear and she understood.", "NTA. But what\u2019s going on at school? Is it anxiety? Bullying?", "NTA, You should have taken her into school late.  But you set the rules for her and she knew the consequences.", "NTA consistency is key. Your gf set boundaries and needs to stick to them. A father daughter dance is important especially for a little girl who\u2019s bio dad is unreliable but in this context sometimes being a reliable parent means sticking to consequences.", "NTA. This is normal behavior for this age but actions have consequences. Fwiw, you guys should try and find out if she\u2019s being bullied or trying to avoid something at school.", "I don't think anybody is the AH here, BUT she is only eight. I would wonder if she's having trouble with her first class...  Get to the bottom of that before she gets any older. My parents refused to allow me to go to a middle school dance (I don't remember why) and then they felt bad and went upstairs to tell me I could go. I had already left. Then they went to the school, I saw them, and ran away. That's how important social events can be to a kid so make sure your punishment actually fits the crime.", "NTA but she should probably see a counselor/doctor for that! (For saying that she feels sick regularly ie) It could be the sign of something significant, like childhood anxiety", "NTA.\n but a lot more needs to be done other than just making her stay home.", "NTA- but I would talk to her and find out if there\u2019s a reason she wants to skip school so much, like an issue with bullying.", "NTA, when you cave, you teach them that you will cave.  Parenting is the hardest.  You second guess everything.   You always wonder if you did the right thing.  My kids are all in their 20s and I still question things.  You are doing great.  She's lucky to have a step dad who cares enough to be strict.", "NTA, but it might be wise to get SD into therapy.  This is a fairly loud distress signal from a child her age.", "NTA You shouldn't have let her stay home in the first place if she has no symptoms of illness knowing she lies to you about it. Stick to your guns so she knows there's consequences for lying", "NTA, if that's what her mother decided, then I think you should follow her lead. Actions have consequences, and she was warned. There's always next year", "NTA- but you should check to see if your step-daughter has any learning difficulties. Studies have shown students who struggle in school will often \u201cget sick\u201d to avoid doing work they know they are unable to complete unlike their peers.", "NTA\n\nYou made a deal and need to follow through with consequences. In fact, drop her off at school!", "NAH.\nYou know your kid better than we do.\nWhen I was young I used to get out of going to school by making a deal with my dad. I\u2019d do chores all day until they were done/school ended, and he\u2019d call out for me. I kinda abused that deal lol.\n\nI also used to fake not feeling well so I could stay home. I was bullied, and struggled, but those weren\u2019t really the reasons why I wanted to skip. I just didn\u2019t care for classes like any typical child throwing a minor tantrum. \n\nBut there were also times I\u2019d feel like total trash. Even now, actually! I call out of work at 5 am because I am just too fucking sick for anything. Couple hours later? It\u2019s miraculously gone. Sometimes I tough it out and other days I don\u2019t. \n\nI think letting her earn her way into the school dance by going back to school wouldn\u2019t have been a bad idea. But I\u2019m also on board with your plan now, teaching consequences. You\u2019re both doing okay and you seem to have your head on your shoulders. \n\nAs a quick sidenote, you said this was a running theme with her. Is it always one hour after school? Look for a pattern. Maybe there\u2019s a problem with her schedule during that particular part of the day. You know your kid.", "YTA\n\nIf she says she feels better, *take her to school*\n\nSometimes kids say they are sick because they are dealing with stress or something emotionally. You lead your story with the fact that her father is absent and she had weird feelings about the dance tonight.\n\nBut if you know she doesn\u2019t have Covid or something she can pass on to other kids, she probably internalized the consequences and wants to go to the dance. \n\nShe may have been feeling a lot of stress about dad vs stepdad at dance. Maybe she felt weird about how other kids would react. Maybe she had big sad feelings about her dad not being there. I definitely did growing up, and stress and anxiety gave me stomach problems.\n\nDon\u2019t punish her for communicating the only way she knows how; she\u2019s only 8 years old.\n\nI feel bad for her.", "Im torn here. On one hand she knew what she was doing and she still decided not to go to school. On the other hand\u2026. Shes 8. And also your step daughter. Moments like this really impact relationships heavily. When shes older she is either going to remember an amazing bonding night between you two, or the night all of the other little girls got to dance with their dads and she was at home. \n\nYou say she has a rocky relationship with her own dad which was probably making her nervous about going with you. That\u2019s probably what made her feel unwell in the morning.", "If you really want to help her, you should investigate what is making her want to miss school so much.  That has a more lasting consequence than missing the father-daughter dance. \n\nSoft YTA for not seeing the forest for the trees. \n\nNot sure that your punishment is going to cause her to suddenly stop faking illness.  And if you are certain that she has been faking, why haven't you forced her to go to school when she says that she is not feeling well.", "NTA. But ask if she wants to go to school and if she refuses, stand your ground. The people acting like this is some mental anguish instead of teaching a lesson need to get a grip", "NTA \n\nShe knew the consequences of missing school. That is good parenting. If she\u2019s too sick for school, too sick for school sponsored dance. \n\nIs there something else going on at school, though that she keeps feeling better after it starts? Such as bullying or anxiety? Or a hated teacher she has first?", "If you keep her home then NTA. Our schools don't let you participate in school functions if you weren't at school. However I'd be taking her in to class if she feels better. I'd take them all the way til a couple hours before dismissal.", "NAH. My parents did the same thing to me as a kid. If you're too sick for school, you're too sick for fun. But I also feel like y'all need to question more why she's so reluctant to go. Eight years old is pretty young to already be making a habit of this.", "after only an hour I would have just sent her to school then. NTA though", "NTA, she needs to understand consequences for her actions. \n\nWith that being said, she should also be evaluated for something more serious. If she\u2019s regularly lying about being sick to get out of school, it might be something more than just a kid not wanting to go. I lied to get out of school and it turns out I was majorly depressed.", "NTA. This is how many kids learn unfortunately", "NTA\n\nWe also had the rule that too sick for school meant too sick for any extra curriculars, having friends over or \"fun\" stuff the rest of the day. You could lie in bed and watch TV, sleep or read. Or work on homework assignments. \n\nSounds like your stepdaughter knows how to get out of going to school and unless there is some documented illness (migraines or something she's being treated for by a doctor) that won't show up, she should not be allowed to stay home unless she has a fever over 100 or is throwing up. I think by allowing her to not attend school, and then get to go to fun things like dances the same evening, you are teaching the wrong lesson. It would be painful the first couple of times, but if you made her miss out on these fun activities, she would quickly learn only to stay home sick when she is actually really sick. And again, you and her mother need to be more vigilant about what is actually \"too sick to attend school.\" There are probably plenty of times you don't feel your best and still go into work, right? No fever and no throwing up, in the absence of a documented medical condition she's being treated for, means she should be going in to school.", "INFO: What is going on at school to make the kid lie to get out of it? Smells like bullying to me.", "NTA. you made the consequences clear and she still malingered.", "As a student I feel bad that her plan failed, but NTA, she can\u2019t just skip class and get off scott free. This is good parenting. She knew the risks.", "NAH here. Y'all school doesn't allow late entrance? If there is a way to let her earn it back, I'd do it.", "NTA. There's no point to rules unless you follow through with consequences. She's at an impressionable age and enforcing boundaries on small things now will pay off in dividends later. Your stepdaughter is allowed to be sad but you clearly communicated the consequences of lying. Following through will reinforce the boundary set as something she must abide and not something she can change because it's mildly inconvenient for her.", "NTA. This is a case of \u201cthere are consequences to your actions\u201d, she was told what the consequences would be so now you need to follow through so that she learns.", "Social pressure and absent parents aren\u2019t a game; they are very stressful for young children. Children also don\u2019t think through consequences at the rate adults do.\n\nDespite her reservations or embarrassment over having a dad who isn\u2019t around and having to ask her step dad, she realized what she was losing out on and said she felt better. Maybe her tummy really did hurt or she had a headache thinking about the situation. She also realized she wanted to go to the dance.\n\nIf you want to stick to the letter, take her to school an hour late! If not, have empathy for a child who is asking for help emotionally the way she knows how\u2026 she wasn\u2019t feeling well. Now she was trying to feel better, so she wouldn\u2019t be left out.\n\nI am just a little floored people don\u2019t get this.", "He is standing up the girl with a dead-beat father\u2026\n\nShe wanted to go to school because she is coping with not having her dad around, but probably feeling socially embarrassed. She probably also realized she wanted to be where all her friends and classmates will also be\n\nNow she is being punished and will also stick out like a sore thumb not just for not having her \u201creal dad\u201d around, but for not going to the dance period\n\nShe\u2019s 8 years old, my goodness", "Hey, just as a heads up, I wouldn't use the term \"real\" dad. OP is her real dad as he's the one who is there for her. Other dude would just be bio dad.", "This is similar to what we do. Staying home sick is for resting and getting better.

Occasionally a vernor\u2019s if we were not too bad but still too sick to go to school in my parents\u2019 opinion. But that was it. And if we stayed home, no fun things that night, no sleepovers, no soccer games, nada. If it was a Friday, no fun things that weekend. We were home, trapped on the living room couch where my parents could supervise us until they decided we were better. \n\nNeedless to say, we faked sick maybe like twice before realizing they wouldn\u2019t crack and that was the end of it.", "She is anxious about a daddy daughter dance and her dad is a deadbeat. She was going to have to go with someone who isn\u2019t her dad.\n\nThen she realized she wouldn\u2019t be able to go be with her friends and tried to change course (\u201cI feel better\u201d = go to school), but shes not going to get to go, so she\u2019s going to be punished and also socially alienated (not at the parent dance) anyway\n\nIt\u2019s sad and step dad/mom\u2019s boyfriend and mom could help support her through these feelings in a productive way.

I hatred school and was always trying to get out of going.", "Moments like this? You mean discipline? She\u2019s a smart girl.

This will teach her she can manipulate a situation as she sees fit.", "I agree, I wonder (but i certainly hope this isn\u2019t the case) if this kiddo is being bullied. Because unfortunately, most schools aren\u2019t known for being vigilant or helpful when it comes to bullying/ harassment.", "Ok on the flip side I was a little shit when I was kid and would complain multiple times a week that my \"stomach hurt\" knowing damn well I just wanted to stay home and play NHL on N64.

It is a memory I treasure more than a decade later.  I asked her a few years ago if she remembered us going to the dance and she got a great big grin on her face.  It was just as precious to her as it was to me even though we were still figuring out life together.  Be better", "Well....NTA....but I think this dance is a little more important than a regular function and it would be a shame for both of you to miss it. Explain to her this is a one off and will not happen again. This might also be a golden opportunity for you to find out why she wants to stay home from school.

Ok, you missed one or two lessons in the morning but then got better, so go to school.\n\nAnd all the rest. Can't go to school and there's a whiff of the performing shits? No problem. I'm so sorry you're not feeling well, stay in bed, lights on low, no phone, no TV. The miraculous recoveries were marvels to behold.\n\n(When they were legit sick they wouldn't have the energy for anything anyway for the first day or two and I'd allow screen time after that).\n\nNTA and I hope she gets the work done so you can still make the dance \ud83d\udc9e", "i mean when i was 8 i didnt wanna go to school cos it was school lol", "You mentioning your son wanting to do xyz even though he is sick unlocked a now hilarious but at the time embarrassing memory for me involving throwing up on myself after I insisted on eating cinnamon toast even though I had a stomach bug. I don't think my mom believed that I was feeling better but I think she was thinking whatever maybe she will learn something.\ud83d\ude02 My sister never let me live it down! My parents laughed at me and made me clean myself up (didn't you say you were feeling better? You can clean that up.) \n\nIn retrospect that was some parenting 3d chess", "I was thinking maybe the daughter is being bullied. I was like this when I was younger & being bullied. I also acted like this when I had mono. So, a doctor\u2019s appt and a good talk can do wonders.", "That is actually true, isn\u2019t it. I guess I do recall pretending like I had \u201csprained \u201c my ankle just to go home and watch TV:)", "Now if that is information that is being left out, 100%. Sadly, I was the little girl who had no present father but my step father at the time was also pretty absent, so I truly do understand (somewhat) what she's going through on that part. \n\nI was also a kid who once I realized I could say \"I'm sick\" and get out of school I would use it when I didn't want to go. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I also had parents that would tell me the exact same thing \"if you are truly sick, stay home but you can't feel better in an hour and go to friends house this evening\" (or whatever). I'd 'feel better' later and want to go do the fun activity and my mother would not allow me to do/go said fun activity. Didn't matter my age, shed laid down a rule/word and it needed to be followed. I quickly learned that I had to keep up my end to do fun stuff. \n\nNever said I didn't have empathy for a child. Just based on the little bit of info that was given, I gave my opinion, as many others did.", "When I was a kid, my anxiety surrounding school always manifested as stomach aches. Now as an adult, I can identify if a stomach ache is \"real\" or anxiety because they actually feel different. (I say \"real\" because this pain is legitimate and it's being caused by something, I'm not making it up.) As a kid it was just \"my stomach hurts\" because I didn't know what anxiety was!\n\nUnfortunately, my anxiety didn't get better even with therapy and medication and my high school years were ROUGH, but if OP can identify the problem now they have a chance of making her school years a lot better.", "I call anxiety stomach aches gut rot because they feel like coffee stomach aches which I also call gut rot LOL", "NTA, though my parents had to give up this rule once teachers started kicking me out of class because of a medical condition.", "Why didn't you take her to school when she wasn't \"sick\" anymore? You said it was just an hour after school started. I would have said great! get dressed and get in the car.", "Couldnt you have sent her to school late? Alot of schools have a rule in place that if you're not present in school, you cannot attend any extra curricular activities after school that day.", "NAH handled it perfectly. but you might want to see why she's faking sick to ditch school so often you've seen a pattern. My 9th grade teacher was so bad i did that and so did many other kids just in that class- the chronic issues showed she was no good as a teacher.", "NAH.\n\nThis is a sign of pediatric anxiety. She needs to be evaluated by a psychiatrist.", "Why didn't you just take her in an hour late?!!", "Info: why didn\u2019t you take her to school when she felt better?

Look for bullying, learning difficulties, anxiety issues, or something at home she would prefer, like a video game or book she'd prefer to be engaged with instead of school.

My parents had these rules. I still played sick all the time. Staying in bed and reading, even at like 10 years old, was much less a burden then dealing with school. My advice is to seek therapy for their child. I refused to talk to therapists when I was younger. If talk therapy doesn\u2019t work, try a psychologist\u2026a lot of autistic people don\u2019t find talk therapy helpful.", "In Canada we had buckleys.

This was solely about finding out if there\u2019s a legitimate reason for her to want to miss school or if she just wants to skip out on work.

She may be bullied at school or has some anxiety for some reason.  It would be worth inquiring more to find the cause.", "NTA. I think making her do school work is a great alternative. And going forward, you should tell her the school is going to have to send her home if she\u2019s THAT sick (if you think she\u2019s faking, of course).", "NAH , but when I was a child I had horrible anxiety which was eventually caught as a teen and being a child, I didn't know what it was. I had a difficult home life and was being bullied at school, and I would say I felt sick because I did, but didn't know that the sick feeling was anxiety. Please look into the cause of this behaviour deeper.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nBut- there may be a reason why she\u2019s avoiding school and feigning illness. \n\nMy sister did this- turned out her teacher was bullying her because of my sister\u2019s learning disability.

Why wouldn\u2019t you want that moment with your daughter ? I think if she ends up not being able to go you\u2019ll regret putting this punishment in place someday. Someday she\u2019ll be a teenager who can\u2019t imagine the thought of going to a dance with her dad. Choose your battles", "You're NTA. That is one of the most basic rules of parenting.

When I was too sick for school, it was always either a bullying problem from other kids (Gen X so, \"ignore them\" was all we ever got) or a problem with a teacher I did not like.  You need to find out why so you can help with the real problem.", "This. Is the child not liking school? Dealing with bullies? Struggling with anxiety? If the parents can't figure out what's going on, this kid should be in therapy.\n\nAfter that, I thought most parents have a rule... no fever, no puke? School. I wouldn't just let her stay home whenever and then have her miss out on experiences, because ultimately she's still missing school.", "> No TV or tech it's not good for your eyes... you can read a book\n\nI will say I always hated this argument. Reading a book requires way more mental concentration and physical concentration to move my eyes from one sentence/page to another.

I started showing symptoms of Crohn's disease in elementary school but because I *was* anxious *and* I was being bullied, it was diagnosed as anxiety and my parents were discouraged from getting GI tests done. It took over 20 years, excruciating pain, and several major surgeries before I was finally diagnosed and could begin treatment. \n\nIt's unusual, but if it's financially feasible it's good to rule out big health issues as a contributing factor.", "After my parent\u2019s divorced, I would always feel sick the day after my dad\u2019s weekend.
