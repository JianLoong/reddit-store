{"id": 29724, "submission_id": "17h3s7h", "title": "WIBTA If I hire a nanny to help with childcare after my wife got a new job", "selftext": "My wife (36F) and I (38M) have been married for 12 years and have 3 kids (9, 6, & 4).  We both work full-time with me being the primary breadwinner and earning about 3X what she does.  About 4 months ago, she was offered a promotion at her job.  It wasn't a big step up in pay but would be a lot more responsibility as well as being on-call 3-4 nights a week.\n\nWhen she told me about it, she was really excited and acting like it was a huge opportunity to advance her career.  I was happy for her, but I told her I had some concerns about how often she would be out of the house in the evenings and/or how we would have to alter our schedules and routines due to her being on-call.  She assured me that being on-call wasn't an issue and reiterated that she would be compensated for that time even if she wasn't actually called in.  I told her that ultimately it was her decision, but I feel like we live comfortably already and the little extra money wouldn't be worth the hassle it would cause in our lives.\n\nShe ended up taking the job and wouldn't you know it, she ended up being called in about 50% of the time.  This resulted in us having to find alternate rides for our kids to do activities, cancelling plans, her leaving in the middle of dinner or family time, etc.  I also had to pick up a lot of slack in terms of household duties and childcare.  We have never fought as much as we have been since she took this promotion but she's convinced it's a steppingstone to something better.\n\nI floated the idea of hiring a nanny for the nights she's on-call so that I have help in the inevitable situation where she gets called in again.  Simply having another person to watch the kids if I need to take one of them to an activity or play date, or to be able to make dinner easier or get other chores done.  She shot the idea down immediately and told me that me picking up her slack is not that big of a deal and I should be able to handle it.\n\nAfter a 3 week stretch of her being called in 3 nights a week, I told her that I was going to start looking into nannies with or without her agreement.  I told her the only way I would reconsider is if she tries to get her old job back or look for a different one because her promotion is not working for me or the kids.\n\nShe did not take this well.  She accused me of being a lazy parent and trying to buy my way out of being a father.  She also said that the cost of a nanny would offset any extra money her promotion is bringing in.  When I told her it would actually cost more than that, she got extra pissed.\n\nShe has no timeframe for how long she will be in this position at work and apparently has no care for my feelings on this.  I'm tempted to just hire a nanny anyway because this is not sustainable for me.  I think this promotion has blinded her to how negatively it has impacted the rest of the family and I refuse to just \"suck it up\" any longer.\n\nEDIT: Because so many people seem to be operating under the false assumption that my wife did 100% of the childcare and chores before her promotion, I feel the need to clarify.  Before her promotion, we would divide and conquer and split childcare and chores as evenly as possible.  Both of us were 100% comfortable with how we had these things divided between us.  It's not like I was coming home, demanding to know what was for dinner, cracking a beer, and sitting on the couch until I passed out.

So holding it over her head that her salary increase won't pay for a nanny is a really nasty detail to drive home with her.

Parents with multiple kids do this type of juggling solo all the time. I\u2019d also consider how it could be to find someone to work what sounds like limited hours on an inconsistent schedule.

This is like a 40% work load boost for one parent. Why are people acting like he's being ridiculous?", "I was a single mom and worked full time.  I would have done some very low things to get a full time nanny to help out.  Ride shares aren't always possible, depending on the neighborhood and your socialization.  You must know and live near a lot of people on the same teams?  Great, but I never did.  I did have to hire a nanny just for cheer leading though as there was no way I could assist with that.", "Sounds like you\u2019re projecting pretty hard onto this situation. At no point does he say hiring the nanny would put a strain on them financially. He says he makes 3x as much as she does. From the original post it seems like affording a nanny is a non issue outside of the wife not liking that it\u2019ll cost more than her raise was. \n\nYou know not every man out there us completely incompetent right?\n\nI could easily do the same thing you did and jump to conclusions assuming she\u2019s upset because she\u2019s projecting her guilt over not being able to participate at home as much onto the situation. If he picks up all the slack then it\u2019s status quo as usual. If he hires a nanny then she actually has to acknowledge the impact of not being around as much. \n\nBased on the content of the op it seems she didn\u2019t take the promotion for the money but for the fulfilment. So money wasn\u2019t the issue. She didn\u2019t take the increased responsibility because they desperately needed more. She told him herself she wouldn\u2019t be making much more. So what\u2019s the issue? From what he says and has commented they seem to be fairly well off. If they can afford more help for the kids why exactly is that a problem? Seems like a weird stance to take that someone should be shamed for wanting their children to have as much attention as possible.", "But if you could would you have hired a nanny?  I know I would.  \n\nI think OP is drowning.  He\u2019s found a solution for it, and the fact that his wife is refusing is not right.  \n\nThere are families with 10 kids that the parents run it well, then there\u2019s one with two kids and the parents are overwhelmed.  Not everyone is a super parent and acknowledging that and get help is the best way to go, having a spouse that refuses to allow you to get the help you need is not the right thing in a marriage.  Also he\u2019s not saying hire a nanny and then he leaves he want to hire them to be there to help him with the kids.", "That's a lot of work you are throwing on other parents if you are making them take your kid two to three days a week because you have to take another child to their sporting activity as that's what you think he should do.  At those ages they most likely have to assist with dress out since this is hockey and that's a lot of time to expect another parent to be helping your kid as well as their own on top of taking them back and forth.  This isn't a one off where it happens infrequently it's seems it's become a regular occurrence for the wife is gone 3 nights a week.  If you have no other choice to burden other parents then that may be the route you have to take but in this instance he can afford a nanny to share in getting his kids to the activities they need to get to without continually asking others to do it and since it's an on-call situation he would be asking these other parents at the last minute to take over these duties which is also unfair.", ">I wonder how much of the doctor/dentist/sick kid stuff the dad takes care of?

My two kids had activities that we at different times of the yr. fortunately. I was also fortunate to have a husband who completely understood.

They used to tag team this stuff and now they\u2019re not, it\u2019s completely understandable to want to have someone to help with this stuff.", "How can they 'arrange regular ride shares' when she's on call and doesn't know when she's going to be called in? It sounds like it's not just the workload that's the problem, it's that her schedule isn't predictable. \n\nOn top of that, I don't see why he needs to do even more (while earning 3x what she does) 'just because'.

It was just expected of them.", "Literally done it. For years. I mean cripes if he has to hire someone a mother\u2019s helper maybe?

Just because other families have struggled through getting the kids to sports and the other kids staying up late to do that, doesn't mean everybody should if they don't have to.\n\nBut secondly, if he hadn't been speaking so dismissively about her career and this promotion, and if he would be more supportive of her getting ahead and not treat her career as less than his, maybe she would be more open to this. If he's this dismissive of her career on a post where he's trying to get a favourable outcome, how has he been to her face about it? I'm assuming she's trying to get back some of the time in her career she took off to have kids - OP doesn't say how much time she took off for each child, but it has to be some time, or at absolute least, there were 3 periods of her life where she couldn't go the extra mile at work.

Unfortunately a lot of jobs will offer \"promotions\" that basically have people working a disproportionate amount of time more, have more responsibility, and barely get a raise.

No one would be questioning how much OP was contributing if they were the wife, and OP answered in the comments that its 50-50.\n\nThis isn't a case of op not Able to take care of kid's by himself, but taking care of them, and getting them to practice, and dinner and everything. Parents, Moms and dads will struggle with it, and it's wrong for a partner to say \"suck it up\" regardless of gender.\n\n> But I will push back on the \"isn't worth the trade-off\" - this has been the narrative basically since women went back to work instead of staying home to do all the child care and household tasks, and saying it isn't worth the trade-off is saying OP's wife's future career just isn't worth the trade-off of a stage in their lives where they're a bit busier than they were before she took this role.\n\nThis happens time and time again, and it's causing women to earn a lot less money overall - part of the reason they're earning a lot less is that they took time off to have babies, but a huge part is that once they go back to work, they're not supported at home to work extra hours to try and make up for that time, and they're expected to put their career on hold until their kids are grown. In this story, OP's wife is expected to just continue to work in her job that pays significantly less than her husband, and she can't take a higher role (that will probably be a stepping stone to other, better roles) without OP being pretty dismissive about her career, and insisting they need a nanny 3 nights a week.\n\nThis again, isn't what me or OP is saying and is irrelevant. This isn't a gender thing, it's a company taking advantage of their employees issue. I fell into this trap that OPs wife is currently in.

She probably would be fine with getting a sitter if she thought it was meant to support her career ambitions.

Maybe when the kids are older and can drive themselves or be more autonomous, but sacrifices in all aspects of your life are what happen when you have kids. Both for fathers and mothers alike.   \n\nThis isn\u2019t an issue about women earning less in the workplace and her never getting the next step again and having to struggle now to succeed later because of potentially diminished opportunities.

I\u2019ve never heard of parents leaving their 6 year olds at a practice. Seems irresponsible.", "\"Not as bad\" still doesn't make it good.

There are plenty of ways to entertain kids these days so he won\u2019t be bored. \n\nI think the reason your wife is so resistant to the idea of a nanny is because it seems like there\u2019s a way to manage things without having to hire a child care provider. I don\u2019t think it makes financial sense to pay someone three days a week when there\u2019s a 50% chance they won\u2019t be needed on those days.

But none of us are at OP's wife's job, and it's undeniable that not being able to take promotions that require extra work can and has impacted promotions in the past. \n\nAnd this isn't really regardless of gender - men's wages don't take a hit when they have kids, and many studies have said that men on average earn more if they have kids, but women's wages definitely take a hit when they have kids, and this carries over even if they take very minimal time off to actually birth these children. Just the expectation that they won't take on the extra work that is often needed to work your way up the ladder at work means that they're not offered those roles, and they're stuck in a role that makes a third of what their husband makes with no room to move up. \n\nMaybe this role won't lead to further promotions, but we can't say that, and until OP's wife is stuck in this role without moving up for a decent amount of time, I think OP being like \"It's not worth the hassle\" is dismissing her career, and how just stagnating in her career for the next decade so she can drive her kids to hockey is going to impact her future.", ">but I feel like we live comfortably already and the little extra money wouldn't be worth the hassle it would cause in our lives.\n\nThat was OP's words about what he said when she first presented the promotion opportunity to him. He's put the value of the promotion down to only the little extra money she's making, and not the possibility that she can go further in her career. I don't see how this isn't him being dismissive. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think she's being dismissive of his question of hiring a nanny for those nights. I think it could help them both be more present parents, and this is probably an ESH situation, but maybe if he hadn't dismissed this opportunity based on what monetary value it would bring in this moment initially, she would be more open to his suggestions now. \n\nOP's wife having three kids over a 5 year period has definitely impacted her career, and asking her to continue to put her career on hold for at least the next decade will mean there's no chance she can ever earn anything close to what her husband earns, which means her career will always be seen as less than.

This requires you to drop off the children and your 4 year old be in the car with you. You do not seem to want the 4 year old out to late. What did you do before when your wife wasn't working this job- was one person at home with the 4 year old while the other dropped the boys off? Did the 4 year old ride along with one of the parents?  You are concerned about the 4 year not getting enough sleep for the next day but your other children have to go to school the next day as well. How long are these practices and can't they be held on weekends?\n\nHow many chores must be done on practice days? Why do you need to make dinner from scratch on practice days- could you not simple reheat some leftovers? It seems to me that you just need a driver and/or babysitter on the days that your wife is on call. And if you more or less split childcare and chores evenly, why is there such a strain now? Could it be that in reality, your wife did more of the house work than you are willing to admit? And the children are certainly old enough to be doing basic chores.\n\nAnd by the way, you seem awfully dismissive about her job.
