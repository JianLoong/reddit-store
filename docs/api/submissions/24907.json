I'm American, from the San Francisco Bay Area, California. She's British, from a small town in West Yorkshire. We've been together for about a year. I've stayed with her in her hometown a couple of times. She's currently staying with me and my parents.\n\nLucy hates her hometown and likes to get out as much as possible. She's been on several hitchhiking trips across Europe. This is her first time in the US. I'm not sure what hitchhiking in Europe is like (I haven't been anywhere in Europe aside from the UK), but my mom always told me to never pick up hitchhikers as you don't know if they genuinely need a ride or if they want to get into your car so they can attack you.\n\nSo today, Lucy and I were driving through a not-so-nice area in the city where I live. We were stopped at a red light. There was a guy with his thumb up to signal that he was trying to get a ride. He looked to be maybe in his 30s and was clearly homeless. He also looked like he was high as a kite. He walked up to our car and knocked on the window. I ignored him. Lucy suggested we pick him up and take him wherever he needed to go. I said no. She asked why, and I told her what my mom said about picking up hitchhikers. Lucy said that there isn't anything wrong with hitchhiking, and reminded me of her trips across Europe. I told her that maybe it's different in Europe, but where I live, most people who hitchhike are untrustworthy.\n\nThe light turned green and we drove away. In my rear view mirror I could see the guy flipping us off. I pointed it out to her, but she said that he's probably frustrated because he can't go anywhere. I told her that there's no way I'm giving any stranger a ride. It's not like I'm an Uber driver. She asked me if I was afraid of him. Honestly I kinda was. I reminded Lucy, again, about what my mom told me. She said that she could understand why my mom might be hesitant to pick up a hitchhiker, but it's different because I'm a guy, so he probably wouldn't try to mess with us, and in the off chance he tried anything, I'd be able to defend the both of us. I told her that I stand by my decision to not take him (by that point we were far away from where he was so it wouldn't make sense for us to turn back and pick him up). Lucy remained quiet for the remainder of the drive.\n\nWe got back to the house. Lucy was tired and went to lie down. I told my mom about everything that just happened. She told me that did the right thing by not giving him a ride. I feel bad though. Not because I didn't give him a ride, but because Lucy was upset with me. So I'm not sure if I made the right decision. She has expressed her desire to go on a hitchhiking trip across the US at some point, and honestly I'm not sure how comfortable I am with doing that.\n\nAITA for refusing to give a hitchhiker a ride, and upsetting my girlfriend?", "created_utc": 1692318990, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15u521o/aita_for_refusing_to_give_a_hitchhiker_a_ride/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have no idea who you\u2019re dealing with. I also find it ludicrous that she assumes you could defend the both of you if things went south; this is not to knock your fighting ability, but she thinks it\u2019s ok to make a risky decision and then expect you to assume the physical risk.", "NTA. She sounds kinda delusional. It\u2019s also dangerous for hitchhikers because the people picking you up could be bad guys also. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s different in the UK because there aren\u2019t as many guns but they still have knife attacks.", "NTA - Hitchhiking is dangerous for all parties. A driver picking up a hitchhiker is at risk of harm from the hitchhiker and the hitchhiker is at risk of harm from the driver. Assuming that he won't mess with you because you are a man is extremely shortsighted. This is America after all, you never know who has a damn gun.", "NTA. Seriously, Lucy needs a reality check. You did the responsible thing by not picking up a sketchy-looking, high-as-a-kite stranger. It's mind-boggling that she's comparing hitchhiking in Europe to a situation in a not-so-safe area where you felt uncomfortable. Her assumption that being a guy automatically means no risk is naive at best. Safety isn't a gender-exclusive concept, and her insistence that you should've picked up a potentially dangerous individual is just reckless. You had every right to prioritize your safety and not cave in to her misguided ideals. It's time for Lucy to rethink her \"adventurous\" notions and realize that real life isn't as simple as her European escapades. You're NTA, and her disappointment should be a reality check for her own judgment.", "The guy was high; he already posed a risk to y'all's safety. Lucy may have been one of the few hitchhikers out there who were harmless and were lucky enough to not get kidnapped or taken advantage of. I have watched too much true crime to trust hitchhikers lol. NTA", "NTA.  Unfortunately it's at a point you can't trust any stranger in the US.", "NTA, NTA, NTA. A thousand, thousand times NTA. So what if you're a guy? Last time I checked being male doesn't make you bulletproof or render you immune to being stabbed by some strung-out homeless dude. That bit about \"it's different because you're a guy\" and \"you'd be able to defend us both\" is so much ignorant, sexist B.S. Your girlfriend needs a reality check.", "NTA\n\nLucy sounds pretty foolhardy to me and I think you may need to prepare yourself for her trying to drag you into more potentially dangerous situations if you stay with her.\n\nDon't ever be talked into something you're not comfortable with.", "NTA. Hitchhiking was a common tactic a few serial killers used to find victims. Being a hitchhiker or picking one up is not safe in the US. You don\u2019t know who has a gun, who would try to traffic you, or what said person would do. Given the technology we have today there is very little reason to do so. \n\nLucy fails to realize that in Europe it\u2019s far more common for people to walk from place to place than it is here. I\u2019d imagine hitchhiking in certain areas there would be safer due to more weapon restrictions combined with it being generally more common. It is not common here and you\u2019re playing 50/50 on what could happen to you. Someone else can take that chance.", "NTA Don't ever give a ride to a hitchhiker. You may be a guy but how would you deal with a gun or knife? Imagine picking up a guy, he sits at the back and draws a gun. Also I wouldn't go on a hitchhiking trip in the US or anywhere else. There are sociopaths and predators out there.", "NTA I'm British, have lived in the US for years.  I would never pick up a hitchhiker.  I also would not hitchhike.  My mom did, across Europe, but with her two brothers.  \n\nDoes she know most criminals here have guns, unlike Europe?  It's much easier to rob or kill with a gun.", "NTA I would never pick up a hitchhiker because this guy Ivan Milat was literally known as the back packer killer.\n[the inspiration for the movie wolf creek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Milat)", "NTA.

If you don't want to pick up a hitchhiker, don't. It's that simple. If she wants to in her own vehicle by herself, that's her choice. But not with you. \n\nMy partner and I (both women) do not pick up hitchhikers. My partner's mom always picks them up. It's scary AF for us but she just doesn't want to stop.

I'm going to tell mommy now. Sure she'll comfort me\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedited to add : I'm not saying not picking up the guy is the AH move.

I have exactly three experiences hitchhiking. \n\nI live in South Florida, USA. When I was about 23, I was driving home from my girlfriend's house on Christmas Eve and I saw a guy maybe 30 walking on the shoulder of the on ramp to a major highway. I offered him a ride thinking he had a disabled car on the highway and he seemed afraid of the proposition. He declined and I wished him merry Christmas and was ready to drive off but he reconsidered and got in. He was definitely off, probably on some kind of drugs and was barely able to communicate. He had a nervous anxiety and It was clear he wasn't going back to a disabled vehicle and asked me to drop him off at a friend's house which was way too far away and I ended up doing him off somewhere closer, I forget exactly where.\n\nWhen I was 18 I flew out to rural Pennsylvania way out in the mountains and was trying to find my way back to the airport, the taxi that I took from the airport to this small town was expensive and apparently a one way trip. So I started walking (at night because I was dumb), this was back in my goth phase and I had a black trenchcoat and I was a city boy that had never experienced country dark before, and there were definitely animals in the long patches of country roads. I was desperate for a ride and tried to thumbs up anyone that came but noone stopped and I don't blame them.\n\nThe third was also when I was extremely young and naive. I was talking to a girl online who lived in...I forget where, one of the neighboring states of new York. I made plans to fly out and see her and her family abruptly moved to upstate new York between the time I booked the tickets and actually took the flight. I landed at some little airport where we literally got off the plane by stairs on the tarmac instead of into any sort of airport and when I eventually got to the main facility I went out front and there were only like three cars. I stopped one of the middle aged ladies dropping off a relative and asked where the nearest town was. This place was in the middle of the woods. She was sympathetic and gave me a ride into the city and taught me how to get the Greyhound to where I needed to go.\n\nSo I've given a ride to a creepy stranger. I've desperately needed a ride and been saved by the kindness of strangers. And I've desperately needed a ride and been up shits creek.\n\nI don't blame you for not giving a ride to a tweaker in the middle of the road. There's a right way and a wrong way to hail rides. Anyone with a real need will hang out at a well lit gas station/rest stop and make an effort to plead their case and allow you to see their vibe before you make a decision.", "NTA. I'm from the original family in SF (J Briones) and have known for decades you don't pick up hitchhikers in our area. Please tell her that there are too many real stories that ended badly.
