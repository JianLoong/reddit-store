They sleep in the masters, they have a bedroom for the girls, a bedroom for the boys, and a guest bedroom.   \n\n\nthe sleeping arrangements for this trip was my daughters and niece in one bedroom, my son and nephews in another, my wife, our baby, and I in the spare bedroom, and my BIL and SIL on a pull out couch in the den.   \n\n\nFor a week leading up to the trip, my son was complaining about having to share a room with his cousins because they\u2019d ask to play with him, he can\u2019t watch whatever he wants on the tv, and he\u2019d have to be quiet after their bedtime. My wife and I told him it one week and he\u2019ll survive and reminded him that his sisters are sharing a room with their 3 year old sister and 8 year old cousin and aren\u2019t complaining.   \n\n\nHe still insisted that it wasn\u2019t fair and accused him of trying to ruin his vacation just because he got in trouble at school recently. We told him that him getting in trouble has nothing to do with the sleeping arrangements. There\u2019s just no way he\u2019d get a room to himself for this trip. My wife told him if the sleeping arrangements bother him that much, there\u2019s an open couch in the family room but he was refusing that too.   \n\n\nOn the first night of the trip, he waited until my BIL and SIL went to bed then woke his cousins up and told them that they can go camping in the family room. They took their sleeping bags and slept on the family room floor. My wife and I took his phone and tablet for the week after he pulled that stunt and told him that if he did it again, he\u2019d be sleeping on the floor of our room.   \n\n\nHis complaining just got worse after that and his attitude was starting to ruin the trip for everybody. It was so bad that we considered sending him home to stay with my parents. My son told his mom (my ex) that we made him share a room with his cousins on the trip and she agreed that it was unfair to make him share a room with them for a week because \u201c15 year old boys need privacy\u201c. Before anyone asks why he couldn\u2019t stay with his mom, she lives in a different state and we\u2019re not comfortable with him flying alone, plus he hasn\u2019t seen this side of the family in a couple years.   \n\n\nAita for making him share the room?", "created_utc": 1675893910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xcbn3/aita_for_making_my_15_year_old_son_share_a_room/", "score": 557, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Although did she actually agree, or did your son just tell you that he talked to her and she told him she agreed?)\n\nAnyway, chalk the whole thing up to teenage mood swings. Teenagers often don't enjoy big family vacations in close quarters; all of their energy is dedicated to establishing themselves as an individual, and this sort of thing literally cramps their style.

Not many teenagers want to be around a bunch of kids.", "NTA although i do understand his frustration. Not sure i fully agree with the punishment though but you do you its not my kid", "NTA, that's just part of visiting family.  It wasn't permanent, it was for a few days.

My family, my aunt's family, and my grandma all going to my other aunt's in another state.  It was a big family campout in all the rooms basically.  Big meals, a few nearby trips, it was fantastic.  I'm sorry he doesn't feel that same sort of way.  I get the being bored thing after they go to sleep, but headphones and a tablet would have taken care of that.", "NTA. \n\nFor one week in a house with limited space.  I mean, he could find a mattress and sleep in the hallway. \n\n I get it though.  It's not always easy to beat off in the shower if there are many other people there needing the bathroom.\nAt 15 he shouldn't have issues flying around the country though.", "INFO - Did he want to tag along under those conditions?

Yeah, need to have consequences but that was ott - and basically useless as punishments that are that long are generally pointless in reinforcing message. Also it's not linked logically.\n\nMaking him sleep on your floor, not just threatening it, would have been a good call! You don't like that room - fine, have this floor!\n\nBut yeah, you are basically camping out and he needs to deal.\n\nWould having the younger boys' parents sleeping in the bedroom and he gets the pull-out work?

You two were the only guests who got a good deal. All the kids and BIL/SIL either had to share a room or sleep on a pull out. So rough choice for a vacation.

I had a talk with my kid at 10 years old. I said that life is not fair. It never has been, it never will be. Then I gave him examples of the unfairness of life. You need to have a discussion like this with all your kids. I also suggest that for any future trips you pack a paperback book with you. If you ever find yourself needing to take away electronics, then you have a backup activity.", "NTA.", "NTA. He is being a brat. The joys of teenagers!", "NTA But being forced to go on a vacation where you have a bed time and can't watch anything that isn't PG would feel like torture to most teens. Especially after you took his phone.", "NTA", "Going against the grain and saying YTA. People are joking that the teen wanted privacy to masturbate. First that\u2019s gross that your mind went there. Second, maybe he is just introverted. Maybe he needs privacy for self care. \n\nOr, hear me out, he is a person and deserves autonomy when he asks for it. No reason necessary. \n\nAs someone who introverted the idea of spending a week in a four bedroom house with 14 people is overwhelming. I would rather have a root canal.  \n\nHaving him suck it up for a couple of nights is one thing. A week? I would have told you to fuck off and stayed home.", "NTA. He ought to be grateful to go on vacation. If he needs privacy, he is welcome to kick in enough money so that everybody can get an Airbnb. Since, he isn't paying for it, he shouldn't be complaining about it.", "NAH. You're trying to cram a lot of people in a small space and you're teenager is acting like a teenager.", "As an introvert, this many people packed into a house for an entire week sounds like my idea of hell. Honestly, I would very likely have a nervous breakdown in that type of sardine living arrangement for that long of a time. I mean, he's sharing a bedroom with four people.\n\nIs your kid an introvert? Does he need alone time to recharge? Did he have a place he could go to be alone in the house? Did you help him figure out coping skills to get through the week when his energy reserves were taxed to the limit?\n\nNo, you just said \"Deal with it,\" and then punished him for getting creative.\n\nI'm not going to say that your actions went into AH territory, but I do think that you may be suffering the extrovert's sin of assuming that your child's social and psychological needs are the same as yours, and failing to help him figure out how to survive as an introvert in a prolonged social situation.\n\n~~NAH, just a lot of people not listening to each other~~.\n\nedit: I'm changing my verdict to YTA. The way OP is running around high fiving anybody who calls their kid names is pretty wrong.", "NTA \n\nThose are very reasonable sleeping arrangements. It was for a week, not his whole life. Your son is a brat and he learned the hard way that actions have consequences. The punishment was not extreme.\n\nHe could have relocated to the family room. He just want to have his own way.", "NTA. At all. You son, on the other hand\u2026.   Time for someone to wake precious prince up, and it obviously will not be his mother. Good luck sir, teens can be hell!", "[deleted]", "I think the 16f deserved the \u2018privacy\u2019 more than he did, if he\u2019s gonna use that excuse, or your ex. \nNTA.

In his grandparents bedroom?\n\nNo joking now. Where did he think he would get his \"privicy\"?", "YTA why the fuck did you have so many kids? Wear a condom, make your wife get on the pill, do something!", "I have a feeling that your son will remember this as the \u201cvacation from hell\u201d and will do whatever it takes not to repeat it.", "NTA. I immediately noticed that your teenage and tween daughter were rooming with a kid about the same age as the younger boys, plus a TODDLER and didn\u2019t complain. It is annoying not to have all the space in the world you want? Sure. Can he deal with rooming with his younger cousins for a week? Absolutely. \n\nAnd especially kicking the little out into the common area in the middle of the night? He could have gone out to sleep on the couch and that probably would have been an actual solution, but instead he tried to claim the entire bedroom when no one else had one to themselves. Just selfish teenage antics all around.", "YTA. I can\u2019t sleep with other people in the room and always made it everyone\u2019s business until they fixed it so I hope he does the same thing", "NTA.  Space was limited.  Everybody had to make do.  He's being quite the AH though.  Teenagers can be very...challenging.", "Question: Were you making your son go to bed at the same time as his young cousins? If so, I could understand his indignation. Also, for your own piece of mind, I wouldn't have taken away his laptop. If that distracted him from complaining, I would have let him have that and come up with another punishment-- making him sleep where he sent the kids for example.", "Why would you ever have that many kids and why would you ever think that many people could be comfortable in a 4 bedroom house?", "NTA and while some may call it \"being a teenager\", I call it unacceptable and worthy of appropriate consequences.  It was a single week, not a 20 year jail sentence for pity's sake.  That is selfish, bratty behavior.", "ESH - I get family trips, but packing a bunch of kids in a wide age range into 2 rooms sounds fucking awful. You don\u2019t seem to even consider that your son and daughter are different people with different tolerances for kids.\n\nHe\u2019s being a whiny asshole for sure, but you also give so few shits about his feelings that you completely disregard them.", "NTA. In my experience, children sharing by gender is the norm when extended family has to share limited accommodation space.", "He doesn't need his own room, but that is an unreasonable amount of people to have in four bedrooms for a week. If these trips are common, other arrangements really should be figured out. I'm going with YTA  largely because you were shutting your teenage son down instead of communicating and at least considering his concerns.", "Of course you're not. NTA\n\nThe fact he also refused the couch proves he's merely selfish.", "NTA. And way to go holding the line. \n\nYou offered him a VERY acceptable option - the couch. He didn't want it. That's on him.", "NTA - I don't see anything wrong with what you did. Whilst it may not have been ideal for him it was certainly fair for everyone. Not sure why a 15 y/o should have got a room to himself in those circumstances.", "YTA not a major one just a dumb one. That sounds like a terrible \u201cvacation\u201d for a 15 year old. You should\u2019ve known better. He is 15 bro. He can fly alone and will be just fine. Let him see his mom or hang out with friends while your gone. No 15 year old wants to go on a vacation and share a room with young kids. \n\nYour threat of sending him home almost sounds like a good deal.", "NTA.\n\nI expect a lot of people who grew up spoiled to respond with YTA comments. It is a 1 week trip. The arrangements are not ideal but he should be old enough by now to have learned flexibility.\n\nWhat I would say is try not to make a habit of it. At 15, I'd be pretty pissed off if I was looking forward enjoying time off from school and then got yanked on a family vacation I wasn't too keen on. It is harder for him because he doesn't have cousins who are close enough in age for him to bond with.", "NTA\n\nThe 16 yr old girl had to share a room with 3 other girls. The 15 yr old boy had to share a room with 2 other boys. 4 to 3. Nope he had the better numbers. It was a 1 week family vacation.  Unless those 2 other boys were harming him in some manner not mentioned in the post his behavior was atrocious.

We simply don't have the information to assume either way.", "No, the father and step mother are the parents in the nuclear family that this boy lives with. It's not ideal, but he has to make an effort to be a member of both families (his bio mother's and his bio father's), and his bio father's includes his step-mother and her relatives. I think it's equally important that he be civil and flexible when getting along with other's when that's what's called for. Kids who are allowed to always be selfish are a nightmare to deal with.", "Side note, 32 people in one house sounds terrible.", "I try to remember that this is basically r/judgybusybodies and you shouldn't be surprised by some of the reactionary comments.

I never touched a tissue or clothing in their rooms without rubber gloves on once they hit puberty.  lol", "Could have just started it at nine.  The major point is......he was given the only two choices there were and instead he chose to be a brat.  I have 12 kids, 2 in heaven we went on vacations, vacation homes do not usually have a room for every child", "NAH, but at 15 you also know what you don\u2019t want. He clearly didn\u2019t want this so his complaints are justifiable. He didn\u2019t want to be there and now is sleeping with 2 kids who haven\u2019t even reached double digits. They go to bed at 8pm and he then has to tiptoe around a room instead. I would\u2019ve complained too because:\n\n1. I don\u2019t want to be there. At 15 I am old enough to express myself and old enough to feel disregarded when my opinion or feelings get absolutely stepped on. \n\n2. The house is cramped. Maybe he might not have this same feeling, but a cramped house is not exactly the most comfortable. I love my family, but when there\u2019s too many people I feel overwhelmed. It quickly turns from a happy vacation to wanting to get out of there as soon as possible. \n\n3. Sleeping in a room with multiple people sucks. It\u2019s even worse when the other people go to sleep super early and are little kids. \n\n4. Sleeping on a couch is super uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t even want to be there in the first place. I definitely do not want to sleep on a couch and I most definitely don\u2019t want to be there. \n\n5. They aren\u2019t his biological grandparents. They are his stepmom\u2019s parents. How he feels about them is entirely up to him. My step fathers parents ARE NOT my grandparents. That\u2019s just because of what I\u2019ve decided and could be completely different for him. \n\nSo honestly, I can\u2019t blame him for complaining. Just because his sister didn\u2019t complain doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t. They could\u2019ve left him with his grandparents. He was completely wrong for tricking his cousins. For a situation the situation his reaction makes a lot of sense. I don\u2019t think anyone is wrong here.", "It's not his family though. He has grandparents. His dad's parents and his mom's parents. These are his step-mom's parents. It's understandable he doesn't have much of a relationship with them when they only came into his life recently and live far away.", "How about you learn to read?\n\nThey are not his family.\n\nThey are the family of his step mother.

Or that she complained to OP his wife.", "Nah. Disagree. But thanks for weighing in in such a validating way!", "Stop calling them his cousins and his grandparents. They are his stepmother's family, and the way you keep referring to them like they are not only related because of marriage makes you come across as one of those \"we are going to have a happy blended family and damn the feelings of the kids\" which makes you sound like a major AH of a father.", "This doesn\u2019t sounds like a fun vacation for your son frankly. \nNot saying his behaviour is warranted, but I can see why it\u2019s not enjoyable.", "They\u2019re not his grandparents. They are his step mothers parents. Since you have a 3 year old and a baby I\u2019m gonna assume that you\u2019ve been with your current wife for like 4 or 5 years. Some old people that your son met when he was 10 or 11 because they\u2019re related to your partner doesn\u2019t make them his grandparents and based on his behavior he might not see them that way", "Those aren\u2019t his grandparents, they are his stepmom\u2019s parents. He may not like being there at all. Not saying he shouldn\u2019t be able to stay in a room with kids for a week but as he gets older you have to understand that hanging out with his stepmom\u2019s family may not be a nice vacation for you. Not sure why you feel like you can\u2019t trust him to fly to see HIS mother since kids that age and younger do it all the time but you might think about how to handle this in the future.", "He had a couch to sleep on. I'm assuming he could use the couch to sleep on after everyone else went to bed, so if he chose that, he'd be limited still. The core issue here is the kid was complaining about not ever having time alone. He complained about how he was always being trailed by the two younger kids and bothered by them when they were awake, and when they were asleep, he couldn't make noise or he'd wake them, so he really had no privacy. You can't watch certain TV shows when a kid could wake up, or if you do then you can't laugh or gasp or make other noise that could wake them (some people wake VERY EASILY). \n\nOP is NTA for the sleeping arrangements, but he dropped the ball on a lot of other things.", "Some people are more family oriented, some people are less. Maybe the daughter really enjoys, maybe she dislikes but doesn't have the courage to express herself.", "Maybe the daughter doesn't like this arrangement, but she doesn't have the courage to express herself.\n\nI's a really sad situation as a teenager to get dragged in places you don't want to be.", "Info needed: are the girls your wife\u2019s bio kids?", "No, I just have a brain.", "Every kid is different. You seem pressed and making allot of assumptions. Have nice evening.", "Especially when he was just recently in trouble for something.", "I'm pretty sure staying with a friend does not require air travel.", "But OP did say he was thinking of sending him to stay with his parents, so I guess that could have been an option from the start? If the 15yo was complaining so loudly about this before the trip even happened, maybe this could have been presented as an option from the get go.\n\nI do think they dealt with this as best as possible, and OP is NTA. He's 15, so being a spoilt brat is par for the course, but he'll have to learn that sometimes you don't get your own private room on every single trip, especially when nobody else does as well. There were 4 girls in the girl's room, aged from 3-16, what did OP's son think was going to happen?", "Didn\u2019t catch that, thanks.", "But its not about when hes awake? Its about him sleeping. Which has nothing to do with the kids.\nOn night 1 he went to bed woke them up and sent them to the lounge... he is a little AH.\n\nIts 2 families its not that many in the house and its olny for a week ffs. They clearly fit its just the kid being an entitled prick (not uncommon for 15 yo boys to be fair to him)", "And OP has responded to every single question that puts his kid in a bad light and has refused to answer any direct questions about his marriage timeline and how well his kid knew these people.\n\nWhy do you think that is? I have a guess.", "At age 16, we went to my aunt's for Thanksgiving. She and my mother had been estranged since I was about 5, and it was my first time meeting her in-person since about then, and I'd never met her husband or a number of other relatives--ranging in age from 18ish to 50--on my mom's side who were there during the day. I slept on the couch, my sister on a different couch, and my parents had their own room. I spent the entire three days feeling awkward and unsure because I didn't know how to talk to these adults I'd never met. I locked myself in the bathroom a few times just so I could have a chance to take deep breaths and be alone and calm myself from having to be On all the time.\n\nI would have 5000% preferred being left alone on Thanksgiving than having to deal with that as a teenager. I would prefer being alone on Thanksgiving to dealing with that NOW. Some people Don't Do Well with constant contact and interaction with others, regardless of age. Waking his younger cousins and making them move that first night was a bad move, and there really wasn't a way to change the sleeping arrangements so he could have his own space, but there's a LOT more going on than 'being selfish' or 'teenage angst'. \n\nNAH, but on any future trips, OP should try to schedule some time specifically for his older kids to have Time Alone. Some time to destress and recharge--without anyone looking over your shoulder, asking you questions, or who you have to watch your language/volume/actions for--can make a HUGE difference, even if you have to say 'Look, my kids need one hour to themselves every afternoon, how can we make that work?'", ">No, the father and step mother are the parents in the nuclear family that this boy lives with\n\nNo, his step-mother is not his parent. He actually *has* a mother.\n\nI think calling a 15 year old who is struggling with a blended family model a \"selfish nightmare\" is pretty cold. \n\nYou have so much empathy for the parents in this situation and ZERO for a kid who is clearly going through some stuff.
