My wife and I told him it one week and he\u2019ll survive and reminded him that his sisters are sharing a room with their 3 year old sister and 8 year old cousin and aren\u2019t complaining.   \n\n\nHe still insisted that it wasn\u2019t fair and accused him of trying to ruin his vacation just because he got in trouble at school recently. We told him that him getting in trouble has nothing to do with the sleeping arrangements. There\u2019s just no way he\u2019d get a room to himself for this trip. My wife told him if the sleeping arrangements bother him that much, there\u2019s an open couch in the family room but he was refusing that too.   \n\n\nOn the first night of the trip, he waited until my BIL and SIL went to bed then woke his cousins up and told them that they can go camping in the family room. They took their sleeping bags and slept on the family room floor. My wife and I took his phone and tablet for the week after he pulled that stunt and told him that if he did it again, he\u2019d be sleeping on the floor of our room.   \n\n\nHis complaining just got worse after that and his attitude was starting to ruin the trip for everybody. It was so bad that we considered sending him home to stay with my parents. My son told his mom (my ex) that we made him share a room with his cousins on the trip and she agreed that it was unfair to make him share a room with them for a week because \u201c15 year old boys need privacy\u201c. Before anyone asks why he couldn\u2019t stay with his mom, she lives in a different state and we\u2019re not comfortable with him flying alone, plus he hasn\u2019t seen this side of the family in a couple years.   \n\n\nAita for making him share the room?", "created_utc": 1675893910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xcbn3/aita_for_making_my_15_year_old_son_share_a_room/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Although did she actually agree, or did your son just tell you that he talked to her and she told him she agreed?)\n\nAnyway, chalk the whole thing up to teenage mood swings. Teenagers often don't enjoy big family vacations in close quarters; all of their energy is dedicated to establishing themselves as an individual, and this sort of thing literally cramps their style.

Is he planning on watching porn and masturbating at his grandparents house? NTA.", "NTA.  Man those are some of my best memories as a kid.  My family, my aunt's family, and my grandma all going to my other aunt's in another state.  It was a big family campout in all the rooms basically.  Big meals, a few nearby trips, it was fantastic.  I'm sorry he doesn't feel that same sort of way.  I get the being bored thing after they go to sleep, but headphones and a tablet would have taken care of that.", "NTA. \n\nFor one week in a house with limited space.

Yeah, need to have consequences but that was ott - and basically useless as punishments that are that long are generally pointless in reinforcing message. Also it's not linked logically.\n\nMaking him sleep on your floor, not just threatening it, would have been a good call! You don't like that room - fine, have this floor!\n\nBut yeah, you are basically camping out and he needs to deal.\n\nWould having the younger boys' parents sleeping in the bedroom and he gets the pull-out work?

You two were the only guests who got a good deal. All the kids and BIL/SIL either had to share a room or sleep on a pull out. So rough choice for a vacation.

I had a talk with my kid at 10 years old. I said that life is not fair. It never has been, it never will be. Then I gave him examples of the unfairness of life. You need to have a discussion like this with all your kids. I also suggest that for any future trips you pack a paperback book with you. If you ever find yourself needing to take away electronics, then you have a backup activity.", "NTA.", "NTA. He is being a brat. The joys of teenagers!", "NTA But being forced to go on a vacation where you have a bed time and can't watch anything that isn't PG would feel like torture to most teens. Especially after you took his phone.", "NTA", "Going against the grain and saying YTA. People are joking that the teen wanted privacy to masturbate. First that\u2019s gross that your mind went there. Second, maybe he is just introverted. Maybe he needs privacy for self care. \n\nOr, hear me out, he is a person and deserves autonomy when he asks for it. No reason necessary. \n\nAs someone who introverted the idea of spending a week in a four bedroom house with 14 people is overwhelming. I would rather have a root canal.  \n\nHaving him suck it up for a couple of nights is one thing. A week? I would have told you to fuck off and stayed home.", "NTA. He ought to be grateful to go on vacation. If he needs privacy, he is welcome to kick in enough money so that everybody can get an Airbnb. Since, he isn't paying for it, he shouldn't be complaining about it.", "NAH. You're trying to cram a lot of people in a small space and you're teenager is acting like a teenager.", "As an introvert, this many people packed into a house for an entire week sounds like my idea of hell. Honestly, I would very likely have a nervous breakdown in that type of sardine living arrangement for that long of a time. I mean, he's sharing a bedroom with four people.\n\nIs your kid an introvert? Does he need alone time to recharge? Did he have a place he could go to be alone in the house? Did you help him figure out coping skills to get through the week when his energy reserves were taxed to the limit? \n\nNo, you just said \"Deal with it,\" and then punished him for getting creative.\n\nI'm not going to say that your actions went into AH territory, but I do think that you may be suffering the extrovert's sin of assuming that your child's social and psychological needs are the same as yours, and failing to help him figure out how to survive as an introvert in a prolonged social situation.\n\nNAH, just a lot of people not listening to each other.", "NTA \n\nThose are very reasonable sleeping arrangements. It was for a week, not his whole life. Your son is a brat and he learned the hard way that actions have consequences. The punishment was not extreme.\n\nHe could have relocated to the family room. He just want to have his own way.", "NTA. At all. You son, on the other hand\u2026.   Time for someone to wake precious prince up, and it obviously will not be his mother. Good luck sir, teens can be hell!", "ESH, but oh boy are we close to YTA. \n\nWhy in God\u2019s name are you expecting that many people to stay in one house for a week? Honestly, get a hotel. Like, the fact you have people sleeping on a pull-out bed should have been an indication that this wasn\u2019t going to work. \n\nThe only reason I say ESH is because your son is being quite unreasonable in his demands. But let me tell you\u2014he\u2019s definitely right to be pissed off", "I think the 16f deserved the \u2018privacy\u2019 more than he did, if he\u2019s gonna use that excuse, or your ex. \nNTA.  Tell him next time he doesn\u2019t have to come and make sure that you go to a place he\u2019s always wanted to go., \nI\u2019m petty like that", "NTA.\n\nI think you handled the situation very well.\n\nIn that house with so many people gathered, where was he expecting to be sleeping? In his grandparents bedroom?\n\nNo joking now. Where did he think he would get his \"privicy\"?", "YTA why the fuck did you have so many kids? Wear a condom, make your wife get on the pill, do something!", "I have a feeling that your son will remember this as the \u201cvacation from hell\u201d and will do whatever it takes not to repeat it.", "NTA. I immediately noticed that your teenage and tween daughter were rooming with a kid about the same age as the younger boys, plus a TODDLER and didn\u2019t complain. It is annoying not to have all the space in the world you want? Sure. Can he deal with rooming with his younger cousins for a week? Absolutely. \n\nAnd especially kicking the little out into the common area in the middle of the night? He could have gone out to sleep on the couch and that probably would have been an actual solution, but instead he tried to claim the entire bedroom when no one else had one to themselves. Just selfish teenage antics all around.", "YTA. I can\u2019t sleep with other people in the room and always made it everyone\u2019s business until they fixed it so I hope he does the same thing", "NTA.  Space was limited.  Everybody had to make do.  He's being quite the AH though.  Teenagers can be very...challenging.", "Question: Were you making your son go to bed at the same time as his young cousins? If so, I could understand his indignation. Also, for your own piece of mind, I wouldn't have taken away his laptop. If that distracted him from complaining, I would have let him have that and come up with another punishment-- making him sleep where he sent the kids for example.", "Why would you ever have that many kids and why would you ever think that many people could be comfortable in a 4 bedroom house?", "NTA and while some may call it \"being a teenager\", I call it unacceptable and worthy of appropriate consequences.  It was a single week, not a 20 year jail sentence for pity's sake.  That is selfish, bratty behavior.", "ESH - I get family trips, but packing a bunch of kids in a wide age range into 2 rooms sounds fucking awful. You don\u2019t seem to even consider that your son and daughter are different people with different tolerances for kids.\n\nHe\u2019s being a whiny asshole for sure, but you also give so few shits about his feelings that you completely disregard them.", "NTA. In my experience, children sharing by gender is the norm when extended family has to share limited accommodation space.", "He doesn't need his own room, but that is an unreasonable amount of people to have in four bedrooms for a week. If these trips are common, other arrangements really should be figured out. I'm going with YTA  largely because you were shutting your teenage son down instead of communicating and at least considering his concerns.", "Of course you're not. NTA\n\nThe fact he also refused the couch proves he's merely selfish.", "NTA. And way to go holding the line. \n\nYou offered him a VERY acceptable option - the couch. He didn't want it. That's on him.", "NTA - I don't see anything wrong with what you did. Whilst it may not have been ideal for him it was certainly fair for everyone. Not sure why a 15 y/o should have got a room to himself in those circumstances.", "YTA not a major one just a dumb one. That sounds like a terrible \u201cvacation\u201d for a 15 year old. You should\u2019ve known better. He is 15 bro. He can fly alone and will be just fine. Let him see his mom or hang out with friends while your gone. No 15 year old wants to go on a vacation and share a room with young kids. \n\nYour threat of sending him home almost sounds like a good deal.", "NTA.\n\nI expect a lot of people who grew up spoiled to respond with YTA comments. It is a 1 week trip. The arrangements are not ideal but he should be old enough by now to have learned flexibility.\n\nWhat I would say is try not to make a habit of it. At 15, I'd be pretty pissed off if I was looking forward enjoying time off from school and then got yanked on a family vacation I wasn't too keen on. It is harder for him because he doesn't have cousins who are close enough in age for him to bond with.", "NTA\n\nThe 16 yr old girl had to share a room with 3 other girls. The 15 yr old boy had to share a room with 2 other boys. 4 to 3. Nope he had the better numbers. It was a 1 week family vacation.  Unless those 2 other boys were harming him in some manner not mentioned in the post his behavior was atrocious.

It's clear that no one is winning with these sleeping arrangements - he can dislike it all he likes (amd I repeat - I can't think of many teens that would be wild about this holiday arrangement at 15) but he needs to get over it and stop ruining the trip.\n\nYour sons mom is feeding his self-centred attitude.

Curoius if OP had a real conversation about root issue or just assumed kid was being brat.", "And when is he going to see his family if he refuses to visit them because he has to share a room with his cousins?", "In 3 years he can decide for himself.", "The mistake is to call this a vacation. It is a family visit, not a vacation.", "Sure he could stay in a hotel, as long as he pays for it. We have a perfectly fine sleeping arrangement at my IL\u2019s house.", "I read it as he sent his cousins to camp out on the floor in the family room, not that he was joining them.", "He\u2019s not manipulating his cousins into sleeping on the floor of the family room just so he could get his own room. He could\u2019ve slept on the couch if he wanted it that bad.", "Lol it was technically a solution, wasn't it. But I don't think OP's son was camping with them, he just told them *they \"*could\"(should/would) be camping in the living room. Which when you're 5/7 being woken up out of your sleep and being told to do this by your 15 y.o. cousin, you're probably going to do, whether you want to or not.", "> but why should the family be put to the expense and logistical difficulties of the flight because a teenager is coping an attitude\n\n\"Oh, you want to go to mom's instead?  Have at it. Let us know when your flight leaves and we'll drop you at the airport\".", "Exactly this!", "When I was that age, If I didn\u2019t crack stick regularly I\u2019d fire off shots sleeping with wet dreams. Always woke up with a boner you could hang laundry on. It\u2019s a ackward age for boys.", "I think we're back to the privacy-to-masturbate issue then. hehehehe", "You forced him to join you on a trip he wasn\u2019t interested in? Just for this, YTA.", "The fact he had another option is why you're NTA. If he needs a room with a door to himself to jack off he can use the bathroom, but otherwise he doesn't have any better reason to need a whole bedroom to himself", "LMAO. I didn\u2019t realize this until my husband complained about the boys taking 45 minute showers.", "That\u2019s how showers get clogged and ruined\n\n\u2014-female college grad who saw letters regularly posted begging boys to stop nutting in the shower drains", "Perfect \ud83e\udd23.  Boy can control his \u2018needs\u2019 for 1 week!  I love that he lost his devices - now he has to handle things without visual aid.", "I can tell you the water and gas bill in our house is really suffering now that we have a tween boy. He takes 45 min showers every single day now. We're at the point we're going to have to have a talk with him about it, since the utility bills have jumped so much, and now others have to wait so long for more hot water. That's gonna be an awkward conversation...", "He also had the choice of the family room couch to himself. I don't feel bad for him at all. OP is NTA.", "I think 'getting everything they want\" is exactly what the poster meant.", "My, aren't we power hungry. Do not be surprised if this rebounds badly on you.", "Excellent answer.  My parents were in charge when we were kids.  Parents today have abdicated authority to their kids and look where it has led us.", "It would be annoying to just have to sit in bed and be quiet at 8 or 9 when your a teen who is used to staying up to 3 or 4 on non school nights. Not saying he isn't being dramatic but it would suck.", "I have a hard time sleeping when I can hear other people breathing, especially if I'm not used to them.  Granted it might functionally be alone-time, in that nobody is paying attention to me, but I don't tend to sleep well. I come from a big family though and didn't have my own room until I moved out, so I had to learn to deal with it, but it was still something that was hard for me.", "Perhaps the 16 year old is an extrovert. See how that works? Different people have different psychological needs. \n\nBut I'm fully prepared for getting downvoted into oblivion for actually pointing out some nuance and not calling a teenager stuffed into a house with 14 people an entitled brat.", "What we\u2019re his other options for place to be after 8. Was he banished to bedroom ?", "I doubt that when the pull out bed was purchased, they thought that meant that 8 children would be simultaneously staying", "No doubt, though I\u2019m sure there was at least one bathroom in the house he could use.", "They always had a choice I knew we could afford a hotel room and they chose not to so I didn\u2019t feel bad", "That\u2019s a bit sus the couch was always pretty fine for me as long as no one was getting up at like 5 which never happens on vacation", "No they\u2019re still related bc those things affect sleep quality. I\u2019d say he should just be his normal volume and if the kids wake up their parents can deal with it", "No they\u2019re still related bc those things affect sleep quality. I\u2019d say he should just be his normal volume and if the kids wake up their parents can deal with it", "This sounds like a truly fantastic holiday for a teenager /s \n\nI lean toward a soft esh in your direction as he is more the asshole than you are with his actions - but I must confess that I would have hated a trip like that, too. I mean you technically reached your goal of him seeing his family (other comment), but it sure wasn't the way to make him happy about it.", "You planned a week long trip with that many people and still thought it was a good idea to pack a tiny house like a can of sardines?", "Every heard of a hotel?", "It is a living arrangement, temporary or otherwise.", "Not even close to the posted situation.", "If you're asking me then I'm going to say I think he's well past puberty at 15 and masturbation is probably part of the issue. However, it's one week, he's part of a family and he can put up with it just like everyone else is doing.  He can go in the bathroom & masturbate then flush the tissues & go to bed.", "No he is just being a dick, that may be due to puberty though. Teenagers are assholes in general.", "Maybe he wants some independence. You guys have lots of kids, he's the only one in the teenage phase. He doesn't have the same interrests as the other kids anymore. He loves all family members, but isn't keen to spend time with them. It's called being a teenager.\n\nYou gave him roots, don't forget to give him wings as well. Try to find a middle groud.", "When he\u2019s older and an adult and can pay for Air BnB", "In 3 years they won\u2019t be obligated to haul his entitled ass with them.", "You\u2019re suggesting your 15 year old pay for his own hotel room? Have you lost your mind?", "Yeah he def took advantage of some kids to get what he wanted.", "Bathroom.", "Just wait until you find socks that are stiff as board in laundry.", "Good Lord! What are those boys eating? Drywall compound?!?", "That's a myth actually. Most of the time shower drains are clogged with hair. Semen dissolves well in water.", "I have dropped allot of chowder in shower, I can ensure you it doesn\u2019t clog shower.", "My father solved the long shower issue by turning off the hot water after 10 minutes, lol. 5 kids learned to plan showers around when he wasn't home", "He had a tablet and phone that could be used instead of the tv. Headphones always work well.", "He could\u2019ve read. He could watch tv as long as he keeps the volume down. If he didn\u2019t manipulate his cousins into sleeping on the floor he could\u2019ve played on his phone or tablet.", "I totally get that because I had the same problem. I would be filled with rage at trying to sleep when people were making breathing noises in the room with me. Finally reached a point where I would wear earplugs with headphones over them to drown the noises out. But that doesn't seem to be the issue here. The son said he was upset because he wanted to watch what he wanted to on TV and didn't want to have to interact with the cousins. If it was about sleeping, he was offered the couch in the family room, where no one else was.", "Perhaps the 16 yr old isn't selfish and knows the situation is for a week. This teen woke up and moved 2 sleeping little kids out of a bedroom instead of moving himself. This isn't about being introverted or extroverted.", "No. If he wanted to be in the bedroom after 8 he had to make sure not to wake his cousins up. He could\u2019ve watched tv in the family room or tried to spend time with his grandparents.", "It seems like he had the couch in the family room to himself as an alternative. So.. he had a room to himself. I don't think OP is the AH in this situation.", "True. Also with 32 people in house I\u2019m sure bathroom time is at a premium. Not much patience for \u201clong showers\u201d", "That just sounds childish and manipulative behavior. Should probably have that checked out", "We\u2019ve done it before and survived. The girls never complain even though their room has more people.", "Not everyone can afford to stay in a hotel for a week, just because a teenager threw a fit.", "What hotel suite are you paying for, where a family of 7 gets enough bedrooms for him to have his own room? He'd be luck to get his own \\*bed\\* in the scenario - likely sharing with dad or taking the floor.", "Ever heard of a functional family?", "Tell us you're privileged and entitled without saying you're privileged and entitled.\n\nI grew up in a 3 br 1 ba house with 7 people and survived. Since when is there a requirement for kids to each have their own room?", "Believe me as a once 15-year-old boy, they can find a way to do it even if they are packed into a telephone booth with 5 other people.", "Every have a night pop or wake up with morning wood ? That\u2019d be ackward waking up with shorts full of chowder while on living room couch.", "Big time agree on them just being assholes 99% of time.", "With a house full of people, it might not give one the peace of mind and time to prep, get in the mood, and perform to completion.\n\nThere's a process to this.", "When we were dismantling our boys' bunk beds to put in separate beds, I found one of those.  I asked the 13 year old about it and he actually said it was  stiff because of fabric softener.  My husband was yelling at me across the room not to touch it and then I realized what it was.  Mind you, I am not sheltered but I did buy him a box of Kleenex and some lotion.  LOL", "I think it\u2019s more the sheer numbers. Three boys, shower can handle. 300, no bueno.", "I don\u2019t know. I dropped hot soup while in a bath once and oh boy what a mess that was.", "I normally hate being wrong but these responses have me cracking up. Totally worth it.", "You seem awfully intent on making sure people call your own child an AH.\n\nTo me, that's concerning all on its own.", "Does he actually see them as his grandparents?  You slipped it in right there at the end that he is not ur wife's bio kid. Does he get along with her, her family and so forth?  Bc all of that cldve been adding to his attitude.  I mean overall its normal to jam kids into a room for vacay, maybe try to group them by age next time so bed times match up, but if u he does not like the blending of familys then y t a and this will only make him dislike it more.", "No not a ahole. But either is 15 year old. I think probably just a poor job of each communicating. Puberty is a wild time and there can be many explanations besides kid is brat or entitled.", "He\u2019s 15. I don\u2019t think he needs a long shower for that. Pretty sure he would be a minute man", "Just because they don't complain doesn't mean they don't feel the same way. \n\nHave you ever considered asking them instead of assuming that not complaining means they must be ok with it?", "That's because girls and boys are not the same.", "Why did two families have to visit the grandparents at once? That is setting the scene for failure.", "Hotels have more than 1 room...", "No one said that, try again.", "And yet many boys & men couch surf on family & friends couches.  Hun, if you wish to pick a fight with me, I'd suggest you surrender that idea now.  I won't give you a fight.  I have my opinion & I expressed it to the OP.  You have yours.
