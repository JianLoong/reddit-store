It shouldn't be a big deal since your friend won't have to pay for the extra dinner.

Both things are a nightmare to organize, so it's not something that can be easily changed. \n\nTbh I think you have to let him go. If he doesn't he probably ruins the wedding (for you) with his mood anyway.\n\nEdit: I just saw, that he is also the groomsman. So yeah, he kinda like really has to be there.

That sort of thing has always been a risk for even the most earnest RSVPs.

This is a cousin who is literally 2 months older than I am, we're each other's ride or dies, have each other's backs all times, etc. I skipped his bachelor party. Giant drinking parties aren't my scene and he understood. I was glad I skipped because half the wedding party ended up in jail that night. My cousin the groom had to bail his Best Man and another groomsman out of jail at 7:00 AM for a 12:00 PM wedding.", "I would say YWBTA if you said no.

And you can tell that she\u2019s looking to see if she\u2019s in the wrong by her wording at the end.

You give conflicting stories of why, first it was \u201ctraditional\u201d when it comes to commitments, but then in comments you also talk about not wanting to bother the bride and groom with another thing and also talk about RSVP deadline already passing (48 hours ago). To me these all point to the real reason you don\u2019t want him to go not being told here, heck you might not even have admitted it to yourself.\n\nAnd to all the comments of BF is an AH for not planning around this or blowing off this wedding\u2026 getting off your high horse.

Did he tell his friends he has an event that weekend during the planning phase (which he should have been a part of), or did he just say \u201cThat weekend works for me!\u201d?

You don\u2019t get to spend quality time meeting the bride and groom at a wedding. They\u2019re busy! You\u2019re lucky to get a few lines of conversation with them. If she wants him to meet her friends, they ought to have a dinner party or something, not a formal event.", "His friend needs support at his bachelor party? That seems a bit much. He would not be missing his friends actual wedding, the major life changing event, just the bachelor party. \nI\u2019ve been a bridesmaid and I\u2019ve been a bride, the wedding is more important than a bachelor/ bachelorette party and where it would matter if the bridal party was present. \nI get that most would rather go the the friend\u2019s bachelor party than the friend of a partner\u2019s wedding but when you tell someone you will do something with them, barring an emergency, you should stick to that commitment. He told his girlfriend he would go to the wedding so he should stick to his word and go.", "1. I misread. But actually, it sounds to me she brought that up as a \"tit-4-tat\". \"I went to those weddings, therefore he needs to come to my friends weddings regardless of the situation\". Keeping score like that? Unhealthy. \n\n2. I didn't say it was a wedding. The bachelor/bachelorette party of your good friend who has asked you to be in the bridal party is important to go to. More important than supporting your partner in attending the wedding of a distant friend of theirs who you've never met. (Distant bc if the relationship was THAT important, he would have met the bride at some point in the past few years). The RSVP was due TWO DAYS AGO according to OPs comments. 2 days! It's not a big deal to back out of a +1 this far in advance. \n\nShe can feel that her partner isn't supporting her, that's fine bc he isn't. But he can also feel that she isn't supporting him, which she isn't. \"I'm going to force my BF to come to a wedding of a Distant friend he's never met instead of being there for one of his best friends\" is selfish of her. If this was a family members wedding, or a really close friend and she's a bridesmaid this would be a different conversation.", "Okay, if they are 2 different things, then they can be seen. There are 2 important events for this person. Bachelor party isn't just getting drunk. it's an event just like the wedding of spending some quality time with a friend who is about to get married.

But she is keeping score and therefore this wedding of a person that isn't important enough for her to have interacted with in her 3 year relationship is supposedly a really important committment. \n\nIt is also worth being noted that she is leaning heavily on this formality thing she made up where you can't let the bride know multiple months prior of the situation.  Just a lot of immaturity all around and lack of compromise.  Life isn't black and white.", "Time Conflict happens all the time.

My Mom committed to an overnight church synod event she didn't really want to go to because the Pastor couldn't talk anyone else into going.  Unfortunately, a couple of days later we found out our cousin was having her first communion.  Mom won't be able to go, as much as she'd rather, because she already committed.

However, if he's previously committed, then it's up to the guys to change the date so he can be there.  Didn't they all pull out their calendars before setting the date?

Imo the issue was his attitude- he wants her to do things for him that he\u2019s not willing to do for her. Huge red flag", "this! it\u2019s weird people are calling her ah when she went for him but he can\u2019t go for her?", "You\u2019re right, however he\u2019s not avoiding it for no reason it\u2019s for an important bachelor party. She can either hurry and let her friend know and it won\u2019t be a big deal, or her or her friend can invite someone else in his place.\n\nIf he blew it off for no reason I would understand. And she has a right to be disappointed either way. But it\u2019s a friends bachelor party", "Where those two wedding on the night of her friends Hen party for which she was a bridesmaid though?", "And if it is a bachelor weekend, couldn\u2019t he just go for the part of it that ISN\u2019T coincident with the wedding? \nLike, couldn\u2019t he go to the wedding Saturday night and then join the crew on Sunday morning for breakfast or whatever? It might take some planning and hauling ass on OP\u2019s and BF\u2019s parts to make the travel work, but I bet it could be okay. They could even leave the wedding a little early if it makes it easier, as a compromise. Not perfect for anyone, but it would be alright.", "Which one sounds more important: \"my partner\", \"my boy from college\".\n\nThey just said it's not about which wedding to go to, it's about the BF's \"IDGAF, I'm going\" attitude and inability to compromise fairly with his partner. Prioritizing the things he cares about over things she cares about that he's already committed to. Everyone's just \"oh but he's the GROOOMSMANNN, IT'S MORE IMPORTANT!\", but IMO your relationship is more important than a bachelor party.", "He\u2019s \u201cbooked\u201d months away, his presence means nothing at one event, and significantly more at another. Y\u2019all act like a RSVP is a contract written in blood, and that there will be even a single person inconvenienced by him not attending the wedding.", "Many of the comments in support of the boyfriend are other selfish people who think their wants and needs are more important than anything else and will never have an SO or have to be in this situation.", "\ud83d\udc4e", "The distinction between the two in regards to this situation is irrelevant.", "I got married September 2022. I think they took our final head count like 2 weeks before? Maybe 3 or 4 at the absolute most. Definitely not 6.", "If the headcount is final couldn't she just bring someone else? Why would the couple care who she brings of they've already ok'd and paid for another person?", "Doubt.", "Going out the house to 2 events is a busy year for a lot of Redditors evidently.", "He made a commitment to attend for his partner's sake. Guess commitments go out the window if something \"more fun\" pops up. Very mature attitude he's got lol", "He's not a plus one. He was directly invited. The invitation was addressed to both of them.", "A plus one that they don't even know, either.", "Yeah every one of these partner vs friends posts has the same \u201cyour partner can\u2019t control you, you can do whatever you want\u201d bs. It makes it sound like Reddit is nothing but 20 year olds living their best life at the expense of their partners\u2019 feelings. \n\n\nOP goes to her bfs friends weddings she doesn\u2019t know because it\u2019s important to him. OP wants bf to come to one of her friends weddings because it\u2019s important to her and he says \u201cno I\u2019m not going now, I got invited to something better\u201d and everyone is mad at OP for being upset? If it was his friend\u2019s actual wedding or if he was the best man, I\u2019d say they each go individually, but as an adult you sometimes have to prioritize things that are important to your partner over partying with the boys. OP is NTA if this is a pattern and NAH if it\u2019s a one-off but the bf\u2019s reaction makes me think the former.", "Actually the older I get, the more I\u2019d prioritize a close knit party with my old buddies instead of sitting in a church with 100 people and going to a reception where you don\u2019t really get to spend one on one time with the couple.", "Literally commented on the clear age bias here lol. As you get older, you start to understand how to keep commitments, plan, take into account your partner\u2019s events, get excited about your partner\u2019s friends, etc. This is so silly and I hope OP recognizes that she\u2019s probably just outgrowing the bf.", ">Agree. Sounds like a bunch of young people who think the drinking party is the most important part about a wedding. Get a little older, and the groomsmen missing the bachelor party due to adult obligations is actually the default.\n\nI'm in my mid 30s...I wouldn't miss my friends hen party where I was a bridesmaid to attend a wedding of my boyfriend's friend who I have never met!! My priority would lie with my friend and I would hope my boyfriend would understand that.", "I\u2019m 36, I\u2019ve seen a groomsman miss a bachelor party a single time and it was because his wife was due to give birth.  \n\nThe older I get the more people want to try and see friends for a trip away, because you don\u2019t see each other day to day as much.", "It\u2019s a difficult situation for everyone involved but I think OP is not in the wrong. OP did her best to get to know her boyfriend\u2019s best friends, that\u2019s what a good partner does. But now when it comes to HER best friend, he calls her \u201ca random person\u201d and uses the typical \u201cyou are not my mother\u201d excuse which is really insulting. Of course OP feels sad! Had he explained his point of view rationally, this would be a n.a.h, but now it\u2019s NTA.", "Heck, when I got married we expected people who RSVPed to no show last minute and were 100% correct. It just part of the territory.", "Or just revoke your +1/update your RSVP. The wedding is still months away.", "This. I went to a friend's wedding last year by myself after my husband fell ill (he was a friend of the couple too, and basically our entire friend group was either in the wedding party or attending.)\n\nIt sucked but that's what happens as adults sometimes. I ended up basically being the +1 of one of the bridesmaids. We had a blast though", "He is effectively a plus one tho. He doesn\u2019t know them at all.", "Agreed! Being bummed that my husband can't go to a wedding with me is VERY different than asking him to blow off his good friend's important night/bachelor party just to sit with me at my friend's wedding. OP has all the rights to feel sad about the conflict in schedules.. but she's TA if she tries to force him to blow off the bachelor party just to sit with her at a different wedding.", "Is it her best friend? Cause him not meeting her best friend for 3 years seems kind of odd.", "Bachelor party maybe beats my SO\u2019s friend\u2019s wedding if I\u2019m the best man\u2026. And only if I agreed to the Bachelor party first. Other than that he\u2019s showing that her priorities are lesser than his in his eyes. He can make plans that override hers.", "This is 100% insane. Bachelors party for your buddy who should\u2019ve taken your schedule into account does not take precedence over an actual wedding of your partner\u2019s friend that you RSVP\u2019d for. *Unless* you\u2019re a bit selfish and immature. Then I guess you do you and then eventually when you see the consequences of your selfishness, you grow up.", "He\u2019s a criminal, that\u2019s who he is! A vigilante! A public menace!", "He was meant to destroy the sith, not JOIN them!", "Tbh, I think that her \"traditional\" mindset is just a ploy for convenience here. I get that I have no evidence to support my doubt, but it's just too convenient that her mentality is at odds with this scenario, and I doubt she'd hold to it if the tables were turned. Perhaps I'm wrong, but that's how I feel at the moment.", "Exactly", "Agreed. So in this instance, he already had plans & can\u2019t go.", "I don\u2019t think the argument about being a plus 1 really applies here though. OP said the reservation was addressed to OP & her bf, not her and a +1. It\u2019s a tough situation all around, but +1 does not apply.", "I mean, she gets to express her wishes and her opinion and try to persuade him to do what she wants and feels is right.\n\nBut I am troubled by her telling him he's not going. She doesn't have that authority. She's not the boss of him. YTA.\n\nAnd as everyone has noted, although I understand her sense of fairness with the \"I went to your friends, you come to mine\", the circumstances of the conflicting obligations favor him going to the bachelor party.", "Why would they change a whole bachelor party plan for one person? That\u2019s unreasonable. Op is also being unreasonable. It\u2019s absurd to think he should go to the wedding of someone he doesn\u2019t even know instead of the bachelor party for a friend whose wedding he is part of", "Couldn't have put it better.\n\n Understandable if it's an important event, but a bachelor party is nothing more than some guys having a good time together. It's not essential, it's not the important part of the process, it's literally just an excuse to drink and have a fun time. Missing it isn't going to affect the wedding, plenty people don't make these things, just have to accept clashes happen and as an adult you can't always go to everything you want. \n\nThe fact he's groomsman changes nothing, if it was that important he go due to his role at the actual wedding then he'd have been involved in the planning and they'd have organised a date he was available.", "She said it\u2019s one of her best friends from college so I was going with that", "This. How does the groom not poll this groomsmen to see if they\u2019re available?", "Get me a picture of Groomsman!", "There's not really much of a conflict, is there?\n\nFor wedding A he is the guest of a guest and the people getting married do not know him.\n\nFor wedding B he is in the wedding party and it's a long time close friend getting married.\n\nAll events are months away.  I don't understand why this is even a line of conversation.  He goes to the event for B, she goes to A, everyone meets up at home afterwards.  No problem.", "Exactly! Many of the wedding venues in my area don\u2019t require a finalized headcount for the wedding until a month out. A majority of the invites I receive have an electronic RSVP code where you\u2019re able to change your response or edit the number of guests able to attend. \nExactly like you said, the sooner you inform the hosts of a change weeks before the RSVP deadline, they won\u2019t need to worry about paying for an absentee guest\u2019s plate.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ll add on, please always clear bringing a substitute plus one with the hosts. Some of them may need to meet a wedding venue\u2019s minimum guest count and would prefer to invite folks who are closer to them but couldn\u2019t due to capacity issues. \n\nI understand where OP is coming from, because it\u2019s disappointing when plans change. Not having your SO attend can be a drag if you don\u2019t know anyone on the guest list and aren\u2019t close to the folks getting married. However, this is OP\u2019s close college friend and I am willing to wager that she knows someone on the guest list. She can survive one reception without her boyfriend.", "Also have been a bridesmaid in this culture and have been to one weekend bachelorette party that two bridesmaids could not attend. \n\nWe had a group chat to plan but sometimes the bride is super busy - in my case, in charge of a building of college dorms that required her to be available in the city most weekends - and only has a few weekends off, so you pick the one that works best.", "Hell, at my wedding I don't even remember meeting guests I didn't know beforehand, and we only had about 40 people, tops. My dad threw a bigger party in my hometown afterwards, and it was a blast, but I don't remember seeing some of the people who I DO know. And that was an all-day picnic!", "Yeah if the roles were reversed everyone would be accusing OP of being controlling.", "We're just ignoring COVID now?", "Thank you. Reddit is downright creepy about stuff like this. Like everything is a purposeful conflict.", "Even if he did, why should the groom have to change his plans for a person he doesn't even know? The boyfriend isn't missing an important event. He doesn't even know OP's friend. It isn't that hard to attend events separately.", "I\u2019ve been on 4 bachelorette parties, it\u2019s also by availability of everyone. Parties have ranged from 4-15 people.", "Nor did I pay for my entire bachelorette party", "I actually DO feel like OP is acting controlling, even without the role reversal. She said something to the tune of her being the type of person to keep her commitments, which is nice and good and all. But there has to be some flexibility because life isn't perfect. So she's getting hit with a growing moment, but instead of rolling with it she's digging in her heels causing a rift because she doesn't like that BF won't cave to her need to 'stay committed' to a date set way in advance. Trying to get him to blow off his friends bachelor party to stay as her plus one 'because he committed' just screams controlling to me for sure.", "I can\u2019t believe people are using covid as an excuse to be completely unfamiliar with a \u201cclose friend\u201d for 3 years??", "I'm with you I'm 12 years together and this year got a calendar in the house that we actually use for the first time. still don't use a joint e-calander", "Last year I set up a Google Sheet calendar so that a bunch of us on a stag party could determine a day we all could do. That being said, shared docs and email surveys are way too new to be considered to be a cultural norm. Traditionally you'd be told the date.", "This is the way!", "I think this is just a case of everyone being different on organization. I\u2019m the best man and currently arranging a stag (UK) - the remit from the groom is that he wants as many people there as possible so I went out with a few different date options that all the groomsman could do and then went with the date that the majority of the rest of the guys could do. \n\nBoth work - just depend on what people want"]}
