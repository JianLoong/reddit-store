It shouldn't be a big deal since your friend won't have to pay for the extra dinner.

If it's about commitment, did your SO commit WITH you or did you commit FOR him?\n\nNow an anecdote for all you commenters who don't know your head from your ass (\"It's an 'obligation' because SO is in the wedding party\") :\n\nI was a groomsman in my cousin's wedding about 10 years ago. This is a cousin who is literally 2 months older than I am, we're each other's ride or dies, have each other's backs all times, etc. I skipped his bachelor party. Giant drinking parties aren't my scene and he understood. I was glad I skipped because half the wedding party ended up in jail that night. My cousin the groom had to bail his Best Man and another groomsman out of jail at 7:00 AM for a 12:00 PM wedding.", "I would say YWBTA if you said no. Its in advance so you can ask maybe a friend to go with you instead or let your friend know that you will be attending on your own as she might be able to fill the seat or whatever.", "Stop making stuff up to control him, smfh. You just don't want him going to the bachelor party. YTA.", "I understand your disappointment\u2026. So far no one is the asshole. He\u2019s the groomsman at his friend\u2019s wedding, of course that wedding and bachelor party are far more important to him. \nForce him to go with you and you will be TA. Just accept that sometimes timing is unfortunate, you need to adapt accordingly. Let him go to his friend\u2019s party and tell your friend you\u2019re coming alone.", "All these comments so hastily saying YTA\u2026 I think it\u2019s a tough situation, especially if she\u2019s more traditional in these ways. It\u2019s clear that this isn\u2019t coming out of a controlling place, but more out of an anxious place for changing the plan for her friend\u2019s wedding. And you can tell that she\u2019s looking to see if she\u2019s in the wrong by her wording at the end. I think it\u2019s a tough situation, and if either person in the relationship pressed hard for their way without trying to see the other person\u2019s side, they\u2019re the asshole", "NTA", "Yta. Your title alone sounds controlling..your bf isn\u2019t your child and he doesn\u2019t need your permission. If you were an adult you should have sat him down and had a discussion. This is important to him to go celebrate his friend, just as this wedding is important to you. Instead of taking him you could have taken a friend of someone else with you.", "Ok I\u2019m married and if my husband is accompanying me to my friend\u2019s wedding even if he doesn\u2019t know her he has a commitment with me first. If his friend wedding is in December why is the bachelor trip in summer? A trip is carefully planned and he could have said he couldn\u2019t that weekend but didn\u2019t cared enough to do so. OP you can\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d him do anything but he\u2019s being disrespectful towards you and showing you were you stand in his priorities. Do with that information as you will. NTA if you don\u2019t keep insisting, just be clear about your feelings and let him decide", "NTA and I already saw people disagree, but if OP sat through 2 weddings and this is a bachelor's party not even a wedding, I wouldn't bail on my wife and fight about it. Anyone saying YTA are the kind of people who ask for help moving but won't help you move.", "You had expectations and now there's a glitch. Your boyfriend's argument is valid. If I was in your situation, I would agree that he attend the bachelor party and I would attend my friend's wedding. Maybe you could ask a friend or family member to be your +1. If you insist that your boyfriend attend the wedding under these circumstances, neither of you will have a good time. Compromising on this issue would be the best solution.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend made a commitment to attend the wedding with you and now he needs to uphold that commitment.  That's part of being in a relationship- keeping your word.  Emergencies (such as sickness or a death in the family) are excuseable, but that's not the case here.  He wants to bug out because something better came along in his mind.\n\nIt sucks for your boyfriend that he will miss out on the bachelor party for his friend.  I get it.  But also- why did he not tell his friend he was busy that weekend?  Maybe a different weekend would have been chosen.", "YTA. While it might sound admirable to \u201cbe tradition when it comes to commitments\u201d, it\u2019s really not. Life happens and you need to learn that and also how to be flexible or else you\u2019re in for a long life of unnecessary stress in the name of being \u201ctraditional. Especially in this circumstance where it\u2019s so far in advance. If it was a week away or heck even a month it\u2019s a different story, but there is plenty of notice here to change an RSVP that was just due. \n\nYou also need to be truthful with yourself on why this is an issue. You give conflicting stories of why, first it was \u201ctraditional\u201d when it comes to commitments, but then in comments you also talk about not wanting to bother the bride and groom with another thing and also talk about RSVP deadline already passing (48 hours ago). To me these all point to the real reason you don\u2019t want him to go not being told here, heck you might not even have admitted it to yourself.\n\nAnd to all the comments of BF is an AH for not planning around this or blowing off this wedding\u2026 getting off your high horse. OP and her BF are in their mid 20\u2019s as I assume most of their friends. life is BUSY at that age with weddings and careers and schedule conflicts are unavoidable. For all we know there is 5-6 or more people they are trying to find a weekend for that works and everyone has a conflict. OPs BF may have said \u201cthat weekend doesn\u2019t work\u201d but maybe it\u2019s the one that worked for everyone else?", "Nta. He is showing you how important you are to him. And what your feeling means to him. He made a commitment to attend. \nWhat is the value of a person who cannot abide by their word. \nFind a better partner. It's not too late. He will never prioritise you.", "I think you were looking to see some commitment from the BF. You wanted to see if he\u2019d chose you, like you have chosen him. However- this will be a once in a lifetime event for both his friend and your friend. I\u2019d be very annoyed at the situation, but if he didn\u2019t chose the date, he had a prior commitment also (being in a wedding party is a commitment, with an understanding that you\u2019ll be attending certain events). \n\nThis is also a chance to dial in your expectations and your own commitment. Did he tell his friends he has an event that weekend during the planning phase (which he should have been a part of), or did he just say \u201cThat weekend works for me!\u201d? The answer to that question would determine how I handled events with him in the future.", "If he's never met the person. Just bring someone else.  What difference would it make.", "She went to two weddings for him where she didn't know anyone.   Time for reciprocity.   Plus he made commitment.", "So would you say NAH for this case, since both sides are understandable and honestly no one's really being an asshole here?", "Why can\u2019t OP and her BF just split up for the night? OP can go to her friend\u2019s wedding, and bf can go to his bachelor party. You don\u2019t cease to be an individual when you are in a relationship.", "Not to mention, a June wedding wouldn\u2019t have a February RSVP due date", "I\u2019m guessing this round of RSVPs was the A-list. It\u2019s so early to have RSVPs due for a wedding in June. Bride and groom are sending another round now that they know who\u2019s coming from the A-list. Tacky as hell. \n\nOP: YTA. I have had this situation before and I went to my friends thing, BF went to his friends thing. NBD. Your friend hasn\u2019t turned in head counts to anyone yet as those are usually due a week or two weeks before.", "This is my take as well.  OP seems more annoyed at the fact that she would need to change the RSVP than the fact that he's not going.  She states that 'if we had not RSVP'd it would be different',  which means had she known in advance, she'd be fine with it.  The wedding is still a ways away and I doubt final count has been given or that the place settings have been assigned.", "But but but they asked the rsvp\u2019s by april 14th!! \ud83d\ude00", "THIS OP read THIS \ud83d\udcaf", "Definitely getting the vibe that they knew he was a groomsman before the rsvp deadline. She just rsvpd anyways to force his hand and is mad it isn't working.", "Your comment is the only one that I didn't find confusing. I don't understand why ppl think the problem is that the bride will be upset or that OP doesn't want to go alone. It sounds to me like OP is upset that she went to 2 weddings for him (ppl she didn't know) and now he is picking a drinking party over attending a wedding with her. She didn't just point out that she went to those two other weddings for no reason.", "I think this is exactly it.", "That may be it, but you also have to note that he is a groomsman of his friends wedding.", "OP's boyfriend is the *groomsman* for his buddy, and doesnt know OP's friend whose wedding they're attending. \n\nWhich one sounds more important?", "There\u2019s always a bigger issue!\nOP sounds young/doesn\u2019t want to travel solo. Op- perhaps you can travel with other friends going to the wedding? Or perhaps your plus one could extend to somebody else the bride actually knows", "Do you not know how to read? The bf is blowing off prior commitment to go to the bachelors. It\u2019s not 2 weddings on the same day.\n\nFrankly when the bachelors was being planned your bf should have told them he was busy. What an AH. I wouldn\u2019t be attending any weddings going forwards where you have no connection to the bride/groom.", "Exactly this! It\u2019s not what he decided, it\u2019s how he did and his reaction to it.  Especially in a long 3 year relationship.", "I dont see any situation where she has to \"let\" him go.\n\nThat dude is going no matter what, and he probably doesnt care about OP's permission.", "This summarizes my feelings. This is all sorts of red flag behavior from the bf.", "This is my take as well. It isn't some brand new relationship where they live separate lives. \n\nHe made a commitment, and now he is backing out of it and calling OP names to try and get her to feel bad/back down. I would be so pissed off if he was my bf. Really not understanding the Y T A votes.", "Right? My ex and I attended and were in multiple weddings while we were together, and the bachelor/bachelorette parties scheduling was always a group effort of sharing calendars and picking a date. I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s boyfriend shared all the info with his friends or with her about the scheduling of this party. Plus, it\u2019s not uncommon that someone can\u2019t attend the bachelor party but they\u2019re still in the wedding. The wedding is the important thing to attend, especially in this day and age. It\u2019s not like the bachelor party is ACTUALLY the last time any of these dudes will party together. It\u2019s pretty disrespectful to just tell your partner your bailing on a committed plan and then get pissy about them being upset about it. NTA, OP, but also he may not be a fun date to this wedding.\n\nMy ex also used to pull the \u201cbut I don\u2019t know anyone there\u201d when it came to attending things with me and then would get really upset if I said the same about one of his planned gatherings.

When you agree to be a groomsman or bridesmaid it\u2019s because you are a significant part of that party, a close friend and wanted to be part of the whole experience. Accepting is accepting just that. It\u2019s unfortunate that the party date hadn\u2019t been set but now it has. Her attendance of his mates past weddings are irrelevant, and comes across point scoring. She was able and free so went. I don\u2019t even understand her reluctance.\n\nI wonder how she would feel if her best friend was getting married, she was bridesmaid and he told her you are not going to her hen do because my mate you\u2019ve never met, is getting married. To refuse him being apart of those memories forever and everytime the party is mentioned he had no part in it. It is just cruel. Now if it was a family members funeral where she needed support, that would be different.", "He doesn\u2019t care about her friends? Why would he? He\u2019s never been introduced to this friend in 3 years? She also unilaterally made the decision and told him he couldn\u2019t go do his groomsman duties because why? They RSVP\u2019d? People are allowed to change their plans when new information becomes available.", ">IMO the friend should have checked with his groomsmen if they have a scheduling conflict for the bachelor\u2019s trip.\n\nI'd be willing to bet that they did, and OP's boyfriend simply didn't say anything about this other wedding.", "Bachelor party has zero to do with commitment to his friend. I been to 10 or so destination bachelor parties. 80% of the time they go very sideways.

She says it\u2019s a best friend from college, but she\u2019s not in the bridal party so she just attending as a guest. \n\nThe BF is in the bridal party of the other wedding and therefore has more responsibilities and should take precedence over the first wedding. OP can simply tell than she\u2019ll be coming solo, changing an RSVP is not a huge deal months ahead of time.\n\nAlso, how much time would they have spent together at this wedding really? Let\u2019s be honest, OP is a 24yo recent college graduate attending the wedding of a college friend her BF has never met. This is very likely going to be a party for the girls dancing and drinking and BF would be off to the side, ready to carry her shoes and drive her home. \n\nPlus, now even if she gets her way and makes him skip out on his groomsmen duties to attend this wedding, his attitude is going to rightfully be shot.\n\nShe\u2019s manipulative and controlling and likely just wants to show off that she also has a man to all her college friends.

That's not how events like weddings work.  If it was really that important they would have taken his availability into account when planning for the bachelor party.", "It\u2019s nuts that everyone in a wedding is expected to drop another $5,000 on an event that is ripe with bad behavior and peer pressure to take part in that bad behavior.

Depends highly on the size.  In my friend groups last bachelor party there are 16 in our group and the perfect day didn\u2019t exist.  So we maximized attendees at the expense of some.", "It\u2019s really not that complicated lol", "So bride and groom should change the plans for op ?he sure must be special!", "It could be a sporting, music, or other event that the groom enjoys whick takes place on one specific day. It could be an outdoor activity that is best during a particular season. It doesn't really matter. As adults, we have to make choices and priorities and it's not unreasonable to choose a close friend's wedding activities over a partner's friend's wedding activities.", "You don't plan a bachelor party around one groomsman.", "No, it\u2019s weird that you\u2019re trying to blame the boyfriend (him not caring) or minimise his role in the wedding.\n\nYou have no idea what other constraints there may be affecting the choice of date. Some bachelor parties have 20 or so guys going. You already have to find a date that works for the groom, best man/best men if there are multiple, potential brothers or other family members\u2026 then there are other factors like school breaks and a million other things to take into account.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable that that is the date they\u2019ve chosen and didn\u2019t check with OP\u2019s partner for his availability and that is the only/best date available.\n\nOP just needs to be less self-centred. Yes she went to the weddings of his friends, but she shouldn\u2019t hold that against him, suggesting that he now was to repay the favour. If that\u2019s how she\u2019s going to see things then maybe he shouldn\u2019t invite her to join him at the weddings.", "I see your POV but at the same time wedding's aren't the only place they can meet each other's friends, being at a stranger's wedding as a plus 1 isn't as important as being a groomsman at a bachelor party. Also OP isn't respecting him because she is trying to control him.", "It\u2019s a false equivalency as the girlfriend didn\u2019t indicate she had a conflicting event when she attended those 2 weddings.", "Nah just because she wanted to and went willingly (with probably no other plans) doesn't mean he should as well, ESPECIALLY if he has a wedding event type thing to attend to. \n\nIt's not an important event to him.. I don't see why that's a problem either. He doesn't know her, he's needed as best man somewhere else. \n\nIt's disrespectful of OP to act like she has any say in what he's going to do, as she's not his mother and thus doesn't get to decide for him", "It absolutely is. An event for a wedding that *I'm a part of* would and should take precedent over the wedding of someone I've never met. Sometimes plans change and this is one of those times", "O bullshit. If he is in the wedding party it is. That\u2019s a huge responsibility. My wife had to miss an important work event for my job to attend a bachelorette party where she was the maid of honor. She felt terrible but there was no way I was going to let her miss that celebration.", "It makes sense considering anything could happen in four months that meant someone who had previously been available suddenly couldn't attend. \n\nPersonally I wouldn't force my boyfriend to miss a close friend's bachelor party to come with me to a wedding where he doesn't even know the bride and groom. That's really all it comes down to since I don't believe for a second OP is actually troubled over the fact that they're gonna have to go back on their word to the bride. It's two months away and she doesn't even know OP's boyfriend, she won't care lol. I think OP is mad that her boyfriend is prioritizing an event with his friends over an event with her and her friends.", "Yes, but did you skip the pre wedding stuff when you were bridesmaid?\nBecause he demanded it that is...", "This is seriously not the hill to die on.  Let him go to his event with people he loves.  Go to your friends wedding either by yourself or bring a friend.   Tell your friend early, it will be fine.  If you force your boyfriend to miss the bachelor weekend your relationship will not be fine.", "And has your boyfriend demanded that you, as a bridesmaid, skip the bride's bachelorette to attend a wedding for a friend of his that you do not know?\n\nSorry YTA. There is plenty of time to either let your friend know you won't be bringing a plus one (which is his only role in your friend's wedding) or, if you can't handle going by yourself for some unknown reason, choose a different friend to go with you.", "Lol my wife would be mad if I didn\u2019t go. Sucks people stay with controlling partners.", "Yeah, and groomsman bachelor party trumps girlfriends never-met friends wedding. \n\nI think everyone's wording it wrong that the commitment isn't to the girlfriends friend, but to the girlfriend. But even then, they're coming to the right conclusion", "I really don\u2019t think they ever have been, lol. But that\u2019s AITA for you. People here seem to think that all relationships should have the same level of obligation to each partner as a FWB situation, doesn\u2019t matter if the couple have lived together for 12 years and have 8 children, commitments to your friends should come before your partner.", "I have been in 3 relationships before and none of them involved my S/Os telling me where I can and can't be.", "Have you ever been in a noncontrolling relationship?", "In my culture (US), the groomsmen plan (and usually pay for) the bachelor party and same for the bachelorette with the bridesmaids.  Of course plans and dates have to be good for the bride and groom, but the whole group usually decides dates together that work for the most people.  It is clear that the groomsman bf didn't say anything about his conflict (it wasn't a conflict to him to be his girlfriend's date at a wedding), especially with how far in advance the bachelor party is from the wedding.", "You could go as far as to say a wedding is a terrible place to meet the bride or groom. They might be able to say hello while they make the rounds between tables, but you're not going to get to know them at their wedding. It's been three years and meeting them hasn't been a priority before now.", "I edited my post to reflect how I feel now after reading some of the comments. I do agree with you, except for the \u201che doesn\u2019t know her so it\u2019s not important\u201d. It should be important to him because it\u2019s important to OP. HOWEVER, in this situation it is not more important than this bachelor party. If he was backing out at the last minute because his friends invited him on a random trip and he said he was free, then it\u2019d be a problem.", "[deleted]", "We differ in opinions and that is fine.", "100% my thought as well.", "Yeah I have noticed this a lot in Aita. My husband and I have separate friend groups. We don\u2019t even like all of each others friends.  But when planning things with our friend groups, if we want the other person involved it is treated as a priority over your own friend group. Just takes a lot of communication and obv there are exceptions.", "Did any of them have any consideration for your partner? Because that\u2019s what seems to be lacking here.\n\nI agree with the \u2018don\u2019t act like a mother and just tell your bf\u2019, but I also think bf is just being a total ass with no consideration to the prior commitments and leaving his gf in the lurch.", "Or he can do what he wants and celebrate the wedding of someone who is vastly more important to him. Its about that. The girlfriend and you are both nuts for expecting him to go the wedding of her friend instead of the bachelor party of the wedding he is a part of. Schedule conflicts and changes happen, if one person dropping out ruins the wedding 2 days after the rsvp were due then they just suck at planning. \n\nAnd frankly if my girlfriend came at me with this shit she wouldn't have to worry about attending the weddings of any my other friends or me going to her friends at all", "Of course it\u2019s fine. Have you never been in a wedding party for a best friend?", "Nope. None of my friends are married yet. But if I was planning a bachelorette party for one of them we would pick a date where everyone is able to attend without pissing off their partners.", "Ha that explains it. Between venue, car rental, hotel, bookings, appointments you can\u2019t please everyone. It\u2019s just not possible. I\u2019ve been the best man at several weddings. Sometimes people that want to go can\u2019t. Sometimes people have to make decisions on what to attend. That\u2019s life. You\u2019re stuck in this world where you would do everything right and no one would miss anything. That\u2019s not reality. By the way it\u2019s not the point of the question either. The question is should she make her bf go to a wedding when the batchelor party in that same weekend. He\u2019s in the party. Of course not. I don\u2019t know why you are stuck in this fairly tale \u201cif I planned it all would be well\u201d it\u2019s too late for that. The planning portion has passed.", "Lol easier said than done.  Sometimes you have to pick the date that maximizes attendees accommodating every last person.", "No it doesn't explain squat. If you as the groom find it important that all your groomsmen attend, make sure the date does not inflict on planning for them or their partner.   \nWe have a fairly large friend group and everyone has a partner and we can still pick dates that suit everyone. I mean acting like it can't be done is nonsense.   \n\n\nNot only that but he is saying that attending the bachelor party is more important than his GF and her feelings. She attended weddings where she didn't know anyone for him. Now that it is his turn \"miraculously\" the bachelor party got planned on the weekend HE had an obligation to her. That is sketchy in the first place. Second .. he knows she takes these commitments very seriously. He is showing his GF that he cares fuckall about her feelings or his commitments to her. Personally.. I would not want a partner who treats me this way. Better to be single. Luckily I have found an amazing husband who cares about my feelings and our commitments and I have amazing friends who wouldn't make me choose in a situation like this. There would be a new date for the bachelor(ette) party.", "So what is a SO the bridal party has never met other than a random person??? If they've never met the OP could walk in with anyone and be like \"hey this is my SO!\""]}
