{"id": 25284, "submission_id": "15y6pao", "title": "AITA for refusing to turn of the dryer despite my landlords repeated requests?", "selftext": "So some context. I live in a short term rental situation as I was relocated for work to support a specific location. I rented a nice garage in LA that has been repurposed as an ADU (accessory dwelling unit) for 3 months. I was interested in this rental because it is in a really nice area, close to the beach, and the owners had very positive reviews. But since it is an ADU I am basically living in their garage which is detached from their main house and separated by about 75 feet. \n\nWhen it comes to work i am very busy. I usually work from 7-5 and then go to the gym afterwards. On a usual day I don\u2019t get home until around 8pm, which is when I have to do all my other normal human activities like making lunches/dinner, do laundry, etc. \n\nWell it turns out my landlord absolutely CANNOT sleep with my dryer on which I usually have running from about 9-10pm. He is an older man, about 60 years old and retired, and usually goes to bed early. But on the first day that I did laundry he walked back to the garage around 9:15 and knocked on the door. When I open it he\u2019s in his underwear telling me to turn off the dryer. I calmly explain to him that I didn\u2019t get home until late and my clothes are wet and the dryer should be finished around 10pm. To this he grunts and walks away. He then came back at 9:50 and tells me to turn it off again to which I reiterate that it will be done in 10 minutes.\n\nThis has happened each time I\u2019ve done laundry on a weekday and he escalated it to saying that the neighbors have been calling him nonstop about the dryer noise. If I was being a nuisance to the neighborhood I could understand his frustration so I went and knocked on the neighbors door, introduced myself, and asked if the dryer noise from the garage was bothering them. To which they said they had never called my landlord or even knew that\u2019s someone was living in the garage. So I figured he lied about the neighbors to try to get me to turn off the dryer so I continued to run it at my normal time.\n\nThings came to a head yesterday when he came back and yelled at me at the top of his lungs to turn off the dryer. I told him that he is being paid good money for me to live here and if he cannot handle the noise of his garage being lived in then he shouldn\u2019t rent it out. I need clean clothes for work and in my mind doing laundry at night is a pretty normal thing to do. Not to mention I sleep in the same room as the laundry machines when for him it\u2019s far away.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I feel like could be solved if he invested in some noise canceling headphones. Also it\u2019s not like I do laundry every day. Since this living situation is temporary I didn\u2019t bring my whole closet so I\u2019d say I do about 2 loads each week, one of which is on a weekday. \n\nSo what to you guys think, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692712803, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y6pao/aita_for_refusing_to_turn_of_the_dryer_despite_my/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both of you are overreacting about this when the most logical solution would be to wash the clothes at night and stick them in the drier in the morning.

Not yours to deal with.", "Can\u2019t you wash your clothes on weekday A and dry them the next day? That way you\u2019re never running the dryer between 9:30 or 10.

And, noise canceling headphones on your head while trying to sleep? That\u2019s not really comfortable, is it? NAH, but try to work with him. Like you said, it\u2019s temporary.", "ESH.\n\nWhy does everyone think noise-canceling headphones are a solution for everyone? They're not.

I can't understand why he'd lie to get his way.\n\nThis whole debacle just seems like two stubborn people refusing to be inflexible. You're just going to have to put up with each other until you move. You said the renters got great reviews, so you at least have to consider you may be the problem.", "YTA. Is there any reason you can't do your laundry on your day(s) off? He's also the owner so why should he have to adjust by buying noise canceling headphones?", "YTA, he\u2019s being a bit much over this.

It\u2019s a minor inconvenience but you\u2019re only there for a few weeks and you can make this minor accommodation for that time.", "NTA\n\n10PM is ok to run the drier.  He can get headphones or run white noise apps on this phone.", "YTA\nDo your laundry on the weekend. Or buy a drying rack. Or get home earlier. Or generally don't be an arsehole.", "ESH but INFO : It is really legal in the US to repurpose your garage and have someone living in there ?   \nI know for sure in the country I'm from  the garage owner would face legal repercussions for doing such a thing.", "Why don't you just do your laundry on your days off instead of so late at night?", "Yes, YTA.  \n\nJust wash your clothes in the AM!  Or put up the washer at night, and the dryer when you wake up!\n\nI mean: You know full well you're keeping him up.  Why not be a reasonable human here?", "YTA. Listen, one day a week you can skip the gym to do laundry. But the reality is you aren\u2019t working 7 days a week from 7-5.

At which you could skip the gym and do the laundry earlier. Part of co-habitating is making concessions and trying to be quiet. I don\u2019t see it as being a big deal but if it\u2019s against his bedroom wall it could be really loud.", "YTA. When you live somewhere that the neighbors can easily hear loud noises, you need to be respectful of \u201cquiet hours\u201d. You can change your gym schedule, do laundry on your day off, or as someone suggested put your laundry in the dryer in the morning.", "YTA do your laundry before you go to the gym or at weekends.  \n\nOr (crazy European idea) hang it up to dry instead of using the dryer.", "EAH, not really sure how loud the dryer is, but I have heard load ones, especially if drying say Blue jeans, that clanking of the metal will drive me nuts.
