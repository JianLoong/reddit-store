I just try not to talk to or date the people I work with. That's a can of worms that I've opened once before at a previous job and it blew up in my face, so I decided never again, with some exceptions of course, but ever since then I hadn't dated anyone from work in years and this girl would have been the first one since and I was only willing to break my rule for her because she showed constant genuine interest, wasn't hypersexual in her approach or flirtation, and she initiated making it very obvious her interest in me.\n\nLike clockwork she comes to my area and starts talking to me, she's flirting, I'm flirting back, then she slides her phone across my desk with her snapchat open and she says, \"We should talk outside of work, you should give me your snap.\" Smiling I responded, \"I don't want to give you my snap, but I'll give you my number.\" She tells me that she doesn't want to give me her number just yet, but if we talk enough and things go well on snap then we can exchange numbers. I tell her, \"No, thank you.\" And hand her phone back to her. Her smile drops and she walks away.\n\nLater one of the male coworkers comes up to me and asks what I did to make her cry, I responded, \"Nothing, she wanted my snapchat and I wanted to give her my phone number instead and she didn't want that. I don't think that's anything worth crying over.\" He then proceeded to tell me how much of a fucking asshole I am for not giving her my snapchat and how I should've just given it to her. I explain to him that I don't really care about his opinion and that I find it weird that he's so distraught about something that doesn't involve him at all and he storms off.\n\nThen as I'm in line waiting to clock out another male coworker confronts me about it, calling me a fucking asshole (they kept using both of those words lol) because she liked me and I should've just given her my snapchat, I respond that I don't really trust having conversations through most social media apps, but especially through snapchat because the conversations automatically delete after a while and using an app like that just feels like someone is hiding something from someone else and that's something that I do not care to be a part of so unless we met through online dating then it's either phone number or nothing at all. He tells me that I'm old for thinking things are still that way with exchanging phone numbers and how exchanging social media is the normal thing to do now. I tell him that I don't really care. He asks me about her feelings, I tell him she'll get over it, I'm only one guy, a little rejection is good for her character.\n\nSo...AITA?", "created_utc": 1691756393, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o7eoq/aita_or_am_i_not_up_to_speed_on_societal_norms/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Apart from that, you were well within your rights to have set your own boundries, and stuck to them.\n\n(PS -- Im with you on this -- cause to me, exchanging phone numbers is 'getting to know you' type stuff. The snapchat stuff is odd, considering you two know each other at work already and flirt(ed) so why the need to 'hide' behind snapchat?)", "NTA. And stay far, far away from her. You haven't even given her your phone number and you're already tiptoeing around a minefield.", "NTA - I find it hard to believe this is something that she would cry about.  It's not like you didn't like her, you wanted her number.  This smells fishy.", "NTA - you set a clear boundary and didn\u2019t budge on it, which is your right.

No should mean no.", "NTA \n\nShe's drama.  Why would two other people know what happened unless she went crying to them? what if you dated and upset her? everyone gonna hear about it.

You offered your phone number. My first thought is she has a boyfriend who checks her phone and she uses Snapchat to keep her dates hidden. Maybe  that's too harsh, but that's the first place my kind went.\n\nI'm not sure why she cried at work. That seems a little excessive, considering you were not really rejecting her, just her weird communication preference. Also, I don't understand doing this with someone you met irl.

Good grief.\n\nDude, don't date anyone from work and try to stick with women whose mentality is over the age of sixteen. Just my two cents...\n\nBtw, I didn't read of any rejection done to her--on the contrary. Just another communication option was presented.", "NTA. fuck snapchat. I don't even have an account on that garbage. \n\nI prefer discord for actual conversing cuz it has detailed logs and I can type long and detailed messages on my home PC instead of on a phone. but if discord ain't an option phone numbers are perfectly acceptable. \n\nit is a little old fashioned, but it's not like you rejected her. she rejected your phone number and has no place to be crying and causing drama. honestly you dodged a bullet if she's already being a drama queen like that.", "NTA but go to HR ASAP and report the incident before she does.", "I\u2019m old but I don\u2019t get this.

I met my husband on a dating app, we exchanged Snapchat and talked there before moving to text. It felt \"safer\" as I didn't know him. I met my ex in a college class. We exchanged numbers because we knew one another face to face. It's odd to reject a phone number and insist on Snapchat when you know one another as coworkers.", "NTA\n\nMy god what is wrong with people having standards, trying to maintain boundaries, then having randoms come over and say they are wrong for doing so? WTF? You stick to your guns, you have done nothing wrong. You are not responsible for her crying over this.", "NTA not everyone uses fucking snapchat ffs what a weird reaction on her part. \n\nBut maybe this does reinforce that it would be a bad idea to date a coworker again. \"Don't find your honey where you make your money\" is a good rule to follow.", "There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to actually talk to a person instead of messaging!", "NTA you\u2019re right and she proves you right\u2026. This is a reason you shouldn\u2019t shit where you eat- date where you work etc keep work colleagues just that work acquaintances.

She has showed you it\u2019s best to be professional only with her and the others (especially those that confronted you) at this work place.", "NTA.\n\nI mean, I do understand that these days, Snapchat is pretty much the way that teens and young adults are communicating, I'm sure some older adults too, so I think maybe that she was surprised and probably you need to think about using Snapchat in the future, but, there is certainly nothing wrong at all about just saying no thanks and moving on when it wasn't what you wanted. \n\nDo these people forget that for there to be a relationship/dating, both sides have to want it and should be happy with it? Sheesh!", "NTA, you're not even in a work relationship, and the bullshit has started.", "NTA - it\u2019s fucking weird and childish that she wanted your snap but not your number. It\u2019s not like one is more secure than the other and both are just as easily blocked. Please update us!!", "NTA\n\nI know that a lot of younger women seem to prefer snapchat rather than giving out their number because it adds another layer of protection. HOWEVER, she is being childish by crying and making such a fuss about it that other people also noticed. Those 2 colleagues are also weird to get so worked up about something that doesn't involve them. All their reactions seem so bizarre to me.", "Nta. Also, do people really still use snapchat? I deleted that ages ago and if someone wanted to talk to me on snap I would think theyre stuck in 2015. Maybe its just in my country that no one uses it anymore though", "Is this high school? Wtf? Nta", "NTA. This is very strange. If she actually single? She knows where you work so it's not like you are some random that she's afraid of stalking her if she gave her real number.", "Not an asshole but holy shit did you absolutely *fumble* that", "NTA\nAlso why cry about it to two other men? Sounds very sus. They had no right to approach you like that.", "ESH - I was with you until you said \"a little rejection is good for her character\". That's is just such AH vibe.", "Snapchat = carefree and no strings\nPhone number = expectations and permanency \n\nThat's about the new world understanding of the two.\nShe's basically said \"lets keep flirting and have some fun\", you've responded with \"No, Marry me first.\"  (Overly exaggerated for drama)", "YTA I only say this because it\u2019s fine not to want to use Snapchat but you didn\u2019t say that. You just said  \u201cNo\u201d. If you had said you don\u2019t have snap but have WhatsApp or literally anything else maybe this would have gone better.", "NAH. Ok, you are a bit behind the times. IDK why no one has mentioned this, but all my female friends who casually date or meet people through tinder communicate through snapchat or instagram before giving phone numbers. This is because personal phone numbers are often used for emails, accounts at stores, and work related things, and could easily be weaponized by a vindictive person. Honestly I agree with this. You never know if someone is off their rocker and hiding it well, and I would not risk my actual personal phone number before I've even gone on one date. What if you're the vindictive kind? She doesn't know you like that.\n\nYou are well within your rights to refuse and she should accept that, but communicating through snapchat for the talking phase/light dating part of a relationship is common in some circles. Saying you don't care about new dating social norms, and then coming up with some reason like everyone who does it is hiding something... doesn't make that much sense.

It could be argued that I found her on social media unwarranted if things go wrong and that could be used to paint a bad picture, phone numbers are different and more personal.", "Yeah, if it's been 8 months of actively talking, flirting, and eating lunch together I'm not using social media to talk to someone further. If she doesn't trust me at this point then she never will and I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for it to happen. \n\nIf I were some random guy at the bar or something trying to talk to her on a whim then I'd definitely understand the whole snapchat thing, but it's different considering the aforementioned time we've already spent together.", "Doesn\u2019t WhatsApp have your number connected though?", "You're kind of right, attraction for me only goes so far and doesn't always equal desire. I can still find her physically attractive, but with this new information of how she responds to a situation that isn't going her way I can say that I no longer find her mentally attractive or personally attractive. Like she's still damn beautiful, but I don't feel like anything beyond coworkers is now worth it because if this small interaction can set her off like this then imagine down the line in a relationship if and when we have real issues.", "I\u2019m a woman and I honestly don\u2019t understand the appeal of Snapchat. I\u2019ve been on dating sites and while I absolutely will not give out my phone number right away and don\u2019t like pushy guys who demand it for safety reasons, I just continue chatting on the dating app. Some guys also solely want Snapchat but why? They could easily send me unsolicited things that disappear and I\u2019d just have another platform I\u2019d have to block them on as well as the dating app. From what I\u2019ve seen though, I\u2019m the odd one out in that I don\u2019t do Snapchat or IG.", "Laying it out like that it does sound a bit dodgy. If I\u2019d been talking to someone for that long and they only wanted to use snap I\u2019d look at it as if they had a reason to hide messages sent by me. If you have a good feeling about her try and have a talk at some point if she\u2019s willing\n\nI\u2019d also recommend mentioning to your HR that those two guys were giving you shit for it as well", "Oh okay, thanks for explaining that to me!! \n\nI do think it's kind of naive of her to ask for social media. As a woman it's true it is usually used as a form of protection but she's still going to see you everyday at work so it's not like blocking you on SC/IG would change anything  for her\n\n\nETA: While I am not able to make a judgement here, I do find it weird that you'd be willing to make an exception for her but yet trust her so little. \n\nHave you had any bad experiences in the past that cause you to be so cautious?", "You used to be able to use like an email address but to be honest that was before meta bought it so maybe that doesn\u2019t work anymore", "Yeah man, maybe consider this another reason why you have your rule about work dating. Kinda like the universe is like \"bro dont you be thinkin with your other brain\".", "Wait, because she cried?", "I also don't get the appeal of it, but I've had multiple women tell me they were more comfortable with it for the reasons I said. I also don't have any social media, and the only reason I have snapchat was because of women I dated who insisted we talk on there. We always just spoke on the dating app at first, but then they wanted to talk on snapchat after we met in person.", "I assume because you don't need to give someone your phone number to connect with them on it, but you can still use your phone", "Yeah, I definitely wrote this all down in my little black book and will be making a stop at HR today when I get in just to keep them in the loop, I don't want a repeat of my last situation.", "Yes, I kind of mentioned it in the original post and I won't go into detail, but yes, I have had an experience before that made me aware of the risk that is talking to someone through social media, specifically snapchat.", "To each their own, I suppose. I\u2019m just also not big in to SM either. I have Facebook but that\u2019s mostly to keep up with family.", "Oh absolutely, and that\u2019s where I use it for the dating app and since that already has a chat feature, it seems silly to me to just go to a different app to do the same thing. That\u2019s just personal preference to me though.", "In that case NTA and I'm sorry for whatever you went through\n\nBest of luck in the future!!"]}
