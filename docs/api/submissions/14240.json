My fianc\u00e9e said had yes initially but now she has bowed out and my sister is angry about it. My fianc\u00e9e dropped out of being a bridesmaid because of the dress my sister chose for them. The dress doesn't have straps and it is a mini dress. My fianc\u00e9e says it is too short for her to be comfortable in. I couldn't find a picture of the exact dress anywhere online but I found something close enough and put a picture in my profile. The real dress has blue instead of the black and green parts. But that's the exact cut of dress my sister picked for the bridesmaids (in blue and purple). My fianc\u00e9e says she wouldn't be comfortable being in something so short and strapless for an all day wedding and reception or standing in front of 350+ people. Not to mention having photos all over social media.\n\nMy sister said no when my fianc\u00e9e suggested a different dress or being able to wear a cardigan or sweater over it as a compromise. So my fianc\u00e9e has bowed out and she didn't think it would be an issue since the wedding isn't until next year so it's not like she bowed out at the last minute. My sister says she doesn't understand why my fianc\u00e9e is uncomfortable because my fianc\u00e9e is a personal trainer and has the body for it. My sister also says it will look weird if she isn't a bridesmaid because all of the bride and grooms siblings and their spouses/fianc\u00e9s/fianc\u00e9es are in the wedding party so it would look strange if my fianc\u00e9e was missing. I support my fianc\u00e9e and don't want her to be uncomfortable. I don't care if no one else has an issue with the dress. My is so that's enough for me. My sister is furious though and she is mad at me too for not convincing my fianc\u00e9e to wear the dress. I refused to do that. Would I be the asshole for not convincing my fianc\u00e9e to wear the dress and for telling my sister to back off and leave her alone? My sister is pulling the I'm family and the bride card and has gotten our parents involved and they are on my back over it.

Moreso than that, your fiance gave reasoning that anyone can understand: \"No, what you are asking me to wear in order to fulfill this role makes me too uncomfortable and I decline the position.\" If your sister keeps pushing it, maybe ask the other bridesmaids how they feel about wearing such a short/revealing dress, your fiance might not be alone in her discomfort. All the bridesmaids having the same complaint might lead to your sister re-thinking her plan.", "NTA, Seems like your fiance handled it appropriately. She wouldn't play by the team rules so she opted out from the team.

She should want comfortable guests & participants.", "NTA.\n\nSome people are just not comfortable in that style dress, even of they have the body for it.\n\nYour sister is allowed to ask her bridesmaids to wear dresses of her choosing.  She is not allowed to bully others into wearing something they aren't comfortable in.  Also, it won't look \"weird\" if your fiancee isn't a bridesmaid.  Lots of wedding parties don't include couples.  Your sister is 36 - it's time to grow up and deal with the fact that not everyone is going to put aside their own comfort level for her dream wedding.  Your parents and family should butt out of this.\n\nTalking your fiancee into wearing something that she would feel uncomfortable in all day would be an A H move.

I wish more men would do this. I looked at the dress and honestly I would never feel comfortable in something like that either, and I don\u2019t necessarily find the cut very tasteful for something like a wedding either - of course that is just my opinion and your sister is entitled to have her wedding however she likes, however she is not entitled to your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s body nor is it a fancy display piece for her and others to look at no matter how beautiful your fianc\u00e9e might be.", "NTA. Good grief. I would be horribly uncomfortable wearing that all day at a wedding.", "NTA. No one should be made to feel uncomfortable like that. Sounds like your sister is being a bridezilla.

Good for you for sticking up for your fiance.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e has zero obligation to be a bridesmaid in anybody's wedding, and just because she has the body to wear the tiny dress doesn't mean she's comfortable in it. I'm non-binary with a biologically female body. If someone asked me to be a bridesmaid and wear a dress, I would decline because I'm not comfortable in dresses. The bride needs to compromise on the dress or find a different bridesmaid.\n\nEdit: I just looked at the dress. That's ridiculous.  I find it hard to believe all her bridesmaids agreed to that dress.", "NTA- Your girlfriend is uncomfortable wearing the dress. She was honest and polite. Nobody needs to persuade or coerce her to wear something that she is uncomfortable wearing. The dress is adorable; however, I would be uncomfortable wearing this dress. It's similar to the towel wrap I use after I shower.", "NTA. Your sister's bridezilla behaviour, pulling the family card and all that body shaming bullshit, is not on. Your parent's behaviour is also not on. Keep supporting your fiancee exactly as you have; she offered compromises that would make her sufficiently comfortable to attend, and your sister responded with \"me! me! me!!!!\" It's a wedding, not a dictatorship. \n\nHaving looked at the dress, I must ask: why is your sister setting up all of the bridesmaids to exposing their panties for the entire day? Bridesmaids shouldn't have to fear exposing boobs, cooch, or butt.", "NTA. \n\nIt's very simple: your fiancee is a grown woman who has made a choice based on her personal boundaries and you are 100% right to support that decision. \n\nShe has been very reasonable in expressing her boundaries and offering your sister potential solutions. Your sister is TA for not respecting that her bridesmaids are humans and not merely her photo props. Whether or not she thinks the dress would fit well or look good on your fiancee's body is irrelevant - it's NOT HER BODY.\n\nIt is not your job to convince your partner or anyone else to display their body in a manner that makes her uncomfortable. Y W B T A if you bullied her into doing it, so good on you for respecting her decision.", "NTA - even if the dress wasn\u2019t so tiny she has every right to bow out. But that dress is not something many people would be comfortable in. I can\u2019t believe your sister can\u2019t see that. Also, I love how she\u2019s mad, not because she loves your fianc\u00e9e and wants her to participate, but because it \u201cwill look weird\u201d if she isn\u2019t in it. Ugh. She sounds exhausting. Good on you for supporting your fianc\u00e9e!", "I\u2019m a stripper (actually) and I\u2019d still be uncomfortable wearing that at a wedding.\n\nNta", "NTA\n\nYou seem like a supportive partner, and your fianc\u00e9 deserves that. It's 100% her choice if she feels uncomfortable in a dress, and your sister will have to accept a firm \"not for me\" from her future SIL.", "NTA. Being a bridesmaid is a big ask. Your sister is right, she's the bride and she can pick the dress she wants and that's fine. She can't force someone to be a bridesmaid. \n\nShe doesn't have to compromise on the dress and shouldn't have to but then she should respect your fiancee's boundaries. Optics/politics aside, tell her she can't force someone to be a bridesmaid and that's that. Sucks that your family is pressuring you but you will have to stand your ground and your fiancee will be so grateful.", "Well, give your sister credit for not caring if the bridesmaids get more attention that she does.\n\nNTA. I know the bride's maids are supposed to be accommodating and respect the bride's taste, but that dress shows none (I mean taste, obviously). That dress is really cute but not for a wedding. Unless ...\n\nIs your sister getting married by a pool and planning on everyone swimming instead of dancing?", "NTA. Your sister is really being a bridezilla. She didn't account for the comfort of her bridesmaids when choosing this dress. In my view, it is very much on the revealing side for a wedding, and that may be 100% fine with some people but it doesn't strike me as an extreme or unreasonable position for your fiancee to have, especially because she offered a compromise of a layer over it. Your sister is essentially saying 'my way or the highway', and your fiancee has chosen highway. \n\nKeep supporting your fiancee, try to stay positive with your sis and others around the wedding planning, but don't be guilted into complying. If the bride cares SO MUCH that 'her girls' be in her wedding, she can compromise on this or find another dress option.", "It\u2019s cute\u2026but for a wedding? Hard pass. NTA.", "NTA. Also depending on how your fiance is built, there's a lot that could be out on front street in that dress if she were to bend over/dancing and things start riding up\n\nShe's family and the bride, but this ain't a dictatorship.", "NTA and good for you for sticking up for her", "Nta. \n\nIt is not your responsibility to convince someone to be comfortable.  \n\nIt's the bridges' responsibility to compensate.", "NTA.\n\nKeep telling the bridezilla that no means NO. Your fiancee does not want to be a bridesmaid at this point and you will support her.", "NTA. Might be the bride's day. But it's your fianc\u00e9e's body she wants to put in to short dress. She has declined. Bride and family need to understand. No is not negotiable. Time to ask your sister if she wants you to attend.", "People may disagree with me, but I say NTA. I mean, yes, when agree to be in a wedding, you know the bridesmaids dress is ultimately the brides choice, but I\u2019m really tired of all the entitled brides expecting that everyone should be as inconvenienced as possible, because it\u2019s \u201ctheir special day\u201d. And all you able to do is look at this sub every damn day and you will find at least one example. I just don\u2019t understand it. When I got married, I took two people with me (maid of honor and matron of honor) to look at bridesmaids dresses initially. One was a bit curvy body shape with large breasts, the other was very thin with small breasts. The others were all in between. So I wanted to make sure that we could find something that not only was the color that I wanted, BUT it was important to me that it flattered and was comfortable for all body types because I CARE ABOUT THEM. I wanted them to feel good in it, because they were paying for it and had to wear it. That dress is extremely short and while many women are comfortable with that, and that\u2019s great, not everyone is. I would never dream of forcing my friends to wear and pay for something they hate.", "NTA\n\nYour sis is going Bridgeville here. You ask someone to be a bridesmaid; you don't dictate.\n\n Your fianc\u00e9e's reason is very valid and not personal to your sister. It is your sister's right to choose whatever dress for the bridesmaids that she wants ofc. But she should respect your fianc\u00e9e's choice here. If your sister really wants her there, she could change the dress. \n\nYour sister is making a problem out of nothing.", "NTA\n\nPersonally, I would have been prepared to wear the dress when I was your SO\u2019s age - but even 10 years later it would have been a strong \u201cNO\u201d from me. I was too curvy to look good in a similar dress. It\u2019s not the length, or the thigh slip, and I am only a U.K. 10/12 but I have a big bosom and a belly (2 kids does that). \n\nBut if a bridesmaid says \u201cnot wearing that!\u201d And if you aren\u2019t prepared to make any allowance, then you have to accept that the bridesmaid is no longer a bridesmaid. You can\u2019t FORCE someone to wear a dress - they are not your slave!", "NTA. \n\n>I support my fianc\u00e9e and don't want her to be uncomfortable.\n\nThat's what a real relationship looks like.\n\n>she is mad at me too for not convincing my fianc\u00e9e to wear the dress.\n\nYou don't manipulate people you care about.\n\n>My sister is pulling the I'm family and the bride card and has gotten our parents involved and they are on my back over it.\n\nPerhaps they could shout really loud as well.

People saying it\u2019s inappropriate for a wedding, etc, are basing that only off of black tie weddings where everything is super formal. The people getting married determine the vibe of the wedding, not you, not me, not anyone else. If they said show up in jeans and a t-shirt, then you don\u2019t get to be upset because, \u201cWho wears jeans to a wedding.\u201d Just doom scroll wedding subreddits and you\u2019ll see all kinds, formal, informal, pool parties, garden parties, cosplay, etc. Your sister and the other bridesmaids like the dress? Then that\u2019s okay. It isn\u2019t up to us to judge or condemn what they like just because we wouldn\u2019t personally do it. \n\nOn the other side of the coin, however, your fianc\u00e9e is absolutely justified in saying no. If she isn\u2019t comfortable in it, she isn\u2019t comfortable with it and absolutely should not be forced to wear it. If she wants to step down and just be a guest, she absolutely can and should be allowed to.\n\nThat\u2019s the way it works. This isn\u2019t the first wedding post where people had to vote this way because well\u2026the bride and groom determine the wedding, not the guests. If they decided to have a pool party and you get mad because you don\u2019t like wearing a bikini around people, well just don\u2019t go. Don\u2019t go around saying that it\u2019s inappropriate for a wedding like you\u2019re the main authority on them, as some people in the comments are hinting.\n\nSo far your sister hasn\u2019t done anything too egregious. Yes, she\u2019s vented her frustrations and your lack of help, from her point of view, but she hasn\u2019t called off the wedding or spoke out of anyone\u2019s name or done anything to harm you guys. All we can hope is that she\u2019ll get over it, even if she never understands it.\n\nEdit: My own brain made me forget where OP pointed out his sister involved the family, who is now also on their case for no reason. But I didn\u2019t think OP and his fianc\u00e9e were assholes to begin with. But the sister definitely is, just not for the dress specifically. A lot of people pointed out the dress over and over because it isn\u2019t \u201cappropriate\u201d or because they wouldn\u2019t wear it.\n\nEdit 2: Would you guys prefer I edit the post and remove my mistake entirely rather than owning up to it? I know it\u2019s only -2, at the time of writing this edit, but still lol. The stuff about the dress isn\u2019t to OP at all, I even think he understood that, it was about comments getting upset or calling it inappropriate or a wedding being a \u201cformal\u201d event.\n\nEdit 3: Okay, I understand. I made a mistake on the internet and I should be forever condemned. I apologize for my brevity and any perceived assholish behavior. I still stand behind OP and his fianc\u00e9e.

Dont you just love the challenge of great clothing on long torsos?

Anyway, whichever end of the dress fits wrong, NTA.", "I told mine green or blue. They got to pick which color, shade, style\u2026they all ended up with navy blue!

You had your fiance's back against your sister being toxic. A lot of men wouldn't and I think you should get some kudos for that.", "NTA. Why is your sister so invested?
