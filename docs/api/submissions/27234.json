Your reasons are 100% valid as to why he should not make these types of comments around you and your shared child. If he expects his son, and yours, to grow up with a respectful attitude towards women, which will impact how happy he is in his future relationships with women, he needs to take what he says around his child seriously. People take. your. parenting. seriously. please. Children are like sponges. That is not a technical term, but if Hubby would like me to get technical, I am earning my degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and a I can assure you that the developmental tasks that children go through, ages 0-puberty are especially influential, and EVERYTHING he is exposed to counts more than it ever will, for the rest of his life.

If I were dating someone and recognized this, it would be a red flag. \n\nIf he's claiming he's joking around, ask him why he thinks it's funny. The answer probably won't be great and I'm not someone who's going to blanket excuse things because the person says they're jokes.

They\u2019re little sponges, and they hear everything you wish they wouldn\u2019t with double the intensity. Even if he is \u201cjoking\u201d and you know it, your child doesn\u2019t. To them, whatever happens in your home will be normal. So if his dad always \u201cjokes\u201d by making negative comments about other people\u2019s bodies, he will think everyone does that and it\u2019s normal. \n\nAnd even without the concern about your child. He should care at least a bit that he\u2019s making you so uncomfortable. It\u2019s not like these comments are adding anything meaningful to his life.

The difference is that we're 30s and know that kind of behavior isn't appropriate in most contexts. The toddler doesn't and will definitely pick that up.

Not far to bring a child into a situation that the child isn\u2019t a part of!", "NTA. You're in the right to hold that view, and I'd say even commendable in voicing it; but your husband is also not necessarily in the wrong for making what he believes to be jokes. Your concern with your child is a legitimate one. And so is your husband's of not wanting to police language and teaching the kid the difference between jokes and serious conversations.\n\nThere's definitely a way to go too far with it in either direction and you did the right thing by voicing it and letting him know he hasn't hit that sweet spot middle ground of what is and isn't ok to joke about, and to what degree.", "YTA. You can have your own opinions and the right to do what you want, but your husband and any other person on this planet has the right to decide what they do and say. \n\nIt is one thing that you consider it wrong to comment on other people's body and don't do it yourself, but the other people have the right to an oponion and to express that opiniom how they seem fit.

Some bachground first:\n\n1. 42% of Americans are obese.\n2. 37 million Americans are diabetic.\n3. We spend double the percentage of our GDP on healthcare than other OECD countries. Primary reason our diet and being overweight.\n4. Clothes manufacturers a couple of decades ago to make women feel better about buying their clothes changed the sizes on their clothing. At first it was one size down (ex. what used to be labelled as size 6 became size 4), then a few years later as Americans kept on getting fatter, they changed the sizes again. So, women would think snd tell each other I'm not fat, I sm only a size 8, which used to be size 14 before.\n\nSo, you can think you are nice for not 'fat shaming.\" My friends and I put on a few pounds we point it out to one another. Years ago I owned a successful fast growing business that had me outting in s lot of hours. I had put on 15-20 lbs without realizing it. I got together eith close friends I hadnt seen for a while, and one of my friend's first comments was, \"what the fuck dude, your tits are getting bigger than my wife's.\" Exaggeration as I was literally just 20 lbs overweight, but point taken. I hadnt been realizing it because weight creeps up on you.\n\nI see grossly obese people walking around and I always wonder. Do these people not have anyone that cared about them when they put on that first 10, 20, 50 extra pounds and now they are 150 lbs overweight and itvis affecting their health and they are waddling around?\n\nSo, you can all feel so proud of yourselves for not 'fat shaming,' but I will continue to bring up to people hey you putting on a little weight there, and will never tell my child that being 50 or 100 lbs overweight is fine or normal. I dont go around shaming people, but I dont do the opposite either and  pretend that itvis normal or good.", "NAH, What your husband says to you in private is private. We all have crappy thoughts. Let's be real we all body shame in our heads. We are just accurately assessing the health of a person. What you can tell him and your toddler that its rude to say those things to people. The fact that you brought your toddler in the discussion just makes you look wrong  to him.", "NTA for not wanting that verbal behavior in your presence and your kids. But you must understand that if this is his personality and style of humor, it\u2019s still going to go on in his head and outside of your presence - if you demand he change that, then it would make you the AH. \n\nBut simply requesting that he not do it in front of you and the kid?
