So fact of the matter is, it's outdated. No longer used and replaced with another term: Advanced Maternal Age (AMA). \n\nSo, your sister is not correct on the technical term but merely the definition. However her argument is of using the correct term to classify your pregnancy which her outdated medical knowledge failed her in that regard. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/pregnancy-after-35\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/geriatric-pregnancy\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nHow are *you* being the immature one here? Your sister keeps pushing this in your face, all but screaming \"I'M RIGHT, I'M RIGHT, I'M RIGHT!\" She brings it up once, okay, fine. But you made it clear that you didn't like using that term, and she just kept going and going and going, even harassing you with multiple articles. And to what end? To prove that the terminology is correct? Who cares? As long as you and the baby are healthy, that's what matters.", "NTA and it is wild to me that this is the hill your sister is willing to die on. I asked my husband (pediatrician) and my aunt (OB-GYN) and they say that \"geriatric pregnancy\" is not in any shape, way, or form a \"scientifically accurate term.\" That's just the term used to describe pregnancy for women aged 35 and older and it can and HAS been changed in recent years to \"pregnancy at an advanced maternal age.\" They say that the term has long been considered outdated, and is a call-back to a time when having children in your 30s was not the norm. Society's changed, women have children later in life, and despite the difficulties and risks with getting pregnant at an \"advanced maternal age,\" there is no way that the term \"geriatric\" is an accurate way to describe women having children past age 35 (especially since the median age for first-time mothers in most places is 30, if I recall correctly).\n\nDon't apologize, ask her instead to examine why she's so fixated on being unhappy for you.  \n\n\nEdited to add: CONGRATULATIONS!!!", "NTA - Now I think it's the ideal time to temporarily block your mother as well.\n\nIn my country, an actress recently gave birth at the age of 53.

No. \n\nFor the record, my youngest was a geriatric pregnancy, and he's fine. Just listen to your doctor.\n\nI'm curious to what she would have you do differently. Was she trying to get you to abort or something?\n\nNTA", "NTA -The longer you block your sister, the better off you'll be.", "NTA\n\nThis term is only relevant for your medical treatment, it's irrelevant for daily life.

She's not being \"scientifically accurate\" she's hiding behind scientific accuracy as an excuse to be rude to you.\n\nThere's actually a name for what she's doing in online spaces, imo it applies here too, it's called \"Concern trolling.\" Where you pretend to have a genuine worry for someone's health or safety or wellbeing to try and pretend that the insulting, demeaning, and condescending things you say to them are coming from a place of love and concern, and make it out like *you're* the asshole for lashing out at someone who's just worried about you because they care so much.\n\nDon't fall for it, it's bullshit, she's just being an asshole.", "NTA. She's clearly figured out a way to press your buttons. You're right to ignore her.", "NTA. Even though, yes, she is using term correctly, she's doing it specifically to fuck with you. She could talk about your pregnancy, and even your age in this context, without using the word \"geriatric\".

My mother used to try to tell me how a woman/mother/person in my profession should act.  It was gross.  Mother's can act/look/be different people and all be wonderful moms.  Lots of moms swear and it makes us no less mamas.  Furthermore, swearing when defending motherhood is totally justified\n\n\nYour sister is an A H.  Maybe she is jealous.  Maybe she is secretly worried about you.  Whatever it is she is going about it wrong.  You are totally justified in blocking her and focusing on having a low stress pregnancy.  \n\nAlso, not sure where you live but I have lived in several American metropolitan cities and the norm in many areas is for women to wait until their '30's to have kids.  I started in my '20's and was often younger than my mom friends, often by a 10 year gap.", "NTA. May I recommend not unblocking her for a long, long time?", "NTA your sister is being an AH, pure and simple. You nailed it, she was just trying to make you feel bad. Also, unblock her perhaps in a year from now.\n\nPart of being a parent is protecting your family from people trying to harm you. You are essentially protecting your baby from your sister who is trying to harm you and your baby. (Also please make a note here, your mother has shown that she does not care about your well being, and will try to interfere with your decisions about your family -- make sure you start setting up mental defences against her).\n\nSo yes, act like a mother -- do not allow your parents to manipulate you to accept abuse from your sister, that dynamic is history and you can just tell them that access to you and your baby will be limited until they learn to behave like respectable grown-ups.", "NTA. The labor unit I work on uses the teem \"advanced maternal age\" during their documentation. Age is discussed with the woman during her pre-natal visits once to address potential risks and then again if those risks become apparent. \n\nIt's not her job to monitor hour pregnancy, age, or risk factors. She can say \"congrats!\" Or nothing.", "INFO: why is the blocking only temporary? Make it permanent, or at least until she apologizes.", "NTA.. it's an outdated clinical term anyway.

Do remember your hormones make you.. erm, different to normal. My wife had a terrible brain cloud for much of her pregnancy.", "NTA. \n\nIs the term technically correct? I mean... barely? That term is becoming outdated and many providers are using advanced maternal age instead. She's not quite incorrect but it certainly sounds old-fashioned and out of date. \n\nIs that how your sister is using it? No, she's very obviously using it *because she knows it annoys and hurts you* and because she disapproves of you being pregnant at all. And frankly, there's no reason for her to be using the phrase \"geriatric pregnancy\" at a family Easter party at all. She's not your doctor. She's just trying to put you down and just using \"oh well that's the scientifically accurate term!\" to get away with it. That's a dick move, your sister sucks.", "NTA. Lol at a profanity on a holy day, your mom is cute.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister is using a technically correct term but should seriously have just let it go the first time you asked.

Go nta. Your sister is bullying you and your mom is helping.", "NTA *deep breath and sighs*.\n\nThis is actually why we \"woke\" scientists advocate for more inclusion of history, ethics and philosophy in STEM education.  \"Scientifically accurate\" terminology is anything but accurate and needs to be handled with the full knowledge of the history of that term, the biases of the people who promulgated it and the values of the society and culture it originated from.  \"Geriatric pregnancy\" is technically accurate in the same way \"Mental retardation\" or \"hysteria\" is an accurate description of neurologic and social function.  This is why it irks me when people fall back to \"but it's technically correct\" when referring to anything related to terminology because all terminology is a social construct and rooted in the culture of its time.  There is an effort to actively remove that phrase from medical culture along with many other efforts to not pathologize mental illnesses or gender issues or sexual issues or gynecological issues (I'm looking at you \"incompetent cervix\" - something pregnant folks love to hear).\n\nIf your sister wants to talk, give her a history of medical terminology and if she doesn't want to hear it, NTA and tell her to eat glass.", "NTA.

Sounds like maybe she's jealous. Personally, I would NOT unblock her.

It came across as jealous/malicious/etc", "Except that it\u2019s not what it\u2019s called. \u201cGeriatric pregnancy\u201d is outdated, now it\u2019s referred to as \u2018Advanced Maternal Age\u2019 pregnancy. It\u2019s one thing to do something for accuracy\u2019s sake, but something\u2019s telling me sis did it just to be an AH.", "Sure you can. There are various reasons to go LC/NC with your family. Blood doesn't mean they can disrespect you like this. Your sister chose to be right over having a good relationship.

My sister had a baby in her early 40s and we both remarked that it was funny that her OB/GYN called her pregnancy \u201cgeriatric\u201d (yes, we know that\u2019s the correct term) because she\u2019s definitely not old. But other than that one time, I never brought it up again because it\u2019s irrelevant.

In your case, seems clear your sister was trying to put you down about it. \n\nIn this commenter's case, its likely a solid relationship where its acceptable to razz eachother. I'm 36. I know if my husband joked about \"geriatric pregnancy\", i would laugh with it. But if someone was judging my choices to become a mother at my age and putting judgemental \"worry\" on me, like I was being irresponsible, I wouldn't take it well. \n\nKidna like if your best friend calls you \"an idiot\", feels a lot different than if someone at work jokes about you being \"an idiot\".", "I took it with humor, it was the medically correct term after all. And he knows I'm not that sensitive about my age.", "She knew I wasn't saying it in a mean way because we both found the term outdated and funny. Every time she said it would be with finger-quotes and an eye roll.", "It is still a geriatric pregnancy. That is the term used for pregnancy over 35 even if there are no complications", "What if there's an emergency though? It just isn't practical in the long-term.", "That doesn't answer the quetion. Again, how is it loving to annoy your best friend? Specifically about something personal like this?", "Interesting. If my husband jokingly called me an idiot, I would be wroth, but everyone has a different sense of humor. I do wonder how much of that is people legitimately enjoying having playfully mean relationships, and how much is women being told they are buzzkills if they express hurt and so learning to pretend to like it.", "> I think intentions are important here.

I always tell my husband the things I love about him, and he does the same, and it just makes me really happy. But, everyone is different.

My mum just goes a bit ridiculous and I think to myself, not now. Block. \n\nA few days or weeks later (depending on how painful she is being), I unblock her. \n\nMy mum even gets into the habit of leaving voicemails (whilst unblocked and I am cleaning the house)sarcastically saying, DONKEH101! Am I on block again??!\n\nNooooo. But you will be if you don\u2019t behave.", "I had to teach my parents to behave by walking out of their house whenever they started behaving rudely. I remember once I had travelled a hour to their place and left within 2 minutes, as my father started making rude comments about my appearance, so back to my own home I went. After that they learned to behave, but they need a reminder occasionally. I just leave in the middle of whatever I'm doing if they don't behave, works like a charm.\n\nI don't even have to respond to their rude comments, I just leave with a smile on my face. Works so much better than responding."]}
