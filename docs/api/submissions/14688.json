So fact of the matter is, it's outdated. No longer used and replaced with another term: Advanced Maternal Age (AMA). \n\nSo, your sister is not correct on the technical term but merely the definition. However her argument is of using the correct term to classify your pregnancy which her outdated medical knowledge failed her in that regard. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/pregnancy-after-35\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/geriatric-pregnancy\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nHow are *you* being the immature one here? Your sister keeps pushing this in your face, all but screaming \"I'M RIGHT, I'M RIGHT, I'M RIGHT!\" She brings it up once, okay, fine. But you made it clear that you didn't like using that term, and she just kept going and going and going, even harassing you with multiple articles. And to what end? To prove that the terminology is correct? Who cares? As long as you and the baby are healthy, that's what matters.", "NTA and it is wild to me that this is the hill your sister is willing to die on. I asked my husband (pediatrician) and my aunt (OB-GYN) and they say that \"geriatric pregnancy\" is not in any shape, way, or form a \"scientifically accurate term.\" That's just the term used to describe pregnancy for women aged 35 and older and it can and HAS been changed in recent years to \"pregnancy at an advanced maternal age.\" They say that the term has long been considered outdated, and is a call-back to a time when having children in your 30s was not the norm. Society's changed, women have children later in life, and despite the difficulties and risks with getting pregnant at an \"advanced maternal age,\" there is no way that the term \"geriatric\" is an accurate way to describe women having children past age 35 (especially since the median age for first-time mothers in most places is 30, if I recall correctly).\n\nDon't apologize, ask her instead to examine why she's so fixated on being unhappy for you.  \n\n\nEdited to add: CONGRATULATIONS!!!", "NTA - Now I think it's the ideal time to temporarily block your mother as well.\n\nIn my country, an actress recently gave birth at the age of 53.

No. \n\nFor the record, my youngest was a geriatric pregnancy, and he's fine. Just listen to your doctor.\n\nI'm curious to what she would have you do differently. Was she trying to get you to abort or something?\n\nNTA", "NTA -The longer you block your sister, the better off you'll be.", "NTA\n\nThis term is only relevant for your medical treatment, it's irrelevant for daily life.

She's not being \"scientifically accurate\" she's hiding behind scientific accuracy as an excuse to be rude to you.\n\nThere's actually a name for what she's doing in online spaces, imo it applies here too, it's called \"Concern trolling.\" Where you pretend to have a genuine worry for someone's health or safety or wellbeing to try and pretend that the insulting, demeaning, and condescending things you say to them are coming from a place of love and concern, and make it out like *you're* the asshole for lashing out at someone who's just worried about you because they care so much.\n\nDon't fall for it, it's bullshit, she's just being an asshole.", "NTA. She's clearly figured out a way to press your buttons. You're right to ignore her.", "NTA. Even though, yes, she is using term correctly, she's doing it specifically to fuck with you.

My mother used to try to tell me how a woman/mother/person in my profession should act.  It was gross.  Mother's can act/look/be different people and all be wonderful moms.  Lots of moms swear and it makes us no less mamas.  Furthermore, swearing when defending motherhood is totally justified\n\n\nYour sister is an A H.  Maybe she is jealous.  Maybe she is secretly worried about you.  Whatever it is she is going about it wrong.  You are totally justified in blocking her and focusing on having a low stress pregnancy.  \n\nAlso, not sure where you live but I have lived in several American metropolitan cities and the norm in many areas is for women to wait until their '30's to have kids.  I started in my '20's and was often younger than my mom friends, often by a 10 year gap.", "NTA. May I recommend not unblocking her for a long, long time?", "NTA your sister is being an AH, pure and simple. You nailed it, she was just trying to make you feel bad. Also, unblock her perhaps in a year from now.\n\nPart of being a parent is protecting your family from people trying to harm you. You are essentially protecting your baby from your sister who is trying to harm you and your baby. (Also please make a note here, your mother has shown that she does not care about your well being, and will try to interfere with your decisions about your family -- make sure you start setting up mental defences against her).\n\nSo yes, act like a mother -- do not allow your parents to manipulate you to accept abuse from your sister, that dynamic is history and you can just tell them that access to you and your baby will be limited until they learn to behave like respectable grown-ups.", "NTA. The labor unit I work on uses the teem \"advanced maternal age\" during their documentation. Age is discussed with the woman during her pre-natal visits once to address potential risks and then again if those risks become apparent. \n\nIt's not her job to monitor hour pregnancy, age, or risk factors. She can say \"congrats!\" Or nothing.", "INFO: why is the blocking only temporary? Make it permanent, or at least until she apologizes.", "NTA.. it's an outdated clinical term anyway.

Do remember your hormones make you.. erm, different to normal. My wife had a terrible brain cloud for much of her pregnancy.", "NTA. \n\nIs the term technically correct? I mean... barely? That term is becoming outdated and many providers are using advanced maternal age instead. She's not quite incorrect but it certainly sounds old-fashioned and out of date. \n\nIs that how your sister is using it? No, she's very obviously using it *because she knows it annoys and hurts you* and because she disapproves of you being pregnant at all. And frankly, there's no reason for her to be using the phrase \"geriatric pregnancy\" at a family Easter party at all. She's not your doctor. She's just trying to put you down and just using \"oh well that's the scientifically accurate term!\" to get away with it. That's a dick move, your sister sucks.", "NTA. Lol at a profanity on a holy day, your mom is cute.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister is using a technically correct term but should seriously have just let it go the first time you asked.

Go nta. Your sister is bullying you and your mom is helping.", "NTA *deep breath and sighs*.\n\nThis is actually why we \"woke\" scientists advocate for more inclusion of history, ethics and philosophy in STEM education.  \"Scientifically accurate\" terminology is anything but accurate and needs to be handled with the full knowledge of the history of that term, the biases of the people who promulgated it and the values of the society and culture it originated from.  \"Geriatric pregnancy\" is technically accurate in the same way \"Mental retardation\" or \"hysteria\" is an accurate description of neurologic and social function.  This is why it irks me when people fall back to \"but it's technically correct\" when referring to anything related to terminology because all terminology is a social construct and rooted in the culture of its time.  There is an effort to actively remove that phrase from medical culture along with many other efforts to not pathologize mental illnesses or gender issues or sexual issues or gynecological issues (I'm looking at you \"incompetent cervix\" - something pregnant folks love to hear).\n\nIf your sister wants to talk, give her a history of medical terminology and if she doesn't want to hear it, NTA and tell her to eat glass.", "NTA.

Sounds like maybe she's jealous. Personally, I would NOT unblock her.

Whereas, older Fathers have a mixture of good and bad sperm, and so babies that make it to birth and are born with \"genetic deficits\" usually are due to the Father's side, I think it is estimated around 80% contribution from the Father.

OP's point was that \"geriatric pregnancy\" isn't an official scientific term, and the apparent consensus in this discussion has been that it isn't. Again, \"geriatric\" isn't even really accurate unless you believe that age 35 is in any way \"elderly,\" which is what \"geriatric\" means. So with time the terminology evolved to be more accurate. OP's sister is insisting on the old terminology for reasons known only to her, but we can assume that it has something to do with her being unhappy about OP's pregnancy to begin with.", "My point is that of George Carlin.  We take simple terms to define unpleasant things, people get offended, and so we develop longer and longer terms to describe the same thing as each new descriptor falls into disfavor.  Then it apparently becomes so long we change it into an acronym.", "It is objectively true that AMA pregnancies are higher risk than for younger women. However, I think 1. Insistence on using the term \u201cgeriatric\u201d despite OP\u2019s request not to is odd and 2. It\u2019s not like the OP can do anything about it now so why is her sister lecturing her about the risks? Her doctor is aware of them and will monitor her appropriately.", "That's fair, and I'm not advocating the usage, just commenting that I found the mental image funny. Classic cervix, can't get anything right!", "What emergency is going to occur where someone else couldn\u2019t call you? \n\nShe\u2019s a bully and your mom is an enabler. She only knows she\u2019d blocked because she tried to continue harassing you.", "Is your number 911? Did you block her on your parents\u2019 phones as well?   \n   \n No? Then she\u2019ll be fine.", "I am amazed you are still alive. She showed great restraint in not beating you to death with the walker. \ud83e\udd23", "My aunt is pushing 70 though, so maybe it is a preference in terminology? I mean, this all just further proves that there is no official technical term for women getting pregnant past age 35, so OP's sister is wrong either way to insist on it being \"scientifically accurate,\" lol.  \n\n\nEdited to add: Congratulations!!!", "Most subreddits now temporarily block your account from posting if you use the R word.", "Yes it is", "I also think a huge part of this is ya know evolving as you learn things. You literally made my point with shell shock vs PTSD. Or do you think PTSD only applies to those who fought in wars? This may be the dumbest take I\u2019ve saw on Reddit today.\n\nShe claimed it was a scientific term. It\u2019s not \n\nSounds like case closed.", "Right! This cracked me up!!! Geriatric pregnancy is a term that has, in my experience, created some hysterical conversations. I love that someone made it more funny with a walker! This person has an amazing partner with a great sense of humor. Otherwise, like you said, they would cease to exist! \ud83e\udd23", "About 1 week after our first appointment, I was helping my friend clear out his dad's old house (he had recently passed), and sitting right by the front door was his old walker. I asked my friend if I could borrow it. \n\nHe replied with \"it's your funeral.\"\n\nI couldn't help myself. I slept on the couch that night.", "I figured you were referencing Carlin when you mentioned shell-shock, but I wasn't sure. \n\nIn any case, Carlin's whole point was that soft language is deceptive because it doesn't accurately describe the object or problem. That logic doesn't even apply in this case because, as pointed out multiple times, 35 is not \"elderly/geriatric,\" so the language change was to be more accurate, not to be deceptive. \n\nAnd since you brought it up, as beloved as Carlin is/was, his shell-shock example isn't even a great example of his point. \"PTSD\" was not coined to make \"shell-shock\" or \"combat-fatigue\" sound prettier, it was the umbrella term reached to describe phenomena arising out of certain experiences. Someone fighting in the trenches in World War I had shell-shock, a Vietnam veteran who fought in the jungles had combat fatigue but probably not shell shock, but both have PTSD. A better example of his point is the whole \"toilet paper\" vs. \"bathroom tissue\" discussion, but that doesn't apply here.", "Is there a way to only block texts? In an emergency, she should probably call you anyway, but she likely won't bother for small things. I wonder if this is possible", "I feel like this kind of relationship is really common between men, but the rules are always the same: if you can both make the jokes it's fine, if only one person is allowed and the other gets punished for giving back it's a major problem.", "I would have found it funny but at the same time I was so ridiculously sensitive during my pregnancy. I remember wearing a black and white swimsuit at 8 month pregnant and my husband made a shamu comment. I almost killed him then spent an hour crying.

It goes both ways in these relationships so why assume it\u2019s fine for the men but the women are just dealing with it\u2026"]}
