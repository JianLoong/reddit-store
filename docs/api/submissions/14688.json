So fact of the matter is, it's outdated. No longer used and replaced with another term: Advanced Maternal Age (AMA). \n\nSo, your sister is not correct on the modern technical term but merely the definition. However her argument is of using the correct term to classify your pregnancy which her outdated medical knowledge failed her in that regard. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/pregnancy-after-35\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/geriatric-pregnancy\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nHow are *you* being the immature one here? Your sister keeps pushing this in your face, all but screaming \"I'M RIGHT, I'M RIGHT, I'M RIGHT!\" She brings it up once, okay, fine. But you made it clear that you didn't like using that term, and she just kept going and going and going, even harassing you with multiple articles. And to what end? To prove that the terminology is correct? Who cares? As long as you and the baby are healthy, that's what matters.", "NTA and it is wild to me that this is the hill your sister is willing to die on. I asked my husband (pediatrician) and my aunt (OB-GYN) and they say that \"geriatric pregnancy\" is not in any shape, way, or form a \"scientifically accurate term.\" That's just the term used to describe pregnancy for women aged 35 and older and it can and HAS been changed in recent years to \"pregnancy at an advanced maternal age.\" They say that the term has long been considered outdated, and is a call-back to a time when having children in your 30s was not the norm. Society's changed, women have children later in life, and despite the difficulties and risks with getting pregnant at an \"advanced maternal age,\" there is no way that the term \"geriatric\" is an accurate way to describe women having children past age 35 (especially since the median age for first-time mothers in most places is 30, if I recall correctly).\n\nDon't apologize, ask her instead to examine why she's so fixated on being unhappy for you.  \n\n\nEdited to add: CONGRATULATIONS!!!", "NTA - Now I think it's the ideal time to temporarily block your mother as well.\n\nIn my country, an actress recently gave birth at the age of 53.

No. \n\nFor the record, my youngest was a geriatric pregnancy, and he's fine. Just listen to your doctor.\n\nI'm curious to what she would have you do differently. Was she trying to get you to abort or something?\n\nNTA", "NTA -The longer you block your sister, the better off you'll be.", "NTA\n\nThis term is only relevant for your medical treatment, it's irrelevant for daily life. People who insist on being \"accurate\" when it's completely irrelevant just so they can put people down or get a rise out of them are assholes.", "NTA. She's not being \"scientifically accurate\" she's hiding behind scientific accuracy as an excuse to be rude to you.\n\nThere's actually a name for what she's doing in online spaces, imo it applies here too, it's called \"Concern trolling.\" Where you pretend to have a genuine worry for someone's health or safety or wellbeing to try and pretend that the insulting, demeaning, and condescending things you say to them are coming from a place of love and concern, and make it out like *you're* the asshole for lashing out at someone who's just worried about you because they care so much.\n\nDon't fall for it, it's bullshit, she's just being an asshole.", "NTA. She's clearly figured out a way to press your buttons. You're right to ignore her.", "NTA. Even though, yes, she is using term correctly, she's doing it specifically to fuck with you.

Your sister is vile.", "NTA\n\nIt used to be \"scientifically accurate\" to treat depression in women with a vibrator.\n\nScience is a constantly evolving process, and sometimes it doesn't right itself fast enough. \n\nThe word \"geriatric\" means \"something something old people.\"\n\nShe wouldn't be using the term geriatric to refer to anything else involving a 35 to 39 year old, so using it specifically about your pregnancy is gross, not just as a way to troll you, but also as a way to say women should be having babies in their teens and twenties, which, historically, is how to keep women from having careers and agency over their own life direction.\n\nShe's playing into that culture, and no matter her reasoning, it makes her an asshole.\n\nYour mom is no better, playing in to theocratic, puritanical linguistic prescriptionism.", "You Mom needs to tell your sister to grow up and stop bullying you. \nYou\u2019re NTA at all, but your sister certainly is.

Obviously this is something you are happy with. You should also let your mother know, some mothers swear. \u201c Acting\u201d like a mother? Maybe your mother should be more worried about why one of her children would be so dead set saying hurtful things to her other child.", "NTA - A little ribbing is one thing if you didn't mind (I was \"advanced maternal age\" myself and rolled my eyes every time I heard it), but sending articles after you set the boundary isn't okay.", "NTA\n\n\nAnd how dare your mother try to tell you how a mother has to act?  My mother used to try to tell me how a woman/mother/person in my profession should act.  It was gross.  Mother's can act/look/be different people and all be wonderful moms.  Lots of moms swear and it makes us no less mamas.  Furthermore, swearing when defending motherhood is totally justified\n\n\nYour sister is an A H.  Maybe she is jealous.  Maybe she is secretly worried about you.  Whatever it is she is going about it wrong.  You are totally justified in blocking her and focusing on having a low stress pregnancy.  \n\nAlso, not sure where you live but I have lived in several American metropolitan cities and the norm in many areas is for women to wait until their '30's to have kids.  I started in my '20's and was often younger than my mom friends, often by a 10 year gap.", "NTA. May I recommend not unblocking her for a long, long time?", "NTA your sister is being an AH, pure and simple. You nailed it, she was just trying to make you feel bad. Also, unblock her perhaps in a year from now.\n\nPart of being a parent is protecting your family from people trying to harm you. You are essentially protecting your baby from your sister who is trying to harm you and your baby. (Also please make a note here, your mother has shown that she does not care about your well being, and will try to interfere with your decisions about your family -- make sure you start setting up mental defences against her).\n\nSo yes, act like a mother -- do not allow your parents to manipulate you to accept abuse from your sister, that dynamic is history and you can just tell them that access to you and your baby will be limited until they learn to behave like respectable grown-ups.", "NTA. The labor unit I work on uses the teem \"advanced maternal age\" during their documentation. Age is discussed with the woman during her pre-natal visits once to address potential risks and then again if those risks become apparent. \n\nIt's not her job to monitor hour pregnancy, age, or risk factors. She can say \"congrats!\" Or nothing.", "INFO: why is the blocking only temporary? Make it permanent, or at least until she apologizes.", "NTA.. it's an outdated clinical term anyway.

Do remember your hormones make you.. erm, different to normal. My wife had a terrible brain cloud for much of her pregnancy.", "NTA. \n\nIs the term technically correct? I mean... barely? That term is becoming outdated and many providers are using advanced maternal age instead. She's not quite incorrect but it certainly sounds old-fashioned and out of date. \n\nIs that how your sister is using it? No, she's very obviously using it *because she knows it annoys and hurts you* and because she disapproves of you being pregnant at all. And frankly, there's no reason for her to be using the phrase \"geriatric pregnancy\" at a family Easter party at all. She's not your doctor. She's just trying to put you down and just using \"oh well that's the scientifically accurate term!\" to get away with it. That's a dick move, your sister sucks.", "NTA. Lol at a profanity on a holy day, your mom is cute.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister is using a technically correct term but should seriously have just let it go the first time you asked.

Go nta. Your sister is bullying you and your mom is helping.", "NTA *deep breath and sighs*.\n\nThis is actually why we \"woke\" scientists advocate for more inclusion of history, ethics and philosophy in STEM education.  \"Scientifically accurate\" terminology is anything but accurate and needs to be handled with the full knowledge of the history of that term, the biases of the people who promulgated it and the values of the society and culture it originated from.  \"Geriatric pregnancy\" is technically accurate in the same way \"Mental retardation\" or \"hysteria\" is an accurate description of neurologic and social function.  This is why it irks me when people fall back to \"but it's technically correct\" when referring to anything related to terminology because all terminology is a social construct and rooted in the culture of its time.  There is an effort to actively remove that phrase from medical culture along with many other efforts to not pathologize mental illnesses or gender issues or sexual issues or gynecological issues (I'm looking at you \"incompetent cervix\" - something pregnant folks love to hear).\n\nIf your sister wants to talk, give her a history of medical terminology and if she doesn't want to hear it, NTA and tell her to eat glass.", "NTA.

Sounds like maybe she's jealous. Personally, I would NOT unblock her.

Whereas, older Fathers have a mixture of good and bad sperm, and so babies that make it to birth and are born with \"genetic deficits\" usually are due to the Father's side, I think it is estimated around 80% contribution from the Father.

I mean... I GUESS it's okay, but you ARE 40...\"\n\nAnd she had so much stress during that pregnancy because of that doctor, and she'd come into work from dr. appts. in tears that she was \"too old to have this baby.\"  And I said, \"Listen - can you just see the one doctor?  Why even give this clown the time of day?\"  And I pointed out that - since I am an older friend to her, she's 43 and I'm almost 60 - that the old \"you can't have a baby after 35\" is outdated and archaic.

Don't listen to it.\"  I also reminded her that she was over 35 when she had her daughter, who is a perfectly happy and healthy child, as is her son, who she had at 40.\n\nSometimes you just have to ignore the idiots, OP, and it sounds like your sister is one of them.

Now it depends who you talk to if it\u2019s 35 or 40 and over, and it\u2019s \u201cadvanced maternal age\u201d for most practitioners who have changed their language (I\u2019m a midwife).\n\nDon\u2019t see why it\u2019s any of OP\u2019s sister\u2019s business anyways!", "Yeah, they call it advanced maternal age now, but it\u2019s horse crap anyway.  I got pregnant not only naturally, but on accident and had my first child at age 42.", "Ultrasound tech here, I second this! It's advanced maternal age where I am, or sometimes mature maternal age. We don't use geriatric pregnancy. Op you are NTA", "Even if it was still the medically accurate term, there would be no excuse for using it with a person whom you know dislikes it.  I have a couple of former friends who are former because they nagged like this.   You didn't say how old your sister is, but I suspect that she's too old to be running to your mother to tattle, and you should just ignore Mom on this point.", "The sister sounds really abusive and mean, I would ignore her until she apologizes. It's not your fault if she'd rather abuse you than be an Aunt. She can't do both. NTA", "I seriously hope this becomes the to comment. Science is super important but has been the purview of too small of a slice of humanity (mostly rich, mostly white, mostly male) for way too long. We are still dealing with the fallout of that, and science is poorer as a result. I\u2019m so glad we are (slowly, oh too slowly) doing better.\n\nAnd cripes, your mom can F right off too. So it was a holy day. Your sister wasn\u2019t being very <anything even vaguely religious> with that term.\n\nAs you said, she just wasn\u2019t being kind. Her preferred religious icon would likely take a dim view\n\nPart of being a parent is standing up for your kids when needed, ESPECIALLY when it is family. You\u2019re already on track to be a great mom. \ud83d\ude01\n\nAnd congratulations!!", "As a first time pregnant woman the term \u2018incompetent cervix\u2019 actually sent me on a stress spiral for days when I heard it. I literally felt guilt just at the thought.", "Outdated but still used unfortunately", "She's 29?!!! She's acting like an disgruntled child who insists that they get their way, damn every one else.", "so is your sister the golden child or does she just usually get away with being an asshole because your mother wants to keep the peace at all cost? I\u2019m literally infuriated at how little support and consideration your family is showing for you.", "Ditto. I turned 35 while pregnant with my second and my doctor was absolutely thrilled to tell me that it was a geriatric pregnancy. I always thought there must be a better term...", "About 20 years ago, a friend of mine got pregnant at 41 and was it was labeled \"geriatric\" by her doctor. Be on the lookout for your doctor to categorize anything and everything going wrong as being caused by this geriatric status. That doctor shrugged off EVERY complication that way; it was insulting and potentially dangerous.", "Could be, wouldn\u2019t bother me if my doc referred to my pregnancy like that. But why is the sister insisting on repeating the term over and over knowing it hurts OPs feelings? She just seems really mean.\n\nNTA, just continue to ignore her, what a negative pill.", "You're both right.   There's been a big push to use Advanced Maternal Age since 'geriatric' is both inaccurate, and pretty offensive, but some people in the birth world are still stuck in the 50s. (If an OB  or nurse I was working with still said \"geriatric\", I'd worry about what other outdated practices they were using!)", "\nA 35 year old from a couple hundred years ago looked way different than a 35 year old does today for sure. I mean, Shakira is 46 and she looks 2 decades younger.", "I may be wrong about this, but I don't think I am since I am a woman who has gone through menopause.  But unless there's a real health issue, you can still have a baby up till menopause when the body KNOWS it's time to shut down the baby-making works, am I right?  I'm not a doctor, but yeah, I used birth control till I was through with menopause, and that meant even in my 40s - because I didn't hit menopause till I was 50.  Which means if you can still get pregnant, then you're not \"too old\" to have a baby.", "I understand that but she's already 5 months pregnant, so I'm asking what difference it makes at this point. The sister kept saying she was \"concerned\" about it. Okay, she's concerned. So what? It's like debating the proper name of the airplane you're in, in the middle of the trip.", "Dude one of the ways to whip me into a passionate rant is to claim teenage pregnancy is the \"ideal age\" for childbirth when it's quite the opposite and those pregnancy are actually very high risk and have worse outcomes on how the child is raised too. Also like you said the average marrying age for non royals was early 20s, because you needed money and resources even as a woman to get married. Plus with periods occurring later in life on average than they do now it wasn't uncommon for a lot of teenagers to not be even age to have kids yet. The really young marriages we hear about are the royal ones that were used to secure treaties and even in those everyone didn't expect the marriage to be consummated until all parties were of age.", "Thank you!! In a medical setting it makes sense to discuss it, but at the table during Easter? I've slept on it and I still have no idea what OP's sister wanted to achieve.", "LOL, you're right, not better.", "That will piss them off. Go nta. Your sister is bullying you and your mom is helping.", "She said it\u2019s because more women are having them later and therefore they have more research on women having babies in their 30s than they once did. I\u2019m not sure why you think that\u2019s bad. I\u2019m not a doctor, just relaying information I was told. Relax.", "Exactly like they didn't want the woman to immediately die in her first pregnancy during child birth because she was 14 and too small. The whole point was to keep the alliance AND get royal hires.", "Thank you Dear", "This exactly! I called it the \"baby? Or beer?\" phase and it was awful, both times."]}
