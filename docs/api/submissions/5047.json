At most, he should have slipped out, eaten, and returned quietly. Letting it be known and eating at the reception is a VERY AH move. You were rude, disrespectful and trashy. Apologize and teach your son better. Also he's 22. Ummm, enable much?", "YTA for having the smelly fast food brought in. The reception food was expensive (most likely) and provided to you for free. Your son leaves for other food\u2026fine. But to bring that shitty food back to the reception would be seen as tacky and insulting. \n\nBtw, I\u2019m a picky eater and my son is as well\u2026the challenge is to go about it tactfully.", "Hard YTA.\n\nYour son is 22. He can eat before the ceremony, or eat after. Or eat a granola bar in the bathroom. \n\nBut instead you and him made a big enough scene of the food not being to his liking that many people knew, and then he proceeded to bring back dinner for several other people, causing an even bigger scene that was highly disruptive of an insanely expensive formal dinner *that you nor any of the other guests getting take out paid for*. \n\nI assume that the wedding allowed children at the dinner, but it's unclear why you weren't sat at the kids table and supervised by the grown-ups.", "YTA for sure, you should have arranged something beforehand instead of doing it like this. \n\nOh, and stop enabling your adult son, he is 22 ffs.", "YTA - If little \u201cJohnny\u201d is a fussy Eater then he should have stayed at home. I doubt that in a wedding buffet that there was nothing at all that he liked.   \nIt is extremely rude and disrespectful considering how much weddings cost. If he is fussy then he should have eaten before he came", "You \u201clet\u201d your grown human son go get food? First off, why is your 22 year old son requiring your permission to do something as tacky and stupid as this? Second off, your cousin spent good money to provide a reception for guests at their wedding. Assuming your son is indeed a picky eater, the appropriate thing to do would be to find something he liked at the buffet, then stop at a restaurant after the event had ended. \n\nYTA, as well as your son and anyone else that did this. I\u2019m not the most formal manners dude in the world but I\u2019d never do this.", "YTA. It doesn't matter who did or didn't have a problem with it. That's incredibly rude and most likely broke a health code. He's 22, not 2. He can either eat beforehand since he knew he wouldn't like the food, or he can wait til after. Or, here's a crazy thought: he can try new things and just *eat what is served*", "YTA. If he was 2 maybe that would be fine but you raised an adult you can't have manners and etiquette. It's fine he didn't want other food but dang eat it in the car.", "YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't even acknowledge in your own what's the problem here and seeks validation through reddit. It's common courtesy to eat what was served at the event for they spent months preparing and planning for that wedding. If you're going to pull such stunt, you should have not attend the wedding or left your son at home.", "Did bride and groom care about the outside food? \nDid you give a good enough gift to atleast cover his meal? \nDid they get charged extra for bring in outside food?  \n\nHe is 22. You have to teach him to grow up and be an adult.  He can eat different stuff for one evening and it will not kill him. If he can't act like an adult he should have eaten before he got there or left to eat.  You are raising an entitled brat.", "YTA and so rude! at 22 years old he needs to just suck it up and eat what is served, or if he seriously hates it that much, wait until it\u2019s over and go get something then. and you mentioned this was at a restaurant. you can\u2019t bring fast food into a damn restaurant. i wouldn\u2019t be too thrilled if i was the bride in this situation", "He's 22 for fuck's sake, so I'm not sure about the \"let him\" phrasing, but YTA, and so is he, for thinking that this was an appropriate thing to do. Surely, he could have waited a couple of hours to have his precious chickie nuggies?", "It's fast food. It's not a meal one lingers over for hours, it's a meal that one scarfs down in a couple minutes. He should have discreetly slipped out of the events, eaten his fast food off-site, and slipped back in without anyone being the wiser.\n\nThe bride and groom may not have minded him eating fast food, but they very much minded him bringing the food back to their reception (at a restaurant no less!), and passing it out to their guests. That's insulting behavior, and it also probably got them in trouble with the restaurant and possibly charged a penalty fee. The business could have gotten a health code violation citation over it, so they would absolutely have emphasized in the contract that no outside food can be brought in.", "YTA your son is so immature he can't eat anything but fast food at a wedding?? And he had to ask his mom? His manners are as appalling as yours.", "YTA. He\u2019s an adult he can go a few hours without eating, I highly doubt there wasn\u2019t a single item at the buffet he couldn\u2019t have eaten, very disrespect AH move to do this. He could have at least not told other people he was going to get other food and then just eaten it out so no one knew.", "YTA. How crass.", "YTA. Your son is 22! If he didn\u2019t like any of the food he should have just sucked it up and got some food on the way home. This was rather disrespectful to the bride and groom and venue.", "YTA\n\n\u201cJohnny\u201d can grow up.", "YTA..... Why on earth did you think it was acceptable did him to bring fast food back to the wedding? Why didn't he eat it at the fast food place?!", "YTA because 1) you used the word \u201clet\u201d for something your adult son was perfectly capable of handling himself and 2) thinking it\u2019s okay to bring fast food into a catered wedding  reception. That is unbelievably rude and tacky.\n\nMy son is an extremely picky eater also, but we are already working on situations where food is served and there aren\u2019t a lot of options. He understands this and makes due when needed. He is 6.", "The lack of self-awareness from both you and your son is pretty impressive. \n\nYTA and so is he.", "YTA \nYou don\u2019t bring your own food to a wedding! \n\nHe could have left, ate, and then returned. Wow! He is 22 time to cut the cord! A picky eater! This is hilarious!", "YTA. I think that was incredibly rude. \n\nYour son is 22 but still eating like a picky child. He has to either a) learn to introduce new foods onto his diet so he can cope with social occasions or b) learn to manage his situation by eating before/after social occasions.\n\nSome people have emotional/mental challenges with food. If that is the case (rather than him just being picky) you should try to support your son. There are therapists who specialise in this.", "YTA.\n\nHe could have eaten in the car. So rude to the bride and groom, and whomever paid for his plate.", "YTA\n\nOf course they were appalled. I\u2019m stunned anyone in your family thought this was a good idea. Shocking behaviour displaying a real lack of common decency and social etiquette.", "YTA for being such an indulgent and negligent parent that you didn't even teach your own son basic manners. You honestly think any of this is okay behavior?  Wow.\n\n\"and you could probably smell it there\"\n\nTacky, crass and deeply insulting behavior. I am also appalled.", "YTA, and your son is a rude, entitled child. A 4 year old with severe dietary restrictions would be a different story. Your son is 22 YEARS old, and should be able to function in society for a few hours. Stop it.", "I am a picky eater due to an autoimmune disease. Certain things make me feel very sick, and I am sensitive to textures/tastes/smells at times. I am all too familiar with the feeling of \"I can't eat this\". \n\nIn the event that I get that feeling, I usually eat a meal before I go to a place I know has food options I can't eat. Or, if I have to leave, I do so discretely, eat fast, then come back. Making a big show about it is super disrespectful in my opinion, and I never want people to feel bad or offended if I can't eat what they offer. People can be VERY sensitive about food. It looks rude as hell when a couple literally pays money for catering options just to have their guests parade other food options. It says \"the food you picked sucks, this is better\" even if you didn't mean to say that.\n\nYou and your son owe the bride and groom an apology. I hope you refused the option to have them purchase a plate for your son, but I can bet the other people that wanted him to bring them back food wasted the bride and groom's money. YTA. You can be a respectful picky eater.", "YTA \u201cLetting\u201d your son? He\u2019s a grown as adult! Why did he feel he had to ask his mommy? Let him make his own crappy decisions.", "If you're son was 4 okay, let him bring his chicken nuggies to a wedding.  However, 22 years old and you're still wiping your adult child's backside and treating him like a toddler, YTA.", "Info: Is your son neurodivergent?\n\nDo you know if the venue had a policy about bringing in outside food? Most do.", "yta\n\ni ll be honest, picky eater is a subject i dont want to go into because it usually gets heated. however, i dont think there is something necessarily wrong with having gotten his own food *IIIFFFFFF* he had kept it to himself. he didnt and even had brought food back which is super disrespectful.", "YTA\n\nSending him for food wasn\u2019t an issue but having him eat it during the reception was a total A H move. He should have eaten in his car.", "INFO: Does your son have any kind of disability or is neurodivergent?", "INFO: is your child 22 years old and male (22Male) or 22 months old (22Months)?", "Ugh\u2026 for a 22 year old? YTA. He\u2019s an enabled child.", "22 years old and in a buffet your adult \"child \"couldnt find anything they could eat .... really ... you enabled this behaviour.... he just wanted fast/junk food .... you have raised a kid who is addicted to junk food and like any junkie he knows how to play you .... trust me if he had nothing else to eat ... he would eat from the buffet  .... fast food is NOT real food if he is so picky that he only eats fast food which it seems you encouraged/enabled he will probably die before you", "YTA\n\nI am very neurodivergent and somewhat of a picky eater. I also have food allergies. And I would never do something like this - if I did I would PLAN IT BEFORE HAND WITH THE BRIDE AND GROOM. that and why tf would you bring food back for others? That's just plain rude even I know that.\n\n\nAlso stop babying him he's a full grown human not a literal child, no matter if he's neurotypical or neurodivergent. Treat him like one.", "YTA - It\u2019s never okay to bring in outside food to a place unless that place has a policy that allows for outside food. I would be appalled as well. Your son is 22 he can eat what is served, leave for a little bit and eat the fast food at the fast food restaurant, eat before, or eat after. Bringing in outside food is not an option.", "22 lmao", "YTA\n\nYou and your son have no manners.", "What do you mean, you \u201clet\u201d your adult son get fast food? He does whatever he needs to do - and answers for himself. If anyone has a problem, refer them to him.", "EDIT: OP has said in a comment that the son in question is not ND. So, my judgement is YTA. Even prior to knowing that, this was already rude and poorly handled- as I state in my comment and as others have said, if OP's son was ND and needed different food, he should have eaten it elsewhere. Bringing stuff for other people is just flat-out unacceptable, 100%. \n\nBefore I decide, gonna echo the question I see a lot below- is there a reason your son is a picky eater?\n\nWhile I do agree that it was rude- he should have eaten it elsewhere, I feel like a lot of people underestimate or flat-out do not understand just how severe sensitivity to foods can be in neurodivergent people. For those of us who don't have those sensitivities, it looks like picky eating and comes across as just being \"immature\" or \"trying to be rude\" or \"entitled\". But for people with those sensitivities, it's PAINFUL to encounter a stimulus, like taste, that they can't handle.\n\nI can't speak for food, but as someone with ADHD I get overstimulated REALLY easily by certain things. It's not just an annoyance- my entire body and brain goes into fight or flight. I can't focus on anything else when I get overstimulated. It is physically uncomfortable, sometimes unbearable, depending on how bad it is. So if your son is, like me and other ND people, super sensitive to certain things? You should have handled it better and probably asked him to eat it outside, but he needed that accommodation.\n\nNow. Him bringing things back for OTHER people to eat, just because? Hell no. That is 100% rude as fuck and that is an AH move.", "YTA.\n\nYour kid knows he's a picky eater. He's 22; this can't be the first time he hasn't liked a catered meal. He can eat before he goes or stay at the fast food place and finish off a burger in 10 minutes. He doesn't need to bring fast food back to a venue that may have a no outside food policy and hand out burgers and nuggets in front of people while probably paid $100 a plate or more for that meal.", "YTA. Bringing in outside food to a wedding is incredibly trashy and rude. He\u2019s a 22 year old, not 2 lmao", "YTA. That\u2019s tacky as hell. He could have easily gone to get food and eaten it in the car. He also shouldn\u2019t have gotten other people food or brought ANY of it inside.", "YTA. Your son is 22, not 2.

Could have waited until after", "YTA He is 22, he should either eat beforehand or after, or quickly nip out to his car and eat something he left there in tupperware. It is very rude to bring fast food into a wedding reception. You shouldn't enable this, it is beyond rude. A wedding and a catered event. The caterers would be very annoyed and the venue.  You shouldn't be enabling this. You need your son to grow up and show more respect. You now have the reputation of being the 'trashy' side of the family.", "YTA he\u2019s 22.

Your son should have excused himself and eaten outside of the venue. This was undoubtedly offensive to the bride and groom, and whomever chose the entrees for the reception.", "I was expecting this to be about a literal child not a 22 year old man. Good grief. This was tacky AF and of course YTA.

If he had just gotten it for himself and no one else I don\u2019t the he would be an asshole, however, I can also understand that they most likely spent a lot of money on the food. I work in a restaurant and getting an event catered(especially a wedding) costs hundreds if not thousands of dollars, so I can see why the bride was upset about multiple people eating fast food instead.", "If the groom and bride don\u2019t care I\u2019ll say NTA, but I also think you are being intentionally oblivious to social cues. Even people with dietary restrictions don\u2019t bring their own food to a wedding, you can endure 4 hrs without eating or you can leave early and then eat.", "Info: is there any reason why he is a picky eater?", "N T A for getting food but YTA and so is he for bringing it back to the reception.

Anybody who doesn\u2019t know this would just assume he\u2019s picky and he doesn\u2019t owe anyone his medical history, particularly since this disorder is so misrepresented in media to the point people are completely ignorant about it and then watch him to see if he\u2019ll do something \u201cfunny\u201d or don\u2019t realize or understand that it causes other \u201cunseen\u201d issues. If I have an opportunity to step away and get him food I\u2019m taking it and I don\u2019t care if it offends others, I\u2019m not making him go hungry so somebody can feel fuzzy about the incredible food they offered.

And BE DISCREET. He took orders? WTF.", "Yes- which is exactly what I suggested. He should have eaten it outside, or elsewhere. As I said, this could have been handled better.", "Right? Eat your McDonald\u2019s when you are out smoking weed at your car like a normal person.", "That's what makes it aggressive. If for some reason the food just isn't doable and you have to go get something else, ok ugh fine.\n\nBut making enough of a thing about it and rallying others to place orders is a big outstretched middle finger.

Like I know some people with allergies can be entitled jerks but when it's actually a serious problem, people tend to actually form coping mechanisms like bringing a damn snack.", "Same!

OP would probably have actually used that as an evidence to support them though.", "nah, that would make the situation be that they've had like 20 years of practice for these sorts of things and should be prepared.", "OP replied to say he is not neurodivergent. He bought a full meal for himself and snacks for everyone else he told about the McDonalds trip.", "Yes, we agree...", "When I saw the title I first assumed it was a little kid, nope, 22 year old dude, OP should know better. And then the fact he got other people food too instead of himself, and they see nothing wrong with that?? OP YTA.", "I once went to a wedding that had meat in literally everything except the dinner rolls. I\u2019m vegetarian. No salad, and the veggies that were offered were cooked in chicken broth or served with ham hock. I waited until I left and took myself out to a delicious Thai dinner on my way back to the hotel.
