At most, he should have slipped out, eaten, and returned quietly. Letting it be known and eating at the reception is a VERY AH move. You were rude, disrespectful and trashy.

Your son leaves for other food\u2026fine. But to bring that shitty food back to the reception would be seen as tacky and insulting. \n\nBtw, I\u2019m a picky eater and my son is as well\u2026the challenge is to go about it tactfully.", "Hard YTA.\n\nYour son is 22. He can eat before the ceremony, or eat after. Or eat a granola bar in the bathroom. \n\nBut instead you and him made a big enough scene of the food not being to his liking that many people knew, and then he proceeded to bring back dinner for several other people, causing an even bigger scene that was highly disruptive of an insanely expensive formal dinner *that you nor any of the other guests getting take out paid for*. \n\nI assume that the wedding allowed children at the dinner, but it's unclear why you weren't sat at the kids table and supervised by the grown-ups.", "YTA for sure, you should have arranged something beforehand instead of doing it like this. \n\nOh, and stop enabling your adult son, he is 22 ffs.", "YTA - If little \u201cJohnny\u201d is a fussy Eater then he should have stayed at home. I doubt that in a wedding buffet that there was nothing at all that he liked.   \nIt is extremely rude and disrespectful considering how much weddings cost. If he is fussy then he should have eaten before he came", "You \u201clet\u201d your grown human son go get food? First off, why is your 22 year old son requiring your permission to do something as tacky and stupid as this? Second off, your cousin spent good money to provide a reception for guests at their wedding. Assuming your son is indeed a picky eater, the appropriate thing to do would be to find something he liked at the buffet, then stop at a restaurant after the event had ended. \n\nYTA, as well as your son and anyone else that did this. I\u2019m not the most formal manners dude in the world but I\u2019d never do this.", "YTA. It doesn't matter who did or didn't have a problem with it. That's incredibly rude and most likely broke a health code. He's 22, not 2. He can either eat beforehand since he knew he wouldn't like the food, or he can wait til after. Or, here's a crazy thought: he can try new things and just *eat what is served*", "YTA. If he was 2 maybe that would be fine but you raised an adult you can't have manners and etiquette. It's fine he didn't want other food but dang eat it in the car.", "YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't even acknowledge in your own what's the problem here and seeks validation through reddit. It's common courtesy to eat what was served at the event for they spent months preparing and planning for that wedding.

You have to teach him to grow up and be an adult.  He can eat different stuff for one evening and it will not kill him. If he can't act like an adult he should have eaten before he got there or left to eat.  You are raising an entitled brat.", "YTA and so rude! at 22 years old he needs to just suck it up and eat what is served, or if he seriously hates it that much, wait until it\u2019s over and go get something then. and you mentioned this was at a restaurant. you can\u2019t bring fast food into a damn restaurant. i wouldn\u2019t be too thrilled if i was the bride in this situation", "He's 22 for fuck's sake, so I'm not sure about the \"let him\" phrasing, but YTA, and so is he, for thinking that this was an appropriate thing to do. Surely, he could have waited a couple of hours to have his precious chickie nuggies?", "YTA. It's fast food. It's not a meal one lingers over for hours, it's a meal that one scarfs down in a couple minutes. He should have discreetly slipped out of the events, eaten his fast food off-site, and slipped back in without anyone being the wiser.\n\nThe bride and groom may not have minded him eating fast food, but they very much minded him bringing the food back to their reception (at a restaurant no less!), and passing it out to their guests. That's insulting behavior, and it also probably got them in trouble with the restaurant and possibly charged a penalty fee. The business could have gotten a health code violation citation over it, so they would absolutely have emphasized in the contract that no outside food can be brought in.\n\nEdit: added a verdict", "YTA your son is so immature he can't eat anything but fast food at a wedding?? And he had to ask his mom? His manners are as appalling as yours.", "YTA. He\u2019s an adult he can go a few hours without eating, I highly doubt there wasn\u2019t a single item at the buffet he couldn\u2019t have eaten, very disrespect AH move to do this. He could have at least not told other people he was going to get other food and then just eaten it out so no one knew.", "YTA. How crass.", "YTA. Your son is 22! If he didn\u2019t like any of the food he should have just sucked it up and got some food on the way home.

Why on earth did you think it was acceptable did him to bring fast food back to the wedding? Why didn't he eat it at the fast food place?!", "YTA because 1) you used the word \u201clet\u201d for something your adult son was perfectly capable of handling himself and 2) thinking it\u2019s okay to bring fast food into a catered wedding  reception. That is unbelievably rude and tacky.\n\nMy son is an extremely picky eater also, but we are already working on situations where food is served and there aren\u2019t a lot of options. He understands this and makes due when needed. He is 6.", "The lack of self-awareness from both you and your son is pretty impressive. \n\nYTA and so is he.", "YTA \nYou don\u2019t bring your own food to a wedding! \n\nHe could have left, ate, and then returned. Wow! He is 22 time to cut the cord! A picky eater! This is hilarious!", "YTA. I think that was incredibly rude. \n\nYour son is 22 but still eating like a picky child. He has to either a) learn to introduce new foods onto his diet so he can cope with social occasions or b) learn to manage his situation by eating before/after social occasions.\n\nSome people have emotional/mental challenges with food. If that is the case (rather than him just being picky) you should try to support your son. There are therapists who specialise in this.", "YTA.\n\nHe could have eaten in the car. So rude to the bride and groom, and whomever paid for his plate.", "YTA\n\nOf course they were appalled. I\u2019m stunned anyone in your family thought this was a good idea. Shocking behaviour displaying a real lack of common decency and social etiquette.", "YTA for being such an indulgent and negligent parent that you didn't even teach your own son basic manners. You honestly think any of this is okay behavior?  Wow.\n\n\"and you could probably smell it there\"\n\nTacky, crass and deeply insulting behavior. I am also appalled.", "YTA, and your son is a rude, entitled child. A 4 year old with severe dietary restrictions would be a different story. Your son is 22 YEARS old, and should be able to function in society for a few hours. Stop it.", "I am a picky eater due to an autoimmune disease. Certain things make me feel very sick, and I am sensitive to textures/tastes/smells at times. I am all too familiar with the feeling of \"I can't eat this\". \n\nIn the event that I get that feeling, I usually eat a meal before I go to a place I know has food options I can't eat. Or, if I have to leave, I do so discretely, eat fast, then come back. Making a big show about it is super disrespectful in my opinion, and I never want people to feel bad or offended if I can't eat what they offer. People can be VERY sensitive about food. It looks rude as hell when a couple literally pays money for catering options just to have their guests parade other food options. It says \"the food you picked sucks, this is better\" even if you didn't mean to say that.\n\nYou and your son owe the bride and groom an apology. I hope you refused the option to have them purchase a plate for your son, but I can bet the other people that wanted him to bring them back food wasted the bride and groom's money. YTA. You can be a respectful picky eater.", "YTA \u201cLetting\u201d your son? He\u2019s a grown ass adult! Why did he feel he had to ask his mommy? Let him make his own crappy decisions.", "If you're son was 4 okay, let him bring his chicken nuggies to a wedding.

Most do.", "yta\n\ni ll be honest, picky eater is a subject i dont want to go into because it usually gets heated. however, i dont think there is something necessarily wrong with having gotten his own food *IIIFFFFFF* he had kept it to himself. he didnt and even had brought food back which is super disrespectful.", "YTA\n\nSending him for food wasn\u2019t an issue but having him eat it during the reception was a total A H move. He should have eaten in his car.", "INFO: Does your son have any kind of disability or is neurodivergent?", "INFO: is your child 22 years old and male (22Male) or 22 months old (22Months)?", "Ugh\u2026 for a 22 year old? YTA. He\u2019s an enabled child.", "22 years old and in a buffet your adult \"child \"couldnt find anything they could eat .... really ... you enabled this behaviour.... he just wanted fast/junk food .... you have raised a kid who is addicted to junk food and like any junkie he knows how to play you .... trust me if he had nothing else to eat ... he would eat from the buffet  .... fast food is NOT real food if he is so picky that he only eats fast food which it seems you encouraged/enabled he will probably die before you", "YTA\n\nI am very neurodivergent and somewhat of a picky eater. I also have food allergies. And I would never do something like this - if I did I would PLAN IT BEFORE HAND WITH THE BRIDE AND GROOM. that and why tf would you bring food back for others?

Treat him like one.", "YTA - It\u2019s never okay to bring in outside food to a place unless that place has a policy that allows for outside food. I would be appalled as well.

Bringing in outside food is not an option.", "22 lmao", "YTA\n\nYou and your son have no manners.", "What do you mean, you \u201clet\u201d your adult son get fast food? He does whatever he needs to do - and answers for himself. If anyone has a problem, refer them to him.", "EDIT: OP has said in a comment that the son in question is not ND. So, my judgement is YTA. Even prior to knowing that, this was already rude and poorly handled- as I state in my comment and as others have said, if OP's son was ND and needed different food, he should have eaten it elsewhere. Bringing stuff for other people is just flat-out unacceptable, 100%. \n\nBefore I decide, gonna echo the question I see a lot below- is there a reason your son is a picky eater?\n\nWhile I do agree that it was rude- he should have eaten it elsewhere, I feel like a lot of people underestimate or flat-out do not understand just how severe sensitivity to foods can be in neurodivergent people. For those of us who don't have those sensitivities, it looks like picky eating and comes across as just being \"immature\" or \"trying to be rude\" or \"entitled\". But for people with those sensitivities, it's PAINFUL to encounter a stimulus, like taste, that they can't handle.\n\nI can't speak for food, but as someone with ADHD I get overstimulated REALLY easily by certain things. It's not just an annoyance- my entire body and brain goes into fight or flight. I can't focus on anything else when I get overstimulated. It is physically uncomfortable, sometimes unbearable, depending on how bad it is. So if your son is, like me and other ND people, super sensitive to certain things? You should have handled it better and probably asked him to eat it outside, but he needed that accommodation.\n\nNow. Him bringing things back for OTHER people to eat, just because? Hell no. That is 100% rude as fuck and that is an AH move.", "YTA.\n\nYour kid knows he's a picky eater. He's 22; this can't be the first time he hasn't liked a catered meal. He can eat before he goes or stay at the fast food place and finish off a burger in 10 minutes. He doesn't need to bring fast food back to a venue that may have a no outside food policy and hand out burgers and nuggets in front of people while probably paid $100 a plate or more for that meal.", "YTA. Bringing in outside food to a wedding is incredibly trashy and rude. He\u2019s a 22 year old, not 2 lmao", "YTA. That\u2019s tacky as hell.

It is very rude to bring fast food into a wedding reception. You shouldn't enable this, it is beyond rude. A wedding and a catered event. The caterers would be very annoyed and the venue.

If he had just gotten it for himself and no one else I don\u2019t the he would be an asshole, however, I can also understand that they most likely spent a lot of money on the food. I work in a restaurant and getting an event catered(especially a wedding) costs hundreds if not thousands of dollars, so I can see why the bride was upset about multiple people eating fast food instead.", "If the groom and bride don\u2019t care I\u2019ll say NTA, but I also think you are being intentionally oblivious to social cues. Even people with dietary restrictions don\u2019t bring their own food to a wedding, you can endure 4 hrs without eating or you can leave early and then eat.", "Info: is there any reason why he is a picky eater?", "N T A for getting food but YTA and so is he for bringing it back to the reception.

I think it\u2019s ridiculous that everyone thinks he should have just went hungry for who knows how long because some irrelevant people thought they should get to dictate his dinner choices.

He has absolutely went an entire day without eating because he can\u2019t bring himself to eat what is offered at an event. Anybody who doesn\u2019t know this would just assume he\u2019s picky and he doesn\u2019t owe anyone his medical history, particularly since this disorder is so misrepresented in media to the point people are completely ignorant about it and then watch him to see if he\u2019ll do something \u201cfunny\u201d or don\u2019t realize or understand that it causes other \u201cunseen\u201d issues. If I have an opportunity to step away and get him food I\u2019m taking it and I don\u2019t care if it offends others, I\u2019m not making him go hungry so somebody can feel fuzzy about the incredible food they offered.

If crappy- or, \u201cnot great\u201d- food has been her experience at weddings, it\u2019s all the more reason to have come up with a plan for Johnny ahead of time.\n\nHaha, I am just now seeing even more layers to this story\u2026 the pseudonym she picks for her son is \u201cJohnny,\u201d and meant to invoke a mental image of a child, like elementary school aged, and to make us feel sympathetic to him, his picky eating, and to her- still unable to understand why she\u2019s the asshole here.", "This was my thought exactly! If he couldn't wait to eat later then this was the polite option.", "I agree. I\u2019m a little older than him and am also a super picky eater. If I go somewhere with food I can\u2019t eat I just don\u2019t eat and get something later. Im sure anyone who\u2019s picky is familiar with just eating before or after an event, it\u2019s not a big deal. And quietly leaving for a bit at a wedding is super easy.", "My mother would be appalled if i brought food back into a wedding when i was 12 let alone 22. Why didn't he eat it in the car? Why would you bring food for other people? All this is so rude i can't believe they even have to ask who TA is", "Bets are it was greasy smelly KFC.", "I worked for a wedding venue in my early 20s. Which is why I had my wedding at a state park lol.", "All good!", "Get out, she's still refusing her judgement. \n\nBreak out the popcorn, I'm going for a deep dive.", "I\u2019m curious what their daily diets look like. And their cholesterol. Picky eaters eating only burgers and fries doesn\u2019t sound like picking eating, it sounds like junk food addiction and type 2 diabetes.", "so the purple tie-dye ones?", "Can you imagine dating a guy who does something like this? Lol", "I mean, even for a toddler I think this would be tacky AF. I can see bringing along\\` a GoGurt and some cheerios but buying him a whole-ass Happy Meal to bring to a formal wedding reception?  Hell no.", "Nope, OP said it was mashed potatoes, tenderloin, BBQ beef, soup, and several sides, it sounds like it was delicious.  Apparently OPs son just can't eat things that aren't fried though....", "She updated with the menu.... not vegan, and even had pasta, tenderloin... and the 22 year old chose a miccy d's.\nSounds more like a fast food addiction than \"picky eater\" tbh", "I wonder if they wore shoes.", "Same. I thought it was a 22 month old not 22 YEAR old. \n\nYTA, op.", "My relative is a child, and even they know not to do this. If example at a buffet if there were 9 dishes and there was only one they liked, they would load up on that on dish alone. It\u2019s just about decent respect, which OP & son clearly doesn\u2019t have any of. It\u2019s one event, suck it up.

Hopefully he will stay with Mommy and we won't be reading stories from his partners on another subreddit.", "Which means he only eats crap.", "More like spoiled", "Lol, date night dinners would be plastic cups of milk and bowls of spaghetti-os, with animal crackers for dessert\u2026.. while his mommy hovers over him making sure he\u2019s ok.", "And if he WERE 22 mos. old, the parents would have brought along a little pre-made meal or snacks for him, as they would be used to feeding him and toddlers can get picky at the most inconvenient times. But wow, 22 years. Good heavens.\n\nETA:  YTA", "Exactly.  I eat alllll the things except for an allergy to shellfish that open like < but I always carry emergency snacks.  If u need an almond butter cracker snack, I\u2019ve got you.  22 years and just nurtured tomfoolery", "At the very least, if you're going to run out and buy fast food in the middle of the reception, have the decency to scarf it down in the car.", "Or after even. There are a lot of better options than snubbing the menu and openly eating fast food", "In my case, the bride was from an Asian culture which has a shellfish-oriented menu.  It was just one day & I was a little woozy by the end of it, but I obviously survived.  \n\nAlso commenting on OP\u2019s edit - \u201cone or two chicken bones ended up on the floor of the venue\u201d - WHAT?  Your \u201cchild\u201d is a 22-year-old adult with the palate of a toddler, brings outside food into another establishment AND THEN GETS BONES ON THE FLOOR?  OP = YTA, but the bigger question is why your son behaves like a savage.", "How tf do chicken bones end up on the dance floor, OP? Is your 22 yr old still in nappies too, and tosses his food on the floor?\n\nYTA and you are stunting your adult son with this nonsense.", "That was probably just the 22 year old.", "I love your user name!  I have a pit bull - husky mix.  She's the sweetest!", "Every night in OP\u2019s house:\n\n>Mommmmmmmyyyyyy!! I need my tendies!!! NOWWWWWWWWWW!!!", "OMG I had not gone back to read edits yet - that is INSANE!!!! A whole family of AH\u2019s! Tacky, and also probably a slew of health code violations. Many venues do not allow outside food or alcohol because of licensing restrictions & health codes. What a disaster, no wonder the bride\u2019s family were appalled.  Not to mention the money spent on food that went to waste just to be replaced by fast food.\n\nGlad you survived the shellfish wedding. I also survived the southern bbq wedding. I had driven that night so I had to be careful about drinking (which was probably for the best since I didn\u2019t eat & didn\u2019t go nuts during the cocktail hour before I realized there was nothing to eat), but I had a nice big glass of wine with my curry later!", "Does she talk a lot and have blue eyes? She sounds awesome.", "Tell me you're a Republican mom without telling me you're a Republican mom. Good girl, raising another asshole", "You should have fed your 264 month old before the wedding, or he could have eaten in the car or waited until after the wedding to eat.  YTA and so is your son.", "There are a few levels here. To you - yta. You could have schooled him and said something like keep it to your self, eat the food in the car and don\u2019t let on that you left at all. You should be telling him what a bad habit he has and to get over being a picky eater.\n\nTo your son - big time yta. At 22 he should know that his behavior is impolite. He should know not to complain, not to let on he is going and he should have known not to bring any food into the reception. He acted like a real prick. \n\nYta also to the wedding guests who asked for fast food.", "I run a hotel with a wedding venue area. We do our own catering. If we cater WE DO NOT ALLOW OUTSIDE FOOD. It's a health code violation. And it's a huge insult to my catering team who worked on the meal for hours.

I love it.\n\nYTA.", "Right?  Worst case, he could have left & eaten food before he came back, but it is still a tacky move. Big slap in the face to couple hosting. But I\u2019d OP thinks it is fine, I see where he gets his manners. He isn\u2019t a toddler. Huge YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou embarrassed yourself and the bride and groom. \n\nYou and your son are not the main characters here. \n\nThis is basic etiquette.", "Don\u2019t be rude.

Who does that? A dog?", "So I agree with all this critique but what shocks me more, it would have been very easy for son to leave without telling anyone, eat in the car and return to the party. OP and son made a scene by their actions and that was totally unnecessary, for that alone, let alone everything else you mentioned OP and her son are huge gaping AH", "I'm getting married in April. $100 per person. If anyone brings outside food they owe me $100.", "This and all the comments that follow. Seriously OP, none of your edits change any of this and how messed up that was. YTA and an enabler.", "Not only this, they also placed liability on the venue if someone got sick from the outside food. \n\nOP, her son and anyone else who ate that food, placed the venue in a very bad spot. \n\nYTA OP, and so is your son and anyone else who ate that fast find. And y'all are nasty. Couldn't even contain the bones to your table?!", "At first I was like eh, I have picky eaters too but then I saw pasta and was like WTF what picky eater doesn't like pasta? Isn't that like a picky eater staple? When all else fails, buttered pasta. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nYTA.  My son was school age and we were in a wedding and he was picky AF and he kept whining. I said look idk what to tell you, if you're hungry enough you'll at least try something.\n\nHe tried the pasta with vodka sauce. And ten pieces of bread.\n\nThey are paying for you to eat there. The LEAST he could have done is TRY something. He's 22. Or if he keeps stomping his feet and you keep coddling him, send him to McDonald's to eat the food THERE. Don't bring it back to some place where they PAID for you to eat.", "I got married in Pittsburgh where \"cookie tables\" are a wedding tradition (friends and family all bring homemade cookies to the reception). The contract with the venue specifically said that the cookie table was the only exception to the \"no outside food\" policy.\n\nSo yeah, YTA if for no other reason than you may have gotten the wedding party in trouble because your 22-year-old can't be discreet.", "Special requests outside of allergies are fucking tacky and disrespectful also !", "Tbf, she did say that that was \u201cunfortunate\u201d. /s", "I have low blood sugar and POTS so I carry snacks in my purse for events like this, just incase the ceremony is longer than expected or the food is delayed. It's super easy to do it discretely and I never had a problem.", "It sounds like some weird reality show where hillbillies wreck the wedding", "Yeah, our venue had a rule that only children under 2 could have their own food brought in, because somehow babies are exempt from the liability. Anyone else required a special contract.", "Because all he eats are the air fried dino nuggets she brings to the basement to him every night.", "When my kid was a toddler and I took her to a fancy ass wedding, she ate rolls, mashed potatoes and whatever veggies they had.

It's a couple of hours, eat some of the nice meal provided and then stop and stuff your face  with garbage on the way home.", "Yep. All this too! The venue will have a risk of contamination and can be held liable, plus they **will** charge the bride and groom, even purely for the fact it's a wedding.", "Even if he was a fussy toddler he either eats the food or stays home.

Why even tell anyone you're leaving to go get it. Just do it and come back. Or eat before you go...or go in between the ceremony and reception...there were so many options. Why pick the WORST one. Dude seems extremely entitled and rude imo. Probably bc his parents have coddled him his whole life.", "Same! I thought my eyes deceived me the first time and had to read it again just to be sure she wasn\u2019t talking about a toddler. OP probably still treats him like one too, I\u2019m surprised she let him drive her car!\n\nOP, YTA and downright rude. Your son is not a child and you\u2019re turning him into an AH like you.
