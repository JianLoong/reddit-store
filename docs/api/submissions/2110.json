It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them.\n\n\nAs a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event.\n\nShe started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the \"perfect compromise\".\n\n\nUpdate: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week. Y'all happy now? Though I appreciate some insightful comments on the situation. Some others?.....not so much especially with those assumptions claiming that my wife has allergies, SHE DOES NOT! Y'all get that from? But anyway. S'all good now I guess though I'm not too thrilled with her decision. I feel like she's doing it to spite me or get me to cave in.", "created_utc": 1668259855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt750d/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_she_can_stay_home/", "score": 14237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are there typically any dishes that work for your wife?\n\nEdited in response to OP update:  YTA.  Considering the unwillingness to answer questions here, I'm going to guess there hasn't been a lot of discussion with your wife in which you were open to options.  Saying she does not have allergies does not preclude sensitivities, intolerances, or bad past experiences with food.  Both the obligation to adapt (reasonably) to guests as a measure of hospitality and the acceptability of taking food to an event vary by both culture and individual family in American culture.  There's not one hard and fast rule for it.", "YTA. She offered compromise. My wife's family does the feast of the 7 fishes. I hate fish.

So let me recap:\n\n* She came up with a solution to endure the hell that is being around your mother.\n* You told her you were too scared of mommy to even allow your wife to suggest finding a solution.

I don\u2019t care if they have to bring their own food because having my loved ones with me is what matters. Not the food. \n\nIf your wife is that picky, there\u2019s probably something else going on. She could be a super taster or have some sort of sensory processing or an ED. While I have  a hard time understanding picky eaters and just eat whatever is served, you can\u2019t control how others eat. If you\u2019re intending to be with your wife for the long haul, excluding her from major holidays is only going to alienate her and send her packing. YTA.", "YTA. Your wife is doing exactly what those with food allergies do. Bring their own food. There is nothing wrong with that, at all. Your mom needs to not be so easily offended by your wife's food preferences.", "Her compromise is totally reasonable. She wants to be with you on the holiday, who cares what she's eating. \n\nAlso, why aren't you or your mom trying to make something she will like to add to everything?

First, you don't explain why your wife is a \"picky eater\" and I suspect it's not because she just doesn't like stuff but that there are issues with certain foods. My wife has numerous issues that make regular meals a problem. For example, she can't have ordinary black pepper. It took me 15+ years to get my mom to fully realize how complex my wife's dietary restrictions are. Bringing food is a perfectly acceptable alternative these days. If your mom can't support that and can't support making something that your wife can eat, then neither of you should go.\n\nSecond, you're siding with your mom over your wife. Did you exchange marriage vows with your mom too? Is that why you won't support and defend the person you supposedly chose to build a life with? Keep doing that and you won't have a wife anymore.

She has eating and food issues, and is dealing with them in a thoughtful way so that no one else has to be bothered by them. She's not putting the responsibility of dealing with them on anyone else but herself. It's a considerate way of dealing with things.", "YTA she offered a solution. You\u2019re prioritizing your mom over your wife and you likely knew this about your wife before you married her.

How dare your mother make her feel uncomfortable about what food she does and doesn't like. That's so fucking rude and your poor wife must dread the holidays every year. For some reason people think they have the right to attack \"picky eaters\". You need to grow up, put your horrible mother in her place and support your wife.

She did the right thing to avoid confrontation this year and  because of that you told her to not go!? The fuck kinda logic is that.  \n\nWhy would anyone get offended (I\u2019m sure some people with a complex do) at someone with different dietary needs bringing their own meal.  She could have asked your mother to abide by the things she WILL eat and make for her. Aaaand do you think that would have gone over any better then her not eating or bringing her own? I think not sir, I think not", "Yeah people bring their own food to things all the time so I don\u2019t understand what your issue is. What do you think people with allergies do? Vegans?

This is a very reasonable compromise that your wife offered.  Telling her to choose between starving and staying home on a holiday?! Am I reading that correctly?!  Your mom is also an AH.

There is absolutely no reason to be offended over this and make it into a \u201cshitshow.\u201d  I have made food that some people love and others haven\u2019t liked and some won\u2019t touch.

So I know how your wife feels. Your wife tried to find the happy medium and let's her enjoy the festivities while also eating foods she likes. But you, without even mentioning it to your mom, just shot her plan down point blank. And then have the audacity to tell your WIFE that your MOM wouldn't like it? Did you marry your mom or your wife? Because you're more willing to protect the feelings of your mom than your wife and that makes you the AH. I have my happy medium, I'm going to his house and they are giving me mac and cheese I can eat, which is only Kraft mac and cheese, but they were ok with that. You won't even try to defend your wife.
