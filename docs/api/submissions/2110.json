It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them.\n\n\nAs a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event.\n\nShe started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the \"perfect compromise\".", "created_utc": 1668259855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt750d/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_she_can_stay_home/", "score": 925, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not the food. \n\nIf your wife is that picky, there\u2019s probably something else going on. She could be a super taster or have some sort of sensory processing or an ED. While I have  a hard time understanding picky eaters and just eat whatever is served, you can\u2019t control how others eat.

It took me 15+ years to get my mom to fully realize how complex my wife's dietary restrictions are. Bringing food is a perfectly acceptable alternative these days.

Smells good just can\u2019t swallow it I\u2019ve tried.\n\nIf people were less judgmental it wouldn\u2019t be taboo to be picky.  Did you know Tom Selleck is a picky eater too?", "Yepp that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t eaten most meat in 25+ years.  I like a nice piece of crispy (has to be crispy) bacon now and again.\n\nI\u2019ve tried the \u201cjust try it\u201d bit and I just cannot do it.  People just don\u2019t understand how much I hate being picky.  \n\nGoing to restaurants is always tough.  I always have to check menus ahead of time.  Just to ensure there is actually something I\u2019ll eat.  It\u2019d be easier if I ate chicken but I can\u2019t even eat chicken.", "Their point is, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s AFRID, or allergies, or they\u2019re vegan or anything else. MIL won\u2019t accommodate a guests preferences - her own DIL no less- and if DIL offers to bring her own food, that\u2019s not allowed either? That\u2019s ridiculous. She should be able to bring her own food. I have a feeling it\u2019s a legit reason (eg she\u2019s vegan or vegetarian) which is why OP isn\u2019t mentioning it as it would weaken his case. Either way, he and his mom are TA for treating her like an unwanted family member.", "which is why i said it\u2019s not unreasonable for her to bring her own food.", "Yeah, when I go home for Thanksgiving (which I essentially never do anymore), I eat the crescent rolls and mashed potatoes and gravy and that's it.\n\nI don't eat jello with canned fruit and marshmallows in it.  My mother's green bean casserole is slimy and disgusting, and she manages to even make the dark meat dry on the turkey.\n\nI just have 3 slices of apple pie later, and snack more during the morning so I'm not hungry.\n\nI don't know if the mother's house is far enough away that they stay for several days or not, but there are ways OP could make sure his wife has enough food either before they go that day, or he can offer to bring a dish and make sure that is something his wife eats, but he should be doing the leg work to make sure his wife has food at his mother's house.\n\nHis attitude of \"just try it\" is clearly a red flag because this is obviously not the first time, she has certainly \"just tried it\" before she got to this point...  OP is being ridiculous here!", "I agree so much with you\u2026 also why is mom taking it as an insult instead of being an \u201cadult\u201d and chalking it up as someone with different taste/wants and just saying its ok i want them to feel included which like you said is what the holidays are about. Not some eat my food or be hated/shunned.", "Woohoo lol", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "So meditate on why that perfectly reasonable solution \"drives you up the wall\"."]}
