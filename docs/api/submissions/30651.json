I told her that it\u2019s not like that and then she asked what is the point in living with them if I don\u2019t \u00ab\u00a0at least get something from them\u00a0\u00bb. I sighed. Told her my truth : these boys are my family. They are my brothers more than she\u2019s ever been my mom. Lance drove me to every OB appointment when I was pregnant. Riley was the one holding my hand when I was in labor. They are the ones I can trust with my kids lives. They have been here for me through thick and thin while she was happy to ignore me so she could \u00ab\u00a0live her best life\u00a0\u00bb. I told her that if she believes I don\u2019t find anything in their friendship then she needs a serious reality check. She huffed and left and ever since, her side of the family calls me ungrateful and says that it was uncalled for.\n\nReddit : AITA here ?", "created_utc": 1699539426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rdwol/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_needs_a_reality_check/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have explained how they helped you and were like brothers without bluntly articulating her inadequacies.

While I 100% get exactly what societal factors would lead a 52 year old woman to being unable to understand a relationship/family unit that doesn't look traditional, the fact that she devalued it and tried to turn it into something sexual was super inappropriate and she probably does need a reality check. It sounds to me like she has a really unhealthy view of love and relationships, but you have no obligation to validate or accept that, especially when she's judging your family and saying shitty things about those relationships.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
