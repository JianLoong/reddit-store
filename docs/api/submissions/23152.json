I was actually at work about 30 mins away but left early at 11pm due to weather.My bf (34) of 1 yr (we\u2019re still together) was known to not answer calls/texts cuz it was rude if he was hanging out with his friends. Before I left I told him I was coming home early & that I was nervous about the drive. I asked him to please turn on his sound while at the bar since I was worried. He refused telling me I was controlling because he was out so I asked him to keep the phone face up and on vibrate so he could feel/see the call & he agreed.\n\nThe storm was insane, I could barely see in front of me and the cars had their hazards on. Them an 18 wheeler starts to lose control and they come barreling towards me so I swerve and drive full speed into the grass on the side of the highway. Thankfully the 18 wheeler was able to avoid hitting me but the driver didn\u2019t stop to check on me and make sure I was ok. While I wasn\u2019t physically hurt, I started to smell smoke and I jump out of the car afraid it was somehow damaged when I went off road. I grabbed my phone and jacket from the car to call my bf who was 15 mins away, to come and look at the car and make sure it was safe to drive. I call, no answer, and again. At some point I went from scared to mad. My car was still smoking and I was on the dark stretch of hwy. Eventually, the car stopped smoking and I checked it out myself and got back on the road. Instead of going home, I drove to the bar where he was. I called 20 times & I just got mad with each ring.I decided I was going to break up with him give him a piece of my mind.\n\nI pull into the parking lot and I can see that he\u2019s laughing with his friends and enjoying his beer and his phone is face down. I call him one last time to see if he was actively ignoring my calls and he doesn\u2019t even look down. I start to walk towards him and I swear I was so mad. At some point he looks to up see me walking toward him with a look that could cut. That\u2019s when he looks down at his phone & I could see the color drain from his face. At that point I didn\u2019t care if I embarrassed him so I apologize to his friends for the interruption but I have to drag him to the back of the outdoor bar to chew him out. Now, it\u2019s still raining & I tell him to fuck off since I\u2019d spent 20 mins in the rain & splashed by cars. He says he\u2019s not sure why I was mad, I wasn\u2019t hurt & he couldn\u2019t do much to help me anyways. I said I did have an emergency & he didn\u2019t answer. So I told him off & I leave back to my place to cry & take a warm shower. He follows me home, apologizes profusely & I forgave him because he sounded sincere. We are now married for 1.5 yrs & he says he\u2019s dependable & I bring up that night. He said that it wasn\u2019t bad since I wasn\u2019t injured. So I told him I was posting this on Reddit to ask, AITA?", "created_utc": 1690353702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159xw9f/aita_for_telling_my_husband_hes_unreliable_after/", "score": 1569, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As his partner, he should be prioritizing you over his social event especially in an emergency. I could see him ignoring you if you were constantly messaging asking what he was doing and who he was with. But this is very different. You maybe could have communicated better in the moment instead of \u201cchewing him out,\u201d but I totally understand you were in a heightened emotional state for the event itself and from being upset with him.", "Info: other than this one instance, what other examples do you have?

You were on a highway for 20 minutes in a storm in the dark, all it would take is ANOTHER accident or a flash flood (don't know if that's a concern for the area) for you to be dead. Thank god it was only 20 minutes, too. He's horrible for downplaying the situation and for not helping you, and I can't believe he's STILL trying to downplay it.

If he started doing it because the someone was you, you lose the moral high ground here because you created the situation yourself. Does he at least agree that if/when you have children, he is going to have to answer calls from you because it could be an emergency with the kids? If you are the reason that he started switching the ringer off, you are going to have to agree to only call him when it is an emergency or something that won't wait until he comes home.\n\nKudos for dragging him to thee back of the bar for the chewing out, some people would  have done it in front of his buddies and that is a bad precedent to start off with in a relationship.\n\nWhy couldn't he have been kinder and gentler with you as he knew (presumably) that this was your first big flooding/super storm situation? Especially at 11pm - he knew it was dark, storming like crazy, and that you might encounter some flooded roadways while driving home! The very least he could have done was answer the phone and be supportive. Alternatively, he could have been a real gentleman and awesome bf by offering to come get you and drive you home or if leaving your car at work was not an option, he could have followed you home so that you could feel safer (not as good ad driving you but better than what he did).\n\nThis was not solely an \"Are you dependable?\" situation, it was a \"Are you rude and do not care about my fears and insecurity due to that being my first time driving here in a big super storm/flooding situation and you did not even try to help me or take my fears into account. Saying that it wasn't bad because you were not hurt so it doesn't count because you did not get hurt is not okay - he was not answering his phone and it could have been anything - you, telling him you had been involved in an accident and were in the ER, waiting to be seen by the doctor or it could been your parents trying to call him because they had received the phone call no parent every wants to receive, that you had been involved in an accident and had been declared dead at the scene, but he did not know because he did not answer his phone, not even after you asked him to do so because you were fearful of driving home from work in the storm. \n\nI think since he apologized sincerely and profusely and you married him, you need to let it go now and stop bringing it up. It is in the past and it sounds like he is trying so let him show you that he has improved and acknowledge his newer (hopefully) more considerate ways.  However, it would be a really great thing to have an agreement about how such situations  will be handled in the future - i.e. when he is out with his friends, you agree to only call if something is a true emergency and cannot wait until he gets home.

She knew he had been drinking. Is she advocating for putting a drunk driver on the road in the middle of a storm? That would only add more risk to everyone who was driving that night. With his phone on vibrate, he could've at least answered and talked to her, tried to help her calm down, give her advice on how to proceed, etc, but under no circumstance should he have been driving.\n\nAlso, he *did* apologize.

Big difference.", "\n\n>but you decided to forgive him\n\nshe very clearly did not if she's still bringing it up", "I feel like if this was a common theme, we'd be hearing about *that*, not one night years ago.   \n\n\nIt's the absence of other examples that makes me believe this is not worth holding a grudge over.", "Yeah don\u2019t call the fire station you wet flannel", "agreed i would\u2019ve broken up with him for not caring enough to turn his ringer on. no way his buddies should be mad if he says \u201cmy gf is worried bc of the storm so i\u2019m gonna keep my ringer on in case she needs something\u201d. very inconsiderate and rude of him imo", "If you require constant and unfaltering support from another person to exist, that's a personal issue.   \n\n\nAlso, read the post again. He apologized profusely. He's not adamant he did nothing wrong. To hold something like this over someone else for years is psychotic. Seek therapy.", "Omg what if OP is actually three owls in a trenchcoat", "Also, OP tells of this scary storm that they aren\u2019t comfortable or safe driving in but then decides to drive to the bar before going home? Sounds like it wasn\u2019t actually that bad out. \nToo many comments focus on the fact this is brought back up years later but I don\u2019t think boyfriend was wrong from the start. Maybe a little cold hearted but not the asshole. OP sounds like they want prince/princess treatment and were mad they didn\u2019t get it", "Yasssss. If the genders were reversed everyone would be saying he\u2019s too controlling and red flags etc not respecting your time and independence out with friends.\n\nGirl you need some accountability and responsibility in my opinion.", "Excellent point. If the roles were reversed we'd no doubt be hearing shit like 'you're not his mommy' or 'you're not his taxi service'.", "You responded to the wrong incident. That's the context. OP is asking AITA for bringing it up four years later after he'd already apologised sincerely at the time.", "I agree. \n\nHe willfully put his phone upside down and went against their agreement. She was scared, living in a new town. He was absolutely being self centred with the way he handled that situation. Quite honestly that kind of behavior during the flooding KNOWING your partner was scared is a major major red flag to me. Then he apologized profusely because that\u2019s what she wanted to hear and he wanted to shut her up about it. He clearly didn\u2019t mean the apology if he still doesn\u2019t think what he did was wrong. I know some men like this. They\u2019re garbage partners to their wives and they have this weird smugness about it. \n\nThere\u2019s no point in bringing it up again and again though. He clearly doesn\u2019t get it and doesn\u2019t want to. If this is something that she\u2019s still struggling with I think couples therapy may be a good call. Get some actual closure, have a professional guiding you both through and learn to communicate better. If he refuses to go or scoffs at the idea it might be worth looking at options to end it. If you\u2019re that hurt and your partner doesn\u2019t want to do anything healthy to move past it then it\u2019s not going to be a happy marriage long term. The resentment is just going to get worse.", "It obviously still IS a sore point in their relationship that OP can't get past. The fact that the entirety of this post is about that night and then a brief few sentences about present day says a lot. She never moved past it and likely will never move past it, so she's holding this against him, subconsciously or not. It's been eating at their relationship ever since that night.\n\nThere's nothing in the post to say if he's changed or not so we can't even say for sure if she's rightfully bringing it up against him because he's still the same or if she's holding a grudge after all these years, despite the fact that he's changed. His comment does point toward the former so I'm not even sure if there's a relationship that can be salvaged here. It's always going to be The Thing That's Brought Up In Fights, and that's not a healthy thing in a relationship. It might even be one of the most unhealthy aspects.", "I don't think she's TA for any of the upset over this incident. I'd have stood on the sidelines and cheered had she ended things properly at that point.\n\nBut choosing to carry on, get married, but dangle that day over him? That's not good. It's not healthy for either party. After 4 years, the obviously vivid memories of that day are living rent-free in the front of OP's brain and putting aside the impact on the relaitionship for the moment, this sounds exhausting to live with in its own right.", "Yep. What he did was bad and he was wrong for that but continually revisiting it as a \"gotcha\" over a year after is wrong as well. The OP needs to decide which is more important: being right or having a healthy and happy marriage, but if she continues down this road she can't have both.", "And if he doesn\u2019t acknowledge it, it will breed resentment in her, which it clearly has. Anytime you have a BIG breech of trust in a partner, counselling is necessary imo. They both need the tools to deal with this properly and frankly she will never be able to get over it if he never properly acknowledges the pain he caused her and how scary it must\u2019ve been for her. This should\u2019ve been dealt with far before they got married.", "There's no relationship at all. She's just the last to him. He's not dependable as to him she's not a priority at all.\n\nEveryone has priorities, and when you get into a relationship, your partner becomes another one, and an important one.\nFor this man, she isn't even close to anything like that.\n\nTo start, it's rude to stay with the phone while hanging out with people, but no one will get mad if you take 10 seconds to answer something that matters to your partner.\n\nBut no, this man just Mustn't be disturbed in the slightest (?). And he can't even agree to keep a bit of attention when a hurricane is coming and his wife is out there driving?\n\nHe isn't in a relationship as he shows 0 commitment and respect towards her, and not even think about her while she can be in a potential deathly situation.\n\nYes, she's the AH for staying with that man while being less important than a fucking beer to him.", "Also he would be terrible to coparent a child with. I would absolutely leave if i were op because he doesn\u2019t acknowledge what he did wrong and how scared she felt. She needs a stronger partner honestly. Op NTA but you must stop bringing up the past if you are in your gut still PISSED he was useless during an emergency.", "I understand being upset and wanting to call someone when that happens, but it also doesn\u2019t sound like there was anything he could really do anyway? He was drinking at a bar and she expected him to drive to her to check out her car? Which after chilling out for 2 seconds she realized was fine lol. Call a cab, 911, or tow truck if you can\u2019t reach your bf.", ">and she wants reassurance.\n\nI get this.  But if she didn't get it the night of, then she was never going to.  Even over a year later he's not apologizing and still doesn't see it as a big deal/what he did wrong.\n\nIt was up to OP to either move past it and let it go, or break up.  She did neither.  \n\nSo OP if you're reading any of these responses, either divorce him or LET IT GO.", "I wonder if he went through something really bad and so it's just thrown off his sense of severity. I've had 3 open heart surgeries and am a chronic pain patient. When I say something isn't that bad... I mean its not that bad for me but for the average person? Yeah they'd probably end up in the hospital...", "OK so why did she marry this completely unreliable person then?", "She trusted him enough she expected him to drive while intoxicated through a storm she herself was scared to drive in", "Amen. There\u2019s plenty of mistakes I made with my ex, we both were going through a lot of mental health struggles.\n\nBut no matter what I did, it\u2019s like those mistakes were \u201cproven\u201d notches against me that what always come back up no matter how much I thought I had finally done enough to show I learned. \n\nLike at some point you gotta make the choice to either support your partner and forgive or don\u2019t", "No he didn't. He questioned whether it was bad enough to still be throwing it in his face *four years later* after having made a full apology at the time and ostensibly not having given her any better examples of being unreliable since then.", "Counterpoint, he obviously did, or she wouldn't have to go all the way back to that one single incident to support her assertion.  She'd have more, and more recent, examples.", "No, he apologized profusely. Entirely accepting responsibility.   \n\n\nDismissing an event from years ago is healthy. Holding onto it is the weird thing. Very self destructive and spiteful.", "So why marry that person then?  If she felt that strongly that she wanted to break up, by all means do that.  But at some point if you stay with that person, you need to move on from a 1 time situation 4 years ago.", "Idk man I mean if my wife was alone at night and scared in the rain after almost being hit and didn\u2019t understand why her car was smoking I\u2019d want her to call emergency services and have them come as well as a tow truck. It\u2019s better for her to feel safe and considering she\u2019s on the side of the road at night alone shit could go really bad. I know she wouldn\u2019t even be comfortable being alone with the tow truck driver. I definitely think it\u2019s not unwarranted to call emergency services in this situation.", "What is the point of having a partner in life if they aren\u2019t going to put in minimum effort to be there for the other person?! \n\nLike holy fuck just be single if paying attention to your phone is too much effort to make sure the person you supposedly love gets home ok in a storm\u2026. Like it\u2019s bare minimum effort to show you care about someone.", "If it was unsafe to drive, yes! I've stayed at work several hours after my shift was done because the road conditions were bad. \n\nOver and above that, her husband was drinking. So it's better that *he* drives in the bad weather, under the influence?", "I mean, if the storm is as dangerous as she makes it out to be, and she was scared to drive, that would have been the safer option, even if not ideal", ">Is she advocating for putting a drunk driver on the road in the middle of a storm?\n\nMy first reaction was that he could've called someone sober.  But then I realized *she* could've called someone sober, too.  The way she tells the story, it sounds like she was reasonable and sympathetic that night, but, really, she wasn't.  She didn't want to be rescued from the situation; she wanted *him* to rescue her.  So much so that she's actively undermining her marriage four years later because of it.  That's nuts.\n\nI get that she was new to town, but if he was the only in-town number on her mobile phone, then that's a whole other problem.  And the idea of some commenters that he's \"still unrepentant\" is B.S., too.  He apologized profusely; there are just so many times you can apologize for the same thing before saying that it wasn't bad enough to justify hanging over his head for so long.\n\nOP has a screw loose.  The fact that the letters N, T, and A are even involved here are a credit to her storytelling, but calling your spouse \"undependable\" over something that happened so long ago *and then posting on AITA about it*?  Total AH move.", ">I don\u2019t think boyfriend was wrong from the start\n\nHe agreed to do something he knew would make her feel better and safer, then didn't do it.  I'll defend him for not being malicious, for being unfairly hounded years later, and for not minimizing the situation just by pointing out her present-day response is disproportionate.  But to deny he was wrong at all seems farfetched.", "Even if you are drinking you can still pick up the phone, calm your partner down, tell them what to do etc. Provide emotional support.", "I\u2019m convinced quite a few people in here always vote with their gender, dude makes a mistake years ago and the wife is still badgering him about it and somehow there are still a few who think the husband is the AH.\n\nPeople make mistakes", "I'd also add to never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity.  It's an assumption that he put his phone down in an active attempt to ignore her rather than out of habit, forgetting her request at the moment.  In fact, I'd say that the former is unlikely because - if he really thought she'd be trying to contact him - he knew he'd be in big trouble for not paying attention.\n\nHe was still in the wrong at the time, but (1) that doesn't make it malicious, and (2) that doesn't justify her maliciousness four years later.", "She didin't expect him to drive she expected him to pick up his phone. You can't do that after a beer?", "Yeppers", "It was 4 years ago though and she \\*checks notes\\* still stayed with him the past 4 years through a pandemic and MARRIED him since then? And is now getting worked up enough about it that shes running to Reddit for validation?   \nLook, what he did was thoughtless but if she cannot let this go she will be the one destroying a relationship. I\u2019m not even sure why she has continued said relationship if she feels this one incident proves he can\u2019t be trusted in general. ESH to YTA.", "It doesn't matter. She'll remind him of it for decades afterwards, but now it will be in a comical fashion. My wife still brings up stuff from 25 years ago when we were dating. It'll probably be on my obituary if I keel off first. I'm fine with it it's truly water under the bridge. She just keeps showing the picture of the bridge. \n\nMen forget and don't forgive.

Did we read a different post or something? OP literally states *he gave a sincere apology and was forgiven*.\n\n> He follows me home, apologises profusely & I forgave him because he sounded sincere.\n\nExcept she\u2019s still holding it over his head, four years later.

I literally took back my cheating ex 2 times but 3rd time he really thought I would take his ass. Yes we can't control their actions nor it's easy to unlove someone or leave a relationship but you gotta put yourself first. I think it was from then on I realized I shouldn't stay with someone if I can't forgive them for something because it will hunt us. Just like OP she loves her husband which is why she married him but her keep bringing up that one incident is like so unfair too. If he's not changed still it's her fault to sticking with him it's not his fault cause he made it clear he's not here for change and her criticizing but also staying with him makes her AH but not AH for being upset over that incident but if she keeps bringing it up then she's a AH.", "Not just that but if this was enough of an issue that they'd clearly previously talked about it repeatedly - she obviously has a habit of calling him to interrupt when he's out with his friends, so much so that they had to discuss this in advance *again* before he went out on the evening in question - she clearly has an issue with demanding that he be constantly available to her, and calling him \"unreliable\" because he is trying not to indulge her need for control by answering when she knows he's busy is just another lever of that control.

She expected him to drive. \n\nAnd like I point out in my comment (which... I guess you stopped reading after I first wrote that he shouldn't be driving? Or maybe you only skimmed it?): He absolutely should have kept his phone on vibrate, so he would have noticed her calls coming in and would be able to pick up the phone.
