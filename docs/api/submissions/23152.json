I was actually at work about 30 mins away but left early at 11pm due to weather.My bf (34) of 1 yr (we\u2019re still together) was known to not answer calls/texts cuz it was rude if he was hanging out with his friends. Before I left I told him I was coming home early & that I was nervous about the drive. I asked him to please turn on his sound while at the bar since I was worried. He refused telling me I was controlling because he was out so I asked him to keep the phone face up and on vibrate so he could feel/see the call & he agreed.\n\nThe storm was insane, I could barely see in front of me and the cars had their hazards on. Them an 18 wheeler starts to lose control and they come barreling towards me so I swerve and drive full speed into the grass on the side of the highway. Thankfully the 18 wheeler was able to avoid hitting me but the driver didn\u2019t stop to check on me and make sure I was ok. While I wasn\u2019t physically hurt, I started to smell smoke and I jump out of the car afraid it was somehow damaged when I went off road. I grabbed my phone and jacket from the car to call my bf who was 15 mins away, to come and look at the car and make sure it was safe to drive. I call, no answer, and again. At some point I went from scared to mad. My car was still smoking and I was on the dark stretch of hwy. Eventually, the car stopped smoking and I checked it out myself and got back on the road. Instead of going home, I drove to the bar where he was. I called 20 times & I just got mad with each ring.I decided I was going to break up with him give him a piece of my mind.\n\nI pull into the parking lot and I can see that he\u2019s laughing with his friends and enjoying his beer and his phone is face down. I call him one last time to see if he was actively ignoring my calls and he doesn\u2019t even look down. I start to walk towards him and I swear I was so mad. At some point he looks to up see me walking toward him with a look that could cut. That\u2019s when he looks down at his phone & I could see the color drain from his face. At that point I didn\u2019t care if I embarrassed him so I apologize to his friends for the interruption but I have to drag him to the back of the outdoor bar to chew him out. Now, it\u2019s still raining & I tell him to fuck off since I\u2019d spent 20 mins in the rain & splashed by cars. He says he\u2019s not sure why I was mad, I wasn\u2019t hurt & he couldn\u2019t do much to help me anyways. I said I did have an emergency & he didn\u2019t answer. So I told him off & I leave back to my place to cry & take a warm shower. He follows me home, apologizes profusely & I forgave him because he sounded sincere. We are now married for 1.5 yrs & he says he\u2019s dependable & I bring up that night. He said that it wasn\u2019t bad since I wasn\u2019t injured.

As his partner, he should be prioritizing you over his social event especially in an emergency. I could see him ignoring you if you were constantly messaging asking what he was doing and who he was with. But this is very different. You maybe could have communicated better in the moment instead of \u201cchewing him out,\u201d but I totally understand you were in a heightened emotional state for the event itself and from being upset with him.", "Info: other than this one instance, what other examples do you have?

You were on a highway for 20 minutes in a storm in the dark, all it would take is ANOTHER accident or a flash flood (don't know if that's a concern for the area) for you to be dead. Thank god it was only 20 minutes, too. He's horrible for downplaying the situation and for not helping you, and I can't believe he's STILL trying to downplay it.
