I was actually at work about 30 mins away but left early at 11pm due to weather.My bf (34) of 1 yr (we\u2019re still together) was known to not answer calls/texts cuz it was rude if he was hanging out with his friends. Before I left I told him I was coming home early & that I was nervous about the drive. I asked him to please turn on his sound while at the bar since I was worried. He refused telling me I was controlling because he was out so I asked him to keep the phone face up and on vibrate so he could feel/see the call & he agreed.\n\nThe storm was insane, I could barely see in front of me and the cars had their hazards on. Them an 18 wheeler starts to lose control and they come barreling towards me so I swerve and drive full speed into the grass on the side of the highway. Thankfully the 18 wheeler was able to avoid hitting me but the driver didn\u2019t stop to check on me and make sure I was ok. While I wasn\u2019t physically hurt, I started to smell smoke and I jump out of the car afraid it was somehow damaged when I went off road. I grabbed my phone and jacket from the car to call my bf who was 15 mins away, to come and look at the car and make sure it was safe to drive. I call, no answer, and again. At some point I went from scared to mad. My car was still smoking and I was on the dark stretch of hwy. Eventually, the car stopped smoking and I checked it out myself and got back on the road. Instead of going home, I drove to the bar where he was. I called 20 times & I just got mad with each ring.I decided I was going to break up with him give him a piece of my mind.\n\nI pull into the parking lot and I can see that he\u2019s laughing with his friends and enjoying his beer and his phone is face down. I call him one last time to see if he was actively ignoring my calls and he doesn\u2019t even look down. I start to walk towards him and I swear I was so mad. At some point he looks to up see me walking toward him with a look that could cut. That\u2019s when he looks down at his phone & I could see the color drain from his face. At that point I didn\u2019t care if I embarrassed him so I apologize to his friends for the interruption but I have to drag him to the back of the outdoor bar to chew him out. Now, it\u2019s still raining & I tell him to fuck off since I\u2019d spent 20 mins in the rain & splashed by cars. He says he\u2019s not sure why I was mad, I wasn\u2019t hurt & he couldn\u2019t do much to help me anyways. I said I did have an emergency & he didn\u2019t answer. So I told him off & I leave back to my place to cry & take a warm shower. He follows me home, apologizes profusely & I forgave him because he sounded sincere. We are now married for 1.5 yrs & he says he\u2019s dependable & I bring up that night. He said that it wasn\u2019t bad since I wasn\u2019t injured. So I told him I was posting this on Reddit to ask, AITA?", "created_utc": 1690353702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159xw9f/aita_for_telling_my_husband_hes_unreliable_after/", "score": 730, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As his partner, he should be prioritizing you over his social event especially in an emergency. I could see him ignoring you if you were constantly messaging asking what he was doing and who he was with. But this is very different. You maybe could have communicated better in the moment instead of \u201cchewing him out,\u201d but I totally understand you were in a heightened emotional state for the event itself and from being upset with him.", "Info: other than this one instance, what other examples do you have?

You were on a highway for 20 minutes in a storm in the dark, all it would take is ANOTHER accident or a flash flood (don't know if that's a concern for the area) for you to be dead. Thank god it was only 20 minutes, too. He's horrible for downplaying the situation and for not helping you, and I can't believe he's STILL trying to downplay it.

If he started doing it because the someone was you, you lose the moral high ground here because you created the situation yourself. Does he at least agree that if/when you have children, he is going to have to answer calls from you because it could be an emergency with the kids? If you are the reason that he started switching the ringer off, you are going to have to agree to only call him when it is an emergency or something that won't wait until he comes home.\n\nKudos for dragging him to thee back of the bar for the chewing out, some people would  have done it in front of his buddies and that is a bad precedent to start off with in a relationship.\n\nWhy couldn't he have been kinder and gentler with you as he knew (presumably) that this was your first big flooding/super storm situation? Especially at 11pm - he knew it was dark, storming like crazy, and that you might encounter some flooded roadways while driving home! The very least he could have done was answer the phone and be supportive. Alternatively, he could have been a real gentleman and awesome bf by offering to come get you and drive you home or if leaving your car at work was not an option, he could have followed you home so that you could feel safer (not as good ad driving you but better than what he did).\n\nThis was not solely an \"Are you dependable?\" situation, it was a \"Are you rude and do not care about my fears and insecurity due to that being my first time driving here in a big super storm/flooding situation and you did not even try to help me or take my fears into account. Saying that it wasn't bad because you were not hurt so it doesn't count because you did not get hurt is not okay - he was not answering his phone and it could have been anything - you, telling him you had been involved in an accident and were in the ER, waiting to be seen by the doctor or it could been your parents trying to call him because they had received the phone call no parent every wants to receive, that you had been involved in an accident and had been declared dead at the scene, but he did not know because he did not answer his phone, not even after you asked him to do so because you were fearful of driving home from work in the storm. \n\nI think since he apologized sincerely and profusely and you married him, you need to let it go now and stop bringing it up. It is in the past and it sounds like he is trying so let him show you that he has improved and acknowledge his newer (hopefully) more considerate ways.  However, it would be a really great thing to have an agreement about how such situations  will be handled in the future - i.e. when he is out with his friends, you agree to only call if something is a true emergency and cannot wait until he gets home.

He absolutely should have kept his phone on vibrate and answered her calls, offered sympathy, advice, 'remote help', etc, but assuming he had indeed been drinking, he should under no circumstances have been driving.", "He \"ignored\" her calls because he literally didn't know they were coming in. It wasn't an active choice to ignore each and every call, as evidenced by his reaction when he finally turned his phone over and noticed the missed calls. While I agree that he should've had vibration on, his phone turned up, etc, so he didn't miss the calls, it's unfair to claim he was actively ignoring her every time she tried to contact him; that's just not true.\n\nI also have to admit that I'm a little bit confused as to what exactly she was expecting him to do about the situation. She knew he had been drinking. Is she advocating for putting a drunk driver on the road in the middle of a storm? That would only add more risk to everyone who was driving that night. With his phone on vibrate, he could've at least answered and talked to her, tried to help her calm down, give her advice on how to proceed, etc, but under no circumstance should he have been driving.\n\nAlso, he *did* apologize. Profusely and sincerely. OP specifies this in the post. She also specifies that she forgave him.", "She was at work? Was she supposed to stay at work all night lol", "OP specifies in her post that yes, he did apologize. Sincerely and profusely. And she forgave him.\n\nAlso, he was at a bar. Meaning he'd been drinking. He shouldn't have been driving at all. In fact, I'd call him more of an AH for following her home (presumably in a car) than for not driving out to get her from where she 'crashed' (for lack of a better word). He absolutely should have kept his phone on vibrate like he said he would, so he would've noticed her calls, answered, and maybe offered some other kind of support - but under no circumstance should he have been driving under the influence during a storm.", "I was confused why you said it\u2019s been 4 years when she said it happened in 2019. Man\u2026 it\u2019s been crazy.", "THANK YOU. No one is saying this. Also, I would bet the whole smoke from the car panic was over the top. She was obviously stressed and worried. The car was not on fire, possibly just scorched the grass or the engine was too hot. \n\nAlso, the one factor everyone is ignoring: he was out drinking with his friends. I hope she means 15 mins walk and not drive, because if so, she was wanting someone under the influence to get in their car and drive through the treacherous weather she describes to come to her? If it's just a 15 min walk, she should be expected to deal with it. Why does he have to travel to her when she isn't injured or in danger? Yeah, this is ridiculous.", "What a confusing, nonsensical comment", "I agree if he doesn't do that anymore. \n\nIf he still keeps up the behavior with  the phone when out with friends etc op has all the right in the world to remind him.", "I think OP might feel she still needs to bring it up because he never really properly acknowledged that he messed up that time. She was scared and he was completely dismissive to that. If he hasn\u2019t taken accountability or even felt sorry, what\u2019s stopping him from thinking it\u2019s okay to do it again since he feels he did nothing wrong? \n\nI think OP is bringing up this fear when the topic comes up and looking for reassurance. Him being dismissive about that incidence makes her feel the need to bring it up again. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t call OP an asshole for getting back together with him, we all know relationships and feelings are complex. \n\nAnd she\u2019s not the asshole for bringing up something that hasn\u2019t been resolved in hopes she\u2019ll get the reassurance she needs. I agree that she would be the asshole for continuously bringing it up AFTER he\u2019s apologized and take accountability for it though. \n\nNTA", "This is why she should have never married him in the first place. She never actually forgave him. She\u2019s had resentment toward him the start of the marriage, it\u2019s only going to get worse", "I don't get why they got married. OP says she(?) was going to break up with him that night. She's clearly never gotten over how unreliable and uncaring he is. Refusing to take your partner's calls during dangerous weather just because you're out drinking with your buddies is really not acceptable behavior.\n\nI also get why OP keeps bringing up the incident. The husband never apologized, he just keeps dismissing it because nothing really bad happened (though being terrified and outside with a crashed car during a storm does seem like a kind of bad consequence). So I'm going to go with NTA, but yeah it probably wasn't wise to marry this guy.", "I think questioning why she's still mad about it four years later is pretty valid tbh.", "This. I never understood why people are stuck in relationship they hate until I realized how hard it is to find someone that you can rely on.", "It's not always that. Some people are just really good at talking. It's called having a silver tongue for a reason. My ex-fiance was very good at managing to convince me to come back. He was very good at managing to convince me every single time that things would change, that he would get his s*** together, that he would stop drinking. And the worst part is, for a little bit each time he would! He would make an effort. And I saw what he could be. The kind of person that he was capable of being when he actually tried. The thing is, he just didn't want to keep trying. As soon as he knew he had me back in his clutches, he would revert right back to who he was. \n\nI wasted two and a half years on that man. I finally started seeing s*** straight two years in, and it's still took me 6 months to get out.\n\nSo no, it is not always that people are afraid they're going to end up alone. Sometimes we genuinely see the best in people and see who they can be and want to help them reach that potential. Sometimes we just don't want to give up on somebody that we put so much time and effort into, because we just don't want to start all over. Sometimes it's that we don't want to feel like we're abandoning somebody in their darkest moment. Sometimes it's that we don't want to feel like we're abandoning somebody who we love, and who we have seen grow so much in the relationship.\n\nThere are tons of reasons why somebody would end up getting back together with someone who's not good for them, and fear of loneliness is usually not the top one.", "Rule 9.", "If the most recent example of him being unreliable is from four years ago I'd actually say he's pretty reliable.\n\nMaking sweeping generalisations ('you never do this' or 'you always do that' or 'you're selfish/unreliable/uncaring') is like the first thing they tell you not to do in couples counselling. OP needs a bit of it.", "Yeah, this is someone who keeps score. We all know healthy relationships are built on a foundation of petty grievances.", "OP's only example of him *not* being dependable is that one incident. A single incident in which she called a boyfriend who she knows has been drinking, expecting him to get in a car and drive out to go get her, rather than calling some sort of professional like she definitely should have. Because driving under the influence is so dependable and super safe! ( /s, if it wasn't obvious)", ">OP\u2019s husband missed every step of making a proper apology \n\n???\n\nFrom the post:\n\n\"apologizes profusely\"\n\n\"sounded sincere\"\n\nI know we're all apology purists here but this is ridiculous.", "I feel like the smoke coming from the car would be enough of a reason to call the fire department?", "He was actively ignoring them as she asked him to be available if you say yes and then make yourself unavailable you are ignoring calls", "He was DRINKING with his friends. Was he supposed to pick her up?", "It's a bit much but AAA does exist.", "If he still keeps up the behavior, OP should leave him because he isn't going to change \n\nIf he has changed, she needs to leave this in the past", "Because he never acknowledged any wrongdoing and still refers to himself as \u201cdependable.\u201d We have no reason to believe that he would behave any differently if the scenario happened tonight.\n\nEdit to add: it IS fairly annoying that the OP claims to have forgiven him only to bring it up regularly.", "But how can you win the marriage if you don't jeep socre??!1!!\n\n\n/s", "She knows he's dependable but doesn't feel it.", "Yeah, but I mean I would be pissed if my partner didn\u2019t even pick up his phone when I am distressed, so it\u2019s not only that. He could as well talk her down a bit and call her an Uber and a tow truck, instead of driving to her.\n\nLike I never call my partner when he is out with his friends, but if there was an emergency and he wouldn\u2019t pick up\u2026 I could not be with someone like that.", "No, cars rarely catch fire like this. If she was having engine trouble or something and it was massively overheating and she had been driving it for hours then there\u2019s a possibility. But just swerving across the road? No way.", "If she drove in to the grass it was almost definitely the heat from her engine scorching the grass. There wasn't a fire because it was still so wet.", "No a car on fire would be", "I agree that he should've made himself more available. But that's not the same as actively ignoring each individual call. He missed her calls, because he chose to make himself hard to reach and then seemingly forgot to check his phone as often as he probably should have. Still not the same as ignoring them. I'm in no way defending his choice to turn off sound and vibration and place his phone face down, especially since they had agreed on what seems like a pretty fair compromise (keeping the vibrations on and the phone facing up). He essentially made himself unavailable, which is a very crappy thing to do - but \"ignoring\" her calls would mean he noticed them coming in and chose not to answer, which we know isn't what happened.", "Idk why you're going at me when the only thing I've pointed out is that the above commenter asked if the woman HAD to drive that night and she definitely did, unless she could stay the night at work. \n\nI don't have a strong principled opinion about the situation she describes. I think he was a dick for refusing to have his volume on but once he started drinking there were no good, practical solutions either way. Personally if I knew my partner had never driven in the rain before, much less flooding, (and I did have a partner like this, and offered to drive him home) I would be very worried and would want to check in at the very least, so I don't really understand his behavior. But \ud83e\udd37. That's why she married him and I wouldn't.", "I know what you meant but for some reason \u201cJeep socre\u201d made me laugh", "I absolutely agree that he should've kept his phone on vibrate like they discussed, and should've picked up. But calling an Uber and a tow truck, those are things she could easily do herself, honestly. I'd even go as far as to say they are things she *should* be doing herself - both to learn how to deal with emergencies on her own (let's face it, no matter who we go out with, we can't, and shouldn't, rely on them to always fix all our issues), and because she has a much better grasp on where exactly she is, making it far easier for her to get these vehicles to her exact location instead of \"some place along the road\". \n\nOf course, none of this changes the fact that he should have been available to talk her down and help her calm down a bit, maybe even help her realize that although it was certainly a stressful situation, it was (fairly) unlikely to become a dangerous one. I'm not saying he's in any way perfect or blameless - merely pointing out that in the moment, she had unrealistic, unfair, even dangerous expectations, that he couldn't and shouldn't live up to, and that she seems to have clung to those expectations in the numerous years since, despite his sincere and profuse apologies, and despite her forgiving him for it.", "Right, so should my car ever begin to smoke I'll wait until there's actual fire to call the fire department, got it.", "I dont know why you think im going at you.  I responded in an equally minimal and nonoffensive way.", "Yes, that is actually correct, most cars that are \"smoking\" aren't on fire.", "Well, yeah. You don't call the fire department for a smoky kitchen when you scorch food, do you?", "She didn\u2019t crash, the car wasn\u2019t overheating before she drove off the road, it was raining. She didn\u2019t even see smoke, she just smelled it. The car was not on fire.", "A good first step would be finding out where the smoke is coming from.", "Buddy, cars smoke all the time. Sometimes even if there isnt anything majorly wrong with it. It's 90% of the time not from fire. You'll know right away if there is one. You can tell what kind of smoke it is based on color.", "Correct lol", "Hey buddy, I think you didn\u2019t get what people are saying. It\u2019s extremely hard for a car to get on fired, they can get overheated by that it creates a smoke.
