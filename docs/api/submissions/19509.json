That making memories with you is more important than his comfort. \n\nI can see why you would react poorly to those words in your grief. It's a flippant way of conveying something that may very well be a much deeper realization. \n\nI'm so sorry about your mom's passing. That's never easy. But be gentle with yourself and with him.
