I did try and help both of them through it.  To summarize, I spoke with my daughter to make her aware that what she said affected her brother in a bad way even though her intentions weren't malice.  Even though they were close before this happened, they have never made an effort to mend the indifference because my son will never forgive her and she said what she did wasn't intentional.\n\nThis has made for very uncomfortable situations any time we have family get togethers.

My sister and I are not a good match. We don't hate eachother but honestly I'm happy I don't have to do stuff with her. I just can't stand her. We have decades of bad encounters. We were never a good match. And we never will be. Family get togethers are torture for me. I go but I don't like it. \n\nAnd I assume it's just the same with your kids. This incident would not have been a breaking point if they had a good relationship prior to that. They would've reconciled on their own. I mean 10 years is a lot.

The fact that she doesn\u2019t feel ANY remorse shows that she\u2019s probably a daddy\u2019s girl. Maybe homophobic? And probably has NEVER gotten along with brother.

People come out or not when they choose.

She hurt him (even if it was originally unintentional, which I\u2019m not completely convinced it was if she regularly makes nasty comments about her brother), and she\u2019s apparently never apologized or acknowledged that she screwed up. Until and unless she does that, and also stops with the insults and inconsiderate comments, it\u2019s only reasonable that your son doesn\u2019t want to be around her. He\u2019d be perfectly justified in refusing to forgive her even if she did apologize and try to make amends, and since she hasn\u2019t, it only makes sense for  him to protect himself.\n\nIf you really want to try and fix things, you should tell your son that you understand his feelings, you\u2019re very disappointed in your daughter and sorry she\u2019s been so awful to him, and reassure him that you won\u2019t try to make him be around her (and if only one of them can come to an event, consider just flat out uninviting her and explicitly giving him priority). \n\nAs for your daughter, tell her that you\u2019re disappointed in her actions over the years and (if you really want to give it one last try) that you wish she would apologize to her brother and take responsibility for the rupture between them (but know that she probably won\u2019t). Say that you\u2019re through \u201cnot taking sides\u201d because she was/is the one in the wrong.

She's since then failed to apologize or acknowledge that she's done wrong.\n\nAnd even now, your daughter says \"inconsiderate things\" about her brother.\n\nLet me be very clear here. Your daughter is 100% in the wrong and your son is 100% in the right. And as long as you try to say that they both have a point or they're both equally wrong, what you're *really* doing is choosing your daughter over your son. Because they're not equally wrong!

Continue having separate occasions.\n\nI'm really tempted to go ahead and give you that Y T A because your framing makes it sounds like you think the two offenses, such as they are, are equal - but looking at your behavior in this post, I guess not. So N T A, barely. But if you do not play this very carefully your son will cut contact with you as well.\n\nEdit: Actually, looking at this post there appear to be a lot of deleted comments.

And no, I will not step foot in a funeral home for him either. \n\nMaybe your children haven\u2019t fought to that extent, but the hurt is there, and only your son can be the one to allow the relationship to mend in the future, if his sister doesn\u2019t make it worse in the meantime. \n\nBut YTA if you keep forcing it.

It sounds a lot like you're just trying to be mediator instead of holding misbehaving people accountable.\n\nIf someone makes inconsiderate comments they need to be asked to apologize or leave. Period. You can warn them ahead of time.\n\nI say all this not to scare you. But so that you can see one of the angles your son may be coming from.
