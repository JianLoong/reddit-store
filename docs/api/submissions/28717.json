And what kind of comments are we talking of? \n\nTo actually want that your kids get along well is very normal I suppose. And although they are adults you still have some influence on them I suppose. Afterall you're their mom. So do you bring in this influence to guide them gently in the right direction? Or how should mending their relationship look like? \n\nIdeally you should've raised your kids in a way that they don't make inconsiderate comments about eachother anyways. And ideally you raise them so that they don't cross boundaries or at least appologize if they did something wrong. \n\nSo I suppose you're having issues that run a bit deeper.

It\u2019s a huge betrayal of trust.", "Yes, YTA\n\nThey are not props in your life. They are actual people with their own emotional experiences. Honestly, your daughter is a dick and has taken no responsibility for the despicable way she has betrayed her brother's trust. \n\nBut all you care about is how much easier your life would be if they could just do what you want and make you happy.

Explain how regardless of her intentions, that that\u2019s NOT something for her to disclose? Sounds like you just let your kids do their own thing. Which is fine to a certain degree (They are adults after all). But if you care about the relationship between them, you would at least try to mediate. It sounds like you don\u2019t care about their relationship to each other, just their relationship as it relates to you.", "Well if it's been ten years. Honestly I think this ship has sailed. \n\nAnd yes kids are people who don't always follow their parents example and don't always share same world views and ethics. \n\nI think it's like your son doesn't want to meet his sister as she did and said awful things. This is understandable and you just have to respect this. You can't make your daughter appologize and even if you could it's not given that your son will forgive his sister. \n\nYou could express how it makes you feel that you can't have normal family celebrations. But there's a fine line here between talking about your feelings and trying to guilttrip them into family events. \n\nAs a mother I understand how it deeply hurts to see them fight and not getting along. \n\nHowever, as a sibling I can understand all too well that you can't force a good relationship with siblings. My sister and I are not a good match. We don't hate eachother but honestly I'm happy I don't have to do stuff with her. I just can't stand her. We have decades of bad encounters. We were never a good match. And we never will be. Family get togethers are torture for me. I go but I don't like it. \n\nAnd I assume it's just the same with your kids. This incident would not have been a breaking point if they had a good relationship prior to that. They would've reconciled on their own. I mean 10 years is a lot. If they chose to go separate ways for so long the indiscretion about your sons sexual orientation was probably only the last straw.", "Is it really both of them, though? Your daughter outed your son. And to this day badmouths him. Has there been any contrition on your daughters\u2019 part? If not, there\u2019s zero incentive for your son to want any contact. \n\nAnd really, there\u2019s nothing to reconcile. Reconciliation implies that both parties need to acknowledge wrongdoing. But the wrong seems to be coming from one side of the fence, and it\u2019s not your sons\u2019. If your daughter refuses to speak to you for a week because you called her out on her hurtful bullshit, she has a lot work to do. You can wish all you want for a united family, but you\u2019re not going to get it until she turns herself around.", "I don't even think he necessarily doesn't want them to be closer, I think he wants a fucking apology.", "How do you, in your head see that happening though? Realistically. You say you know your son is not at fault and is the one wronged\u2026 so are you putting it all on your daughter to repair the rift? Or are you expecting your son to \u201cforgive\u201d and \u201cmove on\u201d. \n\nAnd honestly\u2026 even though she\u2019s been no contact for years your daughter has recently started bad mouthing your son\u2026 out of the blue\u2026 for no reason? But you think there\u2019s a chance you can ask them to get along? Do you REALLY think your daughter cares to even try? She\u2019s literally shredded your family and her relationship with her brother rather than be willing to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you but I now see I did anyway. Forgive me.\u201d Like, that\u2019s all she needed to do but instead she chose this route. \n\nTheir relationship is never repairing because your daughter would rather tear your family apart than be wrong.\n\nI don\u2019t think you are an ah to wish for it, but I think you need to be realistic about what is and isn\u2019t fair to actually ask of\u2026 your son at least.", "I don't think your AH for wanting things to change, but until she realises why she was in the wrong, I don't see it happening. You can't expect your son to just forgive and move on without any effort from her.", "yes I have.  And she didn't talk to me for a week for calling her out on it.", "Of course I did.  I updated the OP to talk about that.", "Thank you for not just jumping to conclusions.  I appreciate your understanding and sharing some of your story.  This has helped me.", "There you go then.\n\nYour daughter is not ready to admit what she did (and continues to do) is wrong.\n\nAnd your son shouldn't be expected to let it go. He was wronged and continues to be wronged. He's gracious enough to come around to see you even with her there. You can't ask more from him. Especially not when your daughter hasn't stopped.\n\nSo either let the two figure it out without your meddling. And hope for the best. \n\nOr make peace with the fact that their relationship is forever damaged. And that you'll never get your Norman Rockwell style family gathering. \n\nOr keep calling out your daughter every time she's an a-hole to him. And put up with her sulking and tantrums, hoping that some day you'll get through to her. And that when you do, at some point your son will be ready for a relationship with her. But even if she changes, it's not guaranteed your son will want anything to do with her. Seems like she's done too much damage already. \n\nDO NOT put any of this on your son.\n\nEdited.", "Maybe it\u2019s just the little that you wrote, but it doesn\u2019t sound like there was much conviction in you when you addressed it. If you REALLY want to hit the idea home with her, talk to her again. Maybe put it in terms that she can understand. \n\nFor example: Imagine if she got pregnant; is that news for the brother to spread around? No! She would be upset and probably find it hard to forgive. \n\nIf she loved her brother at all, she should want to protect him and respect him. The fact that she doesn\u2019t feel ANY remorse shows that she\u2019s probably a daddy\u2019s girl. Maybe homophobic? And probably has NEVER gotten along with brother. Or feels like his pain is justified because of some offense he did to her. All of this is just speculation though. That is stuff you need to talk through and figure out between you and her. The brother is 100% justified at cutting her off for this. He deserves an honest apology for that."]}
