They separated and divorced while he was in prison. She boxed up the majority of his stuff and stored it in our grandpa's basement. I was around 10 years old at the time and knew she did this as I remember helping her. Some of the belongings were expensive, irreplaceable or sentimental. \n\nWhen he got out of prison and asked about his belongings she told him she trashed and sold all his stuff. Her ex is a good family friend and still close with all our family and best friend's with one of my brothers. I was close to him as a kid and he remains someone important in my life. He brought up his lost possessions frequently and made comments about certain items. I never told him where his stuff really was and I think I was the only person other than my sister that knew/remembered. This was in part my way of silently punishing him for screwing over my sister. I never thought much about it or felt bad.\n\nRecently my grandpa found his stuff while organizing his basement. He called him up and told him to come get it not realising it had been hidden from him. He was mad to find out he had been lied to for years but also happy to find the majority of personal items weren't lost forever. My sister claims she would have told him about his belongings once he paid back money he owed her and suitably made up for making her raise 3 boys on her own for 7+ years.\n\nWhen I saw him a few days ago I let slip that I had known the truth about where his stuff was. I didn't think he'd be that mad at me, he's normally quite understanding about my brothers and I giving him shit in relation to our sister. He was very angry at me and said lying to him about his stuff crossed a line. He's specifically mad because of a few of the sentimental items that he thought he lost and I agree that it was unfair to keep it from him for so long but part of me thinks he deserved it.\n\nA couple of my brothers agree that I was an arsehole for keeping this from him.

Ex is an AH because he broke the law and got sent to prison. He did something which forced him to abandon his family.\n\nNext, your family. This man devastated your sister and ruined their life together, yet you all seem to be in some kind of Fast & Furious budget movie constantly saying that he's a good guy and he's \"family.\" His constant moaning about losing his stuff to your family, despite he harm he caused one of you, is completely lacking consideration and empathy.\n\nYour sister, she's a justified AH. She married someone that she thought she could trust, someone the whole family was close to. She thought they'd be together for the rest of their lives and raise a family together and he betrayed her. It wasn't *right* that she hid his things, it was an AH move to lie, but she *didn't* throw them away.\n\nThen, there's you, OP. You hid the truth from someone you say is a great friend and like family. You could have done almost anything else. You could have told him that his stuff was still around, it would betray your sister but it would stop you from lying. You could have gone to your sister and told her that you weren't comfortable hiding it, give her time to make it right on her own. You could even have lied a different way and pointed out the weird boxes in grandpa's basement, what are those I wonder? Instead you did nothing, and now everyone knows the truth of that.", "YTA and NTA you were being loyal to your sister. No one can blame you for that. Yes it was a crappy move but his stuff was safe and he got it all back. He may be hurt but he's the one who went away so he should be grateful that his stuff is still around.", "100% this.
