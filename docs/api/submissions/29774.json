A son: Liam (15) from a random hookup, and one more kid from a long term relationship. My brother has a daughter as well. From what he tells me, Liam is the only one without an active dad and the only one that lives with them full time as my biological niece primarily lives with her mom. \n\nI assumed Liam living with them full time meant he would get quite a bit of attention but my niece told me that they all seem to forget about him. She has told me that her step mom once said that Liam is the \u201cextra\u201d and not as \u201ccute\u201d as her other kids. Apparently it was a joke\u2026 \n\nAnyways, Tori invited the whole family over for dinner. At one point they told us all to gather round and Tori told us she\u2019s pregnant. Everyone started cheering, I\u2019ll admit, I was too. \n\nBut my niece drew my attention to Liam who started crying and walked off. Niece and I followed him and when I asked him if everything was okay he started crying in my arms. I felt sooo terrible. My niece then took him out for ice cream to cheer him up while I went back to the others. \n\nThey were all very preoccupied and my brother started talking to one of our nephews (NOT Tori\u2019s kids). This nephew then tells us that while he did not make a team, Liam did. My brother was quite surprised because he\u2019s a huge fan of this sport and had no clue Liam was interested as he always thought he was a quieter, nerdy kid. This nephew sorta laughed and said Liam is not a quiet nerdy kid, the opposite actually. He\u2019s very popular at school.\n\nAfter finishing his conversation with the nephew, he approached me and said \u201cMaybe nephew\u2019s confused, Liam\u2019s not that type of kid.\u201d\n\nI asked him what kind of kid he thinks Liam is. My brother said that he doesn\u2019t talk to Liam much but according to Tori, he\u2019s \u201csocially awkward,\u201d \u201csensitive,\u201d and \u201ca little needy.\u201d Tori overheard and was like \u201cLiam? Is he bothering you? Next time he tries to talk to you run or else he\u2019ll never leave you alone\u2026 he really is needy.\u201d \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. Especially after how much Liam cried earlier. I told Tori and my brother that they should be ashamed of themselves. I then specifically told Tori that she should\u2019ve kept her legs closed if she didn\u2019t want \u201cneedy\u201d children. Obviously my brother kicked me out which I deserved. But Tori is furious and keeps sending me messages about how rude I am and how I don\u2019t know anything about her etc. I even got yelled at by my mom.

Telling someone to keep their legs closed is going to shut the conversation down pretty quickly thereby not achieving the goal of your conversation.", "They sound like pricks tbh.

A better play would\u2019ve been to get the facts on Liam\u2019s athletic accomplishments and pass them along to your brother and his wife, along with a mild jab about they don\u2019t really know much about him.  ESH", "NTA for pointing out legit ABUSE and NEGLECT.  I hope you follow through with them and I hope you have some resources for Liam.", "NTA I don't think, your brother needs a wake up call about how terrible of a father he and how deplorable his wife have been. Good on you and your niece for supporting him, he seems to need someone who is going to call out this horrible treatment for him.", "ESH - Liam is sadly being dealt the consequences of poor decisions and incredible social neglect from his \"parents\". Though, while I appreciate your compassion for him, there are much better ways of handling this situation. The \"keeping your legs closed\" comment was very unnecessary, letting them know you were ashamed of them was more than enough. \n\nYour brother definitely needs to step it up, though. He doesn't talk to Liam much? For goodness sake, they live together. Even if Liam has said he wouldn't see your brother as a father figure, does your brother just not interact with him at all? That's... disheartening at best.", "Nta , you only said what everyone else is thinking.  I feel sorry for Liam . Shame on his mother for making him feel worthless. Wanting love and affection as well as acceptance from your mother doesn't make him needy.  Your brother ans his wife are both the assholes .", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If that makes sense. Lol Sounds like that kid got a raw deal in the mother department. Her or your brother obviously don't pay attention or know him at all. Which is sad. Not only that, but the way she talks about him in such a negative way. Not cool. I'm glad you stuck up for him.", "ESH (or at least, the adults). Your brother and SIL for treating Liam poorly. But your comment was out of line. It had nothing to do with how they\u2019re treating him now, it was only about how he was conceived. Slut-shaming your SIL isn\u2019t the solution. And it closed the door on any potential you had for talking to them and getting them to change how they behave towards Liam.", "Poor Liam. He's already neglected by your brother and his mom and now a new baby will come in and take all the attention. They don't even know he plays sports?  I was very much on your side until the legs closed comment. That was an AH thing to say. Also you said lots of step kids but I only read 2? Gotta go with ESH cause it's a bit of a hot mess.", "NTA", "I'd say ESH, but you are the least asshole here. Your brother and his wife are huge assholes here. \n\nIf you can, spend some time with Liam, he sounds like a great kid whit a shit mother and stepfather.", "NTA for standing up for a neglected child but YTA for the legs closed comment.  Comments like that from men are a deal breaker because it is insight into the way you think about women.\n\nI notice you didn't mention the origins of your niece's conception, but you managed to get a shot in there about Tori's 'random hook up'.  Gross. YTA.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Tori is punishing her own son because she doesn't like that he wasn't conceived in a more stable relationship. She quite literally meant it when she called him the extra. \n\nIf possible, stay in contact with Liam. He needs an adult who actually cares about him.", "Your niece is a gem for noticing &telling you about Liam's treatment. You need to sit down with your brother & SIL (maybe with your niece there) and tell them what happened at the party. Or at least talk to your brother. I can't believe he is so blind & doesn't see what happens to Liam in his own house. Can you sound more time with Liam? Poor kid.\n\nNTA", "NTA -- unfortunately some people bristle when their questionable behavior is called to account.\n\nTori sounds like the type that will just keep having kids without any regard to how they should be raised or treated. Despicable behavior, really. Sounds like your doofus brother is perfectly willing to go along with this.", "You were nicer than I would have been.\n\nNTA", "4 step kids. Two from first marriage, Liam, then one more. There\u2019s 5 kids overall including niece, well 6 now I guess. \n\nBut yeah, I get it. I don\u2019t feel too proud of myself.", "Fair, I\u2019m a woman myself so I definitely do feel like an asshole for saying such a thing but I don\u2019t feel bad enough to apologize yet. \n\nAnd as for Liam, I\u2019ll see what I can do. I don\u2019t want to make him uncomfortable. Niece told me he has a couple games coming up and that we should go watch so I will be doing that and work from there.", "Tori is that type, though I don\u2019t want to say it. She couldn\u2019t really afford all those kids until my brother came into the picture. Thankfully, her 3 other kids had their dads so they didn\u2019t suffer too much due to her bad financial decisions but Liam only had his mom. My brother is an idiot. It used to be endearing but now he\u2019s genuinely just stupid to me.", "I'd say going to his games is a great way to show him you support and care for him. Also, offering to take him to lunch/dinner with your niece after the games would be a good way to bond as well and possibly get him to open up a bit, if he's comfortable with it."]}
