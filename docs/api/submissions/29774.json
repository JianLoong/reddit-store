My niece then took him out for ice cream to cheer him up while I went back to the others. \n\nThey were all very preoccupied and my brother started talking to one of our nephews (NOT Tori\u2019s kids).

I would not be surprised if she made other comments about him to his face that are particularly hurtful. Your brother is an asshole for not learning more about this child who does not have a father figure in his life and clearly doesn\u2019t have much of a mother either. Both of them are not very bright for getting pregnant when they already have a total of five children that they are taking care of between the two of them, and a couple of them have additional parents they have to coparent with.

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever an acceptable thing to say to a mother, and it definitely was not what you meant because you probably wanted to say something else, which is the only reason I\u2019m saying that wasn\u2019t OK and that was an asshole moment.

I think you need to tell them both that if the other nephew knows him at school, and says what he says, they ought to pay attention. They basically ignore him, and the reason he was so upset is that he knew that with the pregnancy he is definitely not going to get any attention from either of them going forward.

It's sexist and gross to phrase it as her needing to \"keep her legs together.\"\n\nEvery time you slut shame her (which is what that was), you might be scoring points against her, but you are *absolutely* scoring points against Liam. After all, he's the child she conceived from a hookup. I understand that you were trying to say that she shouldn't have a baby (who will be very needy) if she can't handle the needs of her existing children, but it really comes off more like \"well of course you have a kid you hate; you're a slut.\" Idk if Liam was there when this happened but you need to make sure you're not accidentally calling him a slutspawn when you're trying to defend him.\n\nGoing to point out also that I doubt your nieces would have heard that as \"I'm criticizing your parenting\" but rather \"OP is not a safe person to come to if I have problems with a partner because they think a woman should keep her legs shut\"\n\nIt's also just kind of a gross comment in general tbh. Tori doesn't suck because she's a slut (and I'm sorry, for all we know she had sex 4 times and sucks at birth control, you are reaching here); she sucks because she is a terrible mother who has given up on loving her first child. Your righteous anger speaks well of you and your love for your nephew, but you need to aim your shots better if you GAF about friendly fire.", "ESH, even though your anger was justified. There were much more productive things that you could have thrown in her face rather than slut shaming her. If you insulted her parenting she would be pissed but a small part of her might know it's true, but in her mind slut shaming her probably says more about you than her. Basically rather than telling her her parenting was bad, the misbehavior you pointed out was having sex and keeping the child 15 years ago. You might as well have said \"if you don't want a needy kid you should have aborted him!\", which conveys the same meaning but sounds truly awful doesn't it?\n\nI also don't like that you give your brother a free pass in the comments. Liam was so clearly hurt that he burst into tears hugging someone he doesn't know very well, how can you honestly think that someone living in the same home with him has never noticed those feelings? Your brother decided to marry this woman with her kids, and is being an equally absentee parent to a teen living under his roof. \n\nThe fact that you noticed a very real and tangible problem but instead of verbalizing that your go to insult was to slut shame her, as well as the fact that you give your brother a free pass on this shared behavior, kind of smells like internalized misogyny to me. Acting like tori is solely responsible and a slut when 3/4 of her kids were born in supposedly stable relationships feels like a preconceived notion. An unlucky woman can have sex 5 times and have 5 children, yet we don't regularly tell men to stop having sex, your brother is equally responsible for the newest child. She should be ashamed of her awful parenting and someone needs to tell her about it, but insulting her about her life circumstances, regardless of how at fault she may be for them, does not do that.\n\nBut with all that said I'm glad you stood up for Liam. I hope, if that means more fights with his parents, you will make them more productive. Thanks for being there for a kid in need.", "Wow. Your brother and his wife are lucky all you said was that she should have kept her legs closed. I would have told them that what Liam needs is actual parents!

His supposed mother is literally training all available adults to purposely neglect him as he has no value because he\u2019s \u201cneedy\u201d. \n\nI would have told her that hopefully sixth time the charm and maybe this time she\u2019ll learn how to be a good mother\u2026or maybe her being a good mother was giving them to their dads. Tell your brother he needs to be a better man. His daughter obviously turned out great from living with her mom because he has shit the bed with the one kid that is actively living in the home he\u2019s providing. So sad.

The entire situation that Tori has with her five kids is ridiculous. At a certain point of having that many children, there are bound to be some kids that think that she's going to forget about them or that she's replacing them.

Think of how embarrassed he'd be to have an announcement that he'd run away crying when he found out his mother was giving him another sibling!  No 15 year old (girl or boy) would want to have their emotions made a matter of discussion in the middle of a family gathering.\n\nFor his sake, you need to handle this matter with great discretion.  Speak to him about it only privately, away from any chance that anyone in the family, or any of his friends, might overhear.  Follow his lead about what he's comfortable with.  Things like going to his games might be awkward for him.  It's easy to make an excuse that your parents are busy with the other kids, but harder to explain why your parents are absent but your aunt or uncle is there.  \n\nI didn't catch where you live.  But if you are in the US, he's close to the age where kids start learning to drive.  I strongly suspect your brother and SIL will neglect teaching him.  A good way to start may be to gift him driving lessons for his 16th birthday.  Arrange so you take him to the lessons.  You can practice-drive with him, as well.  And stopping for a meal or snack on the way to or from driving lessons would be a natural thing to do, a way to meet with him without making it obvious to your brother and SIL that you are speaking with him behind their back.  You're just taking care of his birthday present of driving lessons.  The idea that he could drive younger kids to school or activities might reconcile them to the idea of lessons - just talk to him about it before mentioning anything to them, and make it clear you don't expect him to do so, but that it might help with getting them to sign off on any permissions needed.\n\nAnother possible gift might be a decent bike, if he doesn't have one.  It can greatly increase his range for independent travel.  It can put jobs in reach, that might not be accessible via walking or public  transit. \n\nHe may not be able to get a bank account on his own at his age, and I would not trust your brother or SIL with his money.  Signing as an adult with him on a joint account might be possible, and a way to keep his money safe.\n\nBasically, I expect your brother and SIL to neglect any preparation he needs for adulthood.  They will either kick him out, with nothing, at 18, or expect him to stay home and help support his siblings.  Anything you can do to help him be ready to move on his own - getting a job, learning to manage his own transportation, saving money, etc. would be extraordinarily useful to him.", "Brother and wife are garbage bag people, no doubt.
