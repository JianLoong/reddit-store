So I said \"I don't debate with Christians\"  I know that she believed in magic, which be honest that's what Christians believe, and I'm not gonna have a scientific debate with someone who believes in magic. I'm sorry if that offends you, but I'm not gonna talk about facts with someone who has faith. I'm cool with you if your Christian, believe what you want to believe, and I'll still debate about history or math or chemistry, but I'm not gonna debate about evolution and the big bang with a Christians, and I decided to make that clear. She didn't even look faded, but my mother interjected by saying my name in a stern tone, but I kept debating with my atheist friend and the Christian friend talked with somebody else. I get she might have felt left out but she had no place in this conversation and while I do feel bad, I know the conversation would have just devolved into arguments over faith and would have stopped all momentum in the conversation by saying \"I don't want to have this conversation\" and I did still like talking about aliens, so I predicted that would happen and just nipped the problem in the bud.

If you accept evolution or if you can debate with the premise of it being true you are welcome to join. Otherwise we can discuss evolution another time, sry.\" \n\nAlso having someone argue with you who is critical of your stance yet following it in a discussion can be very beneficial (if they can stick to the premise).\n\nSo you are not obliged to change the topic for them and if they fail to hold the premise of evolution you can still shut them down.", "YTA\n\nYou were incredibly condescending to a friend because they have a faith and demonstrated how close minded you are.

Both theories will continue to be challenged and built upon until centuries from now they're barely recognizable.

If you don\u2019t even understand something that basic how are you even gonna have a debate. If we are really gonna go with evolution is a theory and say I don\u2019t believe in theories why do you even believe in your religion? It\u2019s not a theory, it doesn\u2019t even qualify as an hypothesis. Theories don\u2019t exists without compelling evidence. Religion is purely based on faith, a book written by ancient people who probably didn\u2019t even know how to explain the most basic natural phenomenons. I cannot disprove or prove the existence of a God but I surely can determine for myself that organised religion is nothing more than a man made concept. I wonder if we will ever see the day (probably not in my lifetime) where humanity abandons organised religion completely.\n\nNo YTA Christian you would have been talking to a wall and you saved yourself some pain", "YTA.

You were just unnecessarily aggro right off the bat.", "Problem with arguing with any faith group about scientific matters is that they expect you to change your mind but they aren't willing to change their's. They use science to show you their beliefs are right and rational. But you can't use science to show their beliefs are irrational and wrong because their backstop is their faith (or concept of ethics) is more important than science. Fair enough but creates a very uneven slope I don't want to be on.\n\nIn this case though, you were pretty rude at a social event. Someone tried to join in a conversation and you shut them down. I will say she was rude too, taking conversation at a tangent. Polite thing would be to do small talk so as to include everyone and resume alien chat later.

If she brought up her religion and also said \"evolution is just a theory\" it's obvious she was going to go the intelligent design route. Also, if she believes in magic she's inconsistent in her beliefs, so she likely can't hold a fruitful debate. I'll admit my bias, I'm also an atheist and I think believing in a religion, especially the abrahamic ones, is a limitation on intelligence. But had she not brought up christianity and said evolution is just a theory and maybe aliens didn't evolve but came into being in some way we can't imagine then it would've been worth the conversation, but it sounds like she was just trying to discount evolution.", "YTA, \nEvolution (The Big Bang) is still a theory. It\u2019s just one that makes sense to you and what you believe. \n\nYou made assumptions based on someone\u2019s religion that makes you a bigot. Doesn\u2019t matter what religion they are. Almost every religion believes in some form of paranormal beings and science. Which has nothing to do with someone\u2019s view on how we all came about. \n\nYou were condescending, insulting, and disrespectful all to someone you call your friend. \n\nNot sure how you define a friend but if you want to keep them, you may want to check your ego at the door. \nI highly doubt they were going to try and save your soul during a conversation of paranormal science.", "Edit: judgement\n\nPrevious- YTA\nUpdated- NTA. I don\u2019t believe the action of declining to debate was the issue however, the way you expressed it was\n\nYou are argumentative and close minded so I am not understanding why you posted here. Are you seeking validation? If you aren\u2019t willing to discuss why you shut down their perspective there is no reason to judge because none of us can convince you that you were wrong. Upon reading some of these comments as well I do believe you are very hypocritical. You advised that one should not partake in conversations for something they \u201csimply don\u2019t believe\u201d however you did that to an extent with faith.\n\nThat being said, the big bang theory is just that, a theory. Not everyone who is religious denies science. You made that assumption without even hearing from the person of christian faith. I believe that shutting down one\u2019s opinion just means you are insecure about your ability to participate in conversation and genuine debates.", "YTA, \u2018i don\u2019t debate with christians\u2019 is not only rude, because you excluded someone from a discussion, which is hurtful, but it also shows that you are narrow minded, egocentric and gifted with very very bad conversational and social qualities", "ESH. \n\nNot debating with her because she's refusing to stick to the subject under discussion is one thing. She was absolutely in the wrong to try and shoehorn in the (totally incorrect) \"evolution is just a theory\" argument, not least because if you have any knowledge of science, you know that anything classified as a \"theory\" has serious weight of evidence behind it; far more weight than the casual non-scientific use of the word implies. And that's one of the first things that non-scientists get caught on: \"just a theory\" is a giveaway that you don't know what you're talking about.\n\nHowever. Not debating with her because you have decided that her faith is \"believing in magic\" is also wrong. Plenty of Christians (and other faiths) believe in evolution. Plenty of notable scientists are Christian (or other faiths). They don't see faith and science as incompatible, but merely as answers that arise from different questions. How = science. Where = geography. When = history. Why = philosophy/theology. (And yes, that's a gross generalisation, but the point stands.) Your assumption that only atheists are capable of a rational view on science is bigoted. And no you plainly aren't \"cool with\" believers if you have written an entire category of people off as not worth debating.\n\nI can't blame you for not wanting to debate with this girl.
