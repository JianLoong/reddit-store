We see each other for Christmas or big family events sometimes but he's quite a workaholic so we don't really talk much. He dropped David off with us for a day since he had meetings the entire time.\n\nI (33F) live with my wife (Caroline - 35F) and our twins (Harry 8M and Maeve 8F). While David was with us we tried to make the visit as fun as we could. We had a mini pool party together, threw a dance party, and played video games.\n\nAfter Caroline was home we went out to a restaurant all together and got David a few things as we did for our twins while we went shopping on the way back. Overall, it was a great experience for cousins to bond and David was a sweetheart. Michael picked him up and thanked us for everything.\n\nThe next week Michael called us and was fuming. He said we shouldn't have taken David out for dinner without letting him know. He also said he couldn't believe we were inappropriate in front of his son. I had to think a lot about this because I honestly couldn't find anything to be inappropriate in our household. \n\nMichael explained it was me kissing my wife when she came home, hugging her 'every damn second' and showing affection towards David. He was also quite repulsed by the idea of all of us snuggling to watch a disney movie. He was mad because he said David was going to be a man and his stay at our house has confused him.\n\nI honestly was at a loss for words. I told him I wouldn't apologise for these things but I said I think he is getting a lot of things wrong. He told me I would always act decent in Christmas with our families and he thought we'd show his son the same respect. It is true, but at the same time it is a completely different scenario.\n\nAita here?

The comment about David \"going to be a man\" is frightening me.\n\nEdit to add: obviously NTA. Your brother is, though, saying that kissing your wife and snuggling together would \"confuse\" his \"future man\"", "Nta your bother sounds crazy. Nothing u did sounds inappropriate or not normal to do in front of kids. I Mean maybe u should have asked about his diet and food he can have but just wow to everything else.", "NTA. Your brother needs to be in therapy.\n\n>David was going to be a man\n\nYeah this is a toxic mentality. Sad that kid is being raised by an apparent bigot.", "NTA. I missed the genders at first, but when you described his objections I went back to check. Sorry to say your brother is homophobic, and he didn\u2019t want his son to see \u201cthat kind\u201d of affection.", "Honestly I'm a little confused. Is it that Michael thinks the things you did together aren't \"manly enough?\" Regardless it sounds like you were very kind and David has a wonderful time with his cousins. If there any real boundaries broken Michael sure didn't make them clear. And if his boundaries are \"no affection\" then that's just sad. NTA. You sound awesome.  \n\n\nEdit: oh, re-reading, I realised you are two women. Yeah I think Michael doesn't want him to see gay people. Well that's his problem if he wants to drop his son off with you. What a dick.", "LOL so your brothers upset that you showed your nephew what a loving home is?", "NTA. Has your brother always been this homophobic?", "your brother sounds insane.\n\nyou are NTA. i feel really sorry for that poor kid.", "NTA and you were great with your nephew.\n\nWTH?  Basic PDA does not confuse an 8yo boy.  Sounds as if your family displayed normal affection for each other.  Your brother has some weird ideas and is possibly homophobic.\n\nAnd if that is all it takes to confuse a kids, well, then, we will have a world of very confused kids.  I'd actually venture to say that normal affection actually HELPS kids develop and adjust to the world.", "NTA, poor David too, to grow in such a frosty home that even _snuggling an 8 yo kid_ is deemed inappropriate. \nYou did nothing wrong, just showed the poor kid what an emotionally healthy home life looks like.", "Nta\n\nYour brother is being weird about the dinner and has strange attitudes towards what his child should be. He is 8. Him needing to \"be a man\" is just a ridiculous thing to say.\n\nIf his son being shown basic affection towards him and from you to you wife confuses him then that's a deficit in what your brother teaches him and is something your brother needs to address.", "NTA.  Your brother was kinda homophobic, I don\u2019t know him to assure that he is, but the fact that you hugged and kiss you wife shouldn\u2019t make him mad.  If his son had questions about it, it\u2019s normal, his only eight, and it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to explain that whenever two people love each other, they show affection, no matter what gender or anything.  Maybe he\u2019s too caught up at his work, and didn\u2019t want to deal with it, but being angry at you after taking care of his son, and actually providing him a great day with his aunts and cousins, he should be very greatful.", "NTA\n\nHow were you to know your brother\u2019s plan was to raise his son immersed in toxic masculinity & homophobia?", "NTA - Your brother's view is whacked. Was your childhood devoid of PDA, blanket snuggling, hugs...? His sense of 'acting decent' was shaped by something. \n\nHis statements were shocking to say the least.", "NTA. Your brother sounds like he bought into toxic masculinity, not showing emotions, being macho etc as a boy. \nYou are a great father and you did absolutely no wrong. It just sounds like your brother doesn't want someone being a better father figure to his son.", "Nta wtf is wrong with your brother.", "Nta your brother sounds disturbed", "NTA and hell no. Maybe he could learn to parent.", "NTA the second he said it was kissing your wife, I went back up to the top to see you're female too.  He's obviously just being homophobic and worried that your nephew is going to catch being gay or worse, become tolerant.", "NTA\n\nYour brothers got issues.  There's nothing wrong with kissing your wife hello.  There's nothing wrong with snuggling up on the couch with your family.  There's a whole lot wrong with this:\n\n>he said David was going to be a man and his stay at our house has confused him.", "What? ?? Fellow lesbian. So sorry your brother is  a jerk. My family isn\u2019t the best either. NTA.", "NTA, I would think it would be assumed you would be feeding the child if he was with you the whole time. Whether that is going out or cooking at home I dont think would matter. And kisses and hugs are normal types of affection between husband and wife. And generally hugs and snuggling up on the couch to watch a movie isnt abnormal with kids that age.\n\nIt sounds like a combination of homophobia and your brother not having a very affectionate/loving relationship with his son, maybe a combination of the two, like his homophobia is keeping him from showing normal physical affection to his son. \n\nNot sure how you can fix that, with fathers like that the mother is usually the one giving the affection, i dont know the circumstances of how he became a single father but maybe some of it has to do with that as well? I feel bad for the kid.", "That harmful narrative about being a man is part of why so many men have issues.", "Wow. Just wow. Your brother is an asshole. So you kissed your wife and have a loving and affectionate relationship? Unless you two were sticking your tongue down one another's throats and groping one another in front of his kid, you did nothing wrong. He knew you were gay when he dropped his son off to you, right?", "NTA. Did your parents not hug you as children? If they did, is your brother still \"a man?\" \nYour brother is not normal, and this behavior is going to significantly damage his son.", "NTA. what a sensitive prick your brother is", "NTA. Why would your brother apparently be okay with his son staying with you for the day if he\u2019s homophonic? That doesn\u2019t make sense. I also don\u2019t know how confused your nephew would be unless he\u2019s being told that same sex couples are \u201cinappropriate\u201d. It\u2019s definitely concerning that your brother seems to have some strict opinions on what gender means.", "NTA. Tell him you are sorry his moral are all skewed into the hate culture out there. But what you did was not wrong no matter where you do it or who is there when you do. \n\nAnd when someone goes off like he did, I look at them with a knowing smile and say \"methinks thou dost protest to much\" (alluding to his own desires conflicting with his bs morals, hehehehe).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That you and your wife showing affection for one another as well as the whole family made a big enough impression on your nephew that he talked about it with his dad is\u2026telling. But doubtfully in the way he thinks. \n\nI\u2019m assuming David knows what gay people are since you are his aunt, but since he brought up snuggling during a movie as well, it sounds like he\u2019s more baffled by the idea of *affection in general* than queer people. \n\nAs sad as the possibility of that is, I want to encourage you that no matter what happens from here, you might have just made a much bigger impact on his life than you realize. I grew up with parents who didn\u2019t fight or anything, but never showed any affection for one another beyond a pat on the back, and the concept of platonic/familial snuggling with anyone for a movie was equally outside of my world. Seeing other families behave more normally with one another once I was a few years older than David is now was important. I wish I had seen it, or understood it better, earlier. But if he\u2019s talking about that now, you made an impact, and it may very well pave the way to helping him break the cycle of whatever weird toxic behavior his father seems to be modeling for him when he\u2019s older.", "You are not the asshole, but your brother definitely is. He thinks showing affection is weird? Sounds like he doesn\u2019t give his son positive affection at all. He\u2019s a bad dad. His views of toxic masculinity will severely impact his son\u2019s social abilities later in life. I\u2019m glad he got to experience healthy familial love with you and your family.
