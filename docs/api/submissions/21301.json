I was alarmed by the costs of a foreign wedding, but Dani brushed me off saying that her parents would cover it. My BIL (Dani's brother) tells me he is surprised I asked for my in laws to cover the wedding afterwards. I was confused by this, but he told me Dani's parents told their kids they would either buy them a house or pay for their wedding.\n\nI asked Dani about this, and she got really defensive as she said she had always wanted a big wedding from when she was little and thought that was way better than a house, which we could buy anyway, as she was convinced we could afford it. I have a high paying job as a doctor, but I am diabetic (healthcare is not free) and have student debt. Dani earns less than me, but she got her job straight after graduation through family connections. I am not sure how she thinks we can afford a house right now, and we will probably have to rent for the next 3-4 years.

All I will say is that one benefit of not practicing arranged marriage and instead, having an extended period of dating and engagement before the wedding, is you get to work out if you and your partner share the same priorities before you\u2019re that deeply committed.  If your priorities match up, great, if they don\u2019t you can either work out a compromise or end the relationship.  You did not have that advantage, so the first time you found yourselves with conflicting priorities, someone had to not get their way and as it was her money, you were the one who missed out.\n\nThere\u2019s no real bad guy, you just faced one of the drawbacks of a system which, like all others, has its pros and cons.

HER parents gave HER a choice as to what SHE wanted them to pay for with THEIR money. It was a gift to her, their child, not you.", "Sounds to me like you two have some very different ideas about finances and how a household should be run. I would say that this is something that you two should iron out prior to actually getting married.\n\nOne of the down sides of an arranged marriage is that you often don't find out these kinds of things until it's too late.  The assumption is made that because you both have the same cultural background and because your parents are agreeable to one another that these kinds of things would be just worked out.\n\nBut in a modern world there are SO MANY differences between  how children are raised, even if everyone is from the same place and of the same social cast. \n\nIn my opinion, making that choice shows that you two have some significant differences in values.  Those differences in values are concerning to me.\n\nThis choice of house or wedding, it's basally another way of asking \"save for the future, or spend it now\".  She chose to spend it now, and you would have chosen to save for the future.  In addition, she did not think it worth consulting you on this choice.  She put her own want so far above what you might have wanted that she didn't even bother to ask you.\n\nI don't come from a culture of arranged marriage, so I'm not super comfortable telling you what to do one way or another since I have a hard time placing myself into that kind of situation. My opinion is basally \"this is the exact reason why arranged marriages are a bad idea\".\n\nI don't think you are an asshole.  Might be worthwhile having a conversation with her and her parents about this situation and why she didn't feel the need to consult with you.  But I don't know if bringing her parents into it would violate some kind of social boundary or not.", "You only live once. As a man, I don\u2019t feel you have any say in the matter since it\u2019s not your money. You can think it\u2019s financially irresponsible and what not but to me, that makes you glass half full.\n\nShe wants to always remember her wedding as a special day to a man she\u2019s decided to spend the rest of her life with, nothing more romantic than that.\n\nEspecially given that you\u2019re both well off. You\u2019re not struggling financially, maybe try to live in the moment a bit.", "It's probably NAH.  You both agreed to marry and spend the rest of your lives together, but you didn't bother to learn what each of you thinks makes you happy.\n\nShe thought dream wedding, and that's done now.  You didn't bother to think about it before, and now you have a nice memory.  Enjoy and cherish the memories, they are in the past and nonrefundable.\n\nFrom this moment on, talk with your partner and keep digging deeper until you find common ground before making big future effecting decisions.\n\nBecome partners and look forward.", "NAH, but she\u2019s 22 so, not surprising.", "NTA\n\nI get that your wife wanted a big wedding, since she would be able to fully control that to get hearts content.\n\nBUT!\n\nShe's married to you, you may start a family, you may need family in the future to move in emergencies, and she chose to spend all that money on.... The wedding. Once again, this was arranged, so that feeling of control might have been needed for your wife.\nBut it shows she only thought of herself, not you two as a couple down the line.

I would back down and be grateful to your in-laws for paying for anything.", "NAH. But read your own words: \"let their children decide\".

Basically it's just that their parents agreed with other parents that they wanted their kids to meet and potentially would like each other to marry, and become a family. It's not like what you're thinking at all. Their parents arrange blind dates for them with the kids of other families/parents they like. In the end, both of the people dating decide if they want to continue to see each other and take it further or ask their parents for a new match. Given they actually get matches and dates, it's not much more than an upgraded tinder that you don't have to waste money on, for a girl to say yes and go on some dates with you.\n\nThis is a tough one because tbh, it's not OPs money at all, and he wasn't expecting any of it to begin with. So really he has no say in it.\n\nHowever realistically if you've agreed to get married, hiding huge sums of money that could change your lives entirely across the next decade or so isn't really something you should feel you have to hide from your fiance. She should have told you, but it was her parents money and her choice, so really you'd just have to decide if you'd choose not to marry her if she'd told you beforehand that's how she was using the money. Rather than towards a better future for both of you, as presumably by the sounds of it, you're going to be providing the majority of the funds for the rest of your future now and she likely expects you to, and to earn enough to buy the house.\n\nSo it's knowing she'd make the same decision regardless of if she told you or not, and if that would change how you saw her or if you agreed to marry/keep seeing her. And then how do you feel about her choice to hide it, rather than discussing it? But whilst still being aware you would have no say in it anyway.\n\nPresumably in the type of culture you're from, you're also likely to have children and help them out. If you had a lot of money and could offer them a house or wedding, and the girl desperately wanted a big wedding... would you choose not to let her have that? Again culturally, if you're like my friends who have had arranged marriages... The girls literally can't seem to wait for them and want matches and a husband and brought it up tons. To a lot of my friends, that event was more important to them also than a house. But partially they were brought up to think like that... you likely were taught the opposite. \n\nSo there's a lot of factors here, but the main thing I'd be pissed at is that she felt like she needed to hide it.", "Big, ignorant assumption", "That\u2019s not how that works\u2026", "Wtf?

I\u2019ve met enough Indians that tell me this. Considering she\u2019s not listening to her future husband\u2019s opinions it doesn\u2019t sound like a very strict culture anyway.", "True. Only reason I had one was because that's how it is in my culture (wedding is more for the parents to 'brag' about how well they raised their son/daughter and how they caught the perfect spouse that will give them lots of grandkids and live happily ever after yada yada yada), it made my relatives happy because relatives from 4 states gathered together, it was paid for my parents (relatives chipped in time and energy) and my sister needed pictures of the 'cultural' wedding to convice authorities she didn't marry my BIL for a green card (she took part in the reception which I was OK with).", ">Please use a little bit of your brain and even if it was forced the man would have been forced as well. White saviour complex, \u201coh no got to save the poor women from these oppressive cultures\u201d.\n\nI'm actually of South East Asian descent and my aunt (well my mom's cousin but they grew up together as sisters) was in an arranged marriage lol. Both my grandparents were in an arranged marriage but one was because of the Japanese invasion in WW2 and the other was because it was both their second marriage because there was no child from their respective first marriages. \n\nI was given the chance to find a love match before I reached 30yo or else my relatives would start 'searching' for my husband. And I was told there were quite a few families and men that were inquiring about me after I got my job because of my families social status, my job+benefits, how I'd be an 'asset' for their career etc. If I wasn't already halfway engaged (I was planning the engagement ceremony), I think those people would have been very determined.", "Equity is not everybody's sole goal. I would be able to buy a house sooner if I didn't go on holidays or have hobbies but I value experiences and memories. OPs wife valued the fancy wedding.", "Although it is a less financial prudent decision, we should not pass judgement. She is from upper middle class / rich family, no student debt and with a stable job with family connections. For her, experience and sentiments are probably more valuable than materialistic things like a house. If I get the chance to experience once-in-a-lifetime Northern Lights, for example, but delay buying a house for 4 years, I would too.", "If he bought it before the marriage with money from his own parents? Nah. The woman would be getting blasted for wanting money she had no right to *and* probably accused of wanting it for a big lavish wedding.", "Also seems like there's a lack of financial compatibility.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yeah the whole \u201crelationships should involve open communication\u201d goes away when people want to infantilize a women because \u201cshe was forced.\u201d Alright well it sounds like OP is being forced to marry a short sighted women with no concept of budgeting.", "Depending on the culture, \"arranged\" could mean arranged for some and forced for others.", "He expects her to pop out his babies for him without even really knowing him, but y\u2019all are upset he doesn\u2019t get the house too lol wild.", "People just want to blame the man for everything", "It might. My husband\u2019s first wife really just wanted a party.", "An elephant is no doubt awesome. Im sure as a guest it\u2019s a great time.", "It also may be the culture where OP's wife comes from. It could be that she was strongly pressured to pick the wedding because of parental expectations of what the wedding should be.", "Fair enough.", "Arranged marriages nowadays are more like assisted marriages. Your family will find a potential match for you, you have the option to meet them and after a few dates decide whether you want to marry them. They might not have dated for long enough for finances to come up in this way, but she most likely wasn't forced into it. \n\nPersonally, this wasn't for me and my parents accepted that and never pushed it. I obviously can't say how much say OP and his wife's parents had in their marriage, but the western preconceived notion of arranged marriage is out of date...for the most part.", "What is the point of assuming that? You only have the information presented in front of you, but instead you're making assumptions about their culture and making negative jumps? Arranged marriage is incredibly normal and a lot of cultures have many happy arranged situations that never come close to forced marriage.", "I don't think this is a culture where OPs wife was forced to marry him on account she has a high paying job", "Why on earth do you think he expects that? \n\nHe's clearly bothered about his wife not having a conversation with him about the wedding gift. There's nothing more to it than that", "HE gets a divorce, though.", "You sound very ignorant and arrogant. You\u2019re filling in holes to fit the narrative you want instead of actually focusing on the topic.", "AITA just wants to blame the man for everything.\n\nThis sub is remarkably sexist against men. There's even been experiments and fake posts here that verify it. It just is what it is. \n\nAITA simply isn't reliable when it comes to relationship issues, as most commenters are either biased, young, and have never been in a serious relationship.\n\nThe OPs situation is straight forward. \n\nHe and his wife were set up by family. They both agreed to it. They're both successful. He's upset that his wife made a massive financial decision without so much of a conversation.\n\nThat's it. There's nothing else to it. People need to jump through fire to justify him being TA. \n\nIf the roles were reversed, shed be in the right for feeling like this. But because is a man, who \"forced her to marry him\", he doesn't get a say lol", "Wrong!!!\n\nWomen want to blame men and men want to blame women for everything.", "This is the new normal now. Everything, everywhere is a man\u2019s fault. We should just lay everything down for a month and see how they like the way things go.", "The same here .. He should just go for the second wife right now, and safe himself  a few years of suffering.", "Paying for something like that\u2026noooooooooooo. But seeing it \u2026!", "It was literally given as a choice, a big lavish wedding or a house. Princess went with the wedding.", "Oh I know what it is, I\u2019m from the ME and where I come from arranged marriages are 90% forced on the woman and 10% what you\u2019re describing. A few dates aren\u2019t enough for any healthy relationship to progress into marriage and at the end families rarely ask the woman, she is voluntold. I find it a disgusting and oppressive tradition and no amount of dressing it up as \u201cjust a blind date\u201d will convince me that women aren\u2019t treated as property and pawned off by the family to another guy in arranged marriages. Clearly this one proceeded in similar fashion as they\u2019re super young and clueless about one another. I know that people who support these traditions will say this is an outlier but I wager it\u2019s actually one of the least bad examples when it comes to arranged marriages.", "More accurate to say \u201carranged meeting\u201d I think with \u201cmarriage encouraged\u201d but only a family of assholes would force 2 people who don\u2019t want to be with each other to proceed with the marriage.", "Wealthy kids will definitely have marriage situations forced on them, especially because of their wealth and status.", "She gets the wedding but won\u2019t get the house also like she is expecting.", "Because she didn\u2019t want the free house over a party?", "What I'm saying is that we don't know *how* it was presented. It could have been more like, \"well, we could buy you a house if you waaaaant, but you know all our friends and family will expect a big wedding, and they'll think we're poor if you don't have one.\"\n\nOr it could have been \"We'll buy you a house, and then we can come stay in it whenever we want! Yay!\"\n\nOr BIL is wrong and the house was only offered to the boys. We have all of this about thirdhand.", "Ah, sorry for assuming! I come from an Indian background but grew up in the west, so my experience is different to yours. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of arranged marriages at all, but I do know people (both women and men) who went into the process willingly and are happy, even if they learned more about each other once they had already been married. But I also know of plenty of people who have been stuck in horrible marriages. I don't know what the case was for OP, but I'm not going to assume that their match was definitely misogynistic and awful as arranged marriages can sometimes be. There are more shades of grey now.", "I\u2019m not from the culture of arranged marriages myself but I had a friend who was told that she either marries the man chosen for her or her parents will stop supporting her and paying for her education. Wasn\u2019t really much of a \u201cchoice\u201d for her unless she was willing to be disowned from her family", "The old Middle East bad, west good. No one\u2019s believing you. I seen plenty of Middle Eastern women both irl and online telling people they\u2019re not oppressed. 90% forced is just a statistic you made up lmfao, at least try to make your statistics believable.", "That isn't what I mean", "BEcause she did not involve him in the decission at all.\n\nSHe proably expects HIM to pay for her (he makes much more), but she was NOT willing to spend HER money in a way he found beneficial, too.", "Dude imagine telling someone who was born and lived years in the ME that they don\u2019t know the ME. The fact that you think there can be reliable statistics on the issue in the ME, that women can be asked and tell their opinions honestly proves how clueless you are. Just a few weeks a go there was news of how a 6 year old was arranged married to a full grown adult where I\u2019m from, a woman was killed by the government for showing hair in Iran not that long ago, I\u2019m not interested in your opinion on the matter.", "Doesn't indicate financial or any reliable independence, which I believe is what you meant. Not a big deal."]}
