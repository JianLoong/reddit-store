At least she gets the party she wants out of the deal. Nah", "NAH.\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong for being frustrated and wanting different things, your wife is not wrong for wanting to spend her family\u2019s money the way she wants and her family are not wrong for supporting her in their own way.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to get in to weighing the benefits of one culture against another, and I am aware of many benefits to a (properly safeguarded) arranged marriage, so I\u2019m going to tread carefully here.  All I will say is that one benefit of not practicing arranged marriage and instead, having an extended period of dating and engagement before the wedding, is you get to work out if you and your partner share the same priorities before you\u2019re that deeply committed.  If your priorities match up, great, if they don\u2019t you can either work out a compromise or end the relationship.  You did not have that advantage, so the first time you found yourselves with conflicting priorities, someone had to not get their way and as it was her money, you were the one who missed out.\n\nThere\u2019s no real bad guy, you just faced one of the drawbacks of a system which, like all others, has its pros and cons.  I hope you\u2019re able to work past this and have a happy life together.", "Well, NTA for being cross with her, but...\n\n...you have to let go, as I assume the wedding already happened and have all been paid. She knows your standpoint and you keep bringing it up will only damage the marriage in the long run. Maybe try to find out if there are any other family agreements she didn't share with you yet.", ">we will probably have to rent for the next 3-4 years\n\nSo you'll still be in your twenties when you're able to buy a house. Hopefully you'll both be better communicators by then.", "I can't decide on who's the A, but this lack of communication does not bode well for the future. Big decisions should be made together and you should have a serious sit-down about how you will handle things like this in the future.", "I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re an AH or not but they\u2019re definitely naive and entitled. A house over a wedding? What kind of spoiled crazy person choose a wedding if given the option. \n\nGood luck, OP. You\u2019ve got a princess on your hands.", "NTA. I would have been highly upset, too, especially since she didn't even discuss it with you before making that decision for the both of you. It's NOT a good way to start a marriage.", "NTA. I will say I believe the choice should have been hers, but I do think it should have been brought up beforehand. You did deserve to get to voice your opinion,", "NTA\n\nYour wife should have explained this situation to you and you could have voiced your opinion. Make her imagine the other way around if it were your parents and you didn't tell her about this situation. For me personally it's a red flag. Maybe think twice now before the wedding because this will certainly affect more decisions in future.", "Nta I'd rather have the wedding as a gift and the house as something I got under my own steam. It's just different preferences! TALK TO A FINANCIAL ADVISOR", "NTA. Id be reeling from the exposure of such a piss poor decision too.", "You're never the asshole for how you feel, only for what you do.\n\nIt's a little complicated in the sense that it's not your money, but your in laws'. However, when most people get married, they share expenses... I'm assuming that's the case here.\n\nSo to me, this was the first major financial decision you made as an (almost) married couple. I think your wife is the asshole here for not having explained the situation to you, and at least given you a chance to convince her before the money was spent.", "NTA- that is a huge financial decision that should have been made as a couple. I'm the one with the rich parents in my marriage and the same offer was put to us. We split the monies down by thirds in the end. Medium/large wedding and a lump sum saved for a house. This came after a discussion with my fiancee and compromises throughout. I'm sad you never managed to get that for yourself", ">Technically, it was her parents money, so she should decide where it goes.\n\nYANTA \n\nThis, her parents gave her the choice.  Even still it's perfectly normal to get upset over wasteful spending in this current economy.", "Arranged marriage to a 22 year old\u2026 and now you\u2019re finding out her values. You are a doctor and she likely said whatever you wanted to hear before the wedding. Now you find out she just wants status and thinks you have lots of money to support her. That\u2019s a warning sign if you were dating someone but now you\u2019re married to her and still young.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
