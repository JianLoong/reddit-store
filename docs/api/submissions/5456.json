Her parents were always very approving of us dating, which we started doing in high school. Her parents split up a year after my wife finished high school, and her dad moved out of the picture, so it was just her mom (now 65F) primarily. Her mother was the nicest person in the world until our first child was born four years ago. Her issue with it was that our son was born out of wedlock. She was very vocal about her disapproval of this, but my wife seemed to be able to get her to come around. However, she since has been cold, passive-agressive, and in some cases downright mean to us, and, much worse, our son. I wouldn\u2019t even say the family is religious, but it seems to just be a custom that is abided by in that family. My brother- and sister-in-law both have partners, but are waiting until marriage to have kids, much to my MIL\u2019s delight. The last four years, she has blown off numerous events, only hanging out with us if her other kids are busy. She didn\u2019t even come to our wedding, which of course caused a massive rift in the family. \n\nAll of this time, I\u2019ve been nothing but lenient with her. I\u2019ve never lost my temper or gotten mad at her, never been vocal or had any resistance to her whatsoever. I\u2019ve given her hundreds of chances to redeem herself. \n\nLast New Year\u2019s eve, we convinced her to babysit our son; we made these concrete arrangements in September and checked in on it multiple times between September and December. As my wife and I were preparing to go out (getting dressed up, etc.), she cancelled on us, saying she had \u201cother plans\u201d. My wife and I weren\u2019t able to hire a babysitter and so had to stay back with our son (which obviously wasn\u2019t the worst thing in the world). \n\nIn June 2022, we told her we were expecting our second child, and I think you can imagine her reaction (\u201coh this time you actually waited until you were married\u201d, etc.) - she gave us hell, mostly through snarky remarks, but while a bit tipsy a couple of days later she went so far to call us \u201csex-addicts\u201d because none of her other kids had had kids yet. \n\nFor all of this year, I\u2019ve acted like nothing happened, blowing the New Year\u2019s eve and June debacles off, but this Christmas, I\u2019ve decided to take my revenge and I told her she won\u2019t be invited to our family christmas (which is saying something, because even my wife\u2019s dad, who we rarely make contact with, is coming). Christmas is a big deal in our family. I should also say that we have never been invited to anything hosted by her (although all of her other kids and their partners are) since our son was born, and in the rare case that she does invite our family, it\u2019s always just my wife - specifically excluding me, often explicitly.\n\nNow, with me not inviting her, my MIL is furious, my wife is furious, most of the family is furious, and now I need to know - AITA?", "created_utc": 1671800231, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztem6e/aita_for_not_inviting_my_mil_to_christmas/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it's time you both confront her mother over her treatment of you both and have a united front over no more invites and limited communication until she treats you both and your child(ren) like human beings and valued members of the family.

Why would you include someone who treats you and your family as anything less than full members of her family?   Your son is old enough to realize that his grandmother doesn't treat him equally, she already discriminates between him and his cousins.   And it will get worse when your new baby arrives.    There are few things more soul-crushing to children than being forced to stand by as a witness to favoritism practiced by a \"loving\" relative.    You are 100% right to step up and change direction now.\n\n>I\u2019ve decided to take my revenge and I told her she won\u2019t be invited to our family christmas\n\nI urge you to reconsider the way you are framing this because it's not about trying to inflict hurt.   Excluding her from festivities at your house should be just the first step in eliminating more hurt and to reset your relationship with your MIL.  Consider it a \"clearing of the field\" to start over.  \n\nDo not waste time in wishful efforts to get your MIL to change or thinking that exclusion will somehow make her a better person.  She's had 4 years and will never acknowledge the damage she's done.   It's up to you and your wife to change the role she has in your family life.    If your wife cannot accept that her mother is now a toxic element in your lives, I suggest therapy for your wife.   Susan forward has some excellent books that can help you understand how to turn things around  --*Toxic Parents* and *Emotional Blackmail*.   *The Verbally Abusive Relationship* by Patrica Evans may also apply. \n\nThe bottom line is that your MIL should not be given a pass to ride roughshod over your family.   She has let you know where you stand and it's past time for you to drop the rope.", "ESH.  It\u2019s not just your decision to make.

Why should they include her in their *family* events at all?", "Exactly. He is well within his rights to not invite an abusive family member.

She doesn\u2019t have to agree \u2014 invites into your home are a 2 yes, 1 no situation. That said, she should agree.

He's decided that he's not going to let his wife prioritize her mother's feelings and let her continue to denigrate his family, including a 4 year old who is definitely old enough to realize that he's not a well-loved grandchild.

And if his action gets them there, it's a good thing for that reason alone.", "So he lays out the ways in which his MIL has disrespected them for 4 years, his wife agrees that her mom is \"a bit of an AH\" but you don't think there's been discussion?   My impression is that his wife has dismissed his prior concerns and he's fed up.    I don't think it's a \"line in the sand\" moment with respect to the marriage,  I think it's more about \"we're going to fix this external issue now\".", "As far as I can tell, his wife is not doing *anything* to manage her mother if she has been accepting the occasional invitations that exclude her husband.

Wife definitely needs some therapy to understand how damaging this whole situation is to her children as well as her marriage.", "How can she when there wasn't a vote?", ">And if his action gets them there, it's a good thing for that reason alone.\n\nGee too bad they couldn't have done exactly that at any point in the last 4:years without surprising his spouse publicly", "I do not believe he has laid down an ultimatum \"mom or me\"\n\nIf he wanted to do that, then he should have done that\n\nSomething like disinviting a parent needs to be agreed upon beforehand in private, not surprising his wife with his decision publicly", "Actually, she has had a vote all along.   Why else would she assume that MIL would be invited?   Because she's her mom?"]}
