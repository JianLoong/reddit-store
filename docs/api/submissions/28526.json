It sounds like you've already been cut off.", "NTA\n\nYou're not required to maintain close ties simply because they're family.  \n\nOf course, if your partner wants to see his/her sister, you may not have much choice in seeing this kid occasionally.", "You really can't cut your SIL and niece out of your life without cutting out your brother.

Maybe have a chat with him about your concerns, but don't be surprise if he defends them or gets a bit upset.\n\nDefinitely talk to him about not coming around to see the family.

You sound like a jealous peer rather than a presumably adult uncle", ">can\u2019t even walk by a window with out staring at herself.\n\nThis could just as easily be a sign of insecurity in how your niece feels about her appearance rather than vanity, especially since it sounds like SIL has some very high expectations so she may be anxious about looking \"right\" in her mother's eyes. The teenage years are frequently a time of masking insecurity with bravado. \n\nDon't ignore her birthday, please. Maybe send a card and a cinema voucher to cover her and a friend for a fun outing together? Keep it low-key for sure, but don't cut off a kid completely, especially since it's going to almost certainly mean cutting off your brother as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

YTA for the vitriol.\n\n\nIt's a neat trick how your brother who you love and respect somehow has nothing to do with how his daughter turned out. \n\nAlso....what the hell is wrong in spending money and time supporting your kid doing something she presumably enjoys even if she's bad at it? Are you sure *you're* not 13?", "It's her brother's family, not her partner's sister's family.\n\nCan't see how she cuts out SIL and niece without cutting her brother out too. Apart from them having very different lifestyles she doesn't mention specific issues with her brother.\n\nIt sounds like there's already been a drift to low-contact from OP's brother's side, perhaps unintended on the brother's part if he's relying on SIL to keep their social diary for his friends/family as well as hers. \n\nOP's brother may have never explicitly made that expectation clear to the SIL (or actively shared his contacts list, significant dates calendar etc). Some husbands assume their wives are telepathic on this (personal experience).\n\nThe niece may be bratty/snotty right now, but she's only 13 and has time for improvement. \n\nAt least send her a birthday card with enough cash to see a movie with a friend, and write in the card \"not sure what to get you, but hope you can have a fun time with some popcorn\" or whatever. It's a gesture of broad goodwill that doesn't burn bridges, and then you've done your bit.\n\nEdit: clarity re brother and SIL respectively rather than just he/her", "Aunt not uncle per the judgement bot post, but agree it's very harsh. The kid may be counting the days until she goes to college away from her mum's expectations for all OP knows. Only time will tell but give it a chance.", "No.  I\u2019m not a fan of people who are stuck up, put others down for not having the brand named expensive stuff\u2026.   Mean girls!
