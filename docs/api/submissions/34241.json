He could either jaywalk on the road or quickly go to the crossroad and get across the street.\n\nHe widened his eyes seeing me parking the car and said I've dropped him quite far.

I didn't confront him, but at the next occasion to come back together, I was also dropping off another friend (who lived down the block so he definitely had to walk) but when he prepared to come with us I politely explained there was no reason to, because I would drop him too far away anyways. He thought I was joking this time, but I reiterated what he said and emphasized on the fact that I can't stop at the crossroad. I sort of left him there and me and my friend stepped in the car and drove away.\n\nI maybe was a little rude, but I think he deserved it.

When you offer someone a ride home you drop them at their door, or as close as you can get. Instead, you drove to your home. He should have kept his mouth shut if he wanted another lift.", "NTA - You did him a favor, you were inable to drop him off at his place and 2 minutes doesn't kill anybody. He complained about it after, not to you, but to someone else. \n\nThe confronting part could've been more kind. Just leaving him there sounds a bit too much to me, but you're still entirely in your right to say 'no' to someone who wants to hitch a ride. Y\n\nour piece reads like he didn't even *ask* you if he could come along, he *expected* it and that is not OK.", "YTA - \u201chey, Im going to just park in my normal parking lot. Do you mind walking from there?\u201d \n\nAll you had to do is just simply communicate. This isnt that big of a deal and overall you were doing someone a favor, but you offered to drive someone home then brought them to not their home.", "NTA. He was unappreciative. Consider not helping him again.", "NTA. give people an inch, they take a mile. And don't bite the hand that feeds.\n\nIf you gave him another ride, he probably would expect a ride to and from school all year.", "ESH - you offered this guy a ride home, but took him to your home. This made him walk in the cold to get to his home. That\u2019s just impolite. \n\nThe dude should have accepted what he got gracefully and not complained.", "YTA. Why offer a favour for someone if you're going to half ass it? It would not have taken you much longer to drop him off compared to his walk, and instead you made him walk on a cold winter night. \n\nAnd if you're already taking someone else with you and then not letting him get in (changes absolutely nothing for you) it's just petty and immature.", "NTA. ungrateful gets what ungrateful deserves.", "You offered a ride home and you could have told him that you\u2019ll take him up to the parking lot and he needs to walk from there. For that YTA. \n\nHowever, your question if your TA for not picking up a classmate for the second time, you haven\u2019t received any thanks and informed him on what happened, NTA", "Nah, you're not the asshole. Dude sounds like he's complaining about a 2 minute walk. Maybe next time tell him to loosen up his tight ass and enjoy the exercise.", "Nta", ">Why offer a favour for someone if you're going to half ass it?\n\nHalf assing it would be if he literally left him half way. Anyone can walk two streets AND ve grateful someone gave them a free ride.", "Offering to give someone a ride back home, and then not giving him a ride back home is definitely half assing it. \n\n\"I can drop you off a bit closer\" is different to saying \"I can drop you off home\"", "You unilaterally decided \"back home\" is exclusive at yhe doorstep and decided this was the brsaking poont of the argument. No it's not. Back home can mean a number of different perspectives. \n\nIn the end the guy had a choice a ride or no ride with added 5 minutes of walking. I understand for Americans walking is hard but please try not act so entitled."]}
