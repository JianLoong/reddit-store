She tolerates (her words) my son.  She has never watched him, i've also never asked.  My son is present at all family functions, this annoys my sister.  \n\nMy sister has turned into your classic dog mom.  World revolves around the dog type.   I do not own dogs, and really don't want to be around them. I don't want them in my house.  Well my sister wanted to bring her dog to Christmas, and I said no.  Its well trained and overall okay for a dog, I just didn't want it at my house, or even my yard.  She complied and left it alone but was not happy about and let me know that several times.  \n\nThe day before New Years Eve, she told me kids weren't welcome at her house.  I was taken back by this and asked why.  She just said alcohol would be present (we all drink and family friends also come to this party), and just said it wouldn't be appropriate for a 2 year old to be present.  My wife and I had planned to only stay till 10 anyway and then would go home because of our kid.  We reconsidered and opted to not go at all and respected my sisters wishes by keeping the kid at home.  I let her know a half hour before the party started.  \n\nWife and I treated it like any other night, we didn't even stay up till midnight.  By Eleven, I noticed missed calls from her, and didn't answer. Fell asleep while texts started coming in.  Calling me an asshole.  Calling me a dog hater.  Saying it was rude I didn't come to the party.  Said it was bullshit that she got my kid a Christmas present but didn't get her dog anything.  The list went on, she was clearly drunk. I tried to call her, she didn't answer and got a text, \"I'm not answering asshole\".

I rolled my eyes at that one.

You can\u2019t leave a two-year-old home alone. Comparing a child and a pet is comparing apples and oranges.", "NTA fact that your sister\u2019s text mentioned the dog and Christmas means that her no-kid rule for New Year\u2019s was directly related to your no-dog rule at Christmas.", "Definitely NTA. Your sister is the asshole. She was clearly upset that you didn\u2019t allow her child (dog) to your house, so she didn\u2019t allow your child to hers. \n\nEven if you wanted to go, how the Hell were you supposed to get a babysitter the day before NYE? She knew exactly what she was doing.\n\nEDIT: BTW, on the subject of a gift for her dog, we have two kids and two dogs. My wife and I get small Christmas gifts for our dogs, but no one else does (grandparents, aunts, and uncles, etc). We don\u2019t expect them to get anything for our fur babies either.", "NTA. she gave you the option to go and you decided not to. Sounds like she was trying to get back at you for not allowing her dog at your house.\n\nI'm \"child free\" with my partner and while we kind of give each other looks at the grocery store when there's a screaming kid, we would never go out of our way to antagonize our family with children. We get to be the fun party aunts who give awesome presents without the responsibility of actually raising a child. We also call our cats our \"kids\" but we also know that it's not in any way a replacement or anywhere CLOSE to an actual child. \n\nYour sister has a lot of issues that I don't think you're equipped to handle. *puts on my armchair psychology glasses* something tells me she might be jealous of the fact that you get the attention of parents having a young child, and she tried to get that same kind of attention by getting a dog, and is now super pissed that people don't treat her dog like a human child.", "NTA - People saying you should\u2019ve given more notice don\u2019t seem to be noticing that she gave you only one day\u2019s notice that your kid wasn\u2019t welcome there. Even if you wanted to go, it seems unlikely you would\u2019ve been able to find a sitter in that time. And given that she clearly made this decision out of petty spite, I don\u2019t think you owed her any more notice than you gave. \n\nDogs and children are not the same. You can leave a dog at home safely. Do that with a kid and you go to jail for child endangerment.", "NTA-Sounds like she wanted to play tit for tat and got mad that you didn\u2019t give her the reaction she wanted.", "NTA-The main issue in my opinion is she waited until the day before a major holiday to say something about your kid not being allowed there.\n\nThere's no way your sister could realistically expect you to find a babysitter on such short notice. Sure, you were petty by only telling her you weren't going right before the party, but she started that game.", "NTA. A dog isn\u2019t a human, why would you give it a present? I think she does have a point about bringing a toddler to a boozy NYE party, but you\u2019re not an asshole for deciding to stay home and giving her a heads up half an hour beforehand", "NTA. She went on a drunken tirade and is using her dog as an equivalent to your child. Which it\u2019s not. I get it, as a dog owner, but it\u2019s not. She made her bed, now she has to lie in it.", "NTA. I am child-free and a dog owner. While I consider my dog my \u2018baby\u2019, I also realize that it\u2019s not the same as a parent/child relationship, and I would NEVER presume that my dog should be treated equal to the children in my family.

I was gonna say ESH because you declined an hour before which is poor etiquette but it was only because you were given notice a day before the party which is not acceptable by any standard, and I say this as a childfree person myself. \n\nMy family are aware we don't allow children at our home due to expensive equipment, swords, art stuff and we refuse to put younger family members in hospital for the crime of being curious when they're still too young to know better. For this reason we don't host parties, but we DO bring food, help prep and clean up at other person's and host our own celebrations at restaurants. For anything a child is not welcome at we give as much notice as possible, with a reassurance we wouldn't ever be offended if they can't come due to having the child. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. Your sister however, needs to grow up a bit.", "NTA (Source, mom of 2 humans and one dog).", "NTA.  Children and dogs are not the same.  With a dog, you can lock it up in a cage and go out dancing and drinking with your friends until the small hours of the morning. If you do this to a toddler, you will go to prison. \n\nEven adult dogs sometimes shit and piss in new environments. Dogs don\u2019t wear diapers the way the two year old probably does.  Dogs can be very unpredictable around children. \n\nNOBODY should expect they can bring their damned dog to someone else\u2019s house without a special dispensation.  It\u2019s also true that you shouldn\u2019t bring children to an environment where they are not wanted so I think OP did the right thing.  The sister sounds like a serious piece of work.", "NTA. She\u2019s outta line", "NTA.\n\nYou do understand that your sister was trying to punish you because you didn't let her bring her dog to christmas.\n\nThis was supposed to be retaliation.\n\nYou \"opted out\" of your punishment by simply not going (an option that probably never occured to her).\n\nShe also equates her dog with your child and wants equal treatment for both.\n\nIt probably doesn't help that people asked her where you were and why you didn't come and she prob got shit for it.", "NTA.\n\nThe whole dog thing is hillarious, though.

I do hope you didn\u2019t plan on drinking though, or one of y\u2019all (you or your wife) was planning to DD. Drinking while driving kids around rubs me the wrong way, even if you planned on just a couple drinks. Don\u2019t do that.", "NTA  Your son is a member of the family.....a legit member of the family.  So, she needs to do more than \"tolerate\" him.  She needs to respect that he is your child.  If she decided to make her party child free, you had every reason to decline attending because you aren't child free and it might have been difficult to get a sitter.  Or maybe you didn't feel like going out, which is okay, too.\n\nWhile you don't care for dogs, there are many who consider dogs a member of their family.  I know we feel that way.  I suspect your sister might be feeling upset that you discount the attachment and love they feel for their dog, and how they view him as their \"baby\".  But, that doesn't mean a person should bring their dog over to attend family gatherings unless it's okay with the host.  Many dogs behave differently when they are away from home.", "NTA\u2026you both are entitled to decide who comes to your home\u2026\n\nEveryone saying ESH and you should have given her warning doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nShe waited till the day before. She was doing it out of SPITE (cuz let\u2019s be real, her excuse was terrible as I\u2019m sure there is alcohol at thanksgiving and Christmas). \n\nUnless it was some catered event where she had to pay $100 a plate for each guest who cares? Was there some secret thing we don\u2019t know about that cost OPs sister money? It wasn\u2019t at an amusement park where she bought tickets ahead of time or anything. It was at her house.\n\n\nAnd since when is anyone obligated to answer a phone or respond to a text?", "NTA\n\nShe said no kids, she got no kids. Sucks if she expected you to get a babysitter and leave your child on NYE but that is far less socially acceptable than leaving a \"furbaby\" for an evening.\n\nAnyway, talk to each other. Apologise for cancelled last minute because that was kinda childish. But ultimately you just did what she asked and didn't bring your kid to her house.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and a nice gesture might be to ask if she's celebrating the dog's birthday at any point and getting it a gift. If you're really wanting to extend the olive branch.", "NTA\n\nDogs are not children. \n\nWe are a huge dog family and spoil our dogs like crazy people. However, we do not expect others to treat our dogs like humans.\n\nMost childfree people comprehend that not wanting children of your own doesn\u2019t give you the right to fail to understand that children are fully human. They don\u2019t need to birth children, raise children, invite them to their houses, or given them special status when interacting them - but childfree people do need to recognize they are no more human and have no more right to exist than a child does.\n\nPerhaps most relevant here: being completely honest with yourself, when you received a call on December 30 to tell you children weren\u2019t welcome, you knew you didn\u2019t have a prayer of finding a qualified babysitter still available on New Year\u2019s Eve - so it was a little bit petty not to say you weren\u2019t coming until half an hour before the party - but if your sister is being emotionally honest, she knew (or should easily have been able to comprehend) that telling you the day before New Year\u2019s that children weren\u2019t welcome was the functional equivalent of uninviting you because you would never find a sitter.", "NTA.  Pets are not equal to kids.  You might have to have some tough conversations with the rest of the family though about who hosts and who can attend if she sticks to this.", "NTA.

You chose to stay home with your family.", "NTA.\n\nYou're within your right to stay home during a child free event - its fine for events to be child free - but hosts also have to expect some will skip them.\n\nAlso, wtf, she expected a gift for her DOG?! How entitled.", "NTA- I think she was drunk when she texted you. I have a dog and a cat. I love both of them and spoil them rotten. However, kids and pets are not the same. I would not leave my 3 year old son at home alone like I would my dog (who gets to lounge on a lovely Tempur-pedic\n bed). \n\nI feel like their is a midlife crisis thing going on with her and her \u201ctolerating\u201d your son may be out of build up regression for not having children or at least a family herself.

My friends and relatives homes with the exception of evacuating to my sisters during a Hurricane. I asked her first though and since she had 3 dogs it was no problem.\n\nI have gotten  Christmas presents for my nieces. My sister never got my dog a present and I would have been shocked if she did.

Your sister is crazy if she thinks having a kid and a dog are the same thing.", "NTA... best reaction is to ignore her ignorance.  We have no kids and my dog is sleeping between us. I get dog sitter if we are going to be away for more then 4 hours. We understand the difference between children and pets.", " NTA, an Invite is not a summons. You could have told her a bit earlier than half an hour before the party started, that was a little petty (unless you didn\u2019t decide until then, or there was another reason to wait), but other than that, you\u2019re fine.", "NTA. \n\nI have a totally honest question because it's not the first time I've seen the argument of *\"it's an event where there will be alcohol and therefore it is not appropriate for children\"*, this thought is something from Reddit? Or is it something from the US? Or is it something from most countries? I am from a Latin American country and all family parties (birthdays, baptisms, celebrations, weddings, Christmas, New Year, etc.) include alcohol. Everyone has a beer or wine and no one crosses the mind that it is inappropriate for a child to be there, honestly if someone told me that I would be paralyzed trying to understand what they are trying to tell me.", "NTA your sister is for saying a dog and a child are the same. If you remove all arguments around value of human life etc, it could just come down to: a 2 year old child cannot be left alone safely ever vs a dog can happily be left with food, water, shelter and toys. Sounds like she really doesn't like children and has some kind of personal resentment towards you for having a child.", "NTA.

Maybe she doesn't like sharing attention with the baby. Maybe she feels like you disrespect her decision to be child-free. Maybe she wants everything back to how it was before your wife and baby came along. \n\nTry working on adjusting expectations on both sides.

Its well trained and overall okay for a dog, I just didn't want it at my house, or even my yard.  She complied and left it alone but was not happy about and let me know that several times.  \n\nThe day before New Years Eve, she told me kids weren't welcome at her house.  I was taken back by this and asked why.  She just said alcohol would be present (we all drink and family friends also come to this party), and just said it wouldn't be appropriate for a 2 year old to be present.  My wife and I had planned to only stay till 10 anyway and then would go home because of our kid.  We reconsidered and opted to not go at all and respected my sisters wishes by keeping the kid at home.  I let her know a half hour before the party started.  \n\nWife and I treated it like any other night, we didn't even stay up till midnight.  By Eleven, I noticed missed calls from her, and didn't answer. Fell asleep while texts started coming in.  Calling me an asshole.  Calling me a dog hater.  Saying it was rude I didn't come to the party.  Said it was bullshit that she got my kid a Christmas present but didn't get her dog anything.  The list went on, she was clearly drunk. I tried to call her, she didn't answer and got a text, \"I'm not answering asshole\".  So AITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Funny thing is I wasn\u2019t mad at her about not bringing him but she was mad at me for not going.  My baby was still sick.

When it's too hot or cold to leave him in the car, and I can't take him inside wherever I'm going, he stays home with my husband, and usually he spends that time on my bed waiting for me. He's okay - not stressed or anxious - but he's miserable - he belongs with ME. Most places I go he can come inside; if he has to wait in the car we'll almost always detour to a park or trail so he can swim in the river, or run, or whatever ... Sometimes when there are no kids he plays on playground equipment (he's very agile). In other words, I take the time to meet his need for stimulation. And while he's waiting for me he always has something to chew - he keeps a supply of toys, sticks, bones and other random treasures in the backseat area.\n\nI'm not saying my way is right for everyone, but it works for me and for my dogs (he's the fourth one I've done this with) because I train them so that they know how to behave if they go into public areas, and I make sure they get the stimulation and exercise they need, and they love being with me as much as I love having them.\n\nAlso, to be clear, I work from home. I don't go out more than a couple times a week at most, so it's not as though he's cooped up in the car for hours every day.\n\nLike I said several comments up, it's situation dependent. I wouldn't leave a dog in a car all day while I worked fulltime ... In the past I've quite often taken my dogs to work with me, and because they're trained to behave well it's been good. And you've got to consider safety ... You can't leave a dog in the car where someone could feed it through the window, or steal it. You've got to be aware of weather and other hazards. Some dogs get stressed and will eat your car, so that's not a good lifestyle for them.

He is currently asleep next to me on a pillow on the couch (because he's a princess) after begging for some of my breakfast which he didn't eat because he's a picky eater. I love him so much, the goofball lol.\nAlso he's afraid of our nieces and nephews, they didn't do anything they're just toddlers and toddlers are loud, and he hates noise.

I love dogs--I pet them (with permission) when they're out and about near me, I coo over them when I visit friends who have dogs. But I absolutely do not want dogs in my house or car. I'm the opposite with children--not all that interested in them, don't coo at babies when I'm out in public, etc. But you can bet that if I have a gathering for family or friends that isn't a kegger, their kids are welcome because their kids are *people*.", "Also, I have a dog and love dogs, but my brother\u2019s dog isn\u2019t allowed over.
