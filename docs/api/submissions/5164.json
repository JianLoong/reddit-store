Waiving the inspection was the gamble the buyer took to get their offer accepted and it didn't pay off. It's a market, not a charity.", "NTA. Buyer should have done an inspection.", "NTA.\n\nAny loan company usually requires a property inspection to be done for the buyers, and it was their responsibility to address any potential issues.\n\nUnless it was a life threatening deal, cosmetic and renovations are generally As-Is unless otherwise specified. \n\nWaiting 4 months also means they probably didn't actually check things", "NTA. You can easily have issues with a newly built house, an older house is almost guaranteed to have *something* going on.\n\nI bet you had an inspection when you bought it, thus knew what you were getting.

Some states have disclosure laws that you have to state if you know about any major damage or repairs needed. But the burden is still on the buyer to have an inspection and know what they are purchasing", "NTA\n\nThere is zero reason to buy a house without an inspection, even in a seller's market. You can make an offer and say we won't bicker on inspection issues, which is quite common, but to completely forgo an inspection is ridiculous. And entirely on the purchaser.", "you are NTA\n\nAnyone who forgoes the inspection ITA, and not smart", "NTA\n\nSo long as it\u2019s in writing that they waive the right to an inspection, it\u2019s all on them.

If you filled that out truthfully, then everything else is on the buyer... and we will assume you were truthful.\n\nThe bubble caused a lot of people to do stupid things, and buying a home without a home inspection became one of those things... \n\nOld houses have problems. a $800 inspection would have figured that out.

It wasn't up to his standards either (he's a Master Sparky \ud83d\ude01). \n\nNope. The onus is on the buyer to do the inspection and they waived it. It's one thing if they did do one, and you purposely tried to conceal problems, but that's not the case. They've no one to blame but themselves.", "NTA. The buyers should have done an inspection! Issues with the house now really not your problem.", "NTA. How the heck are they even thinking it is ok to be reaching out to you? I\u2019d have assumed nobody can reach you anymore after the sale. That\u2019s the benefit of a real estate agent anyway, but even for private sale. You owe them absolutely nothing. The deal is done. Both of you should be able to move on with your lives without any of this coming back to haunt you.\n\nEdit: Literally every house has issues. Nothing is ever as perfect as it appeared pre-sale.

The state I am a Realtor in requires ANY defect the seller is aware of to be disclosed. It's never a good idea to waive inspection. Even if you agree to buy it as is, you should at least have an inspection done and have the ability to terminate even if you can't request any repairs. If you disclosed any issues you knew about, you are definitely NTA.", "As someone who has paid for an inspection and it\u2019s gone poorly and we didn\u2019t end up buying the house\u2026it\u2019s the buyer\u2019s responsibility.

In an older house, things like the roof might need a closer look, but 80 isn't particularly old.\nMaybe more maintenance than they anticipated, but if it hasn't fallen down yet its not going to.", "They waived inspection- my house turned 100 this year they have features. even brand new houses have features \u2026. make Sure you are legally clear", "NTA \n\nBlock them. \n\nIt\u2019s up to a buyer to do an inspection!", "NTA.

I would block her. \n\nPersonally, I find anyone who waives an inspection to be pretty foolhardy, as those issues would likely have come up had they bothered. Seller never insists on an inspection before sales that I've seen as they're purely in the buyer's benefit.\n\nI know the US housing bubble caused some desperate purchases, and she should be pissed her dad didn't bother to get an inspection on what is needed. Even if it was post purchase.", "Tell her Reddit says that\u2019s what you get when you waive the inspection.  \n\nNTA\n\nPerhaps she should complain to the LLC that managed the purchase process.", ">waived inspection\n\nDon't need to read anything more. NTA\n\nBuyer chose to skip inspection, meaning they agreed to buy the house as-is. Tell them to pound sand.", "NTA. It was up to them to get an inspection. The only way you would be in the wrong is if you knowingly did not disclose an issue during the process. Most states require a disclose where the seller affirms that systems are working to the best of their knowledge. \n\nExample of selling a known issue: our friends bought a house and about a year later they found a water leak coming from a kitchen wall. They opened the wall and found that a pipe had a small leak and someone had dry walled a 5 gallon bucket into the wall to collect the leaking water. The bucket had overflowed and leaked though the wall and floor. That is a known issue that could get you in trouble.", "Realtor here - do not respond in any way to this message or engage with them. Caveat emptor - they should have gotten an inspection. This is now their issue, period. Do not, I repeat, do not communicate with them. The sale is concluded, title changed hands, no further contact.

Anything you communicate can be used if they try to take any action against you.  They failed to do an inspection.  That is on them.

Thought it was a little odd they reached out in the first place (pre-close). Definitely didn't appreciate their recent communication.

Like I said, time to lawyer up.", "So definitely NTA. Paying 300-500 for an inspection an that large of a purchase is a no brainer, especially on a house that old. If you told them what you knew and they elected to not do an inspection to stand out or save money, that's on them.", "Just saw, OP is especially NTA", "We've been in one of the hottest markets for years and waiting of any inspection is and was incredibly rare. Waiving inspection contingencies over a certain value, sure. Or waiving contingencies all together sure. Never doing any inspection period? Not common. Most people turn around an inspection with 3-4 days. It won't make a sale go faster. Title companies and insurance companies don't move thay fast."]}
