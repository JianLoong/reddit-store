You are a friend of my parents. You are not MY family. This vacation is about MY family. I'm not excluding you, it isn't a dislike of you. There are lots of people I like and even love, who aren't coming, like my daughter, for instance. This isn't about you. It's only weird if you try to make it about you. Just stop, let it go. The larger group of friends and family can be another time.", "NTA...You don't have to travel with anyone you don't want to.  Your parents (and Mary) can accept that or not.  You will have to accept their decision.", "Messy, but I'm going with NTA.  Explain that you want to spend some time with just your parents, and if they can't accept that then you will respect their choice and not go.  \n\nWhether you still pay for the two of them to go is interesting.  Whether they accept, whether they pay for their friend, whether they ask you to pay for their friend, whether they get embarrassed for their selfishness, would be interesting to learn.", "NTA, op even if it was only your mother and a step parent you didn\u2019t know much at all i think its fine. They don\u2019t have to go if they don\u2019t want to leave Mary behind, Mary should listen to your point of view and be annoyed with your parents instead. I think its a lovely idea and if your parents want to pay for themselves to go another time as a whole family then thats okay too and you should take someone else that you care about and enjoy the holiday.", "NTA, you aren't taking your daughters. Sounds like they like the idea of the free trip but not with just you. I'd say never mind and you all travel separately on your own in this case.   Mary isn't your relative, as you've said, she's your parent's girlfriend. If you can leave your daughters at home, they can leave their gf.", "NTA tell your parents the trip of off if they can\u2019t do a parent/child trip. It was to be a gift of your appreciation of them as parents. Mary is not a parent. Take your daughter instead.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t inviting people based on whether or not you\u2019ve argued with them. You\u2019re inviting people who have had a familial role in your life. Does Mary bring your parents on every trip she goes on? I get she doesn\u2019t want to be left behind, but she\u2019s an adult and that not an unreasonable ask. \u201cFeeling left out\u201d is not a good reason for a grown up to insist on getting their way.", "NTA  you have a right to a trip with just your parents, especially since you\u2019re paying for it. As you\u2019ve pointed out, your daughter isn\u2019t even going.", "NTA as long as you accept that they can justifiably chose not to go now. People don\u2019t want to leave behind their partners for trips, just as people don\u2019t want to go on family trips with people they don\u2019t consider family.\n\nYou may have to accept that this trip you want with your parents may never happen and no one\u2019s necessarily the bad guy for that. It is what it is.", "NTA.  Time to cancel the plans altogether.  They can stay at home with Mary, or pay for the three of them to go without your involvement.", "NTA. You're not even including your own child. \nGirlfriend can Facetime and prepare for the FAMILY trip you already discussed.", "NTA. Your parents are weirdos.", "NTA\n\nRegardless of how your parents feel about her, or how long she's been in their lives, you explicitly made it clear that you wanted only you and your parents on this trip. To the point that you're not bringing *your own* children.\n\nOn top of that, the guilt trips, especially Mary calling you and accusing you of having a problem with her, is immature and petty.\n\nWhether Mary likes it or not, her having a relationship with your parents does not entitle her to be treated like a parent or included in things you only want your parents there for. Whether your parents like it or not, you do not have to accept Mary as a third parental figure or extend her the same considerations. And they are asking you to extend her the same considerations because they want her to go on what is supposed to be a Parent-Child trip, even if they do pay for her part.\n\nIf they want to share this experience so badly that they're willing to put their girlfriend above their child, then they can go on their own. You still go and take your daughter instead. Then it's still a parent-child trip, your just shifting the generations down since the generation above can't figure out that their partner is not one of your parents.", "NTA though somewhat leaning towards NAH.\n\nYou have 2 parents and you want to have a meaningful experience with them that you are willing to pay for. You have made it clear that other people who are family are welcome on other trips (including Mary), but that is not what you want for this trip that you are planning and offering to pay for. Nothing wrong with any of that.\n\nYour parents have another partner and don't want to take a big two week trip without their partner. That's fine too. It's not even an issue to ask if you would be open to them paying so Mary can join. They can also decline to go if they don't like the trip you have in mind. All of this should be able to be handled maturely.\n\nThe only AH type behaviour is your parents and Mary being upset AT you. They can feel upset generally, but that doesn't mean you have done anything wrong and Mary calling to try and ask why you don't want her to come instead kind of sucks. It should be pretty simple to understand that sometimes kids just want to spend quality time with their parents without any step-parents around. \n\nIf you don't end up getting to take your parents to your home country, I hope you end up going with your daughters instead. I'm sure they would love to be shown it by you.", "NAH.  I understand your opinion, and I kind of think that since you are paying, you do get final call on who gets to go.  And since you aren't taking your daughters either, it's not like you're excluding just Mary.  But, I will say that, even though you say you don't care about what type of relationship they have, it kind of seems like you do.  Now, you certainly don't have to consider her as any kind of parental figure, and it doesn't sound like anyone expects you to.  But, this person is a very important person in your parent's lives, and it sounds like they do consider her family.  I hope you all can work it out!", "NTA.  You made them a generous offer for one specific trip with the three of you.  As with any invitation, they get to say yes or no.  They said no.  They don't get the credit for the trip you offered to apply to another trip that they want with an extra guest.  You aren't a travel company.\n\nIf I offer you a Starbucks coffee because I am making a trip, you don't get to demand the $7 so you can spend it towards a steak dinner that night instead.", "Nah, kind of. I get your position and they can accept it or not to be honest but you even if you dont see this person as something more than their gf sorry to break it to you but for them is an equal partner of 11 years. Its difficult and both parties had different perspective on this problem and to me at least both are valid", "Op whose the trip for ?\n\nAre you doing it for them or for you ? \n\nI get it makes you uncomfortable but it sounds like Mary is a lot more than just a GF to them - you don\u2019t gotta see it that way but if you care about them you\u2019ll reconsider allowing them to bring their life partner.", "Your parents are in a relationship they value. You may not consider that person a parental figure, but your parents consider her an equal partner in their relationship.\n\nIf one of your parents had remarried, you probably wouldn't find it appropriate to only invite them to this vacation and not their new spouse. That's essentially how your parents are viewing this relationship, as equal.\n\nIf you want your parents, you have to fully accept their partner as well. That's their condition or boundary.\n\nI guess NAH (edited to change vote). Since you are funding the trip, it's your preogative on who you want to fund, however your parents are under no obligation to accept your terms and conditions. (Like imagine how silly that sounds: I offered my parents a free vacation and they declined! They're assholes, aren't they!? Lol)", "YTA\n\nShe is someone very important to your parents who you've said cannot go home as often as they would like.\n\nThis could be the only opportunity to share their country with their loved one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are not my parent\", she's not the kind of person I'd want to have around on a 2 week trip.", "I don't judge the relationship, but the context itself maybe, she is the mother of a former great friend of mine and because of the proximity, the families became close and well, it's strange just to see the person you thought of as an \"aunt\" become girlfriend's parents  and meeting people you don't like several times a year.

They asked if they could pay for an extra guest themselves", "But their friend isn't an equal.  She is not his parent.", "NTA If op is paying to spend time with their parents, they can have a say on how this vacation turns out. Similarly if a parent funded their child\u2019s trip to visit them and wanted it to be a family thing, they can nix the girlfriend tagging along as that would change the whole dynamic. The parents should understand their child wanting to bond with them without their third, just like op is not bringing their daughter.", "If hypothetically one of the parents originally died and then remarried, but for any reason the OP had no relationship with the new spouse, it would 100% be appropriate to invite only your actual parent to a trip in my opinion", "Yes, I'm just saying that on this trip I prefer just the 3 of us, but that on a future trip (probably next year) she would be welcome and my daughter too.", "Did you skip through the entire parts where the OP said they can have another trip together with everyone in the future?", "It feels weird because it is weird.

Not just some gf like op makes it sound , they live together for 11 years lmao", "If your parent remarried, and you were getting married, would you invite only the parent to the wedding and actively not invite their spouse?\n\nLike there are certain situations where you could choose not to include a person's spouse, but imo that makes you an asshole/childish.\n\nAlso, even if you can do it, it doesn't make your parent obligated to attend. Many people choose to decline invites when their partner is intentionally excluded.", "Its not the same\n\nYou can return home for the first time. A different trip will just be a vacation.", "Id still consider not inviting their new spouse to my wedding IF it was an intimate ceremony with only close family and friends AND i had no relationship with them at all as is the OP\u2019s case. Agree to disagree on it being childish or assholish. I agree that the actual parent can definitely decline though.", "A wedding or a traditional holiday celebration isn\u2019t the same as a vacation. OP doesn\u2019t have to justify why he wants only his parents to come along any more than my mother, happily married to our father,  had to justify why she once took my sister and me on a \u201cgirls only\u201d trip. It\u2019s normal for parents and children to want to spend some quality one on one time with each other.", "If I was getting married? Yeah. I'd absolutely invite my parent's new spouse. If I'm paying for a destination birthday party for me and people I consider family? Nope. My money. My trip. My choice. They can say no, but that's on them, not me."]}
