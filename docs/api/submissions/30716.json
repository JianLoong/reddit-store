You are a friend of my parents. You are not MY family. This vacation is about MY family. I'm not excluding you, it isn't a dislike of you. There are lots of people I like and even love, who aren't coming, like my daughter, for instance. This isn't about you. It's only weird if you try to make it about you. Just stop, let it go. The larger group of friends and family can be another time.", "NTA...You don't have to travel with anyone you don't want to.  Your parents (and Mary) can accept that or not.  You will have to accept their decision.", "Messy, but I'm going with NTA.  Explain that you want to spend some time with just your parents, and if they can't accept that then you will respect their choice and not go.  \n\nWhether you still pay for the two of them to go is interesting.  Whether they accept, whether they pay for their friend, whether they ask you to pay for their friend, whether they get embarrassed for their selfishness, would be interesting to learn.", "NTA, op even if it was only your mother and a step parent you didn\u2019t know much at all i think its fine. They don\u2019t have to go if they don\u2019t want to leave Mary behind, Mary should listen to your point of view and be annoyed with your parents instead. I think its a lovely idea and if your parents want to pay for themselves to go another time as a whole family then thats okay too and you should take someone else that you care about and enjoy the holiday.", "NTA, you aren't taking your daughters. Sounds like they like the idea of the free trip but not with just you. I'd say never mind and you all travel separately on your own in this case.   Mary isn't your relative, as you've said, she's your parent's girlfriend. If you can leave your daughters at home, they can leave their gf.", "NTA tell your parents the trip of off if they can\u2019t do a parent/child trip. It was to be a gift of your appreciation of them as parents. Mary is not a parent. Take your daughter instead.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t inviting people based on whether or not you\u2019ve argued with them. You\u2019re inviting people who have had a familial role in your life. Does Mary bring your parents on every trip she goes on? I get she doesn\u2019t want to be left behind, but she\u2019s an adult and that not an unreasonable ask. \u201cFeeling left out\u201d is not a good reason for a grown up to insist on getting their way.", "NTA  you have a right to a trip with just your parents, especially since you\u2019re paying for it. As you\u2019ve pointed out, your daughter isn\u2019t even going.", "NTA as long as you accept that they can justifiably chose not to go now. People don\u2019t want to leave behind their partners for trips, just as people don\u2019t want to go on family trips with people they don\u2019t consider family.\n\nYou may have to accept that this trip you want with your parents may never happen and no one\u2019s necessarily the bad guy for that. It is what it is.", "NTA.  Time to cancel the plans altogether.  They can stay at home with Mary, or pay for the three of them to go without your involvement.", "NTA. You're not even including your own child. \nGirlfriend can Facetime and prepare for the FAMILY trip you already discussed.", "NTA. Your parents are weirdos.", "NTA\n\nRegardless of how your parents feel about her, or how long she's been in their lives, you explicitly made it clear that you wanted only you and your parents on this trip. To the point that you're not bringing *your own* children.\n\nOn top of that, the guilt trips, especially Mary calling you and accusing you of having a problem with her, is immature and petty.\n\nWhether Mary likes it or not, her having a relationship with your parents does not entitle her to be treated like a parent or included in things you only want your parents there for. Whether your parents like it or not, you do not have to accept Mary as a third parental figure or extend her the same considerations. And they are asking you to extend her the same considerations because they want her to go on what is supposed to be a Parent-Child trip, even if they do pay for her part.\n\nIf they want to share this experience so badly that they're willing to put their girlfriend above their child, then they can go on their own. You still go and take your daughter instead. Then it's still a parent-child trip, your just shifting the generations down since the generation above can't figure out that their partner is not one of your parents.", "NTA though somewhat leaning towards NAH.\n\nYou have 2 parents and you want to have a meaningful experience with them that you are willing to pay for. You have made it clear that other people who are family are welcome on other trips (including Mary), but that is not what you want for this trip that you are planning and offering to pay for. Nothing wrong with any of that.\n\nYour parents have another partner and don't want to take a big two week trip without their partner. That's fine too. It's not even an issue to ask if you would be open to them paying so Mary can join. They can also decline to go if they don't like the trip you have in mind. All of this should be able to be handled maturely.\n\nThe only AH type behaviour is your parents and Mary being upset AT you. They can feel upset generally, but that doesn't mean you have done anything wrong and Mary calling to try and ask why you don't want her to come instead kind of sucks. It should be pretty simple to understand that sometimes kids just want to spend quality time with their parents without any step-parents around. \n\nIf you don't end up getting to take your parents to your home country, I hope you end up going with your daughters instead. I'm sure they would love to be shown it by you.", "NAH.  I understand your opinion, and I kind of think that since you are paying, you do get final call on who gets to go.  And since you aren't taking your daughters either, it's not like you're excluding just Mary.  But, I will say that, even though you say you don't care about what type of relationship they have, it kind of seems like you do.  Now, you certainly don't have to consider her as any kind of parental figure, and it doesn't sound like anyone expects you to.  But, this person is a very important person in your parent's lives, and it sounds like they do consider her family.  I hope you all can work it out!", "NTA.  You made them a generous offer for one specific trip with the three of you.  As with any invitation, they get to say yes or no.  They said no.  They don't get the credit for the trip you offered to apply to another trip that they want with an extra guest.  You aren't a travel company.\n\nIf I offer you a Starbucks coffee because I am making a trip, you don't get to demand the $7 so you can spend it towards a steak dinner that night instead.", "Nah, kind of. I get your position and they can accept it or not to be honest but you even if you dont see this person as something more than their gf sorry to break it to you but for them is an equal partner of 11 years. Its difficult and both parties had different perspective on this problem and to me at least both are valid", "Op whose the trip for ?\n\nAre you doing it for them or for you ? \n\nI get it makes you uncomfortable but it sounds like Mary is a lot more than just a GF to them - you don\u2019t gotta see it that way but if you care about them you\u2019ll reconsider allowing them to bring their life partner.", "Your parents are in a relationship they value. You may not consider that person a parental figure, but your parents consider her an equal partner in their relationship.\n\nIf one of your parents had remarried, you probably wouldn't find it appropriate to only invite them to this vacation and not their new spouse. That's essentially how your parents are viewing this relationship, as equal.\n\nIf you want your parents, you have to fully accept their partner as well. That's their condition or boundary.\n\nI guess NAH (edited to change vote). Since you are funding the trip, it's your preogative on who you want to fund, however your parents are under no obligation to accept your terms and conditions.

Maybe if they make a follow-up post lol", "I don't think OP has NO relationship with their parents' girlfriend, just not a parental figure sort of relationship", "Again, that is neither kind nor truthful. \n\nThey\u2019re not acting \u201cless than human\u201d\n\nGoodbye", "If OP wants to take a trip with just parents that\u2019s fine, but he shouldn\u2019t pretend like it\u2019s something he\u2019s doing for them when it is actually something he is doing for himself.", "If Mary comes, then OP will be the fourth wheel and have a much different trip. It sounds like you think OP just shouldn\u2019t go and let Mary go instead so OP\u2019s parents can have a romantic homecoming trip. I think they should be happy to get to spend time with their child. Parents that prioritize their romantic partner over their kids make me sick. My mom did that to me and it sucked. I\u2019m lucky that I have an awesome dad/step-mom. People shouldn\u2019t have kids if they can\u2019t give them individual time without whoever they\u2019re currently dating tagging along.", "My parents have been happily married almost 50 years. Was my mom a dick when she wanted to take a \u201cgirl\u2019s only trip\u201d with me and my sister before I got married? No. And neither is OP for wanting a vacation with just his parents.", "\n\u201cObviously. I was using other examples to elaborate on my point.\u201d\n\nAnd it was a poor example. \n\n\u201c \u2018OP doesn\u2019t have to justify why he wants only his parents to come along\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cI never said they did?\u201d\n\nNo you didn\u2019t, but you said he was being an asshole and childish. He\u2019s not.  He\u2019s just a son wanting some one on one time with his parents without other people involved, including other blood relatives. And that is perfectly fine.", "Oh right. Hmmm, well, we can only assume based on the limited information provided but my interpretation is OP\u2019s relationship with the person is minimal enough to be reasonably rounded down to practically nothing for the purpose of their post or to the hypothetical situation we have added.", "Paying for their trip and giving them a chance to spend time with their adult child who I presume is busy and they don\u2019t get the chance to spend that much time with regularly is a nice thing! The parents are just so into their relationship that they can\u2019t see it for what it is. These kind of parents always expect their kids to run and take care of them when they get too old but take s huge break from maintaining the relationship from age 18- whenever the parents start to get old/sick and need help", "You'd think they'd say, \"I have no relationship with this person. I don't hang out with them. I don't interact with them. I don't go home to my family's house because I don't want to be by them.\"\n\nThey also indicated they would be OK for a *future* vacation that includes both the parents gf and OP's own child.\n\nI'd say, based on how the parents are reacting to even the thought of going on vacation without their gf, they're including her in everything at home. Otherwise OP would have also said, \"I don't know why this is such a big deal. I take the two of them out to dinner all the time without their gf!\"\n\nSo it's actually not reasonable to round down their relationship to nothing. We only know they don't have a parent-child type of relationship, but they clearly do have A relationship.\n\nAlso, quote from the post\n\n>They are very upset and Mary called me asking if I had something against her because she felt upset that I wanted her not to go so much, but she never treated me badly or we had any arguments (true).\n\nSo they have enough of a relationship that Mary can call OP directly and is concerned that OP has a problem with her. If they had NO relationship, this call would not have happened, because Mary would already understand that OP doesn't want a relationship with her in any way. There would also not be a reminder that they've never fought or had issues before, so that's why OP's parents and Mary find this new restriction on her presence so strange and uninviting.", "You would think that. I don\u2019t.", "NTA. Speaking as a polyamorous person, I think you're actually handling the situation fairly gracefully, even considering your own issues with their relationship. \n\nYou're not telling Mary she's not part of the family at all. You're just stating you want some one-on-one time with your bio-parents this time. You just want some one-on-one time that you rarely get now as an adult with your own life and immediate family you look out for on the daily. \n\nYou're not telling them that Mary can't come on any trips ever. Just not this one. \n\nAnd that's more than fair enough. \n\nIf they cannot see that, then they shouldn't go on the trip. \n\nIf they keep trying to guilt you, cancel their tickets and take your daughter instead. Make it the bonding moment she will appreciate in the future.", "NTA she isn't your family she shouldn't be on your family trip", "NTA you are allowed to spend time with just your parents.\n\nCommunicate that it's not trying to divide their relationship or because you dislike her. It's because you would like to spend time with just your parents. Even your daughter is not joining this trip. Tell your parents the same thing. If they insist their girlfriend joins the trip, then my recommendation is to reset and maybe consider canceling and truly think about your relationship with your parents and their girlfriend. Because they see her 24/7 but bristle at spending a vacation with just you.\n\nBest of luck.", "I see both sides, I don\u2019t think anyone is an asshole, but did you really expect them not to go without her?", "damn..major YTA here\n\nyou want your parents to accept your girlfriend and or wife but wont accept theirs. do you realize that you treating their mate that way is highly judgemental and just not fair. you havent given their relationship a chance and it could come from a necessity that you do not know about that has saved their relationship. Mary might be the reason your parents are still together. She might even have done so much more that you are unaware of. i once worked with an old man with the same kind of relationship. turns out the girlfriend used to be his caregiver and it became a mutual three way relationship. she helped him with his incontinent issues and daily care routine. it evolved into a relationship where she was invaluable and all partys benefited. his kids hated her because all they were thinking of is when the old man croaks she will inherit everything. But the way they treated him, i would not even have been surprised if he left half everything or all if wife died before him\n\nyou could have said it is okay and as long as they are willing to spend some alone time with you. you cant just boot someone out who is part of their family that they love and just because it is not your acceptable lifestyle. if i was your parents i would go elsewhere rather than spend time with a kid who cannot support them.\n\ngrow the eff up man..", "ESH. You're not TA for not wanting Mary to come. Your parents are not TA for not wanting to travel without her. Your parents/Mary are TA for being upset with you for that, but the tone of the post leads me to think the upset was a two-way street and your reaction to them not wanting to travel without Mary, wasn't an understanding one.  It seems like both sides have made this a bigger thing likely due to the past.\n\nI would go to your parents and Mary and tell them you look forward to a vacation with all of them. That you were really looking forward to the opportunity to travel with just you and your parents, but understand they don't want to travel without Mary for that long. Appologize for if things came off any other way. You can leave it simply at that or maybe suggest a shorter trip with just your parents, or if Mary has ties to that area too if you all travel together but spend a few days seperate where you get one on one time with your parents, try to find some middle ground.", "I would phrase it closer to this\n\n\"I'm not trying to exclude you from my life or my parents life, and I'm really sorry if it came across that way. I want to take this trip as a way to spend time with the people who raised me specifically. In the future, I would love to plan a trip with all three of you as well as my immediate family, but I want to keep this one narrow and small.\"", "Is it any different than if he had only one parent left alive, who had a 15 year relationship with someone, and was this upset about them wanting to bring that person along? He could still honestly say he fells like they aren't a part of his family, but it would sound pretty shitty to me.", "If they've been an exclusive threesome for 15 years, I'd assume that she does take the other two on every trip. Do you habitually leave your partner at home while you're on vacation?", "Yes, it\u2019s astonishingly tone-deaf.", "Yeah, I don't think OP is the asshole but I definitely understand where Mary and the parents are coming from."]}
