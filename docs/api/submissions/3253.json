We have a 6 month old infant son. Everything was fine with my MIL \"Jackie\" up until I gave birth. She was in my home the day after I was released from the hospital to see the baby before my family did. Guess what my family wasn't coming because I didn't want anybody over for 2 weeks. After that she started randomly showing up to my house unannounced when I would continuously ask for a phone call or a text message. Nope. I soon got my son in daycare as I returned to work. She showed up during nap time waking him up. She is no longer on the list to see him.\n\nNow.. on to the story.\n\nMy son have RSV, Rhino and Adenovirus. It's been a rough few days and I havent slept much since. So we didn't go anywhere as I don't want to risk my baby getting worse. My SO and I decided it was best he not leave the house, nor should we have guests over. Well this evening his mother wanted to come by as it is sleeting. I said no. My son is sick. She only wanted to come by so she could be closer to her job as she doesn't want to drive in the snow/rain. I still said no, my son is sick. The more my SO pushed that it would only be a few minutes, the meaner I got. I'm sorry but the weather and her living far from her job are not my problem. After a few minutes my MIL started texting that I'm messed up from not allowing her to come. She starts bringing my family into it, things like they can come over whenever and stay as long as they want. Not knowing my family has respected all of my boundaries and also not knowing my family within ourselves are having tons of issues and keep a distance with each other. I asked her to not mention them as she knows nothing. She continues to do so and continues to make me angry. I wanted to rip her a new one but I just told her the conversation needed to end and blocked her. My SO says he understands where I'm coming from but that I was so rude and ugly in my delivery. But I dont think he does understand. He has never defended me. His family talks about me behind our backs. His mother has never respected any of my boundaries and continues to try to do what she wants. But this time. I. Snapped. Im tired of if. My SO and I agured. Now his clothes are all over the floor.

Your child is sick, and RSV is no joke (a relative of mine has their baby in the hospital with RSV currently) so of course as your son's mom you want to take extra precautions to protect him. \n\nI have to ask, when MIL has just dropped by unannounced, who is letting her in? or does she have a key? because it's your house and you had the power to tell her that unless she shouldn't come over unless it's prearranged or that her dropping by was inconvenient and she should schedule a time to come instead. It seems like you made a half attempt to set boundaries but the follow through could use some improvement.", "NTA. Sounds like you did what your SO should have done much sooner.

It turned out to be very beneficial to us all as she would feed me, shove me in the shower and tuck me into nap while hoisting baby around in her arms.

She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up.  She was tired of fighting and struggling.  It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose.\n\nHer mother took her to the kitchen.  She filled three pots with water.  In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans.\n\nShe let them sit and boil without saying a word.  In about twenty minute she turned off the burners.  She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl.  She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.  Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl.  Turning to her daughter, she asked, \u201cTell me what you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cCarrots, eggs, and coffee,\u201d she replied.\n\nShe brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots.  She did and noted that they were soft.  She then asked her to take an egg and break it.  After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg.  Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee.  The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma.\n\nThe daughter then asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point, mother?\u201d\n\nHer mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity\u2026 boiling water \u2013 but each reacted differently.  The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting.  However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak.  The egg had been fragile.  Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior.  But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened.  The ground coffee beans were unique, however.  After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water.\n\n\u201cWhich are you?\u201d she asked the daughter.  \u201cWhen adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond?  Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?\u201d\n\nThink of this:  Which am I?\n\nAm I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength?\n\nAm I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat?  Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff?  Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart?\n\nOr am I like the coffee bean?  The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain.  When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor.  If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you.\n\nWhen the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level?\n\nHow do you handle adversity?", "It really, really is.
