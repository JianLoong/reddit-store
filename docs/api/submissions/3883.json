Her boyfriend has a son(14) who he has joint custody of (One week with him, one week at his mother's house).   \nThe house they are living in has 3 bedrooms, two on the main floor and 1 in the basement.   \nMy cousin has the second main-floor bedroom as her home office. It's where she works and is a comfortable space when she's feeling overloaded.   \nHer boyfriend's son has spent time at her house before and typically slept on the living room couch. The plan was for her boyfriend to move in and then when she was comfortable they'd start converting her office into a bedroom for his son.   \nWe went out for lunch together and she broke down about losing her safe workspace. She's really worried her work is going to suffer and if she starts feeling overwhelmed she won't have anywhere to go.    \nI suggested that instead, she convert the basement bedroom into a space for the son. As a teenager, he'd have more privacy and there's a bathroom down in the basement that could be all his own. My cousin got really excited about this idea and now is insisting to her boyfriend they do what I suggested. However, the basement isn't in the best shape. They probably wouldn't be able to have the bedroom fully set up until February.   \nHer boyfriend has been blowing up my phone telling me I'm an asshole to have suggested this. Saying he knows how my cousin struggles with change but his son NEEDS a bedroom now and my cousin just WANTS to keep her office.

The boyfriend may be overreacting to this suggestion, there are other solutions. Why not go without an office for a few months and then get that setup in the basement?

Much like that, I'm sure your friend has some of these same issues, getting sensory overload, etc, that make her need for a safe space for herself just that, a need. I get that the kid needs a bedroom, but at the same time, this is something that can be worked around and make accommodations for both needs.", "NTA\n\nBf WANTS to move in to save on rent and costs.

It is possible your cousin does not see the red flags. She seems so focused on trying to be accommodating to what he wants and how to blend those requirements with her own needs that she may not be \"reading between the lines\" that the reason he wants to move in with her is so he can live rent free and take advantage of her financial situation. He is a mooch.\n\nIf this is going to work, your cousin needs to set boundaries and enforce them. She needs to make it clear to this man and his son that it is HER house and they will not dictate things under her roof. She needs to make bf pay rent. Maybe look at getting a tenancy agreement or something. She needs to make it clear that her home and needs (e.g. space, sensory) are to be respected, not belittled. \n\nIf this man cares about her, he will want her to be happy and comfortable in her own home and he will respect and support her needs and boundaries. If he is unable or unwilling to do so, she needs to tell him that he cannot move in, and consider ending the relationship.", "NTA - her boyfriend sounds controlling and entitled. She isn\u2019t suggesting that the kid sleeps in the street - she\u2019s offered a reasonable compromise.

Your cousin needs to put the breaks on.  HE is the AH", "She inherited the house from her parents when they passed away in 2016 so no mortgage payments. She covers the utilities at the moment but her boyfriend is covering most of the food for the house as well as 50% of the internet bill. They are planning on switching to 50/50 for everything in January.", "Not minimal rent \u2014 he wants to pay ZERO rent!", "Why is that?", "The ex wife isn\u2019t wrong.

He will be freeloading (only paying 1/2 of utilties and food)", "She agreed to no rent if she kept her office. He wants to change the deal", "Aahh ok missed that part. Hmm then yea he need to pay something more temporarily but if she don't say something then he wont", "NTA\n\nBut the kid does need a bedroom. Not \u201cneed\u201d in quotes, he needs it for real. That being said, that\u2019s on his dad, not your cousin. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t really sound like they took their time moving in together. It sounds like they rushed before the kid\u2019s room was even ready.", "I find all the responses interesting. Of course it\u2019s her house, but she invited him to live with her. When my now ex moved in, we started to make decisions regarding the house jointly. It wasn\u2019t just \u201cmy\u201d house anymore even though legally it was. Regardless of how she feels about that, the kid deserves to not wait two months for a room. This also should\u2019ve been decided and adjusted before anyone moved in so that ship has sailed. Your cousin can switch her workspace to the basement. As a teacher, I\u2019ve had kids who slept on the couch at one house for various reasons, but it never went well. Almost always there ended up being a lot of resentment towards the parent and step-parent/partner because of it. I had a few cases where the child ended up choosing to only live in one home because of it too. I would be very angry if I found out my teen daughter was sleeping on the couch every night she\u2019s at her dad\u2019s. However, I also would never move in somewhere until her bedroom was all set up and ready to go. \n\nSo you\u2019re NTA for suggesting it at all. But your cousin\u2019s insistance on this being the only plan and the boyfriend\u2019s lack of making sure his son has a bedroom makes them both AHs.", "Not the substance of the issue, but want to affirm that I think most teens would prefer the more private basement room with its own bathroom.\n\nNTA and I think this can end happily for everyone!", "NTA and her office is a NEED, not a want. She needs an office for work and as a safe space. Her boyfriend is an AH for demanding it be taken away from her in her own home. If he doesn't understand the importance of her having a safe space, then he really shouldn't be moving into her home.", "NTA \n\nBut\u2026. The boyfriend should be paying rent AND your cousin should have a prenup drawn up noting that that house is 100% hers and is not community property! \n\nYou cousin may be being taken advantage of here!\n\nShe should keep her bedroom and her office. It is her house. And they can easily convert to basement to something for a 14 year old.", "OP you're NTA.   Sounds like cousin and BF did not think things completely through and rushed into living together.  The plan for the son to sleep on the couch for an indeterminite length of time until cousin becomes comfortable (which in itself is another illdefined metric on when that will be reached) was massively unfair to the son.  He deserves his own bed and personal space when at Dad's.   I don't blame the ex for making a stink.\n\nI'm not clear on what the plan was for her office/safe-space after they converted the current on to the son's bedroom.  Was the plan for her to move it to the basement or was she just going to have to do without?\n\nAnd her having safe-space is not a \"want\" it is absolutely a \"need\" especially for an autistic person and a partner of an autistic person absolutely needs to understand and support their partner.\n\nI'm getting some red flags on the boyfriend.  He seems more interested in reducing his housing costs than his son's or partners needs.  Add in that your cousin didn't feel comfortable talking to him about her needs and kept it inside till she literally broke down at lunch with you and he is now \"blowing up\" your phone instead of trying to find a solution that meets both of your cousin and his son's needs is worrisome", "NTA  - OP, your suggestion is smart and perfectly reasonable.   I worry about your cousin, though.  BF /  son are moving into your cousin's house and just kind of taking over. BF's attitude that her needs and comfort don't matter in her own house - yowza, that's entitled.", "Nta I feel like this boyfriend is taking advantage of her keep an eye on the situation", "NTA!", "As an autistic person please don't let her lose her safespace that is so important to have. NTA", "NTA keep standing up for her!", "Since there aren't a lot of bills why can't the boyfriend pay to get the basement converted now?  Or has this been explored and they can't find a contractor until February?  Boyfriend shouldn't have even been trying to move in before this was cleared up.  If I were your cousin I just wouldn't even entertain the idea of having them move in until the basement was done, so no, you're NTA and good on you for encouraging your cousin to stand up for herself and her own needs.", "Look. You\u2019re NTA. And I agree with the commenters that say there was a lack of communication and advocating for needs here. But my heart also goes out to the kid forced to sleep on a couch every other week. I wonder how he feels. Will he want to keep coming over if he gets a real bed at his mom\u2019s and is forced to sleep on the couch when with his dad? The dad should have made better plans - yes. I don\u2019t think anyone is really disagreeing with that. But I think there needs to be a very serious conversation between the cousin and the bf about what she needs, what the son needs, what is reasonable expectations for everyone, and how to find a middle ground. Do I think she should convert her office tomorrow? No. Do I think she could maybe consider converting the basement to a safe space? Yes. As long as she can work (internet and all that) down there, I would almost think that would be preferable. A whole floor for her to be away when she needs it. Also finances sound like they need to be discussed. Until the basement is done in feb, what is a good compromise?", "slight YTA, if she wants to be in a relationship with a guy with a kid, then she should find a way to adjust to it that doesn't take months, otherwise she's not ready to live with someone in his situation.", "ESH, its interesting that she's grown enough to choose to have a relationship and move her bf and his kid in, but she's too fragile to deal with the daily issues that result.\n\nShe doesn't get to have it both ways and she needs to either own the choices she's making or cancel the move in.", "I understand your cousin\u2019s struggles, but she willingly chose to have a boyfriend that has a son move in with her, and the bf is right that if that\u2019s going to be his home too, then his son needs a proper bedroom. If she\u2019s not ready to adapt to this, and it\u2019s understandable that she isn\u2019t, then she shouldn\u2019t be moving people into her home. And of course you\u2019re NTA for making a good suggestion. The bf is an AH for blowing up your phone about something that\u2019s not really on you, but he\u2019s not an AH for wanting his son to have a proper space in his home.", "NTA. At the end if the day the bf and his kid are moving into someone else's home, so he really doesn't get to demand anything, especially when he knew that just the moving in part was a big step for your cousin.

Do you have any other family you can loop into be supportive of her?", "The ex-wife does have a valid complaint. Relegating your child to the couch is absolutely inappropriate.

If he didn't want his ex harassing him....maybe he shouldn't have done something dumb *shrug*\n\nAside though.......I do find the situation a little ridiculous. There are multiple ways to provide someone a sleeping arrangement without finding room to shove a bed. Fold out couches. Daybeds. Futons. Camp cot beds. Air mattresses. Loungers. I mean......I'm just getting started here. Why are there only two options being considered? She can keep her office and still provide a proper sleeping area while the basement is renovated. If he's sleeping on a futon or something in her office even, she can give him a choice to get up for the day or go back to bed in her room....or the couch.....I dunno, he's a teen.

Lots of light, let him pick wall color and help in design. Then he will really love it and want to spend time there while you're working. It sounds like the move in was too fast. Don't give up your sanctuary. Let fiance and son do whatever they can for conversion. Whatever you trust them to do. That gives them bonding time.", "NTA.  His response shows he doesn\u2019t understand or prioritize her issues", "ESH.

Dad sucks for not insisting that the son needs his own space immediately.

Even though the basement isn\u2019t ready yet, and won\u2019t be for a while, couldn\u2019t a bed or something still be put down there for her bf\u2019s son or is it in such bad shape that it\u2019s completely unlivable?", "Op you are SO NTA. As an autistic person, having a safe space is so important when it comes to preventing meltdowns/shutdowns especially if your cousin gets overwhelmed easily. Your cousin just \"want\" to keep her office, having a safe comfortable space to work and to stay when she's overwhelmed is INCREDIBLY important. It's not like his son won't get his own bedroom, it'll just take a little longer.

Is he excited to have more privacy in a basement room? Or is he losing sleep not having a proper bed? I think his experience makes a big difference here since that\u2019s what his dad is saying the problem is", "The thing is, for someone with autism,  a safe, quiet space is something they need, it's not just a want. If he doesn't understand that, this might not be the best situation for her to be in? Has anyone bothered to ask the kid?

NTA that relationship is doomed", "NTA. And there\u2019s a few red flags about the boyfriend. She owns a house and a man to whom she\u2019s not married is to live there for free?

Incidentally, this is pretty standard", ">Dad sucks for not insisting that the son needs his own space immediately.\n\nBy the sounds of OP's replies dad's been slowly moving in over the past year, he had all that time to make arrangements for his kid but didn't. \n\nCousin obviously *needs* her office to combat burn out and meltdowns so I think the office to bedroom idea is out the window but I'm just baffled that it's been months and no one has thought of a good solution!\n\nEdit to add: Dad really sucks for pretty much not caring about his kids living conditions sooner.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Right???

Because he seems very unfamiliar with what that actually entails\u2026", "And that\u2019s a him problem, it would\u2019ve been different if he took OP\u2019s advice well.

A good partner could help her so much more, but this guy is not really it.", "This is what I was thinking. As a minor teen, my sibling finished a basement in a few months. I\u2019m sure an adult man who\u2019s saving a good bit of money by moving in with OP can fix up a basement in a month. If it\u2019s full of stuff, hire movers and get a storage space. \n\nI do kinda wonder why this hadn\u2019t occurred to them before, though? They were together three years and cousin works from home, so I don\u2019t really see why BF thinks cousin doesn\u2019t need an office.

At a minimum, she needs to see a lawyer about protecting her property rights.", "Most of the food and half the internet. Where does your cousin live? I might be willing to spring for the ENTIRE internet bill for a basement with my own bathroom.\n\nPS NTA, your cousin has concerns about work suffering; an autistic person has even more worries than someone who isn't neurodivergent about work accommodations or losing their job. The bf needs to take all that money he is saving on rent and other living expenses and pay to get the basement fixed up for his kid, or he needs to make other living arrangements for himself and his child.", "I really don\u2019t know how to explain this in a way that would make sense to a NT person, but safe space is not a flexible thing.\n\nMoving her safe space to the basement under duress would make the space inherently unsafe, because the creation of the space originated in an unsafe way. \n\nMy safe space is my bed, and as much as it drives my partner batty, I spend a ton of time in bed because I feel safe and comfortable. Any attempt made by someone other than me to create an alternate safe space has resulted in higher stress and higher need for a safe space.
