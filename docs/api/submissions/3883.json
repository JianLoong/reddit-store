Her boyfriend has a son(14) who he has joint custody of (One week with him, one week at his mother's house).   \nThe house they are living in has 3 bedrooms, two on the main floor and 1 in the basement.   \nMy cousin has the second main-floor bedroom as her home office. It's where she works and is a comfortable space when she's feeling overloaded.   \nHer boyfriend's son has spent time at her house before and typically slept on the living room couch. The plan was for her boyfriend to move in and then when she was comfortable they'd start converting her office into a bedroom for his son.   \nWe went out for lunch together and she broke down about losing her safe workspace. She's really worried her work is going to suffer and if she starts feeling overwhelmed she won't have anywhere to go.    \nI suggested that instead, she convert the basement bedroom into a space for the son. As a teenager, he'd have more privacy and there's a bathroom down in the basement that could be all his own. My cousin got really excited about this idea and now is insisting to her boyfriend they do what I suggested. However, the basement isn't in the best shape. They probably wouldn't be able to have the bedroom fully set up until February.   \nHer boyfriend has been blowing up my phone telling me I'm an asshole to have suggested this. Saying he knows how my cousin struggles with change but his son NEEDS a bedroom now and my cousin just WANTS to keep her office.

The boyfriend may be overreacting to this suggestion, there are other solutions. Why not go without an office for a few months and then get that setup in the basement?

Much like that, I'm sure your friend has some of these same issues, getting sensory overload, etc, that make her need for a safe space for herself just that, a need. I get that the kid needs a bedroom, but at the same time, this is something that can be worked around and make accommodations for both needs.", "NTA\n\nBf WANTS to move in to save on rent and costs.

It is possible your cousin does not see the red flags. She seems so focused on trying to be accommodating to what he wants and how to blend those requirements with her own needs that she may not be \"reading between the lines\" that the reason he wants to move in with her is so he can live rent free and take advantage of her financial situation. He is a mooch.\n\nIf this is going to work, your cousin needs to set boundaries and enforce them. She needs to make it clear to this man and his son that it is HER house and they will not dictate things under her roof. She needs to make bf pay rent. Maybe look at getting a tenancy agreement or something. She needs to make it clear that her home and needs (e.g. space, sensory) are to be respected, not belittled. \n\nIf this man cares about her, he will want her to be happy and comfortable in her own home and he will respect and support her needs and boundaries. If he is unable or unwilling to do so, she needs to tell him that he cannot move in, and consider ending the relationship.", "NTA - her boyfriend sounds controlling and entitled. She isn\u2019t suggesting that the kid sleeps in the street - she\u2019s offered a reasonable compromise.

Your cousin needs to put the breaks on.  HE is the AH", "She inherited the house from her parents when they passed away in 2016 so no mortgage payments. She covers the utilities at the moment but her boyfriend is covering most of the food for the house as well as 50% of the internet bill. They are planning on switching to 50/50 for everything in January.", "Not minimal rent \u2014 he wants to pay ZERO rent!", "Why is that?", "The ex wife isn\u2019t wrong.

He will be freeloading (only paying 1/2 of utilties and food)", "She agreed to no rent if she kept her office. He wants to change the deal", "Aahh ok missed that part. Hmm then yea he need to pay something more temporarily but if she don't say something then he wont", "NTA\n\nBut the kid does need a bedroom. Not \u201cneed\u201d in quotes, he needs it for real. That being said, that\u2019s on his dad, not your cousin. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t really sound like they took their time moving in together. It sounds like they rushed before the kid\u2019s room was even ready.", "I find all the responses interesting. Of course it\u2019s her house, but she invited him to live with her. When my now ex moved in, we started to make decisions regarding the house jointly. It wasn\u2019t just \u201cmy\u201d house anymore even though legally it was. Regardless of how she feels about that, the kid deserves to not wait two months for a room. This also should\u2019ve been decided and adjusted before anyone moved in so that ship has sailed. Your cousin can switch her workspace to the basement. As a teacher, I\u2019ve had kids who slept on the couch at one house for various reasons, but it never went well. Almost always there ended up being a lot of resentment towards the parent and step-parent/partner because of it. I had a few cases where the child ended up choosing to only live in one home because of it too. I would be very angry if I found out my teen daughter was sleeping on the couch every night she\u2019s at her dad\u2019s. However, I also would never move in somewhere until her bedroom was all set up and ready to go. \n\nSo you\u2019re NTA for suggesting it at all. But your cousin\u2019s insistance on this being the only plan and the boyfriend\u2019s lack of making sure his son has a bedroom makes them both AHs.", "Not the substance of the issue, but want to affirm that I think most teens would prefer the more private basement room with its own bathroom.\n\nNTA and I think this can end happily for everyone!", "NTA and her office is a NEED, not a want. She needs an office for work and as a safe space. Her boyfriend is an AH for demanding it be taken away from her in her own home. If he doesn't understand the importance of her having a safe space, then he really shouldn't be moving into her home.", "NTA \n\nBut\u2026. The boyfriend should be paying rent AND your cousin should have a prenup drawn up noting that that house is 100% hers and is not community property! \n\nYou cousin may be being taken advantage of here!\n\nShe should keep her bedroom and her office. It is her house. And they can easily convert to basement to something for a 14 year old.", "OP you're NTA.   Sounds like cousin and BF did not think things completely through and rushed into living together.  The plan for the son to sleep on the couch for an indeterminite length of time until cousin becomes comfortable (which in itself is another illdefined metric on when that will be reached) was massively unfair to the son.  He deserves his own bed and personal space when at Dad's.   I don't blame the ex for making a stink.\n\nI'm not clear on what the plan was for her office/safe-space after they converted the current on to the son's bedroom.  Was the plan for her to move it to the basement or was she just going to have to do without?\n\nAnd her having safe-space is not a \"want\" it is absolutely a \"need\" especially for an autistic person and a partner of an autistic person absolutely needs to understand and support their partner.\n\nI'm getting some red flags on the boyfriend.  He seems more interested in reducing his housing costs than his son's or partners needs.  Add in that your cousin didn't feel comfortable talking to him about her needs and kept it inside till she literally broke down at lunch with you and he is now \"blowing up\" your phone instead of trying to find a solution that meets both of your cousin and his son's needs is worrisome", "NTA  - OP, your suggestion is smart and perfectly reasonable.   I worry about your cousin, though.  BF /  son are moving into your cousin's house and just kind of taking over. BF's attitude that her needs and comfort don't matter in her own house - yowza, that's entitled.", "Nta I feel like this boyfriend is taking advantage of her keep an eye on the situation", "NTA!", "As an autistic person please don't let her lose her safespace that is so important to have. NTA", "NTA keep standing up for her!", "Since there aren't a lot of bills why can't the boyfriend pay to get the basement converted now?  Or has this been explored and they can't find a contractor until February?  Boyfriend shouldn't have even been trying to move in before this was cleared up.  If I were your cousin I just wouldn't even entertain the idea of having them move in until the basement was done, so no, you're NTA and good on you for encouraging your cousin to stand up for herself and her own needs.", "Look. You\u2019re NTA. And I agree with the commenters that say there was a lack of communication and advocating for needs here. But my heart also goes out to the kid forced to sleep on a couch every other week. I wonder how he feels. Will he want to keep coming over if he gets a real bed at his mom\u2019s and is forced to sleep on the couch when with his dad? The dad should have made better plans - yes. I don\u2019t think anyone is really disagreeing with that. But I think there needs to be a very serious conversation between the cousin and the bf about what she needs, what the son needs, what is reasonable expectations for everyone, and how to find a middle ground. Do I think she should convert her office tomorrow? No. Do I think she could maybe consider converting the basement to a safe space? Yes. As long as she can work (internet and all that) down there, I would almost think that would be preferable. A whole floor for her to be away when she needs it. Also finances sound like they need to be discussed. Until the basement is done in feb, what is a good compromise?", "slight YTA, if she wants to be in a relationship with a guy with a kid, then she should find a way to adjust to it that doesn't take months, otherwise she's not ready to live with someone in his situation.", "ESH, its interesting that she's grown enough to choose to have a relationship and move her bf and his kid in, but she's too fragile to deal with the daily issues that result.\n\nShe doesn't get to have it both ways and she needs to either own the choices she's making or cancel the move in.", "I understand your cousin\u2019s struggles, but she willingly chose to have a boyfriend that has a son move in with her, and the bf is right that if that\u2019s going to be his home too, then his son needs a proper bedroom. If she\u2019s not ready to adapt to this, and it\u2019s understandable that she isn\u2019t, then she shouldn\u2019t be moving people into her home. And of course you\u2019re NTA for making a good suggestion. The bf is an AH for blowing up your phone about something that\u2019s not really on you, but he\u2019s not an AH for wanting his son to have a proper space in his home.", "NTA. At the end if the day the bf and his kid are moving into someone else's home, so he really doesn't get to demand anything, especially when he knew that just the moving in part was a big step for your cousin.

If he didn't want his ex harassing him....maybe he shouldn't have done something dumb *shrug*\n\nAside though.......I do find the situation a little ridiculous. There are multiple ways to provide someone a sleeping arrangement without finding room to shove a bed. Fold out couches. Daybeds. Futons. Camp cot beds. Air mattresses. Loungers. I mean......I'm just getting started here. Why are there only two options being considered? She can keep her office and still provide a proper sleeping area while the basement is renovated. If he's sleeping on a futon or something in her office even, she can give him a choice to get up for the day or go back to bed in her room....or the couch.....I dunno, he's a teen.

They had agreed, in advance of the move, that the office room was going to be turned into boyfriend's son's room. But, according to OP, they had never talked about a timeline for this. Boyfriend probably assumed, as many people would, that his kid would have a room right away or very soon. But apparently cousin had decided, without telling anyone, that the kid would get a room \"in the new year\".\n\nNow, boyfriend moved in in November. So that's 2 months already that cousin is having this teenager sleep on the couch and have no room. And boyfriend has 50% custody, which means that the kid lives here half of his life, with zero space of his own or even a \\[bleeping\\] bed. Already, this is a frustrating situation for boyfriend and son that cousin was taking so long to give up the room she'd promised. Now, cousin is chaning the deal and saying \"neverminded he can move in the basement, but not before February\".\n\nSo cousin and boyfriend agreed that if boyfriend moved in her son would have a room, the room that used to be the office. But now that boyfriend and son are moved in (sort of, poor son, he's basically couch surfing there since he isn't allowed to move in) cousin is suddenly saying that actually the kid has to sleep on the couch and have no space for himself or his things for FOUR MONTHS (November, December, January, February). Not only is boyfriend upset his son does not have a room, son presumably is unhappy about it, but also son's mom is quite rightfully complaining as well. So this is both an uncool thing to do to this kid, and boyfriend could maybe lose custody of his child over it if he picks a women (OP's cousin) over properly housing his child. Now I understand he thought his child would have a place to stay when he moved in, but cousin basically is not keeping that. So really, boyfriend shouldn't live with her.\n\nBoyfriend should be upset. I'd honestly break up with cousin over this. If I gave up my housing to move in with my partner on the condition that my child would have a room, and then was told to wait, waited for a month, and then was told nope wait 3 more months of your kid being on the couch. And partner basically told me that their comfort mattered and my kid's didn't, and they could keep having zero space and privacy.\n\nWhether or not boyfriend is paying rent is a separate issue unless they moved in beacuse boyfriend was homeless. It seems like cousin didn't ask for rent, which is no excuse for cousin to put this kid in this position and have zero consideration for the kid's comfort. I get this is hard for cousin, and I get she didn't plan to change her mind and probably meant to keep her word when she gave it. But she dosen't seem to be thinking at all about the kid's feelings. That this might be hard for the kid too? She just dosen't seem to care at all? This kid went from having a room to living on her couch beacuse she pulled a (unplanned) bait and switch. I get there was no malice, but there's also clearly zero empathy or consideration for the child's comfort, needs, privacy, or feelings.\n\nCousin's the asshole. Though boyfriend shouldn't be calling you about it, he should dump her.", "Honestly, the way cousin expects her boyfriend to treat his son for her comfort is not okay. Maybe cousin isn't compatible with someone who lives with a child. But what you suggested and cousin is doing is not fair to the teenager.\n\nYour cousin agreed that she would turn her office room into a bedroom for her boyfriend's son. This is probably the only reason her boyfriend agreed to move in. He has 50% custody of his son and it would be irresponsible of him to move in someplace his son no longer had a room just to be with a women.\n\nNow your cousin is saying that they never agreed on a timeline and she wants this poor kid to spend 4 months sleeping in the living room? (November, December, January, February.) This is not a normal assumption (that the kid would have no room for months on end beacuse she didn't promise *when* he'd get a bedroom). She is changing the terms of the agreement by which boyfriend moved in to one which most good parents would consider a deal breaker. If I gave up my lease and moved in with a man beacuse he promised to turn one of the rooms into my kid's bedroom, then he turned around and said \"I never said when, your kid has to sleep on the couch for 4 months and then move into the basement I changed my mind!\" I'd feel mislead and frankly might end things. \n\nThis child's comfort is also important. This child also has no space and no privacy. This child is the only one who had no choice in this move, and is the one cousin is making uncomfortable, not boyfriend. Everyone agreeing is basically saying screw boyfriend's son, who cares about him? It's his fault for having a dad who believed OP's cousin! \n\nYes, the boyfriend isn't paying rent. But it sounds like cousin didn't ask him to and she inherited the house and has no mortgage. He pays for most of the food, part of the bills, and most things when they go out. And, he had a place before, right? So it's not like he's incapable of supporting himself. I know a couple that lives in an inherited house and they have a similar arrangement of no rent. Neither of them is a bad person, and after 8 years they got married. I agree it's not great that boyfriend is calling you about this, you shouldn't be involved at all.

Instead of blowing up at OP, the bf could've asked his own son for input first about the options while also taking his dad's gf's condition into consideration...as they all should as it's *her* house.

Sure, his kid definitely does need a room, but what kind of parent happily moves their kid in to a place where he has to sleep on the couch for a month?

Four months sleeping on the couch is abhorrent.\n\n\nSounds like cousin and boyfriend had a plan. Cousin thought she could handle more people in her home as well as switching rooms. She can't.

Don't let them move in, worth breaking up over", "Interesting, I get the feeling that she has slowly been poisoning the kid in order so he won't move in.

Bf can lose custody time over this; it isn\u2019t trivial. This should have been fully arranged long before they ever moved in. Kid should never have been sleeping on the couch in the first place and to suggest this continues for *4 more months* is awful.", "He had that conversation before he ever moved in. I love how everyone on this thread is ignoring that they had agreed both on the son getting the room and the financial arrangements before the move, and calling the boyfriend unreasonable and a moocher, when the OP's cousin is the one who is going back on her word. I don't blame her completely, some things are hard to calculate beforehand, and her solution might not be unreasonable, depending on the condition of the basement. But he isn't to blame either for pointing  that spending a ton of money to fix up the basement while his son spends 4 months on the couch isn't what he agreed on, and not being willing to agree to the change. He definitely sucks for blaming the OP, though, they just made a casual suggestion and aren't responsible for their cousin, again, going back on her word.", "He needs to be paying more. His son is also a factor they should be considering for bills. He uses electricity, water, eats their groceries. Her boyfriends needs to at leastt pay 65% when it comes to those bills. Otherwise he will be making a profit off of her", "Why would he not be covering costs for his kid?", "Why was the basement not the first thought to begin with? They could have spent time fixing it up before he moves in with the child. Honestly the basement room sounds amazing for a teen.", "He needs to pay her some sort of rent. I don't know what the law is where you live but where I'm from, after a year or so he could claim half of the house & get it.", "Finally a sane comment. Why is everyone acting like the boyfriend moved in and forced all these changes on the cousin? They had an agreement! The cousin is going back on the agreement! Whether the boyfriend is getting such a good deal depends on whether he will contribute to home regular homeowner expenses, like maintenance and maybe taxes; but in any case, not charging your partner rent when there is no mortgage isn't inherently exploitative.", "If you live alone, it\u2019s a huge change to have not just one but two people move in with you. I think OP\u2019s cousin had no idea what she was letting herself in for. Add autism into the mix, and I think this has all been too much too quick for her. It is a big deal for anyone, and if she\u2019s really struggling, then they need to sit down and discuss it like adults. You\u2019re putting all the blame on OP\u2019s cousin, when the bf - the father of the teen and the one who is responsible or him - should have waited till the room was ready for his child before moving into his new rent free digs. It is the father\u2019s responsibility to provide for his child, not his lawyers gf\u2019s. Yes, when you date a parent you accept their child/children as a package deal, but it is HER home, she works from home and she has autism with makes changes and periods of transition very challenging. If her bf can\u2019t understand this then he\u2019s wrong for her. He should never have moved in there when there was no bed for his son. I stand by that as a parent myself - having my child\u2019s room ready and the living room and kitchen ready was my condition for moving into my new home. My child\u2019s comfort comes first.", "Is she allowed to break up with the boyfriend or is that too mean because then she would leave them homeless?  \nOr is she required to provide 30 days notice pending other living arrangements? \nSounds like the dude is saving a ton of money on rent and should pay to get the basement finished faster. He seemed to give up his place very quickly, considering he knew there wasn't a place for his son to sleep. Seems like moving in faster was more important than his son's comfort. Guy not paying for his place to live is making a lot of assumptions", "why are you being downvoted for just asking a question and for perhaps wanting to learn why?  wow.", "It was. It was decided the boy would get the office as his room. I\u2019m sure it was a condition of him moving himself and child in.", "I think this is a great summation. \n\nAll of this should have been fixed before they moved in which is entirely on the bf's shoulders.", "The arrangements were that his son is going to get the office.

I bet at least another full month. \n\nI don\u2019t care if she\u2019s autistic\u2026children come first. Everyone knows that. It doesn\u2019t matter if you feel uncomfortable that child\u2019s needs are first.", "Obviously, people are allowed to break up. I actually said they should probably break up?\n\nI'm not sure how much time she is \"required\" to give, but if I was breaking up with someone I lived with I'd probably try to give them some reasonable amount of time to find a new apartment/lease. Like it's poor form to say \"be out tomorrow\" if they didn't cheat or something.\n\nI understand he is saving money on rent, but I'm not sure how that's relevant to cousin changing her mind on the kid having a room? It sounds like cousin didn't ask for rent from her boyfriend? I probably wouldn't have asked for rent from my live in boyfriend if I owned a house with no mortgage. Two of my best friends were a couple like this, one moved into the other's inherited home and was not charged rent. They have now been married for 8 years, and I don't consider either of them a mooch. I'm not saying it would be wrong of cousin to ask for rent, but if she didn't, I don't think it automatically reflects poorly on boyfriend he's not paying? He also had a home before where he provided his son with a room, so he clearly is capable of supporting his son and housing himself. I think assuming he moved in with cousin for her house is unfair, we don't know that. \n\nI am completely unclear why the basement would take so long. To me saying it would take 2-3 months indicates that it needs major renovations that are just time consuming. I did not assume the issue is they didn't have money to pay for it to be done? That's a bit of an odd assumption to me, but I guess it's not impossible. In my experience when you pay someone to get a room remolded it can take time even if you are paying well for it. Also, they aren't necessarily free to start a long project tomorrow, so you may have to wait on that part too. I was imagining something like the place needed insulation put in all the walls and to be completely floored, maybe more? Otherwise why is it so long? \n\nI'm not sure what \"assumption\" boyfriend made? OP states in the comments that the cousin and boyfriend agreed in advance of him moving that his son would get the room she currently has her office in. So it was worked out in advance? The issue is cousin is changing her mind and wants the kid to sleep on the couch for months beacuse of it.", "What are you talking about? \n\n1.The arrangement was NOT that she keeps her office, it was that the second room is given to the kid. And if they both assumed about the timeline, his assumption that the change would happen sooner was more reasonable than hers that the kid would spend a couple of months sleeping on the couch.\n\n2. She owns the house, sure, but she agreed to move two other people in; pulling that card AFTER they are moved in sucks. Also, he pays for most of the groceries (where I live that would be more than the utilities), he pays when they go out and he drives her around. He certainly benefits from not paying rent, but we don't have enough information to say he mooching.\n\n4. He is the provider, and he thought that he was providing by making an arrangement with his partner about housing. Maybe it wasn't a fair deal, but it was the cousin who changed her mind, and if they can't work it out she put him through a lot of trouble and expense by not realizing sooner that she couldn't give up her office.\n\n5. Is he choosing not to. He is staying with his parents, which could be a tantrum (as he seems to be blowing up at the innocent bystander OP), or it could be that he left and is looking for a new place for himself and his kid.", "Why would you suggest that to her? Because some people on here said so?\nHas she even complained about money or being taken advantage of money-wise? If not, maybe mind your own business.", "I actually wouldn\u2019t suggest he pay rent. \n\nThey had an equitable 50/50 deal to pay utilities,  they had a deal to make the room for his kid until she reneged on it, she doesn\u2019t pay any mortgage or rent so his being there will not be costing her financially.\n\nNot all partners want to turn their relationships into landlord/tenant transactional ones. If she wants him to pay, they should move into a new home that they can both pay towards owning, instead of charging him to live in the relationship home.", "He should pay rent, or pay for every single expense in the house \u2014 light, heat, wifi, food.", "She needs to actually calculate how much groceries and all the other house bills were before they moved in to now. He needs to be paying the difference on that, currently she is indeed paying more if they\u2019re splitting 50/50 bc his son is also eating and using lights/water/etc. those all add up and she is definitely paying more than she was before.

She\u2019s losing money and he\u2019s saving money, to her she probably hears 50/50 and thinks yeah there\u2019s 2 adults paying so that\u2019s fair. Except that his son is not her responsibility and his dad should be paying for it. He\u2019s also not paying rent and that\u2019s solely bc she\u2019s the owner of the house, it only makes sense to add up the dollars and it\u2019s not a lot of adding up. It\u2019s like 3 bills: groceries, pg and e, and water. That\u2019s not alot of math to do", "And also when you keep your finances separate there\u2019s usually some math involved. No you don\u2019t have to add up every single little thing, but it seems pretty obvious that he\u2019s taking advantage of the situation. As a dad he already knows that having a kid costs more in all that I mentioned and he\u2019s using her lack of knowledge/her trust in him to make a quick buck. He should\u2019ve offered to pay more simply bc 1. He has a kid and 2. He doesn\u2019t have to pay rent which is a lot of money he\u2019s saving now meaning he has a lot more disposable income while ops cousin is now spending more money just to have them there", "I guess the comments from OP like \u201che has been slowly moving in for over a year\u201d and \u201che pays nothing towards the house\u201d and \u201chis son has been sleeping on the couch for over a month\u201d\n\nAll those comments allude to the guy didn\u2019t sort his sons bedroom out before moving in", "It doesn't exactly say the agreement was that he'd pay no rent in exchange for her keeping the room. However OP does say that he wouldn't be paying rent."]}
