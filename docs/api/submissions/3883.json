Her boyfriend has a son(14) who he has joint custody of (One week with him, one week at his mother's house).   \nThe house they are living in has 3 bedrooms, two on the main floor and 1 in the basement.   \nMy cousin has the second main-floor bedroom as her home office. It's where she works and is a comfortable space when she's feeling overloaded.   \nHer boyfriend's son has spent time at her house before and typically slept on the living room couch. The plan was for her boyfriend to move in and then when she was comfortable they'd start converting her office into a bedroom for his son.   \nWe went out for lunch together and she broke down about losing her safe workspace. She's really worried her work is going to suffer and if she starts feeling overwhelmed she won't have anywhere to go.    \nI suggested that instead, she convert the basement bedroom into a space for the son. As a teenager, he'd have more privacy and there's a bathroom down in the basement that could be all his own. My cousin got really excited about this idea and now is insisting to her boyfriend they do what I suggested. However, the basement isn't in the best shape. They probably wouldn't be able to have the bedroom fully set up until February.   \nHer boyfriend has been blowing up my phone telling me I'm an asshole to have suggested this. Saying he knows how my cousin struggles with change but his son NEEDS a bedroom now and my cousin just WANTS to keep her office. It's causing a huge rift in their relationship and her boyfriend is sleeping at his parents'. I'm starting to feel really terrible about it.  \nSo Reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1670098609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbphy9/aita_for_encouraging_my_cousin_to_prioritize_her/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm thinking your cousin should rethink this whole arrangement.  Her peace of mind and ability to work takes precedence over what her \"bf\" wants.  \n\nNTA  Dig your heels in here, your cousin sounds like she needs your support.", "NTA.  Your cousin broke down at your lunch and then you talked about it and your suggestion (which is completely reasonable) was the result.  You didn't force your cousin into it.  The issue here is that the bf and cousin didn't think it through completely prior to moving in (this is also reasonable).  Your suggestion does look to be the best suggestion based on the layout and ages of the son.  However, the bf is the AH for his reaction to you.  They need to find a short term solution until a long one can be found after all it is your cousins house and she needs to be comfortable whatever the solution is.", "NTA. Seems to me she NEEDS her office.", "PLEASE -- do not let him do work on basement.  Your cousin owns the house and she must avoid any actions that could result in him being regarded as an owner.   She might want to see a lawyer.  Where I live, people do get cohabitation agreements, and certainly she needs a prenup if she marries.  \n\nThis guy has some fucking nerve.  He will not be paying rent, yet is making demands.  Tell him to stay in a AirBnb or whatever till February.", "NTA. The boyfriend should his head a bit and think of the BEST solution for both his girlfriend and son. His son wouldn't mind living in the basement. If it's not in the best condition, then they can fix that. Your friend has autism so she will STRUGGLE a lot.\n\nI feel like the boyfriend is taking advantage of the fack that she has autism and is taking advantage of her. A person like that NEEDS their safe space. \n\nLet's not forget the son won't be there all the time. Also, it's HER house. AND, if she is worried so much, he can take money from his own wallet and pay for the renovation of the basement. He is a leech.", "This is her house?  I would delay BF moving in", "It sounds like she shouldn't be living with someone who has a child. If she's unwilling or unable to accommodate the son with a proper room, then she's not ready for them to be living with her. As for your suggestion, it sounds reasonable enough, but it was just that, a suggestion. The problem isn't you, it's your cousin who is just not ready for the change living with a teenager brings.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like bf is using cousin.", "NTA. She owns the house, and was nice enough to let him and his son move in. She gets to make the final decision, and if he doesn't like it, can move right back out. How dare he try to force her to give up something she does actually NEED. The Ex wife can take her son back until a bedroom is ready for him if she is so upset about it. Overall, I think the BF needs to accept he is not in control, and you might need to remind him of that fact if he doesn't back off. I'm glad your cousin came to you, I hope you can continue to help her from getting overwhelmed with all of this.", "NTA.  But your cousin doesn't sound anywhere near ready to live with someone or to live with someone who has a child.  Could your sister move her 'quiet safe' place and office to the basement, instead of  moving the teen to the basement?  That could also give her more space, it would probably be quieter (when the teen is living there) and give her a sense of space?  NOT saying that she must be the one to give up a room, just a suggestion.  Living together is a give-give scenario, compromising a lot.  This would also give your cousin her own private bathroom.  If she has this much of a hard time adjusting, maybe this relocation would benefit her more?", "NTA. Its your cousin' s home and she has the space set up for her to work. Maybe add a bed so Son isn't on the sofa. Would she be able to work from an incomplete basement until it is refinished? With the son over half the time, it could allow a lot.of repair to be done during the mom's weeks. Son would also hopefully get to make design choices.", "NTA. i don\u2019t think your cousin is in a good relationship. he moved into HER house, and now he thinks he can say his son NEEDS this and your cousin just WANTS it? like it\u2019s her damn house you dog sit down. you did nothing wrong. the fact that her boyfriend feels validated enough to do this is alarming", "NTA you just wanted to help your cousin and made a suggestion. But these replies are being way too harsh on the boyfriend. They clearly talked and it was established that the office would be converted into his son\u2019s bedroom. Now there\u2019s a a rug pull and his son will have to stay in the living room for another 3/4 months. A teenager needs some amount of privacy. The boyfriend may be overreacting to this suggestion, there are other solutions. Why not go without an office for a few months and then get that setup in the basement? She was on board with them moving in she should want to accommodate their needs.", "I don\u2019t understand why everyone seems to think it\u2019s reasonable for a kid to have to sleep on a couch for months? He needs a room now. He lives with them half the time. She can move her work space to the basement, she\u2019s the adult.", "Speaking as an autism spectrum person myself\u2026 NTA\n\nThese aren\u2019t trivial wants where she\u2019s just being selfish. I\u2019m guessing she needs that space for her mental health way more than the kid needs the bedroom.\n\nIf the basement needs work, it seems that BF can get to work and help make that basement a livable space.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have mental health problems (different from being autistic, I realize, but I get that being neurodivergent is hard so this is relevant, I promise.) and these problems cause me to sometimes have meltdowns and panic attacks when I'm unable to be in a safe space. Much like that, I'm sure your friend has some of these same issues, getting sensory overload, etc, that make her need for a safe space for herself just that, a need. I get that the kid needs a bedroom, but at the same time, this is something that can be worked around and make accommodations for both needs.", "NTA\n\nBf WANTS to move in to save on rent and costs. Your sister NEEDS to have a safe workspace in her own home to accommodate her neurodivirgency.\n\nThis isn't a trying to be flexible in a lockdown situation or a home she shares ownership with another person. If he moves in, he needs to be paying rent for him and his son, and accept that her workspace is not available. \n\nAlternatively, he can stay renting where he is.", "NTA. Ummm\u2026.her house, her decision.", "NTA.\n\nBF is taking advantage of your cousin. He sounds incredibly entitled and controlling. He wants to move in so he can live rent free. \n\nI think your cousin is making a big mistake allowing this man and his teenage son to move in. \n\nAutistic people are at greater risk of being exploited/ taken advantage of/ abused. It is possible your cousin does not see the red flags. She seems so focused on trying to be accommodating to what he wants and how to blend those requirements with her own needs that she may not be \"reading between the lines\" that the reason he wants to move in with her is so he can live rent free and take advantage of her financial situation. He is a mooch.\n\nIf this is going to work, your cousin needs to set boundaries and enforce them. She needs to make it clear to this man and his son that it is HER house and they will not dictate things under her roof. She needs to make bf pay rent. Maybe look at getting a tenancy agreement or something. She needs to make it clear that her home and needs (e.g. space, sensory) are to be respected, not belittled. \n\nIf this man cares about her, he will want her to be happy and comfortable in her own home and he will respect and support her needs and boundaries. If he is unable or unwilling to do so, she needs to tell him that he cannot move in, and consider ending the relationship.", "NTA - her boyfriend sounds controlling and entitled. She isn\u2019t suggesting that the kid sleeps in the street - she\u2019s offered a reasonable compromise. This is caring her severe mental distress, and if the bf can\u2019t take her feelings into account, he shouldn\u2019t move in at all.", "NTA.\n\nBoyfriend is abusing your cousin.\n\nAlso, is BF paying ANY rent?!?", "NTA\n\nYou made a suggestion your cousin liked. Her boyfriend doesn't like it. This is between them now. I understand a teenager needs space. I mean he's with his dad half the time. Seems like the real solution is to get the basement done in under 3 months.", "NTA. You were just looking out for your cousin. And why is the boyfriend mad? Your suggestion made a lot of sense.", "NTA - how about them asking his son what he would prefer?? My bets are on that he would have no issue with staying on the couch a little longer to have his own room in the basement!!", "It is HER home. That room is for HER NEEDs, not wants. Her BF is a colossal AH.  NTA", "He's already moved in, Beginning of November, but he's been slowly \"Moving in\" over the last year.", "The problem is the BF who moved in too early.  Would love to hear financial arrangements.", "She might be fine with another guy with a kid.  This guy wants to move in with his kid, take her office, and pay minimal rent.  I think not a good deal for her", "Nope. As an autistic person I have to say, this whole thing was badly planned. I personally couldn\u2019t work in a basement.  All of this should have been decided well in advance but no I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that.", "No.", "That was part of my suggestions actully. Him having some input. I didn't think about the fact there wasn't room for a bed anywhere else in the house at the moment.", "They discussed the son getting a bedroom way before he moved in.  \nI just don't think they talked about a timeline properly. She was under the impression they'd start looking at the bedroom situation in the new year after she got used to them living there full time and he wants to put his son in a bedroom right now because his ex-wife is causing problems about his son sleeping on the couch.", "Or the kid can stay with him mom for a month.  In the meantime, the BF is not paying rent to OP, I would tell him to wait to move int", "1. It's her house.\n2. She is on the spectrum.\n3. Boyfriend does not pay rent.\n\nSo the mooch who doesn't pay rent doesn't get to dictate living arrangements to the owner of the house. It's inconsiderate and entitled.", "He moved too fast on this.  Your cousin needs to put the breaks on.  HE is the AH", "She inherited the house from her parents when they passed away in 2016 so no mortgage payments. She covers the utilities at the moment but her boyfriend is covering most of the food for the house as well as 50% of the internet bill. They are planning on switching to 50/50 for everything in January.", "Not minimal rent \u2014 he wants to pay ZERO rent!", "Why is that?", "The ex wife isn\u2019t wrong. The kid lives with them half of the time, a couch is not acceptable.", "A child is in fact entitled to a room lol", "So no mortgage, and he wants to pay half and get a room for his kid?  Does she understand he is the one getting the good deal.?", "And he isn't paying her any rent, I would assume...", "Yikes. \n\nThe boyfriend is definitely taking advantage of her. 50/50 is nowhere near fair or equal when she\u2019s paying for their housing AND he\u2019s bringing a teen boy into the household.", "Agree, but not OP's cousin's problem.   BF needs to pay rent elsewhere for another month", "How is this the autistic cousin's problem though?

If the other parents knows or finds out about the lack of room for the 14 year old he may have to stay with mom", "No, he isn't paying her any rent. tho from everything I'm reading maybe I should suggest that to her. He does tend to pay for most things when they are out together and he drives since she doesn't have a car. But yeah he is saving a lot of money living with her.", "And then he should either wait a month to move in (and pay rent where he is), or have kid stay with mom for that month.   Either way, he is trying to mooch off of OP's cousin.    This is not on her.", "And that's why he pissed off. The sooner a space for his son is ready, the sooner he can stop paying rent where he's been living.", "Ok but I'm just saying that could be the reason but it's a lot of what if with this. Sooo yea. Also the op sister must have agreed to no rent", "He is not paying rent to OP's cousin.   He will be freeloading (only paying 1/2 of utilties and food)", "She agreed to no rent if she kept her office. He wants to change the deal", "Aahh ok missed that part. Hmm then yea he need to pay something more temporarily but if she don't say something then he wont"]}
