The first year we were together he forgot to get me anything at all until I started crying about it Christmas Eve and he went out and got me some gifts. Last year he said the gifts wouldnt arrive until after Christmas and they just never showed up. \n\nA few days ago he told me he just ordered my gifts, and the two things he ordered me wouldn't be getting here until January. He already told me what he was getting me. One of the things is rather expensive so I don't feel like he isn't spending a lot on my financially, but I don't feel cared for. I wanted small things that showed he cared. I purposely sent him photos of inexpensive things I liked all month explicitly saying I'd love something like this for Christmas.\n\n I told him I wanted to do stockings for the first time this year and put his in an obvious spot so he could see that it'd already been filled. I asked him just now if he wanted to do mutual stockings and he said he didn't. I told him I already made him a stocking which is why I asked and he was just like \"oh, I didn't get you anything.\" \n\nI don't want to cry in front of him again and risk guilting him into getting me more things. I feel like I am an asshole for letting it bother me so much because I know one of the gifts I'm getting is pretty expensive and we're tight on money this month.  Am I being ungrateful?\n\nI wanted to edit to add that he actually hasn't ordered the expensive gift yet. He said he'd have to wait until we had more money and I was totally okay with that and said he didn't even have to get it for me. I'm not worried about monetary value I just like feeling like he actually took time and effort to make me feel appreciated. \n\nSecond edit to answer some common comments. I probably didn't make it that obvious but I've been explicit about my intentions the whole way through. When we talked about the gift quantity I asked him if I should get him more than the three I ordered and he said yes because he was going to get me a lot. When I said I wanted to do stockings I asked him if he wanted to do them with me and he said yes. When I didn't see any presents for me weeks ago I asked him when he planned on ordering gifts because they might not get here in time and he said he planned on ordering them when he had money (and then bought baulders gate for himself a few days later.)  I was communicating, but because in our communication he said the reason he wasn't getting me gifts yet was because he didn't have the money yet, I have just been trying to be patient with him.

Stop buying him shit, my goodness. How much more does he have to do to show you he does not reciprocate? The whole 'Oh it's arriving after Xmas' this is childish and tired, and I hope you realize this - just deceptive. This is the THIRD YEAR of this shit? My friend, I'm going to tell you what maybe isn't sinking in... YOU buying HIM gifts is not doing a THING to motivate HIM to get YOU gifts. \n\nI would return and / or keep the gifts you bought for him. Just say 'Year after year you make it clear you don't intend to get me anything despite our plans, and it's pretty unfair for it to be this one-sided after all this time.'\n\nDo you really wanna be with someone like this? Why is it a-ok for you to buy him gifts all throughout the month, before you have more money to spend, yet money is his reason for having only an IDEA of a gift but not an actual gift, especially given that at this rate he probably won't order it at all! Has it occurred to you that when you first asked him about gift quantities, he said he was getting you several items SO THAT you would get him several? This guy sounds like trash.", "Wait what happened to the gifts from last year? If they never showed up that means he never ordered them\u2026 right? If that isn\u2019t a giant red flag then I don\u2019t know what is.", "\u201cI wanted to edit that he hasn\u2019t actually ordered l the expensive gift yet\u201d.

It\u2019s that he\u2019s not putting in any of the emotional labor of thinking of things ahead of time. He absolutely expects you to put in the labor because he expects gifts. \n\nI recommend the book fed up by Gemma Hartley. Emotional labor is a huge issue with a lot of relationships and this imbalance will only get worse in marriage and, if you choose to have them, kids. \n\nThink about if you want to be the only one buying kids birthday, Christmas presents. The only one buying family presents for your parents and in laws. Think of waking up on Mother\u2019s Day or your own bday and finding he hasn\u2019t planned anything. Think of having to remind him to do things like this for you for the rest of your life. The hurt and emotional labor that takes. \n\nMy suggestion, beyond dumping his inconsiderate butt, is to take the presents you got him and hide them away. Tell him that you wanted to open presents together and you can both wait until the ones for you come. If he protests than ask why he should get to open his now when you have to wait. His reaction will be telling. NTA", "He never had any intention to actually get you anything. The evidence is how the last two years went.

And seriously reconsider this relationship.", "NTA. I think you are being taken for a mug. I would stop getting this guy presents this very instant. It looks very much as if he has no intention of buying you anything. He says he will and you believe him. Year after year after year. Why??", "You guys seem to have financial issues. Why are you buying so many gifts? You're adults. One gift apiece sounds fine.", "Okay, there are a couple of issues here.\n\nOn the stocking front, you said you wanted to and filled his but didn\u2019t ask him until today if he was also interested in exchanging stockings for the first time. That one was on you.\n\nOverall, though, NTA.\n\nBut this is what I\u2019d do\u2026tell him that you want to exchange gifts at the same time, so you\u2019re just going to put his stuff away until your gifts arrive.

He's happy to tell you he wants more gifts because he knows you will buy them even when he does nothing in return.  And you let him hurt you.  Stop doing this to yourself.

Then get out of this so called relationship and don't enter another one until you have aomw serious therapy to learn your self-worth.", "This seems to be a recurring issue with him. Have you told him how you feel?", "I would return all of his presents but one. I don't think he'll end up getting you anything.

He worked in a grocery store and could have easily gotten me some candy or a stuffed animal out of the seasonal aisle...or ANYTHING. He had eight hours a day to do it, but always \"forgot.\" He wasn't even a bad guy, but that was so inconsiderate and made me feel like I wasn't worth his time or thoughts when I wasn't directly in his sight. We almost got married, but luckily it didn't work out. This was over 30 years ago and it still baffles me. Please realize your worth now and move on. It's not petty or materialistic. You deserve to be thought of and cherished and this obviously isn't going to change.", "NTA why are you still with someone who can't even be bothered to get you a gift on time for a day that he has 364 days to prepare for as the date never changes and everyone is always aware its coming, not just once, but multiple times in a row?", "if he can\u2019t afford a trinket just because he bought a video game then he\u2019s beyond broke and neither of you should do more than a homemade card", "The ex would give me the bare minimum or no gift at all for Christmas or birthdays or mother's day. I thought he was a poor gift giver. This summer I finally decided to see what he was up to and went through some of his stuff. Turns out every Christmas and my birthday he would buy himself something in the area of $2,000 to 3,000. I was conditioned that I did not deserve anything and I didn't matter, very dehumanizing. When we had kids after they hit their teens I had made him in charge of the Christmas stockings for them because he was so uninvolved in them also.  I finally figured it out, he is a very selfish person that sees himself as the only person in this whole world that counts. After 37 years I am happily divorced. This year he has bought almost every gift our adult kids have put on their list. I on the other hand am more involved with doing things with them such as going out to dinner/lunch, going on a trip - things he would never think to do unless there is something in it for him. \n\nIn his eyes you are not worth buying a gift for or you would not have to fight to be given a gift - get out now. He is emotionally, mentally and financially abusing you. Abuse is not always physical.

Use your words. Communicating almost exclusively in hints rarely works.", "ESH", "NTA, but really, it's time to wake up. It's been three years, he's shown you how he does gift giving but you still expect things to be different this year. Just. Stop.

Sulk and give you the silent treatment? \n\nDoes he prioritize you and your feelings in any way, EVER? \n\nThink really hard about the answers to these questions, and why you are with him", "NTA and this won\u2019t get better, trust me.  No gift your first Christmas? second year he lies and says he ordered gifts when he obviously didn\u2019t?  Now he tells you he plans to get you 6 or 7 gifts so you buy him more, then the story changes to he ordered you a great expensive gift, well he will order it when he can afford it?  Never gonna happen, especially with a wedding to pay for.  I hate to say it, but this is a one sided relationship.  It will only get worse when you marry him.  Of course he wants to marry you, he knows most women wouldn\u2019t keep falling for his empty promises.  You can\u2019t give him enough gifts and suggestions and love to make him reciprocate.  Never gonna happen. You love a selfish lying manipulative man.  If you want to be treated better, you need a new man.", "Can you break off this engagement?  This does not sound like a good catch.  Hugs.  NTA", "The only thing you need under the tree is a new partner. What are you doing with this guy?", "You are basically the \"Skittles girl.\"  Google the story.", "NTA - is he a good partner in other ways or does all the parenting / pet care / housework get left to you also?", "Dump the dude\n.", "I would not buy him any more presents.", "Why are you with this guy? He is showing you that HE. DOES. NOT. CARE. ABOUT. YOU. You\u2019ve tried to explain how it\u2019s the thought that counts. You don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re being materialistic. My guess is that you feel his lack of care in other aspects of the relationship and this is just a flashpoint that demonstrates it perfectly. I hope that I\u2019m wrong but only you know this deep down. Listen to your intuition. NTA.", "This is not a man who is ever going to prioritize you or go out of his way for you.", "NTA, but I think he's made it abundantly clear what sort of gift-giver he's going to be and there's no point in getting upset about (I honestly doubt guilt or crying is going to have a huge impact).  If they say it's the thought that counts, ask yourself what the hell is he thinking?   It's not like Christmas just sneaks up on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Don't buy him anything.  If it's not too late, return what you did buy him and spend the money on yourself.", "Here\u2019s what me and my husband have done for over twenty years now\u2026no gifts, we book a weekend away for the two of us. You\u2019ll remember all those weekends more than some rando gift", "NTA. But you need to stop listening to his words and paying attention to his actions.  If your sister or best friend had written this what would you tell them?", "Get him a rock for Christmas. Just a rock. It could be a piece of cement instead, or concrete. Get him a rock.", "Wow. These comments have humbled me. I  was prepared to tell the OP she was being selfish for expecting gifts, because it's about giving, not receiving. I  was married for 33 years, and my husband remembered to give me Christmas presents exactly twice. He put stuff in my stocking once, he didn't fill it. So the concept of more than one present under the tree for me is so foreign to me, I can't even wrap my head around it. And there will be so many more moms on Christmas day just like me, with nothing to open. But we will the biggest smiles in the room on our faces that day.", "He\u2019s playing you I\u2019m afraid. Don\u2019t give him gifts until you actually got yours. Just turn it into new years gifts or whatever. Teach him how to treat you right, cause now you\u2019re teaching him he doesn\u2019t have to treat you right at all", "NTA. Give him one gift, return the rest, and buy something nice for yourself. And maybe think about why you're with him. If he doesn't have many other good qualities, he doesn't sound like a keeper.", "You are being used. He hasn\u2019t followed through on last years gifts and you think he will get you something this year?? You have to cry before he\u2019ll get you a gift? Relationships aren\u2019t meant to be sad, you aren\u2019t meant to beg for attention\u2026you need to dump this loser. Trust me someone will actually love and respect you but gotta dump this loser for that to happen.", "NTA\nThis very sad thing sometimes happens when you're a mom. Everyone's stocking is full except yours, Santa brings gifts for everyone except you. Kids ask if you've been naughty, and it's really tough to be okay with it because it feels like you're being a brat, but it really hurts to be left out.\nMaybe vocalize that it's really not about the STUFF, it's everything else. If he doesn't get it, then do yourself a favor and move on to someone who appreciates you.", "NTA. I had a partner like this once. Bitched at me if I spent more than 80 on groceries to fucking feed us but would pre order video games for over a hundred. I saw this man buy a galaxy phone, return it and rebuild it when a discount was released, then do it AGAIN to get a VR set thrown in with it. But yeah, fuck food. When he dumped me it was right right after I spent more money than I had on a new wireless controller set for him for valentines and he got me nothing. I took it, returned it, and when they asked why I said 'because the asshole kicked me out in that blizzard a few night ago at 10pm\". \n\nStop buying for him. He doesn't care enough to buy for you so why bother.", "YTA but only for allowing this to happen multiple years. No one forgets to get their S.O a gift. Christmas comes the same time every year. He would have been gone after the first year", "This is your future sweetie. You need to decide if he\u2019s worth this pain because he isn\u2019t changing.", "NTA. Why are you still with this guy, never mind engaged? Like other comments have said, you clearly aren't getting any gifts this year, just like the last 2 years. He just doesn't CARE. He's had ALL YEAR to look for and purchase gifts, and gives you the same excuse every year. Stop falling for it.", "Return half the stuff you bought him- no doubt he\u2019ll notice his pile under the tree shrunk, if he says anything say- I figured you just wanted to go smaller this year since there didnt seem to be anything under there for me and I already did the stocking and everything, i didn\u2019t want you to feel bad that I got so much more for you, and I figured money must be really tight and you must be really busy to not have even had time to get anything. If he gets upset or doesn\u2019t get the message, then receive the message that he can\u2019t be bothered loud and clear and don\u2019t expect anything to change (if anything it will get worse). If you don\u2019t want to return them at least hide them- make it NOTICEABLE that there is less there.", "Why do I feel like he\u2019s manipulating you into buying him more or expensive gifts and doesn\u2019t intend on actually purchasing anything . He upped the gift amount, he purposely showed you the \u201cexpensive\u201d gift you\u2019re getting. Last year your gifts just never showed up and I have a weird feeling he\u2019s doing this again to get a bunch of things he wants and not have to return the favour.. NTA", "Stop buying stuff for the guy who can't be bothered to get you anything - over multiple years. Hell I'd be taking the ones you already got right back to the store.", "Put the gifts in storage. Everytime you receive a gift from him, give him one out of storage. If his gift is going to come at some indeterminate time in the future, wait until the gift arrives to give him one in return. When he asks where are his gifts, say that it's more fun to exchange gifts at the same time so you are going to wait until his gifts to you arrive.\n\nStop being a doormat.", "OP, let me tell you a story. Started dating a guy this year that has never celebrated Christmas (from a culture that doesn\u2019t celebrate). I asked him a few months ago if he would be offended/if he minded if I bought him Christmas presents because I like gift giving. Told him he did NOT have to reciprocate. The last time he came over, he had his arms full of presents for me to open on Christmas (even though we aren\u2019t able to meet on Christmas Day). \n\nThe point is, if he cared, he would put in the effort. Why are you even accepting 3 years of less than no effort?? NTA but damn, gain some self respect.", "This exactly. Either return the gifts you bought him or throw them in the back of a closet and save them for next year. I feel so sad for you OP, you deserve someone who prioritizes you and those people are out there.", "She's not getting gifts this year either it sounds like.This happens every year,and at first he said the gifts were ordered and coming in Jan,now it's I didn't order them.", "'This guy sounds like trash',    amen.", "Yeah my sister stuck it out for 18 years, and it didn't change after divorce. Her kids are too young to do or say anything still.", "Yes, this!!", "Right? That expensive gift is never going to get ordered.", "I don't know how to C&P on here,  but,  OP, please read the last paragraph from asleep-tank3228 again.  \n\nBecause it's total BS with all his excuses. \n\nI found out today that one of my gifts I ordered won't make it before Xmas.  (The sender transposed address numbers) So,  I immediately went to Amazon and ordered something that'll arrive tomorrow.  I also went to a little local card/ gift shop and picked up something.  \n\nIt's not hard to get something,  even at this late date,  before Christmas.", "\u261d\ufe0fthis guy Christmases", "Return his gifts & buy yourself something then wrap it up and put it under the tree for yourself!", "I couldn't agree more! When you're dating he's supposed to at least PRETEND he cares.", "Thank you for this! The dude is clearly the AH here, but I don\u2019t understand why all the comments are calling out his relationship carelessness and not his financial carelessness.", "We've talked about it in the past. I have gotten gifts from him in the past but I've always felt like I give more than I get. For me \"getting\" is less about the thing and more about the intentions. I just hate that the gifts I'm getting are just the things I've had to pester him about wanting for the last six months and he didn't even try to keep my gifts a secret from me or make it so I'd actually have something to open up on Christmas. I haven't said that to him this year, but I think it'd spoil the holidays for me to have that conversation with him three days before Christmas.", "Maybe do read the post this time.", "After reading your story, I just am wondering, is your man into you at all? My husband loathed me for most of my marriage, but when I was finally like \"I'm done\" and stopped caring for him and all- that's when he started getting me gifts and flowers- but even my husband acknowledged me that he was a dick who actually disliked me a whole bunch- I kinda have the feeling like maybe your man isn't into you? And if I were you, I'd get gifts for ppl simply to do it without expecting anything in return, but um .... I wouldn't be buying him much gifts if he doesn't care to buy or receive them and I'd give gifts to my friends and family instead. I hope I'm wrong in my thinking but I can't help but feel like a man who actually likes his woman would love to surprise her with gifts????", "I couldn\u2019t care less about Xmas and Xmas presents either, but I\u2019m very aware that my wife loves Xmas. The solution is that I\u2019ll buy stuff online for myself so there\u2019s stuff under the tree and I\u2019ll buy her what she wants, we normally discuss this before hand anyway. I try if possible to make a surprise, not always possible when we buy the gift together. \nI\u2019m 60, so we tend to buy what we want anyway.", "Put the BF in storage!!", "Save them for the new BF cause this one is trash", "But...but he FORGOT to get her gifts. How that happens is beyond me.", "He\u2019s okay with your holiday being spoiled", "He is careless and hurtful. It's so clearly not about 'what you're getting' but how it rightfully makes you feel hurt that he doesn't care enough to want to do something special for you. You are NTA, but from my personal experience of being with someone for years who never got me anything for my birthday, or did anything special for me, you have to own that you are letting yourself be treated like crap by staying with this type of person. It's harsh, but I had to come to terms too, so I get it. What he is doing is a character flaw, I don't agree that communicating is going to fix this. He doesn't have that thing a partner should have that excites them about treating their sig other special--he never will. I'm sorry! You deserve better!", "Honestly, is not about the money is about the attitude, the \u201cI remembered you\u201d. If I would be you, which I was once upon a time, I would returned the gifts and buy something for myself instead. Sorry hun, but you deserve better than this. You are better than this. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel this way. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but the fact that he lied last year is even worst. I think you should have a serious talk with him, and see what\u2019s going on.", "I did, and I replied after the fact.", "Right? This says it all OP...Why are you engaged to someone that is so callous and uncaring?? I am quite sure it's not just Christmas that brings out his selfish, immature and  uncaring side of his personality.  If you can't leave this creep yet, please see a therapist and work on your self esteem. Sounds like you deserve *way* better than this selfish little man boy.", "This.  Be smarter with your life.", "Forgot=never planned on it"]}
