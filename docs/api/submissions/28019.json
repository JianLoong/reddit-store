We decided we should treat ourselves for once and go. \n\nI told my parents we going and they seemed to be happy for us at first. Then out of nowhere today they called me. Apparently my mother has been upset for days that we\u2019d even consider leaving the kids and travelling so far away. They said they weren\u2019t up to minding them at all. I said we were never going to ask them that, we had other relatives lined up. They said even so, they\u2019d still feel totally responsible for them while we\u2019re gone and if anything happened to them we\u2019d be too far away.

That is for only a days of absence. If your creche had a process like this, you can ask the trained personnel there about a week absence and what they recommend. \n\nyour risk is that your kids have a major meltdown, either with crying or with withdrawing. You are not there to help then. Your children should not have to suffer through that.\n\nI\u2018d recommend that you start training to leave your kids for a weekend, so that you can have a time out close by, in case it doesn\u2018t work with the kids over night somewhere else, and that you do the trip of a lifetime a bit later in your lifetime,when it\u2018s not a psychological risk to your kids.", "Look.

Once we were in middle school, we\u2019d stay alone (! - this was the 70\u2019s, we had close neighbors and were mature, good, responsible kids, though personally I wouldn\u2019t have left my kids alone at that age).  As teens, it was Fantastic! About the time we\u2019d all be getting on each others nerves, they\u2019d go away for a few days.  We had people to call (family, neighbors) in an emergency nearby.

If it upsets your kids to call, don\u2019t talk to them and only talk to their caregiver.  When older. Give them a calendar to mark off days until you return if that helps them understand when you will return.

You are the parents who makes the decisions for your children. Not other family members.  They are not always going to agree with your choices.  That\u2019s ok.

My core memory were having fun with my cousins until my parents came back with airport chocolate \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA - go have fun!!! Your Mom shared her opinion. Make sure things don\u2019t fall to them.\n\nYou can listen to the rest, decide whether or not it resonates - and make your own decision.\n\nIf you can\u2019t do your own thing without her butting in - then it\u2019s time to set some boundaries", "How long will you be gone for? How far is it? Are the kids used to you traveling? \nI think your mother needs to mind her own business, however I would definitely consider whether this may be a huge shock to your kids and potentially to you. I\u2019m an immigrant and I travel back home with my young kids frequently, I once had to travel home alone for a family emergency, my kids stayed with their father so I knew they were safe, however I was not prepared for how much them being on the other side of the world would effect me. Despite the fact that I had been away from them before for trips within the same country, and that they knew exactly where I was and why I went alone and they were not distressed it was still a weird feeling having them on the other side of the world from me. Just the idea that if something happened to them I was 12 hours by plane (minimum) away was extremely unsettling. \nI would definitely not be doing that again any time soon, I prefer to travel with them.", "NTA. MIL is possibly a control freak. My dad is one. This is classic dad move right here.", "NTA but your kids will both be old enough to understand what\u2019s happening, even the little one, so make sure you give them plenty of heads up and talk to them about how they\u2019re going to handle it and what you\u2019re going to be bringing back for them!\n\nI highly recommend recording a story or several for them to listen to, and maybe even getting a special lovey for each six months out that they know is going to be with them for their visit, while you go on your adventure.\n\nGood luck momma (and NTA, obviously)", "Your mom is mad because she couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t do the same.", "NTA", "I think you can do it.", "NTA at all. I would tell your parents you appreciate their concern, but we are still going. Hopefully you will be able to understand by the time we leave. \n\nAs for the \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d What if you stay home, nothing happens, and you regret missing out for the next 30 years (or whatever). Perhaps a reminder that something could happen to the kids (God forbid!) while they are in cr\u00e8che. Should you start missing work, etc to be with them?? Same thing, smaller distance, just as absurd.", "Nta and it will be fine.", "NTA, go and enjoy your trip. After the year you both had you deserve it. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nI don't have a theory why your parents don't want you to go on this trip, but I doubt that it has anything to do with your children.  Their constant moving of the goalposts is a typical sign of a hidden reason.  Take your trip & enjoy your time with your husband.", "You need time away from your kids.  Realistically something could happen to your children and your in the same house.  You cannot live your life based on what if something happens.  Go and enjoy with your husband. They will have a great time with their cousin\u2019s.", "NTA - if you're not relying on them for childcare, then it's not up to your parents", "Bring the kids with u. No child abandonment", "NTA. They're creating problems where there are none.\n\nGo and have fun!", "Your mother is raining on your parade, for whatever reason, maybe she's envious.", "NTA\n\nTell your parents ypu are going. Don't tell them who is taking care of your children.", "My parents went on a vacation by themselves once in awhile when I was a kid. Some family member would come and stay with us (later my older brother) and we would get junk food, rent movies, and have ourselves a little mini-staycation.", "Absolutely NTA! \nGood grief... you aren't even asking them to watch them! Go, have a blast. \nWe were offered the opportunity to go on an all expense paid trip with my husband's work years ago to Germany (we are in Canada) when my oldest was 3 and middle was 10m (youngest not born) i was so torn... but how do you pass it up. \n\nBest decision ever. You make arrangements that work foe YOUR family and safety and comfort... not foe your parents expectation level. This is my in laws... when we went to Germany and left the kids with my parents, they flipped, my MIL grilled me weekly leading up to it about all the safety measures, had we thought about xyz, am I sure I needed to go, maybe just my husband so go enjoy himself and I should stay home... they weren't involved in care whatsoever... but I got all the opinions since I'm mum. \n\nI definitely agree with making sure there's some build up if they haven't had jights away already... and I went to the $ store and grabbed some random small things for the kids to open if they had a sad day (and foe their cousins too so no one was left out since they spent lots of time together) and it worked like a charm for any missing mom and dad days for my 3y \n\nPlease ignore it, please go have an amazing time and let your kids have a blast having fun memories with their cousins! \n\nMy kids are now 11/9/5 And we go away for 1w every other year and a couple weekends a year and they love it. We all love each other more with some days apart. They get precious time woth grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles, and we get time solo to keep a strong healthy marriage and sanity!", "Also, make it an exciting adventure for them. Create \u201cAdvent\u201d type calendars for the days OP are gone AND stop telling her mom about it.", "They're too young for any unnecessary plane flights, and too young to appreciate anything they will see (or hear or eat), and taking them would be monumentally expensive.  \n\nYou've got the best possible childcare lined up, so time to tell your mother you're going!", "Yeah, mum has serious main character energy. It makes zero sense that the kids won't have fun with their cousins and will need to go to their grandparents.", "Some people really do think that way.\n\n\"You won't be having vacations once you have kids!\"", "Agree!\n\ni always think its good if a person has a chance to \"miss\" a family member... reminds you that you do actually love them :)", "That's a very generous interpretation considering OP will be leaving her kids with an adult family member who also has children.", "I think Mom is being a controlling old bitty. She doesn't want OP to have a vacation with her husband.", "This is a good point and you\u2019re correct. We haven\u2019t travelled much at all. We haven\u2019t even been abroad in about 6 years. We have had the odd weekend away so the kids do have experience with sleepovers or babysitters. And a lot of other relatives are going on this trip so we\u2019d be in a big group. My mother is quite an anxious person and tends to be irrational so it\u2019s not surprising she\u2019s had this reaction. I guess I\u2019m just hurt that she\u2019d blame me for her being upset and for making me feel like I\u2019m a terrible parent and question if I\u2019m being an asshole by leaving them. Which, judging by most of the comment here, I am not!", "How are they rightfully concerned? They have a plan in place, and have asked literally nothing of them. If they lost childcare for some weird reason they would probably either find new reliable childcare, or not go. According to OP because of their age they haven't asked them to watch the kids for more than two hours at a time, which is why they are not asking them to do this.", "Yea my parents didn\u2019t leave us until my brother was 14 and I was 12 for the first time but it was nice! We ate junk food, took the bus to the mall, played video games and just chilled. My brother and I get along super well though and we have family within a 10 minute drive from us if we needed them. We both had cell phones by that point so any emergency we were covered,\n\nThey did that about once a year for a while until my brother went to college and then they needed to save money. But we loved the time", "Mine went away without us every year, sometimes twice, and we always stayed with an aunt.  It was awesome!   I don't remember a year that they *didn't* go.  Me getting an evening & weekend job as teen coincided with them buying a vacation property and they started going every weekend, leaving me at home to fend for myself starting at 15, and I think that went well in part because I was used to them being gone sometimes.  Yes, that was more than before, but I knew they'd be home in 2 days, so it was fine.", "Adding to this that no one on that flight will thank OP for bringing a toddler on a super long flight. The air pressure changes and ear pain alone will make the kids miserable until their ears pop. \n\nNTA. You have family you can trust lined up. Why would your mom feel responsible for the kids if they aren't in her physical care? \n\nTake the trip. You and DH have had a difficult year. Enjoy yourselves.", "I would disagree, I travelled a lot as a child (since birth) and so have my kids (the joys of having family on the other side of the world) and I think that regardless of age it is a great experience for young kids. Maybe the two year old won\u2019t remember but the six year surely will and will be able to appreciate the trip. But in general traveling from a young age has been a huge positive in my life, so I don\u2019t think there are any unnecessary plane rides in a child\u2019s life, trips are always an enriching experience. So many parents in the US (where I live now) never take their kids anywhere that isn\u2019t designed for children and it certainly shows when those kids grow up.", "Yeah OP's parents are taking this saying way too seriously. Stressed out, exhausted parents aren't good parents either.", "My sister and my.mom, \"you would leave the country without your kids?  What if something happens?  I couldn't\".", "Doing things like sleepovers with family and small trips away from parents is literally how kids learn to sleep away from home and be away from their parents. They don't just pop up at 18 knowing how to do that. It's a thing you practice.", "When you were a kid, would your mom use her anxiety and distress as a way to control you? As in if you raised you voice or stood your ground, she would get distressed and tell you you were distressing her or crying so you would feel guilty and stop.", "Maybe do a couple practice overnights with designated caregivers to ease mom\u2019s mind. Some people are just anxious and work themselves into a panic thinking the worst. It\u2019s not your job to listen to a panic person and you are within your rights to say, we are not discussing this anymore. Then hang up or leave every time your mom brings up trip.\nGo have a wonderful trip and make memories that help you remember who you are not just \u201c mom \u201c.", "Have you told her any of this?\n\nTell her the part about how safe you'll be in a big group, and how the kids have experience with babysitters so they'll be fine, and how inappropriate it is to call you a bad mom just because she's anxious.", "Don't mind him. Redditors live in constant fear of babysitting. Everything a parent does is somehow a ploy to get them to babysit.", "First time my parents went away, without any kids\u2026 they came back pregnant!", "Id kill to have that childhood if every weekend \ud83d\ude02", "THIS. My parents took my brother and I on a trip to the other side of the world when I was 2 and he was 4, because my grandma was getting older and they wanted to take us to meet her while she was still well. During the flight, my ears hurt so badly that I cried the whole time. I was so miserable that I still remember the experience to this day and I was only 2 years old. The trip is only for 1 week and the kids will be well taken care of, so I don't see anything wrong with going.\n\nNTA", "Was next to a baby at my flight home on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was entirely miserable, even with my noise-cancelling headphones on.", "I have and will. Granted, my kids aren't small anymore. When my kids were younger (between 6 and 11), we went to Japan for 2 weeks. At the time, it was a once in a lifetime trip. \n\nSince moving to Asia, I have gone to a few different places without my kids(a couple times for work). I have also taken my kids to different countries.", "Woah. Not OP but that resonates with me so much. I always got told 'stop shouting' or 'bring your pitch down' and I never understood because I wasn't doing either. How can this impact you?", "I think this is a trauma that daughters of baby boomer mothers all share!", "I love your username in light of this thread \ud83d\ude02 nothing toxic about this enabling. \n\nOP -NTA \n\nDo some practice runs, hell go away for the weekend just the two of you a couple of times. Make sure your SIL has the proper documentation for being able to act as proxy for school/doctors/medical stuff if you\u2019re in America. Update her as a contact anywhere you might need to, make sure your passports are in date and travel insurance is comprehensive, esp in light of your husbands health, make sure any pre existing conditions are covered. \n\nWhere are you travelling to? People might be able to give you more specific advice if you say. \n\nI assume your SIL is on your husbands side and your cousin getting married is on your side? Could it be that your parents want to go too? And they don\u2019t know your SIL that well so are being judgemental?", "I rolled my eyes and said Toronto to WI is closer than CA to WI .  I trust who I am keeping them with.", "Lol. No kidding. I wouldn't fault a parent who has found appropriate care for their kids to go and be humans for awhile. We have kids but that's not the only thing going on in our lives."]}
