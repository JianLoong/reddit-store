We decided we should treat ourselves for once and go. \n\nI told my parents we going and they seemed to be happy for us at first. Then out of nowhere today they called me. Apparently my mother has been upset for days that we\u2019d even consider leaving the kids and travelling so far away. They said they weren\u2019t up to minding them at all. I said we were never going to ask them that, we had other relatives lined up. They said even so, they\u2019d still feel totally responsible for them while we\u2019re gone and if anything happened to them we\u2019d be too far away.

That is for only a days of absence. If your creche had a process like this, you can ask the trained personnel there about a week absence and what they recommend. \n\nyour risk is that your kids have a major meltdown, either with crying or with withdrawing. You are not there to help then. Your children should not have to suffer through that.\n\nI\u2018d recommend that you start training to leave your kids for a weekend, so that you can have a time out close by, in case it doesn\u2018t work with the kids over night somewhere else, and that you do the trip of a lifetime a bit later in your lifetime,when it\u2018s not a psychological risk to your kids.", "Look.

Once we were in middle school, we\u2019d stay alone (! - this was the 70\u2019s, we had close neighbors and were mature, good, responsible kids, though personally I wouldn\u2019t have left my kids alone at that age).  As teens, it was Fantastic! About the time we\u2019d all be getting on each others nerves, they\u2019d go away for a few days.  We had people to call (family, neighbors) in an emergency nearby.

If it upsets your kids to call, don\u2019t talk to them and only talk to their caregiver.  When older. Give them a calendar to mark off days until you return if that helps them understand when you will return.

You are the parents who makes the decisions for your children. Not other family members.  They are not always going to agree with your choices.  That\u2019s ok.

Despite the fact that I had been away from them before for trips within the same country, and that they knew exactly where I was and why I went alone and they were not distressed it was still a weird feeling having them on the other side of the world from me.

She is determined to visit there again sometime.", "I practically grew up on planes until I was about 5 (dad worked for an international company) and I still remember and appreciate all the experiences it gave me. \n\nSure, I can\u2019t remember specific things but I remember music, lights, food, colours, feelings, etc. I like to think it definitely helped enrichment as a person. \n\nThat being said, we travelled around the Oceania and Asia areas, so our shortest flights would\u2019ve only been about 1.5 hours and longest flight time would\u2019ve only been about maybe 8 hours.\n\nMy personality may also just suited me very well to being on long flights (parents told me they\u2019d give me the in flight entertainment and I\u2019d be pleased for the whole flight, or maybe a colouring or puzzle book). Not all kids are gonna be like this and I\u2019ve definitely been on flights with some brats. \n\nTravel is also not strictly necessary for enriching your child anyway, and I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend a trip half way around the globe with two kids under 10.", "I mean, I could see it if the cousins had consistent issues with getting along and getting in fights, but based on the info we have that doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s the case? It sounds like they get along really well and the SIL is happy to take them", "I just got back from a week away from my kids. I had a great week, they had a great week being spoiled by my parents..grandparents had quality time with them they normally don\u2019t get in the day to day. Not exactly the dramatic situation this lady is creating. NTA", "Oh there\u2019s absolutely people that believe taking any time for yourself at all as a parent is selfish, which is ridiculous. Obviously your priority is now your children, but as an adult (and a couple) you still need time to yourself", "Maybe it's a mix of worrying about you. Worrying about the kids being with someone other than her or you...also, and I'm truly just guessing, maybe she feels some type of way about you not first asking her if she would watch the kids. Cause she's the one that brought up anything that had to do with her being responsible for them. Yeah she was saying that she can't do it, but you didn't ask her to so there was no reason to bring it up. So maybe, she expected to be asked, she wasn't, that upset her and then all these other worries piled on. Idk, again, just guessing.", "Go. Have fun. I just did it and you know what? My flights were cancelled out of London on the way home for 3 days and my kids were still fine and happy that their parents had an amazing anniversary. Go!", "Yeah, given your kids get along with their cousins, and SIL would be happy to have them, I think your mom is casting about for a reason why your trip will affect her, and she's coming up dry.  Unless your SIL has a tendency to be flaky, that seems like an ideal place for them.", "Is it because I've used logic maybe??? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Well, at the very least, that\u2019s how they feel. With the parents out of the country they feel their Grandkids are their responsibility. I can understand this feeling, even if it\u2019s not technically correct.", "My parents went on a week long trip by themselves when my brother and I were about 15 and 14.  They left us with a fridge full of healthy meal options and instructions on how to prepare them, along with a decent amount of emergency money NOT TO BE USED.  They came home to a fridge full of healthy meals and every dollar of the emergency fund spent on pizza for us and all our friends haha.  We had a great time by ourselves!", "Yeah. OP and her husband need a break and deserve it, but traveling a bunch as a kid meant I was good at traveling. It was mostly long car trips but still. \n\nI would not do the once-in-a-lifetime trip with kids younger than 7 and anything prohibitively expensive with a kid who won\u2019t remember that (and the definition of that is going to change with each family), but the secret to a good trip at 8-10 is smaller trips at 2 or 3.", "My parents joke that I practically spent the first 5 years of my life on planes (dad worked for an international company, so we travelled a lot until I was old enough to start school). I\u2019ve been to majority of countries/states all over the Oceania and Asia area. \n\nI still remember a lot about the places and countries we visited and we have photos of course too. \n\nThat being said, I was a pretty well behaved kid and apparently a \u201cmodel\u201d flyer, even as a toddler. Give me the in flight entertainment, and I was settled for the whole flight. But a lot of that chalked up to my personality, not all kids are gonna be like that.\n\nIf OP and her husband want to enrich their kids, they can arrange some other time to take their kids somewhere; try somewhere closer first, and see how they go. Travel is not always necessary for cultural enrichment either, it just makes it easier. Introducing them to other cultures in other ways works too, like documentaries, food, languages, music, etc.\n\nDefinitely wouldn\u2019t have their first trip be across the globe.", "It's scary how many young moms these days won't allow their children to do sleepovers at all or just with relatives. Maybe that's been a thing already when I was little and nobody got to share it online back then but holy shit. Your children have to make new experiences and navigate all kinds of situations for them to grow into independent and self reliant adults. OP has a very healthy attitude towards parenting and is NTA.", "Lack of pizza as a teen is an emergency! So all that money was used as intended.", "> but the secret to a good trip at 8-10 is smaller trips at 2 or 3.\n\nAgree wholeheartedly with this. My four year old goes through airport security with more ease than most adults in the US. I was the same way. I took my first flight to a different country alone at ten and was perfectly at ease doing it. \nI\u2019m extremely confident when traveling and can pretty much figure out any new city and pick up a few words of the language straight away. \nTraveling is so beneficial even for young children, at the age where their brain is still growing and developing at an impressive speed. \nHaving said that I see this attitude in the US a lot, children only participate in things that are specifically child oriented. Many people are shocked that when we visit my home country my children are out until late at night, going out for drinks with my friends or to parties and restaurants. For us it is the norm and I think it contributes to children knowing how to handle themselves in social situations so much better.", "I think OP and her husband are not being travellers in general, so it makes sense that their kids have not been exposed to foreign countries, my comment was more in reference to the person saying that the kids are too young for unnecessary travel. \nI disagree because I don\u2019t think traveling is unnecessary, especially for young kids.", "Oh wow.  My dad trained us not to raise our voices very young.  Mom told us we could tell her anything - if we had a problem with her, let her know.  Then she got all hurt if we did. I couldn't tell her anything and learned real young not to argue, ever.  It's taken years of therapy to get over that.", "It totally is. Took me many years to see through it all but a least now I know all of those manipulation tactics and won't give into them anymore as easily. Let the mom pout, she'll get over it."]}
