End of discussion.", "Happens to me too. Honestly terrible gifts.\nThe only way there's harm is if you get a name and don't buy a gift. As long as you don't draw a name or take a gift, I don't see how you would cause any problems.", "NTA the thought does count and the gifts you've gotten suck because they were thoughtless and impersonal- not because they were cheap.", "NTA \n\nParticipation is optional and you are not getting any happiness from it so there's no reason for you to participate.", "NTA.  Ugh, people who under-deliver on gift exchanges ruin the experience for whoever gets their gift.  But it also sucks to feel like you HAVE to participate at work even though an extra $30 might not be in your holiday budget.  \n\nBut I think what your boss said about it being \u201cthe thought that counts\u201d is the take-home point.  You\u2019ve received gifts with little thought, while putting a lot of thought into the gifts you\u2019ve given.  Even if it\u2019s not about the money, you\u2019re getting less than you\u2019re giving, which would be disappointing for most people.", "NTA for your choice or reasoning. The thing is your boss asked if you wanted to join\u2014 it\u2019s not company policy. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about looking bad for not joining, I\u2019d join and just get the same type of gifts that others are getting for you. Fair is fair. Nobody can be mad about you spending less than the budget when everyone else is doing the same thing. \n\nOr the workplace could decide to lower the budget so it\u2019s not as big of an issue and stick to giving cheap wines and make up as gifts if that\u2019s the minimal thought that others want to put into the gifts as well. \n\nHope you find a solution that works for you!", "NTA it wad not the best question to answer honestly.  When it comes to work diplomacy trumps honesty sometimes", "NTA Tell him it *is* the thought that counts and what you have received so far shows no thought. It's no fun for you as you feel like an idiot for seemingly being the only one participating in the spirit of the event. The problem is that there is a mismatch of interest and energy. If people don't have the time, money, or interest to sincerely participate in the exchange that's fine, but you wouldn't feel good grabbing something easy and cheap off the shelf just to  go through the motions, so the peaceful solution is to drop out.\n\nETA: I chose to offer advice on clarifying your honest answer rather than being diplomatic and finding an insincere yet acceptable excuse for not participating because you have already been bluntly honest so that horse has already left the barn. If you think that your boss would take further honesty badly then perhaps you might want to find another way of handling things and disengage yourself from the process emotionally, just viewing the situation as office politics to be navigated.", "NTA but also not professionally smart. Buy a nice bottle of wine and work the event for professional purposes. Keep the demand for specific gifts for your personal life,", "NTA for choosing not to participate;  that\u2019s completely your prerogative.  \n\nI will say, though, that I\u2019ve always personally viewed/expected gift exchanges (Yankee swaps/white elephant, secret Santa, etc.) to be more of a silly festive social activity rather than a serious gift giving one.  I\u2019ve always tried to give good gifts bc I love finding gifts, but I\u2019ve also grown up participating in many that were a mixed bag ranging from gag gifts to nice electronics (extra interesting for a Yankee swap/white elephant!).  So, I\u2019ve learned to just roll with it and have fun/try to enjoy the social aspect of it.  Also, there are definitely people out there who are just horrible gift givers, no matter how hard they try (I currently work somewhere where there is someone like that - legend is, he gifted a can of car engine oil one year \ud83d\udc80. Everyone gave him such a hard time for it that he gets super stressed out about participating now).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It seems like a waste of time and energy as well as money.", "NAH. \nBut you do have entirely the wrong attitude towards this. Work gift exchanges are just meant to be a bit of fun, and really you are much to focused on what you receive. No one gets good gifts at work gift exchanges.  You are not an arsehole, but you are the kind of person that takes fun activities way too setiously, and focuses more on what you get out of it personally rather then the other aspects, like giving to others, and sharing enjoyment and experiences. People like you suck the fun out of things. \n\nYou have no obligation to participate. But it does make you a bit of a scrooge.", "NTA for how you acted in this particular circumstance, but I get the sense that I'd think you were an asshole if I ever met you", "NTA.  there should be a minimum of $25 and no max.  people are either cheap  and/or couldn\u2019t be bothered to get a thoughtful gift.  some people are pressed for time or money or both at the holidays as well\n\nwhy would he ask if you wanted to participate, if you weren\u2019t allowed to say no.  i get his point, but have also been in your position, which is annoying and disheartening \n\nif you don\u2019t participate tho, it\u2019s going to be noticed and you could become the office grinch.  \n\ni guess it depends which makes you feel worse", "NTA for not wanting to participate. However, you committed a little bit of career suicide by telling your boss why you wanted to opt out.\n\nEdit\u2026.changing my answer based on OP answer.", "Sorry if my grammar is bad I\u2019m on mobile and it keep freezing", "Huh! Reminds me of a gift giving a few years back\u2026 a good friend is into knitting and crocheting. She spent hours on a crocheted cloak/mantle as her gift, I thought it was gorgeous. The recipient was completely ungrateful to the point that the gift was abandoned in a corner. My friend was hurt, I was angry on her behalf; so I gave the recipient the crap, thoughtless, gift someone else had given me and happily took home the crocheted article. Oddly enough, the ungrateful person loved the thing I had been given and wasn\u2019t excited about. My friend crocheted a matching hat for me in the next six months. Somehow all of us ended up happy.", "NTA", "NTA,. I have been fortunate to have avoided this most of my life.  It tends to be less common in male dominated fields.", "NTA\n\nit is indeed the thought that counts but you are always welcome to opt out. plus, those gifts u received sounds low effort, or no effort", "You wouldn't be an AH by not participating- honestly the lack of effort or interest is a waste of money, you're not going to enjoy those items, so why participate? It's not obligatory, perhaps your boss doesn't truly realize the garbage being disguised by festive wrapping. \n\nI participated in a secret Santa at work. Worked hard to surprise my person, I never received anything- they suggested gifting small things with a \"big present\" on the last day. Then I overheard the CEO (open floor plan) tell her assistant to regift something sent to her by a rep. No shame, the assistant walked 2 cubicles over and handed me a cheap tumbler with a $5 Starbucks gift card inside... With the CEOs name on it. The tumbler cracked when i took the lid off. She planned the secret Santa.", "NTA. Good for you opting out. I also opt out of anything shopping-related at Christmas. Stressful enough without gift considerations. \n\nSpend your money on you and your loved ones.", "NTA. You don\u2019t want to do it, so you don\u2019t have to. Your reason actually doesn\u2019t matter.", "NTA.", "Can\u2019t you elect to adopt a family or something instead? I\u2019d rather do that than give to a random coworker", "I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s allowed to comment on what you *should* do in a completely optional, not part of the paid work, situation. He can ask if you\u2019re taking part, he can\u2019t criticise your decision not to.\n\nSome people are terrible at these things. You may have got unlucky. However, if you don\u2019t want to run the risk of being disappointed agin, that\u2019s fair and fine. NTA", "Oh NTA. Same here. I always put thought into it and always for garbage. So opted out many years ago.", "Precisely, it's the thought that counts and none of them think NTA", "NAH but OP it's good office politics to take part in these things, even if you think they're stupid or you get bad gifts.", "Me thinks it's probably Boss himself ...", "You\u2019re right I\u2019m probably gonna end up changing my mind last minute since I don\u2019t want to look bad \ud83d\ude05who knows maybe this year will be different", "I never spent more than I was supposed to though? I always kept it at 30$ but I always made sure to get my person something they wanted.", "yes. Here\u2019s hoping you get a gift from someone who is as conscientious as yourself. Happy freaking holiday!!!\ud83d\ude0a", "I think there are two different things going on at once. There's the gift exchange as a sincere event, and there is the gift exchange as a bit of office politics to be cynically navigated. \n\nHow to proceed will partially depend on whether your boss is open to honesty or will view non-participation badly no matter what. \n\nI kind of suspect that your boss wants the gift exchange to be sincere, but hasn't thought things through and sees it as successful if people simply participate. \n\nIf this is true you would be in a bit of a difficult position as not participating might make you look like someone who is self-interested and not a team player, even though the reality is that you don't want to participate in a non-sincere event where everyone is doing the minimum to go through the motions. I also suspect that most of your coworkers just see this as an annoying bit of office politics they have to be seen to be participating in, just to please the boss."]}
