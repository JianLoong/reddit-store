You\u2019ve received gifts with little thought, while putting a lot of thought into the gifts you\u2019ve given.

If people don't have the time, money, or interest to sincerely participate in the exchange that's fine, but you wouldn't feel good grabbing something easy and cheap off the shelf just to  go through the motions, so the peaceful solution is to drop out.\n\nETA: I chose to offer advice on clarifying your honest answer rather than being diplomatic and finding an insincere yet acceptable excuse for not participating because you have already been bluntly honest so that horse has already left the barn.

I\u2019ve always tried to give good gifts bc I love finding gifts, but I\u2019ve also grown up participating in many that were a mixed bag ranging from gag gifts to nice electronics (extra interesting for a Yankee swap/white elephant!).  So, I\u2019ve learned to just roll with it and have fun/try to enjoy the social aspect of it.  Also, there are definitely people out there who are just horrible gift givers, no matter how hard they try (I currently work somewhere where there is someone like that - legend is, he gifted a can of car engine oil one year \ud83d\udc80.

Work gift exchanges are just meant to be a bit of fun, and really you are much to focused on what you receive. No one gets good gifts at work gift exchanges.  You are not an arsehole, but you are the kind of person that takes fun activities way too setiously, and focuses more on what you get out of it personally rather then the other aspects, like giving to others, and sharing enjoyment and experiences.

Reminds me of a gift giving a few years back\u2026 a good friend is into knitting and crocheting. She spent hours on a crocheted cloak/mantle as her gift, I thought it was gorgeous. The recipient was completely ungrateful to the point that the gift was abandoned in a corner. My friend was hurt, I was angry on her behalf; so I gave the recipient the crap, thoughtless, gift someone else had given me and happily took home the crocheted article.

It's not obligatory, perhaps your boss doesn't truly realize the garbage being disguised by festive wrapping. \n\nI participated in a secret Santa at work. Worked hard to surprise my person, I never received anything- they suggested gifting small things with a \"big present\" on the last day. Then I overheard the CEO (open floor plan) tell her assistant to regift something sent to her by a rep. No shame, the assistant walked 2 cubicles over and handed me a cheap tumbler with a $5 Starbucks gift card inside... With the CEOs name on it. The tumbler cracked when i took the lid off.
