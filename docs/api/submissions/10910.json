In fact there are some dishes I don't even eat anymore because I don't want to risk spilling the secret.\n\nMy sister has my four year old nephew with her husband. When she had him our mother gave her a list of all the old family recipes for her to cook. They don't plan on having another child, so this would have to be returned to the family when she dies. \n\nAnyway I was coming over for a visit, and she told me she was making dinner. When I got there I was shocked that she was not only cooking with her husband, but reading off the family recipes in front of him and my nephew. I panicked and started screaming at her that she was going against our culture, and left.\n\nI called our mother, who called her to ask if it was true. When she confirm that yes, her husband had free access to the recipes, my mother disowned her, and had the rest of the family follow suit. I did the same, I have no interest in ever seeing her or her son ever again after what she did to the family. My wife told me that it wasn't a big deal, and that some of the recipes might have been lost forever otherwise, But she doesn't understand my families culture.", "created_utc": 1677370603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11c08iw/aita_for_telling_my_mother_my_sister_was_sharing/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But, to yell and leave is the height of immaturity.  So, YTA for that alone - not even getting into your viewpoints, just how you reacted.\n\nBut also, you took it further. Instead of having an open and honest discussion with her about it, you decided to go to Mom. You probably knew what this would elicit as far as reactions go, and yet you did it anyway.

They don't plan on having another child, so this would have to be returned to the family when she dies. \n\nAnyway I was coming over for a visit, and she told me she was making dinner. When I got there I was shocked that she was not only cooking with her husband, but reading off the family recipes in front of him and my nephew. I panicked and started screaming at her that she was going against our culture, and left.\n\nI called our mother, who called her to ask if it was true. When she confirm that yes, her husband had free access to the recipes, my mother disowned her, and had the rest of the family follow suit. I did the same, I have no interest in ever seeing her or her son ever again after what she did to the family. My wife told me that it wasn't a big deal, and that some of the recipes might have been lost forever otherwise, But she doesn't understand my families culture.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
