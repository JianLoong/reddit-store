We invited his sisters and their families to join us. His older sister accepted and booked a cabin for her family. He told me he wanted to ask his younger sister (F 29) if she wanted to stay with us at the cabin we booked since it holds more people than we have. Every time we go for a vacation we tell the younger sister we will pay for lodging if she helps with a portion of the groceries since she and her daughter will be eating and staying with us. It has become a pattern that she only brings certain foods that she and her daughter will eat (snacks that are only for her and her daughter) and we end up having to provide the major meals for everybody. This wouldn\u2019t bother me as much, but his sister won\u2019t help clean up, do dishes, or anything to keep our lodging clean. I end up doing everything including cooking, cleaning and even their laundry. I already do most of this for my family (with my husbands help), but this feels like she\u2019s completely taking advantage. This has been brought up in the past but she says she and her daughter are only 2 people so she shouldn\u2019t be responsible for food and cleaning since we are a family of 5 and we eat most of the food and make most of the mess. Once again I don\u2019t mind cleaning up and cooking, but she won\u2019t offer to do anything to help even though we paid about  $2000 for the vacation and she paid maybe $200 including her \u201csnacks\u201d that she won\u2019t even let my kids eat.

Did you ever see the original \"The Parent Trap\" movie? The part where the mom \"suddenly\" changes her mind about going camping and tricks her ex-husband's new fianc\u00e9e into going? \n\nAt the last minute, send your husband with the kids and his sister. HE can deal with her, doing all the cleaning, cooking and doing her laundry. Let him find out for himself while you treat yourself to some peace and quiet, maybe enjoying a spa day and a night out with your girlfriends! Lol", "NTA, maybe this time you can sit out of cleaning up and cooking. Buy stuff only for your kids and enjoy your vacation. Let hubby take care of everything since he thinks you\u2019re unreasonable.", "NTA! \nIf your husband insist on inviting her, then only cook for you and Your kids. Leave her mess, her laundry, and her took cook her herself, her daughter and your husband. \nCharger her for the groceries, and tell her that ALL snacks that are brought into to the cabin are for EVERYBODY. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019ve put up with it without doing anything, you\u2019ve basically been her maid on your vacation.", "**NTA**\n\n**DO NOT GO**.   He wants to avoid the conversation, you can avoid the situation: just let your husband go on vacation with his sisters.   If he wants to take your kids, let him.   Tell your husband you have no wish to be his sister's maid yet again and he can take on all the work of being majordomo.   If he doesn't, you and the kids can enjoy a \"staycation\" where you do lots of things on your own schedule.  Or you can book yourself for a 3-4 day spa on your own. \n\nI'm serious here.   He doesn't respect your position and thinks he can just override your legitimate concerns.   The two of you belong in couples counseling.  And the first step might be for him to read this post.", "NTA.  It's your vacation too.  Hubby can do the cooking, clean up and laundry and understand the issue.", "Your husband knows how you feel and still invited her without speaking to you first? That's just wrong. You two are supposed to be a united front. NTA, and it's time for a serious talk with your hubby.", "NTA except maybe to yourself. If your boundary is that she not stay with y\u2019all, you need to tell your husband that. I think you need to figure out your needs in order to vacation with this person. You need your husband to meet you in the middle.", "NTA - how is it a vacation if you\u2019re stuck cooking and cleaning for extra people? Your husband and SIL are TAs in this situation. I say either boycott cooking and cleaning, etc. if your husband insists on his sister joining or you stand firm and say no to her staying with you. \n\nBut I think the first option could have a more desirable outcome going forward. If your husband realizes all the extra work that comes with his sister, he\u2019ll definitely be less inclined to invite her to stay with your family next time.", "NTA.  Your husband invited them and didn't even want to tell you so let him do everything for them. If it were me, I would stay home and enjoy some real downtime and let him take care of absolutely everything. \n\nDefinitely stop doing their laundry. Let your husband clean their bathroom. He should also be doing half the cooking for your family plus the additional work his sister creates. If you are there 7 days,  then you should only be coming 2.5 days (half of 5), and your husband gets to take care of the other 4.5 days.", "NTA. It's a vacation, and why do you deserve less of one than your husband or his sister? Sounds like his priorities are mixed up. I'd look to find a way for her to help - she commits to 1/3 of the meals, or does all after meal cleaning or all laundry. If she refuses, then she makes their own meals completely separate. No one should get an easy vacation at the expense of someone else!", "NTA why wouldn't she just get her own place like the other sister? She clearly has no intention of chipping in with the work or cost so why should you bankroll her vacation? In fact it's quite rude that you would do that for her and not the other sister!", "NTA\n\nInviting her sounds like it makes it not a holiday for you. You end up just having to do the things you\u2019d do at home for your family, plus two, in a strange place. That sounds exhausting. \n\nMaybe you could tell your husband he can go with the kids and his sister, and you stay at home and actually enjoy a break. See how he feels about his sisters lack of contribution when he\u2019s the one cleaning up and cooking after her and her daughter.", "NTA but if your husband insists on inviting her to stay with you I'd make it a condition that he picks up any extra slack from her.", "NTA.  if you end up cleaning after everyone, it's not a vacation for you.  Can you bring your husband on board with doing more/some cleaning?  If you don't think that will work, a more drastic option is can you stay home and let your husband deal with our children and his sister/niece?", "NTA but your husband should have your back on this.", "NTA - I second bowing out of the vacation. Knowing what\u2019s already going to happen and that your husband is party to it, I don\u2019t know how it doesn\u2019t take out all the excitement and desire of going. \nAt this point if you go, don\u2019t lift a finger and enjoy your vacation and have a serious talk with your husband about this. Are you never going to get to fully enjoy a family vacation again?", "He invited her without discussing it with you. You should uninvite yourself at the last minute so he can feel the full brunt of the load you would be shouldering. I bet he won't do it again. Since he wants to avoid a conversation with you about it I think it's fine for you to avoid the whole situation by not going.", "NTA - and don't do anything for sis - don't make her meals, don't wash her dishes, don't do her laundry (no idea why you ever did that)\n\nHubby can figure it out while you ENJOY yourself.", "Vacations are supposed to provide some relaxation.  In order to do this for your family, younger sis needs to rent her own cabin.  NTA.", ">he didn\u2019t want to tell me he invited her to avoid this conversation\n\nThereby making himself an instant AH. Don't sneak behind your partner's back. \n\n>the cabin we booked since it holds more people than we have\n\nWas this intentional? Is he planning to have space to ask her to stay with you? Maybe change the accommodations next year to somewhere where each family grouping has their own place? That way you could join up for meals or not, depending on your moods. It would also give you a place to retreat to and leave her to deal with her own mess.\n\nDon't do their laundry. Don't leave your snacks where they can access them if they won't share theirs. Perhaps talk with the other adults and set up a plan for each to take turns providing dinner rather than having everyone look to you to provide it. \n\nMaybe next year you can all go on a cruise. They can pay for their own cabin, select their own meal plan and excursion options, and you can all have a relaxing time.", "NTA\n\nSet up a chore schedule and who is responsible for what and on which day. My biggest pet peeve is going on \"vacations\" like these and there's more to do than at home!!! Make sure everybody knows their role and agrees.\n\nSet up a spreadsheet of food that needs to be bought and put her name on some of that. If she doesn't want to spend the effort buying it tell her you'll buy it and to send you the money. \n\nDuring vacation, on your off days you do absolutely nothing. Stick to it. If his sister doesn't hold up to the chore chart then somebody else will need to pick up her slack and it isn't gonna be you.", "You\u2019re NTA, because with her joining you, it won\u2019t be a vacation, it will be work.", "NTA.\n\nBut your hubby kind of is for not supporting you.  Everyone deserved a rest / vacation on occasion.\n\nYou should stand up for yourself. It\u2019s not a vacation when she is there. But there may be other solutions if hubby insists on inviting her, pick all that apply:\n- you don\u2019t go, and enjoy some quiet time where you aren\u2019t the slave\n- SIL splits the cost of lodging and food rather than\u201dcontributing\u201d food or whatever \n- SIL pay a set amount in advance towards food rather than her \u201c bringing\u201d stuff\n- Set ground rules in advance, maybe SIL will cook and clean X days of the vacation or she can\u2019t stay with you and make it really clear with hubby and SIL that this is her last chance\n- SIL pay for a cleaning service to come several times during your stay\n- Hubby agrees you get a mom day where you sleep in, go do whatever you want, and don\u2019t cook or clean at all\n- stay somewhere else that conveniently doesn\u2019t accommodate her", "NTA.
