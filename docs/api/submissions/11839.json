It would also give you a place to retreat to and leave her to deal with her own mess.\n\nDon't do their laundry. Don't leave your snacks where they can access them if they won't share theirs. Perhaps talk with the other adults and set up a plan for each to take turns providing dinner rather than having everyone look to you to provide it. \n\nMaybe next year you can all go on a cruise.

This time be sure that you put your feet up.  Your husbands help isn't the lions share and you're doing the most of the heavy lifting in this arrangement.  If children are hungry - tell them that their father is cooking the meal,  if they need clean clothes ' their father has to do laundry'.  You make a practice of getting up and leaving the children to their father , taking a book to a pool or whatever place of rest is nearby.  Its a proven fact that women don't carve out enough free time for themselves.\n\nIts tough for her being a single parent but you shouldn't be doing her laundry.  For your husband to see how you feel, let him do her laundry etc.", "NTA make her get her own accommodation.", "NTA but I have a question--why are you doing ALL the cleaning and cooking etc. while your husband does nothing? Does he have a condition that prevents him from doing any kind of housework?", "YTA\nYou have a husband problem. You need to sit him down and have a serious discussion about his sister treating you like crap. You also needed to confront his sister and tell her to grow up, pay up, and shut up.\nIt\u2019s your choice to live this way. Give them an ultimatum or stop complaining about it.", "NTA\n\nYour husband creates a problem and makes you deal with the fallout, pretty shitty of him. \n\nWhy are you the default care taker on vacation??? Even if you are a SAHM, this is your vacation, too. ALL work/ care taking for your family unit should be split 50/50 between you and your husband. What does your husband contribute? Does he take on half of the mental load as well as executing half of the work?\n\nYour SIL argues how she and her daughter need less food and create less work than your group of 5. I'd be petty: Make her pay 2/7 of everything: Cabin, food, activities. Doesn't matter if you'd have extra anyways, you could invite friends who'd happily pay AND be better companiond in terms of work load instead of her and her kid...or enjoy the extra space, less work, less considering the needs and wants of other people. \n\nAgain: Your husband is creating a problem by essentially avoiding the conflict/ conversation and expects you to just deal with it. Refuse. His sister, his avoidance, his problem. I wouldn't even negotiate the 2/7 money split and if he doesn't address the work split, it's on him. Just drop the complete responsibility on him. Tell him beforehand, he needs to clariy conditions with his sister or its on him to deal with consequences. \n\nNot your circus, not your monkeys.\n\nAlternative: Exclude SIL from benefitting from your work. Don't cook for her, don't let her eat your snacks, don't clean up after her, be petty about it. Don't feel bad, she is doing the same and is rude while being petty.", "NTA.  So don't do any cooking or cleaning.  If your husband wants her there then he can do the cooking and cleaning.  you are a family member not a maid.   Also don't cook meals for her and her daughter.  They can get their own.", "Tell your husband to clean up after all of you. End of story.", "NTA- why do you have to pay for the vacation for her part?

I bet even most groceries won\u2019t be that much of a problem now", "NTA but literally do nothing for the sister and make your husband do it. \"Hubby, there's a pile of SIL's clothes in the washer.

Tell your husband, she can come if you eat out every day and get a cleaning service in.", "NTA But IMO this isn\u2019t a vacation for you. You do all the cooking, cleaning and watching the kids. How is this any different than being home except for location? Anyway, you do you. But you\u2019re not wrong.", "NTA but he should be the one doing most of the cleaning and cooking. Then he'll understand how much extra work they're both dumping on you, her for refusing to clean and him for bringing her along in the first place.", "NTA\n\n>My husband is annoyed that I brought this up and told me he didn\u2019t want to tell me he invited her to avoid this conversation.\n\nPerhaps he should volunteer to take up all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry if he wants her there so badly. \n\nI mean, really. You probably do all that at home anyway. How the hell is it a vacation to go somewhere else and do all that same stuff you do at home, for 2 extra people? \n\nI'd be tempted to \"get sick\" the night before but encourage hubby to go along with the kids anyways so they don't miss \"their vacation\".", "NTA\nBut it sounds like you aren't too smart either. Why are you doing their laundry? You SIL has a slave for a week, everything gets done and she doesn't have go pay, why would she. When do you go ob your vacation? Because you definitely aren't on vacation if you are cleaning up after more people than usual. You might want to take a good look at the people in your life and how they are treating you because this sounds like you are expected to do as much and more than you do at home and pay for it as well. Nonsense.", "NTA. OP, in dealing with the kind of people like your sister-in-law, you have to realize - they are not going to change being AHs and it seems that your husband is not willing to rock the boat on this one for you either. \n\nSo put your own sanity first.  Do not wash the dishes (srsly, you are on a vacation...). Do something about the laundry (either take enough clothes with you to last the vacation so there's no need to do it at all or do only your immediate family's). When buying snacks, buy only for your children.\n\nAlso, be upfront and calmly explain all of this to your husband and make him understand, that letting his sister know this is on him.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I LOVE IT", "u/Maximum-Sky2510 *'I love this! I wouldn\u2019t do that bc I\u2019m so excited to go on our vacation'*\n\nIt might be worth the sacrifice.

How is that a vacation? It sounds like you're just changing the location of where you're doing chores.\n\nThat being said NTA but don't do all the cooking and cleaning. And just cook for your family. Only pick up after your family.", "And your husband knows this and can treat you as he likes. How convenient for him....", "You know he won\u2019t. Why complain when you aren\u2019t doing anything to sort your husband out?", "It sounds like he gets a great holiday whether his sister is there or not. Slave, aka you, cooks and cleans for everyone. If this ah sister is up to her usual antics, just cook for you and your own children and clean your own mess. Leave her and your doormat husband to see to themselves.", "Yeah, go somewhere else. \n\nWhy are you doing her laundry?", "What about a rota? Sister, husband and you rotate each day who takes care of the cooking. Each of you takes care of a third of the workload.", "I honestly get that, as a kid we used to do big family trips often and I understand being that family oriented, but part of family oriented is that you look out for family too. \n\nIf you're taking care of everything it's not a vacation for you too.\n\n So if you tried talking about it and he's not receptive, I would just do what I can. So for example if you handled cleaning dinner is on someone else that way you enjoy the evening, or even talk with your kids (that are old enough) to make sure that they know \"even though we're on vacation everyone has to clean up after themselves\" so any mess created by not your family is simply not your problem. Simply do what you're capable of and don't push yourself, so that way you enjoy your time as well :)\n\nEdit for judgement: obviously NTA", "So are you going to let him take over the cooking and cleaning this time?", "In that case I recommend setting clear boundaries, such as \"I will be bringing portable locks and locking away 3/4 of the dishes as we are 3/4 of the people. Same goes with food we purchase. I will cook sufficient portions for our family of five and clean those dishes. I will not touch the ones designated to your sister and her daughter. I accept that you want to help her and I accept that she doesn't want to be responsible for anything relating to our family, therefore I will not be responsible for anything relating to hers. If either of you claim this is unwelcoming, I will not be agreeing to any more large family vacations. I have compromised unhappily for years and have reached my limit.\"", "It seems you *always* hash it out after.
