It would also give you a place to retreat to and leave her to deal with her own mess.\n\nDon't do their laundry. Don't leave your snacks where they can access them if they won't share theirs. Perhaps talk with the other adults and set up a plan for each to take turns providing dinner rather than having everyone look to you to provide it. \n\nMaybe next year you can all go on a cruise.

I would request that she contribute to the cost of the trip - $500 or whatever you think is right - so that you are less resentful. And definitely do NOT do her or her daughter's laundry. She can do that.", "NTA, but time to stop the insanity and let your husband be the carer for this vacation and time for you to frolic in the woods (or whatever he is doing while you work).  He needs to experience the unpleasantness of his sister to understand your point of view.  Just let him know this is your vacation this time and he and the kids/SIL will be doing the heavy lifting this time.", "Don\u2019t do anything for her. Let her stay.

I\u2019d recommend getting two smaller cabins, asking her how much she can afford, and maybe your husband making up the rest considering he wants her to be included, but understands she cannot afford to vacation on her own. \n\nShe can be responsible for all the food, and the cleaning of her own cabin. \n\nTell your husband you\u2019ve tried to make it work but this is notification for you, but actually much more work, and you don\u2019t wanna do it anymore. Do you want to enjoy your vacation.", "NTA\n\nThis really sucks, but one thing you should definitely stop doing is her laundry. She is 29 years old and is a mother. She can do her and her daughters own laundry. This is also suppose to be a vacation for YOU too, especially if you and your husband are paying for it. If she says anything about you not doing a grown women\u2019s laundry while you\u2019re trying to relax, on a vacation you paid for, she\u2019ll just make herself look like an ass in front of the family", "Brilliant!", "I agree. It sounds like you are enabling her too. Just don\u2019t do it. Take care of your kids. Clean up after your kids. If you. Get charged extra at the end because she didn\u2019t clean her stuff.

You could do the same thing to her that she does to you.  She doesn't like eggs? We're having eggs for breakfast every day from now on!  \n\nAlso, tell her that she gets to do the cooking 1/3 of the time.  She can at least do her share... and if she doesn't, then you can stop cooking for her and her daughter (you could go further and not allow them to eat anything you've made.)\n\nShe's being a leech... taking advantage of you and your husband.

Only cook enough for your family. Only wash your family's dishes. Just refuse to clean any of her mess.

You're not her maid.", "please update lol", "Then go on the trip and tell him he is in charge of the family he doesn\u2019t want to exclude.

Stop letting them use you. Speak up to the sister directly even if it makes your selfish SIL and husband mad. Say loudly to her \u201cI am not your maid, cook, or cruise director. Do it yourself!\u201d\n\nAs for your husband, when he inevitably gets mad, calmly say \u201cthey are YOUR guests. You invited them without even talking to me about it.

Leave their laundry on the side.\n\nMake food that's only for you and your kids; you can pack and label it. Be petty.\n\nAsk your husband to cook and clean for everyone.\n\nNext time, book lodging that's big enough only for your family of five.", "NTA, honestly I would just say no to letting her stay with you period. She can rent her own small cabin for her and her daughter and deal with her own cleaning and meals.", "Just split everything evenly, so if you\u2019re there for seven days she\u2019s responsible for two and you and your husband are responsible for five. She buys the food and cooks the meals for two of the days, she has to do the chores for two of the days, so run the dishwasher, do laundry or whatever needs to get done. Keep in mind that she doesn\u2019t have to do everything on the same two days. You can even be kind enough to let her pick her two days print out a calendar and write it on the calendar and add some of the chores to your husband. Make it clear that you\u2019re on vacation too and that they need to contribute. Have it completely laid out ahead time.", "NTA. If you HAVE to go, do nothing for her and her daughter, no laundry, no food preparation, nothing. If SIL or hubby get angry, just tell them you are looking after your family, and since SIL. didnt want to participate you thought she would be taking care of it herself.  Or better yet, have SIL stay in the other cabin and eliminate the pest entirely. I like what other commenters have said- have a last minute  conflict and don\u2019t go- let hubby deal with her crap and see if asking her to come is easier than taking care of everything for her.", "NTA\n\nTake the amount that you spend on groceries and divide it by 7.

Which your SIL is not doing.\n\nMy brother has 6 people to help with his dinner while there\u2019s only 2 of us for our dinner - but it is what it is? \n\nIt should also be a vacation for you and that\u2019s not the case if you are doing all the work and your SIL is getting a free vacation.\n\nIf she can\u2019t contribute financially, it\u2019s wild she won\u2019t contribute in other ways.", "NTA, let your husband do all cooking, cleaning, dish washing at this family vacation.  \nMaybe he will understood better.", "NTA but stop cooking for them and stop doing their laundry.", "NTA\n\nTime to make her pay.

Again, sorry, had no idea you'd be Interested, we will be back later....etc.   lol", "Oh no, she gets the EXACT same level of vacation that he does. As in, no cleaning, no cooking, nothing.
