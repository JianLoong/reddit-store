Perhaps talk with the other adults and set up a plan for each to take turns providing dinner rather than having everyone look to you to provide it. \n\nMaybe next year you can all go on a cruise.

It's either that or she stays with the other sister.", "NTA and I would try not to do anything for SIL. The least she could do is taking care of her own laundry and cleaning up after herself. It's not fair to you that you are forced to be everyones made the whole vacation.\nIf your husband does not see the problem he can clean up after his sister.", "NTA. Tell your husband to cook and clean if that's his attitude about it.", "The real question is why are you allowing your SIL to treat you as a doormat? You \"have\" to do the cooking and cleaning? Really? Why not take your children out and let your husband cook and clean up after his sister? If she doesn't contribute to the food in the house, then make food your your family and tell her you assumed she was going out to eat since she didn't bring her own. NTA for not wanting your SIL to go on vacation, but if you go and allow her to treat you like a maid, then that is on you.", "Yep, totally. This is an awesome plan.", "Brilliant!", "Agreed. Hoping on a top comment to say to OP: Tell him his sister needs to get her own lodging and food, or she needs to pay BEFORE the trip for 2/7 of the food and lodging. You budgeted it and the trip will cost $2,000? She needs to pay $572 (2000/7=286*2=$572). Also tell them you will not be doing laundry or cleaning the sister/her daughters room. Maybe even charge them a fee for chores before. $25 a day, $175 a week, if they pitch in, she gets it back, if they don\u2019t, you keep it.\n\nShe has proven she is unwilling to contribute, so charge her beforehand.", "Just tell your husband any thing his sister messes up he cleans and if you have to make a meal you will make it for everyone but his sister, if he wants her to eat he will have to make it for her. Don\u2019t lift a single finger to help his sister who is taking advantage of you.", "Can\u2019t you assign her parts of meals to bring and make?", "Doesn\u2019t sound like much of a vacation if you have to clean up and cook for extra people.", "Go on your own vacation somewhere else. Do something fun for you. Take a minute to relax. I hate when family pressures you into doing things for them and it just becomes expected that you'll clean up after their poor behavior- but the only way you'll get them to stop is to shake them up enough they realize they should be embarrassed of themselves.", "Go on the vacation but refuse to cook and clean for anyone but you and your kids. Your husband can take care of his sister since he invited her. NTA.", "Thanks! \ud83d\ude02", ":-)", ":-)", "No, no, no. Do not leave it up to him seeing anything. He already knows it\u2019s an issue and is not changing. Tell him outright. \u2018This is my holiday too, and I will not be designated maid servant any longer. I am delighted to see all your family, but I will not be catering to them as I have in the past. I am not their servant. I will be cooking for our family unit, and the extended family will need to cater for themselves. I will not be taking on the little jobs you have expected from me to make *your* holiday experience smooth, because it takes *my* holiday away from me.\u2019 \n\nIf you cannot have a conversation like this with your husband then you have larger issues that need dealing with. NTA but don\u2019t let yourself be the family doormat. Frankly, if I\u2019d let myself get in your situation I\u2019d find a reason to leave him at the cabin with his family and the kids and go take off somewhere on my own for a week. \u2018Oh, how terrible, I have an infectious disease that requires I quarantine myself in this beach hut elsewhere. So sad. See you all in a week.\u2019 \n\nYou are the agent of your own servitude if you don\u2019t take steps against it.", "Your kids see that only mom \u201cnotices\u201d the mess. What are their takeaways re: relationships and gender roles?", "Ugh, my MIL ran into this. For many years, she'd hold a family reunion each summer for her and her family and then her three brothers and their families. Of course, because she was \"the girl\" - she was the one expected to do all the planning, shopping, cooking and cleaning. She'd no sooner finish the breakfast dishes than people would start saying \"What's for lunch?\" My FIL, my husband and his brother would help, but the rest would just sit around like they were at a resort. Unbelievable.\n\nWell, after about 15 years of these reunions, MIL ran into some health issues and she had to cancel that summer's reunion because she had some major surgery and was unable to host. You'd think one of the other family members would host, but nope. They were like \"See ya next summer.\" Well, next summer came and MIL realized she just didn't have it in her to do these anymore (she was well into her 60's at the time and it was just too much). So she reached out to her brothers to see if they, or one of their adult children, would be willing to host. She said she'd help with the cooking, but couldn't commit to hosting 25-30 people for a long weekend. \n\nThey were all like \"Nope, it's just too much.\" She was like, \"Yeah, it is a lot which is why, after 15 years, I'm not doing it anymore.\" \n\nWell, the family reunions just stopped at that point because no one was willing to pick up where MIL left off. It made her sad because she enjoyed getting the family together, but not sad enough to start doing  them again!", "When you think about it, though, he's actually excluding YOU. He's entertaining her at your expense.", "That's such a sad story. It's so common, unfortunately, even in this day and age. Women may have \"come a long way\" but we still have miles to go.", "Nope. Boundaries are needed now. \n\nHe calls his sister and lets her know she needs to budget x for meals. \n\nMeal plan in advance. Inform her of what she needs to pay in advance. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019s on her own for meals. Just like she does with snacks. \n\nShe will contribute to a daily tidy and everyone is responsible for their own laundry. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s ensure everyone has time to relax, and that we don\u2019t have to worry about budgets by getting it out of the way early\u201d he can say.", "Sitting it out one year might lead to a much better experience for EVERY one in the following years. So I'd consider not going and letting husband dearest dealing with his princess of a sister and see how he likes it, he'll change his tune.", "Sometimes you've talked all you can. He hasn't heard what you've been trying to tell him. Time for a silent strike. While you're away, choose what chores you think are fair to you, and just don't see the rest. There are two other adults there, they'll figure out how to pick up the slack. If you continue to discuss it ahead of time, you're just going to get more pushback and guilt-tripping.", ">Excited to experience it with my kids and to see their happy faces. My kids are the #1 priority which is why I\u2019m willing to suck it up. \n\nPass on being the stressed-out mom *this* time and don't go.\n\nHopefully, it should be enough for your husband to realize how much work his selfish sister is.", "Me, either. OP has started it so it's now habit. That's gotta stop now.", "Truth. I really hate going on vacation because the stress ramps up before we even leave. Between the planning, packing for everyone, making sure that everything is taken care of while we\u2019re gone, it\u2019s exhausting. Then having to do everything while there and being go, go, go and the stress on moms about making memories is real. Not to mention the stress of packing up and getting everything coordinated to get back to the daily grind and getting kids back on schedule."]}
