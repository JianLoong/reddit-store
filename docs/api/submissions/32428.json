On the side, I do handyman/maintenance for a friend\u2019s small property management company. \n\nLast week, I was planning to show up at a new tenant\u2019s house to get some small, non-urgent things taken care of. The day and time of the appointment I left up to the tenant because I was trying to be accommodating to her schedule. Before I left we had a family issue (I\u2019m leaving it vague because it would take too long to explain) come up that required me to stay home. As a rule, I give tenants a one to two hour timeframe as to when I\u2019ll be there. It\u2019s a standard practice and I\u2019ve never had any issues. I told this tenant I would be there in the 10 o\u2019clock hour. This tenant seemed to think that meant 10am sharp. My family issue unfolded around 10am right as I was leaving. \n\nBefore my wife and I made the decision for me to stay home, around 10:30 I got a nasty text from the tenant that I wasn\u2019t there right at 10am. I apologized profusely and explained to her I had to reschedule because of a family issue. She was NOT happy, which I understand. But also, my day was derailed too. \n\nShe went on for quite a while over text accusing me of being unprofessional and for no call/no showing her. I again apologized for the inconvenience it caused her but she didn\u2019t seem to care. \n\nI eventually politely offered her to contact the property manager, my friend who runs the small company, and chat with her about it. I was tired of her attitude and didn\u2019t think I could be polite any longer. I talked with my friend while this was playing out and she was 100% onboard with the way I handled it. Unfortunately, she seemed to take the \u201ccustomer is always right\u201d approach with this tenant and didn\u2019t address the way she was treating me. \n\nI feel a little hung out to dry.

Were you planning to make a decision by 10:40? By quarter of?\n\nJust how long would it have taken you to get your gear back together and drive over to the site, anyway? Was it even possible that you'd make it on time at this point?", "You had an emergency and weren't able to be there when you told the client you would be. Not a problem. You didn't tell the client. Small problem. \n\nClient is mad. Boss (property mgt) is fine with it.\n\nThere's no need for the client to apologize for being pissed that you didn't meet your commitment to them. \n\nThe client can be a angry as they want to. The only apologies due are from you 1) for not being there (you already made that one) and 2) for not informing the client promptly. \n\nYTA if you think that the client owes you an apology.", "INFO\n\nWhat time did you know that you'd have to reschedule?\n\nEDIT: YTA\n\nYou clearly dropped the ball.", "Yta so you decided to stay home and didn't bother letting the client know?  *They* had to text *you*?  Why did you not let them know???  They took time off of work, and rather than sitting around waiting for someone who wasn't going to show up, they could have gotten back some hours!", "YTA\n\nFirst, you were unclear about the original appointment time. Give a window, e.g. 10-11, or 10-12. Second, when you knew you had this family issue, you should have called the client immediately. Third, you show no respect for the time this client set aside to wait for you to show up. \n\nYour apologies afterwards did nothing to mitigate the inconvenience. And the tenant was right to be annoyed with your attitude, which appears to be \"well, I couldn't help it so it wasn't my fault\". Just because you are lackadaisical about your job and unreliable doesn't mean everyone else is. \n\nUnless this \"family issue\" was a house on fire or a major hospital run, you DID behave unprofessionally. You bailed on a job without explanation. And you were called on it.", "Sometimes things come up.  Sometimes there is nothing you can do about it.  But there are consequences to missing a job.  Irate customers are one of those.  \n\nSee it from the other side.  The customer needs something done and are paying someone to do it.  (Not up to you to decide if its urgent or not).  \n\nIf i go to a burger joint and order and they dont fulfill my order, then it was a shit experience.  Period.  Maybe not enough staff showed up that day.  Maybe the beef truck got hit by a train.  Maybe mad cow was found in the meat.  Maybe the cook had a family issue.  The customer doesnt care and they dont need to care.  \n\nEveryone should treat each other with respect, and maybe the customer didnt do that in this case.  Either way, your manager friend could either \"defend you\" and see the client leave and write some bad google reviews, or they can do what a manager is hired to do in those situations, and try their best to make it right, retain the customer, and salvage those dollars coming into the company after the job was left incomplete.  \n\n(Edited due to fat fingers accidentally hitting Post prematurely)", "YTA: Your family life is important, and you are a good dad for prioritizing that. Your friend is right to treat their business like a business however. The renter got screwed by taking their time to allow access to fix problems that should have been fixed before they moved in, and you ghosted them. No call, no show. Sure your wording about the time slot may have been in your favor, but you told them when they called you that you couldn't make it. You owe your friend a beer, and a bit more professionalism.", "YTA.  You told her 10am. Not 10-11 or some other range. I understand that things come up, but you should have texted. It is kind of crazy that you seem to be almost offended at the idea of holding to an appointment time. \n\nOf course your friend didn\u2019t back you. They\u2019re running a business and recognize that if their man doesn\u2019t act like a professional\u2014which you absolutely didn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s bad for their business. \n\nKeep this up and you\u2019re going to end up losing your job and your friend.", "NAH. In the future, I'd recommend you change the way you give your arrival time. Instead of saying \"within the 10 o'clock hour\" say \"between 10 and 11\" and include that you will reach out before you are leaving so they know approximately when to expect you. Or maybe you send a confirmation/reminder the day before so they know that you didn't forget about them. It is possible that the tenant booked time off work to be available on this day. It is understandable that they are frustrated.", "You could have notified the customer a little earlier, but you need to drop your butthurt-ness over this one thing. Customers have a way of being complete a\\*holes sometimes.", "NTA - but yeah, we\u2019ve all been burned by service windows before so of course theyll be pissed you were \u201clate\u201d and now cancelling. \n\nYour friend needs to preserve this relationship to some degree so dont take it to personally.", "My ARRIVAL window was in the 10am hour, but it was 2-3 hours worth of work, which I had communicated when making the appointment. I didn\u2019t commit to only being there for the 10am hour. The plan was to get my house in order and leave or call and reschedule. And yes, truck was loaded and ready and I had plenty of time to get there. Hope that helps!", "NTA. Life happens. It was not like the pipes were busted.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP is a stay at home dad so it's annoying if someone reschedules work on him but he schedules stuff around his family. It feels like he forgets that for the tenant to be home, they likely had to take time off work to be there during the day. Or if they work nights, stay up.\n\nWhatever.\n\nWas the tenant's response great? Probably not. But there are have been times I've been disproportionately annoyed with service people. Typically about appointment times.\n\nAlso, OP- if you tell someone you're going to be there at the 10 o'clock hour, people are going to think you mean at 10am. Just say that you'll be there between Time and Time. Don't make this a language game."]}
