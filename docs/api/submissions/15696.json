How much longer did he reasonably expect you to wait? Doggy needs stairs STAT.", "NTA. I keep seeing these woodworking posts, \"wife wanted x, I made it myself for 3 times the price\".", "NTA- I\u2019m pretty much in the same boat with my 13yr old pup. I\u2019ve brought it up repeatedly and after almost a year, still no stairs or ramp, so I will be buying a ramp for my pup with the next pay check. I don\u2019t care if we can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019m not begging anymore and my pup won\u2019t live forever.

The stairs were a necessity, and rather than fighting about it, you just came up with an alternate solution because the plan wasn\u2019t working. That\u2019s fine! If he finishes the stairs maybe you can use them somewhere in the home?", "Hey, if a man says he'll do something, he will. There's no need to keep reminding him every month.\n\nBut yeah, NTA.", "NAH - there\u2019s no mention of a conflict here.", "NTA but why didn\u2019t you just do it yourself? I\u2019ve built some fairly simple things & I\u2019m not super handy. That\u2019s what google is for.", "YTA\n\nYour dog could have waited, it's probably more loyal to your husband than you are and would not have used the Amazon stairs had it known the situation that was going on.

If he pulls through, then you could just return, sell, or repurpose the one you bought.", "NTA I'm in the exact same position as you (except for the fact that I have a wife). After 15 years, I don't even ask her any more. I just tell her what I need and we find it already built together. Her job is physically strenuous and there just isn't enough time for her to work, work on home projects, get errands done and have quality time together. There's also that little bit about how the cobbler's children have no shoes lol", "NTA. Btw, I bought a ramp for an older great dane who can't jump well any more. He doesn't trust it.

Also, the worst that happens is that you end up with two sets of dog stairs/ramps and can use them in different places :)", "NTA \n\nThat's nearly 2 dog years your dog was waiting"]}
