I, too, am hard of hearing.  I was diagnosed with bilateral otosclerosis, my right ear being the more severe.  My father had it, and only had 15% of his hearing in one ear and 5% in the other.  I had surgery to implant a prosthetic device in my right ear, but the disease is progressive so my hearing has deteriorated.  \n\nThe goal is to make communication with other people the best it can be for your son.  It's typically a multi-solution approach.  He will run into many people in the world who don't know ASL, as the majority of the population is hearing.  If aids help to hear sound, those should be encouraged.  Like your son, I know ASL, as does my daughter.  My son, not so much.  I don't expect family to learn it.  My dad was a proficient lip reader.  I use a combination of lip reading, which requires people to always face us and speak clearly.  I use bone conductive BAHA implants, sign, vibrations felt through the hands and feet, whatever helps.\n\nIt's only my opinion, but I think that cutting off communication with his aunt, insisting she needs to learn to sign (I've studied it for years and still taking refreshers...it's not easy to become fluent.  But if his aids help him to hear, you should NOT discourage him from using them.  Your sister may choose to stay away, but he will run into classmates, friends, co-workers, people in all types of situations and businesses and they don't usually sign.  I learned all I did because I wanted to be able to fully participate in the world around me.  That meant I needed to learn to communicate with everyone as much as possible.

Her nephew is going to be excluded in certain things and experiences in his life due to being different, his family should be the ones to support him.

She shouldn\u2019t have ignored your son because of the communication barrier. Absolutely banning her is a bit much though. Tell her that she needs to interact with him even if she can\u2019t really sign or only learns a couple of signs. \n\nI grew up with a deaf friend and many of us tried to learn just a little. In college he actually taught me how to sign a phrase or two since I had a regular customer at my job who was deaf. I don\u2019t know that I could still use those phrases though. \nI\u2019ve known deaf people who are completely nonverbal and some who don\u2019t sign and many who fall in the middle and I\u2019ve managed to communicate with them all at least a little (we lived close to a deaf school for about 5 years and many who had attended the school stayed in the area as adults). I think your sister can find a way to overcome the language barrier here even if she never really learns to sign at all. \n\nI hope your son is eventually willing to try a different hearing aid too. Convincing a 4 year old to give anything they disliked a second chance is always hard. It sounds like it\u2019s a bit frustrating in a few ways right now. I would try to talk to your sister and ask if there\u2019s a reason why she hasn\u2019t learned any signs and strategize ways she can still interact with your son even if you can\u2019t facilitate communication between them. I think there are solutions short of banning her until she can sign some. Honestly if she\u2019s willing to give it another try I would have the kids teach her some signs.

They aren't asking the sister to become fluent in ASL quickly or even possibly at all. All auntie needs at this point are some basic signs to play (toy, puzzle, blocks, outside, etc.)  and a piece of paper and some crayons if she gets stuck so they can communicate in pictures. The post is saying she doesn't even do this and flat out ignores the 4 year old. Kids understand communication issues even if they are frustrated by them, and it's not all that hard to work around it honestly. Aunt/Sister is definitely the asshole here.

As much as I want to learn ASL myself, it just does not click in my brain so I know it might not be by choice that she can't learn it, she could even just be too proud to admit she can't.

So learning is not needed.\n\nThese N T A commenters clearly doesn\u2019t know a shit about, what it means to live a life with a disability.", "NTA. She has some nerve demanding that your son wear something that causes him physical discomfort in his own home.\n\nOne of my oldest friends was born to Russian-speaking parents. How arrogant would I have been, if I\u2019d ignored their hospitality because they refused to speak Greek to me?", "No, make him wear it even though it causes him excruciating pain, big difference. She\u2019s the T A big time. You have to space out the T A in your sentence or the moderators will tally that as a vote against OP. Someone told me that once.", "You also really don't need a common language to play with a 4 year old.", "I agree with encouraging the son to wear the hearing aids. \nI\u2019m hard of hearing, but it isn\u2019t very severe, my hearing loss was only discovered when I was already ten years old. (I tend to just guess what people say and read lips and people just thought I was purposely not listening or that I was daydreaming when I didn\u2019t react as a child.) \nAnd when I got them I didn\u2019t want to wear the hearing aids, I hated how they feel and I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cdifferent\u201d (I guess I had internalised ableism) and I only used them in school. \n\nI still hate wearing my hearing aids but I know it would be easier to do if I started as a little child. When you\u2019re older it\u2019s much more difficult to get used to hearing aids.", "Absolutely. It's funny OP doesn't want to put in the effort to help her child with hearing aids but expects her sister to put in the effort to learn a whole new language. Honestly she needs to prepare that kid for the real world and she can't go around to all of his jobs or social situations telling everyone around him they have to learn ASL. He will have to adapt eventually and she's setting him up for failure.", "The sister is definitely in the wrong here, but stating \u201cfor fuck wake a 4 year old kid can learn it\u201d in a manner that suggests \u201cif a 4 year old can do it an adult should be able to do it even more easily\u201d is completely wrong. Children learn languages much easier than adults. There is a lot of science behind this and I won\u2019t go into the details, but basically their brains are in a state that is more accepting of new syntax (grammar) and words. It\u2019s far easier and less effort for a 4 year old to learn a new language then a 27 year old. \n\nDoesn\u2019t change the situation presented by the OP and the fact that the sister sucks here, but it does affect the basis of your argument that the sister should be able to do it just because a 4 year old can.", "Just to interject, it\u2019s very likely that sign language is the son\u2019s first language so it wasn\u2019t any harder for him to learn it than any other child with a first language. Him learning it is a normal development.", "The kid is 4. He is not comfortable. Her son shouldn't be uncomfortable cause aunt is an AH.", "She didn\u2019t say the medical device was abuse. She said it felt abusive to force her 4 year old child to wear hearing aids when they caused him to scream. \n\n Also, while you may have experience as a person with partial hearing loss, OP\u2019s father has both direct experience as a fully deaf person and with his son\u2019s typical behavior. I feel that he is far better qualified to make a judgement call on this than you are.", ">What if your sister did try to learn it, but it was too difficult for her to learn?\n\nThat's kind of the thing - effort is noticed and appreciated. The sister hasn't made the effort.", "Good cause she sucks and is being an awful aunt", "What an ableist take.", "Who said anything about pain, let alone excruciating? She just said the kid yelled when he wore it.", "This is what utterly baffles me. My nephew didn't utter a word until he was like 3.5. We still managed to play. Sister is being cruel.", "My kids made friends with a refugee family that moved onto our street. The kids had no language in common (the other kids are picking up E glish pretty fast) but damn can they play some awesome games. It's adorable and sweet and really shows that kids don't care about differences all that much if they aren't taught to care about the differences.", ">The kid is 4. He is not comfortable. Her son shouldn't be uncomfortable cause aunt is an AH.\n\nIt's not about the aunt, it's about preparing him for the real world where 99.99% of people won't know ASL. It's about providing to him one of the five important senses. Again, I have hearing loss. It *sucks.* I don't gave directional hearing. Which direction did that noise come from?  Is it near or far? I have no idea!\n\nThe kid could be *less disabled* through technology. Think about that for a second.\n\n4 year olds will complain about ANYTHING. A hearing aid isn't something that mama should budge on, especially if papa wears one.", "He'll never be comfortable with his mother around. A parent's job isn't to shelter their kids in a cocoon and stunt their growth, it's to push them to try new things and grow. You can't let a 4 year old make all the decisions.", ">She didn\u2019t say the medical device was abuse. She said it felt abusive to force her 4 year old child to wear hearing aids when they caused him to scream. \n>\n\nYeah, kids often fight stuff that's good for them. News at 11. Why is the child screaming? It's certainly not pain. \n\n\n> Also, while you may have experience as a person with partial hearing loss, OP\u2019s father has both direct experience as a fully deaf person and with his son\u2019s typical behavior. I feel that he is far better qualified to make a judgement call on this than you are.\n\nBecause parents always make perfectly informed medical decisions for their kids. The dad uses them. The mom, who doesn't, sees it as abuse. It's not, she is wrong, and you should know better than to blindly believe everyone because you feel like they're adjacent to experts.", "the first thing they teach you in asl classes along with sign is deaf culture. they very much do not like being called disabled and often will fight with family members who get aids or implants or have their children because to them, deaf is not a disability", "It's not selfish to not have time to learn an entire new language. That's asking a lot of someone. Ableist isn't a word.", "plus asl is not super hard to learn the basics of. learning the alphabet is the easiest thing and should be known by everyone in my opinion", "literally LEARN THE DAMN ALPHABET. at least you can spell it out. not to mention at least where i\u2019m at in the very conservative northwest usa, it\u2019s preschool curriculum to learn basic signs. you can learn the alphabet in a day or two", "This! Even if she doesn\u2019t speak your son\u2019s language, it doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t communicate with him, she chooses not to and twice.\n\nYour are NTA but she is for two reasons, 1. demanding that your son wear hearing aids when he doesn\u2019t want to, 2. ignoring her nephew for something he has no control over\n\nI\u2019m really glad that the rest of your family and your son\u2019s friends and teachers are able to embrace deaf culture and not alienate him.\n\nWhatever your sister\u2019s reasons, you are in the right for protecting your children from such toxicity.", "Usually a child\u2019s yell is a sign of discomfort or pain. It\u2019s also pretty well documented that hearing aids/implants can be incredibly uncomfortable for the wearer. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a reach to assume pain here.", "One can pretty simply extrapolate that if he\u2019s screaming when forced to put it on, it could be hurting him. Not that big of a reach. Especially in the case of a small child; it\u2019s difficult to get anything sized appropriately, let alone medical equipment.", "Having a child discomfortable to make him \"less disabled is just mean. They probably following the doctors advice. No one would pull the hearing aid of a child without having a specialist involved specially since the father is also deaf.\nRight now the kid is fine with ASL, traumatizing this kid forcing him to wear a hearing aid his brain can't even understand is not the good thing you think it is.", ">deaf is not a disability\n\nYes, it is.\n\nDeaf culture has also culminated in some morally questionable acts, like deaf parents undergoing IVF specifically to ensure that their child was born deaf.\n\nEdit: my bad, I didn't fully understand your comment. Early morning, brain still waking up.", "First off, a 4 year old absolutely can understand.\n\nSecond, the discomfort is extremely minimal after a short period. Glasses also suck at first. Would you be okay with a parent eschewing their child's vision because the kid didn't like glasses? No? Find the difference. Again, I've been fitted for aids. They're not much worse than earbuds.", "WTF", "way to take what i said out of context congrats. technically you\u2019re correct it is. but to deaf people they don\u2019t view it that way. and how is them wanting a child like them and using ivf to get that (which btw is not how ivf works but okay go off) any different then hearing parents doing the same ? you realize people are now doing tests to make sure the kid looks how they want, yet having a child who can speak the same language as the family is bad?", "Assuming you're reacting to the \"intentionally deaf child\" bit, here's an [article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/09/genetics.medicalresearch) about one such couple that has been blocked by a Parliament bill.\n\nIn any case, this is probably the important part \n\n>will block any attempt by couples like Garfield and Lichy to use modern medical techniques to ensure their children are deaf.\n\nThis was a topic of discussion in my bioethics and medical ethics classes alike. Finding specific cases is difficult because of patient anonymity and so on, but they exist.", "Yes, I realized what I misunderstood what you were saying and edited my comment.\n\nThat said: \n\n>but to deaf people they don\u2019t view it that way.\n\nDoesn't change the fact that it is a disability\n\n>and how is them wanting a child like them and using ivf to get that (which btw is not how ivf works but okay go off) any different then hearing parents doing the same ?\n\nI'm using IVF as a blanket term because it's widely understood. \n\nThe procedure is very commonly used to ensure that a child is born ***healthy***, and this does not change the fact that being deaf is, objectively, a disability. That is the difference.\n\n>you realize people are now doing tests to make sure the kid looks how they want,\n\nI'm against designer babies.\n\n>yet having a child who can speak the same language as the family is bad?\n\nYou're drawing a false equivalence. Being bilingual and being deaf are not the same thing."]}
