There\u2019s nothing wrong with any of this or how you feel. What you should do is start regifting all these useless gifts to them the following year though. And anyone I her family that bring complains, I\u2019d just explain that this is not something your family really does and you\u2019d prefer to not be a part of the gifts, but you love/like the food, socializing, games etc.", "NTA\n\nAn idea may be to pick a couple charities (do your research though) & ask the family to donate in your name as your \u201cpresent\u201d instead? They may still give you cards to open, but they\u2019ll feel good & also be doing good\u2026 & you don\u2019t end up with a load of stuff you don\u2019t want. \n\nYou could also pick a family in need & have people get gifts for them or something along those lines. Just ideas from a conflict avoidant person lol", "NTA. It would be funny if you suggested at the gathering this year that next year everyone pitches in to donate to a good cause instead of doing gifts. You'll see a lot of wide, blinking eyes, and hear a loud, awkward silence.", "Used to have this well-intentioned problem...but with a little bit of Xmas-spirit-guilt, we switched a similar family dynamic around into money-bombs for various charities - usually animal rescues, [heifer.org](http://heifer.org) and other agricultural or adopt-an-animal programs, that sort of thing. \n\nThe people who want to give or unwrap something can still give the donation-related swag like t-shirts and stuffed animals - but usually it's just a small token, and a lovely afternoon of \"Oh \"Wow, Punkinpie gave me Bees!\" or \"Look, Uncle Bob gave Punkinpie a Snow Leopard!\"", "NTA. I feel very much as you do. I rarely want for anything. I am also, at F 57 yo, not a materialistic person.\n\nIt is obvious to me why you want to bow out of this family tradition. Who knows which other relatives agree with you? Statistically, someone(s) are in the crowd of family that feel as you do.\n\nI love having family together and want to give them whatever they want. I recently was gifted some sort of Video Alexa for Christmas - through work. My first and only thought was to sell it; I don't have any \"intelligent\" devices in my home.  \n\nThis year my gift to my husband is whatever cookies he wants once a month every month. I don't enjoy sweets, yet I am a great cook and decent baker. He adores sweets, so it is a joy for me to do something that he truly enjoys. Does he want more cologne? not really.\n\nYou are fighting an uphill battle. Difficult? Yes, impossible? No.", "NTA! I agree with you!!", "NTA as long as everyone knows your position.\n\nI'm the same. I hate getting gifts and I hate buying gifts even more. To me, Christmas is just another day which annoys my family. I feel the same about birthdays too.", "Will they even notice with that many presents. Stick to your guns, good for you for getting away from that company driven consumerism. NTA", "Soft NTA.  In a relationship you have to compromise.  You could be gracious and just suck it up for one day so as to not make your girlfriend feel uncomfortable", "I totally get not getting everyone else a present, you are never obliged to do that - especially if they are excessive in their gifting. You could consider being clear with a budget per gift or a wish list (which is what my family does) so you don\u2019t get useless shit etc, so NTA there. \n\nBut it\u2019s unclear, please tell me you bought your girlfriend presents for her?", "NOT the ahole whatsoever. I have a side of the family that does this vulgar display of opulence and material excess at Christmas (they're \"suburban doctors neighborhood\" wealthy) and it used to be make me nearly suffocate from nausea growing up (until I became an adult and gradually phased myself out of that annual gig with that side). Materialism is the asshole, not you.", "NTA but I would join in. Every family is annoying in some way. Becoming an in-law means joining your gf's family and accepting some of their annoying quirks. They are trying to include you and love you the best they can. You're never required to accept what they're offering (that's why NTA).\n\nOne thing: YWBTA if you took presents from your in- laws without offering anything in return. Really, just stay away from the gift exchange entirely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m in my 40\u2019s and at this point, if I want something I buy it for myself. Plus my house is small and cramped working from home so I just don\u2019t have anymore space for stuff I won\u2019t use much.

Shopping for them is the most stressful thing ever and they **do not** need any more stuff. And I don\u2019t need stuff from them. They already help my wife and I so much during the rest of the year. \n\nI got them to finally agree to **one** gift per person/couple and then to, as a family, go balls out on a charity.", "Nta\n\n\nHonestly, it sounds like a lot. The older I get, the more difficult Christmas becomes where gift giving is considered. \n\n\nIf you have all that you want or you just don't see the point in spending exorbitant amounts of money, I get it.\n\nChristmas is about spending time with your loved ones and not about how much you can spend. \n\nStand by your boundaries.", "NTA.  Honestly, I would just leave the gifts there.  Don't take them, don't unwrap them, don't even acknowledge them.", "That's a good idea. I would probably still tell people I want nothing then if they persist, direct them to charity", "I think it\u2019s financially reckless to spend hundreds of dollars on a whole bunch of stuff because other people can\u2019t respect your boundaries.

And she is allowed to get me stuff too.", "I don't really understand the second half of your post. To miss the gift exchange I would have to miss Christmas entirely. We live close to them so that would be an asshole move. I have told people I don't want anything, If someone walks up to me with a present am I supposed to refuse it? That also seems like an asshole move", "Maybe say something along the lines of 'I seriously don't do gifts, but if you MUST get me something, I would be over the moon if you donated to a needy family in my name.  THIS gift would absolutely make my X-Mas'?\n\nNTA.  Not everyone likes the materialism of X-Mas.", "If it\u2019s a financial hardship absolutely.  If it\u2019s important to his girlfriend maybe do it but no obligation.  My point is that sometimes you make compromises in relationships", "Oh good. Lol definitely NTA.", "OK! The key thing is that you don't put yourself in a situation where someone is giving you a gift without being totally clear that you have nothing for them. If you open the gift and then say \"oh yeah, I didn't get you anything,\" that's asshole behavior.", "They\u2019ll ignore the point of him not wanting gifts and focus on the fact he got nothing for them. \n\nIf you\u2019re trying to speed run them making you the bad guy, that\u2019s the way to do it."]}
