{"id": 2670, "submission_id": "yyw6je", "title": "AITA For not giving a bonus to employee?", "selftext": "I'm a 56F and I have an employee we'll call Holly that is 29F.  She's been at our small company (we have 9 employees) which my husband and I own for 6 almost 7 years.  Every holiday season we have our holiday lunch at a either a steak house or a fancy restaurant during work hours.  For the first few years Holly came to the party (but she's very antisocial and did not eat much or seem to be enjoying herself).  But for the last 2 years Holly has refused to come.  Last year I told her that if she didn't come that I wouldn't be giving her the yearly bonus check that we present to everyone and she still refused to come. I asked her directly why not, and she bluntly said that she can't stand to eat with us, and that 2 of the employees smack their food and speak while eating, and she can't stomach sitting at a table with them for 2 hours.  \n\nWhile I agreed that I did notice the bad table manners, I felt that it was extremely rude to not come so I said okay and let her stay behind and did not give her a bonus that year.  This year, I once again asked Holly if she was coming so I could plan the reservation and she again said no.  So I said okay. \n\nYesterday my husband was helping me put the holiday cards together (where we put the bonus checks in) and asked where Holly's was, and I told him that she's not coming so she isn't getting one and he blew up at me.  He says since Holly has been there so long and is one of our best employee's that we should just give her one anyways, but I still refuse to.  I think if she can't sit and eat a meal with us for 2 hours (even though it's on the clock and we're paying her to) then she shouldn't get one.  If anyone is wondering, hers would be $500.  To me, that should be enough incentive.  She's not rich and is single so she's paying all her own bills.  I don't understand it and was hoping to get others views.

Team Holly in this, you\u2019re a giant asshole for withholding her well deserved bonus.", "Oh yes, YTA. Massively. She's a loyal employee, but anti-social and the sound of smacking drives her crazy. Have you thought perhaps she's a little neuro-divergent?? I have mild BPD, anxiety and depression. The sound of smacking while eating makes me crazy. Add that to a large crowd at a command performance and what you get is a red-alert anxiety attack. Give this young lady her bonus for this year AND last year as well.as a sincere apology.", "YTA. Her not coming to the party has ZERO effect on what she does to help your company earn money. I wouldn't want to watch people eat with disgusting table manners either, and to hold a bonus she worked for over her head over one dinner is disgusting.\n\nThe people who do get the bonus seem to be receiving it just for sitting at the table with you.

Jeez what is your issue. She\u2019s one of your best employees and because she doesn\u2019t want to come to the Christmas meal she gets no bonus? Why are you forcing your own social ideals on her?

She's not rich and is single so she's paying all her own bills... I don't understand it\n\nI'll help you understand.

She may be uncomfortable with social situations like this, may be uncomfortable eating in front of people, or (very likely) could have misophonia. Or some combination. From what you wrote alone it sounds like there's a good chance you're discriminating against someone with a disability or medical condition.

To me, it sounds like she probably attended the second meal just to remain cordial, and when given the opportunity to opt out for the third time, she took it. You aren't losing money if she doesn't RSVP, and she gave you a valid justification as to why she doesn't want to attend - it's clearly not intended to be a personal slight. \n\nYour husband is right - if Holly has been with the company a long time and she's as good of an employee as he says she is, she's an asset and should be rewarded for it.

She's been at our small company (we have 9 employees) which my husband and I own for 6 almost 7 years.  Every holiday season we have our holiday lunch at a either a steak house or a fancy restaurant during work hours.  For the first few years Holly came to the party (but she's very antisocial and did not eat much or seem to be enjoying herself).  But for the last 2 years Holly has refused to come.  Last year I told her that if she didn't come that I wouldn't be giving her the yearly bonus check that we present to everyone and she still refused to come. I asked her directly why not, and she bluntly said that she can't stand to eat with us, and that 2 of the employees smack their food and speak while eating, and she can't stomach sitting at a table with them for 2 hours.  \n\nWhile I agreed that I did notice the bad table manners, I felt that it was extremely rude to not come so I said okay and let her stay behind and did not give her a bonus that year.  This year, I once again asked Holly if she was coming so I could plan the reservation and she again said no.  So I said okay. \n\nYesterday my husband was helping me put the holiday cards together (where we put the bonus checks in) and asked where Holly's was, and I told him that she's not coming so she isn't getting one and he blew up at me.  He says since Holly has been there so long and is one of our best employee's that we should just give her one anyways, but I still refuse to.  I think if she can't sit and eat a meal with us for 2 hours (even though it's on the clock and we're paying her to) then she shouldn't get one.  If anyone is wondering, hers would be $500.  To me, that should be enough incentive.  She's not rich and is single so she's paying all her own bills.  I don't understand it and was hoping to get others views.

Hopefully your husband had some principles and ensures she receives her deserved bonus.", "Yta for denying a hardworking employee their bonus that they earned because they won\u2019t sit and have dinner with you\u2026 get over yourself.", "YTA and a bit immature.\n\nHer bonus is based off of, assumingly, her work for the company and the company's success YOY. It is not based on whether she attends this ONE dinner or not. So, you're withholding something that your employee has rightfully earned. \n\nHonestly, after writing this out, this sounds like thievery.", "YTA what kind of despicable mind do you have? Seriously, what an absolute awful person you are.\n\nAlso on a side note, fair play on Holly for avoiding adults who eat like toddlers.", "YTA I cannot fathom how shitty of a person you would have to be to withhold someone\u2019s Christmas bonus for simply not wanting to come to a work lunch. Like wow.", "YTA - Bonuses at their heart are both a thank you for doing good work, and a retention tool to keep good employees around. You are essentially saying to her your gratitude to her for being a good employee for seven years is not as important as her attendance - where you absolutely know she will be miserable whether it's because of the smacking or just because she's not a very social person for whatever reason - at this one lunch. This is not you standing on principal, this is you just being focused on Holly doing what you tell her to because you're her boss, because her being at this lunch doesn't actually advance the interests of your business in any way. \n\nAlso $500 is a paltry annual bonus for someone who has been one of your best employees for 7 years. I have no idea what industry you are in or where you are located, but I hope you get visited by a few ghosts in the middle of the night and figure out how to do right by the people whose labor your business relies upon, or I hope Holly gets poached by a competitor.", "YTA.

I can\u2019t believe you even have to ask.", "YTA.\n\nMy husband and I are small business owners who give out year end bonuses to our employees FOR THEIR JOB PERFORMANCE.

Either of this is absolutely illegal outside of the US.\n\nYou also need to stop combining the employment relationship with personal feelings.", "YTA, and honestly one of the most disgusting and miserable, dark-souled people I have ever seen on this sub. I could spell out for you exactly why but you literally already did - you are obviously a spiteful, malignant narcissist with no self awareness. there\u2019s likely nothing I, or anyone, can say to you. I hope Holly finds out you are (or were) going to withhold her bonus over this and finds a new job. I would go so far as to hope your business goes under and your worse-than-Lucille-bluth self learns a few lessons the hard way, but thankfully for your employees, it sounds like at least your husband has a brain or soul.", "YTA she\u2019s earned her bonus especially if she\u2019s one of your best employees.

I\u2019m not reading all the comments but some people have a medical condition where smacking actually hurts their ears. It sucks. It\u2019s painful. She earned the bonus. She deserves it. Your an a hole.", "YTA, this is how you end up discriminating against non-neurotypical employees or employees with disabilities. She may have misophonia or something like that. If she earned a bonus through her performance she shouldn\u2019t have to do a social outing just to get the check.", "So her refusal to put herself in a situation she finds uncomfortable and not enjoyable negates all the hard work she\u2019s done throughout the year(s)?\n\nWhat a horrible incentive. Frankly if I were her I\u2019d have left the moment you said the only way to get it would be to go to this dinner. \n\nYTA and apparently do not appreciate the hard work of your loyal employees. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s immaturity or ignorance. I hope this girl finds a job where they actually appreciate her and give her the recognition she deserves.", "OP, I work for the state. I oversee the *governor*. And my organization has a yearly holiday dinner and guess what? It's not mandatory, nor does anyone in the entire organization hold it against someone regardless of their reason. We still get our bonuses and guess what? \n\nI didn't go this year. My organization still gave me a bonus *and* let me choose an anniversary gift that was a gaming headset, keyboard and mouse. \n\nYTA. You are being petty and punishing an employee for not wanting to interact with work after work hours. \n\nThat's ridiculous.", "Yta. What a grinch because you don\u2019t get your way. I hope her holiday bonus to you is a resignation letter.", "YTA. I\u2019d be reporting you to my states labor board for this. Withholding a bonus because she doesn\u2019t want to go to a team lunch? Utter bullshit and I\u2019m shocked Holly has stuck around after his pulled this. I would have had resumes out the day after you first pulled this stunt.", "YTA - why don't you retain the bonus from the people with 'bad table manners'?  Sounds like Holly is not the problem here.", "Yikes YTA. \n\nThat's definitely unfair of you and kinda vengeful? \n\nIf Holly doesn't want to come, don't make her. If she finds it so repulsive that she can't stomach it for two hours as her boss I think you need to respect that. People know their own boundaries better than you, and everyone is different. What is unbearable for some, is not a big deal for others. \n\nI think you should be treating her with a bit more respect if she's been working with you for as long as you say. \n\nI'm not saying change everything for one persok but If everyone isn't enjoying themselves, why not try something else? Maybe you can ask your other employees if there is something they would rather do? \n\nDo a team building thing, like an escape room, a board game cafe, an office murder mystery party, etc. An activity rather than a meal.", "YTA. I didn't read the whole thing, I couldn't after ai read that you blackmailed her. I'm pretty sure your ultimatum is illegal", "YTA for being petty. She does her job and was honest about why she doesn\u2019t enjoy participating in the holiday lunch. Wtf you\u2019re a huge AH.", "YTA. The bonus should be about how hard she has been working all year and not if she is willing to entertain you and others while feeling really uncomfortable. If she doesn't want to come and it is work hours, then if you want her to stay behind and work fine, but forcing this social situation on someone who you know is anti social is so wrong. If she is as good as your husband says and has been with you for so long, is it worth potentially losing her?", "So she does great work 365 days a year, but doesn't want to eat dinner with you so she doesn't get her money?? **YTA.**", "Yea, YTA. If she doesn\u2019t want to be around you all, that\u2019s her business. You are putting yourself at risk to lose a great employee. Don\u2019t complain when she leaves.", "YTA\n\nI don't think you understand the point of holiday parties or bonuses. They're supposed to be gifts for your workers for jobs well done and helping your business succeed in the previous year. Is the lunch a nice gesture for your guests or is it just a tool to feed your ego? It's not a nice gesture when you blackmail people into coming, which is exactly what you are trying to do.\n\nThis is extremely childish and manipulative of you. Give her her bonus and give her a break for not coming to the holiday lunch.", "YTA and literally no one is going to agree with you that you are in the right. \n\nIs the bonus for the good work she\u2019s done for you for years or a tool to force people to spend time with you? If someone is willing to forfeit $500 to not hang out with you for two hours, that should tell you something.", "YTA. You can\u2019t withhold a bonus from an employee because she doesn\u2019t want to attend a social work function.", "And they even know Holly could use the money, and hold it over her head anyway.
