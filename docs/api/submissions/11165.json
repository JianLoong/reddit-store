During the week, with work and school schedules, I usually get up around 6-6:30am and take her for her daily morning walk. That gets me back home in time to be sure my kids are ready for school and get out to the bus on time. \n\nThere is a family (we'll call them the Smiths) who lives nearby (basically around the corner). They've lived in the house for a few years, but had a baby last year. I don't really know them. They also have a dog - the dog is sweet enough, but is very hyper and seems (to me) to be poorly trained/not trained. \n\nWhile I do vary my walking routes each morning (I usually let my dog decide where she wants to go each day), some mornings, I pass by the Smith's house. And, each time I do, their crazy dog starts whining, barking and scratching at the sidelights on their door. It's definitely loud enough that I hear it outside, even when I'm on the other side of the street.\n\nLast week, I was out with my dog in the afternoon and Mrs. Smith was outside. I'd never spoken to her before. She said, \"Hello, can I talk to you for a minute?\" I was like \"Umm, ok.\" She said, \"Do you walk your dog by here in the early mornings?\" I said, \"Well, sometimes, but not every day.\" She said, \"Well, I'd appreciate it if you could not do that. When you come by that early, the dog barks, it wakes the baby up and he doesn't go back to sleep. It's been really hard on us.\"\n\nI said, \"I'm sorry to hear that, but I think asking someone not to use a public thoroughfare is an unreasonable request. Training your dog is probably a better option. I know I walk by in the mornings, but I also know several of your neighbors also have dogs and I'm sure they pass by your home as well. Working with a trainer would probably be a good investment for your family.\"\n\nWell, she got a sour look on her face and said \"Thanks for absolutely nothing\" and stomped off back inside.\n\nAITA for not avoiding her house in the early mornings with my dog?\n\nEDIT: **their baby is NOT a newborn** (some posters seem to think so). The baby is about a year old now, maybe a bit less. My first interaction with her was just last week. I might not have responded as I did if the child was a newborn.
