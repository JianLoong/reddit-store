She should also be completely used to the way Tommy refers to her mum, as he's been doing it literally her whole life. \n\nI know your brother said they'd talked to Nova about the issue, but it honestly doesn't sound like they have. They're just allowing her to do and say what she wants, no matter how harmful to Tommy it is. It sounds to me like the parents agree with Nova, but are allowing her to do the dirty work here. For this idea that Tommy should consider your SIL as his mum to have stuck to such an extent for such a long time, it isn't just coming from Nova, someone's encouraging her belief, and that's most likely her parents. If the parents didn't agree with this, this whole thing would have been stopped when Nova was still a little kid. \n\nIf they're not careful, they're going to lose Tommy entirely. If this bullying from Nova continues, with the parents continuing to fail to intervene and make her stop, he will cut contact.
