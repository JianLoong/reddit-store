Everything has been great for the most part. We have been talking about marriage, moving in together, having children and all that for around 2 months.\n\nI work in a private equity firm and I will take over my dad's hedge fund when he retires in around 10 years. My girl is studying medicine to become a surgeon; she is currently completing her residency. She has occasionally expressed her disdain for the long hours, rude patients, night shifts, being on-call etc. I told her that it comes with the territory and it's something she has just got to get past. I don't like when I have 12+ hour days but it is what it is.\n\nMy partner is academically gifted according to her professors but she has some terrible financial habits. She spends most of what she earns, barely saves anything and doesn't make any investments. In an effort to get her to be more 'money-savvy', I decided to teach her about financial discipline and investing. To do this, I showed her my own investment portfolio (which I have never shown anyone aside from my parents) to illustrate my progress throughout the years and how she could do something similar with her own money.\n\nHowever, this took an unexpected turn. We started talking about our individual finances. I told her about my dad's company and investments and she told me about her parents restaurant business which barely breaks even. We had a discussion about this for over 2 weeks and she asked me if she could quit her residency. She had always complained about work like anyone would about their 9-5 but I never thought she would want to quit entirely. When I asked why, she said that she wasn't particularly fond of the work and that I have enough money to take care of us both. I told her that it would be unfair to place the entire financial burden on me to which she said that I could easily afford it so it shouldn't matter. She said that she would find something to do but she doesn't want to study again.\n\nI don't like how she suddenly switched up and wants to quit. It seems incredibly unfair how she can just drop her entire career just because I can afford a nice lifestyle for the both of us. I told her that she could maybe take a break for a week after completing her residency to think about it but she wanted to quit then and there. I told her that she had to toughen up and get through atleast the residency but she got mad and told me I wasn't being understanding enough. We ended up getting into a huge fight and have not talked in three days.\n\nSome history: She studied bio-med initially for 3 years, then did her Doctor of medicine which was 6 years. Then, she started her residency which she will be completing in 3 months. Afterwards, her plan was to apply for the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons\u2019 Surgical Training program which is another 6 years to finish.", "created_utc": 1677579239, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11e2jhl/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_to_become_a_surgeon/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m asking as you mentioned she had complained a lot about it previously. Granted no job is perfect and we will all naturally complain. \n\nSo, playing devil\u2019s advocate off of my own career pivots in medicine: It\u2019s not uncommon for people to get really close to the end of such a huge study program and want to quit it, despite being so close. That\u2019s when they need cheer leaders to hype us on. I\u2019m also wondering if this was truly the career path she wanted, or if it\u2019s something she felt pressured into growing up. And then on seeing your finances, did it become a tangible possibility that she didn\u2019t have to go down this career path? I will say, she\u2019s undoubtedly exhausted after this study program, and may need a year long break to figure out what she wants to do. Medicine in Australia (and the US) isn\u2019t always a high flying high earning career.\n\nNow obviously that may have nothing to do with it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for her to expect that she\u2019ll live off of your money as this wasn\u2019t something you agreed to. I really think you two need to talk some more about it, and be open to listening to her about why she wants to quit so that you can understand what the reasoning is.\n\nTelling her to \u201ctoughen up\u201d is definitely not the way to go. I appreciate why you\u2019d feel that btw, but sometimes quitting something **is** the tougher option. Money aside, that could come across to her as saying her career dreams and aspirations are unimportant to your relationship. How can you work together as life partners in helping her find a satisfying career?", "info: Australian residents get a very rough time and some become very mentally distressed, but cannot admit it.   Have you a way she can access counselling and not be reported for it?\n\n\nGiven how brutal Australian residency is I doubt it is about the money- it sounds more about the availability of alternatives.", "INFO did she ever *ask* for financial advice? Because the following:      \n      \n>My partner is academically gifted according to her professors but she has some terrible financial habits.\n          \nImmediately comes across to me as \"she's *supposedly* smart according to these other people but *I'm* Mr. Finance\". It seems like you brought up financials because you wanted to give unsolicited advice, and you don't like the direction it went.", "dude, we did this over at r/relationships a couple of days back\n\nYou already didn't respect her much. Now you really don't respect her. (You were also rudely dismissive of her issues with her career regret.)\n\nWalk away.\n\n\nAnd yes YTA for bullying her into a career she clearly doesn't want.", "YTA simply for dismissing her frustrations. I am a registered nurse and I, too, am frustrated regularly with long hours, rude and disrespectful patients, unreasonable patient requests/demands, patients believing THEY are the ONLY patient and THEY are far worse than anyone else and THEY deserve all your time and attention. Being on call sucks; can\u2019t plan anything for the day.\n\nAnd please, you compare a random 12-hour day to her regular 12+ hour days?! Have you no idea how emotionally, mentally, and PHYSICALLY exhausting her job is?! \n\nI, as a part time no-one RN (compared to her education and responsibilities) have more compassion for her and her feelings than you do as her partner?! \n\nDo her a favor and let her go find someone who will at the very least give her a hug after a long, hard day instead of tell her to just power through and call her selfish when she decides maybe this isn\u2019t the right path for her.", "Being a doctor and completing the training is TOUGH. I've got 2 years left before being \"finished\", but the studing never actually ends. \n\nFrom what you said, I think in all honesty, she probably just needs a break. A year out doing something else ususally sends doctors straight back to medicine. It also sounds like she wants a job, but not studying again will mean that it probably won't we that well paid. \n\nIf you are interested in being with her in the long run, taking time away from medicine would be best (but I definatly recommend she finish the 3 months!). If she doesn't find another job and does expect you to just pay for everything, that would be a red flag, but if I understand you correctly, that's not what's happening here. There would just be a large wage gap? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNAH", "YTA -  she has no interest. full stop.  Why would anyone want put their life through hell minimum of 6 years for something that they have no passion for. She probably had a preview of what her life would be and questioning if it's all worth it and if this something that she wants to do for the rest of her life.   \n\n\nMedicine is not for the faint hearted. Medical school actually the easiest part of the journey. The training programme for majority of the colleague is brutal.   \n\\- First, need to build a CV : doing research (out of working hours), lots of extra OT which usually unpaid in order to get good reference from the boss. This is just for the application itself. some people take years to get into the program  \n\\-  once accepted, that's where the hard part begun. Surgical specialty is famous for making their junior doctors and trainee do extra hours (unpaid). turning up at 6.30am (when officially rostered at 7.30) and home time way past rostered hours. you might be on-call for 7, 14 or 21 days straight as registrar on top of working \"normal\" hours during the day.  \n\\- some boss \"expect\" you to assist them in their private list at a private hospital in the name mentoring/training. i called it power abuse. \n\n\\- While working these crazy hours, these trainee also expected to study for their primary exam and fellowship. These trainee significant other (if any) will testify that their SO basically disappear from their life a good 1-2 years during the study period. If has kids, the partner basically took all the caring and responsibility.\n\nit's not something that a person just to get past. If a person clearly love the work, it might be something considered rite of passage. You have to really love that part of medicine that made you want to turn up to work to face with rude patient, rude family, hospital politics, , managing sick patient that is out of your depth with no support from seniors, the endless paperwork, the endless long list of patient.   \n\n\nIt's not all bad. If the department is a good fit, provide good support to juniors, shoe you away when your shift technically finish to go home and enjoy life, everything else just fade away.  For me, Looking after critically unwell patient is where i found the \"joy\". I can't do want the surgeon, nor what obstetrician colleagues nor a psychiatrist... but i can hopefully do my best in supporting these unwell patient until either got better or nature that it takes. All the machines in the world cant save the inevitable.", "YTA, but this is really just a wealth gap thing.\n\nYou need to go find someone else who's inheriting a hedge fund from their daddy.  It doesn't sound as if regular career and work problems are very meaningful to you and you clearly think less of her for it.", "ESH - I\u2019m an RN who works on a surgical unit. If your gf already hates being a surgeon and she isn\u2019t even one yet, she\u2019s going to have a long, miserable career.", ">She has occasionally expressed her disdain for the long hours, rude patients, night shifts, being on-call etc. I told her that it comes with the territory and it's something she has just got to get past.

It is not fair of your gf to just expect you to pay for everything, even if you could, doesn't mean that you should. That being said, you are being super dismissive of her and her feelings. It kinda sounds like she really doesn't like being a doctor that much.\nBeing a doctor is its own thing and even though you are good in the studies, it doesn't necessarily mean that you'll make a good doctor, or that you can handle the pressures and demands. You do long hours too? Okay, cool, are you also responsible for human lifes during those hours? Bc it adds to the pressure, it is not just the hours, but the responsibility. \nThe reality of being a doctor is much less sexy than one might think, and it seems that she is really questioning her career choices, and you being \"suck it up and deal with it\" isn't helping. It is not your responsibility to pay stuff until she figures herself out, but you also shouldn't be an asshole.", "YTA. A surgeon is no easy career. If she doesn\u2019t want to do it, she shouldn\u2019t do it. And that\u2019s the end of that.", "Yta, if that's not what she wants to do with her life, that's her choice, not yours. Also, hopefully, she'll decide to ditch you as well. That way, she won't have to worry about what seems to be two major sources of stress/unhappiness in her life.", "Yta \n\n1) the title is Terrible. It sounds as if you want her to be this way. \n\n2) she doesn't like it. She expressed her DISDAIN for the field. \n\n3) did you guys talk about other jobs she could have outside medical fields.", "YTA for insisting she complete a grueling residency. You don't get to determine her career. If she wants to quit, that's her business. However, you're NTA for not wanting to support her financially just because you can.", "So... you're mad that your partner would have an easier life, why exactly? Assuming you like her, you'd want to make things better for her. Your only advice to her struggles is to ''toughen up''?\n\nSure, the financial responsibility shouldn't be on one person, but it's not really like you worked on yours either. Sounds like the issue is more on you lacking understanding and support for her (which isn't just monetary), which you glossed over.", "YTA.\n\nYour father owns a hedge fund that you will inherit and you work at a parasite private equity firm...which he obviously used his connections and influence to get you that job.\n\nGet out of here with claiming you work 12 hour days too. You don't even do 12 hours a week. Golfing and multiple hour lunches followed with dicking around in an office doing nothing isn't work.", "NTA. But it sounds like she could be burnt-out and very tired. So while NTA for encouraging your girlfriend to continue her education and career, perhaps you could look at her situation from this perspective, and look for ways to help her?", "You\u2019re not the AH for not wanting to financially support her, but you shouldn\u2019t be pushing her into a career that she clearly doesn\u2019t want. The medical field is HARD, it is not a field anyone should enter if their heart isn\u2019t in it. The only outcome to pushing her to be a surgeon when she clearly doesn\u2019t want it is resentment and misery. I do think that she should finish residency since she\u2019s so close to finishing in the first place, but I think that she deserves some time to figure out what she wants to do instead. If you love and respect your girlfriend, you should let her make the decision based on what\u2019s best for her, and if you don\u2019t think you can deal with her decision there is nothing forcing you to stay with her.", "ESH. If she already disdain being in the field in general, wasting 6 more years of time and money to confirm what she'd already decided she hated it is a stupid idea, you shouldn't force your opinion on her. And her expecting you to support her is a deal breaker level entitlement.", "YTA you've been handed a career that will never EVER be as difficult as hers. A finance job that daddy handed you is not even remotely close to a surgeon.  You disregard her feelings because you feel a certain way and then encourage her to follow a career that she's voiced concerns over?\n\nIt sounds like you want her to be a doctor because it fits your idea of what your partner should be", "NTA. There's no guarantee you'll stay together. She needs to be financially independent of you. If you eventually break up and her career is sidelined, she'll blame you. She may even try to make you pay financially. I'd avoid getting into that sticky arrangement. Now you know to never show anyone how much you're worth unless you're getting married.", "Or, just hear me out, she is in a full blown burn out. Talk to her! Ask what is really going on. It's not like she worked so many years just to trick a man to become SAHM", "YTA - your entire life was boosted by daddys money, you are not a self made man. Your gf, whom you dont seem to like all that much, had put herself thru academic hell to become a doctor. You wouldnt even be able to handle an 1/8th of what shes had to deal with.", "ESH- If she doesn\u2019t enjoy the work, the solution isn\u2019t too push through. That said, you are not interested in being the breadwinner. She shouldn\u2019t expect you to just finance her fully.", "NAH\n\nI'm going to go with kindness and say no assholes here. Your girlfriend clearly isn't lazy, she must be smart, and driven, and motivated and disciplined to complete what is currently 9 years of a medical track - to want to quit 3 months away from completing her residency. I feel like something serious is going on here with her, and she deserves to have the freedom to choose what the rest of her life will look like. If this track isn't for her, you shouldn't be forcing her to complete it. You should be sitting here down and t alking to her openly and honestly about why she wants to switch and what career she wants for the rest of her life. \n\nEqually if you do not want to be a single earner household and you want to have two earning adults (and in the future, have you discussed children or what the home will look like after children?) then you should not have to be the one to support her if this isn't something you both agree on. It's not wrong to tell her to get a job and that you won't support her, but it is wrong to make her feel pushed in a specific direction if that's causing serious burnout and issues for her. But you need to be clear that you don't see a future where you are financially supporting your partner permanently.\n\nI feel like she latched on to you supporting her not because she doesn't want to work - 9 years of med school has shown she's willing to put work into something - but because she's probably on the edge, or in the middle of a mental breakdown, and she's feeling desperate and burned out.", "NTA. You're encouraging her to complete her residency. It's unfair of her to expect you to be financially responsible for both of you. \n\nThat being said if she really is still unhappy after her residency is complete then maybe help her look elsewhere. Not everyone is cut out for that kind of job. No matter how academically gifted they may be.", "NAH\n\nI can see why you dont want to be a meal ticket.\n\nYour gf is looking at at least another 6 years of study meaning she will be 35, give it a few years of practice and that motherhood missed.  (Yea I know women can have babies late 30s/40s but its not recommended)\n\nOP what do you want?  Do you want a family, kids, a wife at home looking after them?   You are 30s now, do you want to wait until your late 30s/40s? \n\nIf you can afford it, love this woman and think she is a keeper, then sit down and have a long think.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and have not talked in three days.\" . but THAT relationship is over.", "NTA for not agreeing to financially support her. YTA for ignoring her real misgivings about her chosen career.\n\nYour GF should pursue a career that is rewarding to her personally, not just financially. It's okay if you, as her partner, earn more and hence contribute more to your future home's finances. Relationships are never cut and dry equal. \n\nBUT, it is perfectly fair for you to resist her attempt to mentally check out of her residency program just because she has a rich BF. It puts HER in a very dangerous situation. She needs to plan her alternate career path without the crutch of a potentially rich spouse.", "If she doesn't want this career that is ok, don't tell her she needs to. I also hated my career and my wife was very supportive with me and my career change. BUT your gf wants to quit doing anything. She wants to be your wife and that's it. Big red flag in my book.", "NTA, and I'm shocked your gf is willing to throw away her education and whatever money invested into it to date :(", "NTA.\n\nShe saw your money and has seen her way to a free ride. Which she pretty much admits when she says 'you have enough for both'. This isn't about her job at all.\n\nTell her if she is truly unhappy as a resident you fully support her changing careers but you are not going to be the one paying for everything. She needs to earn her way.\n\nMy guess? She'll blow up and it will be evident extremely fast that it's not about her job. She just doesn't want to work.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t tell her to be a surgeon. You encouraged her to finish something that she\u2019s been working towards for about a decade. It does seem bizarre that she wants to up and quit this after finding out how much money you have in your portfolio. However, she may be feeling trapped since she does have so much invested towards this and lacks the financial stability to bail. I think she should finish up the last 3 months of residency and then take a break to think about what the next best move for her might be. Is there a way she can pivot without wasting all the work she\u2019s done so far? It\u2019s worth exploring, but you should make it very clear if you are not interested in supporting her financially long term. Make sure you both have realistic expectations going forward, especially regarding the timeline for marriage, children and careers.", "NTA\n\nA year and a half together isn\u2019t terribly long. It\u2019s not long enough to think \u201cthis man needs to support me for the rest of our lives.\u201d Just because he has the money. She intended to finish studying before she saw what your finances looked like. It\u2019s so alien to me that a person would see that and just think \u201cwow now I don\u2019t have to work again.\u201d \n\nYour wife needs to be able to stand on her own two feet financially, and even if you help her set up her finances so they\u2019re working well for her, I\u2019d say it\u2019s absolutely best that you keep your finances seperate. Though you seem to already know that\u2019s best. \n\nMake it clear to her that she needs to have her own finances and her own way to earn. If she can\u2019t find another way to earn an income she can contribute to your lifestyle equally with, she needs to finish studying. That\u2019s not an unreasonable expectation considering that would have been her plan before finding out her boyfriend is loaded.", "You\u2019re lucky that this came out before you got married. I\u2019d run. She\u2019s going to pull this again when you\u2019re legally and financially tied to her and you can lose a lot in alimony.", "YTA \n\nIt might be a great idea for her to find some way to endure the last time of recidency, especially since she only has 3 months left. \n\nBut that is not accomplished by telling her to toughen up, or berating her for wanting to switch careers. I don\u2019t know how much is differed from the way it works here in Sweden, but when you\u2019re done with recidency you get a pay bump, that would carry over (at least to some degree) if she chooses to change direction and go into another field. \n\nA more constructive way to handle this situation is to try to evaluate the mental state of your partner - physician burnout is common and very tough. Try to find out what she likes and dislikes about medicine, and try to figure out which other specialty would appeal more to her. For her, planning to switch specialty might be the light at end of the tunnel that she so desperately seem to need. Knowing that there is a positive plan in place might make it easier to endure the last 3 months of her recidency.", "First of all, your title is misleading. You did not tell her to become a surgeon. You told her to finish her residency, which is 3 more months, not 6 years. Big difference! \n\nNTA for basically not wanting to carry both of you financially and honestly start thinking about that prenup if you consider marriage. \nShe clearly feels entitled to everything you have even though it has nothing to do with her that you have what you have. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want to become a surgeon, that\u2019s fine. She has some wiggle room. She could go into research, she could find another field etc.\n\nMaybe leave it up to her how long she can take off after completing her residency. But start having some financial boundaries. Who pays for what, what each person\u2019s obligations are etc and stick to them.", "NTA\n\nIt nearly sounds as though she did medicine because of her good marks rather than having a passion for it.  Why did it take 6 years to do the Dr of Medicine?  Did she go part time or are you including the 1-2 years of being a HMO as part of it as required for registration.  And was there a particular reason she didn't do undergrad medicine?  The interview has a big part to play in getting a spot.  They want to see the passion rather than just the fact you got a 99.95 ATAR.\n\nThere's also no guarantee that she'll be accepted into the Surgeon training either.\n\nWhat's your girlfriend's passion?  Is it something she can turn into a career?\n\nI would also possibly question whether she should take a long hard look at whether ADHD should be a consideration and an assessment and probably medication be in order.  It's often missed in bright girls and they can do very well in school and have university degrees but they just lose their passion and lose interest.  Even how you describe her financial situation sounds very impulsive and very much could fit into ADHD.  It's a brain chemical imbalance.  Gold standard to 'fix it' is medication (is the most effective thing to treat and has the most impact) but you also need strategies to help the executive function and impulsiveness.  Sometimes things look fine from the outside because of a few decades of learning strategies but inside you are floundering and actually have low self esteem and feel like a failure even though everyone thinks you are a success.\n\nDespite all the study she's done so far, medicine really may not be for her.  Esp if she hates it.\n\nBut would she consider a different speciality such as dermatology?  Office hours mainly.  Unless your girlfriend wants to work on her own (or a very small team of people she likes), or with plants or animals.... she's going to come across rude and entitled people.  But can avoid the long hours and the night shift.\n\nI do think there is more going on with your girlfriend even if you can't understand it when she looks like she has/had it all together.\n\nI wouldn't immediately think that she's lazy and just wants to live off your money.  She'd actually get bored and want to do more anyway.  But this may have been seen as a means to get away from doing something she didn't want to do any more.\n\nThe worst part is that she may not be able to articulate it to you... esp if she really does have ADHD.", "NTA. This is a major red flag. I can't imagine being this entitled. If someone just flat out decided that they were entitled to my money like that it would be a deal breaker. I would run so fast. \n\n My wife is a doctor and yes the hours are long and the work can be hard. Seems like she's already made up her mind and she's not going to go back to school. \n\nIf I were you I'd run now. She wants a sugar daddy. It's good that she showed you her true colors now instead of after you got married.", "NTA\nIn my opinion, she seems like she didn\u2019t want to be a doctor to begin with\u2026 maybe she did not think it through when she applied and only now sees the pros and cons. She definitely lacks some financial education skills. It is surprising to see how close she is to completing her residency though, but she sounds very burnt out. \nIt is unfair for her to demand you fully support her when she is perfectly capable to work. So yeah, NTA", "Tentative NTA as I think it's the right call to encourage her to complete her residency and not become financially dependent on you. \n\nThat being said, if she really is unhappy once those three months are up you should support her looking elsewhere. You will inherit a job that will never be as difficult as hers currently is. With her medical degree she could transition into a less stressful job which may be better for her mental health.", "NTA. If she isn't happy I agree she shouldn't be a surgeon; she likely won't be one of the best ones if she resents having to do the job. However, with her degrees and skillset there a lots of jobs she could do outwith surgery; until she's worked out what she wants to do, she has a responsibility to keep earning. Expecting you to be solely responsible for both of you, knowing she doesn't make the best financial choices, isn't on.", "YTA Nepobaby hypocrite.", "NTA. You showed her a goldmine and she showed you she is a gold digger. \n\nThis is not the women for you. Financial responsibility is obviously important to you, she is not. That\u2019s sounds like you are incompatible.", "It makes sense that she finish her residency because it\u2019s only 3 months more. But if she\u2019s doing it, and if she completes it then she could easily find something else to do with that education and training that doesn\u2019t involve becoming a surgeon that would still pay very well. \n\nShe could do a bunch of stuff without a residency\u2026  medical research scientist, health insurance consultant, medical services management, instructor\u2026 there\u2019s like 100s of things she could still do that pay extremely well. Most of those start in the 100k range starting salary. \n\nMaybe you could talk about that, and look at options and help her get on her path and let her know what your financial expectations are going to be in a long term relationship. \n\nIf she isn\u2019t passionate about becoming a surgeon then I can see how 6 more years can feel hopeless. There so many other things she could do..", "She\u2019s already sunk nearly 10 years into this and wants to quit now?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not so much about the money but more just that she\u2019s burning out?

Everything has been great for the most part. We have been talking about marriage, moving in together, having children and all that for around 2 months.\n\nI work in a private equity firm and I will take over my dad's hedge fund when he retires in around 10 years. My girl is studying medicine to become a surgeon; she is currently completing her residency. She has occasionally expressed her disdain for the long hours, rude patients, night shifts, being on-call etc. I told her that it comes with the territory and it's something she has just got to get past. I don't like when I have 12+ hour days but it is what it is.\n\nMy partner is academically gifted according to her professors but she has some terrible financial habits. She spends most of what she earns, barely saves anything and doesn't make any investments. In an effort to get her to be more 'money-savvy', I decided to teach her about financial discipline and investing. To do this, I showed her my own investment portfolio (which I have never shown anyone aside from my parents) to illustrate my progress throughout the years and how she could do something similar with her own money.\n\nHowever, this took an unexpected turn. We started talking about our individual finances. I told her about my dad's company and investments and she told me about her parents restaurant business which barely breaks even. We had a discussion about this for over 2 weeks and she asked me if she could quit her residency. She had always complained about work like anyone would about their 9-5 but I never thought she would want to quit entirely. When I asked why, she said that she wasn't particularly fond of the work and that I have enough money to take care of us both. I told her that it would be unfair to place the entire financial burden on me to which she said that I could easily afford it so it shouldn't matter. She said that she would find something to do but she doesn't want to study again.\n\nI don't like how she suddenly switched up and wants to quit. It seems incredibly unfair how she can just drop her entire career just because I can afford a nice lifestyle for the both of us. I told her that she could maybe take a break for a week after completing her residency to think about it but she wanted to quit then and there. I told her that she had to toughen up and get through atleast the residency but she got mad and told me I wasn't being understanding enough. We ended up getting into a huge fight and have not talked in three days.\n\nSome history: She studied bio-med initially for 3 years, then did her Doctor of medicine which was 6 years. Then, she started her residency which she will be completing in 3 months. Afterwards, her plan was to apply for the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons\u2019 Surgical Training program which is another 6 years to finish.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Could she be a general family medicine doctor or something more 9-5 with her degree ?", "I'm not trying to curse you or anything. \n\nHer abandoning her career is a horrible idea. What if you guys break up after she has already left for too long and cannot resume? And you guys never married and never had any kids. She'd be screwed as an unemployed person.\n\nThere is no such thing as the disney prince that will magically solve all her problems. She needs to be capable of being financially independent. Even if it means pursuing a different career from surgeon. It's extremely unfair to place all the financial burden on one person in the relationship.\n\nLet's say you both agree to do it and become the sole breadwinner. You already said she is the kind of person who spends all their money. She will not be happy with being unable to spend money as she likes since it's all earned by you.", "NAH. Encourage her to suck it up for the three months remaining of her residency so she didn\u2019t just waste the last almost 10 years of her life. Without a completed residency, her job prospects being a doctor will disappear. After she completes the small amount of time left, encourage her to do what she wants with her career. She doesn\u2019t have to be a surgeon. She can still be a doctor in another field of medicine and start her career instead of taking on another residency.", "Nta. She now sees you as a bank, and if she ends up quitting for real, you might want to reconsider your relationship. It\u2019s okay for her to dislike what she\u2019s doing, but it is not okay to blatantly tell you that \"you can just pay for everything\"", "NTA she is a gold digger! It\u2019s not ok for her to expect you to support her financially!", "Definitely slow down on the marriage talk. If she wants to take some time to figure out what she wants to do, that's on her.

That isn't going to suddenly approve when she gets access to yours.", "NTA You aren't engaged and you haven't been together all that long. It's fair if you don't want to support her financially. If you are going to get married, you have to have a serious talk about finances. It's fair not to want to be the sole earner in a relationship, that's a lot of responsibility.  If she's switching careers that's one thing but to just quit this far in without a plan is pretty irresponsible and not fair to you.", "In another post you said she\u2019s trying to be a GP and now it\u2019s a surgeon? Which is it? Because it\u2019s completely different training paths. If she wants to be a surgeon but hates the long hours, etc etc, maybe going into private surgery when she\u2019s done her residency may be the way to go? \n\nOr, maybe a different route of medicine that routinely works Monday to Friday etc that she may enjoy? Instead of brushing it under the rug, sit down and talk about different avenues she can go down with medicine and see if those are options she\u2019d be interested in. \n\nBut I\u2019ll say ESH. Sounds like you\u2019re not being supportive enough of her career doubts but it\u2019s not up to you to financially support her either and she\u2019s quite entitled to think you should.", "ESH", "NTA. One partner stopping working simply because the other can afford is it NOT a unilateral decision to make.\n\nAnd it's just 3 more months anyways, at least finish that.\n\nShe can't just stop working/earning and expect you to finance everything on the promise of \"I'll find something\".\n\nApart from all that, she's probably accostumed to a certain lifestyle if she blows all her money all the time. If that will be downsized to fit your budget (and only if you agree to this which I wouldn't) what is she gonna expect then?

He has a do nothing job that his dad gave him in finance. He's not carrying himself financially. It's daddy that really pays his bills.", "i found it weird the word residency being used. Anyone who not a registrar or intern or consultant is called a resident. Quitting in the middle of internship does have a major impact as the person will not be able to obtain general registration.\n\nA resident who decide to quit 3 months prior to end of contract is not necessarily doing a career-ending move. You definitely burn the bridges with medical workforce though. Australia medical work system only offer one year contract to junior doctors. (The system for doctor in training program is different). Moving back to resident, contract usually starts in jan/feb.  process for job application for next year usually start from May and concluded by September. By October, pretty much everyone know they will be doing next year.\n\nQuestion is Does OP's gf has a job line after her official contract finish. Does her contract is somewhere else she can leave burn the bridge with leaving no possibility of coming back in near future. unless as a consultant", "Agree. The life of a surgeon can be grinding, but maybe there\u2019s another specialty she\u2019d like better. It\u2019s not too late for her to find something else in medicine that she might be better suited for. Life is too short to be miserable at your work if you have other options.", "This is more   likely about having a way to escape the pressure.    \nAustralian residency is brutal with  mental health consequences   for  many but seeking help is difficult.      \n\nThis is a brilliant person   who will have plenty of career options and is a hard worker who has got through very difficult degrees. It is unlikely to be about the money here.\n\nAustralia has a social safety net,  so things are very different here.", "residency in australia is basically a position between an intern and registrar. Generally it's only two years of residency before moving on to become a registrar. In Australian medical, residence is still considered baby doctor where they are only part of a stream (general/surgical/physician/critical) that rotated through different rotation throughout the year.\n\nThey are not given the main responsibility of being in charge of patient management on the ward where the responsibility fall to the registrar who is already part of training program or have the same skill level expected for a registrar.\n\nShe does sound like she is facing burn out especially with difficult two years we had with covid.", "She was with him long before she understood his investments. Calling her a gold digger doesn't make sense. She has been miserable with her career for a long time and got excited about the idea that she could be free. Clearly, she can't, and bf doesn't wish to support her while she figures out her mental health and personal needs. That is fine. She is an adult and can figure it out on her own. \nThat does kind of solidify the not being a team thing. So, I don't see this relationship lasting. She will always see him and someone who can't be relied on, and he will see her as less if she doesn't become a surgeon. They aren't compatible, but I wouldn't call anyone TA or a gold digger.", "I think this is a stretch. Sounds like she's been unhappy in her field for a while, long before she learned of his financial position. They live together so that implies a certain level of investment in their future. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask a life partner to take on a larger financial responsibility whilst the other person either takes a break or retrains.", "Of course it's a red flag, she's probably drowinging with her responsibilities, realizing that all those studies and hard work doesn't bring her the fulfillment she was expecting. Maybe there's pressure from her family and friends and definetly from Bf. \nDo you really believe, that a golddigger would spend 6+ years studying such hard subjects just to get a man from finance field and do nothing? Now that's a confusing road to follow. \n\nShe probably needs so time out and professional help to deal with her mental load.", "Yeah it really came off to me as OP expecting the conversation to be like \"here is an example of investing, now let's talk about your finances\" without any focus on the disparity in income and her having not known or fully realized that before.

The hours she's working as a surgical resident likely don't leave her any time to plan or decide what she'd rather do. Needing some time/breathing room to figure that out would be reasonable, but announcing that she wants to quit and just *not do anything else* is certainly unreasonable. \n\n>She made this choice at the drop of a hat as soon as she saw how much money he had. That's concerning.\n\nAgain, I'd say that's not a totally fair interpretation. Sticking with a job you hate because you genuinely need the money makes sense. That's what most people have to do their whole lives. If your partner who claims to love and care about you has the means to help you out of that situation, then they'd need a pretty compelling reason not to do so. As I said, it's fair to prefer a partner who has a job of some kind, but insisting they stick it out at a job they hate when they don't have to is really shitty. \n\n>The stress she's talking about. Getting through it is part of the residency. People have career regrets all the time in that kind of situation.\n\nHonestly this take is very patronizing. OP says that she's consistently complained about various aspects of her job and said she's not attached to the work. Why shouldn't we take her at her word rather than assuming she's \"just stressed out\" or somehow doesn't know her own mind?\n\n>If this person wasn't well off for life and his partner was quitting a career they invested in everyone would be up in arms for her expecting him to carry her on his back while she figured something new out\n\nVery true, but that is simply not their situation. It would not place undue financial hardship on OP to pick up some of the slack while she figures something else out. Insisting that she *must* be a surgeon when they do not require a surgeon's paycheck to maintain their lifestyle is ridiculous. \n\nEven so, I *still* would have said N T A in light of the fact that his gf seems to not want to work at all, indefinitely (or at least OP implied as much). I acknowledge there are issues with the gf's approach here (as it's been presented by OP anyway), but you're ignoring the very concerning language OP uses which reeks of a seriously controlling attitude.

I'm guessing this means you're in the <1%. She's been in school her whole life, likely accumulating debt, and her parents barely scrape by. So, she came up lower-middle class. You just showed her an amount of money she likely has no realistic way to understand.\n\n2) As a resident, she likely makes only about as much as she needs to live, but you're scolding her about savings. There is likely no catching up with you, given her starting point compared to yours, for at least decades. And putting away $500/month or something right now is going to feel meaningless. High paying surgeons can make $500K/year (at least in the US, not sure about UK), but as you can tell, that's still 6 years away, and she'll likely have some significant debt to pay off. So, while you might know a thing or two about equity markets, it really sounds like you are not coming at this from a 'financial advisor' perspective as you are not considering her specific situation.\n\n3) She probably feels pretty demoralized.

Don\u2019t tell anyone else ever again.", "ESH.\n\nYou for your attitude and her for thinking it's okay to throw away her career and need to work for a free meal ticket just because your showed your wealth. \n\nYou are correct to not pay for her lifestyle if she quits, but try to discuss other options. She's clearly extremely exhausted and stressed with what is considered a challenging career and residency. She could probably use more support.", "Nta. She never brought up how she felt about her residency until after seeing her partner\u2019s portfolio.\n\nI would def voted otherwise if this topic was something OP girlfriend has been expressing the past year. \n\nAlso if this is how she acts when something gets rough\u2026 what does that mean for the future?", "NTA and I don\u2019t understand anyone saying he is. Just because he has the money doesn\u2019t mean he should have to financially support her while she sits around and does nothing. He didn\u2019t make her study medicine she gave into her pushy parents that\u2019s not his fault and even if he did encourage it, that\u2019s not making her do it. Yeah OP had a nice life and cushy job but that\u2019s irrelevant. She wants to just not work and thats lazy and the entitlement to Judy come to him having decided she\u2019s quitting and that he\u2019ll just support her. Wow!", "ESH. If she wants to quit a field she has lost interest in that is her decision, but she's TA for expecting you to financially support her. Honestly, her level of entitlement for me would mean I would never again feel comfortable merging finances and a marriage would come with an automatic prenup because I'd no longer trust her to not just quit one day and expect me to be \"forced\" into footing the bills.", "YTA, if she doesn't want to be a surgeon, then she doesn't have to be. You can respectfully give your opinion, but you can't force her to if she doesn't want to.\n\nHowever, if you don't want to fund her lifestyle or don't want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't work or study, then that's your decision to make.", "For the record, her parents never wanted her to do medicine, she pursued it herself. I find it crazy that she chased this profession for about a decade now out of high school and wants to quit. I understand doing something for a year or two, realising it's not for you and quitting but this is another level. \n\nYeah I suppose it was wrong for me to tell her to toughen up. I might try to be more understanding.", "She complained about being unable to save on a $90k salary which should not be happening. I told her that her expenses will always catch up to or exceed her income if she is not financially disciplined, even if she earned $10 million a year. I helped her because she needed financial advice, not because I'm 'Mr Finance'. She was legitimately struggling to save money and have passive income.", "I get your point but why should he take full financial responsibility for her. He shouldnt be seen as a free ride.", "I think he has some points, like how he shouldn't have to pay for both of their lives forever, but he's just such an AH about it. If he's serious about marrying this woman, then her happiness should be important to him. So rather than pushing her into medicine, maybe the middle ground would be supporting her until she figures out what she wants to do - become a different type of doctor or use her medical knowledge in other ways, do an office job, take over her parents' restaurant..... there's so many options beyond \"stay in a career you hate\" and \"never work again\".", "My dad made it out of the slums. A rags to riches story if you will. Since he made it up the ranks by himself, he wanted me to do the same. He never helped me even with internships and graduate programs leading out of university. He always told me that if I couldn't become someone without his help, I wouldn't deserve to run his company. He agreed to hand over the reigns to me recently because of my CFA charter and my success as a senior associate. Even so, I don't believe my job is as hard as being a surgeon or any job in the health field.\n\nI don't necessarily want her to be a surgeon, I want her to at least finish her residency which is only another 3 months.

If she took all the at home responsibility maybe but no maid because that would be paid for by him not her and if they have a lot of money they probably have a large house so that's a lot of work just like if you were a doctor except your home is your job. If that is an okay exception meaning very traditional relationship then good do that but if she expects him to pay for everything and get nothing in return then no she's the AH.

I can appreciate feeling overwhelmed, absolutely! But I've never asked anyone, \"Hey, you make enough money. Can you just take care of me and I not bring in any cash? That will be alright, right, because you make enough to take care of us both?\" That's not cool. We would be appalled if it was a man asking a woman that. \n\nShe _should_ be tired of school. She's been doing it for a long time. But if she quit, what about all the student loans she's had to have taken out? When doctors are going to school, they go into hundreds of thousands in debt just to get through school. So she's asking her boyfriend to pay for her debt _and_ her lifestyle because she's overwhelmed? They're not even living together, engaged, or married. Is she trying to drive him away?", ">If she was just starting her residency I would agree.\n\nI think you have this backwards. If she was just starting I'd say that she she give it some time to fully assess whether it's a good fit rather than being overwhelmed by the initial wave of stress. \n\n>She has 3 months left in a 3 year residency program. \n\nI actually agree with this somewhat. 3 months is not a long time to power through and have a complete credential in case she changes her mind again. \n\n>You can't take a gap year after a residency. This stuff is competitive.\n\nThis actually contradicts your previous point. If taking a year off will thoroughly destroy her progress, then why bother finishing the residency at all? \n\n>People have second thoughts all the time. \n\nThe fact that many people have second thoughts is not evidence that surgery is the right career for her. \n\nAll of these arguments basically boil down to a sunk-cost fallacy: she's come so far, she can't stop now! She shouldn't even take time off, it's too competitive! Second thoughts are normal, so her feelings aren't valid!\n\n>She doesn't have to be a surgeon. But she doesn't get to lay back and do nothing either if he doesn't want that kind of relationship.\n\nI never said she should get to lay back and do nothing. Believe it or not there are many other options in life that are neither \"doing nothing\" nor \" being a surgeon\". Either way it's not up to OP to dictate her choices. It's only up to him whether he wants to continue the relationship.\n\nETA:\n\n>if you read the text he said that she can take time to think about it and that he's open to her changing paths rather than force her down surgery.\n\nHe literally offered her *one week* to think about it. That is not a reasonable timeframe to determine whether to commit to a very demanding career nor to come up with a fully fleshed-out alternative. And where exactly does he say that he'd be open to her pursuing a different path? I don't see that anywhere in the post. \n\n\n>You don't get to drop out of a 3 year residency with 3 months left after 3 years of premed because your partner has money.\n\nUmm, you *get* to drop out of a residency for literally any reason.  It's not indentured servitude. Whether or not her partner supports her financially is a separate question. I've never said that OP should be ok with taking on 100% of the financial burden, but he doesn't get to dictate her career choices either.", ">He literally offered her one week to think about it. That is not a reasonable timeframe... \n\nI mean, it's a lot more reasonable than her idea, which was to just quit and mooch off OP, lol.", "So I think the point you're kinda missing is the implied \"if you want to keep the relationship and have a job\"\n\nIt's not a \"sunk cost fallacy\" in this case. It's a sunk cost. Life isn't going to always be kind to you. \n\nShe made decisions. Adult decisions. She has a 3 year biochem degree. Those are useless as a bachelor's without post-secondary education. \n\nShe has a 6 year med degree. Which is only there so she can get a residency. \n\nWithout her residency she doesn't have a career. She's back at square 1. She will need a lot of support to get back on track if she does change tracks.\n\nShe does not get to make these decisions unilaterally in a relationship. He's allowed to say \"no, I didn't sign up for you setting yourself back 9 years career wise\". He's allowed to say \"no, I want to marry a driven career woman. I fell in love with the woman that wanted to be a surgeon, not the one that quits because it's hard as soon as she finds out that her partner has money\". \n\nThis isn't \"oh we've both been working and saving and I'm not happy with my career and need a change. We have the savings to take this on\" it's \"YOU have the savings to take this on and I want you to use them\" and he's allowed to say \"no\". \n\nAlso it's not one week. It's 3 months and one week. That's plenty of time to figure out what she wants to do after the residency and get a clear plan. Is she tired after the residency work? Probably. Is it going to be extra work and stress? Yes. Welcome to the real world. It's not going to do you any favors and her issue is that she's presumptive. \n\nThis is the path SHE chose. It's hard, and stressful, and lucrative for a reason. Is it shitty that she doesn't get to take a year off to figure things out? \n\nShe does not get to use his money as an excuse to give up when shit gets hard. She can give up, that's her prerogative, but it's not the kind of decision you make in a committed relationship unilaterally.\n\nYou don't get to give up without a plan and just implicitly expect the other person to give up the slack. Under any circumstances. That's just not OK. You can give up and lose the relationship, or you can take advantage of their love for you and do it anyway, but that would especially make you TA.\n\nHer feelings are valid. But reality doesn't care about your feelings and sometimes people need to accept that.", "Why does that bother you so much?", ">It\u2019s a white lie dear, not that hard to understand\n\nWhy would a man who deals with the practicalities of finance think she's telling a white lie? Why would a man who has seen her not manage her money well think she's telling a white lie? Why would a man who's seen that she's getting burned out and frustrated think she's telling a white lie? Why didn't this woman ask for this type of motivation before she saw how much money he had, so why would he think her asking now was a white lie?\n\nIt seems to me it's very hard to see how it's a white lie.", "I feel like this is being glossed over:\n\n>She said that she would find something to do but she doesn't want to study again.\n\nOP is doing his best to give the impression that she just wants to be a trophy wife, but that's not entirely true. Not wanting to study again is not the same thing as never wanting to work again. Not earning a surgeon's salary is not the same as not contributing.", "> She does not get to make these decisions unilaterally in a relationship. He's allowed to say \"no, I didn't sign up for you setting yourself back 9 years career wise\". He's allowed to say \"no, I want to marry a driven career woman. I fell in love with the woman that wanted to be a surgeon, not the one that quits because it's hard as soon as she finds out that her partner has money\".\n\nI agree with all of this. But these are arguments for him to break up with her, not to demand that she continue down this path. \n\n>Also it's not one week. It's 3 months and one week. That's plenty of time\n\nThis is disingenuous. Surgical residency is grueling and does not leave her with adequate time to do this kind of introspection and planning during those 3 months.\n\nAlso, I asked in my previous comment, but where in the post does OP say he'd be fine with her changing careers even if she did come up with an adequate plan? I don't see that anywhere. \n\n>You don't get to give up without a plan and just implicitly expect the other person to give up the slack. Under any circumstances.\n\nAgain, I agree. But as I said this is a reason to end the relationship, not to insist that she *must* be a surgeon. \n\nI also don't think OP has a leg to stand on when it comes to arguments like: \"welcome to the real world\" or \"you can't give up just because it's hard\" when he's literally inheriting Daddy's hedge fund.", "I mean, that doesn't mean it's okay for her to just quit and rely on OP carrying her weight until she does find something.", "> I don't like how she suddenly switched up and wants to quit. It seems incredibly unfair how she can just drop her entire career just because I can afford a nice lifestyle for the both of us. I told her that she could maybe take a break for a week after completing her residency to think about it but she wanted to quit then and there. I told her that she had to toughen up and get through atleast the residency but she got mad and told me I wasn't being understanding enough. We ended up getting into a huge fight and have not talked in three days.\n\nNotice where he said \n\n> I told her that she could maybe take a break for a week after completing her residency to think about it\n\nThat's very clearly him at least being open to discussion. \n\n> I agree with all of this. But these are arguments for him to break up with her, not to demand that she continue down this path.\n\nTwo things: \n\n1. Again the title is much harsher than the reality. People do this sometimes in this subreddit. He's not forcing her to become a surgeon. He's saying \"you don't get to drop your residency because I have money\"\n\n2. Yes. But read between the lines. If you think he would stay with her based on his comments so far if she just dropped the residency on the spot you're missing the point entirely. I've also mentioned later that him staying with her and supporting her anyway is her taking advantage of his love for her. \n\n>This is disingenuous. Surgical residency is grueling and does not leave her with adequate time to do this kind of introspection and planning during those 3 months.\n\nI'm aware of how grueling it is. But my point is that she's making a large and life changing decision at a critical time. It's not supposed to be easy to do. Doing so with the presumption of your recent discovery of your rich partner carrying you through it without discussing it is more shitty. \n\n> I also don't think OP has a leg to stand on when it comes to arguments like: \"welcome to the real world\" or \"you can't give up just because it's hard\" when he's literally inheriting Daddy's hedge fund. \n\nThe guy clearly busts balls. Has regular 12 hour days. Has financial discipline, a work ethic. I'm not going to sit here and pretend he didn't start halfway to the finish line with a silver spoon in his mouth. He learned all this from somewhere. \n\nBut this isn't the case of a spoiled trust fund baby getting daddy's money. It's the case of Daddy giving him a head start and tools and him taking advantage of it and the information. Don't rag on the dude for having money."]}
