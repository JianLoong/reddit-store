{"id": 28709, "submission_id": "175ilu4", "title": "AITA for Refusing to Pay More Rent?", "selftext": "My (24F) husband (25M) and I recently moved back to the state I\u2019m from. My twin sister suggested that we all live together so that she can move out of our parents\u2019 house. At first, we were hesitant. However, we eventually agreed because it would be mutually beneficial. She found the place, a 3-bed at $1295/mo + utilities. When asking about how we would split up the rent + utilities, she said that she would split everything 50/50 with us. This is an agreement we came to a few months ago. \n\n2 weeks ago, we signed the lease + moved in. We agreed that my husband + I would share the larger bedroom, she would get one room, and she + my husband would share the spare room as a home office/gaming room. We were all getting along great until my sister approached me, explaining that after she\u2019s done some thinking, she no longer believes that our original agreement is fair because we make more money than she does. (For context, I make $29k/yr, my husband makes $55k/yr, and my sister makes $45k/yr). She proceeded to suggest that we pay 2/3 rent + utilities and that she pays 1/3.  I was caught off-guard by the conversation. I had to think about what she said and talk to my husband. I didn\u2019t want to argue with her or make her upset, so we negotiated down to us paying $800 while she pays $495 for rent and that we would pay 65% of utilities. I still didn\u2019t feel right about this, but I tried seeing it from her POV. \n\nThe next day, I spoke to my parents + my aunt about it. My parents + aunt both agreed that it was unfair for her to renegotiate now. After speaking with them, I realized that I needed to speak with her again + insist that we go back to our original agreement. I approached her that night saying that I knew we had discussed this, but the more I thought and talked with my husband (who also felt it was unfair), the more I felt it was unfair for her to go back on our original agreement. Before I could finish explaining my first thought, she began to interrupt + argue with me. She got upset and walked away from the conversation, saying that as soon as our lease was up (in 1 yr), she would find somewhere else to live. At this point, I was shocked at how upset and angry she became. I ended up leaving the house for a bit with my husband to chat when I received a call from my parents. \n\nThey explained that my sister had called them crying and yelling, saying that they needed to stay out of our business. She had the sentiment that she had been screwed over and that everyone was against her and taking my side. \n\nFor context, she just bought a new car (not out of necessity, she just wanted a newer one). My dad said that he tried discussing bills with her, but she insisted she could afford it easily. I feel guilty, but my family is telling me that I did the right thing by sticking up for myself. Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: This arrangement was my sister\u2019s idea from the beginning. She offered 50/50 split. If she told me she wanted me to pay more before, I would probably have chosen for my husband and I to live alone.\n\nAnother edit: When I say bigger room, our room is 15x12 ft, hers is 12x12 ft. Also, I am very willing for us to pay 2/3 for utilities and she pay 1/3, so I will speak to her again once she\u2019s willing. This whole thing has been a whirlwind of big feelings and certainly not reflective of our lifelong relationship. We love each other very much, and neither of us would ever purposefully screw each other over.\n\nFinal edit: My sister left for a few days to stay w/ a friend. I texted her saying I was sorry about all this and that I wanted to discuss it further with her and that I loved her, but she simply told me that she didn\u2019t want to speak to me. I was ok with that b/c I know she\u2019s upset with me, but then she proceeded to text again saying something that hurt my feelings quite a bit. We\u2019ve always been so close, and it would be just insane for this to cause our whole relationship to blow up. I\u2019m not going to just stick to my guns to make a point at the expense of our relationship, but she\u2019s also been saying and doing hurtful things that I think are going overboard. This is such a terrible situation tbh and I\u2019m heartbroken about it.", "created_utc": 1697042503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175ilu4/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_more_rent/", "score": 903, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re sister definitely shouldn\u2019t have tried to change the rent agreement after signing the lease nor should she have gotten mad when you said no. With that being said your current rent agreement is definitely not fair because she as an individual person is paying the same amount of rent as two people. You did the math on how much you and your husband would pay together if you split the rent 2/3 and 1/3 but you didn\u2019t think to break it down to show what you each pay individually. Currently you and your husband each pay around $324 in rent whereas your sister pays around $648. If you were to split it into you and your husband paying 2/3s of the rent. That means all three of you would be paying around $432 in rent. Yes for you and your husband it adds up to be over $800 together but if you consider it as your three individuals who all have their own income and are all paying for rent then splitting it into thirds is much more fair than splitting it in half but having two people contribute to one of those halves of rent.", "ESH - Your sister sucks for waiting until AFFTER the lease was signed to try and renegotiate how payment should be split. \n\nBut on the other hand, you suck for \u201cnot feeling right\u201d about splitting things fairly. You and your husband are two people. You take up more space and will ultimately use more utilities.\n\nYou all should have talked more before moving, but you and your husband should definitely be paying 2/3 rent and 2/3 utilities if you really want it to be fair. It has nothing to do with who makes more and everything to do with paying each person\u2019s fair share. You and your husband together are not one person, so you shouldn\u2019t be paying the same as one person.", "Bro your agreement is terribly unfair. You use 2/3rds of the bathroom and pay for half. You use 2/3rds of the fridge space and pay for half. 2/3rds of all the common areas, 2/3rds of the utilities, the only thing you actually \"split\" 50/50 is the bedrooms, and even then yours is larger! \n\n>My parents + aunt both agreed that it was unfair for her to renegotiate now.\n\nI guess, but it's an unreasonable split anyway and you should have seen this coming. Pay for what you use, don't expect your sister to subsidize your rent. \n\n>She had the sentiment that she had been screwed over\n\nOther than the fact that \"she agreed to it\" how is it remotely fair for her to pay for your living space? \n\nPersonally, I think that you now have to weigh whether or not you value your relationship with your sister, or whether you value the \"fairness\" of holding her to the unfair situation she agreed to originally. But most of all, I have to say, the fact that you haven't figured out that you're getting more than you pay for here makes me lean YTA.", "She should have started with the 2/3 from the beginning.\n\nYou are with 3 ppl so everyone pays 33% to make it fair.", "YTA. \n\nYou're 3 people sharing, all rent and bills should be split 3 ways. It's unfair for her to be paying 50% when you're only paying 25% each. So what if she has a new car- the money is not fair and equal.", "ESH\n\nShe should not have decided to change after you moved in. Had you known you\u2019d be paying 2/3, you and your husband may have said no. \n\nBut you should be paying more than half.", "YTA\n\nAgreeing to split it 50/50 makes no sense.  I'm not saying the answer should be 3 ways;  but not 50/50.  \n\nThink about it:  You & your partner use 2/3s of the uilties.  You get the largest bedroom (of the 2), with the third being equally shared.  Etc.\n\nNow, your sister realized this - brought it up to you.  You had a reasonable discussion - and honestly, what you came up - seemed like a reasonable compromise.  At this point, I don't think there are any assholes.\n\nNow, you go into asshole territory.\n\nThen, you went back on it after speaking to your parents/aunt - and presenting things from YOUR POV.  (not your sisters).  They agree with you, so you go back to your sister and dictate that.\n\nOf course she was pissed off.  You used the rest of your family to gang up on her - and from her perspective, likely poisoned the well (by presenting it from your POV).", "I think you and your husband pay 65% of the rent is fair as you use  the larger bedroom and share the extra room .\n\nI think you should pay 2/3 of the utilities because you are 2/3s of the users of the utilities.  No one is an AH. kt", "ESH, it should have been split 3 ways from the start.", "YTA, and this is why I\u2019d never live with a couple. It\u2019ll be 2v1 for every disagreement", "ESH.\n\nTwo thirds of the people, getting two thirds of the bedrooms, using two thirds of the utilities, should pay two thirds of the rent. YTA for thinking otherwise.  The Sister accepting one deal then demanding a change after things are agreed is also an AH.", "YTA. I am going to assume your sister agreed to this wildly unfair split because she was desperate to get out. Think about it: there are three people using utilities; she\u2019s contributing 1/3 of the usage and paying 1/2 of the bill. That\u2019s unfair. For all common areas, she is 1 of 3 people, once again being 1/3 of the use but paying 1/2 of the bill. You can argue the bedrooms are closer to even but even then you and your husband have the bigger one. \n\nI share a place with a sibling and my husband. Hubs is still waiting on his green card and can\u2019t work. I earn piss all, which is why I\u2019m here in the first place. Guess what, I pay 2/3 of the utilities because we together are 2/3 of the usage. We have rent split so the private areas that are legitimately split 50/50 are paid for 50/50 and the common areas are split 66/33 and I pay the bulk. Being a married couple makes you a unit in that you\u2019re both responsible for each other\u2026 not that you get to pretend you\u2019re only one person\u2019s worth of space and utilities and make your sister subsidize your life. \n\nShe should\u2019ve said it earlier and of course you were taken off guard by a change to the agreement, but the fact is the agreement you had is wildly unfair to your sister, you ARE screwing her over, and if you give a flying crap about her you should care about remedying that. You\u2019re being stupendously selfish by insisting on keeping to an agreement it\u2019s painfully clear to everyone on the outside looking in is forcing your sister to subsidize your life. Be better to her.\n\nEdit: Your parents are TA too for conflating continuing to take advantage of their other daughter as \u201csticking up for yourself.\u201d I see why she wanted to get away from them.", "YTA. I don't see how you two have convinced yourself that the original agreement was fair but I'm assuming greed has a lot to do with it. You get a two for one deal. She's subsidizing everything from the bigger bedroom to the showers you take.\n\nShe should've realized it earlier, but she is indeed being screwed over and the fact that her entire family are happy to do it *and* make judgmental digs at her spending at the same time really sucks for her. I'd be pretty pissed too.", "Yta. 3 ppl in the house, split bills 3 ways", "YTA. you are 2/3 of the household and should pay 2/3. It\u2019s not unfair for her to negotiate, it was unfair arrangement to begin with. It\u2019s not even about ya\u2019ll making more, even if she thinks it is. you are 2/3 of the residents.", "There\u2019s 2 of you so you should pay for 2/3 of groceries and utilities because you use more I guess, not sure about the rent though because you\u2019re both only using 1 and 1/2 bedrooms so aren\u2019t exactly taking up more space than her", "Meh. Her idea, suggestion etc. buying a new car she didn\u2019t need really tipped the scales for me. \n\nI\u2019m curious how much a 1-bed, 1-bath would cost her sister on her own. Good luck getting a place in most areas with that income and no roommates, unless you want to live in a shithole.", "YTA. I get that changing the agreement now is kind of crap, but it also doesn't make sense for her to pay the same as 2 people. It sounds like you're trying to take advantage of her.", "YTA.  \nThere's 2 of you, you get the bigger room, you two use up more utilities, but she has to pay HALF?\nYes, it sucks that she brought it up afterwards but she didn't realize how unfair this arrangement is until after you guys moved in. And if you actually care about your sister, you wouldn't screw her like that by making her pay more than her fair share.", "ESH. The original agreement should have been 2/3 and 1/3. You have the bigger room, you take up more water, electricity, etc. but you knew you were getting a good deal. Your sister screwed herself, and it's now too late to change the terms after everyone moved in.", "Might the wine talking, but NTA!!!\n\nReading through OP's comments, it's pretty clear the sister manipulated the situation so OP would agree.\nWhen OP was hesitant, the sister offered the 50/50 as a bargaining chip, that turned the tide and OP agreed.\nAfter the lease was signed, she rescinded on the agreement and OP is now expected to pay more than what she was comfortable with.\n\nHad the current arrangement been on the table, OP would not have accepted.\n\nI found it odd that everyone was siding with OP and not the sister, until I reas the comments.\n\nOP, this info needs to be in your post, not buried between comments.", "Rent should be split based on usage. You have the larger room? You should pay more.

I assume the sister was ok with the 50/50 split as a means to get out of the parents house.  Then she waited until a lease was signed and decided it wasn't fair?\n\nIt sounds like she used you for her needs, then tried to cry victim later.   \n\nI don't think it was a great agreement on her part, but sometimes if she is the person who needs the other side more, you take a less fair agreement to get the benefits  you are looking for.    I just don't think she didn't think of this before.", "NTA your sister is. She needs to honor her agreement or get out.

Your sister agreed to your original offer and is now suddenly changing her mind because she realizes you and your husband have more disposable income and can afford to pay more, all while she recently bought a new car.

You and your husband aren't 1 entity. \n\nSounds like your sister was trying to move out ASAP and thought hey 50/50 sounds fair. She's an idiot in her own right but idk how you didn't look at the situation at face value and go \"my sister is getting hosed here\"", "ESH.  First off, trying to renegotiate and then getting that upset *after* the fact is poor form.  She agreed and even was the one to suggest it, so getting twisted later on is not really reasonable.  \n\nHowever, paying half when it's all three of you living there and you DO have the bigger bedroom is not fair to her even if she did agree in the first place.\n\nYou can make an argument that 2/3rds vs 1/3rd isn't a fair or reasonable split, but let's face it 50/50 is far less equitable than what shes asking.  You absolutely are taking advantage of your sister, and a compromise should be in order.  Even a 60/40 overall or 2/3rds on utilities would make it more balanced.", "ESH\n\nSplit was unfair to begin with IMO.  Each human counts in a shared living environment and should bare their share of the bills.  Sister should move someone in if she is paying 50% but only getting 1/3 of the value. \n\nYou took advantage of a good deal, and she realized her mistake and wanted to renegotiate. Another stellar example of why you should not live with friends or family unless it is a truly dire circumstance.", "I'm surprised at all the you being the asshole votes. I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nIn your defense OP, you made an agreement assuming that everyone was getting what they wanted. Your sister gets to move out of the house and live with roommates she knows, and you and your husband get to save on rent. Meanwhile, she has to sacrifice by paying more than her normal share of rent, and you two have to sacrifice by living with a roommate when you could live alone. That sounds like a reasonably fair tradeoff for both of you imo.\n\nThat said, if your sister hasn't lived out of the house, I can see why she would underestimate the cost and the resentment that would build from paying a disproportionally large amount. Now she's probably realizing it wasn't as good of a deal as she hoped it would be. If anything, it's more her fault for not predicting what she wanted and needed, but it's an understandable mistake for a young person to make. Although frankly, you should ALSO have recognized this highly likely issue and addressed it in advance.\n\nIn my opinion, you should both renegotiate to a slightly fairer balance. If you cannot come to a compromise, then you should contact the landlord and try to get out of the lease (which is usually no issue, especially if you help find a replacement tenant).", "She\u2019s not wrong. The agreement is unfair to her. Utilities should definitely be split by thirds. Since she has access to the spare room you have an argument for rent being 60/40 but it really should be in thirds as well.\n\nHowever she bait and switched you guys by paying 50% to get you guys to agree to being roommates so she could move out. \n\nConsidering she baited you the compromise of taking on basically 2/3 of utilities and 60% of rent is generous on your part.

Because you argue that your husband is not often home and it\u2019s like it\u2019s only 2 of you sharing the apartment (BS) then why don\u2019t you let her have the bigger room? Is it because there are two of you and you NEED the bigger room? So much for your argument.\n\nYou had an oral agreement on how to split the rent and she wants to change it because she now realizes how unfair it is. You can\u2019t justify it because \u201cwe had a deal\u201d when you admitted that it was inequitable before you moved in.

I didn\u2019t think so!\n\nYou and she made an agreement- right, wrong, or indifferent the agreement was made before signing a lease and moving in.  It was even her suggestion to split 50-50.

I don't understand this kind of family. Since you love your sister, make things fair or risk losing the relationship.", "NTA  it's great to being open to renegotiation based on who is using the resources. Makes sense that you and your husband should pay 2/3 of the utilities. But it does sound like the rent being 50:50 is still fair. \nWhy should you pay more because she decided to overextend her finances? That you two earn more has no bearing on what you should pay. \nTake time to think about what is fair in terms of the space.", "NTA. \nSister shouldn't have offered the original split. If she can't afford it, then she can move back in with your parents. \n\nMake sure to no longer sign a lease or listen to any of her half-brained ideas.", "You are 3 people in an apartment. You split living expenses 3 ways. Your relationship status is irrelevant here. \n\nYou may have an argument personally to pay less than the other two because you make significantly less than your husband and sister.  Many people living together split expenses proportionally to income so one person isn\u2019t paying most of their pay on expenses while the other is swimming in disposable income.", "Why is your income any kind of factor in how much rent to pay?  All the comments banging on about that seem whack to me. If I had a roommate no way in hell would they get me to pay more because I earn more.  You should pay your fair share. When it comes to utilities it matters. Each person uses utilities and therefore you and your husband should pay 2/3\n\nI would think the two of you should pay something more than her but less than 2/3 of the rent since your husband and your sister both use the spare room.  You all use all the common spaces, and you commented that sister uses half of the 4 bathrooms. \n\nAsk yourself this.  Would you find a comparable amount of space that you use for 800 a month, and is this all worth the fuss?   Would she go for 700 a month and 2/3 utilities?   I feel like an extra body should mean more in rent even if you are sharing a bedroom.  However what you earn should not be the reason you pay more. It should be all about how much you consume energy wise and space wise.  If you are taking up 2/3 of the space *some of the time* then maybe a little extra rent is appropriate?  Definitely the utilities should be split and you should go back over them and pay her for what you should have been paying all along.   \n\nI think ESH.  You and your husband for not paying 2/3 utilities from the get go, your sister for trying to get you to pay more because you earn more, and your parents for getting you all stirred up over a renegotiation that was between you and your sister. \n\nThe good news is if she decides to move out when the lease is up, you and your husband can find your own place and space and everyone will be happy.  Just try and keep from running to your parents about every little thing.  It sounds like she feels like you are the golden child and they always take your side.  How they could agree that half the utilities is remotely fair is beyond me.  The fact she wanted to get out from under them tells me there is something there and maybe you should take a good hard look at how much your parents might have favored you over the years.", "I was teetering between Y T A and E S H, but ultimately decided on ESH. \n\nOP and her husband = For agreeing to 50/50.

Back when we had roommates the two of us shared a bathroom and our roommate had their own. My partner and I also took showers together and our shared shower typically took as long as those of our solo roommate. These things aren't always as cut and dry as they look on paper.", "I agree with this completely.  More than half.  The 65% part sounded reasonable.  Slightly bigger bedroom, slightly more utility usage.  It may not be 1/3 1/3 1/3 since the couple shares space but it isn\u2019t 50/50 either.\n\nChanging after the fact made it a big deal.  She had plenty of time to consider the arrangement before they moved, after the fact is too late but also OP would be reasonable to compromise.", "33% for utilities but rooms should be split based on size.", ">Think about it:  You & your partner use 2/3s of the uilties.  You get the largest bedroom (of the 2), with the third being equally shared.

Utility usage may also be vastly different if sister WFH full-time and the other two work outside the home. \n\nHonestly, I think it\u2019s ESH. Sister used the 50/50 split to entice the OP into a situation and a larger apartment than OP otherwise might have agreed to, and OP and her husband are crappy because, even with what I mentioned above, I don\u2019t think a 50/50 split was ever fair. \n\nI\u2019d say a probably complicated but most fair to everyone way of splitting it: figure out square footage of all bedrooms, and square footage of all common areas and express those as total percent of apartment\u2014ie bedroom space is 40% of rent, common areas are 60%, etc). Then, the percentage of square footage OP, OP\u2019s husband, and sister get (so if OP has 25% of bedroom space, and her share is 25% of the 40%, and do the same for husband and sister), then split common area into thirds, so OP and husband  end up paying 67% (66.6 rounded). \n\nI could be ok with 50/50 on utilities if sister is home more/it\u2019s justified. But I\u2019d say it should probably be closer to 60/40 at minimum (since OP seemed to acknowledge she is there frequently even if her husband isn\u2019t. \n\nSo as an example, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a 1400 square foot apartment, with 500 of it as bedroom space. Assuming (based on the edit for master and one bedroom) OP and her husband have the master, which is about 180 square feet (I\u2019ll just make the other two bedrooms the same size for ease\u2014so 160 square feet per).\n\nSo it would look something like this:\nTotal rent $1295\n\nBedroom space is ~36% of the apartment (or $466.20). \nOP gets 90 square feet or 18% of bedroom space=$83.92\nHusband gets 90+80 of the second room=170=34%=158.51\nSister gets 160+80=240=48%=223.77\n\nCommon areas $828.3/3=276.26 (with 0.01 left over so I mean, does that matter who pays?) \n\nOP would be assigned 83.92+276.26 (360.18)\nHer husband would be assigned 158.51+276.26 (434.77)\nAnd sister would be assigned 223.77+276.26 (500.03)\n\nThis ends up with sister ultimately paying ~38.3% of total rent, which is pretty close to the initial split I suggested for utilities.

As common areas are still shared by each person. 2/3 rent is way too much. I would have put it at 42%. HOWEVER, there is an amount below which its not worth it to take the roommate.

I know that you moved based on the original agreement but as you have the larger room and to find a compromise that everyone can live with, how about a 45% / 55% split?\n\nI think the 2/3 utilities split is mandatory. \n\nGood luck, negotiating roommate situations can be difficult, especially when you are trying to maintain existing relationships.", "I'm going against the grain here, but NTA.

There are calculators online that can help with calculating that split but if OP and her husband are sharing a room they do not need to pay 2/3. \n\nEdit: out of curiosity I put the info into this calculator:\n\nRoom 1 (couple\u2019s bedroom, large): $542.97 ($271.49/person)\n\nRoom 2 (sister\u2019s room): $311.26\n\nRoom 3 (sister and husband office): $440.76 ($220.38/person)\n\nSo OP should be paying $271.49\nHusband should be paying $491.87\nSister should be paying $531.64", "Just for getting the larger bedroom and additional office they should pay more.\n\nDon\u2019t think it\u2019s quite fair to say they use 2/3 of the utilities, but it should also not be an even split. (2 people in a room don\u2019t use more electricity for light than 1. The cable bill is the same no matter how many people watch tv, etc)\n\nThere\u2019s basically 2 families sharing this home, even if one family is a single person. They should definitely pay more but the person getting only 1/3 rent while the couple shares a bedroom isn\u2019t fair either.", "And OP and husband get 2/3 of the bedrooms then, right?\n\nIf they're going to pay for 2br anyway, why would they bother to live with the sister? They would just rent a 2br apartment by themselves and save all the hassle that comes with having to share a home with a roommate.\n\nThe only reason they agreed in the first place was because the financial incentive made up for their reservations and the inconvenience of living with someone else.\n\nThe sister had to pay more, but was finally able move out of home because of it.", "No husband shares a room with both sisters. Sister gets 1.5 rooms, OP gets 0.5.", "I think the problem is that they made a new agreement and then OP went back on that agreement.

Sister also clearly knew this which is why she offered 50/50 to make it hard for OP and husband to say no. It was just pure manipulation from her sister so she could move out from her parents when dad tried to explain bills and budgeting to her.", "IKR? The YTA are not reading the post carefully. I can see ESH at worst, but sister is the bigger AH.", "Math would say do not buy a new car when you arleady have one when you first move out. Especially when the DAD warned sister she couldn't afford it.", "Are we glossing over the fact where the sister used OP and her husband to move out? OP even mentioned if they knew beforehand it would be 2/3 1/3 they would simply chose to live alone without a 3rd.

In no universe is OP the AH. One could say the agreement the SISTER made was not even, but then that is ESH since sister bought a car and now is broke.", "Exactly! She made her own bed even after being warned by their father. She is either NTA or ESH, but the sister is the AH.", "Did you NOT read that the sister bought a brand new CAR? That's why she is trying to renegotiate and their father told her that she couldn't afford it before she bought it.", "Agreed. I just think to reinforce that OP is an AH too - she\u2019s married and that essentially guarantees that she\u2019s had a lot more experience figuring out \u201cfair\u201d with a husband and more thorough financial discussion and navigation with a partner.\n\nThey had an opportunity to recognize that paying 50% for things didn\u2019t make sense, both utilities and the extra space in the bedroom. That and the inherent use of the rest of the space. This isn\u2019t some kind of haggling with a street vendor, trying to get it for a steal, this is making a big financial commitment with a family member. You don\u2019t just take the best deal for you regardless of fairness. But of course they jumped at the opportunity to save money and neglected to question whether a financially inexperienced sibling might be overcommitting. It\u2019s not completely one sided, but with two individuals v one, it\u2019s not exactly a 50/50 decision.\n\nAnd to add to that OP has been rallying support from family members and causing a sister who makes half what she and her husband make to feel awful about recognizing she struck a bad deal and asking her sister to reconsider.", "Everyone is missing that it was the sister who found the house. I think she wanted a nice big house.", "Exactly. And it\u2019s not just OP, it\u2019s her husband too. They loved the idea of getting 2/3 of a space and utilities for less than their due, then belittled the sister and rallied support from family to force her to \u201cstick to her word,\u201d like some kind of condescending, mansplaining dickwad.\n\nPeople are SO short sighted. This is the kind of thing that will stay with OP\u2019s sister for many years. Dealing with things like this can straight up destroy relationships with family members, and rightfully so.", "Fair is the fully-informed freely agreed upon price. \n\nIn this case (as long as we trust OP\u2019s narrative), it was Sister who proposed the price. It\u2019s her responsibility to stand by what she said. \n\nIf it were OP who bullied Sis into the original deal, or lied going into it, the price wouldn\u2019t have been fair.", "But a sister taking advantage of another sister?", "I'd say the sister is trying to screw them over. Propose a good deal that they agree to so she can move out of the house and then say the terms she proposed are unfair.  She's not a child. She's an adult.  I'm sure it was proposed that way, because why would  a married couple want roommates if they can get a 2 bedroom around that price without them. They wouldn't need 3 bedrooms if the sister wasn't there. She's the one that asked them, not the other way around.", "Why does the car matter?", "This is OP\u2019s twin sister. For one of you this will be the longest relationship in your life. Don't fuck it up over this silliness!", "Still going to be uneven. The third bedroom is split btw OPs husband and sister so that\u2019s a wash. \n\nIt comes down to the two bedrooms and their size. OPs bedroom is larger, sisters is smaller. The couple is a unit since they\u2019re paying together so it still comes down to a 65%/35% split.", "Yeah, it\u2019s shitty of the sister to try & change the deal, but I don\u2019t have any sympathy tbh because they should\u2019ve insisted on splitting everything three ways from the start.", "No, you just got your mom and aunt to gang up on her. You use y'all's family so that your husband can keep his hands clean of this mess.", "Are you OP?", "You and your husband previously shared an apartment with higher rent which you were fine paying. Now you\u2019re \u201cuncomfortable\u201d splitting the costs of a lower rent apartment more equitably with your sister?! \n\nYour original agreement was unfair. As others have pointed out, you and your husband use 2/3 of the common spaces and 2/3 of the utilities, and what you pay should reflect that. It doesn\u2019t matter that 50/50 was your sister\u2019s idea. It\u2019s too bad she didn\u2019t realize her error before the lease was signed but thankfully she did before she subsidized your existence for a year. Don\u2019t use \u201cbut it was our agreement\u201d as an excuse to take advantage of your sister.\n\nYes, OP, YTA.", "Clearly this isn't sinking in yet... Hope you'll keep nice memories of your sis, she might decide to stop talking to you altogether, and get away from the shitty family situation.\n\nI sincerely hope you can salvage your relationship.", "No. I read it.", "And maybe OP knew how bad her sister wanted to leave and used that to take Financial advantage of her sister knowing damn well it was a completely unfair deal. You can judge that both ways. Doing that to your sister who is leaving home for the first time (and likely underestimated the costs) is a dick move. No matter what there is zero justification for the sister to be paying more than 1/3rd of the utilities. If OP wants to pretend that they are each sharing equally in the rent, then OP should give up the larger room to her sister. Then They can pay 50/50 rent  and 1/3rd each for utilities. But My guess is OP and her husband want the bigger room, thus they should be paying extra for it. Like I said - 55%-60% rent for OP.\n\nNotice this is basically what they agreed to after further discussion. It's not a coincidence they landed on those percentages. Its because that's reasonable.\n\nAlso just look at the two rooms they're occupying. 15x12 and 12x12. Thats a combined 324sqft. $1295/324=$4/sqft. That means the 15x12 room should be paying $720/month while the 12x12 room should be paying $576 just purely from the fact they get more area. Wanna know what those percentages are? hmm just so happens to be slightly over 55%.... Basically there is zero argument OP shouldn't be paying AT LEAST 55% of rent and 2/3rds of Utilities.", "Their income and car are irrelevant. Neither have anything to do with their agreement or rent and utilities.", "Well they were able to get a 3 bedroom apartment in this area for $1295, so it stands to reason they could probably get a 2br for $900-1000.\n\nThey did the sister a favour, even though it would have been preferable as a married couple to live alone.", "I think this whole thing about cost is insane. The sister should be able to afford a place on her own if a 3br is only $1300. At one point my mortgage was double that and my husband and I made about $100k combined. Splitting it, half or 1/3 makes it ridiculously affordable. Not sure why any of them are cohabiting unless they just want to save money. I feel like the maths not mathing. Do they all have debt?", "They were doing the sister a favor a 50/50 split in this situation is completely fine. You're absolutely wrong my guy.", "I would agree to paying more for utilities, but a portion of utility costs are set fees.\n\nI can kind of see your argument on the use of shared living areas, but if the sister is going to pay 1/3 of the rent, she can forfeit access to the shared office/gaming room, too.", "Definitely not unfair because the original arrangement was not OP's idea. It was her sister's. He sister wanted that deal to get out of her parents house. Also she went back on her offer after deciding to go buy a new car and decided to raise her monthly bills willingly.", "It wouldn't be a lower rent than the 50% they're paying now. They're paying $650 a month; good luck finding a 1-bed for that much, let alone a 2-bd for his gaming space.", "This is what my boyfriend and I do with our roommate in a super similar situation. 3bd/2ba house with a shared office. 60/40 is fair to all of us and utilities are split 3 ways. Highly recommend.", "No, it's not just about whose using the bedrooms when. It's about the full number of people using the entire space, common areas included. He doesn't suddenly become less of a person taking up less space because he's not using the bedroom.", "It's the unmarried sister who is taking advantage. She lied to get her sister and SO to get them to move in with her, and now wants to change the deal that SHE proposed. Maybe if they had known that's what they'd have to pay, they'd have decided to get a place just for them, without any roommates.\n\nA deal's a deal.", "Moreover, don\u2019t *suggest* agreements you don\u2019t want.", "We only have OPs word on why she bought a new car, her old one could have died or become too expensive to run. OP is just adding this to sway people because she knows she's in the wrong.", "Yeah of course it\u2019d be uneven. But making an agreement and then immediately changing it is immature and rude. If it\u2019s really not a problem then they can change the agreement but the sister is still a jerk for pulling a bait and switch.", "Life is tough that way.\n\nThere are a lot of ways in which life shouldn't be tough, and that sucks, but suddenly deciding you can't afford your rent is not something you can really do.", "Why would you insist on a deal that is worse for you. \n\nOP isn't the one who needed or wanted a roommate, the sister did.  I can see OP being like \"well, this is still cheaper than her getting a place, and she is clearly desperate to get out\"", "> Well, you don't really know how something is going to shake out until you are living it\n\nI agree.  I moved in with a friend once and it was clear pretty quickly we didn't work as roommates.  But I didn't try to change the agreement at that point either.  That is my issue.", "But the sister being the one to **propose** the split *is* 100% relevant. \n\nShe is old enough to say \u201cI really want to move out, hey OP, if I pay 1/2, would you and hubby be willing to rent a place together?\u201d and be expected to hold up her end.", "She did not get bamboozled. She offered the deal. Like wtf. Is there no accountability anymore? While i agree that they could change the arrangement, I dont think that OP is TA because they could have just chosen to not live with rhe sister if they new this is gonna ba shit show.", "Like OC above me, she didn\u2019t get \u201cbamboozled.\u201d She proposed what she believed to be a fair deal. \n\nIt\u2019d be like selling something from your parents attic for 25$.

You can judge that both ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My twin sister suggested that we all live together\n\nThe argument stops going both ways since it was OP's sister's idea, not OP's. I can't come to you with a plan and a price, have you sign my plan and price, then tell you after \"anyways ive changed my mind so im changing it\" If OP and sister came to 50/50 together sure, i could see the argument you were making, but the fact of the matter is the sister did that all on her own.", "I was surprised to learn this isn\u2019t the case most of the time if you\u2019re talking about cost. Almost places I\u2019ve lived a 2 bedroom is just slightly more expensive than a 1 bedroom. It\u2019s because it\u2019s just one room, versus the base price of having a room, plus kitchen, plus bathroom, etc. You definitely get to ditch the demanding sister so it was worth it for me, but definitely is costing me more for that privacy.", "It\u2019s possible for sure but not as possible as you might think everywhere in the country. The price of a place to live doesn\u2019t vary dramatically by number of bedrooms, unless those bedrooms are rather large. More often the square footage of the added bedroom isn\u2019t much compared to what you\u2019re already paying to live in that area or level of comfort. Definitely cheaper to get a 2 bedroom vs 3 most of the time, but not always at 2/3 of the cost of the larger place. Seriously depends on urban versus rural though.", "The car is irrelevant to the conversation.", "And the sister can make all these points when the lease is up for renewal, because she failed to do so when initiating the agreement.", "Yeah, I mean, why not go to the landlord and renegotiate the rent?\n\nOh, yeah, not gonna work.  Why should it work on OP and her husband, who were kind enough to take her in as a roommate?", "I don\u2019t know this for sure but I can imagine that she probably felt the need to sweeten the pot, as it were, to get them on board, since she clearly can\u2019t afford to live alone. \n\nLike, you\u2019re all right that she proposed the 50/50 split and to some extent knew what she was walking into. It\u2019s also her first time leaving her parents\u2019 house, so I don\u2019t think she fully understood what she was putting herself into in advance.

This isn\u2019t even someone who\u2019s relatively well off compared to OP + husband communally. This is OP\u2019s sister. She\u2019s taking financial advantage of her sister who isn\u2019t well enough off to live alone because \u201cwell, it was her idea.\u201d If your own damn family won\u2019t cut you some slack when you, as a young adult leaving the nest for the first time, realize your painted yourself into a crappy corner where you\u2019re being taken advantage of, you got some shitty family, man. If we want to be all legalistic about it, sure. OP can stick to the original agreement. But she\u2019s still being an asshole to her sister.

It sounds like they could've easily afforded a two-bedroom place for themselves, and not had the sister underfoot all the time.\n\nAbsent the 50/50 rent split offer, they would've.\n\nAnd now the sister suddenly wants to change the terms of the deal?  The time to do that was before they signed the lease.", "Nope. It is one family unit to one family unit. A 50/50 split is equitable and appropriate AND the sister not only agreed to it, but proposed it.", "50/50 is fair since they're doing the sister a favor and 50/50 was part of the favor.

OP only \u201cprobably would have\u201d gotten their own place if the split was more fair, meaning that even if they paid their proper share this would still be a beneficial arrangement for them. At the very least they should\u2019ve agreed to paying 2/3 of the utilities when the sister brought up that the split wasn\u2019t fair, because clearly sister isn\u2019t using up half of the utilities.", "I think they should offer to move out once sister can find a housemate or two to replace them.", "And perhaps the sister didn't realize what living with a couple would be like (in terms of who uses what and how much) so that is why her terms changed after they had been living together for a while. I do agree that changing the terms after the fact is not a good move, however, it doesn't seem like OP or her hubby gave ANY thought to paying extra for anything being that they are two people to sister's one.", "You can't treat OP her husband and the sister as 3 separate people and then combine OP and her husbands salary together when discussing what they make. \n\nIs the situation fair. No OP and their husband should be paying more, wouldn't say they should be paying 2/3 though. But this is to be brought up before things are signed not after the fact. From what we are giving it seems the sister wanted to move to a nicer area but couldn't afford it on her own so she asked OP and the husband to be roommates. OP seems to have agreed to help the sister out but would rather have had no roommates. \n\nAlso it feels that the sister thought it would be easier to bully the OP into paying more after the lease was signed then before, very likely knowing that OP would have just not agreed if she broached the subject with OP before hand."]}
