{"id": 28709, "submission_id": "175ilu4", "title": "AITA for Refusing to Pay More Rent?", "selftext": "My (24F) husband (25M) and I recently moved back to the state I\u2019m from. My twin sister suggested that we all live together so that she can move out of our parents\u2019 house. At first, we were hesitant. However, we eventually agreed because it would be mutually beneficial. She found the place, a 3-bed at $1295/mo + utilities. When asking about how we would split up the rent + utilities, she said that she would split everything 50/50 with us. This is an agreement we came to a few months ago. \n\n2 weeks ago, we signed the lease + moved in. We agreed that my husband + I would share the larger bedroom, she would get one room, and she + my husband would share the spare room as a home office/gaming room. We were all getting along great until my sister approached me, explaining that after she\u2019s done some thinking, she no longer believes that our original agreement is fair because we make more money than she does. (For context, I make $29k/yr, my husband makes $55k/yr, and my sister makes $45k/yr). She proceeded to suggest that we pay 2/3 rent + utilities and that she pays 1/3.  I was caught off-guard by the conversation. I had to think about what she said and talk to my husband. I didn\u2019t want to argue with her or make her upset, so we negotiated down to us paying $800 while she pays $495 for rent and that we would pay 65% of utilities. I still didn\u2019t feel right about this, but I tried seeing it from her POV. \n\nThe next day, I spoke to my parents + my aunt about it. My parents + aunt both agreed that it was unfair for her to renegotiate now. After speaking with them, I realized that I needed to speak with her again + insist that we go back to our original agreement. I approached her that night saying that I knew we had discussed this, but the more I thought and talked with my husband (who also felt it was unfair), the more I felt it was unfair for her to go back on our original agreement. Before I could finish explaining my first thought, she began to interrupt + argue with me. She got upset and walked away from the conversation, saying that as soon as our lease was up (in 1 yr), she would find somewhere else to live. At this point, I was shocked at how upset and angry she became. I ended up leaving the house for a bit with my husband to chat when I received a call from my parents. \n\nThey explained that my sister had called them crying and yelling, saying that they needed to stay out of our business. She had the sentiment that she had been screwed over and that everyone was against her and taking my side. \n\nFor context, she just bought a new car (not out of necessity, she just wanted a newer one). My dad said that he tried discussing bills with her, but she insisted she could afford it easily. I feel guilty, but my family is telling me that I did the right thing by sticking up for myself. Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: This arrangement was my sister\u2019s idea from the beginning. She offered 50/50 split. If she told me she wanted me to pay more before, I would probably have chosen for my husband and I to live alone. Also, my sister uses two bathrooms (1 full, 1 half) out of the 4 (2 full, 2 half, the other half bath is downstairs for guests). My husband also works so much that it basically is like only me and her share the apartment most of the time.\n\nAnother edit: When I say bigger room, our room is 15x12 ft, hers is 12x12 ft. Also, I am very willing for us to pay 2/3 for utilities and she pay 1/3, so I will speak to her again once she\u2019s willing. This whole thing has been a whirlwind of big feelings and certainly not reflective of our lifelong relationship. We love each other very much, and neither of us would ever purposefully screw each other over.", "created_utc": 1697042503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175ilu4/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_more_rent/", "score": 522, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re sister definitely shouldn\u2019t have tried to change the rent agreement after signing the lease nor should she have gotten mad when you said no. With that being said your current rent agreement is definitely not fair because she as an individual person is paying the same amount of rent as two people. You did the math on how much you and your husband would pay together if you split the rent 2/3 and 1/3 but you didn\u2019t think to break it down to show what you each pay individually. Currently you and your husband each pay around $324 in rent whereas your sister pays around $648. If you were to split it into you and your husband paying 2/3s of the rent. That means all three of you would be paying around $432 in rent. Yes for you and your husband it adds up to be over $800 together but if you consider it as your three individuals who all have their own income and are all paying for rent then splitting it into thirds is much more fair than splitting it in half but having two people contribute to one of those halves of rent.", "ESH - Your sister sucks for waiting until AFFTER the lease was signed to try and renegotiate how payment should be split. \n\nBut on the other hand, you suck for \u201cnot feeling right\u201d about splitting things fairly. You and your husband are two people. You take up more space and will ultimately use more utilities.\n\nYou all should have talked more before moving, but you and your husband should definitely be paying 2/3 rent and 2/3 utilities if you really want it to be fair. It has nothing to do with who makes more and everything to do with paying each person\u2019s fair share. You and your husband together are not one person, so you shouldn\u2019t be paying the same as one person.", "Bro your agreement is terribly unfair. You use 2/3rds of the bathroom and pay for half. You use 2/3rds of the fridge space and pay for half. 2/3rds of all the common areas, 2/3rds of the utilities, the only thing you actually \"split\" 50/50 is the bedrooms, and even then yours is larger! \n\n>My parents + aunt both agreed that it was unfair for her to renegotiate now.\n\nI guess, but it's an unreasonable split anyway and you should have seen this coming. Pay for what you use, don't expect your sister to subsidize your rent. \n\n>She had the sentiment that she had been screwed over\n\nOther than the fact that \"she agreed to it\" how is it remotely fair for her to pay for your living space? \n\nPersonally, I think that you now have to weigh whether or not you value your relationship with your sister, or whether you value the \"fairness\" of holding her to the unfair situation she agreed to originally. But most of all, I have to say, the fact that you haven't figured out that you're getting more than you pay for here makes me lean YTA.", "She should have started with the 2/3 from the beginning.\n\nYou are with 3 ppl so everyone pays 33% to make it fair.", "YTA. \n\nYou're 3 people sharing, all rent and bills should be split 3 ways. It's unfair for her to be paying 50% when you're only paying 25% each. So what if she has a new car- the money is not fair and equal.", "ESH\n\nShe should not have decided to change after you moved in. Had you known you\u2019d be paying 2/3, you and your husband may have said no. \n\nBut you should be paying more than half.", "YTA\n\nAgreeing to split it 50/50 makes no sense.  I'm not saying the answer should be 3 ways;  but not 50/50.  \n\nThink about it:  You & your partner use 2/3s of the uilties.  You get the largest bedroom (of the 2), with the third being equally shared.  Etc.\n\nNow, your sister realized this - brought it up to you.  You had a reasonable discussion - and honestly, what you came up - seemed like a reasonable compromise.  At this point, I don't think there are any assholes.\n\nNow, you go into asshole territory.\n\nThen, you went back on it after speaking to your parents/aunt - and presenting things from YOUR POV.  (not your sisters).  They agree with you, so you go back to your sister and dictate that.\n\nOf course she was pissed off.  You used the rest of your family to gang up on her - and from her perspective, likely poisoned the well (by presenting it from your POV).", "I think you and your husband pay 65% of the rent is fair as you use  the larger bedroom and share the extra room .\n\nI think you should pay 2/3 of the utilities because you are 2/3s of the users of the utilities.

It\u2019ll be 2v1 for every disagreement", "ESH.\n\nTwo thirds of the people, getting two thirds of the bedrooms, using two thirds of the utilities, should pay two thirds of the rent. YTA for thinking otherwise.  The Sister accepting one deal then demanding a change after things are agreed is also an AH.", "YTA. I am going to assume your sister agreed to this wildly unfair split because she was desperate to get out. Think about it: there are three people using utilities; she\u2019s contributing 1/3 of the usage and paying 1/2 of the bill. That\u2019s unfair. For all common areas, she is 1 of 3 people, once again being 1/3 of the use but paying 1/2 of the bill. You can argue the bedrooms are closer to even but even then you and your husband have the bigger one. \n\nI share a place with a sibling and my husband. Hubs is still waiting on his green card and can\u2019t work. I earn piss all, which is why I\u2019m here in the first place. Guess what, I pay 2/3 of the utilities because we together are 2/3 of the usage. We have rent split so the private areas that are legitimately split 50/50 are paid for 50/50 and the common areas are split 66/33 and I pay the bulk. Being a married couple makes you a unit in that you\u2019re both responsible for each other\u2026 not that you get to pretend you\u2019re only one person\u2019s worth of space and utilities and make your sister subsidize your life. \n\nShe should\u2019ve said it earlier and of course you were taken off guard by a change to the agreement, but the fact is the agreement you had is wildly unfair to your sister, you ARE screwing her over, and if you give a flying crap about her you should care about remedying that. You\u2019re being stupendously selfish by insisting on keeping to an agreement it\u2019s painfully clear to everyone on the outside looking in is forcing your sister to subsidize your life. Be better to her.\n\nEdit: Your parents are TA too for conflating continuing to take advantage of their other daughter as \u201csticking up for yourself.\u201d I see why she wanted to get away from them.", "YTA. I don't see how you two have convinced yourself that the original agreement was fair but I'm assuming greed has a lot to do with it. You get a two for one deal. She's subsidizing everything from the bigger bedroom to the showers you take.\n\nShe should've realized it earlier, but she is indeed being screwed over and the fact that her entire family are happy to do it *and* make judgmental digs at her spending at the same time really sucks for her. I'd be pretty pissed too.", "Yta. 3 ppl in the house, split bills 3 ways", "YTA. you are 2/3 of the household and should pay 2/3. It\u2019s not unfair for her to negotiate, it was unfair arrangement to begin with. It\u2019s not even about ya\u2019ll making more, even if she thinks it is. you are 2/3 of the residents.", "There\u2019s 2 of you so you should pay for 2/3 of groceries and utilities because you use more I guess, not sure about the rent though because you\u2019re both only using 1 and 1/2 bedrooms so aren\u2019t exactly taking up more space than her", "Meh. Her idea, suggestion etc. buying a new car she didn\u2019t need really tipped the scales for me. \n\nI\u2019m curious how much a 1-bed, 1-bath would cost her sister on her own. Good luck getting a place in most areas with that income and no roommates, unless you want to live in a shithole.", "YTA. I get that changing the agreement now is kind of crap, but it also doesn't make sense for her to pay the same as 2 people. It sounds like you're trying to take advantage of her.", "YTA.  \nThere's 2 of you, you get the bigger room, you two use up more utilities, but she has to pay HALF?\nYes, it sucks that she brought it up afterwards but she didn't realize how unfair this arrangement is until after you guys moved in. And if you actually care about your sister, you wouldn't screw her like that by making her pay more than her fair share.", "ESH. The original agreement should have been 2/3 and 1/3. You have the bigger room, you take up more water, electricity, etc. but you knew you were getting a good deal. Your sister screwed herself, and it's now too late to change the terms after everyone moved in.", "Might the wine talking, but NTA!!!\n\nReading through OP's comments, it's pretty clear the sister manipulated the situation so OP would agree.\nWhen OP was hesitant, the sister offered the 50/50 as a bargaining chip, that turned the tide and OP agreed.\nAfter the lease was signed, she rescinded on the agreement and OP is now expected to pay more than what she was comfortable with.\n\nHad the current arrangement been on the table, OP would not have accepted.\n\nI found it odd that everyone was siding with OP and not the sister, until I reas the comments.\n\nOP, this info needs to be in your post, not buried between comments.", "Rent should be split based on usage.

I assume the sister was ok with the 50/50 split as a means to get out of the parents house.  Then she waited until a lease was signed and decided it wasn't fair?\n\nIt sounds like she used you for her needs, then tried to cry victim later.   \n\nI don't think it was a great agreement on her part, but sometimes if she is the person who needs the other side more, you take a less fair agreement to get the benefits  you are looking for.    I just don't think she didn't think of this before.", "NTA your sister is. She needs to honor her agreement or get out.

You and your husband aren't 1 entity. \n\nSounds like your sister was trying to move out ASAP and thought hey 50/50 sounds fair. She's an idiot in her own right but idk how you didn't look at the situation at face value and go \"my sister is getting hosed here\"", "ESH.  First off, trying to renegotiate and then getting that upset *after* the fact is poor form.  She agreed and even was the one to suggest it, so getting twisted later on is not really reasonable.  \n\nHowever, paying half when it's all three of you living there and you DO have the bigger bedroom is not fair to her even if she did agree in the first place.\n\nYou can make an argument that 2/3rds vs 1/3rd isn't a fair or reasonable split, but let's face it 50/50 is far less equitable than what shes asking.  You absolutely are taking advantage of your sister, and a compromise should be in order.  Even a 60/40 overall or 2/3rds on utilities would make it more balanced.", "ESH\n\nSplit was unfair to begin with IMO.  Each human counts in a shared living environment and should bare their share of the bills.  Sister should move someone in if she is paying 50% but only getting 1/3 of the value. \n\nYou took advantage of a good deal, and she realized her mistake and wanted to renegotiate. Another stellar example of why you should not live with friends or family unless it is a truly dire circumstance.", "I'm surprised at all the you being the asshole votes. I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nIn your defense OP, you made an agreement assuming that everyone was getting what they wanted. Your sister gets to move out of the house and live with roommates she knows, and you and your husband get to save on rent. Meanwhile, she has to sacrifice by paying more than her normal share of rent, and you two have to sacrifice by living with a roommate when you could live alone. That sounds like a reasonably fair tradeoff for both of you imo.\n\nThat said, if your sister hasn't lived out of the house, I can see why she would underestimate the cost and the resentment that would build from paying a disproportionally large amount. Now she's probably realizing it wasn't as good of a deal as she hoped it would be. If anything, it's more her fault for not predicting what she wanted and needed, but it's an understandable mistake for a young person to make. Although frankly, you should ALSO have recognized this highly likely issue and addressed it in advance.\n\nIn my opinion, you should both renegotiate to a slightly fairer balance. If you cannot come to a compromise, then you should contact the landlord and try to get out of the lease (which is usually no issue, especially if you help find a replacement tenant).", "She\u2019s not wrong. The agreement is unfair to her. Utilities should definitely be split by thirds. Since she has access to the spare room you have an argument for rent being 60/40 but it really should be in thirds as well.\n\nHowever she bait and switched you guys by paying 50% to get you guys to agree to being roommates so she could move out. \n\nConsidering she baited you the compromise of taking on basically 2/3 of utilities and 60% of rent is generous on your part.

Because you argue that your husband is not often home and it\u2019s like it\u2019s only 2 of you sharing the apartment (BS) then why don\u2019t you let her have the bigger room? Is it because there are two of you and you NEED the bigger room? So much for your argument.\n\nYou had an oral agreement on how to split the rent and she wants to change it because she now realizes how unfair it is. You can\u2019t justify it because \u201cwe had a deal\u201d when you admitted that it was inequitable before you moved in.

Makes sense that you and your husband should pay 2/3 of the utilities. But it does sound like the rent being 50:50 is still fair. \nWhy should you pay more because she decided to overextend her finances? That you two earn more has no bearing on what you should pay. \nTake time to think about what is fair in terms of the space.", "NTA. \nSister shouldn't have offered the original split.

You split living expenses 3 ways. Your relationship status is irrelevant here. \n\nYou may have an argument personally to pay less than the other two because you make significantly less than your husband and sister.  Many people living together split expenses proportionally to income so one person isn\u2019t paying most of their pay on expenses while the other is swimming in disposable income.", "Why is your income any kind of factor in how much rent to pay?  All the comments banging on about that seem whack to me. If I had a roommate no way in hell would they get me to pay more because I earn more.  You should pay your fair share. When it comes to utilities it matters. Each person uses utilities and therefore you and your husband should pay 2/3\n\nI would think the two of you should pay something more than her but less than 2/3 of the rent since your husband and your sister both use the spare room.  You all use all the common spaces, and you commented that sister uses half of the 4 bathrooms. \n\nAsk yourself this.  Would you find a comparable amount of space that you use for 800 a month, and is this all worth the fuss?   Would she go for 700 a month and 2/3 utilities?   I feel like an extra body should mean more in rent even if you are sharing a bedroom.  However what you earn should not be the reason you pay more. It should be all about how much you consume energy wise and space wise.  If you are taking up 2/3 of the space *some of the time* then maybe a little extra rent is appropriate?  Definitely the utilities should be split and you should go back over them and pay her for what you should have been paying all along.   \n\nI think ESH.  You and your husband for not paying 2/3 utilities from the get go, your sister for trying to get you to pay more because you earn more, and your parents for getting you all stirred up over a renegotiation that was between you and your sister. \n\nThe good news is if she decides to move out when the lease is up, you and your husband can find your own place and space and everyone will be happy.  Just try and keep from running to your parents about every little thing.  It sounds like she feels like you are the golden child and they always take your side.  How they could agree that half the utilities is remotely fair is beyond me.  The fact she wanted to get out from under them tells me there is something there and maybe you should take a good hard look at how much your parents might have favored you over the years.", "I was teetering between Y T A and E S H, but ultimately decided on ESH. \n\nOP and her husband = For agreeing to 50/50.

My partner and I also took showers together and our shared shower typically took as long as those of our solo roommate. These things aren't always as cut and dry as they look on paper.", "I agree with this completely.  More than half.  The 65% part sounded reasonable.  Slightly bigger bedroom, slightly more utility usage.  It may not be 1/3 1/3 1/3 since the couple shares space but it isn\u2019t 50/50 either.\n\nChanging after the fact made it a big deal.

Utility usage may also be vastly different if sister WFH full-time and the other two work outside the home. \n\nHonestly, I think it\u2019s ESH. Sister used the 50/50 split to entice the OP into a situation and a larger apartment than OP otherwise might have agreed to, and OP and her husband are crappy because, even with what I mentioned above, I don\u2019t think a 50/50 split was ever fair. \n\nI\u2019d say a probably complicated but most fair to everyone way of splitting it: figure out square footage of all bedrooms, and square footage of all common areas and express those as total percent of apartment\u2014ie bedroom space is 40% of rent, common areas are 60%, etc). Then, the percentage of square footage OP, OP\u2019s husband, and sister get (so if OP has 25% of bedroom space, and her share is 25% of the 40%, and do the same for husband and sister), then split common area into thirds, so OP and husband  end up paying 67% (66.6 rounded). \n\nI could be ok with 50/50 on utilities if sister is home more/it\u2019s justified. But I\u2019d say it should probably be closer to 60/40 at minimum (since OP seemed to acknowledge she is there frequently even if her husband isn\u2019t. \n\nSo as an example, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a 1400 square foot apartment, with 500 of it as bedroom space. Assuming (based on the edit for master and one bedroom) OP and her husband have the master, which is about 180 square feet (I\u2019ll just make the other two bedrooms the same size for ease\u2014so 160 square feet per).\n\nSo it would look something like this:\nTotal rent $1295\n\nBedroom space is ~36% of the apartment (or $466.20). \nOP gets 90 square feet or 18% of bedroom space=$83.92\nHusband gets 90+80 of the second room=170=34%=158.51\nSister gets 160+80=240=48%=223.77\n\nCommon areas $828.3/3=276.26 (with 0.01 left over so I mean, does that matter who pays?) \n\nOP would be assigned 83.92+276.26 (360.18)\nHer husband would be assigned 158.51+276.26 (434.77)\nAnd sister would be assigned 223.77+276.26 (500.03)\n\nThis ends up with sister ultimately paying ~38.3% of total rent, which is pretty close to the initial split I suggested for utilities.
