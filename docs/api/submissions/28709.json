My twin sister suggested that we all live together so that she can move out of our parents\u2019 house. At first, we were hesitant. However, we eventually agreed because it would be mutually beneficial. She found the place, a 3-bed at $1295/mo + utilities. When asking about how we would split up the rent + utilities, she said that she would split everything 50/50 with us. This is an agreement we came to a few months ago. \n\n2 weeks ago, we signed the lease + moved in. We agreed that my husband + I would share the larger bedroom, she would get one room, and she + my husband would share the spare room as a home office/gaming room. We were all getting along great until my sister approached me, explaining that after she\u2019s done some thinking, she no longer believes that our original agreement is fair because we make more money than she does. (For context, I make $29k/yr, my husband makes $55k/yr, and my sister makes $45k/yr). She proceeded to suggest that we pay 2/3 rent + utilities and that she pays 1/3.  I was caught off-guard by the conversation. I had to think about what she said and talk to my husband. I didn\u2019t want to argue with her or make her upset, so we negotiated down to us paying $800 while she pays $495 for rent and that we would pay 65% of utilities. I still didn\u2019t feel right about this, but I tried seeing it from her POV. \n\nThe next day, I spoke to my parents + my aunt about it. My parents + aunt both agreed that it was unfair for her to renegotiate now. After speaking with them, I realized that I needed to speak with her again + insist that we go back to our original agreement. I approached her that night saying that I knew we had discussed this, but the more I thought and talked with my husband (who also felt it was unfair), the more I felt it was unfair for her to go back on our original agreement. Before I could finish explaining my first thought, she began to interrupt + argue with me. She got upset and walked away from the conversation, saying that as soon as our lease was up (in 1 yr), she would find somewhere else to live. At this point, I was shocked at how upset and angry she became. I ended up leaving the house for a bit with my husband to chat when I received a call from my parents. \n\nThey explained that my sister had called them crying and yelling, saying that they needed to stay out of our business. She had the sentiment that she had been screwed over and that everyone was against her and taking my side. \n\nFor context, she just bought a new car (not out of necessity, she just wanted a newer one). My dad said that he tried discussing bills with her, but she insisted she could afford it easily. I feel guilty, but my family is telling me that I did the right thing by sticking up for myself. Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: This arrangement was my sister\u2019s idea from the beginning. She offered 50/50 split. If she told me she wanted me to pay more before, I would probably have chosen for my husband and I to live alone. Also, my sister uses two bathrooms (1 full, 1 half) out of the 4 (2 full, 2 half, the other half bath is downstairs for guests). My husband also works so much that it basically is like only me and her share the apartment most of the time.", "created_utc": 1697042503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175ilu4/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_more_rent/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re sister definitely shouldn\u2019t have tried to change the rent agreement after signing the lease nor should she have gotten mad when you said no. With that being said your current rent agreement is definitely not fair because she as an individual person is paying the same amount of rent as two people. You did the math on how much you and your husband would pay together if you split the rent 2/3 and 1/3 but you didn\u2019t think to break it down to show what you each pay individually. Currently you and your husband each pay around $324 in rent whereas your sister pays around $648. If you were to split it into you and your husband paying 2/3s of the rent. That means all three of you would be paying around $432 in rent. Yes for you and your husband it adds up to be over $800 together but if you consider it as your three individuals who all have their own income and are all paying for rent then splitting it into thirds is much more fair than splitting it in half but having two people contribute to one of those halves of rent.", "ESH - Your sister sucks for waiting until AFFTER the lease was signed to try and renegotiate how payment should be split. \n\nBut on the other hand, you suck for \u201cnot feeling right\u201d about splitting things fairly. You and your husband are two people. You take up more space and will ultimately use more utilities.\n\nYou all should have talked more before moving, but you and your husband should definitely be paying 2/3 rent and 2/3 utilities if you really want it to be fair. It has nothing to do with who makes more and everything to do with paying each person\u2019s fair share. You and your husband together are not one person, so you shouldn\u2019t be paying the same as one person.", "Bro your agreement is terribly unfair. You use 2/3rds of the bathroom and pay for half. You use 2/3rds of the fridge space and pay for half. 2/3rds of all the common areas, 2/3rds of the utilities, the only thing you actually \"split\" 50/50 is the bedrooms, and even then yours is larger! \n\n>My parents + aunt both agreed that it was unfair for her to renegotiate now.\n\nI guess, but it's an unreasonable split anyway and you should have seen this coming. Pay for what you use, don't expect your sister to subsidize your rent. \n\n>She had the sentiment that she had been screwed over\n\nOther than the fact that \"she agreed to it\" how is it remotely fair for her to pay for your living space? \n\nPersonally, I think that you now have to weigh whether or not you value your relationship with your sister, or whether you value the \"fairness\" of holding her to the unfair situation she agreed to originally. But most of all, I have to say, the fact that you haven't figured out that you're getting more than you pay for here makes me lean YTA.", "She should have started with the 2/3 from the beginning.\n\nYou are with 3 ppl so everyone pays 33% to make it fair.", "YTA. \n\nYou're 3 people sharing, all rent and bills should be split 3 ways. It's unfair for her to be paying 50% when you're only paying 25% each. So what if she has a new car- the money is not fair and equal.", "ESH\n\nShe should not have decided to change after you moved in. Had you known you\u2019d be paying 2/3, you and your husband may have said no. \n\nBut you should be paying more than half.", "YTA\n\nAgreeing to split it 50/50 makes no sense.  I'm not saying the answer should be 3 ways;  but not 50/50.  \n\nThink about it:  You & your partner use 2/3s of the uilties.  You get the largest bedroom (of the 2), with the third being equally shared.  Etc.\n\nNow, your sister realized this - brought it up to you.  You had a reasonable discussion - and honestly, what you came up - seemed like a reasonable compromise.  At this point, I don't think there are any assholes.\n\nNow, you go into asshole territory.\n\nThen, you went back on it after speaking to your parents/aunt - and presenting things from YOUR POV.  (not your sisters).  They agree with you, so you go back to your sister and dictate that.\n\nOf course she was pissed off.  You used the rest of your family to gang up on her - and from her perspective, likely poisoned the well (by presenting it from your POV).", "I think you and your husband pay 65% of the rent is fair as you use  the larger bedroom and share the extra room .\n\nI think you should pay 2/3 of the utilities because you are 2/3s of the users of the utilities.  No one is an AH. kt", "ESH, it should have been split 3 ways from the start.", "YTA, and this is why I\u2019d never live with a couple. It\u2019ll be 2v1 for every disagreement", "ESH.\n\nTwo thirds of the people, getting two thirds of the bedrooms, using two thirds of the utilities, should pay two thirds of the rent. YTA for thinking otherwise.  The Sister accepting one deal then demanding a change after things are agreed is also an AH.", "YTA. I am going to assume your sister agreed to this wildly unfair split because she was desperate to get out. Think about it: there are three people using utilities; she\u2019s contributing 1/3 of the usage and paying 1/2 of the bill. That\u2019s unfair. For all common areas, she is 1 of 3 people, once again being 1/3 of the use but paying 1/2 of the bill. You can argue the bedrooms are closer to even but even then you and your husband have the bigger one. \n\nI share a place with a sibling and my husband. Hubs is still waiting on his green card and can\u2019t work. I earn piss all, which is why I\u2019m here in the first place. Guess what, I pay 2/3 of the utilities because we together are 2/3 of the usage. We have rent split so the private areas that are legitimately split 50/50 are paid for 50/50 and the common areas are split 66/33 and I pay the bulk. Being a married couple makes you a unit in that you\u2019re both responsible for each other\u2026 not that you get to pretend you\u2019re only one person\u2019s worth of space and utilities and make your sister subsidize your life. \n\nShe should\u2019ve said it earlier and of course you were taken off guard by a change to the agreement, but the fact is the agreement you had is wildly unfair to your sister, you ARE screwing her over, and if you give a flying crap about her you should care about remedying that. You\u2019re being stupendously selfish by insisting on keeping to an agreement it\u2019s painfully clear to everyone on the outside looking in is forcing your sister to subsidize your life. Be better to her.\n\nEdit: Your parents are TA too for conflating continuing to take advantage of their other daughter as \u201csticking up for yourself.\u201d I see why she wanted to get away from them.", "YTA. I don't see how you two have convinced yourself that the original agreement was fair but I'm assuming greed has a lot to do with it. You get a two for one deal. She's subsidizing everything from the bigger bedroom to the showers you take.\n\nShe should've realized it earlier, but she is indeed being screwed over and the fact that her entire family are happy to do it *and* make judgmental digs at her spending at the same time really sucks for her. I'd be pretty pissed too.", "Yta. 3 ppl in the house, split bills 3 ways", "YTA. you are 2/3 of the household and should pay 2/3. It\u2019s not unfair for her to negotiate, it was unfair arrangement to begin with. It\u2019s not even about ya\u2019ll making more, even if she thinks it is. you are 2/3 of the residents.", "There\u2019s 2 of you so you should pay for 2/3 of groceries and utilities because you use more I guess, not sure about the rent though because you\u2019re both only using 1 and 1/2 bedrooms so aren\u2019t exactly taking up more space than her", "Meh. Her idea, suggestion etc. buying a new car she didn\u2019t need really tipped the scales for me. \n\nI\u2019m curious how much a 1-bed, 1-bath would cost her sister on her own. Good luck getting a place in most areas with that income and no roommates, unless you want to live in a shithole.", "YTA. I get that changing the agreement now is kind of crap, but it also doesn't make sense for her to pay the same as 2 people. It sounds like you're trying to take advantage of her.", "YTA.  \nThere's 2 of you, you get the bigger room, you two use up more utilities, but she has to pay HALF?\nYes, it sucks that she brought it up afterwards but she didn't realize how unfair this arrangement is until after you guys moved in. And if you actually care about your sister, you wouldn't screw her like that by making her pay more than her fair share.", "ESH. The original agreement should have been 2/3 and 1/3. You have the bigger room, you take up more water, electricity, etc. but you knew you were getting a good deal. Your sister screwed herself, and it's now too late to change the terms after everyone moved in.", "Might the wine talking, but NTA!!!\n\nReading through OP's comments, it's pretty clear the sister manipulated the situation so OP would agree.\nWhen OP was hesitant, the sister offered the 50/50 as a bargaining chip, that turned the tide and OP agreed.\nAfter the lease was signed, she rescinded on the agreement and OP is now expected to pay more than what she was comfortable with.\n\nHad the current arrangement been on the table, OP would not have accepted.\n\nI found it odd that everyone was siding with OP and not the sister, until I reas the comments.\n\nOP, this info needs to be in your post, not buried between comments.", "Rent should be split based on usage. You have the larger room? You should pay more. Utilities should 100% be split between all three of y'all. \n\nI think her changing after the fact sucks but it's all new so changes should be somewhat expected. \n\nWith two people I am assuming y'all use the common areas more than she does also", "YTA\n\nShe's 33% of the people in the house and she's paying for 50% of the house. You're taking advantage of her.", "If you don\u2019t agree to paying 2/3\u2013 I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re ready to pay 100% to living by yourself as a couple\u2014 you and your husband are AHs\u2026 your sister is a dumb AH\u2014 for doing business with family. Your extended family is an ESh\u2014 and you\u2019re an Ah second time for going to mommy and daddy to fix your problems", "ESH. The original agreement was unfair to your sister.

That is such bullshit. This looks like a clear bait and switch. She wanted to use you to move out of mom's house. This wasn't new information.\n\nOn the other hand, if three people are renting a place, shouldn't each pay 1/3 of common expenses?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean...I still have to land on NTA because a deal is a deal.", "NTA. \n\nThis was sisters idea.  I assume the sister was ok with the 50/50 split as a means to get out of the parents house.  Then she waited until a lease was signed and decided it wasn't fair?\n\nIt sounds like she used you for her needs, then tried to cry victim later.   \n\nI don't think it was a great agreement on her part, but sometimes if she is the person who needs the other side more, you take a less fair agreement to get the benefits  you are looking for.    I just don't think she didn't think of this before.", "NTA your sister is. She needs to honor her agreement or get out.

Your sister agreed to your original offer and is now suddenly changing her mind because she realizes you and your husband have more disposable income and can afford to pay more, all while she recently bought a new car. The original agreement was fair to everyone, and she shouldn't change it just because you and your husband make more than her, especially when she wasn't in a financial bind. If she's going to get this heated about the situation then it may be best if she finds somewhere else to live once your lease ends.", "Another clarification: this was my sister\u2019s idea, not ours.

If she needs to get out then you and your husband should let her out of her part of the lease.", "YTA. You are two people where she is one.

That\u2019s the agreement that makes the most sense. You should pay more bc the 2 of you will use most of the utilities and space.

She is your sister, operate with goodwill for her. Jeez.", "ESH... you both went back on your word. A twin thing?\n\nYou renegotiated after discussing it with your husband - that was the newest agreement \n\nYes, she was wrong to complain about the original deal but you renegotiated. \n\nSo you are equals in this mess. \n\nGo back to the last agreement and start looking for a new home once the lease is up", "All of you are pretty stupid imo. Not sure how you think it's fair to split it 50/50 when you 2 make double what she does and it's 3 people sharing a space. You and your husband aren't 1 entity. \n\nSounds like your sister was trying to move out ASAP and thought hey 50/50 sounds fair. She's an idiot in her own right but idk how you didn't look at the situation at face value and go \"my sister is getting hosed here\"", "ESH.  First off, trying to renegotiate and then getting that upset *after* the fact is poor form.  She agreed and even was the one to suggest it, so getting twisted later on is not really reasonable.  \n\nHowever, paying half when it's all three of you living there and you DO have the bigger bedroom is not fair to her even if she did agree in the first place.\n\nYou can make an argument that 2/3rds vs 1/3rd isn't a fair or reasonable split, but let's face it 50/50 is far less equitable than what shes asking.  You absolutely are taking advantage of your sister, and a compromise should be in order.  Even a 60/40 overall or 2/3rds on utilities would make it more balanced.", "ESH\n\nSplit was unfair to begin with IMO.  Each human counts in a shared living environment and should bare their share of the bills.  Sister should move someone in if she is paying 50% but only getting 1/3 of the value. \n\nYou took advantage of a good deal, and she realized her mistake and wanted to renegotiate. Another stellar example of why you should not live with friends or family unless it is a truly dire circumstance.", "I'm surprised at all the you being the asshole votes. I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nIn your defense OP, you made an agreement assuming that everyone was getting what they wanted. Your sister gets to move out of the house and live with roommates she knows, and you and your husband get to save on rent. Meanwhile, she has to sacrifice by paying more than her normal share of rent, and you two have to sacrifice by living with a roommate when you could live alone. That sounds like a reasonably fair tradeoff for both of you imo.\n\nThat said, if your sister hasn't lived out of the house, I can see why she would underestimate the cost and the resentment that would build from paying a disproportionally large amount. Now she's probably realizing it wasn't as good of a deal as she hoped it would be. If anything, it's more her fault for not predicting what she wanted and needed, but it's an understandable mistake for a young person to make. Although frankly, you should ALSO have recognized this highly likely issue and addressed it in advance.\n\nIn my opinion, you should both renegotiate to a slightly fairer balance. If you cannot come to a compromise, then you should contact the landlord and try to get out of the lease (which is usually no issue, especially if you help find a replacement tenant).", "She\u2019s not wrong. The agreement is unfair to her. Utilities should definitely be split by thirds. Since she has access to the spare room you have an argument for rent being 60/40 but it really should be in thirds as well.\n\nHowever she bait and switched you guys by paying 50% to get you guys to agree to being roommates so she could move out. \n\nConsidering she baited you the compromise of taking on basically 2/3 of utilities and 60% of rent is generous on your part. NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe has 1,5 rooms, you have 1,5 rooms. So it should be 50/50. And you would have to pay 2/3 of the utilities to make it fair. Stick with that, or live without her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr offer for her to pay 1/3, but she loses the use of the hobby room.", "It sounds like the bedroom decision was made after the payment decision. Because you argue that your husband is not often home and it\u2019s like it\u2019s only 2 of you sharing the apartment (BS) then why don\u2019t you let her have the bigger room? Is it because there are two of you and you NEED the bigger room? So much for your argument.\n\nYou had an oral agreement on how to split the rent and she wants to change it because she now realizes how unfair it is. You can\u2019t justify it because \u201cwe had a deal\u201d when you admitted that it was inequitable before you moved in.

My husband and I share one bedroom. My sister gets one bedroom. The third bedroom is a shared space for my sister and my husband. The rest of the house is shared equally among all of us.", "But the non-monetary benefits are being considered as well. The sister is able to move out of the house and live with roommates she knows, rather than having to stay at home or live with randos. This is a large benefit to the sister that could totally be worth the unbalanced rent split.  Meanwhile OP and husband have to share with a roommate when they otherwise wouldn't have to, so they're making a sacrifice that might be worth it to save on rent.", "I agree the agreement is unfair to the sister but I can\u2019t say OP is T A bc it really looks like the sister baited them so she could move out.", "Regardless of whether OP should or should not be paying more is irrelevant.\n\nIf the information is correct as stated, then it was OP's sister who suggested and agreed to a 50/50 split.

Everything after that was OP acting unreasonable and dragging other people in to harass her sister on her behalf. \n\nYTA OP. Two people should be paying for two people, not one. She\u2019s your sister, not your business partner. She made a mistake (and so did you, FWIW), and it\u2019s reasonable to try and correct that mistake. What is not reasonable is dragging other people into it and harassing her about it as a group. That\u2019s poor behavior, at best.", "I can see how you\u2019d think that. However, I only discussed it with them to get their feedback and see if I was in the wrong for feeling how I felt. Although everybody has bias, I felt I presented the situation in as objective a way as possible. I wasn\u2019t purposefully saying anything to make her look like the bad guy.

It was only my sister and I talking together so it wouldn\u2019t feel like we were ganging up on her.", "Your username is fitting here, her sister is an adult and should advocate for herself. Maybe it is unfair, but sister should have considered this beforehand.", "I was actually in a similar situation. 2 bedrooms with a couple. They changed the rent to 50/50, which meant that they both were paying less. They offered no other compromise to me to balance it out. I found that to be very unfair. They made more than me combined and were each paying half of what I paid. If they pay more rent, sis should at least do more utilities or something to even it out.\n\nThis makes sense in my head, but sometimes when it makes sense in my head, it doesn't actually make sense to others. So yea.", "She would likely be unable to afford anywhere on her own, which is part of the reason why we agreed to the arrangement.", "I disagree.  It sounds like all of this was the sisters idea.  Then she waited until a contract was signed to try to change the deal.  That is shitty.  IF this was a problem, she should have thought about that before signing a lease", "How would that be the case if sister did establish/advocate for a fairer arrangement beforehand? Sounds to me like her car payment is too high and HER finances changed", "NTA. Sister is an adult and should have prepared a more favorable arrangement beforehand. You cannot change the terms after the agreement. OP also mentions the purchase of a new vehicle, which to me sounds like her financial situation changed and THEN she wanted to change the arrangement", "I added an edit to the post. Sorry, this my first Reddit post and had to condense a lot of my original thoughts due to the character limit !!", "We lived alone in an apartment with higher rent which we paid on our own before moving. I didn\u2019t go to them to fix the issue, and they didn\u2019t go and speak to her. I went to them for advice, and she reached out to them of her own accord because she was upset.", "I agree, a deal is a deal.  that's why she is YTA.\n\n> , so we negotiated down to us paying $800 while she pays $495 for rent and that we would pay 65% of utilities. I still didn\u2019t feel right about this, but I tried seeing it from her POV.\n\nThey made a new deal.  Now she's going back on it", "You\u2019re still two people to her one. It\u2019s not just the bedrooms that need to be taken into consideration when it comes to rent it\u2019s the entire apartment as a whole and with you and your husband being two out of the three people living there you use up 2/3 of the overall space. So why should your sister pay half the rent when she\u2019s not using as much of the space because she\u2019s only one person and you and your husband are two people", "You\u2019re still two people. She is one. You and your husband share a room because you choose to. (And obviously you\u2019d choose too, I think most people would), but ultimately that\u2019s really not the point. You and your husband are two people. She is one person. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nThink of it like this: You\u2019re responsible for 1/3 of everything, your husband is responsible for 1/3 of everything, and your sister is responsible for 1/3 as well. You and your husband can decide  how you two split up the parts your responsible for however you want, but that shouldn\u2019t affect her cost. Her paying 1/3 of everything is still fair.", "A common 3 person split where 2 are a couple is 60/40. It\u2019s not as fair that you have to share a bedroom but all common areas are split.\n\nESH because it should have been easily foreseen by everyone how unfair the 50/50 balance is, but no one did bring it up until after the fact.", "OP is in the comments acting like the two of them don't use 2/3 of the common areas, utilities, etc. If OP could admit to and own the fact that the original arrangement was completely unfair I might agree with you but OP is acting like she and her partner are only one person and as if a 50/50 split is justified! It's one thing to say sister should hold to the original deal, but another thing entirely to try and claim that the original deal was somehow \"fair\"", "I read it as the sister and OP's husband were sharing the last one.\n\n>she + my husband would share the spare room", "> My husband and I share one bedroom. My sister gets one bedroom.\n\nYeah, that's close to a 50/50 split, except you said your bedroom is larger.\n\n>The rest of the house is shared equally among all of us.\n\nExactly! You and your husband are two people, not one. So you and he make up 2/3rds of the use of the living room. You and he make up 2/3rds of the use of the bathroom. You and he make up 2/3rds of the use of the kitchen, etc. etc. And yet for all of those spaces, you're only paying for half.", "Two people still use more utilities than one person and you have the biggest room", "How is that not splitting spaces?", "Agreed. She should have said that from the beginning. It was the agreement. \n\nBut OP could have predicted that eventuality.", "Here is the thing:  I don't buy it.  What you were planning (in the beginning) made no sense.  Again, I'm not saying it had to be exactly 66 / 33 - but the idea that it was 50 / 50?  I don't get it.\n\nNow, maybe if she got the two smaller rooms - and you got the master, i could sent being 50/50, and utilities 66/33.\n\nMy point here is - I feel like a reasonable person looking at this, with no bias, would realize the original agreement was unfair.  And as you've now made a compromise with your sister - going back it was being a complete asshole.\n\nSo the fact your family is 100% backing you,  makes me think you absolutely did give it somewhat biased.  \n\nAlso, the fact you agreed, and then are going back on it (after talking to your parents, as you are an adult), if I was your friend - I'd lose massive respect for you, and it would possibly jeopardize our friendship.  As a sibling/twin, well, I'm not even sure what to say.  (I'm an only child, so I can't really relate).\n\nIt's a shitty thing to do", "YTA for getting the rest of your family involved. You\u2019re an adult, don\u2019t make a deal with your sister and then go running to mom. And your sister was right, she never should have been paying half.", "That\u2019s the lenses I\u2019m looking through. \n\nHer idea and probably thought she\u2019d get the best of both worlds. Then the bills come due. \n\nDid you furnish the apartment besides her room? \n\nI had a roommate before marriage that was so excited to only pay for rent only with a nicely redone and fully furnished place (nice stuff) ($745/month which was TV, Internet, in-unit washer and dryer etc).\n\nHe got pissed on the imbalance (I was paying $600) so I welcomed him to leave if he found something the same or better. \n\nHe\u2026did\u2026not. Obviously family is different but people will 99% play the victim until people stop listening.\n\nContext: I was living with a friend who moved for school. I could have afforded by myself. 2 doors over he would have paid 1200 for a studio that was the size of his bedroom", "Considering, by OP's statement that it was her sister's idea and suggestion of a 50/50 split, then it solely falls on her sister being the asshole. Not OP.", "Adults aren't exempt from making poor decisions sometimes. She didn't think it through but it's an AH move from the OP and her husband to even agree to a 50/50. It's not a fair arrangement (regardless of whether theres a new car or not)", "That doesn't change much. At a minimum you need to be splitting utilities into thirds, and she really ought to be responsible for less rent with a smaller bedroom.\n\nI agree that she should have brought this up earlier, but your first agreement was lopsided.", "oooh yes my bad! i only read that her husband would take it as a home office", "True, but they also aren't exempt from living with the consequences of them.", "Cool, work on your reading comprehension then and go back and edit your comment...", "Sure, but it's still an AH move from the OP. I just can't imagine screwing someone I love like that"]}
