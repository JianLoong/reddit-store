I'm wondering, what course were you taking in college and how well were you doing when they stopped paying?\n\nI'm suspecting you don't need a degree to take over their business and they were trying to force you to take something hoping you'd fail or give up and be 'stuck' with the only good prospect being taking over their business. Maybe they hoped that you'd accept way lower pay for taking over the business while they retired and took an unfair amount of money out of your work.\n\nEither way sounds like a complete control thing where they were trying to force you down the route they wanted without a single care what you wanted in your life.\n\nThey can hire ANYONE to manage their company when they retire. You're better off without them. Them stopping paying tuition and refusing to answer why is just, weird.", "There using financial manipulation to try to control you. Good for you for breaking free. NTA", "NTA. They tried to control you, then cut off the support you anticipated even after doing what they demanded. When you pivoted because they didn't hold up their end of the bargain, they basically threatened you. And then they moved to an entirely separate country, which you learned of only through others. You were abandoned by toxic parents, not the other way around. Enjoy your life, good riddance to them."]}
