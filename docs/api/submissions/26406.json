Everything you write indicates they are completely unaware of the toxicity of how you're treated and expected to respond to that treatment. And as such, they're currently (possibly permanently) unable to address it. Tolerating it long enough to establish a solid foundation for your future, then separating yourself from them/the emotionally abusive situation they've immersed you in, is pretty much your best option. It will either force them to recognize what untenable circumstances they forced on you, or at least get you safely away and leave them with no one to vent their spleen on but each other. \n\nGood luck, OP. Never doubt that you DO NOT deserve this treatment, and you can do better. Get yourself some queer friends if you can.
