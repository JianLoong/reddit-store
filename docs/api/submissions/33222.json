For background, my younger sister (10F) has got ADD and dyslexia. Because of that, I've always been forced into the background, for example, I had to deal with my insomnia at nine alone: I begged and sobbed for my parents nearly every night so they would stay with me and try and help me fall asleep, but they didn't, while my sister is ten and said parents still stay in her room for at least 30 minutes or more until they make sure she falls asleep. This was only one example of the many other ones, but I won't go into too much detail.\n\nAs you can guess, I've grown some kind of resentment towards my sister\u2014 I have had straight As (5s, in my country) in my first six years of school, and I still only get 4s and 5s only, while my sister is barely passing, and yet, my parents only push me.\n\nOn the second of December, I did my complex language exam. And now, on December 14th, the results came out, and I got 97%, which is amazing, judging by the fact that I'm only fourteen, and English is not my first language (it's Hungarian.) I have been asking my parents to go to my favourite restaurant, but since it is a bit pricy, and even though we're very well-off, a dinner for three would cost around 70,000 HUF, which is 199 USD. I thought that me passing my language exam and getting such a great score was a great opportunity to celebrate at that restaurant, but I made a request to my parents: I want to go alone with them, my little sister excluded. I didn't experience any undivided attention since I was only four, and I wanted to have a simple 'only child experience' for once, where my sister isn't in the spotlight for either her disabilities, or that she finally got a B in Math class (which is rare.) \n\nOn a family lunch, hosted at my grandmother's, the subject of my language exam popped up. My relatives congratulated me, then came the topic of where we would celebrate. I said the usual, a dinner or lunch at my favourite restaurant, only the three of us. My parents and most relatives got very angry at me, saying that I can't exclude my sister. I don't understand though, cause it was me who accomplished such a thing, and it's obvious that my sister won't even be able to graduate high school. So, why should I invite someone I don't like (loathe, to be exact) to celebrate something *I* alone accomplished? For further info, my parents didn't help me revise for the exam, I did everything alone.\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting my sister to come with me and my parents to my language exam celebration?", "created_utc": 1702817297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kgnnu/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_to_attend_my/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think your anger towards your sister is misdirected - it's your parents that have created this dynamic, not your sister. Does your sister have somewhere she could go if you went with your parents to dinner? Your parents don't sound like they will budge either way. \n\nAlso, have you heard the phrase \"glass child\"?", "You are completely justified in your feeling left out from what you describe, but it seems you believe achieving in school and trying to outshine/exclude your sister (an innocent party in this) is going to force your parents to redirect their attention. You should get more attention from your parents, but when you pose it as its either me or her, it makes it impossible for your parents to choose. NTA, but your parents response is also reasonable.\n\nPerhaps you can share with your parents exactly how you feel (Because at the root of your resentment is probably not your sister, but how your parents treat your sister and you). You can explain that it is not that you want to actively exclude and hurt your sister, but that you miss the attention and quality time with them. \n\nProbably your parents will want to celebrate all together if it is such a fancy place, as otherwise it will really hurt your sister's feelings. So it doesn't have to be this time, but you can ask in the near future for a quality time outing with one of your parents.", "Honestly I don't think a 14 year old would really understand the situation. You are right from your perspective.\n\nBut once you grow up you will realise the only people who are at fault are your parents. They don't really understand that blatantly favouring one child for her condition and neglecting the other one has some serious consequences.The only asshole in this situation are your 'parents' who need some serious parenting classes.", "First of all, congratulations on the exam \ud83d\udc4d! \n\nPlease don\u2019t take this out on your sister as she has done nothing wrong. Try talking to your parents about your feelings in an honest and open way. \n\nIt would be a bit cruel to exclude your sister from the dinner and would not help the situation you describe.", "Congratulations for your result!\nI can see where both perspectives came from: you need and are entitled to alone and quality time with your parents, but a celebration meal should be with whole family. Maybe instead of just getting angry at you, your parents may have come up, with a compromise: lunch/dinner with the four of you and some activity that you and one of your parents at time can enjoy alone.\nNAH, but about the way they treat you your parents are a little TA: you should resent them instead of your special needs sister", "NTA, but borderline ESH.\n\nIt\u2019s fair that you want to have some time with your parents dedicating their attention to celebrating you. Unfortunately, excluding your sister isn\u2019t the way to get it.\n\nYour sister is not the cause of your parents\u2019 favouritism. Your parents are. So excluding your sister won\u2019t get you what you want. It\u2019s only going to hurt your sister and make your family pressure you to involve her, ruining your big day in a different way.", "NAH. You want to have you parents to yourself, which is entirely reasonable. When I was little, my sister and I would go for 'alone excursions' with our mother: just me and mother, or just my sister and mother. We both understood what an 'alone excursion' meant. There was no resentment.\n\nI think that enforcing this particular celebration without your sister is a little harsh--it's not her fault, and it's nice to reinforce the idea that an accomplishment from one of you means celebration for both--but I think you might ask your parents about the idea of an alone excursion. One day a month (or whatever) you get them to yourself, and one day a month your sister gets them to herself--not for reasons of her disabilities, but just because alone time with one's parents is a nice thing for a sibling to have.", "Honey, you are blaming the wrong person here. Everything you wrote is *your parents* fault, I don't see where your sister has actually done anything wrong.\n\n*Your parents* favor her.\n\n*Your parents* neglect you.\n\nShe's just kind of there doing her own thing.\n\nI think therapy would be helpful, though I'm not convinced that your parents would care enough to get you in with someone. \n\nThe fact is that they are *bad parents*, and honestly, they are harming *both* of their kids. You are being ignored, neglected, and basically forced to grow up on your own, but with the way they are coddling her, she may never be independent. \n\nYou are NTA, but neither is your sister. Your parents are.", "Children have feelings that some adults whould say are ugly and wrong. Most adults have a lot of wrong and ugly feelings and most of adulds tend to use fake smiles, politeness and gaslighting to not show them. \n\nChildren are honest about their ugly feelings which is great, because then we as adults can help children understand and resolve these feelings. \n\nOn the side i believe your family is wrong to shut you up and just yell at you that you have these feelings. \n\nListen, you need to talk to an adult who is someone you trust and has outside view of your family. Talk and vent all you want and with time your ugly feelings whould reaolve and you will learn how to manage your emotions better. \nThe most important is DONT STOP BEING HONEST ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL!!\n\nand good job on the hard work you have done, dont grow up too fast be a kid.", "NTA but neither is your sister. She can't help having disabilities and she isn't responsible for your parents behaviour. \n\n'my sister is barely passing, and yet, my parents only push me.'\n\nI'd say this is actually the one thing your parents are getting right - at least they recognise that you're smart and should aim high.", "ESH, except the sister.  It is ok to have these feelings, it seems like your parents haven\u2019t done a good enough job of showing individual love and attention to you while also raising your sister who has some special needs.  \n\nIt is natural to want to do things by your self with your parents, I make sure both my kids get alone time with me along with our family activities, and I think that\u2019s what you want the most.   \n\nI think where you went wrong was your delivery, and how you insulted your sister for things she cannot control.  This is your parents issue, not hers.  \n\nMy biggest suggestion is to tell your parents how you really are desiring some alone time with them, but do it in a way without insulting your little sister.  \n\nBest of luck", "A very kind and gentle YTA. \nCongratulations on the exam, and you do deserve to celebrate!\nHowever, your resentment is misdirected. The reason you were neglected was not your sister, but your parents and their inability/unwillingness to be there for you. Your sister did no wrong, and she's family, and she doesn't deserve to be excluded. Plus if I'm reading this correctly, your parents are the ones making everything about your sister, she's not being attention seeking or mean (in which case wanting to exclude her would be fair)\nPlus, on a more practical note, your parents would make everything about her regardless of if she's there or not, so if you want a celebration where you're a priority, I'd suggest maybe celebrating with friends or having a solo day out where you are doing things you enjoy, instead of enjoying with your parents who don't seem to care that much about you. \nAlso, I do understand where you're coming from, as an older sibling. I have a little brother who got a lot more attention than me, and I did hate him for that when I was your age. It happens. But I hope one day you do see that your sister has very little to do with everything.", "Congrats on your result! \n\nI understand what you're feeling and why: key here is how they way your parents looked after you and your sister has caused the resentment you feel towards your sister. \n\nIt is very clear why you see your sister as the cause for your emotions; however your parents have allowed this to happen. \n\nESH, because it's not your sister's fault that she is how she is and your parents treat her as such, but your feelings are also very very valid and you should also have had quality time with them.\n\nIf you haven't felt able before, express your feelings to your parents (or another trusted parental figure first, if you feel nervous about it), to explain how you feel fully and openly. Hopefully you can have the celebration you'd like and your sister can be taken care of.\n\nI feel for you. Be proud of yourself no matter what happens! It's a great achievement :)", "Honestly nta because if your parents didnt favor one child then you probably wouldn't mind her being there but since they dont do anything with you they have made you resent her", "Your parents need to realize that they have been neglecting you... \n\nCongratulations on your examination \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89", "adhd isn't something she can turn off and she's not responsible for the way your parents manage it.\n\nI have one son with ADHD and one son with mild ASD, and the ASD kid just needs more time and support.\n\nYTA for excluding from a whole-family celebration.\n\nWhat I do for my kids are one-parent rewards/outings.", "NTA for me. Your sister did nothing that deserve to be rewarded. She is 10 already, she needs to know how to work to earn sth and also needs to know that she isn\u2019t an only child. Your parents neglect you too much. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t ask for a celebration meal, I would ask for that 70,000HUF to buy whatever I want. If they give the same amount to their favorite girl, then they\u2019re dead to me the moment I got a job and can live on my own. I won\u2019t need parents that always neglect me and put their golden child before me.", "YTA - you don't resent your sister, you resent your parents. Your sister has done nothing wrong.", "Sorry but this is a parent problem nota sister problem", "YTA. You need to talk to someone about your resentment towards your sister. Because it should really be directed at your parents. Except you\u2019re still groveling at their feet hoping for some sort of approval from them. You and your sister are not in competition. You\u2019re just experiencing life differently. I\u2019m sorry your parents don\u2019t give you the attention you deserve but don\u2019t hate your sister for it. Take your sister to dinner with you. And enjoy that time with her.", "YTA\n\nWhat exactly do you think your parents will do with your 10 year olds sister while you are out celebrating? Should she sit in the car?\nMaybe palm her off on your grandparents?\n\nFamily celebrations are for family and this will be true until you\u2019re an adult.\nBoth children will always go to celebrations because you are a family.\nWhen you are an adult and out of home it might be different but right now you are trying to exclude a child who you have no right to be jealous of.\n\nIf you want to be angry at someone, be angry at your parents. They are the ones deciding how much attention each of you gets.\nIt\u2019s not your sister\u2019s fault.", "YTA\n\nWhat you're describing is not your sisters fault, so punishing her for it is aimed at the wrong person.\n\nAlso YTA for saying \"it's obvious that my sister won't even be able to graduate high school\", like she's 10, you have no idea what will happen in the next 8 years.

I myself am 15 you are allowed to have to spotlight on you alone it's not a freaking crime. And the fact you resent your sister if totally fine tbh. Your 14 not a adult. \nI do hope in the future your parents do realize what they did to you and you realize you miss placed the guilt.\n\nYou can't be the asshole in this situation your", "The gentlest of ESH, sorry.\n\nI think you need to separate out the issues with the language exam and how you feel about your sister if you want any sort of long term change. In the end imo, I think you're probably going to have to accept your sister going to the meal - it's just not worth it to make your hill to die on regarding this topic. Since it's is such an expensive place, your parents are probably thinking they don't want to have to spend that money only for one child to miss out when they can easily include both.\n\nBut I also think it's definitely worth having an honest conversation with your parents where you express what's going on and how you feel - tell them about the insomnia and everything, and try to push for it that once a month or similar you do get that one on one time that you need and deserve so you don't feel so left out, even if it's with one parent rather than both. That's going to make a lot more of a difference than one meal can.\n\nOn a side note, from your post I get the vibe that you're putting a lot of your self worth on your ability to get these high grades, and yes, they're great, and I completely understand focussing on that when you feel like your parents aren't making you feel valued in the way that you want and need, but for your own sake, please try and unlearn that you inherently have more value because you're getting higher grades. Not only because it isn't particularly kind to your sister (you probably don't see how much work she's putting into getting that B and what your parents are telling her when you're not around), but mostly for your own sake. At some point, whether it's at graduating exams or university, you're going to hit a point where your natural intelligence may not be enough, and if you put all your self worth on being the one that gets top grades, that's going to be a LOT harder to deal with than if you unlearn it while you're still doing well.", "NTA.\n\nIt is okay to want solo time with your parents, disability or not that should be the norm for every family with more than a kid.\n\nBut it is important for your mental health that you understand that she isn\u2019t at fault, your parents are. They are the one choosing to not have solo time with you and all the other favoritism.", "you're the asshole\n\nThe adult in me wants to be very gentle and calm and explain why you should have more compassion for your sister, she is your family, and she has different needs than yours. Talking to an adult you trust wouldn't be a bad idea either, if they have guidance councilors in your school, they could help you sort through your feelings so you can talk to your parents about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut then the other part of me is going to call you a spoiled brat who needs to grow up a little bit, 14 is old enough to understand that you aren't superior to anyone else, regardless of how good your grades are.
