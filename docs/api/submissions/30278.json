My oldest being (14F),Second oldest(10M),3rd oldest(7F),and my youngest being (3F). Me and my Ex-Wife left on good terms and she still sees the kids every few weeks but I have full custody.\n\nNow,I met my now Fianc\u00e9 (we will call her Amy) around 1 1/2 years ago and I introduced her to my kids about 4 weeks ago. She was very kind to all of my children but wasn't giving as much attention to my 10 year old (we will call him Blake). He has autism,not a bad case but it can get a little tough at times and he is going to therapy to help control it but besides that it seemed as if Amy didn't communicate with him as much when he also has speech issues. His words aren't always correct and we've been working on it but its a slow process. She did try communicating with him but got frustrated when he couldn't say some words properly and I understood her frustration, especially when you genuinely are trying to understand him but can't. I brushed it off because I figured she would keep trying and maybe help him out but it was the complete opposite. She ignored him basically, she loved my other kids,she took my oldest shopping,got ice cream with my 7&3 year old but hadn't done anything with Blake. I started to notice this happening more often than normal do I pulled her aside and asked her if she would try to communicate with him,she agreed and did it! Basically 2 weeks ago I asked my kids what they thought about me proposing to Amy,they were all so excited and were thrilled about the idea of having a mom again,especially Blake because I know he struggles with not having a mom.\n\nI proposed to her and she agreed,we told our family and had a big celebration dinner with both of our families. We were all doing toasts so when it was her turn she said something along the lines of \"Im so happy to have such a beautiful Fianc\u00e9 and beautiful children\" and it wasn't her speech that was the problem but it was how she said Blake. Basically she was naming all of my children like Abigail,Blake..., Yk? I was annoyed with how she said his name so I asked her why she said it like that and she said \"Ohit didnt mean it that way! I just don't like his speech issues and social anxiety\". I hated this comment and asked why she would say such a thing and that might not seem that bad but I mainly hated how she said it. I told her I was leaving and I would call her in a few days. My family was confused and I explained the situation to them in the family gc and they said I was overreacting and I need to suck it up and that Blake's speech issues need serious help and it doesn't seem like I'm doing anything to better the situation. I ended up blocking everyone and haven't spoke to them or Amy since then.

Did you propose because you love her or because you want your kids and especially Blake to have a mom again? \n2. Was your fianc\u00e9 aware about Blake's issues and the steps you re taking in order to help him? \n3. Why propose so soon after meeting your kids?\n\nI think you threw her in the deep...it s one thing to tell someone about another person's health problems and another to actually witness it amd to have to deal with it. Did you ever discussed with her what is expected from her? \n\nAnd dont forget, she accepted after meeting your kids, ALL 4 of them.\nMaybe you re not sure she is the one and you re projecting...she has never had the chance to bond with them...going shopping once and get them ice cream, doesnt tick the box.\n\nFor now YTA", "You are a single parent to 4 kids, one with special needs. Before getting engaged you absolutely needed to be sure they were 100% on board with your situation. She isn\u2019t. So she has no business being in your life. \n\nSo no you aren\u2019t wrong for ending the engagement. But frankly you shouldn\u2019t have been engaged to her to begin with. Plus how did you date her for a year and a half without her even meeting your kids. You need to see how someone is around your kids before you fall in love of whatever. \n\nAs for the comment your parents made\u2026is there any truth to it?  Is Blake getting all his needed therapy?  Could you be doing more?\n\nAlso who was watching your kids during the year and half that you were dating?", "How exactly did she say Blake? You put dots at the end but what does that mean, she dragged it out, maybe lowered her tone?", "Your family gives terrible advice man, who says \"suck it up\" and leave people mistreats your child because he is disable\n\nYour priority is to provide a safe environment for ALL your children.  Listen to your intuition, OP. Something is not right, and it's better to take action now. Put the wedding on hold and talk to your fianc\u00e9e. There are courses and classes for parents with children with autism that she might consider taking to better understand Blake. But if you believe she won't change, cancel the wedding.", "YTA. \n\nShe met the kids four weeks ago. It was much too soon to propose for the kids sake. They all need to get to know each other and a year ago you should have started laying the foundation for what Blake needs, how her communicates, etc. Also your whole \"the kids are excited to get a new mom\" portion is gross. They have a mom who is in their lives. Amy would not be their new mom, especially after a month. It seems like you are seeking someone to take care of your kids and there are nannies for that. No need to get married.", "Listen, you are and always will be  Blake's biggest advocate. If he is getting treatment and services then his speech issues will work out in time. But also know thay not everyone has experience working with children with disabilities.  Trust your gut, but also talk to her, express your feelings. Ask Blake and the other kiddos how they feel. Also, immediately blocking family because they didn't agree with you is not ok. Maybe they didn't hear what you heard. Again communication is important.", "YTA. \n\nSide note: I would lay $10 on a bet that says Amy is between the ages of 23-29. This based on what OP claims Amy said and Amy's behavior, but also...as this sub goes...the \"over 40 single dads\" all seem to want a young hot piece, to be their trophy and take over the kids. \n\nOnwards:\n\nWaiting over a year to intro the kids - GREAT! Thank you for not into'ng them until you had built a little history with her HOWEVER was Blake's condition a surprise to Amy? In over a year of dating, you never mentioned the issues? Never discussed your childrearing stress and joys? No \"hey hey, lemme show you a cute video of my kids\" so she might know what she is getting into? \n\nProposing 4 weeks later - CRAZY!", "Well... it's your decision to make, but finding a decent, caring woman to take on co-parenting 4 step kids, one of whom is special needs, is going to be a hunt for a unicorn. You are fully entitled to be as finicky as you want, but many women are not going to touch your situation with a 10 foot pole. Dropping her as an SO for insufficient expressed enthusiasm for parenting a demanding child vs working with her on this is your call, but there is unlikely to be a line of women seeking to replace her in this role. Good Luck.", "Sounds like you are the typical \u201cmy kids are my world\u201d sole parent.. I\u2019d be giving the same advice to her if the genders were reversed.. run", "Ehh, the obviously you\u2019re just looking for someone to be Mum to your kids. nAH here but I hope Amy takes the hint and runs. \n\nWho is with someone for 18th the before introducing their kids to them, and then two weeks post intro proposes? And how did you and Amy ever date if you have full time custody of all these kids? Is Amy a co-worker? This is all very weird.", "NTA, as a parent of a special needs child, it's your job to trust your gut. You need a partner who will accept that child and, in fact, all your children for who they are and for who they are not. He can not help being autistic. It comes with its own challenges and strengths, and he will need someone who loves and supports him through his journey.", "You just introduced your kids to her and in four weeks you proposed? In what way did you think that was a smart move? You know nothing about this person. You don\u2019t know how she reacts to your kids throwing tantrums, puking during the night, being exhausted and having to cook for everyone, loud kids in the car etc. You proposed without any real life experience with her and the kids. Are you lonely? Low self esteem? Like why the rush?", "No, you are not the asshole for refusing to marry your fianc\u00e9 after the comment she made towards your son. It is understandable that you would be upset and hurt by her comment, especially since it seems like she was dismissive and unsympathetic towards your son's struggles. It is important for your fianc\u00e9 to recognize the impact of her words and apologize sincerely. Until then, it is appropriate to take time to reflect on whether this is a relationship you want to continue. It is also concerning that your family dismissed your feelings and criticized your parenting of your son's speech issues. It may be helpful to seek support from a therapist or a support group for parents of children with disabilities to help you navigate these complex family dynamics and advocate for your son", "I just don\u2019t want Blake to have a stepmom who treats him like garbage. My stepmother treated us horribly. I still wonder what my life could have been without her. 60 years later, I think of what she did every day.", "Trust your gut, my guy.

NTA\n\nTrust your gut when it comes to these things.  As a parent of an autistic child, you also carry a good likelihood of being on the spectrum.  And one characteristic of autism is being very perceptive. It's almost a superpower.  Minor things like the tone with which people say things can go unnoticed by many, but we clock it.  It's a tell.  People might tell you that you're oversensitive, but then they go on to say they never thought so and so would do such a thing when you kinda knew all along that person was shady. \n\nDon't make that mistake with a spouse.  \n\nYour son has special needs, which means you do, too, in terms of a partner, willing to take on everything that your family entrails.
