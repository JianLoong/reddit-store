I met him when he was *talking* to my sister\u2019s friend (21F).\n\nMy sister\u2019s friend found out she was pregnant with his child, and after trying to make a healthy relationship work they eventually called it quits. They both say that they work a lot better as friends than lovers, and I agree. She was completely fine with me dating him, and I was okay with her being pregnant by him. I\u2019m sure it was comforting to know *I* wasn\u2019t going to cause any cat fights over her pregnancy. My sister is also very excited because she was asked to be the godmother of the baby. Things seemed to be going well for all of us. I was happy in my relationship, and my sister\u2019s friend\u2019s pregnancy was going healthily. She allowed my fianc\u00e9 and I both to attend doctor appointments to see our future baby, and she agreed to let us both be in the delivery room when the baby comes. \n\nThen she started to exclude me. \n\nSF (Sister\u2019s friend) asked my fianc\u00e9 to come to a doctors appointment, but asked not to bring me. I was very hurt at first, but I understood. Then this started happening more and more often. I was excluded from the doctor\u2019s appointment where they found out the gender, and I\u2019ve been excluded from all of the birthing classes. Anytime I\u2019ve tried to bring this up to my fianc\u00e9 he tells me that it\u2019s up to her who she allowed at her medical appointments. He suggested that I talked to her.  The next time I saw her was tonight at my sister and SF\u2019s home for my sister\u2019s birthday dinner. I planned to talk to her after dinner alone, but after a couple glasses of wine things slipped out. I asked her if I did something to upset her. I explained her to that I\u2019m feeling left out of my step-child\u2019s pregnancy, and I was wondering if there was a reason. She got physically upset, and told me that her pregnancy is none of my business. My sister tried to calm the situation by changing the subject, but SF couldn\u2019t let it go. She went on and on how I shouldn\u2019t feel entitled to attend any of her appointments because it\u2019s not my baby. I brought up the fact that this will also be my child because I\u2019m marrying the father, and she should be happy that her child will have a bonus mom.She stormed out of the house, and left the three of us at a very awkward place. My sister blew up at me telling me that I need to apologize. I told her that I have nothing to apologize for because I haven\u2019t done anything wrong, and it just seems like SF wants to use this baby to get back with my fianc\u00e9. My sister asked us to leave, and the drive home was just as awkward as it was at the house. I asked my fianc\u00e9 if he thinks she still likes him, and all he could do is roll his eyes and tell me I\u2019m acting like an asshole. I also got a text from my sister telling me that if I don\u2019t apologize to her friend she isn\u2019t going to allow me back in their home.\n\nDo you think I\u2019m being an asshole here?!?!?!", "created_utc": 1679550438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zah02/aita_for_feeling_excluded_from_my_childs_pregnancy/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unless she's giving you the adoption papers directly after giving birth (or even talked about it before hand) this is not your child, even if you marry the father. \n\nThat being said, if any of those arrangements weren't made, you have no right to include yourself into her Pregnancy.. Let alone say \"you're excluding me from my stepchilds pregnancy\" to the person who's pregnant with THEIR CHILD. \n\nNot your business.. Not your kid. Leave her alone.", "YTA.\n\nFirst for the title. Not your child. Not even your step child yet.\n\nSecond, fianc\u00e9 after six months? Speed running, but okay. That in and of itself isn't an issue, but trying to impose yourself so quickly on his baby mom is too much. Even if she had the kid a few years ago it would be a lot to ask for parental privledges after six months of dating.\n\nThird, you're putting aside completely reasonable opinions of people you shouldn't be dismissing out of hand. It is her choice, as your BF pointed out, and you should respect that even if you disagree. Even your sister was telling you to check your behavior, and honestly I'd say she's being pretty nice to you in this case.", "YTA  \n\n\nShe's right, her pregnancy is none of your business. She can include or exclude anyone she wants, no questions asked.  \n\n\nYou did something wrong. You tried to force yourself into a pregnancy that is none of your business, so I suggest that you offer a sincere apology.", "YTA big time. There are no future step mom's rights. Slow your roll before you push your fiance out the door. Listen to all the people in your life and the Internet strangers that are about to tell you that you are way out of line.", "You\u2019ve been dating the dad for 6 months.\n\nYou need to back off.

Or maybe she\u2019s trying to get back with your boyfriend. \n\nif it\u2019s the first two options then YTA because it\u2019s not your child it\u2019s hers, she\u2019s the mom, you\u2019ve only been dating the dad for a short while. She\u2019s carrying this child, as his actual mother, and she\u2019s going through all the trouble. You\u2019re just dating the father.", "YTA, it's not your child, you are girlfriend of father so stop inserting your butt where it doesn't belong. Pregnancy is hard enough, especially if she knows that she will be single mother and father's girlfriend is taking claim at her child. Even if you marry this man, you are not a parent. The entitlmemt of yours is through the roof.", "YTA. \n\nThis is not your child. Dad likely won't even have any overnight visits for at least the first few months. You won't have a hand in caring for the baby. And you aren't married. You've barely dated. It sounds like you are really pushing yourself into the situation and need to back off.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been dating this guy for six months, but you\u2019re calling his *unborn* kid \u201cyours\u201d and talking about how you\u2019re going to **marry** the father???\n\nThe child is not yours.  The pregnancy **absolutely** is not yours.  You need to back up, by several HUGE steps, and realize that what the mother wants for her pregnancy and medical care is all that matters.", "YTA. This isn\u2019t your child.- it already has two parents. This woman has every right to limit who is involved in her pregnancy. Just because you are marrying the baby\u2019s father does not make you a parent- it makes you a future step parent. The two biological parents get to decide how to raise this child, and you get to be only as involved as they let you. This isn\u2019t your child, so you need to wrap your head around the fact that it\u2019s not up to you- literally, none of it is up to you. Attempting to force your way into a parental role will not help you here. While many step parents do become parental figures for their step kids, it has to be done through mutual respect and love, because you\u2019re not entitled to any of it. All of the major decisions will the theirs- name, custody, schedule, how they raise the child, schools, extra curricular, etc- none of it will be up to you. Seriously, start thinking this through now, because your post makes me think you expect to weigh in on these decisions, and you definitely need to adjust that expectation. You and your fianc\u00e9 clearly need to have a long talk about what life will look like after the baby is born- where will it live, who will care for it if it stays with you, who can make decisions, etc.  you don\u2019t appear to  be on the same page at all.", "YTA\n\nReally???\n \"to see our future baby, and she agreed to let us both be in the delivery room when the baby comes\"???????\n\nIt's not \"our baby\" and agreeings means you possibly pestered her until she agreed.\n\nLeave her alone.\n\nShe is no part of your life and will not be.\nNo one!!! want to be part of ede\"s new family life", "YTA, the child & your partners ex is nothing to do with you, stop trying to push your way into being involved.\nYou\u2019ve only been dating 6 months so you don\u2019t know that you are going to marry him, you\u2019re still in the honeymoon period of dating!", "YTA.\n\nA pregnant lady has set boundaries respect that.\n\nYou're not the other mother.

This isn't your child, you didn't get her pregnant, and have no legal relationship to this child. You're dating the child's dad. Fiance has no legal relationship.  If you have been dating for 6 years you'd have more of a standing, but still until that marriage is done, you are the girlfriend. You can have a good step mom relationship if you remember that it is not your child. \n\nKeep it up and the mom will have rules about you being around the kid...as in she won't want you around.  And then your man will most likely have to make a choice, you or the kid. And if he is a good man, he'll choose the kid.", "Am i the only one here that literally shuddered reading this and wants to go tell the babys mom to be really, really freaking careful about letting op be around the baby?\n\nthis is giving serious the hand that rocks the cradle vibes.   the phrase ''our baby'' freaked me the hell out.\n\nThe baby isn't yours OP - you're literally just dating the babys dad and barely dating at that.  You've only been together for 6 months.\n\nThe baby is NOT yours as well and never will be.  at best it will be your stepchild one day,  but that's very far off in the future - years away.

YTA, to be honest you passed asshole territory and went straight to hand that rocks the cradle crazy territory.  You are together 6 months! I have food in my cupboards longer.  Look you are far too intense, you need to dial it right back or you are going to end up alone because your boyfriend is clearly sick of it too.", "YTA\n\nYou've only been around 6 months, you're not married to him yet, it's not your baby, and if she decides you don't belong in her kid's life then that's her choice.\n\nIf you can't handle the notion that you may never be involved with the child's life outside of visitation then you should break up.\n\nEdit: MASSIVE YTA how dare you try to push a narrative that SF is excluding you for no reason. \n\nShe's Bi and you think your Christian Values would be better for her child.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your child.  It's not your pregnancy and it sounds like you have gotten WAY too invested here in your role without considering her position or her privacy.  You are kind of behaving as if she is a surrogate or a mother that's agreed to adoption.  \n\nYou have been dating the man for 6 months (awfully fast for getting engaged), so obviously,  this whole chain of events from them \"talking\" to the present day has happened in a very short time.  That makes you basically a stranger.  Certainly not an intimate enough friend that it's reasonable to expect to be at birthing classes and in the delivery room. \n\nMaybe ALL of you should take a deep breath and slow down a little...except that *she can't slow down*, pregnancy doesn't work like that,  so you need to stop acting as though you're a main character and start playing a supporting role.  The child's father can keep you up to date on the news from doctor visits and so on, you don't need to be there. \n\nApologize for the excessive involvement    and remember that you're the father's girlfriend.  You might become this child's stepmom in due course but that doesn't mean you have a right to direct involvement with the pregnancy,  birth or  coparenting decisions.  You get to discuss your wishes, hopes & concerns with *your partner* but you can't demand that she include you as another parent.", "YTA. YOU ARE NOT THE MOTHER. Stop trying to be. It\u2019s creepy and overstepping. It\u2019s not YOUR child. It\u2019s your boyfriend\u2019s and another woman\u2019s. Please seek some professional help.", "YTA by far dude. Holy shit. And being homophobic in the comments? Yikes. Work on yourself.", "YTA the kid isn\u2019t even born yet. Why do you need to be instantly notified about any updates regarding the kid? Why do you need to be present at the breathing classes? How can you be sure that you will be in this kids life for more than a year?? You have been dating this guy for 6 months and are being really invasive about a kid that he fathered with another woman.\n\nEdit: Saw the wording of the title and had to edit to add this. The fact that you called an unborn baby in another woman your child says a lot about how unhealthy your view of this situation is!!", "YTA It's not your child and it most definitely isn't you're pregnancy. Frankly, your fianc\u00e9 is lucky she's letting him come. She doesn't have to it's her body.\n\nAlso, probably not the best idea to tell the pregnant that her child is your child. It isn't.

The ball will be entirely in her court.", "YTA. She\u2019s pregnant and going to be a single mother. You bringing up the fact that you\u2019ll be a bonus mother to the unborn child is a major overstep to someone who is facing a lot of unknowns and challenges. \n\nI truly believe that a baby can\u2019t get get too much love - but you have to understand your place in this delicate situation and back off. \n\nIf she wants to do this with the people she\u2019s closest too, including the father of the baby - Let her. \n\nApologize and tell her you\u2019ll be there if and when she needs you.

Your entire post, in terms of wording, reads almost like you expect you and your fianc\u00e9 to raise the baby.

This is her pregnancy and her baby. Focus on supporting her, your fianc\u00e9, etc. and stop trying to insert yourself beyond the boundary. If you really want the positive dynamic among everyone, this is the way. \n\nAlso, reading your comments\u2026it\u2019s really rich that you emphasize you and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s Christian lifestyle and how that makes him against being bi as if he\u2019s not the one who knocked a girl up he wasn\u2019t even dating out of wedlock. Like holy crap, both of you need to get off the high horse here. Remove the log from your own eye first, or whatever Jesus said. \n\nBasically the TL;DR here is that between the lines, it sounds like you think you will be a better mother than her and are overstepping bounds by a lot. She likely senses this. YTA. \n\nAlso, somewhat unrelated: you\u2019re engaged to a guy you\u2019ve been with for half a year. Who got someone else pregnant right before that.

I met him when he was *talking* to my sister\u2019s friend (21F).\n\nMy sister\u2019s friend found out she was pregnant with his child, and after trying to make a healthy relationship work they eventually called it quits. They both say that they work a lot better as friends than lovers, and I agree. She was completely fine with me dating him, and I was okay with her being pregnant by him. I\u2019m sure it was comforting to know *I* wasn\u2019t going to cause any cat fights over her pregnancy. My sister is also very excited because she was asked to be the godmother of the baby. Things seemed to be going well for all of us. I was happy in my relationship, and my sister\u2019s friend\u2019s pregnancy was going healthily. She allowed my fianc\u00e9 and I both to attend doctor appointments to see our future baby, and she agreed to let us both be in the delivery room when the baby comes. \n\nThen she started to exclude me. \n\nSF (Sister\u2019s friend) asked my fianc\u00e9 to come to a doctors appointment, but asked not to bring me. I was very hurt at first, but I understood. Then this started happening more and more often. I was excluded from the doctor\u2019s appointment where they found out the gender, and I\u2019ve been excluded from all of the birthing classes. Anytime I\u2019ve tried to bring this up to my fianc\u00e9 he tells me that it\u2019s up to her who she allowed at her medical appointments. He suggested that I talked to her.  The next time I saw her was tonight at my sister and SF\u2019s home for my sister\u2019s birthday dinner. I planned to talk to her after dinner alone, but after a couple glasses of wine things slipped out. I asked her if I did something to upset her. I explained her to that I\u2019m feeling left out of my step-child\u2019s pregnancy, and I was wondering if there was a reason. She got physically upset, and told me that her pregnancy is none of my business. My sister tried to calm the situation by changing the subject, but SF couldn\u2019t let it go. She went on and on how I shouldn\u2019t feel entitled to attend any of her appointments because it\u2019s not my baby. I brought up the fact that this will also be my child because I\u2019m marrying the father, and she should be happy that her child will have a bonus mom.She stormed out of the house, and left the three of us at a very awkward place. My sister blew up at me telling me that I need to apologize. I told her that I have nothing to apologize for because I haven\u2019t done anything wrong, and it just seems like SF wants to use this baby to get back with my fianc\u00e9. My sister asked us to leave, and the drive home was just as awkward as it was at the house. I asked my fianc\u00e9 if he thinks she still likes him, and all he could do is roll his eyes and tell me I\u2019m acting like an asshole.
