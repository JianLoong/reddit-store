Move inland to find someplace with cheaper rent.", "All he has to do is give you legal notice to vacate. It does not sound like you have a written lease, which makes you month to month tenants. If you have lived there for more than a year, it\u2019s a 60-day notice in San Diego. He can also choose to start charging or raise the rent as long as he gives legal notice as well.\n\nIf you choose to fight him, he can legally evict you, which would greatly impact your ability to rent in the future.\n\nYou can disagree with what your dad is doing, but you\u2019re dead wrong that he can\u2019t get you out one way or another.", "[deleted]", "Then get a second job.

His approach is really AHish. However if he thinks the house should be occupied by people with kids, that is his prerogative. Your an AH and really not smart of you think he can\u2019t kick you out and that you can live in his house while also being NC with him.

What you're thinking is adverse possession. In this case his father and he had an agreement that he pay the taxes and upkeep in lieu of rent. So one rule of adverse possession is eliminated. Another rule is that the owner of record (his father) has to agree. Which apparently he does not. \nThe father, as the owner on record can change the terms of their agreement if he wants, he can start eviction proceedings, or he increase the rent as long as he follows the laws on rent increases, allowing a specific amount of time before said increase starts.", "Pretty sure that only works if you\u2019re banging the owner of the house..", "Not even.

They have been there long enough NOT PAYING REAL RENT so they shoudl have been saving money all these years, at least enough for a decent down payment on a home of their own.", "Agreed.", "His dad more than likely made the arrangement because he thought his son would have kids one day and wanted to make sure he had a comfortable and nice sized place to raise his grandchildren. He wanted to essentially give them a good start.  It makes sense. Since sonny is not planning to have kids, then he needs to find his own place to live so that one of the other siblings can get the same good start for their family that OP got.  While it''s messed up to change the rules midgame (as someone else said) the father prbably had this in the bakc of his mind when he agreed to let OP stay there rent free. When the situation changed, the father changed his mind and that's okay.  I posted up above OP has been there long enough paying minimal rent and should have money saved up to go and place a down paymetn on a home of his own and let one of his siblings who decides to have kids get the benefit of a cheaper home solution which would help them out considerably. OP sounds very spoiled and going no contact is no big deal for dad but best believe he'llget him out the house one way or another becuase his paying the \"property taxes\" was essentially his rent.  This isn't an I paid the proeprty taxes all these years so it's my house issue. He' s going to cause a big rift in the family if he fights this and more than likely, he'll be the only one on the outside when all is said and done.  His decision to make but he and his wife are deliusional and shoul dhave been saving their money all this time as I'm sure they had to know they couldn't live in this house (that dad could be getting at least $5k for each month) for free forever.", "I can't speak to state taxes wherever OP lives but federally it doesn't mean shit for the tenant.  \n\nIt does impact how the landlord reports the income and whether or not you can treat the rental as a business.  \n\nSo to give a concrete example, since my rentals are done for profit, when I have to have do repairs, I can deduct those expenses.  Really expensive expenses can even be depreciated so that the tax benefit is spread out over several years.\n\nOPs dad, by contrast, could not deduct home repairs as any kind of business expense, because he's clearly not renting \"for profit\" here.\n\nAdditionally - and this is something of a guess, since OP living under dad's roof costs dad nothing it's not really a \"benefit\" to OP.  OP's basically an entitled charity case who's getting nothing worth reporting.", "That's not his problem", "Sounds like a you problem. Get roommates or move somewhere cheaper. Go no contact if you want, that won\u2019t stop a formal eviction process and won\u2019t stop the cops who will escort you off the property.", "That is not your dads problem. It's his house and he has every right to evict you. Paying property taxes does NOT make it your home. It's still your dads house.", "Unethical lifehack, tell your dad your giving in to his demands. After a year tell them you did anything you could but doctors said their is no way you\u2019ll be able to have a child.", "OP is way too entitled. They have been living in a house they could likely never afford and now he feels like he \u201cowns\u201d it when they don\u2019t make enough to even pay what the mortgage would be. OP is acting like his dad HAS to legally give it to him because he pays property taxes lol", "\ud83d\udcaf A 3bd house in SD will easily be 4k/month, and that's money he is losing every month. You're costing him nearly 50k a year. Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you!", "I live in San Diego as well and let me just say that they\u2019ll be lucky to find a 1 bedroom apartment for what their income is. Looks like OP is in a bit of a predicament.", "It does not.\n \nA tenant is paying the owner's property taxes, mortgage, along with some profit.\n \nThis does not grant a tenant ownership rights.\n \nDo people seriously not understand what rent is?", "Have you heard of the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d?\n\n*S/he who has the Gold makes the Rules*\n\nYour Dad\u2019s house.  His rules.  Don\u2019t like it?  GTFO.  \n\nI kind of agree with your Dad.  If you\u2019re not going to have a family you probably don\u2019t need such a big place.\n\nHe should just sell it.", "No, but he can tell you to get out of his house. Paying property taxes does not give you any legal rights to the house.", "You are absolutely correct.\n \nHe also is under no obligation to subsidize your life. His generosity has already cost him tens of thousands of dollars every year that you've lived there when he could have been renting at market rate.\n \nYou should have been using this time to gather a nest egg so that you could become a self sufficient adult. Instead, you're whining like a 15 year old that doesn't want to take out the garbage.", "You misspelled the username but it fits with OP throwing a tantrum like a child", "Your dad could rent the house for much higher and that would pay for the taxes. You sound like an entitled brat.", "Which was your \u201crent\u201d.  What part of that do you not understand?", "Aww... look hes learning. So sweet.", "Honestly, even if you\u2019ve checked all the boxes to qualify for adverse possession, you\u2019d still need to hire a shark of a lawyer to win, and there\u2019s still a pretty good chance that you\u2019d lose. Are you prepared for that expense? Have you even filed for quiet title yet?\n\nI think you\u2019ve been given some bad information. Most lawyers give a free first consult, so please go check with one and get some good advice.", "And\u2026 you don\u2019t have the title deed in your name\u2026 its not your house\u2026 how you reached 30 and don\u2019t understand the fundamentals of property ownership I don\u2019t know ha", "You are a BIG boy now.", "Oh come on. I went with E S H for everyone except the wife, who is being told by her FIL \"Your uterus is now to be used to pay your husband's rent\" and by her husband \"No problem, ignore the old man, we don't need to start looking for a new place to live\".  \n\n\nWannabegranddaddy's demands are outrageous and assholic. His son evidently didn't fall far from the tree.", "So we\u2019re just going to sit back while men control the uterus of women yet again?  Not even including the fact he made this demand according to OP with little notice and no time to give op to think, talk to wife to confirm, go back to dad and tell him what they both want and then dad gives notice to vacate?  Is it really reasonable that they have to move asap because they don\u2019t want kids today but may want them in the next 5 years?\n\nI think ESH cause they are all acting with emotion, making unilateral decisions that effect everyone and could cause permanent damage to multiple relationships?  What if they have the kid dad is demanding in the next 10 years, living elsewhere and dad has set them up to fail down the road for a decision neither of them should be making and then there\u2019s the threat of dad never seeing OP\u2019s kid if he does have one so they\u2019ll both have gotten what they wanted while wife is the one who should be making this decision?", "Yeah even though his later comment about him raising the grandchild go into unreasonable territory, I don't think it is ridiculous to expect them to have children in the 3BR house he is footing the bill for. They can move but the dad is allowed to have a vision for his family since it's his money.", "I'm already getting downvoted, so maybe I'm missing something? Do people honestly think providing grandchildren in exchange for housing is normal? \ud83e\udd14", "I mean, that's kind of a bold assumption of OP's dad. Did he state this rule to his son when he moved into the house? Does OP actually have siblings that need the place? It sounds more like a temper tantrum to me because the man wanted grandchildren. It's not about OP having saved up money by now or not, it's about his dad being controlling. He's the type of parent who is only willing to help when his kids do exactly as he says. That's not how it works. His kind gestures shouldn't have strings attached.\n\nIf he wants to do something else with the place, that's fair. It's his place at the end of the day. But it honestly sounds like he is just trying to control his son, especially because he said 'I'll raise it'.", "Yeah it sucks he\u2019s kicking you out over not having kids, but it is his property. So he can do whatever he wants with the property, including kicking you out for whatever reason he wants to.", "OP is entitled because he is grown up and nobody owns him anything but where did the unconditional parental love go? Of course, again, his father doesn't own him anything but isn't the point of unconditional love to love someone no matter what? Or maybe parents' love isn't unconditional after all? Is everyone lying?\nI really have hard time understanding this.", "Next door house is going at usd 7k/month. So it is 84k/year subsidy", "No, paying rent does not give you any equity in the property.", "This isnt rent. This is allowing a kid to stay there for far less than the value of the house/rent.", "Exactly, it is not okay to change the rules during the game.", "If you ignore it, it will go away. Sure, Jane /s.", "I mean he has 6 other sons and one still young enough that he can change his ways to ensure that one doesn\u2019t turn out to be an entitled brat.", "Not if he kicks you out.", "No its not, its where you live but its not your home, thats your dads.", "time to put the big boy pants on and grow up and be financial responsible... \n\nfor the first time in your life it seems like - you've had an insanely good deal, you have completely wasted..", "Whatever emotional attachment you have to the property, it is still not yours. I am coming to the conclusion you and your wifes sense of entitlement might have been a motivational factor for him wanting you to leave rather than you not wanting to have kids.", "dude you even admitted its not your house. Cut it with the entitlement and get off daddy's property.", "He absolutely can kick you out. It would be understandable for many reasons he needs the money or you are a bad tenant. Kicking you out over not having kids is completely crappy. Has he always been a controlling parent? It\u2019s time to move and examine your relationship with your father. If he were trying to control me he would be a very very small part of my life.", "Unconditional love doesn't include subsidising your adult child to the tune of $7000/month indefinitely with no conditions (or at all). That's not unconditional love, that's unconditional bankrolling.", "OP is a grown ass 30 year old with a wife. His dad can love him without letting his adult child bum off of him.", "His father doesn't say he doesn't love him, just that he's not going to continue to provide him with free housing at 30, because he had hoped he and his wife would live differently. Being disappointed in your children's choices and giving them perks based on your own values, doesn't mean you don't love them.\nWe have OPs perspective here, it reads to me like the father thinks he's given OP such an easy ride in life that he and his wife have never really grown up.", "Owe", "If there's no lease or rental agreement then it's not rent.\n\nHe should get a lawyer. If he's been living there for years and receiving mail, he may have some rights.", "It\u2019s literally not just \u201chim paying rent\u201d lmao I hope he seeks actual legal advice instead of thinking people like you know what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t OWN the house but his dad can\u2019t just say \u201cok get out\u201d either. Tenant rights are a thing.", "It's still rent.\n \nI have an apartment that I have rented to family that has hit a rough patch for less than market rate, it's still rent. I also had the wherewithal to draw up a lease to make it legal and protect myself just in case they decided to be shitty.", "Dude if you think paying property taxes entitles you to live there indefinitely, then you\u2019ve been spoiled your whole life. Once you make enough to pay the mortgage, property taxes, utilities and maintenance, get back to us. \n\nUntil then, you barely own the picture of the house in your mind lol", "Believe it or not, virtually all renters pay all property taxes. \n\nOn commercial rent, it's paid separately.\n\nIn residential, it's generally rolled into the rent.\n\nIt gives you 0 title. You have no claim on the home, either ethically, financially, or legally.\n\nRent is usually taxes+mortgage+repair allotment + profit. You're only paying a fraction of that.", "Which is considered rent and nothing else he can evict you for what ever he want.", "Technically you don\u2019t.", "Lmfaoooo you don\u2019t own the place.

No you don\u2019t\u2026", "If you genuinely think that talk to a property lawyer", "How do you figure that?!", "I\u2019m wondering if the dad has another child with children who he would like to help.  Childcare is a massive expense in a lot of areas and probably assumes that he has helped his son enough", "I\u2019m wondering if he (dad) has another child who has children who he would like to be able to help out too", "I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a sibling or cousin who has young children who the father feels would benefit more from the awesome deal on the home? The mention of it being a family home makes me suspect that may be the case - that he\u2019d rather help a fledgling family than subside a double income no kids couple who should have been able to save for a mortgage during the time they\u2019ve lived rent free.", "Well, the father can obviously afford it. He is willing to go on with this if OP has a kid. So, this isn't a money problem. I would totally get it if the father said 'hey, you are 30 years old, it's time to get your shit together'. But this isn't about that. This is classic example of 'I'm willing to do anything for you as long as you let me control your personal choices'.", "Exactly. But his father didn't say that. This is not about money or responsibility. I agree that OP needs to get his shit together but he father was OK with him doing this up until this point. Why change his opinion now?", "I didn't say that ne doesn't love him. He just doesn't love him unconditionally. 'I will kick you out if you don't have kids' it's a condition. I'm just tired of that bullshit with unconditional love. That's it.", "You need a lot more than just paying the property taxes with the agreement of the homeowner.", "Verbal contracts are still contracts, they're just harder to enforce.", "Good thing OP doesn\u2019t want kids!", "This is unfair.

He's entitled. Thinks he owns his dad's property when he doesn't. Thinks he can go no contact and still live there. Entitlement is one thing when you're like 22 and dumb because you haven't experienced life yet, but OP is 30. It's time for him to get his shit together. There's nothing wrong with accepting help from your parents but at least be respectful about it. OP is crossing a line. \n\n\nI will say demanding a grandchild is never OK but I can understand why OP's dad was good with letting them live there with a kid but would want them out if it's just two grown adults. His dad would be better off renting to a young family that needs the space or even selling it than just letting them live there forever that far below market value.", "His love isn't conditional on him having kids, but his financial support is. Hope that's clearer. The love is still unconditional, the money is not.", "Not in all states. I've seen it happen.", "Ok, I get your point. But if this is more like bussiness deal why didn't the father list his conditions before hand?", "What state so we can verify your claim. Most likely you misunderstood the situation.", "You can buy a house that was seized due to non-payment of back taxes, and then pay those taxes to acquire a property, but ownership is not not going to transfer because you paid rent that covered the property taxes.", "It's not a business deal, he was doing his som a favour and helping him save money. OP has been living there for a while. He said he was there before he got married a year ago. Could be that he was young and his dad wanted him to save on rent when he moved in, wanted him to get financially stable first and just thought he'd want to move out when he could afford to, or stay if he wanted a family given it's a bigger home. Could be that he let his son stay there to enable OP and wife to save up for the wedding. Could be many reasons, but he isn't obliged to continue to support his son financially."]}
