Move inland to find someplace with cheaper rent.", "All he has to do is give you legal notice to vacate. It does not sound like you have a written lease, which makes you month to month tenants. If you have lived there for more than a year, it\u2019s a 60-day notice in San Diego. He can also choose to start charging or raise the rent as long as he gives legal notice as well.\n\nIf you choose to fight him, he can legally evict you, which would greatly impact your ability to rent in the future.\n\nYou can disagree with what your dad is doing, but you\u2019re dead wrong that he can\u2019t get you out one way or another.", "[deleted]", "Then get a second job.

His approach is really AHish. However if he thinks the house should be occupied by people with kids, that is his prerogative. Your an AH and really not smart of you think he can\u2019t kick you out and that you can live in his house while also being NC with him.

What you're thinking is adverse possession. In this case his father and he had an agreement that he pay the taxes and upkeep in lieu of rent. So one rule of adverse possession is eliminated. Another rule is that the owner of record (his father) has to agree. Which apparently he does not. \nThe father, as the owner on record can change the terms of their agreement if he wants, he can start eviction proceedings, or he increase the rent as long as he follows the laws on rent increases, allowing a specific amount of time before said increase starts.", "Pretty sure that only works if you\u2019re banging the owner of the house..", "Not even.

There is no loss here on OP's father's behalf, he's just wasn't extorting someone for their money before now.\n\nThat is crazy that's it's reasonable for OP's father to want a hypothetical grandchild to \"have a better life than you can afford\", but he also doesn't want his own living child to have a better life than he can afford?? How is that understandable?\n\nOP is a moron for thinking his father has no right to kick him out, but he is not the AH here.", "Your analysis is correct, but I would like more info on the deal that OP and their father made. It's unclear if it's business, or a gift, or a gift with conditions. Did the deal ever have an end time? It would certainly be E S H if OP's father just started imposing conditions at this time. Of course, maybe OP and OP's father realized that OP really needs to fly from the nest, and that it wouldn't be a forever arrangement.", "Oh, I believe it. Some people go absolutely insane about getting grandchildren.", "If you go no contact you definitely can't live in his house. Look, move out. It's not worth it. Or wait for him to throw you out and have that on your file when trying to rent another house.", "You\u2019re right, he can\u2019t, but he also doesn\u2019t have to let you live in HIS house.", "What if your wife couldn\u2019t have kids? Like a medical reason or already had a hysterectomy? What would your dad be doing then? Could you just tell your dad that she has a medical issue and it prevents her from getting pregnant?", "True. But he CAN get you to gtfo of HIS house.", "In most States (including California where OP is located) no lease means you are considered \u201cmonth-to-month\u201d which affords you less right and means only a 30 or 60 day notice is required (since OP has lived there more than a year, then it\u2019s a 60-day notice).", "He says the property taxes are way lower than the market rate rent for the area. His monthly house expenses ~1.5k and neighbours rent ~7k . That\u2019s 5.5k a month generously assuming 1.5k is ALL tax and doesn\u2019t include food, utilities etc. \n\nSo while the things you list (lawnmower, time with family etc) could be considered a lost opportunity by the uncharitable, it\u2019s the scale of loss here that really tips it for me. I would say it\u2019s fair to call 66k a year a huge financial loss\u2026 but kudos to you could comfortably sacrifice that kind of money each year and not feel it", "He is living there for a seventh of what the market rate rental price would be. It's essentially rent-free.", "I\u2019ll tell the landlord that one because I\u2019m paying his mortgage through my rent it\u2019s actually my house /s", "He's subsidizing you bro, not the other way around.\n\nGo make your own life and you won't have to deal with his demands for grandbabies.", "Doesn\u2019t matter, the State considers that rent.", "Yes HIS. On HIS property. That HE owns. Not you", "Open says he lived there before meeting his wife so I highly doubt there were expectations then of it being a family home.", "Yeah, probably did think it would be cool because that was the arrangement they had. Why would he presume that his housing was contingent on having a baby? That's insane. If his \"generosity has now run out\" because his son isn't having a baby, he's an ass. Your good will towards your children shouldn't hinge on whether they give you grandchildren. Either be willing to let him use the house or don't. It's not costing the dad anything.", "Because many people care about their kids. It\u2019s an American thing to kick people out ASAP and not want to help loved ones because technically, they don\u2019t have to.", "Well.. if the market price/rent would be 7k/month and OP pays only 1,5k a month, the difference is 5500x12= 66 000 a year. It is a considerable amount.", "IMO that\u2019s a wild if not insane suggestion on the dad\u2019s part and hints at some weirdness going on with him. Have a baby and then just sign it over to him? The hell? I\u2019m child free too, but you bet that if I had a child, I would want to be the one raising it. \n\nThat\u2019s possibly somewhat colored by the fact that I\u2019d be the one carrying the pregnancy, of course, so I\u2019m gonna bet OP\u2019s wife would see this the way I do. Have essentially a surrogate pregnancy? Does he understand how debilitating a pregnancy is for a woman\u2019s body, and that this is likely plays a role in OP\u2019s wife not wanting kids of her own? Pregnancy has recently come to receive legal protections (the workplace accommodations process) that traditionally apply to disabled people, and this is for very good reasons. It\u2019s not just sport a cute little belly for a few months, then pop it out quick like you\u2019re taking a bun from an oven, and then everything bounces back to normal by the  next day. Has he even asked her about her feelings on carrying a pregnancy, let alone as a surrogate?\n\nIf he hasn\u2019t had serious discussions with her which show that she\u2019d be willing to consider this, then his proposal is insulting and shows no consideration for *her* wants and needs as a separate person. Usually, surrogates are meant to choose the work of their own accord, because many women would never do it regardless of money and money should not be the sole motivator if someone is doing a profoundly intimate and painful task for you. (I do get that some surrogate mothers *do* do it because they desperately need money, which is fucked up, but no need to add more.)\n\nLikely, OP would feel similarly about wanting to raise any child he does father. He doesn\u2019t bear the burden of pregnancy, but most dads end up caring what happens to their children and want to be involved. \n\n\u2026 Anyway, though, OP has the right to be pissed at his dad, and dad has no right to bully his son into having grandkids. But it\u2019s also true that OP has zero legal right to stay there once he\u2019s given notice to leave and the term expires. He could go to the local legal aid clinic to see if there are any nuances of the situation (maybe provisions in whatever agreement they signed if any) that help his case. He could also look up California laws (and maybe local ordinances) that apply to rentals, and he probably should regardless so that he understands the termination/eviction process.\n\n**Edit: *I* ended up looking into California law and found a 2019 bill called AB 1482, which created a few new very important tenancy protections (at CA code sections 1946.2 and 1947.12). I wrote another comment discussing it at length just now, but essentially the eviction process may be a lot more difficult for OP\u2019s dad than any of us thought.**\n\nBut I\u2019d bet that they are going to have to find somewhere else to live in in San Diego, or move away. It does suck of course, since their finances aren\u2019t in great shape, but is what it is. Maybe a two bedroom shared with a roommate? I\u2019d check out rooms for rent that are couple friendly, or get a few people together and rent a house.\n\nLast solution, tell dad that they changed their minds, are trying to conceive and just need some more time to get there. This buys more time to find a good deal on an apartment. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n**Edit: [link to my other comment with my legal research.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159q2x8/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_he_cant_kick_me_out/jtk89qj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3) I know it\u2019s boring, but it\u2019s very important stuff to mention here, given that everyone is assuming dad can evict OP for any reason (and enough notice) and OP AND his dad may believe the same.

There's no indication the father is going to cut off OP, or making demands that they MUST have a grandchild.

It\u2019s clear that some tough love is probably well overdue to push OP toward growing up and building a real life. \n\nI agree with you that trying to coerce OP into having kids is not a great move, especially if OP has no interest in having kids. As a new father myself, it is definitely not something to enter into lightly. If OP doesn\u2019t want kids, it\u2019s best for everyone if they don\u2019t have them, especially the hypothetical kid. However, I just can\u2019t get past how entitled OP is to think their father owes them the house just because he was nice enough to let them live there for so long. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the dad can make whatever stipulations he wants at this point because OP is plenty old enough to work something else out for themselves if they\u2019re not happy with the arrangement. There are parents who kick their kids out at 18 \u2014 I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s right, but at some point kids do need to figure out how to take responsibility and provide for themselves.

He can absolutely kick you out.", "It is in his name, he can kick you out, and he doesn't need to let you live in his three bedroom house in San Diego. You can rent a one bedroom just like everybody else. YTA", "\"Just because it's in his name doesn't mean he can kick us out \"\n\nLMAO YES HE CAN!!!", "YTA well I agree your dad\u2019s behavior is terrible, ultimately it\u2019s his house, you have no legal claim to it, he is the owner and can charge you rent or kick you out if he chooses. Hopefully you\u2019ve both been saving while living there.", "You can go no contact in another property. \n\nYour dad\u2019s house is his therefore if he says you gotta go then you gotta go, no matter how absurd the reason is. \n\nNTA for not wanting kids but AH for the entitlement on the house.", "It's a shifty reason to kick you out but doesn't matter. He owns it so all he has to do is file eviction notice with the court and give you 30day notice.  \n\nThis is not a hill you want to die on because you will lose", "This is the reply I was looking for. Wish it had the upvotes it deserves.", "Born and raised in San Diego. A one bedroom apartment is $2,000. If you want to go fancier than the average is $2,600. It\u2019s just him and his wife. They can manage just fine. They don\u2019t need three bedrooms. For what? They aren\u2019t having any kids \n\nHis dad can demand grandkids because the only reason he allowed his son in that house was for the purpose of OP providing for his family. But OP doesn\u2019t want to raise a family. Therefore, he\u2019s gotta go.", "Yeah, $4000 combined in San Diego is nothing. Those Two will be looking for a studio to rent in Ocean Beach soon. You and your father both are TA", "I wouldn't help a child of mine who decides to stay childfree in the same way or amount I would help a child with a family and I don't think that's unfair. \n\nJust like I don't think it's unfair to help a child while they get their footing in the adult world (letting him live there before he met his wife) but thinking this help will come to an end at some point... \n\nThe issue here is lack of communication on everyone's part... Dad assumed OP and his wife would be having kids and was therefore ready to help indefinitely in this context. OP and wife assumed the help was indefinite without conditions. \n\nI think it's ESH... people really need to learn to talk....", "I never said they needed 3 bedrooms. I said they needed to get better jobs and move out. \n\nNobody gets to demand anyone has a child. Full stop, end of. If OPs dad wants to repossess because he only let them stay there \"in case\" they had a family, he's perfectly entitled. Doesn't even need that much reason. But he doesn't own his DILs uterus as compensation. No one does.", "He\u2019s not demanding him. He\u2019s giving him an ultimatum. That house is to help OP raise a family. No family, no house. End of.", "Worse, it's a demand with menaces. Do what i want, or be homeless. \n\nPersonally, I'm not that invested in this. OP is a prick and seems to take after his father. Neither are in the right. YOMV but I'm too tired to care. Sleep well when night comes, over there. From the UK.", "How is he going to be homeless if he and wife make 4K a month and have lived practically rent free? Especially him. Since he\u2019s been living there from before he even got married. Where\u2019s all that money going? I doubt he doesn\u2019t have any money. Unless he\u2019s been spending it without thought. \n\nEven if he did, that\u2019s a HIM problem. He should have enough money to leave.", "Why is he forcing them to have kids, tho? Even claiming he'd raise them himself? Like... why?\n\nOP may be an AH regarding the property, but he owes no one any kids. In his place, I'd also lose it and be like \"I'm about to go NC with you\"", "He's not forcing them to have kids. If they have kids, he'll help by giving them a house to live in with the kids. If they don't have kids they don't get that help.\n\nOP is lucky to have had such a generous leg up in life. He and his partner are now where they want to be. He doesn't need that help anymore.", "Then say you want market rates instead of bringing up kids. Dad is passive aggressive or a controlling nut bag. As I said, no one is coming off well in this scenario.", ">  He can kick him out for any reason he wants and that doesn't make him an AH.\n\nlol No. If OP's dad were kicking him out because he had children everyone would be calling the dad an asshole for \"endangering kids.\" \n\nThe kids are the deciding factor here. OP doesn't have kids so his loss of housing is an acceptable risk. Kids are \"vulnerable\" and society thinks everyone is obligated to care for someone under 18 no matter who the parents are so in the alternate universe OP's dad would be on the hook.", "Why is he saying that he'd raise the kid, then? That's the bit I don't get!\n\nOP **defo** is in a privileged position, and he shouldn't antagonize his father like that because.... he doesn't own the house xD! But he pays the property tax, thoooo xDD!"]}
