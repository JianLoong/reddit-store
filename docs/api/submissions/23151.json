Your payment of property taxes is irrelevant- that doesn\u2019t give you any ownership to control, it\u2019s essentially just rent. He can evict you whenever he wants. \n\nIf you\u2019re not okay with his stupid rules, then move out. San Diego is incredibly expensive. Move inland to find someplace with cheaper rent.", "All he has to do is give you legal notice to vacate. It does not sound like you have a written lease, which makes you month to month tenants. If you have lived there for more than a year, it\u2019s a 60-day notice in San Diego. He can also choose to start charging or raise the rent as long as he gives legal notice as well.\n\nIf you choose to fight him, he can legally evict you, which would greatly impact your ability to rent in the future.\n\nYou can disagree with what your dad is doing, but you\u2019re dead wrong that he can\u2019t get you out one way or another.", "[deleted]", "Then get a second job. Move out of San Diego.", "Welcome to the world of 2023. That\u2019s actually not your dad\u2019s problem.", "This doesn't change anything. He's still ta. He can still kick you out.", "That\u2019s your problem. He can kick you out anyway. \n\nThis is a clear ESH. Your father should keep his opinion out of your reproductive choices. His approach is really AHish. However if he thinks the house should be occupied by people with kids, that is his prerogative. Your an AH and really not smart of you think he can\u2019t kick you out and that you can live in his house while also being NC with him. That\u2019s just idiotic.", "Then you're probably looking at an eviction.", "Then tell him you changed your mind, and you\u2019ll keep trying, but both you and wife get fixed.", "Do you pay attention to the news? People get evicted all the time for not being able to afford their rent; that\u2019s not the landlord\u2019s problem. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine you really don\u2019t know this.", "Think you might have to move to a less expensive place", "So he\u2019s funding your lifestyle, and you feel entitled.", "Yep, \u201cHIS\u201d is the key word here. You got it!", ">I paid HIS property taxes\n\nSo. Effing. What. \n\nI just did some quick math. My taxes, divided by 12 (months) would be no more than one-sixth what market rents are in my area. Your dad is letting you stay at his house for way way WAY less than market.\n\nIt is HIS house. HIS name is on the deed. You have ZERO right to stay there. If you cannot afford market rent, move to a cheaper COL area or improve your skills and get a better job. \n\nDaddy owes you nothing.\n\nEdited to add: YTA", "Big deal.", "Most tenants pay their landlord\u2019s property taxes. They just don\u2019t pay it directly.  When you rent a property, part of your rent usually goes towards the property taxes.", "Everyone understands that. Makes no difference it\u2019s his house. You have no rights.", "Yup...that's called rent.", "He could easily pay the property taxes with the 6-7k amount in rent that he'll get after he kicks you out, though", "The only way to do that is by moving out. Time to do that. You don't need all your stuff. Go minimalist and/or find a storage facility. Your father thinks you are too dependent on him and his house - and perhaps he's right - and he believes you'll give in.", "Then she sounds as deluded as you do. How can you go no contact when you are both living in his house?\n\nHow on earth do you get to the age of 30 and not understand how home ownership works?\n\nHe has no right to tell you to have children but you have no automatic right to live in his house either", "That has zero to do with any of this.", "How do you plan on going no contact with your landlord?", "What makes it horrible?", "Not really. What you're thinking is adverse possession. In this case his father and he had an agreement that he pay the taxes and upkeep in lieu of rent. So one rule of adverse possession is eliminated. Another rule is that the owner of record (his father) has to agree. Which apparently he does not. \nThe father, as the owner on record can change the terms of their agreement if he wants, he can start eviction proceedings, or he increase the rent as long as he follows the laws on rent increases, allowing a specific amount of time before said increase starts.", "Pretty sure that only works if you\u2019re banging the owner of the house..", "Not even. He has absolutely no rights to the property. What he did is construed as rent.", "Nah. That sounds like a tenant, NOT an owner.", "Idk why you're being downvoted lol you're correct. It obviously depends on if he's paying straight to the tax people vs his dad tho", "That's why I don't want kids", "And go where exactly? I paid his property taxes", "We can go no contact", "I paid all of his property taxes", "And go where? This is our home.", "So technically I own the place", "Op's wife will eventually become too old.", "Nope, it only works if he's paying straight to the taxes or if he's paying his dad", "You could be wrong, depending on how he's making payments. If he's just paying straight to the taxes he could make a claim on the house. If money is going to his dad tho that would be different", "No one here cares that you don\u2019t want kids\u2014 you and your wife are entitled to be child-free. The question was whether or not you were an asshole for telling your dad he couldn\u2019t kick you out, and you are because you\u2019re wrong. Familiarize yourself with tenancy laws before running your mouth.", "Nobody here said shit about you not wanting kids man.", "You know he can kick you out. I don\u2019t know where you got the idea that he can\u2019t. He owns the house you do not.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. He CAN kick you out of the house. He has all the legal rights, you do not. \n\nYTA for being entitled and running your mouth. \n\nN  T  A for not wanting kids.", "No one cares here.", "But that doesn't matter. It's not your house. He can absolutely kick you out.", "That means literally nothing. Letting you live there while only paying property tax was very generous of your father. It in no way means you own the home or have any rights to it. It is your dad\u2019s house. \n\nYou can choose not to have kids. Just move somewhere else.", "Dude, you keep spouting shit that has absolutely 0 to do with whether or not your dad can evict you. \n\nHE CAN!!!!\n\nDoesn't matter if you cannot afford elsewhere, not his problem. Doesn't matter that you paid the property taxes, the house isn't in your name.\n\nYTA for not listening to hundreds of people telling you the exact same thing and using the same false arguments.\n\nIf you want to keep living there, have a kid. If not move out, go NC, and quit crying but I paid the property taxes.", "The more I read your replies to all the rational comments the more it seems like you're some kind of bot or just plainly an imbecile. You give the same short replies to everyone, you don't even think about what people are commenting about your shit show and illogical decisions: \"I won't leave my fathers house at 30 years old even if he doesn't want me there and on top of that I'll go no contact!\". Where's the logic in that? Grow up dude.", "you keep saying this, and it means nothing.  welcome to the real world where people have to pay actual rent and not a percentage of what it would cost to live in a house in san diego.", "When someone pays rent and their lease comes up and the owner tells them to go, it's irrelevant how much rent they've paid, they have to leave and then you pay rent somewhere new.\n\nPaying property taxes doesn't give you any rights to stay there, it's literally nothing. Only the ownership of the house matters, it's not yours. Go anywhere, you have to find somewhere with rent you can afford which sounds like somewhere else or something very very small in the same area.", "Take him to court for reimbursement.", "To some place you're legally allowed to live. Very soon, your current place will no longer match that description. You can either accept that reality or let it blindside you.", "Sure. Of course you can. Not sure if you think that prevents your dad from evicting you? \u2018Cause it doesn\u2019t.", "While living in Daddy\u2019s house? Hahahaha", "You're entitled to not want kids and go no contact. But he's also entitled to kick you out of his property and let you figure out rent you can't afford while not talking to him.", "That won\u2019t prevent him from evicting you.", "He's got more kids.", "And that will do nothing to prevent the legal proceedings.", "even if you cut him off as your dad he's still your landlord", "I don't think he'll care.", "If you\u2019re kicked out than absolutely go no contact with your dad. Help this planet, remain childless.", "And then what? He\u2019s gonna miss out on his non-existent grandkids? \n\nHe\u2019s already kicking you and your wife out of the house. I don\u2019t think your no contact will be a shock.", "I don\u2019t think he cares about that.", "Well yeah, and then you\u2019ll be escorted out by the police when he evicts you. Sorry, OP, not talking to your dad can\u2019t prevent you from being evicted. You don\u2019t have the leverage you seem to think.", "Do you really think that\u2019s gonna stop you from being evicted", "With the sheriff? Good luck with that", "Emotional blackmail doesn't matter in the eyes of the law he can still evict you. Your little threat doesn't mean anything to him because all he wants is grandkids", "So what?? Will he forget about the house because you\u2019re not talking to him?", "Are you stupid? Paying the taxes doesn\u2019t give you rights to the property. You are coming across like a petulant entitled baby-man. I get that you are over kids. But if you want to be free from your dad\u2019s badgering to have kids, get out on your own. Other people do it, so can you. You should have saved up some money by now. Rent an apartment.", "So? That\u2019s likely less than you\u2019d have paid for a year of rent in the same market. None of this prevents your dad from giving you legal notice to vacate or filing for an eviction if you guys don\u2019t comply. If he\u2019s serious about it, you don\u2019t want to let it get to that point. An eviction on your record will decimate your credit and make it very hard to rent somewhere else.", "Doesn\u2019t matter he owns the house. Start packing.", "Sorry but that doesn\u2019t mean anything.. it does not give you rights to stay in the home of dad wants to evict you.", "So what? If you lived anywhere else you'd be paying rent, and wayyy more since you said you can't afford to move out. Paying the taxes in exchange for living there doesn't mean you have legal rights. If he evicts you, you will NEVER find an apartment with an eviction on your record.", "Right, like rent. How much did it come to per month?", "No. It\u2019s your fathers home. He\u2019s just renting it to you. \n\nHe\u2019s got some dumbass reasons for wanting you out. But you aren\u2019t entitled to stay there just because you want to.", "It won\u2019t be your home once your dad evicts you and then trying to find something to rent with an eviction on your background check won\u2019t make anything easier for you.", "No, it is your dad\u2019s home. He let you stay there rent free. Doesn\u2019t matter to pay the property taxes. It is not yours and you do not have a right to be there if he doesn\u2019t want you there.", "You are missing the point- it\u2019s your dads home. Not yours.", "Bruh. Apartments.com. Zillow. Apartment finder. There is your where\u2026", "Go live somewhere you can afford without your father\u2019s help. It may not be as nice as the house you\u2019re in now but it will be yours.", "It may be your home because that\u2019s where you built your life but it ain\u2019t your house. Going NC will most likely compel him to evict you out faster so I don\u2019t even understand why you think that\u2019s a solution \ud83d\ude02", "No.   This seems to be your father's property that you are living in.  (Also, there are thousands of other places you could move to.)", "Move to La Jolla; it\u2019s pretty affordable.", "Somewhere you can afford.", "You don\u2019t want kids\u2026.go find a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment in Oceanside, San Marcos or Escondido. You will be fine.", "That is really not how home ownership works.", "You absolutely do not own the place bc you pay the property taxes as \u201crent\u201d\n\nYour dad can legally evict you if he so chooses..", "Lol.

What about this don't you understand? Being an obtuse, entitled, delusional tool will not help your situation at all, just sayin.", "How can you even think that? The name on the deed owns the place. You were paying basically rent. You don\u2019t own anything", "I\u2019m paying my landlords property taxes because I\u2019m paying him rent.  Doesn\u2019t mean I own the house!", "No. If you paid a mortgage, then you own the place.\n \nIs this just bait? Surely, you don't really think like this.", "Hahahahaaha NOPE that\u2019s not what paying taxes mean", "Omg you keep saying that. You do not own the place because you paid the taxes. Are you that dumb? You sound stupid AF now by repeating the same thing. You don\u2019t live in the real world and one day, it\u2019s going to smack you in the face.", "Oh... sweetie. No.", "ONLY if you let him lapse on them and went through the city/county/state/whatever official process of buying out the back due taxes and bought the house that way. Otherwise no, you just paid HIS property tax for HIS property. \ud83e\udd37", "No, you do not. His name is on the house. You don't own the place just because you pay property taxes. He has every right to evict you and if he took it to court, he'd win. I'd start saving up because it sounds like you might not have a house soon.", "Bahahahaha you may want to talk to a lawyer.", "No, technically you're probably a renter.", "How do you think owning a house works? \n\nJeez.", "Lol not even a little bit, that\u2019s not how that works. His name on the deed? His house, regardless of who\u2019s been paying what bills. You MIGHT have some sort of claim if you\u2019ve been paying the property taxes directly to the county or whatever, but obviously, you need to sort that out in court, and I highly doubt that\u2019s actually going to get you ownership of the house. If you refuse to leave or stop responding to him or whatever, he can absolutely get the courts to remove you through an eviction process. And if you\u2019ve been formally evicted, it\u2019s gonna be really hard to find another place to stay.", "Is your name on the deeds? If not then no you don't own the place. Your dad does and yes he can evict you", "Hahahaha. No you don\u2019t! The property taxes are equivalent of a fraction of the rent. You\u2019re not on the title or mortgage or insurance. You don\u2019t own squat.", "When you pay rent the landlord is charging you so they can pay off property taxes, wear and tear, maintenance, profit and tax on their earnings.\n\nYou're paying off the property tax directly, that gives you zero ownership rights in the slightest.
