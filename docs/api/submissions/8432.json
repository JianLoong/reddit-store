{"id": 8432, "submission_id": "10mm4xz", "title": "AITA for yelling at him to get his dog off the bed?", "selftext": "We have been together 5 years. Two years ago he begged for a dog. I've never been a fan of dogs but it was never at the fault of the dog either. It was because of my family. My mom was your \"let's have 8 dogs that keep popping out puppies and never clean up after them\" type of person. Therefore I grew up resenting dogs, their smells and their presence. I was bullied a lot because of how I smelt due to how many dogs we had. BUT now that I'm older and away from my mom and her dogs, I actually do like dogs. Some more than others of course (like my SILs dog is a fucking gem and I love her to bits and I would trade her with my husband's dog in a heart beat if my husband or SIL allowed it). That sounds mean but I'm just being honest. So anyways, my husband gets his dog. I tried endlessly to train her. Professional trainers included. She actually was given a certificate of achievement and taken out of training back 6 or 7 months ago. At that point I was like 8 months pregnant. \n\nNow one thing that I am completely against is the dog being on the bed. She can be on all the rest of the furniture (sofas, recliners, etc). Just not on the bed. She knows this. She NEVER tried to get on the bed until we had the baby. At that point she would whine while standing with her paws on the side of the bed and I thought she was being curious about the baby but that's 100% not the case at all. It was jealousy. Resource guarding. We got her checked back in to training following her jumping up on the bed continuously following that and forcing her way in-between my husband and the baby, where she proceeded to push the baby quite hard with her back paws and snuggle in to my husband while whining and eyeing my kid. It's ONLY when it comes to my husband. She does the same thing whenever he is holding the baby. She loses her fucking mind whining and trying to jump on him. It's dangerous so we got her back in to training (3 months ago).\n\nWell I went to the store yesterday and left the baby with my husband. When I got home the baby was in his crib and the dog was up on the bed snuggling up with my husband, while peeking over him and eye balling the crib, whining (the crib is attached to our bed). I immediately lost my shit and screamed at him to get the dog off the fucking bed. I then accused him of deliberately enabling the dogs dangerous behavior, which the trainers and vets have already stated is resource guarding and is a very big issue. He retorted with \"she's probably fucking acting like this because she wants more attention since she **hardly** gets it now that the baby is here\". To say that's utter bullshit is an understatement. If anything since we had the baby the dog is constantly on my husband's lap now and is never alone. I told him if he kept wanting to pull this shit than I can take the baby and go to a safe environment so he can give the dog all the attention she wants. He says I'm an AH for \"neglecting the dogs emotional needs\". AITA?\n\nEdit: spelling.

It's dangerous and the childs safety trumps the dog being in the bed every time. He really needs to get his priorities straight.", "NTA - He wanted the dog, he needs to look after the dog, including making sure it has proper emotional support. He's now not caring for your baby. Sounds like weaponised incompetence to me. He didn't take care of his child while he was meant to be on duty. There's no way he's going to be an equal parent without serious intervention.", "NTA. I commend you for the amount of patience you've had up until this point.\n\nYour husband needs a reality check; he is doing like you said, he's enabling her bad behavior. He is practically rewarding it by saying if you whine enough, jump on the bed, you will be rewarded with cuddles and me giving you attention rather than the baby. It's not the dog's fault in all honesty, dogs are molded by their environment.\n\nYour husband needs to learn he is enabling her, and of course, your dog may not be getting the attention she once did before the baby, that's to be expected. You literally have a new priority in the house. I'm not saying you will ignore the dog but it's clear the baby is your number one, and your baby shouldn't be cast aside to give the dog attention purely because she is feeling that is is entitled to it and/or knows your husband will give into her jumping on the bed and whining. He needs to be at this training lessons for your dog to see how she acts around others, then reflect why she acts this specific way with him. Your husband needs to be trained more or less. \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: Husband is TA, he needs to see how this can potentially turn into a dangerous situation for not only him or you, but also your baby. Your dog has seemed to realize that the baby is the number one priority in the house and is feeling jealous, so if given the opportunity she MAY lash out at the baby or even you/him. You are completely justified in removing yourself AND your baby from this situation that can turn dangerous faster than believed if he doesn't get his shit in gear.", "NTA. Your husband needs to set some physical boundaries with the dog.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, it sounds like your husband is determined to make your home a dangerously unsafe environment for your baby.  Please do take action.", "NTA 1000\u00d7 over. No dog on the bed was the rule from the get-go. If he wanted to give the dog attention, he could have gotten his ass up & taken the dog to an appropriate place for it. He just reinforced a bad & potentially dangerous behavior with the dog. \n\nHe needs to agree to take this seriously & follow the trainer's instruction to a T. You may want to get an in home trainer as well... some people are better trained with visuals & specifics \"Under no circumstances is this dog allowed on that bed.\" Coming from the trainer it may sink in to his skull.\n\nYou need to get him to understand that his lack of attendance to this matter may lead to serious injury to your daughter & the dog's death. If your daughter shows up at the ER needing stitches from a dog bite, the authorities will step in & neither one of you will have control of the situation. & I'd tell him my self if the dog harms the baby in any way, you'll take the baby & leave. \n\nSome people just do not understand the seriousness of an untrained dog until it is way too late.", "Put the husband in a kennel training program. Put the dog outside in the shed. For every minute the dog spends on the bed, the husband has to sleep in the kennel for an hour and the dog has to be outside the house. Best way to train both.", "NTA\n\nMaybe yelling was not the best way to prove your point.\n\nI love dogs. However dogs are naturly animals wich need to have set boundairies. Certainly if you have an alfa dog (and it seems like it) the dog will try to get higher in the hierarchy. The dog has to learn that every family member is higher in the hierarchy as him/her. Otherwise there is a chance that it even could become dangerous for your baby.\n\nPersonaly I would never let a dog even in the bedroom. Only for hygiene reasons alone I wouldn't let a dog in the bedroom. In my opinion the place of a dog is the livingroom and the hallways. I let a dog only on the sofa when he/she gets permision. In all other cicumstances its forbidden. \n\nJust like childeren , dogs like clarity. It will be confusing if the dog is sometimes forbidden to do something and sometimes is punished for the same thing.", "NTA. Your husband is bonkers if he doesn't see the danger in this situation. I am a HUGE dog lover, my 14 year old pup is my son to me but no fucking way would I ever allow such a thing. You might have to make good on your statement and leave with the baby.", "NTA \n\nThe only thing I wish you would have done differently is not yell around the baby. You\u2019re a new mom though, so I totally understand that you are probably at your wits end and just lost it. Otherwise, your explanation and reasoning is absolutely justified. I would be super pissed too. Maybe I relate because my husband is also an enabler of poor pup behavior, but he needs to learn quickly that what he is doing is not acceptable.\n\nHave you two considered couples counseling to talk through how his choices are impacting his relationship with you and will also impact his relationship with your kid?", "I cant understand why he is placing the dog above both you and his child. A very red flag in my opinion.", "NTA. Your husband is actively undermining all the training you\u2019re giving the dog and enabling her behavior toward the baby. This will only embolden her and it\u2019ll most likely grow into aggression toward the baby. It\u2019s not safe.", "NTA. That is not an excellent mixture of breeds to have around small kids. This dog is going to have a natural instinct to herd this baby when it becomes mobile. That herding can include nips and bites to 'guide' the herd. In everyone's best interest, this dog should be rehomed with people that can engage her natural instincts while training out the resource guarding. She sounds bored, confused and under enriched as well as stressed. You are also stressed with a newborn. Id do exactly as you did in your position, leave with the baby until the dog is in a proper home/foster/rescue. This isn't your fault or hers. I am so sorry you all are going through that.", "NTA\n\nDoes he not understand that dogs need consistency in order to learn. If the dog is allowed on the bed sometimes, it will never learn to stay off of it. It sounds like your husband doesn't really agree with the rules and isn't willing to enforce them if you aren't there. \n\nHe needs to stop looking at this situation from the perspective of caving in because it's what the dog wants and start looking at it from the standpoint of the fact that he is breaking your agreements. He isn't taking the whole thing seriously. \n\nThere are plenty of ways to train the dog, but if you can't depend on your husband to present a unified front in that training, it likely won't work.", "This is not going to end well. The dog is jealous of the baby and ALL the behavior needs to be addressed, not just the bed thing. \n\nOur Corso (huge, 130lbs) can get jealous of my son (3yo). It's not a dangerous jealousy tho, he just nudges in between me and my son at times or pees on my son's toys. \n\nBecause our dog is so big he has a shock collar (I know it's controversial, but even with how well he's trained if he happens to get a wild hair and run out the door after some neighbor, at 130lbs it's hard to stop him). We have taught him that when he hears the tone (there's a button that makes a tone beep) he immediately recalls, sits pretty, and gets a treat. \n\nThere also a buzz option that serves as a warning. When he gets buzzed he stops what he's doing and goes back to the kennel. \n\nNow the actual shock, doesn't hurt; I've worn it to make sure. He only gets that if he's legitimately not listening and acting up. Literally only gets shocked once every few weeks is so rare. \n\nBut this is a good training tool when used correctly. \n\nNTA", "NTA and show him these answers.\n\n\nComing from someone who volunteered in a veterinary clinic and someone whose friends dogs had this behavior. **This is extremely dangerous**. This dog could be a danger to the baby. A friend of my parents had a baby chihuahua, he acted like your dog sometimes, but not very often so the woman chose to let it go (after several rounds of training) and thought this would pass or it's something to do with the dog's personality. After a couple of months she were holding the baby and he was holding the dog on the couch, OUT OF NOWHERE he tried to attack the baby. The baby had a bite on the cheek and some scratches because the dad could hold the dog in time. **This isn't a joke or something you can risk** THIS IS YOUR CHILD'S SAFETY and he is playing fast and lose and **PRIORITIZING THE DOG**.\n\nBesides all of this dogs need rules and he keeps breaking them when you are not there. That way he is undermining you and the dog **will never learn**. Does he plan to do this with your child too? You say no and he goes behind your back? **He is actively harming his dog** (he doesn't understand rules because of him), **you** (undermining you and disregarding your concerns and emotions) **and your child** (prioritizing the dog over them and not being concerned over their safety). He is a bad dog owner.\n\nI adore dogs and animal with all my heart. But they are animals at the end of the day. Certain things they can't understand and **we** as their owners and family are responsible for training them and **making sure** they adhere to boundaries and safety. Otherwise, this is an unfit owner and the dog is best elsewhere. \n\nI can't believe I have to say this **you child** should be the priority. Not the dog.", "NTA why doesn\u2019t he care about the safety of your child? major red flag", "NTA, not even close. I understand that he loves the dog and that she is having a hard time adjusting to the baby, but your baby NEEDS to be a priority. Safety aside, that\u2019s VERY disrespectful of him to ignore your one wish and have the dog on the bed in your absence. Also your husband isn\u2019t doing the dog any favors by actively undoing her training and confusing her about the bed. Sounds like maybe your husband is one one feeling emotionally neglected and is projecting it on the dog.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How many times have you heard a friend say they told their spouse a thing repeatedly to no avail, then one day the spouse's FRIEND says the same thing & it's a life-changing revelation to the spouse?\n\nGet the in house trainer. Get help from your sister (sil?) who has the well trained dog. If he has a good friend that would be understanding, get help from them. If he's hearing the same message from other people in his life, his ears may suddenly unclog. Sure, it shouldn't be like this, but you don't have time to work thru that particular (& not uncommon) lack of respect in therapy. He & the dog need to be trained yesterday. The dog will undoubtedly be easy to train once your husband is on board. The dog is getting mixed messages... so don't lose faith that this dog might not be your daughter's best friend! You just need to get Dad's head out of his butt so that can happen!"]}
