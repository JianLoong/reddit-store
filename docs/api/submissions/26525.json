I would lay money that this is not the only horrible thing she has done to you. \n\nDo you live with her? You need to leave so you can live your own life and start researching online about narcissistic parents, narcissists love to ruin special occasions for their victims.

You still live at home, so a compromise is possible where your mum gets a sitter for the afternoon/ evenings (so it doesn\u2019t interfere with your work). But it is a stretch that your mum should have to hire 100% care and overnight care when you, a capable and trustworthy adult sibling, don\u2019t want to be bettered even though you live / sleep there too. ESH because you both are taking an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach. \n\nI also think that your 23rd birthday is not enough of an excuse on its own to say \u201cno\u201d if you are still living there. Adulthood involves people planning holidays when work allows for such, the timing isn\u2019t great but nothing is preventing you from celebrating on a different day versus two adults coordinating their schedules and accommodation availability and perhaps it only works during that specific time.", "This holiday was booked without my mum consulting with me if it was okay for her to book it or even ask if i had plans. She booked this holiday for her boyfriends birthday. \n\nJust because I am my mums adult child it doesn't mean i have to look after my younger sisters for two weeks on my birthday while my mum is gone celebrating someone else's and expects me to do it fornfree.", "You are correct that you are technically not obligated to do anything you do not want to do. \n\nHowever, morally, if you want full autonomy to make your own plans without ever being obliged to do anything for others that comes with a cost: be fully independent of your mum and move out.", "Morally her mom is an AH for even suggesting something that stupid."]}
