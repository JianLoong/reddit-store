That makes you even more of an AH because now the brother will be disappointed and maybe upset with his sister.

She didn't choose to have a sibling.\n\nAnd let your son learn to do things on his own too.

Kid?\n\nIf you want to flex your creativity, why wouldn't you help your younger kid with a project of his own? Competition opens minds.", "YTA. This is the sort of stuff that drives wedges in between family members, not build bonds. It was nice of your daughter to include her brother, and it was even ok for you to ask if he could have a slightly bigger part.

You took away her control if HER project.\n\nI'm curious. Have you done this type of thing, making her include her brother, in any of HER projects?", "Yta - you just took over her project and decided how she should do it. You are so wrong here.

It was your daughter's and you stepped into asshole territory when you fought her decision and pressured her into changing the script.

It\u2019s not your project - stay out of it. It\u2019s rude and an AH move to force your daughter to include him in any capacity and will likely breed resentment between the two of them", "YTA.

Back off.", "Yeah, YTA\u2026 let this girl do her thing.  She put her brother in it, be happy with that.

You have a 15 yr old aspiring filmmaker of a daughter, and a 9 yr old aspiring \"actor\" of a son (who likes to play act with his toys).  This was your daughter's project, which I'm sure meant the world to her.  She worked hard on it, and is obviously pretty talented as she won a grant for it!  \n\nSo, why did you hijack her project by asserting pressure and control on her, strong arming her into including her 9 yr old kid brother (playing with his dinosaurs) because YOU thought it was a great idea?!!!!!  You took the spotlight away from your daughter, instead of giving her 100% of your support and credit for HER creativity and hard work!  \n\nYou are a very selfish and manipulative person, and you need to step back and allow your children the freedom to grow and blossom in their own right!  Huge difference between a 15 yr old's aspirations and the dreams of a 9 yr old!\n\nYou owe your daughter an apology for meddling in a place you had no right to be.", "You took over your daughter\u2019s project and forced her to do things she didn\u2019t want to do.

YTA.", "YTA. I have many choice words for you but all I\u2019ll say is, your poor daughter.", "YTA.", "I hope she scraps the the ending and does what she wants. YTA, this was *her* project.

The grant was for her", "YTA - It may have been one thing if *she* had written a line to be recited by a boy under 10, and you suggested her brother to save on the cost of another actor.\n\nBut it seems like you just made an edit to her script/vision, because you saw it as an exposure opportunity for your son. And this irritated her, rightfully so.", "So let\u2019s paraphrase: your daughter won a grant, you pushed your way into editing HER project then bullied her into giving your son a speaking part, ask if your the AH and when anyone says you are you continue to tell them they are wrong.

This is her script and her vision and you essentially bulldozed over it.\n\nYes, you spent extra money for audition room, photographer and other stuff\u2026 but you would have done that anyway because you are a supportive parent.

YOU decided it could have a different ending and that ending would be an opportunity for your golden child to get some screen time.", "YTA. And it seems like you're not listening to what anyone is saying (and you're not willing to, either-- as you did in your post), so why bother even asking?", "Yta- it\u2019s not about you or your son, this is her thing, let her have it. The fact that you\u2019ve been supportive financially is irrelevant, either support her because you ARE a supportive parent and want to invest in the person she is going to be, or don\u2019t. But the money doesn\u2019t give you rights to her creative vision.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is her own person with her own voice.

Be better and learn from this, you are the only asshole in this situation.", "YTA for not letting your daughter have individual accomplishments that don\u2019t include her brother. They\u2019re not a package deal and if she wanted him in the film, she\u2019d have put him in with a speaking role from the get-go. Your children do not have to share everything they do. They are individuals and deserve to have things that are theirs and theirs alone. \n\nYou\u2019re doing your son a disservice by letting him piggyback off of his sister\u2019s hard work, and disrespecting your daughter\u2019s vision by forcing her to include her brother when she didn\u2019t want to. Seems like you have a clear favorite, and it isn\u2019t your daughter.", "YTA because I believe your intentions are misguided.

But what\u2019s not ok is strong arming your daughter to utilize the fruits of her labor and adjust the vision of her creativity to include her brother if that wasn\u2019t her original intent. She did promise to include him in the next project so she wasn\u2019t going out of her way with a hard pass and you should have respected that. \n\nI really do think your heart was in the right place and you just went about it wrong.

This was your daughters project, one in which she won a prize on her own to actually do.  As a good parent, you helped proved the means to get HER idea's on film.  Shoving her brother in on it takes away from her to what benefit?  Siblings DO NOT always have to share.

Please let your daughter do her thing.", "Yes, YTA", "YTA. But I\u2019m gonna give insight as an artist myself. Not from the perspective of child-parent.\n\nI was an art kid and did years of film, writing, theatre and such. \n\nBy insisting she adds her brother where she doesn\u2019t want him, need him, or envision him you\u2019re teaching her to change her artistic vision to fit other\u2019s needs. This hinders her artistic expression and her personal style which are vital in a persons art. Also, if she ends up in the industry it\u2019ll be harder for her to stand out due to the pressures of people pleasing and she could end up producing mediocre consumerism movies because her expression was limited as a kid.\n\nTake your son to a local theatre to strengthen his talents if you want to invest in him. There are ways to balance both of your children\u2019s interests without combining them. He may not like the same genre she likes and they could end up hindering each other. You wouldn\u2019t see Will Ferrel in a serious movie, and you wouldn\u2019t ask Tim Burton to create a comedy. Even if their styles are similar, or they like to cross genres, they are practicing different mediums and are years apart in terms of technical skill. It\u2019s just not fair all around to pretend like you know best for them and their art because no one but the artist knows best even if the artist is still learning because art is subjective. They might not fulfill each other\u2019s needs in terms of collaboration within art. Taylor Swift collaborated with Bon Iver but she did it on her alternative album, not her pop album, because he doesn\u2019t make that music. But there was a project she wanted him on because his vision for his projects aligned with her vision for that project in particular.\n\nAnd by combining them you take away the value of their individualism within their art and in turn themselves because art is an expression of who they are. So what you deem as harmless is actually limiting something very valuable. Art is supposed to push limits, that\u2019s what makes it unique and good. But by telling your daughter how to portray her art your limiting her and taking away her ability to look beyond the boxes you place before her.\n\nI understand wanting to give your children equal opportunity but I promise this isn\u2019t the way to make them feel seen independently and valued for their differences. I\u2019d recommend doing some research on the differences and similarities in art, particularly the ones they like. There are accounts on YouTube that break down film and acting that I watch all of the time. Some may be a bit hard to follow but others might bring a lot of perspective to how different and difficult each of these expressions are and how you can best support your children. I hated asking my parents for help or their opinions on art because they could never understand it from the viewpoint of an artist, but if you want to help and give opinions you have to take the time to understand it so they hold more value to the artist you give them to.

You stink at parenting.", "are you going to do her science projects for her too?  if she wants to be a filmmaker let her make her own films.  you're not the director.  she's the director.  you're the producer.  stay in your lane.", "You\u2019re an asshole.

Have you considered that you guilted or forced her hands into adding that scene. If you can\u2019t handle the truth why ask?", "You are the one that is short-sighted. YTA.  You took ownership away from your daughter.  Why would you feel the need to meddle in her dream, her work and her project?  I feel for her. You forced her to go back and re-shoot. It is BS, that she agreed.  You pushed and forced.  It is no longer her project. Congrats on the complete lack of self-awareness.  I bet you are voted overwhelming, Ahole and will try to disagree.", "It\u2019s her project. Her idea, her script, her vision. Stay out of it.", "Whoosh!\n\nPoint totally missed. \n\nETA: YTA. Your children need to experience individuality and be allowed to enjoy their own successes. Your daughter won an award for *her* passion. Let her enjoy it.

A story about a kid from Oakland, who played football and just happened to take a writing course. Turns out he was REALLY good, and was told to explore screenwriting. So he grew up went to USC and started making short films. He makes friends with a foreign exchange student, a musician also attending USC, and they begin to collaborate a lot. Years later, their work get the attention of Forest Whittaker, and the kid had his big breakthrough.\n\nYou wanna know who this kid was? Award-winning filmmaker Ryan Coogler. You, know from \"Fruitvale Station\", \"Creed\" and the cultural phenomenons that are the Black Panther movies. that foreign exchange student? Ludwig Goransson, who has written scores for Marvel, Star Wars, and Nolan Films. He produced a lot of Childish Gamibino's work (because he met him while they worked on Community together), including \"This is America\". Coogler has won awards at Cannes and Sundance BECAUSE of his humble little projects and WILLING collaborations. Everyone starts somewhere.\n\nAnd you, in your efforts to uplift one of your kid's art, are diminishing the creative control of your other kid. What you are doing is the equivalent of a studio shoehorning in something that a director doesn't want. As well as putting down how important it is to her. YTA. Do you understand how shortsighted YOU are being?", "I see your short sightedness.", "The fact that you got defensive instead or taking very good advice from someone who had the same things happened to them show you don't want to listen, you just want to be right. So why did you bother to make a post then? You're going to ruin the relationship between them by forcing them together. And you are very clearly favoring one over the other.

And now its not, now it's about your little boy.", "Why ask if yta then get upset about someone explaining why yta.\n\nYTA: Essentially what previous comments have said.

This is fucking ART.  If she was a painter, would you let her brother paint a small corner?  If she was a musician, would you force a 5 second kazoo solo upon her?  I hope not.

YTA.", "YTA your situation isn't better", "What part of this is HER project, HER prize don\u2019t you understand??", "You are a horrible parent. This person spelled it out for you, and your response is that this isn't about them? You miss the part of school where EXAMPLES are used? YTA.", "YTA YTA YTA \n\nIt was her project, her say.

I have no doubt that you treat your daughter with the same disrespect", "You should be ashamed of yourself. For one thing, this was your daughter's time to shine, not her brother. Second, her brother could have very well ruined your daughter's vision. Third, you made it seem that you helping her was conditional on her helping her brother.", "YTA You say there was no harm, but the artist who\u2019s vision it was felt that it made her project worse. Don\u2019t do that, let her create!", "I see a parent that does not accept their child\u2019s declination and instead pushes to get their way into something that is HER creation and vision. Why is it so hard for a parent to accept a \u201cno\u201d from their kid? She didnt want to and you made her. This is poor parenting.

Sadly, it wasn't a two way street, and I'd be willing to say it isn't in your house, either.
