My son is turning four next week and thus his party is planned. Its a pretty simple party - bluey themed. He's excited beyond belief.\n\nAnyway, I was going through invites with my sister in law. I have twenty kids coming. My older sister knew about the party but I'd already told her it was just for kiddos nursery friends (and their older siblings, but their parents are paying their way), hence her son not being invited.\n\nWhich, by the way, is true. My SILs daughter just happens to attend the same nursery. My sisters son doesn't. \n\nSomehow she found out that her son was the \"only one\" not invited. Theres only the three kids in the family in the same age bracket, so she is technically correct. But I reiterated that it was for the nursery kids and it wasn't something personal.\n\nShe kept pushing and insisted I make an exception. I disagreed but she wouldn't let it go. \n\nTruthfully I didn't want him there for a multitude of reasons; my nephew is a sweet boy on his own. Force him to share, or wait, or play with other kids and he's an absolute terror. Screaming, scratching, biting. \n\nI don't want that behavior at my sons party and so I eventually told her so. She got quite upset and asked why her son specifically. All kids throw tantrums and that. \n\nI told her it was because he had no siblings or regular playdates. He can't share. He has his mom 24/7, never told to wait, and it makes him unpleasant to be around. \n\nI'd also like to say that I've never seen behaviour like it before. I'm no expert, but I have four kids, my SIL has six, and never once has there been a tantrum like that among them. And my nephew has them two or three times a day.\n\nAnyway, I ended up closing the conversation down because it was getting out of hand and I didn't think it was that serious. \n\nShe went back to our mom, who is now telling me I should invite my nephew just to keep the peace, offering to come herself to keep an eye on him if I'm that nervous. To me, thats not the point. \n\nIf I don't want a badly behaved child ruining my sons party so what? I feel like thats a normal boundary to have.\n\nAm I really that much of an asshole here? She's acting like I've ostracised her kid from the family indefinitely. \n\nSide note - we are having a family get together too. So they will see my son and spend time with him. I just don't want him at the party.", "created_utc": 1688144095, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n5rcf/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_only_child_isnt/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t take the chance of him ruining your sons birthday just because you\u2019re being pressured to let him come", "NTA\n\nBehavior has consequences.  It sounds like your SIL thinks her kid's violent, out of control behavior and tantrums are just normal behavior for a little kid.  From what you're describing, they're not.  And if your mom  is offering to come and supervise him as a possible solution, it sounds like your SIL doesn't intervene or make effective attempts to control her son.\n\nYou gave your SIL a very honest, unvarnished explanation of why her kid isn't invited.  I wish she had listened to you, and I wish she'd enlist the assistance of a child therapist to give her kid some coping strategies, and giver her some parenting strategies.\n\nOnly children don't typically scratch and bite others, melting down in a violent frenzy several times a day.  Of course you don't want this at your son's birthday.", "NTA your kid your party.

Nope!", "NTA\n\nIt would be one thing if the child was just struggling to cope and had unpleasant behavior that annoyed but did not harm others, but physical violence against other children is different.  If your nephew hurts other kids in order to get his way, then having him at the party is asking for a child to get injured as soon as nephew decides he wants to play with something another child has, doesn't want to wait for a turn on the slide, etc. etc.  And who knows which child it will be.  It could be your nephew who is hurt when he bites/scratches a child and their older sibling reacts or bites/scratches the wrong child and they retaliate.  \n\nYour nephew's behavior, unfortunately, creates unsafe situations for both himself and for other children.  It's unfortunate that this is causing him to be left out, but that's what's going to happen until your sister gets his behavior under control.", "NTA. For me the deciding factor was that you finally told your sister the real reason the kid isn't coming; he misbehaves. So she knows exactly why he's being \"singled out.\" She doesn't have to like your reasons, but it is your party, and as you say there's another family gathering as well so he'll be at that.", "NTA. Any good mother would be upset at their own child\u2019s exclusion from another child\u2019s social event. Then again, any good mother would ensure their child is taught how to be respectful and how to get along with others. It\u2019s sad this is the way your sister has to have her eyes (hopefully) forced open, but she really needs to step her parenting up or her son will be excluded from many, many more parties for many, many years by every other child he comes in contact with.\n\nAnd anyone who is a parent knows that offers to watch a child are never followed through on 100%. Your mother may start off watching him, but she will slip or hand him off to someone else \u201cfor just a minute,\u201d and the little brat will immediately ruin your son\u2019s birthday.", "NTA he\u2019s a brat and she doesn\u2019t control him", "NTA.

He's at the age where he is going to start getting excluded from things because of his behavior.\n\nCuz yes, someone can remove him from the room but (1) while yes tantrums happen they impact how much other kids want to play with tantrum kid in general and (2) your son's birthday party isn't the time to start practicing things like removing nephew from the room.\n\nBut also this isn't going to get better. And nephew is going to start school and not understand why the other kids don't want to be his friend. And ultimately, that will be your sister's fault. She has to do the things now to help him learn how to play with other kids.\n\nDo I prefer family members being honest about young kids behavior? Yes, but I get going for the easy lie.", "NTA invite him only if grandma shadows him and agrees to take him out if he tantrums. I can tell you that if it happens, just tell parents he is family and you love him lots but he has...issues. people understand", "You're not exactly an AH but it is a dick move to ostracize a preschooler for the failings of the adults in their life.", "NTA Please don't run every single one of their child's birthdays with your poorly behaved nephew. Your SIL is experiencing the consequences of poor parenting.  She can throw her own party for him.", "I'm going to get downvoted for this for sure, but honestly YTA for trying to hide the real reason for not wanting to invite your nephew behind the excuse that he's not part of the same nursery. That's clearly not the issue. Obviously, it's your son's party, so you don't have to invite anyone you don't want to, but it's seems a bit unfair to exclude such a little kid from the party on the basis of behavior you think is a result of him not having enough social interaction with other kids. If he starts being disruptive at the party, ask your sister to take him home. But he's only four, and if the problem is that he hasn't had enough socialization with other kids, it seems kinda harsh to not even give him a chance.", "ESH - I get not wanting him there but blaming it on him being an only child is pretty shitty. All that only child syndrome crap has been disproven.", "You say that your nephew is in the same age bracket as the other children... How old is he exactly? \n\nI'm just curious because biting is a normal childhood development - usually between the ages of 1-3 though.", "YTA\n\nYou are teaching your son that it\u2019s okay to ostracize his cousin. You are not giving your nephew a chance to feel included. For an only child who has no siblings, the closest peers are their cousins. Being cut off from your son\u2019s party *is* a big deal, regardless of your intent.\n\nPlease, accept grandma\u2019s help and relent.", "YTA.  It's your party, so you do you, but you're still an asshole about it.", "YTA- how would u feel if someone did this to your kid? It\u2019s quite disgusting that you\u2019ve not even thought about how yr nephew might feel.  Awful behaviour from a family member.", "I\u2019m confused as to why you lied to your sister about the reason her kid isn\u2019t invited. Saying \u201cit\u2019s nothing personal, blah blah\u201d might seem more polite, but \u201csister, your son\u2019s behavior ruins parties and it needs to change before I\u2019m comfortable inviting him\u201d is really reasonable\u2014and in my opinion, it\u2019s kinder in the long run to just be honest. Also, if you\u2019d ultimately like your nephew to change his behavior, excluding him socially and letting him know why is going to accomplish that goal better than just excluding him socially.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real, if every kid in the family around your son\u2019s age is invited except this one cousin, that looks bad and we can\u2019t pretend your sister is crazy for noticing this and having hurt feelings about it, especially if you\u2019re hiding behind the \u201cit\u2019s nothing personal\u201d spiel. So you\u2019re definitely not an asshole for not wanting this kid at the party, but I\u2019m going with ESH because this lie is unnecessary and will cause more hurt and resentment in the long run than if you just told the truth.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I doubt he even knows what's going on.\n\nBy the way, what do you suggest OP do?", "I see what you mean but from the sounds of it, it seems like it will be inevitable that nephew will throw a tantrum. If he can't share or interact well with other kids, a party with 20 other kids is not the place to start more socialization. Birthday parties focus on one person with a birthday, which means it will be centered around OP's kid. If nephew can't handle sharing or not being the center of attention, that will be a MAJOR problem at a birthday party.\n\nETA: It's not OP's responsibility to make sure nephew can have socialization. That would be his mom's job and it sounds like she has not done a good job. Also, inviting nephew is a risk to the other kids and their parents. OP said he will SCRATCH and BITE.

She's blaming the parenting, because that's what makes a kid like that, the parents.", "\"If you don't allow a terrible kid who SCRATCHES AMD BITES\" to ruin your son's birthday you're teaching him to be mean\"\n\nShut up, teaching a kid that he has to invite someone who physically harms other kids is ass backwards.\n\nI don't know if it's because you were a terrible biting kid or are the parent to one but wrong.

I agree with you, this is extreme and I\u2019ve known a lot of 4 yos over the years, including some ADHD/neuroatypical kids that tantrumed but not as you\u2019ve described in terms of intensity and frequency. In my family biting was always trained out by 2 or earlier because it is so potentially serious. \n\nAnyway, I feel like there are two issues here - one being he\u2019s not invited to this party (NTA) and the second being whether you can/want to get your sister to realize this possibility and that he needs to be evaluated and maybe get help for something, possibly develop an IEP or a diagnosis before he starts regular school. He doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s very happy, honestly.", "Oh hello assumptions. I was neither of those people, but I did have a decade-long career in early childhood development.\n\nOP is operating on the kid\u2019s past behavior, which (at that age) is not an accurate predictor of future reactions to new events.\n\nThe kid has to experience positive reinforcement for making good choices, so he needs that opportunity to make them.\n\nA solid compromise here would be: nephew\u2019s mom and grandma keep all eyes on him at all times and the *second* he touches another kid, he is gone \u2013 no warning, no argument, just remove him from the situation.\n\nJust him being there does not equal to other kids getting hurt, and that\u2019s a damaging message to send him without any chance of remedial action.", "Fair to whom? If this was \u201cfriends only, no cousins\u201d that would probably be more palatable to your sister and nephew. This is specifically singling him out based on your expectations of his behaviors.

It\u2019s really sad that his own aunt can write him off altogether at such a young age. Grandma has offered to manage his behavior that day.", "It is different, he\u2019s yr nephew and he\u2019s in the same age group\u2026gross.", "Having a child THAT aggressive towards other kids when they don't get their way, is honestly a law suit waiting to happen. If he scratches or bites the wrong kid or seriously hurts someone.", "It's not fair to the other kids at the party.", "You know what is gross? Raising a child that physically hurts other children when they don\u2019t get their way. You know what else is gross? The extreme entitlement that people have these days that their \u201cprevious little angels\u201d need to always be included.\n\nNTA, OP. And hopefully this is an eye open for your sister that she needs to help your nephew learn better ways to express himself and deal with his emotions. Correcting the issue now, will lead to him being included for future events."]}
