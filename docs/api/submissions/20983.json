My son is turning four next week and thus his party is planned. Its a pretty simple party - bluey themed. He's excited beyond belief.\n\nAnyway, I was going through invites with my sister in law. I have twenty kids coming. My older sister knew about the party but I'd already told her it was just for kiddos nursery friends (and their older siblings, but their parents are paying their way), hence her son not being invited.\n\nWhich, by the way, is true. My SILs daughter just happens to attend the same nursery. My sisters son doesn't. \n\nSomehow she found out that her son was the \"only one\" not invited. Theres only the three kids in the family in the same age bracket, so she is technically correct. But I reiterated that it was for the nursery kids and it wasn't something personal.\n\nShe kept pushing and insisted I make an exception. I disagreed but she wouldn't let it go. \n\nTruthfully I didn't want him there for a multitude of reasons; my nephew is a sweet boy on his own. Force him to share, or wait, or play with other kids and he's an absolute terror. Screaming, scratching, biting. \n\nI don't want that behavior at my sons party and so I eventually told her so. She got quite upset and asked why her son specifically. All kids throw tantrums and that. \n\nI told her it was because he had no siblings or regular playdates. He can't share. He has his mom 24/7, never told to wait, and it makes him unpleasant to be around. \n\nI'd also like to say that I've never seen behaviour like it before. I'm no expert, but I have four kids, my SIL has six, and never once has there been a tantrum like that among them. And my nephew has them two or three times a day.\n\nAnyway, I ended up closing the conversation down because it was getting out of hand and I didn't think it was that serious. \n\nShe went back to our mom, who is now telling me I should invite my nephew just to keep the peace, offering to come herself to keep an eye on him if I'm that nervous. To me, thats not the point. \n\nIf I don't want a badly behaved child ruining my sons party so what? I feel like thats a normal boundary to have.\n\nAm I really that much of an asshole here? She's acting like I've ostracised her kid from the family indefinitely. \n\nSide note - we are having a family get together too. So they will see my son and spend time with him.

It could be your nephew who is hurt when he bites/scratches a child and their older sibling reacts or bites/scratches the wrong child and they retaliate.  \n\nYour nephew's behavior, unfortunately, creates unsafe situations for both himself and for other children.

Also, if you\u2019d ultimately like your nephew to change his behavior, excluding him socially and letting him know why is going to accomplish that goal better than just excluding him socially.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real, if every kid in the family around your son\u2019s age is invited except this one cousin, that looks bad and we can\u2019t pretend your sister is crazy for noticing this and having hurt feelings about it, especially if you\u2019re hiding behind the \u201cit\u2019s nothing personal\u201d spiel.

I\u2019ve been so happy the other parents still include him and are so patient with him sitting on the sidelines until he\u2019s ready. \n\nI also find (now that I\u2019m a parent) others tend to exaggerate how bad a kid misbehaves to justify exclusion.

I could not reasonably expect them to allow my child\u2019s inability to self-regulate to derail 20+ other children\u2019s instruction time and/or put themselves/his classmates at risk of bodily harm. As a result of these episodes, he was removed from the classroom multiple times. I would get called to come pick him up, and while it absolutely broke my heart, I never held it against the school. They bent over backwards to work with me, they helped me get him evals and develop a behavior plan, they expressed compassion and sympathy for our situation. Everyone truly liked my son, but none of us could wave a magic wand to just fix it. He has a diagnosis that makes this shit difficult. Nothing personal, just the truth.\n\n5 years later, he\u2019s doing better, but he\u2019s still an occasionally explosive kid. His episodes aren\u2019t violent anymore, but he still melts down at home and at school. I hate that his behavior (that is not truly within his control) singles him out and sets him apart from his peers, but he is finally starting to make friends and even receive birthday party invitations. As a mom who has been agonizing over and tirelessly advocating for my child for years, this is so very encouraging. But again, it\u2019s still not anyone\u2019s job to excuse his behavior, and it\u2019s definitely not anyone\u2019s job to tolerate a fairly predictable meltdown at their child\u2019s special event.

I also find it problematic when people start using how many times they've reproduced as some sort of qualification.

They think they've been around \"tons\" of kids because they have family. They think knowing children from one family constitutes a general knowledge of the broader populace.

This is also an inter family issue and we don't have any indication that OP doesn't have a long history of static with her older sister and isn't being highly biased in her description of her nephew's behavior. My assessment is really just based on the age of the children involved and how common the behaviors described actually are for that age group. OP is making mountains out of mole hills from my perspective, if anything my concern is that the sisters boy may need to be tested to see if he's on the spectrum.

OP wouldn't know that if she hadn't seen him around other kids, hence the post. I am also an educator, and understand early childhood development. I do not think it's true to say that at his age his past behavior is an inaccurate indicator of future behavior, because from everything OP has shared it is clear to me that this behavior either comes from the parenting (which likely didn't change since OP saw nephew last) or overstimulation (which definitely wouldn't have changed since OP saw nephew last). If it's the former I highly doubt the sister will agree to having her child removed from the party by Grandma if he acts out since it won't be fair to her precious angel, and if it's the latter I don't know if hypervigilance will do much if he isn't diagnosed with anything and Grandma/sister aren't informed on triggers to look out for to prevent overstimulation. I mean, just walking into the party of 20 other 3-4 year olds could be a LOT. Having him at the party is more than likely a lose-lose FOR the nephew (get in trouble with aunt and doesn't get to finish the party) and will do more damage to his relationship with the cousin in the long run.
