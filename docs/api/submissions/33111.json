It sounds like you feel he isn\u2019t pulling his weight and admittedly you are burnt out. You should have a discussion about distribution of responsibilities and finding ways to ease your stress. The watch is a minor problem, but it isn\u2019t the main problem. I think you feel under appreciated and stressed so it would be easier to fight about the watch but I think your problems are bigger than gift giving.

It seems off that he would work extra hours for no additional money. Also, he is using his overtime to intentionally stay away from the home most likely because of your child\u2019s behavioral problems. That is unfair to you.

Which came first?", "I agree. He needs to spend $200/week on therapy, not $200/year on watches. OP needs therapy too, to deal with how she feels about the financial costs of the watch and the cost of her husbands therapy. Therapy is available for a 10% discount at 1800THERAPY for the low low price of only $360/week for two whole hours of people listening to you whine! Daily therapy also available for even lower prices. All 1800THERAPY therapists are guaranteed to have either real estate licenses or associates degrees in something.", "No I think it means they'll pay a fraction of the price for 2 years that will be directly added to their phone bills. You can do that with buyinh new phones as well.", "I think she means financed rather than leased", "^^ Excellent question.", "How much this matters really depends on if the kid also needs expensive treatments, therapies, or interventions. Picking up hours or taking training to try and get a promotion (since he's salaried) makes sense if hes trying to increase his earning potential.", "And when it's half paid off, you can upgrade by turning in the old device and keep the same payment.", "Do you happen to have T-Mobile by any chance? That\u2019s a promotion they have going on. If you get the normal Apple Watch, you\u2019re in a 2 year contract and only pay for the service (you don\u2019t owe anything for the cost of the watch if you remain a customer for 2 years). The newer or bigger version (forgot the difference) you can get for a fraction of the cost over 2 years as well. So with this added context, I wonder how many items he\u2019s gifted you and gotten the exact same thing for himself\u2026but the better version of it. It may just be that he only gets gifts if he can get one for both of you at a discount or BOGO free. Have you talked to him about this? NTA by the way. I don\u2019t think your reaction was all that a-hole-ish.", "NTA, OP, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just him getting the same thing he got you.  It\u2019s just a straw that\u2019s breaking the camels back.  You are burnt out and struggling,  and the something nice he did for you seems now not as nice and special because he (who you don\u2019t view as struggling) went and got the same thing making it not as special.  Also instead of taking time and being with you and your child when he could he has used that time on himself.\n\nYou might be doing what I did or use to.  You do not let him know your feelings because you go oh but he\u2019s stressed for work.  Or well he tried.  Or ohh he has things going on and this won\u2019t last.  Or I can just do it.  You have to talk to them let him know how you feel what you need. That he has to be aware of what you are going through and be considerate to you as much as you are to him.  He maybe stressed due to work but you are as well at home.  Stop protecting him from your home stress and struggles.  Also let him know how his gifts make you feel, fist how happy and special but the fact he gets the better or same gift later for no reason makes it less so.  Because you only get it for special occasions and he gets it when ever, you who be able to get it when ever too.\n\nYou also have to sit him down and ask him why he has been working so much overtime? Why? Is it justified? Especially when it leaves you to hold up the household.  \n\nI\u2019m just hoping all that extra work time is not for something else non work related.", "Narcissist. My ex always gave me gifts, as long as he bought himself the same or better. \nHome: when his eye contact solution was getting to the bottom, he would give me his almost empty bottle and buy himself a new bottle. \nGet your finances in order and leave this chump! He will always take you for second best\u2026.. \nstart keeping a list of how he mistreats you. I bet after 6 mo you will have enough of your own reasons to leave him. \nPeople like this are better left alone.", "NTA, but i think you're focusing on the wrong thing. \n\npersonally, i'd be happy with whatever gift i received, even if it was an older version. him having something thats better than what you have isn't what you should be getting upset at. yeah, i understand how you might feel that your gift is less special now in a way, but at the end of the day you still have an apple watch that works. who cares which version it is. i think what you should be upset at is his lack of balance when it comes to his work life and his personal life. i get hes working long hours to have the finances needed to support the family, but you definitely shouldn't be the only one putting in the work and effort when it comes to your child. hes also their parent. if he has enough time and money to stop by the apple store and get himself the latest version of the apple watch, he should also have enough time and money to balance out his work and personal life.", "I agree, but he seems kind of weird and selfish with the gifts too.", "Na, if it's a lease, wait a few months and the new version will come out then upgrade to the top of the line in the newest version", "Yes, very true. He sounds self absorbed imo"]}
