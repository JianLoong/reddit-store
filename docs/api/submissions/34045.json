I've got a cousin named Rose (also 25F) who was around a lot growing up. Her mother (my aunt) is my mother's sister and they've always been super close, and my mom adores Rose and her siblings for some reason and we spent a lot of holidays and summers together when we were growing up\r  \n\r  \nThe thing is, Rose is crazy. Her brothers are fine, but Rose is crazy. Every time we were together she would have a meltdown and throw a temper tantrum if things didn't go her way and never made any sense.(ex: She would throw fits if we went to the beach, but also if she didn't go to the beach) She even broke some of my stuff. She just seems like a very unstable girl. We stopped spending so much time together when Rose's dad got a job in a different state and they moved away and couldn't afford to fly back as frequently.\r  \n\r  \nIt's been a while, and I still follow her on social media. She posts a lot of about mental heath stuff. She goes by a new name, has a new look, and she's even dating some guy. But I don't think it's authentic. I think she's trying to reinvent herself because she used to be such a brat and is trying to make people forget how she use to treat them. I'm pretty sure she has BPD.\r  \n\r  \nThis Christmas was at my mom's house and my fianc\u00e9 and I figured that we would hand out the wedding invites there and not risk them getting lost in the mail. Most people at Christmas got one, but Rose, naturally, wasn't invited. I don't want her ruining our special or anything. She was pretty mellow and was talking about her new job and stuff. She came up and told me that she noticed that her brothers had gotten an invite but I had forgotten to give her one. I told her I didn't think she would want to come, since when we used to get together nothing seemed right for her. She seemed really taken aback, apologized for how she used to act because she had \"a lot of stuff\" to deal with, and sad she was sorry that I didn't think she couldn't change from when she was a kid. I held firm because this is the first time she's EVER apologized to me for how she tried to ruin stuff and I think she was just trying to manipulate me into getting her way like she always used to.\r  \n\r  \nHer family realized that she had never gotten an invite, and one of her brothers called and asked why his sister wasn't invited. I reiterated that I didn't feel comfortable with a mentally unstable woman at my wedding and he got angry and said that I was stupid for being mad at something that happened \"so fucking long ago\" and that I was being ridiculous and bigoted and said he didn't want to come either and hung up. Then Rose's mom called my mom and said that if her daughter was the only family member not invited that she wasn't going to attend.\r  \n\r  \nNow my mom is upset that her sister and \"niblings\" (her word) aren't coming and begged me to just invite Rose. But you can't fully cure mental illness, and I don't want her coming and smashing my cake or something.

Scars can go deep, but while you\u2019re within your rights not to invite her, you went about excluding her in the most AH way possible.    No conversations about past behaviour and current health just straight mean-girl actions here.  You could have navigated this situation with kindness and choose poorly \n\nThe fall out you\u2019re getting was easily predicted, especially after the brutally honest conversation you had with her.   \n\nYour comments about her social media -that you still follow (? Wtf??) - are judgemental and rude.  I think you need to learn how to leave her behind and you haven\u2019t done that yet if you\u2019re following her on socials and obsessing about her life and struggles \n\nThat being said.  You were long overdue for an apology and it\u2019s telling that only when she was deprived of something that one was made.  Was it sincere(?)    Don\u2019t know   Don\u2019t care    It was forced by the situation you created so some ass-holery involved on the family\u2019s side there.  \n\nThe escalation of \u201cI\u2019m not going to the wedding -not surprising and demonstrating true negative family dynamics", "I feel sad for you because dealing with an awful kid is hard....I had to do it too.\n\nI think you are smart when you say she is still the same.....I have to agree.  Her mother is dealing with the lack of discipline Rose needed years ago.\n\nHold your ground. It's your wedding. If they don't want to go so be it.  \n\nAlso, if your mom is not paying for the wedding she needs to back off.  No one should force you into an uneasy situation on your wedding day. Best of luck to you both!", "YTA. \n\nNot because you didn't invite her. It's your wedding. You invite who you want. \n\nThe issue is your look on mental health. Saying she has BPD when you clearly don't know her at all. Unstable because she was clearly dealing with hormones and mental health? \n\nAnd accusing her of going to smash your wedding cake because you can't cure mental illness? I mean, come on. Mental illness doesn't mean crazy but that's clearly what you think it is. \n\nDo some research and realize a ton of people have mental issues. They aren't crazy.", "YTA, somewhat.\nYou are assuming she has not changed based on what? Do you know whether she has been doing things to get better? I understand your concerns but it might be fair to at least give her a chance to show you she has changed. You think she has bpd, this is a difficult disorder for the people around her but also for the person itself. And you are partially right, it is a disorder which people don't overcome but they can improve. Imagine she might have done a lot of work on herself but she still gets judged on past behaviour.", "Question -- can you invite her for the sake of family peace and hire security to escort out ANYONE who gets out of line?", "You handed out invitations in front of her?????? Nothing else in your story matters at that point. That's a dick move. YTA", "I don\u2019t think you handled this well at all.\n\nI broke the rule myself, but I did not single out just one person, but 1 uncle and his kids, and that included a cousin I actually wanted there. I gave my extended family a heads up before we even sent out save the dates, and explained that I didn\u2019t want to worry about uncle or his son assaulting family members like he has, multiple times in the past, referencing specific situations. \n\nAnd plenty of people may think I am still an AH, and it\u2019s all or nothing, but I at least tried and took measures. I didn\u2019t just expect them to be ok with it. I have been fully prepared for the consequences of my choice.", "YTA - it seems like Rose has been proactive in getting the help that she needed and is doing good.  Yet for some reason, you are holding her in her past light and are the AH for not letting her heal and become the person that she can be.\n\n*She goes by a new name, has a new look, and she's even dating some guy. But I don't think it's authentic. I think she's trying to reinvent herself because she used to be such a brat and is trying to make people forget how she use to treat them. I'm pretty sure she has BPD.*\n\nThis is what happens when a person with MH issues gets the help that they need and are doing better.  Who are you to say she has anything.  You're not a doctor or psychiatrist.  YOU are just making excuses which is what is making you TAH here.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's your wedding and your choice.  Just because it is your day, doesn't mean that anyone has to celebrate it with you because you're being an AH about it.", "YTA. You could have made your wedding a very small one, for immediate family only, so that you wouldn't be leaving only one person out.  Your extended family night have grumbled about it, but it wouldn't have caused this amount of distress and anger as it wouldn't have come across as such a personal rejection.", "NTA", "YTA for this alone: \" But you can't fully cure mental illness, and I don't want her coming and smashing my cake or something\"", "INFO: Have you had a conversation with anyone in the family about Rose in the last few years you've not been in touch? \n\nI ask because I'm curious to know if she now has a stable care team for her mental health or if she's in therapy and/or on meds. The thing about many mental illnesses is that you need the right combination of treatment and care. And that can take time to put together.\n\nI think it was insensitive for you to hand out invites in person while deliberately missing one person in the room. You could have had some conversations with her and her family before handing out invites.  However, I do think Rose should have apologized sooner. \n\nPeople do change (assume for a moment that Rose had changed). You're not required to mend anything with her. You're allowed to not invite her. But sounds like this is creating a rift between you and that side of the family. Not to mention creating friction with your mom on this topic. You do you, but just go into this with eyes wide open.", "YTA. You're allowed to have whoever you want at your wedding, but it was tacky and rude as hell to openly hand out invitations in front of others who weren't invited. And your attitude towards your cousin's mental health is rather problematic. For one thing, it's super uncool to label her as \"crazy\" if she has mental health issues. It's valid for you to be unhappy with her past behavior and actions towards you, and I'm sorry you had to deal with that. But what's not okay is to sneer at someone's attempt to clean up their lifestyle, and write off her ENTIRE LIFE as \"inauthentic\" because you have a narrative in your own mind. People can and do change, and I hope that, as a person who's supposedly mature enough to get married, you can learn to deviate away from labelling people who need help as \"crazy\" and \"unstable\".", "YTA. You admit you haven\u2019t spent time around her in a long time.  She was a kid when you had negative experiences with her, some examples you gave of her bad behavior seem, not very bad and pretty typical for a lot of kids and many out grow it.  What if everyone made snap judgements about you based on your childhood behavior.  Were you always perfect?  What if people judged you solely on those times in your childhood when you were at your worst. \n\nAnd you comment that this is the first time she has ever apologized.  But if you haven\u2019t seen her in awhile and never told her what was upsetting to you, when was she supposed to apologize and for what?\n\nPlus you are critical because she discusses mental health issues on Facebook.  Everyone has mental health issues, including you.  Many people ignore them.  And that leads to bigger problems.  If she is trying to heal from hers and be a better person, then she is doing a good thing.  Your statement about her FB page makes you sound at best judgemental, at worst, bigoted.\n\nShe may be crazy as a loon and cause a scene.  But you are assuming this on limited and dated opinions you formed as a child.  And you are willing to alienate the rest of your family, drive a wedge between your mother and her sister, because in your mind a grown woman who seems to be functioning in the world just fine now, was a brat when she was a kid?", "YTA. If you had concerns about Rose attending and were that set against it, there were discussions that could have been had before the invitations went out. \n\nIn your desire to save a little bit on postage costs, you threw the slight in her face as you went around, handing out invitations to everyone who was there except one person. Whatever your feelings are about her, it must have been humiliating to be singled out like that.", "YTA.  Normally I would say N-T-A due to the fact that it's your wedding and you ultimately control the guest list.  However, there was so much AH here that outweighs that and makes you TA.\n\n1. You're making assumptions about her mental health diagnosis, which sounds like it's not confirmed at all.\n2. You're going off of outdated information and behavior.  It sounds like you haven't been interacting with her much aside from stalking her SM.\n3. You think that she's manipulating you to go to your wedding like it's some big prize.  So her talk about mental health on her SM is some sort of long con??\n4. You think that mental illness can't be cured.  While it's true that some are very difficult to fully treat, that is largely untrue.\n5. You handed out invitations to a major event in front of people who weren't invited, which is both tacky and rude.\n6. You're surprised that her immediate family reacted poorly to items 1-5 which shows an AH level lack of awareness.", "YTA For thinking you can single out an individual in your family, exclude them from the guest list to your wedding and the rest of the family would think it was hunky dory.\n\n>It's been a while, and I still follow her on social media. She posts a lot of about mental heath stuff. She goes by a new name, has a new look, and she's even dating some guy. But I don't think it's authentic.

I'm pretty sure she has BPD.\n\nYou're very judgemental and disingenuous.", "YTA.\n\nThere's no evidence of her being an unstable adult. You're of course free to exclude whoever you want from your wedding, but inviting her whole family except for her was a shitty thing to do. \n\nAnd you deliberately did it as cruelly as possible, you  physically handed out all the invitations while she was right there. \n\nIt's hard to believe you're 25.", "NTA.   Your wedding, your guest list.", "You\u2019re not the asshole for not wanting her at your wedding, you\u2019re allowed to invite whoever you want to your wedding. YTA for how you handled it. You invited everyone publicly and singled her out by not including her. You should have done the invitations in private or even just given your family a heads up first, instead you blindsided everyone", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding. Your guest list. Just know that some people won\u2019t agree with you on your decisions and not attend. You have to live with that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
