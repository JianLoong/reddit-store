It's a promise. If you fuck around with my family dynamic between me and my daughter, you'll find out just how serious I am. I am perfectly comfortable cutting off toxic relationships that hinder my mental health and might mess with my daughter's emotional state. Trust me on this. I am not ready to move on. I might never be. And if you can't respect that, then I don't trust you to respect anything about MY family unit and maybe moving away would be best for us. Because frankly, I seem to be the only one actually considering our mental health and not just 'how it should be/how it should look'. If you cared a crap about me and my daughter, you'd listen to me. Not try to 'fix' something I don't want you to touch.\"", "NTA, while they may be worried about you, they are not you! Grief over a lost loved one never just 'goes away'. And about accepting the inevitable, again, they are not you.", "NTA and I am so sorry for your loss.  There is no time limit for grief and no need for you to move on in the way anyone else wants you to.  You have the love of your daughter, friends and family around you. A partner will come if and when you are ready.  In the meantime you are happy as you are. \n\nI'm afraid they will only up the ante now so time to mute their calls until they. Consider settling somewhere else, is moving closer to your wife's family an option?", "Oh HELL no. Ask for a new mommy for her birthday!?  Nope.\n\nI'm surprised you haven't already gone no contact after that comment.  That's just horrid.\n\nNTA... and I'm sorry for the loss of your wife.", "NTA. Don't threaten to leave again, just do it. Emotional manipulation of your child is just the beginning, and it won't get better because they don't think they're wrong.", "NTA, my god - how cruel to get your daughter involved. So much love to you.", "NTA your family is the asshole here. They might think they're trying to do a good thing, but they're hurting both you and your daughter in the process. You need to try to sit down with them and calmly tell them that bringing up another woman or anything of that nature is crossing a very serious line. Be totally firm and express to them the pain they're constantly causing you. Make it clear that if they do it again and in any way pressure your daughter to ask for something like a new mommy, then you will cut ties with them. It is non-negotiable. \n\nIf you ever decide to give another woman a chance in your life, then it's going to be because YOU want to and not to please your family or anyone else for that matter. Take all the time you need to not find a new wife, but to find your happiness and peace. I wish nothing, but the best for both you and your daughter.", "MTA, You should start getting ready to leave already tbh. Their reaction makes it clear as day they aren't gonna stop.", "NTA. Your family is the AH for trying to force you to move on with your life. Everyone grieves differently, and they should respect your wishes. \n\nI do hope that you will find your peace one day.", "NTA\u2014 I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. They\u2019ve had 5 years of you saying to leave you alone about this and refused to listen, and I agree that getting your daughter involved was cruel. It\u2019s an incredibly private thing whether a person is looking for a partner or not and it shouldn\u2019t be forced on people.

No one, not your parents, siblings, or even kids, can tell you when you're ready to even *consider* going out on *that* battlefield.  Your reaction is correct.  Hard, straightforward, and direct!  You just let them all know how serious you feel about this, and by going against your wishes on this issue, they better be ready for a serious response.", "NTA. You need to have a serious talk with them and put up some firm boundaries with consequences when broken. Using your daughter to manipulate you needs to be stomped out right now. Protect your daughter from these tactics. \n\nIf they don\u2019t listen at all and keep this up, do as you threatened and follow through.

I\u2019m sorry you lost your wife. Your family is out of line.", "NTA - Your family is messed up saying that to a 4 year old... Go NC and enjoy life with your daughter.", "NTA\nGrief is a funny thing. It affects people in so many different ways.  Your family is probably done with watching you grieve and they believe a new partner will wipe all the pain away...  But we know better don't we?  You can't replace those feelings your wife gave you,  nobody will give you the same looks she did,  or warm your heart the way she did, and that's ok.  You are allowed to say there's no room in your heart for anybody else. And your family need to understand that.  Maybe in time you will feel ready to start dating,  msybe you never will. But that's your choice,  not theirs. Don't leave your daughter with them unsupervised,  tell them it's because of their behavior. Tell them they are driving you away and they need to stop. Your romantic life is no longer up for discussion.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSOunds like a reasonable way to handle these overbearing AHs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Now all three of my sisters and my father have called me to yell at me for threatening my mother and them.

Holy shit your family have boundary issues.\n\nRather than playing victim they should be taking this as a wake-up call that they need to step off and respect your decisions.\n\nIgnoring my own advice for a moment: If you feel that you'd benefit from it at this stage I'd consider talking to someone regarding your ongoing grief response. It's difficult to tell from the context whether it's detrimental though.", "Nta- you obviously cared a lot for your wife, it\u2019s only fair for you to miss her even long after she\u2019s gone, my grandmother\u2019s husband died before I was born and she has a new boyfriend(technically husband but not official) and she still has moments, days, and even weeks when he\u2019s all she can think about. Although my grandma had gotten a new boyfriend, it still would have been okay if she decided she didn\u2019t want to \u201cmove on\u201d. In the end it\u2019s your decision and anyone who tries to make that decision for you, even after being talked to, clearly doesn\u2019t seem to care about how you feel about it.", "NTA\n\nExcuse me, \"the inevitable\"? So you're just supposed to \"get over it\" and be fine? Grief doesn't work that way. My darling's been dead for 5 years and it's every bit as awful as it was. What your family is doing is simply awful. I had friends do that, and I blocked every single one. Your grief is your own, and there's no timetable. \n\nI'm so sorry you lost your love. Please take care.", "NTA and if you never want to marry again, that\u2019s none of their fucking business. I understand they have good intentions, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. They\u2019re out of line, and I feel like what they said to your daughter is sick. I lost a partner and I don\u2019t think you get over it. And I think anyone who hasn\u2019t  \nlost a partner just won\u2019t get it. They can say they understand, but without experiencing it, I don\u2019t believe they can. If you wanted to date someone, you would. I\u2019m so sorry you are having to deal with their lack of understanding on top of your grief.", "NTA. But in situations like this, some people don\u2019t understand it unless they\u2019re been put in the same position. It\u2019s petty and borderline cruel, if any of your sisters are married and with kids, tell them that you wish them no ill will but that life happens, but how\u2019d they feel if nieces or nephews were instructed to ask for a new mommy if and when they die. If that doesn\u2019t get the point across( and they might say you wish they\u2019d die), then nothing will. Even without moving away, limit their contact to your daughter. Also, moving on doesn\u2019t always involve meeting someone new, but you might benefit from grief therapy. I hope you find joy and peace in life, yourself, and your daughter.                                         PS. There was a post about a man with a situation similar to yours who was set up on a blind date by his sister who informed the date that her brother was divorced rather than widowed.

How dare they even think of doing shit like that, it's not their place to \"set you up\" and to manipulate a little girl like that too!?!?", "NTA   Mourning is a process. Your feelings are your own and are valid. Your mom is an A for saying that to your daughter! You might want to talk to a therapist or join a grief support group. But totally up to you.

If they can't, they'll have only themselves to blame when you go low/no contact.   \n\nIt doesn't matter if \"they mean well\"or \"just want you to be happy\" because shocker - it's not up to them!
