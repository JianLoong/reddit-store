And I think anyone who hasn\u2019t  \nlost a partner just won\u2019t get it. They can say they understand, but without experiencing it, I don\u2019t believe they can.

But in situations like this, some people don\u2019t understand it unless they\u2019re been put in the same position. It\u2019s petty and borderline cruel, if any of your sisters are married and with kids, tell them that you wish them no ill will but that life happens, but how\u2019d they feel if nieces or nephews were instructed to ask for a new mommy if and when they die. If that doesn\u2019t get the point across( and they might say you wish they\u2019d die), then nothing will. Even without moving away, limit their contact to your daughter.

Agree with you though. \n\nWhat is FAFO?", "I think it\u2019s absolutely insane when people get on Reddit telling others to cut off the woman who raised him over one comment lmao was it the best comment to make? No absolutely not but this seems like a huge overreaction from OP. Grief is one thing but after 5 years and he\u2019s still buying popcorn he hates because she liked it? It seems unhealthy/obsessive and his family most likely just wants to see him happy, hence the shitty comment. I think everyone here kinda sucks", "This is a good point, honestly he probably hasn\u2019t since he\u2019s immediately had to look after a child which is difficult in general but especially unexpectedly losing your partner. Those early years are busy, now that his daughter is five he is probably finally able to get time to even have the space to heal. His family is awful, there is no one size fits all for grief or a time period when you\u2019re just supposed to be \u201cover it\u201d. People that haven\u2019t experienced loss will never understand this.", "I am a therapist. Grief covers anger in some cases. Although the family behaves poorly it might be worse for the child to be separated from family. Her loss of mom and then family may be hard for her developing years. It might be helpful to discuss the fact that a reality may be OP might not ever date or marry. That talking to the child about him is a serious boundary issue (which created his anger) and it is not to happen again or any party would be restricted from from being alone with daughter. BTW, I admire dad for taking his time to grieve and not be rushed. Our society likes to skip over grief and move. On.", "How do you know he doesn\u2019t have a happy life? Grieving doesn\u2019t stop, it just shapeshifts. You can have a happy life and simultaneously struggle with losing the love of your life. \n\nNTA, by the way. Not in the slightest. The behavior of your mom and sisters is atrocious. Bringing my kid into it would\u2019ve been the last straw for me. How dare they.", "I'm sorry for your loss.", "\"Man up\" means disregarding the emotional instability you are currently feeling and fixing the situation for you *and those you are responsible for*, you can cry about it afterwards.\n\nThe situation isn't fixed... It's still going. Emotions dont help the situation and will just cloud the judgment of those too close to the situation. \n\nNo wonder the worlds a shit show when people are too selfish and concerned about their own feelings rather than tangeable problems and the consequences of them on their own lives and those around them.", "\u201cFuck around and find out\u201d", "Fuck around and find out. Ngl I had to look it up", "F around and find out", "I think ,,fuck around and find out\"", "\"How to say that you've never faced loss, without saying you've never faced loss.\"", "Firstly- grief doesn't come with a set expiration date. Someone is setting boundaries & telling you not to meddle, listen to them.\n\nSecondly- involving a child to step-up the blackmail is an immediate no. This is toxic nonsense in the guise of \"care\".\n\nI lost my dad over a decade ago, I was a grown-ass adult when this happened. Every single time ANYBODY tried to tell me that I should tell my mom to do XYZ- I shut them down fast. I still miss so many things about my dad, and it's absolutely nobody's business to tell me or my mom how we should deal with our loss.", "Grief is different for everyone, my Mom just died yesterday. My other half is crying his eyes out, me I'm laughing at our cats and the dumber then normal stuff they have been doing. I'll cry for her when it hits she's not here anymore. But until those moments hit you wouldn't know that my mom has died if you were talking to me.", "> How do you know he doesn\u2019t have a happy life? Grieving doesn\u2019t stop, it just shapeshifts. You can have a happy life and simultaneously struggle with losing the love of your life.\n\nI don't know that.  I suggest therapy because new parents who are exposed to something like this or a child with special needs often go into survival mode and neglect their own self-care.  I wouldn't want him to go through life numb to the world simply because he didn't take care of his mental health.", ">Yes they do, but statistically, the child will at more of a disadvantage\n\n\n\nSo many statistics are out there. At the end of the day, what will you prefer- Op marries someone to please statistics and grieves all over her and the marriage and at the end of the day, new woman and child or children suffer, OR\nOP mourns for as long as it is okay to him and continues to be the best father to his daughter? \n\n\nAt the end of the day, there are human beings behind every emotion and logic. What we want is our best selves not the version of us that shows up to please others.", "And now I feel dumb for forgetting about Google. Also I had always heard \"mess around and find out\". This sounds way more fun!", "I'm an old lady. Urban dictionary has been my friend since the early 2000s. LOL", "I'm 36 but never bothered keeping up with the slang and acronyms.
