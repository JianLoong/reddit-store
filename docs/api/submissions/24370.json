But in situations like this, some people don\u2019t understand it unless they\u2019re been put in the same position. It\u2019s petty and borderline cruel, if any of your sisters are married and with kids, tell them that you wish them no ill will but that life happens, but how\u2019d they feel if nieces or nephews were instructed to ask for a new mommy if and when they die. If that doesn\u2019t get the point across( and they might say you wish they\u2019d die), then nothing will. Even without moving away, limit their contact to your daughter.

When you loose a close loved one you get a box with a button on the wall, that's the pain button. Inside that box is a ball bouncing around. When the ball hits the button, you feel the pain. You don't control the ball or the button, but things that happen, or you see or do, or things that people say can cause the ball to bounce off the pain button. Over time, the size of the button will shrink and it will be less likely that the ball hits it, but you will always have it. \n\nI'm assuming that this isn't the firs time they've hinted, implied or prodded. If someone in your life doesn't understand or care that their actions are causing you pain, then they are not thinking about you, they are thinking about them and what they want.
