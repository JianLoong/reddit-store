But in situations like this, some people don\u2019t understand it unless they\u2019re been put in the same position. It\u2019s petty and borderline cruel, if any of your sisters are married and with kids, tell them that you wish them no ill will but that life happens, but how\u2019d they feel if nieces or nephews were instructed to ask for a new mommy if and when they die. If that doesn\u2019t get the point across( and they might say you wish they\u2019d die), then nothing will. Even without moving away, limit their contact to your daughter.

It may have been a hard band-aid to rip off, and surely caused some pain initially, but I think it set in place some healthy boundaries. \n\nAlso, I'm so sorry for your loss, and your daughter's loss. I'm a father of 3 myself, and can't even begin to imagine what it's been like for you, but I'm proud of you nonetheless.

Move on when you are ready, if you ever want to.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA", "NTA - weaponising your daughter is not acceptable. If that continues, it's time to go nuclear. The only thing I *might* recommend is counseling, but again, it's something to do only if you feel you need it. Or if you think what your family has done has negatively impacted your daughter.", "NTA, take your time.", "NTA.\n\nI would like to ask though, outside of this situation, how is the relationship between your daughter and your family? She's already lost her mother but if (aside from crazy present requests) she has a good relationship with them, it would be incredibly hard for her to have lost her mother, and then change her home and lose the rest of her family except for you.\n\nI absolutely don't condone how your family are treating you and you do need to impress upon them how inappropriate their comments are (though they might now have gotten that idea), but don't forget the impact on your daughter too.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA but you should stop talking and start planning and calculating what is realistic. You don\u2019t have to use your plan, but you really should have one for inevitable blind dates in your future. \u201cOh let\u2019s have a family dinner, I invited some friends who happen to be all single ladies\u201d", "NTA  \nYou daughter should not have been used as a tool against you.  \nYou are dealing with your grief how you feel you need to, some people move on quickly and others take a longer time, maybe never.  \nHowever, may I offer an opinion to balance calling your whole family assholes?  \nThey also had to deal with the grief of your wife dieing, and now they are grieving for you - whom they desperately want to 'help'. You may well want to deal with your own grief in your own way - which is your right of course. But while you do that, just remember that they are probably also hurting, for you. And for people suggesting cutting them off - that is just being spiteful, how would your daughter feel?  \n\n\nI would suggest you go to grief counselling if you haven't already been.   \nYour daughter will eventually pick up on the fact that you still deeply grieving, and kids can make 2 + 2 = 5 in an instant. I know I did when I was younger.", "Your mom should literally be ashamed of herself so saying that foul ass shit to a child!!!! NTA Why not just let you live your life ffs?!??", "NTA.

They're not offering 'help'. They're offering Hlep. It kinda looks like help but it's wrong.\nYou don't have to date if you don't want to. You can date if you want to. However, it all hinges on YOU and what YOU want. They don't get to dictate any of it, and they most certainly do not get to attempt to manipulate a little girl to get their way.\n\nWhat they did to your daughter is despicable. They deserved being yelled at. They need to wind their necks in and mind their own business.", "NTA. It's extremely inappropriate for them to say those things to a five-year old. \n\nI'm a widow. My husband passed away two years ago. I have not once felt like being in another relationship and I am still convinced that he was my last. I'm 39 years old. It llisn't inevitable that I will be with someone again either. The only opinion about that which matters is my own. If other people tried to involve themselves in that aspect of my life, I would absolutely cut them out of my life if they disrespected my boundaries and didn't stop. I don't even have a kid, so I'm sure that would make it even more difficult.\n\nThey can't tell you how to grieve or to move on, *especially* if the loss of a spouse isn't something they've personally experienced. People just don't know until they go through it. There are so many secondary losses and it's difficult to convey just how hard it is. I'm so very sorry for your loss and that you do understand this experience. \n\nIf or when you are interested in another relationship again, it would be on your own terms and not because you've been forced into it.

Take as much time as you\u2019re comfortable with finding, or not finding, someone else. If you\u2019re otherwise happy and mentally healthy but just not ready or willing to move on, don\u2019t.

But you DO want to process it - your grief should mature. \n\nEvery reminder of them shouldn\u2019t forever  be a skewer in your heart reminding you of what\u2019s missing and what\u2019s lost. It\u2019s something that will always be with you but I think you should consider whether you might need some support or counselling to help you cope with it in a way that their memory brings you joy and you can laugh at the silliness and let the smell of the kettle corn fill you with laughter and longing and a sadness that\u2019s not consuming. \n\nI may be misreading this, please excuse me if I am, but I saw myself in your comment and wanted to pause to check in. Are you remembering her the way she\u2019d want you to, in a way that\u2019s helpful for you and your daughter, and a sweet reminder of her touch on your life? For me it\u2019s important to remember that every time I start to feel overwhelmed or lost or dwell too long.", "NTA, to me, this story just goes to show how little your parents mean to each other and how little your sisters' significant others mean to them.

Your family doesn\u2019t get to decide if and when you move on and their behaviour is disgusting, but your mother is the worst for trying to emotionally manipulate your daughter, it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t respect you.\n\nJust a suggestion, maybe seek out a support group for yourself may help with the grief, I wish you the best", "NTA. Your loss and your suffering with it doesn't happen to a timeline. Your priorities are your own emotions and your family unit with your daughter.

Does she even understand 'mommy', despite never having experienced   it? Nta BTW. How freaking sick to use your kid that way", "Absolutely not.\n\nYou are under no requirement to \"move on\". I can understand your family wishing you a new love but to say that to your daughter is horrifying. Establish the boundary now that this kind of chat to your daughter is unacceptable.

I'm not saying you should \"get over it\" or anything else.  But after 5 years, you shouldn't be in daily pain.\n\nFinding yourself not only grieving the loss of your wife, but becoming a single parent to a newborn, is a hell of a hit.
