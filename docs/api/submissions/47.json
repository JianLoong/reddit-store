Shane already had Riley when he and my sister met but Riley had no mom in his life so my sister has taken over that role and Riley calls her mom. Back when my sister and Shane first got married Sloane and Cian had told me how their mom called Riley her son, how she and Shane called him their brother, but how they didn't think of him as their brother. They said sometimes Shane would be called their dad too and they didn't feel that way either. They asked me not to tell their mom because she wouldn't like that and would try to change how they felt. I told them they could talk to me if they needed to and I hoped things could be okay. They said they weren't unhappy. But they didn't feel the way their mom wanted them to. Over the years they have talked to me about not feeling a sibling bond like they do with each other toward Riley and then Bria when she was born. They also don't consider Shane their parent and even though they call him their stepdad, they do think of him different than Robbie and my sister.\n\nThe truth came out a few weeks ago because Sloane made a scrapbook as suggested by her therapist (both her and Cian have gone to one on and off since their dad died) and my sister went through it and saw that she hadn't included Riley, Bria or Shane in it, but had included her, Robbie, Cian and their extended family.

If you\u2019d tried to tell her before now, she\u2019d probably have dismissed you or tried to make it your fault, instead of focusing on what she needs to do to make it better.

If she can\u2019t see that, then maybe *all* of you need to talk out why that is in therapy.", "NTA - you let the kids trust you and that is incredibly important about a subject like that.

Kids sometimes need a sounding board just like adults do. But at the same time, the parents need to trust that you will tell them if safety is a concern. It doesn\u2019t sound like you or your sister ever discussed something like this. \n\nMy mom has a great relationship with her best friend\u2019s kids. They trust that they can confide in her, and the agreement with her, the kids, and her best friend is that:\n1. She will not share information with their mom unless she is concerned for their safety, if that is the case she will tell the kids she can\u2019t keep it from their parents (and often helps them figure out how tell their mom on their own)\n2. If their mom asks her a question she will not lie to her and she\u2019ll answer the question. (This comes into play when their mom suspects something is up, she\u2019s not asking questions out of nowhere.)\n\nMy mom sticks to that agreement religiously, her best friend trusts that she will tell her if something is really wrong, and the kids trust that my mom will be upfront with them if she needs to involve their mom. \n\nOP, something like this could work for you, your sister, and your nieces and nephews. I would talk to her about it and see how she feels.", "NTA. You could of course not break their trust. You could perhaps have used that trust to encourage them to speak to their mom, but overall I guarantee you did a whole lot more for those kids by providing a safe outlet for their feelings than by becoming one more adult they couldn't quite rely on.", "NTA. \n\nYour BIL died when your niece and nephew were 7 and 8-years-old. A year after their dad died your sister met someone else and brought a toddler into their lives. A year later she added a baby to the mix. She must have gotten pregnant almost immediately after bringing a new man and his child into their lives. And then she expected them to be okay with calling their stepfather dad? It baffles me that she thought children that young wouldn't be upset about those changes. I can understand how, from a child's perspective, it appears she replaced their dad almost immediately and then replaced them as well. I think your sister feels guilty for not seeing how her children felt and is looking for someone to blame.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why she said she would have \"focused more on time between the older kids and younger kids\" if only she had known. Your niece and nephew were only 9 and 10 when their sister was born. What type of activities were they doing that included the younger children but not the older ones? Or did they include all the children and she's saying she would have done more? \n\nThis is an unfortunate situation, but I think you did the right thing. I think breaking a child's trust when it's not something that involves their immediate safety can be pretty damaging. And for what? Your sister is assuming she didn't arrange enough activities that involved all of her children, but it's more likely that she moved on faster than they were ready for. She can't change that. I think it would help your sister to get some counseling with her 2 older children. They all need to learn to communicate and she needs to be able to hear them.", "NTA - You were asked not to tell. It\u2019s not on you to inform their mother how they were feeling (unless they were thinking of self-harm). She should have been the one to notice that something was up.", "NTA, I\u2019m surprised your sister didn\u2019t realize it for herself", "NTA imo as long as it's not life-threatening then you did the right thing. if for so many years she didn't notice her picture-perfect family wasn't that perfect then she is a horrible mother. and why did she go through the scrapbook, was she allowed to do so or was that a violation of privacy? because if so, that would explain so much.", "This is a tough one, I\u2019m going with NAH. Generally, things their parent needs to know should be told to the parent, regardless of how the kids feel. However, here, 1) the kids came in confidence, with a need to talk to someone who knew them and they trusted. They needed that, and their trust would\u2019ve been shattered had you spoken to your sister about what they felt. 2) from what you\u2019ve said, I doubt your sister would have dealt with it appropriately. She clearly has her own agenda, which is different from the kids. The only thing I\u2019d add is that you could\u2019ve spoken to your sister about *her* attitude towards this \u2018happy family\u2019 and suggested that she talk to her kids and follow their lead, rather than try to push her own view on them. That would not betray their trust, but might encourage communication. That said, I understand your sister\u2019s point of view, and while I think she\u2019s misguided, I understand her wanting to know what\u2019s happening with her kids.", "NTA and the kids were right. When she found out you knew, she wanted you to have told her so she could try to force the relationship.", "NTA \n\nYour sister needs to chill. You are an amazing uncle! Those kids felt they could come and talk to you and you provided them with a safe outlet. \n\nI'm sure you would tell your sister if they said they were suicidal or needed intervention. You are not obligated to betray their confidence, especially when it's how they feel. She would just use that information against them and now they wouldn't trust you any longer.\n\n Sister needs a reality check, you are a godsend to her if she would just open her eyes. No one can get info out of teenagers, well maybe someone can but it's really hard. You've done just that, kids tell you how they really feel and you're there for them, keep that shit up! If they came to you with something she needed to know, I'm sure you would tell her and she needs to see this is the right move in the bigger picture! \n\nShe's just hurt her efforts in making the Brady Bunch aren't working according to plan but hey... that's life we adapt and move on cause nothing works according to plan. \n\nFocus on healthy and happy, you can't force love.", "I'm going with ESH, exept the kids.\n\nYou should have told your sister.

Their secret was not hurting anyone. As a widow myself I can't imagine ever expecting or wanting my kids to think of a (hypothetical, future) husband as their father.

Don't doubt that. \n\nI come from a similar situation to your sister and I think that she is completely in the wrong here. I am a mother to 3 children who's father is deceased and am in a long term relationship that involves moving in together in the near future. \n\nEarly in the relationship I had discussions with my partner on his opinions/expectations regarding his relationships and role in my children's lives. I already knew what I thought will be acceptable but wanted to hear from him. What he hoped for was that they would want him to be their friend. If they chose for him to be their confidant, step dad or father figure, he would be over the moon.  He has kept true to that. He has let them each lead their relationship with him. Which this year led to them deciding to celebrate him for father's day. He was overjoyed that they thought of him. \n\nI also have had discussions with my children regarding my partner. And yes it is discussions because with any sort of relationships there should be ongoing discussions, not one and done. I told them that no one is trying to replace their dad because no one is replaceable. That it is okay to love another person as a father figure like they do with their uncles and grandfathers. They also look at their aunts and grandmothers as mother figures as well. That it is up to them how they view my partner and that everyone is to respect each other.\n\nThe one thing that I made damn sure of was that they knew that there is no right or wrong way to feel. That every feeling is valid and that they can come to me with anything. I have also made sure that if, for whatever reason, they don't want to talk to me about something that they have other adults they can talk to instead (aunts, uncles, grandparents, therapists basically whoever they feel comfortable talking to). \n\nDo I want to know what they talk about? Yes. Do I need to know? Absolutely not. If it is serious or concerns their safety the adult will let me know or help my child to talk to me about it. \n\nI have trust in myself that I've surrounded my kids with a village that will fight for my children's best interests. That is what you are doing NTA", "NTA", "It seems like they have an excellent Uncle, OP", "NAH Because I understand where you are coming from, in wanting to give the kids a safe space to air their true feelings, and not wanting to betray those confidences.\n\nBUT if I were your sister, I would be angry too.  You will get a lot of NTAs here from people used to responding to posts about blended families forcing kids to call new parents mom and dad, being told to sacrifice for their new siblings etc.  But that is not what you are describing.  Your niblings don't love when people refer to their stepdad as their dad, but it is also not kind to \"other\" children who haven't requested it.  Saying \"These are my kids, x and y, and these are my *step*\\-kids.\"  No one is making your niblings call him dad.  They are just including niblings in the whole family.\n\nThe fact that your niblings confessed that they feel the same detachment toward their little sister is concerning.  That child IS their blood, and they have been there since day one with her. But they continue to view her as an outsider to their own childhood family, which they have now etched into stone in their minds.  This sounds more like an attachment disorder than a kid failing to mesh with a step-parent.\n\nMeanwhile, you KNEW they were not letting on to their true feelings to your sister, and you KNEW she had no idea.  They needed help.  You felt like lending them an ear and safe space was providing them that ear.  But realistically - it was not.  They needed therapy. Therapy that addressed the deep issues that they were hiding from their mom and their therapist.  And I do think you should have caught on after a few years of this talk that they needed more than what you were providing.  Your sister sounds like a loving mom, who would not immediately rush to tattle on you to the kids.  It seems like you could have simply said \"Sis, the kids have been confiding in me recently, and they seem to be struggling a lot with their relationships in the growing family.

You are uncle to Sloane and Cian.  Good for you for keeping their confidence and keeping your promise not to tell.

To me it likely would have made things worse. Their household isn't bad at all. It's not what my sister thought she had and wanted. But there is no anger or resentment and I feel like that would be far worse.", "Honestly i don't know that I'd constitute this as need to know. If the mom needed to know either her kids would've told HER themselves, or she would've asked. If a younger family member shares a secret with me it's only \"need to know\" if they're in danger, going to be in danger, or it's incredibly troubling. Lots of children feel this way when a parent remarries so I wouldn't say it's especially troubling one way or the other yknow?", "That was suggested to her a few times by a few of us. She was very, very eager at the time and our family wanted her to think of the kids. Not that they were unhappy, they aren't unhappy about any of it they just don't feel the same joy as my sister. But she was never able to stop and think the kids might not have all the feelings she wanted them to have.", "How does the uncle suck. He was a safe space for his niblings to confide in.

That\u2019s more than reasonable for OP to ask of his sister, this type of conversation should never be left to assumptions. \n\nFurther, parents should *always* be aware of who their kids are close with. Being a confidante is closer than just being uncle/niece/nephew. Mom being aware doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s privy to what the conversations are, it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s entitled to dictate what the relationship is or should be.

Is this situation that extreme? Absolutely not, and I\u2019m so glad for that. But it does happen to other kids.
