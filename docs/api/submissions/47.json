My parents were excited, because frankly I considered dropping out and absolutely hated it. I not only passed but scraped into a 2:1! My mum promised to grab some Chinese to celebrate because it's my favourite. That never happened and I guess she forgot, no big deal, her cooking is great too. Instead, since I can now afford to, I offer to take our fam of 4 to a restaurant I wanted to show them in the next town over.\n\nDad can't make it the first weekend, so can we do it next week? Or another restaurant closer to home? Fine, next week, but I'd really like to go to that specific place. The restaurants in our town suck. That's not being mean - *I wanna go someplace nicer to celebrate than the Thai we've been going to for the last decade.*\n\n\"*Oh, can we go to the Mediterranean instead? Can we bring your cousin?*\" Sure, I haven't seen her in a while, but I'm set on where I'd like to go. I'm paying for the whole thing.\n\nWhich brings me to this morning, \"*Can your brother's friends' family join? We need to thank them for helping with the car*.\" Firmly no, at this point I'm getting pissed. I decline and say this is a family event, and I'd rather not. I barely know these people, I met them twice.\n\nI come down an hour later to \"Does it have to be that one?*Can we find a restaurant in town? Or we can go tomorrow or the day after? We don't feel like taking the bus.\"*\n\nAt that point I just said no, we're not going. You're welcome to go out if you like, but I'm done. I made it a consistent point over the last two weeks that I'd really like to go to this specific place. Maybe that is petty, but I was excited to share something I like with my family.\n\nPS. Why I'm so annoyed by this\n\n1. When I was going to drop out in 2nd year because I hated uni (I never wanted to go, generational pressure won) my mum made a deal that if I graduate, she'll give me \u00a33k. Obviously, being a broke 20ish, i said fine. I finished uni. \"Oh, I'll give it to you if you get a good grade.\" Fine, i got a pretty decent grade. \"oh, I'll give it to you when the degree arrives.\" We got the degree framed. \"Oh i didn't think you'd actually graduate so i never started saving.\"\n2. the first place she wanted to switch to was a fancy roast meat joint. I'm a vegetarian.\n3. Train tickets to that city are \u00a33. This is really not an issue. We'd pay the same for parking if we drove out.\n\nSo am I too angry about this? My mother texted me to say 'we'll go, calm down, i was just asking.\" but I honestly don't feel like it anymore. I feel disrespected. I wanted to share some specific food that I really loved and I feel like that effort was throw in the trash since I started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT : I took my mum and my brother after my mum came to apologise. We have a rough relationship but I want to believe she's trying. Dad didn't feel like joining because he was still 'too angry about it'. They had a good time and really enjoyed the place, I introduced them to some cool Japanese teas and we ended up buying a few to take home. \n\nWe still have a long way to go and I feel my mother struggles to see me as a grown adult person.  Her apologises are yet to feel sincere and not like 'keeping the peace' but I want to believe she's trying in her own way.", "created_utc": 1673706980, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bpw8r/aita_for_saying_i_no_longer_care_and_want_to_take/", "score": 416, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have worked hard and wanted to do something nice to celebrate. Your family is selfish. I'm sorry they treated you that way.", "Aww Op NTA. I'm sorry your mom is clueless to her own narcissism. She promises things without having any intention of keeping her word, she keeps pushing for her way even after you set a boundary (the restaurant you picked out) and then also wants to take advantage of your generosity (most likely to show off and make herself look better)", "NTA.

I'm proud of you.", "I'm sorry your mother is so flaky.\n\nNTA \n\nCongratulations from a random internet stranger on your degree and getting through it.  \n\nEnjoy your job and treat yourself to something nice.", "NTA \n\nI hope you can invite some nice friends, fellow graduates or work colleagues to a fun dinner and celebrate your hard work! \n\nSetting boundaries and showing people how to respect you and treat you is important. (Read that again). Your family can sit this one out. \n\nCongrats on graduating and your job Op! \ud83c\udf89You should be proud of your hard work and in case your family didn\u2019t say it: We are all super happy for you and proud of you!", "NTA\n\nThe way I look at this is you worked incredibly hard to do something you didnt want to do. Instead of being even remotely supportive your family has belittled your accomplishment thru your mother's actions and the constant struggle over doing a single simple thing you would really appreciate. Your parents honestly both really suck. They might be excited but they sure as shit arent supportive in this situation.", "Your family is terrible. Hugs from a mom who thinks you deserve a fancy dinner and a party. NTA.", "NTA. But. Don\u2019t waste energy on being angry. It only hurts you. Let it go. Take a couple good friends there.", "NTA.  You're feeling disrespected because you were being disrespected. It's okay to ask once, but not accepting the answer and continuing to ask is being insistent.\n\nIt also seems like your family is trying to take advantage of you by getting you to pay off their debt and to invite others that you barely know. This is a celebration of your huge accomplishment. It doesn't need to be combined with something else to make it worth the effort of going out. \n\nSorry your family can't be happy for you and celebrate the way you'd like (the person of honor always gets to choose where to go/ what to do). \n\nCongratulations on your degree!", "NTA.  Don\u2019t go. This time, F them. Do something nice for yourself. They would spend your celebratory dinner not celebrating you and prolly ask why you couldn\u2019t just do xyz for them.  Bring them some takeout from the restaurant if you still feel a little guilty. If they don\u2019t want to eat it, it\u2019s yummy leftovers for you!", "NTA one of the toxic parent's tricks is not only berating and guilt trips about being a bad son/daughter, ungrateful, selfish etc, is the false promises. If you just do this for me, we will reward you with such and such, but it never happens. I remember one of my dad's promises was if you agree not to have a birthday party, I will take you to the safari park. So no birthday party and no trip to the safari park either. Then the following year it was oh, you don't have birthday parties now. Bait and switch is very common too. Celebrate with your friends and move past your parents. Don't buy any birthday or Christmas presents, just a card with an amount off the 3 grand she owes you.", "NTA!", "NTA.

If anyone would like to join me, let me know by 7pm.\"\n\nGive people choices and they take the piss. It's the equivalent of \"here's dinner, take it or leave it \"", "NTA. It honestly sounds like they're actually trying to make it all about them, but still get you to pay for it.", "NTA.\n\nThis is like the time when I had a milestone birthday and my sister came down for my birthday dinner.  We had booked at a place in town that I really liked, but as I had viral fever and was still getting over it (achy etc), I asked if they wouldn\u2019t mind switching it to somewhere closer. First thing my mother says is - on, now your sister won\u2019t get to go to a nice meal. I didn\u2019t say anything but just tried to book a nice place closer to home. Turns out, they were shit down for a private event.  My mom again lamented that my sister was missing out on the bestest time.  At that point, all I wanted to do was have a pizza delivered and eat it by myself in my bedroom. \n\nYou feel disrespected because you are being disrespected. And this, unfortunately, seems to be part of a pattern where your accomplishments are being minimised. \n\nI am glad you ended up having a great time with your mother or brother.  But consider also celebrating with your mates. And congratulations on graduating (with a 2:1 no less!) and getting a great job.
