My uncle (the only person in my family to pass besides my grandpa) had his ashes distributed among family members so to my sister this makes sense and I get why she would want to have some of posies. I\u2019m upset at them for asking but I feel really guilty for saying no and I want to know if I should just give them some of her ashes and let it go or if I\u2019m in the clear here.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

People sometimes wear memorial jewelry, or have little urns. It's a pretty old practice too.\n\nI can understand how you feel, having just lost a few dear animals this year. Like it or not, your dad and sister are also grieving Posie. She must have been a very special girl. \n\nIf you end up deciding to keep her all in one parcel, that's up to you at the end of the day, and I would communicate compassionately that you want her to rest in peace, not in pieces. (Maybe don't use that phrase, but that's the idea. You want her remains kept together.) I am deeply sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA, but you're being kind of TA in the comments.", "It sounds like you're grieving and maybe don't have the best family support. \n\nObjectively, it is okay for your other family members to ask for some ashes. It is common for both pet and human ashes be separated among their living loved ones. While I can see how this might seem sacrilegious to you, I think it is a sweet way to carry our loved ones with us. \n\nIt is okay that they asked, and it's okay that you're upset. You are still grieving right now and I would maybe let them know you're open to talking about it more when you've had some more time to process everything.

(I am not taking criticism on this).\n\nAn animal that *sort of looks like* her? Is this a stuffed **_dog_** or not?\n\nHow was the relationship between your sister and father and the dog? They sure seem fond of her. Do you feel like they're not entitled to grieve in the same way you are?", "I can't call you an asshole because I understand this. I have buried my dogs in the back yard and I hate the thought of it raining on them, cold nights, etc. But these things are in my head, just like not wanting to \"separate\" Posie is in yours. Posie's body no longer exists. \n\nYour dad and sister are grieving her too, and maybe Posie would have liked to become part of that back yard by having a bit of her ashes spread there in the home where she lived and was loved. \n\nYou can still make your stuffed animal.", "NTA because from your post it seems you do not have a good relationship with you father. You said he took you to your grandparents home to live, it seems that you were in some sort of toxic environment and your doggo was the one thing you had.", "I understand how you feel. I experienced a similar situation about 2 weeks ago. Everyone has a right to grieve differently. You were obviously closest to Posie and she would\u2019ve been with you still if she was alive. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you wanting to keep it that way. If you feel you want this stuffed animal then you do that and do right by her in preserving her memory in a special way. You will cherish that and remember it longer than your sister will being upset she didn\u2019t get a piece of it. \n\nHonestly your sisters behavior makes me cringe. How entitled and insensitive. I get she\u2019s grieving too but she\u2019s doing it selfishly by repeatedly asking you when you\u2019re obviously getting increasingly bothered by it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. I hope you do what\u2019s best for you.\n\nOh and ABSOLUTELY NTA\n\nAlso I thought I should add.. I\u2019d be careful about where you keep this stuffed animal. I hope your family isn\u2019t the type to just take things without your knowledge or consent. Just be careful", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss but YTA here.
