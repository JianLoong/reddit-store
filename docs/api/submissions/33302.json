{"id": 33302, "submission_id": "18lgbmy", "title": "AITA for writing my son out of my will", "selftext": "My wife and I (48M) have a son, John (26M) who recently told us that he is asking his girlfriend, Cece to marry him. We\u2019ve met Cece a few times before and she seems like a nice girl, but we have concerns about Cece\u2019s family.\n\nMy wife and I own a few rental properties and John stay in one of the properties rent free as he is still in grad school, and free housing is something my wife and I\u2019ve always agreed to provided for all our kids, especially while they are in school so that they don\u2019t have to worry about rent in a high cost of living area. The concern with Cece\u2019s family comes from having met the family a couple times before; they seems inappropriately interested in my wife and I\u2019s finances, and Cece\u2019s mother (from what I\u2019ve heard from my other kids and a little from John), is close to retirement, has no savings or plans set up for retirement. Her mother has multiple times attempted to move in and live rent free in one of my properties because according to her, it is \u201cher future son in law\u2019s house\u201d. My take is that Cece\u2019s mother sees John, who is about to graduate from med school, as their retirement security.\n\nJohn\u2019s my oldest and I\u2019ve signed a will where he gets a large amount of cash plus the property that Cece\u2019s mother was trying to move into. I\u2019m not sure if the mother knows that and that\u2019s why she was trying to move in, but John does know about what he is inheriting. My biggest fear is that somehow that family will end up with a piece of the house for whatever reason once I pass, John has a pure heart and always sees the good in people, and I think his future mother-in-law will take advantage of that. When John told me he is getting married to Cece, I requested he signs a prenup to protect his inheritance (and also prenups are advisable in general), but he was vehemently against it. I told him that he will be written out of the will and the house will go to our other kids if he marries her without a prenup, but seems like he is not budging, so i've gone ahead and started plans to leave the house to my other kid.  I think I have good reasons to not trust Cece\u2019s family and their intentions with my son. I\u2019m not going to tell a grown man who he can and can\u2019t marry but I want to protect what I am leaving for my children. My son has stopped talking to me and I'm not sure if I was that unreasonable.\n\nUpdate: A few things to add because my concerns about Cece's family are not coming out of no where. We are mostly concerned about the house, my son will still be receiving the huge chunk of cash on the will, he will be getting something, just not the house, sorry should have made that more clearer. When my wife and I met Cece's mother, she's made multiple comments about how her future son in law has her retirement taken care of, and she has asked us multiple time if she could move  into the house to the point where it was getting inappropriate.", "created_utc": 1702925611, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lgbmy/aita_for_writing_my_son_out_of_my_will/", "score": 1605, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I realize 20-something year old me did and nearly did quite a few very stupid things with the best of intentions, so I recognize the need to protect him\u2026 is there an option to place these properties in a trust so as to protect him, but also to not actually write him out of the will? Consult an attorney on the options for maximum protection and flexibility, of course, but it feels like it shouldn\u2019t have to be all or nothing. \n\nNAH - it\u2019s your property.", "another option would be to put the money (or portion of it) and house into a trust that he cannot access until he is 45 or some age you deem appropriate.", "NTA\n\nYou could do a trust and have a trustee continue to exercise control after your death or even in your will have a prenup clause (my father did that) where anyone who wants to inherit must have a prenup", "NTA\n\nSome of our family friends had a daughter-in-law who was greedier than you can imagine. They immediately locked all of their assets up in an iron-clad trust. Their daughter and son-in-law didn't care at all, nor did their son, but their daughter-in-law hit the roof. The trust specifically kept all assets and money out of the hands of both people their children married. The grandchildren were cared for, and their children received small annual payouts.\n\nThis is the way. Whether it's property or money, there are amazing trusts that keep the inheritance intact and prevent grasping in-laws from ever getting their hands on it. Find a good estate lawyer, and you'll be protecting everything against all current and future greedy people.", "NTA. Leave your son in your will but place all of his inheritance in a trust.", "Cece's mother is definitely a golddigger, but is Cece? A trust is one idea, another is the trial balloon of letting Cece's mom find out you have massive debts and there will be no inheritance.", "NTA.  Trust your gut - why should you have outsiders come in and take what you worked for.  Maybe you want to leave your son a bit of cash but nothing major that the inlaws could benefit from.  \n\nIt would be interesting to see how things would turn out if the GF's family knew that your son was getting nothing and would not be funding their retirement etc.", "NTA, your son is young and cannot see the red flags.  It is your property and you can do what you want with it.  Better get an estate attorney to help you with options.", "Look into a family trust. Ensures more equitable distribution. Writing a kid out is your will is likely to be challenged and they may get more. Other option is to leave him a small amount, to show that you've thought about it. And add a letter explaining your decision to go alongside the will.", "Put everything into a trust to go from John to his children.  Spouse doesn\u2019t have access.", "You are NTA for being concerned about this - but you are going about it all wrong.  You need to do some proper estate planning with a good lawyer to ensure your son isn't taken advantage of by what seems to be a very opportunistic set of in-laws, but without punishing him in the process.  As it is, you are hurting him by the way you are going about this.  You can place the property in trust and let him live in it rent free on the condition that the only inhabitants are him, his wife and kids.  Or something similar.", "NAH, but doing this will likely affect your relationship with your son for the rest of your life.\n\nIsn\u2019t there a compromise? You should speak to an attorney about a trust and stipulations with that trust around MIL.", "NTA - it should all be in a revocable trust w him as the sole trustee- you can even put covenants on the properties if you want.", "NTA- your son is being extremely naive. Cece may be a lovely person but her family, not so much. When your son is in financial crisis from her family sponging off him, he's going to wish he listened to you.", "So, to start I think NTA. I think it's really gross of people to start trying to use or parse parts of a future inheritance now. While your son has good intentions and is pure of heart - him + enabling future wife and MIL to consider this property his now is awful and gross. I find being this grubby over inheritance gross because 1) it's not theirs YET 2) it's like saying \"I'm so excited for you to pass and I get your things!\" That may not be what is being said, but it's the vibe. You also have no idea where life will take you between now and the inevitable. You might need to use those properties to get cash for a number of things that can take place with old age. So these are yours to do what you wish till then. Leaving an inheritance is amazing and so nice, but certainly not a requirement. Beyond that, your son's wife and MIL shouldn't be considered in that - just your kids. It its not your 'job' to take care of a wholly different family only connected via marriage. \n\n  \nIn terms of what to do... I might just sit your son down and say all of this - or your version of it. That it pains you to see his wife and MIL essentially excited for your passing due to what they think he'll get and therefore that they will get. I would remind him that these are your things (house/money) until you pass and who knows what will come in life between now and passing. Beyond that, you have a wife and other kids to be worried about taking care of when that time comes and these people need to not count their chickens before... well they hatch or in this case pass.", "I would like to make a suggestion that you put all your properties and money into trusts and have that money slowly released to your children. As for the houses, I would allow them to live in them and the \"rent\" the houses at 50% market rate and put that money into the trust also to be filled out back to them eventually. \n\nMake this a business not family. If the house sits empty for more then a couple years it's to be put on the market and sold.", "Sounds like a BIG part of the problem here is that your son has gone around telling people about his inheritance.\n\nNTA", "NTA this is your money and no one can claim it not even your kids. What I am hearing you say is that you don\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4t trust him to handle that pressure of those golddiggers and they will take him for everything he\u00b4\u00b4 s got. In that case then your other children might as well get his part.", "Nta, he doesn\u2019t want a prenup which is perfectly fine with his money. He should understand he is not entitled to what you have and while his financial are not your concern it should be the same for your finances", "NTA - You should trust your gut. However I believe you need to consult an Estate attorney with your concerns and have them help you handle your finances and property appropriately so as to protect ALL your children. \n\nYour son sounds like a good man just needs someone to look out for his best interests. Perhaps set up all your kids with a wealth manager on top of getting the estate attorney. Wise people have other smart people they consult in areas they are experts in. \n\nThis MIL sounds like a piece of work.", "NTA.\n\nYou gave him sound financial advice - with a bit of an ultimatum so he\u2019s aware of the consequences of his actions and as you said \u201che\u2019s not budging\u201d. And that\u2019s ok. You made your decision, he made his. It\u2019s all good.", "Could there be a trust of some sort made?\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to be wary of people who are scoping out what you have, but it will only alienate your son.\n\nNTA - I think you\u2019re trying to protect him, but you\u2019re right, he\u2019s an adult. He has to make decisions for himself. Unfortunately love for his gf may make him blind to them/willing to accept these caveats in relationship.\n\nI would take an empathetic view and ask him why he loves and trusts her, not from a space of control, but a space of understanding. Express your concerns, **maybe with a family counselor (just for 3rd party impartial communication/mediation). I don\u2019t see people who want to be apart, but are having issues in effectively communicating with one another.", "NTA You are allowed to do whatever you want with your funds. But I wouldn\u2019t punish your son for his choice of wife. What he does with his money after your death is his business - and who knows what your other kids will do with it! Personally, I would divide everything as evenly as possible - unless there was a significant need for why someone should have MORE than someone else (ex. a medical issue). You don\u2019t want Will drama to make your passing even harder on your kids. Keep it simple and put their relationship first. \n\nPlus - you want John and future grandkids around, right? Keep the drama as minimal as possible. My husband was told a similar thing from his father before we got married and neither of us have ever fully forgiven him. \n\nSource: I\u2019ve seen two families fall apart after Wills gave things out unequally. People get MEAN when it comes to $$ and I would personally want to spare my kids the likelihood of that experience.", "Set up a trust for all- treat all of your children equally or they will resent each other.", "NTA. It is always a good idea to have a prenup even if each party doesn\u2019t have much to offer at that moment that doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t in the future.\nEdit: my family has something similar happening but it\u2019s  my brother\u2019s gf who is constantly talking about \u201cwhen she owns the businesses\u201d and how \u201cwhen she owns the house\u201d. She\u2019s not even close to being engaged to my brother and she\u2019s already looking forward to my father\u2019s death so that she can get her grubby paws on our investments.", "NTA", "NTA. No prenup \u2192 no inheritance. His choice.", "Nta", "She\u2019s gonna be real disappointed if she sees the paychecks he will be getting in residency", "NTA", "NTA - put it into a special trust fund", "If you have to ask strangers, it's obvious you have reservations about changing the will regarding your son. That being said, if you don't want to create lasting problems between you and John and you want to contribute a portion of your holdings that will not benefit your daughter-in-laws family, arrange a LEGAL TRUST that is for his future children. His MD degree should provide adequate income for his wife, him and their immediate family. \nYou cannot control how he handles his future income regardless of your feelings/thoughts about the in-laws.", "I HATE when people do this. No, you are not an AH, but you are badly ill-informed.\n\nThe remedy for this is an irrevocable trust for the benefit of John plus any children he may bear.\n\nPlease see an attorney before you compromise your son.", "NTA - seems fair. Hopefully if anything happens the siblings who control the house make sure John could stay there if he ever needed for whatever reason but you're not responsible for John's in-laws. If they know the house will be his, they will know when it's not his and won't feel like that house is an option for them.", "Is it an American thing to be so concerned about property that you're willing to destroy your relationships with your children? The replies seem to suggest you are definitely not alone. By all means look into a trust, but the most important thing should be to keep the love and respect of your kids, not what happens to \"one of your houses\" after you've snuffed it.", "YTA if you truly plan on writing him out of your will.  He\u2019s going to interpret your actions as trying to use his inheritance to control him.  This is unlikely to have the effect you desire which I assume is to protect him from some opportunistic in-laws.\n\nI think you need to remind all parties involved that you are not planning on dying any time soon but you do you plan to enjoy the fruits of your labour.  Your investment and real estate portfolio could look entirely different by the time your children inherit. \n\nYour son may himself be close to retirement age by the time you pass. They shouldn\u2019t be making any financial plans based on an expected windfall.  He might not even be married anymore at that point! \n\nDo see an experienced estate lawyer to understand what options you have to protect the assets (as others mentioned - a trust might be a good idea).", "So, you\u2019re choosing a house over your son? Interesting choice. \n\nYou realize you\u2019ll be dead, right? Therefore, you won\u2019t know what happens to the house. But, I think you can safely guess that you\u2019ll hurt your son.

We\u2019ve met Cece a few times before and she seems like a nice girl, but we have concerns about Cece\u2019s family.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife and I own a few rental properties and John stay in one of the properties rent free as he is still in grad school, and free housing is something my wife and I\u2019ve always agreed to provided for all our kids, especially while they are in school so that they don\u2019t have to worry about rent in a high cost of living area. The concern with Cece\u2019s family comes from having met the family a couple times before; they seems inappropriately interested in my wife and I\u2019s finances, and Cece\u2019s mother (from what I\u2019ve heard from my other kids and a little from John), is close to retirement, has no savings or plans set up for retirement. Her mother has multiple times attempted to move in and live rent free in one of my properties because according to her, it is \u201cher future son in law\u2019s house\u201d. My take is that Cece\u2019s mother sees John, who is about to graduate from med school, as their retirement security.\r  \n\r  \nJohn\u2019s my oldest and I\u2019ve signed a will where he gets a large amount of cash plus the property that Cece\u2019s mother was trying to move into. I\u2019m not sure if the mother knows that and that\u2019s why she was trying to move in, but John does know about what he is inheriting. My biggest fear is that somehow that family will end up with a piece of the house for whatever reason once I pass, John has a pure heart and always sees the good in people, and I think his future mother-in-law will take advantage of that. When John told me he is getting married to Cece, I requested he signs a prenup to protect his inheritance (and also prenups are advisable in general), but he was vehemently against it. I told him that he will be written out of the will and the house will go to our other kids if he marries her without a prenup, but seems like he is not budging, so i've gone ahead and started plans to leave the house to my other kid.  I think I have good reasons to not trust Cece\u2019s family and their intentions with my son. I\u2019m not going to tell a grown man who he can and can\u2019t marry but I want to protect what I am leaving for my children. My son has stopped talking to me and I'm not sure if I was that unreasonable.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most finance advisors will tell you to leave property to 1 person and cut out all the unnecessary crap. I say take John out of the will as he will disrespect your wishes unfortunately. If you decide to entrust it to your grandkids, you should put stipulations 1) everyone of his surviving kids must contribute equally to the home both bill and upkeep wise. If equal upkeep is not suitable for each of his kids then 2) the home may be appraised and sold directly to the surviving siblings at the leaving siblings portion. ( if he has 4 kids and the house is appraised at $100,000, sibling who doesn\u2019t want to help with upkeep gets $25,000 from siblings.) If  no siblings can afford to buy the property then 3) when sold outright the money is split equally amongst all of John\u2019s surviving children during the time of sale.
