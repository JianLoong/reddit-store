Great, we need more of those in the world. I have a masters degree in social work (not currently working in the field though) so they tell me about their experience, ask for advice on assignments, etc. That's kind of the extent of our \"friendship.\" I was recently brutally honest with them when they came to me for advice. They were venting about a recent conflict at their internship site and asked me how they should address/resolve it. I'll admit, I got frustrated because they vent to me a lot.\n\nI sent them a recap of the multiple issues they have had over the last two or three years, all of which are due to conflicts with colleagues, them disliking their supervisors, or in one case a client (or mock client I'm not sure) complained about them. Then I said \"My biggest piece of advice would be to really reconsider if this is the field for you because you are the common denominator in all of these issues. If you're struggling to get along with your colleagues then I worry you may not be effective with your clients.\"\n\nOf course they blew up, called me names, said I wasn't helpful, said I'm LGBTQ-phobic, etc. I think I could have worded it better but IMO my points are worth them considering.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I did not expect this to get as many responses. I'll address a couple things here:\n\n1. I have a masters in social work but I'm not a therapist and do not intend to be one (social work covers a lot of different professions), so no I don't feel like I should be expected to treat the friend as delicately as I would a client.\n2. To my knowledge, none of the disputes they have vented to me about have been about their gender identity. That said, their family are bigots so I know they are very hurt by those past experiences.\n3. Most of the conflicts stem from feedback. The friend does not take constructive criticism well and asks for advice on what to do. But usually it results in them feuding with the person who gave them the feedback because they perceive the person is being harsh, unreasonable, or just wrong. On one or two occasions the matters were personal but they involved people who they go to class or work with. For example not being included at a bar outing and confronting them resulting in an ongoing argument.\n4. Sorry for being vague. I don't want to paint this person as being terrible but they really do seem to be burning a lot of bridges over what I feel, professionally, are small issues, but to them are very big ones. That's not great when you're trying to become a therapist.", "created_utc": 1684506258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lwy2s/aita_for_being_brutally_honest_with_someone_about/", "score": 3140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have them take a few days to get over the hurt of the criticism, then go over the list one by one and have an honest talk about if each thing is valid. They can even write one thing that is valid/accepting of the criticism, and one defensive statement. Gently make suggestions if they feel nothing is valid, so they can see another POV from someone \"on their side\". For each valid criticism, help them think of a positive, proactive way they can change the situation; this puts them in charge of the issue, not the person complaining. All the negative stuff that you both agree is non-issue, scribble it off the list and ask them to give themselves permisson to throw those thoughts/complaints away, so its not in their mind and not building up unnecessary hurt and drama. After that, their \"action plan\" is to work on the valid list, and let them know they can come to you for brainstorming ideas. Having an action plan gives them control of the situation, relieves some of that defensiveness and hurt, and working towards progress puts an \"i'm handling this\" feeling instead of that whirlwind of feeling bamboozled or attacked.

Tell them about their issue with constructive criticism and that you\u2019re not willing to put up with being called names and having your name be smeared just because you gave your honest opinion. And stop letting yourself be a vent if being a vent makes you frustrated.

I just finished my undergrad in Behavioural Psychology and while I believe your delivery might have been a little harsh there are definitely people who need to hear this. I\u2019ve been working in the field as a case manager for about 6 months now and I definitely have coworkers who are burnt out to the point that they are the common denominator in many of their workplace and personal issues. Even some of my classmates throughout my undergrad were like this to some degree. If I\u2019m being honest even I was like that in my first year of my undergrad but much like what someone else said in their comment you have to learn to play the politics of the setting your in which is exactly what I did and it made college much easier", "Your \u201c1.\u201d point is pure hypocrisy so YTA", "NTA\nI am also currently studying in the same area (psychological science) and the biggest thing they teach us, from day one, is self reflection.

Clearly this person is incapable of receiving any criticisms and that means they have no business being in a position of trust with people that need a good therapist!", "NTA they come to you for advice. They then can't complain if they don't like or agree with that advice. They can either take it on board or reject it. Entirely up to them. It appears this is a common reaction which is the very point you are trying to highlight.", "Nta but give space, it sounds like they maybe had to fight a lot in life so they are on the defensive in general. Let what you said sink in, if they reach out again great. If. They try and combat you on your advice reiterate it and give space again. You don\u2019t have to be friends with this person", "NTA but I don\u2019t think this was the best way to go about it. Worrying about their issues handling conflict and wanting to help them learn to navigate these sorts of situations better before they enter a position of power with their clients is totally valid. But while they\u2019re actively venting about something isn\u2019t the time, and just saying \u201cyou\u2019re the common denominator, maybe don\u2019t be a therapist\u201d isn\u2019t helpful when they\u2019ve already put years into this path. \n\nWhat they really need is to sit down when they\u2019re in a good headspace and walk through each of the past incidents to identify places where they could have de-escalated the situation but chose not to. It\u2019s important, in that process, to make a really clear distinction between the things they do/say/express while in the situation and the feelings they vent afterwards. Getting angry doesn\u2019t necessarily escalate a conflict if you\u2019re able to put your emotions and ego to the side and be the bigger person in your interactions w/ the person you\u2019re conflicting with, then vent about it later in a way that doesn\u2019t get back to them. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to take an nuanced approach to analyzing power dynamics. Pushing back against your supervisor when they say or do something you disagree w/ is an extremely different thing than pushing back against a client, and the fact that they\u2019ve had issues not only w/ supervisors and colleagues but also friends and even a mock client indicates to me that they\u2019re approaching all interactions as though they\u2019re the one with the least power. While this may have been true for them growing up, it\u2019s not anymore, and certainly won\u2019t be if they start practicing as a therapist. It\u2019s their responsibility to process that trauma and learn to conduct themselves maturely when in a position of authority. \n\nUltimately, maybe some anger management therapy could be really good for them, especially since a practicing therapist will be the most qualified person to help them navigate this issue. You\u2019re absolutely NTA for pointing this issue out, but you\u2019ve done it in a way that triggered their defensiveness, which is ultimately unproductive. If you care about this person, I would apologize for how and when you brought it up and ask to meet up sometime when they\u2019re not actively going through one of these conflicts to discuss. Even if you don\u2019t owe them an apology (imho, it could go either way), at this point, that\u2019s what they need in order to be open to this conversation. Alternatively, you can distance yourself from them and declare them no longer a friend and therefore not your responsibility.

For someone that has run up against the \"it's you\" argument, for things that are objectively not, I imagine that constructive criticism is HARD.\n\nAnyone going into therapy as a profession should be able to take pushback without taking it as an attack. I say that as someone who has had therapy, once wanted to be a psychologist, and is heading back to getting therapy. From a patient/client standpoint - if I get addressed with aggression from my therapist because I disagree, that's the end of my sessions with that therapist. Not that we disagree, we can talk about that and that's why we're there, but any aggression and I'm out.

As you mentioned in your edit, they're not their colleagues' therapist so they don't have to treat the colleagues like they're clients? Also as a therapist myself, I've definitely been hurt by professor/supervisor's feedback (a professor, while I was still in school told me she \"didn't like my style of therapy\" as in she didn't like how I talked to clients.. It was totally out of left field as she was just observing a mock session and she didn't give me any tips on what I could do differently) and I've also had a supervisor who just conceptualized and approached therapy very differently from me so his criticism always hit a sore spot.
