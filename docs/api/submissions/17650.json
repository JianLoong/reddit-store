Great, we need more of those in the world. I have a masters degree in social work (not currently working in the field though) so they tell me about their experience, ask for advice on assignments, etc. That's kind of the extent of our \"friendship.\" I was recently brutally honest with them when they came to me for advice. They were venting about a recent conflict at their internship site and asked me how they should address/resolve it. I'll admit, I got frustrated because they vent to me a lot.\n\nI sent them a recap of the multiple issues they have had over the last two or three years, all of which are due to conflicts with colleagues, them disliking their supervisors, or in one case a client (or mock client I'm not sure) complained about them. Then I said \"My biggest piece of advice would be to really reconsider if this is the field for you because you are the common denominator in all of these issues. If you're struggling to get along with your colleagues then I worry you may not be effective with your clients.\"\n\nOf course they blew up, called me names, said I wasn't helpful, said I'm LGBTQ-phobic, etc. I think I could have worded it better but IMO my points are worth them considering.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I did not expect this to get as many responses. I'll address a couple things here:\n\n1. I have a masters in social work but I'm not a therapist and do not intend to be one (social work covers a lot of different professions), so no I don't feel like I should be expected to treat the friend as delicately as I would a client.\n2. To my knowledge, none of the disputes they have vented to me about have been about their gender identity. That said, their family are bigots so I know they are very hurt by those past experiences.\n3. Most of the conflicts stem from feedback. The friend does not take constructive criticism well and asks for advice on what to do. But usually it results in them feuding with the person who gave them the feedback because they perceive the person is being harsh, unreasonable, or just wrong. On one or two occasions the matters were personal but they involved people who they go to class or work with. For example not being included at a bar outing and confronting them resulting in an ongoing argument.\n4. Sorry for being vague. I don't want to paint this person as being terrible but they really do seem to be burning a lot of bridges over what I feel, professionally, are small issues, but to them are very big ones. That's not great when you're trying to become a therapist.", "created_utc": 1684506258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lwy2s/aita_for_being_brutally_honest_with_someone_about/", "score": 1337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm in my early thirties and my own mother couldn't be on the floor of a job she had in my lifetime for the first few days because they never had a sexual harassment meeting before. And *still* her first day someone walked up behind her wrapped their arms around her and picked her up off the ground and whispered in her ear \"not so little now am I?\" Turned out to be someone she used to baby sit that thought that would be funny and not absolutely terrifying to a woman at work. She very nearly broke his nose.", "List them.\n\nYou did it for them, but refused to do so for us to defend your side.\n\nPretty indicative after the red flag of \"I'm just brutally honest\"", "Op make an edit in the post", "I'm starting to wonder if you even understand adding 3 red flags doesn't help the one you initially had.\n\n\"Only one or two the matters were personal...involed people they go to class or work with\"\nDoesn't match up to \"most...stem from feedback\"\n\nNow which is it? People they work with or not? Because only people they work with can provide them feedback.", "No, OP pretty clearly said they blamed them and told them to change careers as advice.\n\nSee the flags for the red they are.", "They've not added anything to the scenario that wasn't told.  You are.  You need professional help.  Seriously.", "We\u2019re discussing this quote: \"If you run into an asshole in the morning, you've found an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole. \"", "I did not.\n\nThe edit doesn't change the fact the comment I replied to has faulty logic, but it does make OP NTA.\n\nSounds like OP's friend has some serious rejection sensitivity and should probably go through some therapy before trying to be one themselves.", "Well looks like OP edited and their friend is incapable of taking any sort of criticism. So yeah basically what we said. I'm sure they've gotten feedback that they didn't like and immediately went on the attack that someone is only criticizing them because they are a bigot.", "Its time to check your shoe", "Very informative, thank you! Saving for future reference", "Thank you very much for your help!", "Even though you updated, it's still not clear what exactly they're getting feedback on and other relevant information.", "^ bot", "I think if it was put more delicately, the point could be missed or dismissed.  People don\u2019t want to hear criticism and when you water it down, they often then don\u2019t hear it at all.", "Point taken. But instead were here now discussing if OP is a bigot even though there's not one indication that he meant that their roommies gender identity is the actual cause of their problems and workplace conflict. And not their personality or attitude.", "Please provide quotation. Because i cant find one quote where OP points to their roommate being nonbinary as the crux of the problem. Maybe, just maybe it's their personality that's the problem and not their gender. What OP did say is that the only reason they even mention that their roommate is non binary is so that people don't misgender them in the comments. That doesn't sound bigoted, does it?", "Fair", "Honestly thought I was at a different level of the thread, oh well", "It is time for you to use critical thinking and grow up.", "I\u2019m happy to help!", "When the point is \u201chey your identity might be resulting in you getting treated poorly by people,\u201d it might be worth saying it nicely otherwise you risk coming across like a bigot.", "You misreading my comments is not my problem.\n\nRead again, I've been very clear.", "Its time to check your shoe", "Their gender identity has never been an issue of any of the conflicts they've brought up to me. I don't know where you're getting that from.", "Ooooh I didn\u2019t mean that.  I didn\u2019t see anything indicating OP said or meant anything of the sort.  Did they?", "It doesn't mean you are right. Shitty personality also accounts for a common denominator.", "You pointed out that your friend called you phobic in the original post, so I was wondering if that was related. If their problems were related to them being non-binary and you leaned on that, I could see them saying you\u2019re phobic as a reply.", "It wasn\u2019t clear initially; the OP said something to\ntheir friend about them being the common denominator and the friend called the phobic. A reading between the lines made me wonder - OP says that wasn\u2019t the case. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I was right because you're arguing things I haven't said.\n\nSee further examples of red flag behavior in the edits op posted. Considering OP used an alt account to say \"NTA\" and argue with people who say \"YTA\" instead of using their actual account, I'd take that as yet another red flag."]}
