That\u2019s the crux of it\u2026there\u2019s range of reasons from like, \u201cWe\u2019re butting heads because the other person isn\u2019t pulling their weight on a group project\u201d to \u201cI just bulldoze my way through interactions and can never be wrong in an interpersonal conflict\u201d.", "NTA \n\nThat was good advice given in a very diplomatic way. Them suddenly calling you phobic is a total cop out. Their gender identity had nothing to do with the advice you gave. Now you know not to bother with them anymore.", "NTA\n\nraylan givens(though I'm sure he's not the first fake cowboy to say it): \"If you run into an asshole in the morning, you've found an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole. \"", "Info: did the conflicts involve prejudice against your friend for being a member of the LGBTQ+ community?", "It's hard to tell. Were their conflicts LGBTQ based? Like was a client/coworker being NB-phobic and that's what lead you to your blunt comments? If not, I don't think you did anything wrong here. I have known these common denominator people and they can be a chore. But, there are a lot of asshole people to work with, so maybe this is a specifically bad situation they're in. I think it's fair to tell them to really consider it, especially if they are asking for advice. \n\nIf it's bothering you how much they come to you, then maybe you can engage less and just let them figure things out. NTA, but maybe it's time to distance yourself from them.", "I'm gonna go with NTA, but with the caveat that a big recap unprompted (sounds like you started with the recap) was kind of an asshole move. It would probably have sufficed to come at it with more tact and only provide examples if asked.", "I'm pretty conflicted about this. I'm going to say YTA because I suspect you don't actually have enough info to justify saying something as extreme as \"you should reconsider your field\".\n\nI've a friend who vents to me about her work, and I also can't help but wonder if the common denominator is in fact her. At the same time, I do not know the extent to which her being a woman in a male-dominant field is a contributing factor in her experience, and whether her assertive personality may come across as caustic to others. When I tire of her vents, I simply tell her that I agree that her situation sucks, but I'm a bit tired and want to talk about happier things. At other times, I take a more cynical approach and say that she needs to learn to play company politics. But I never frame it as \"the problem is you\", mainly because I don't have first-hand experience of the situation and am unwilling to make such a strong assertion in the absence of definitive evidence.", "You obviously feel disdain for your friend's choice of career. They obviously thought you were a safe space to vent and explore their feelings. As the holder of a master's in social work, was this response of yours helpful? You allowed your negative feelings to build up until you hit your friend with the metaphorical bag of rocks. I suggest apologizing to this person and reframing your response to them (less brutal).

Responding with attacks on your character and calling you names does make them the AH.", "I will go with a soft YTA even though it's hard to tell much about your delivery from this post.\n\nPeople need to vent. Even people who are great at their jobs need to vent about their colleagues and supervisors. It sounds like you've become the go-to venting friend. And that's not ok with you. Instead of questioning their ability to do the work (and dismissing any real issues they could be having with colleagues, especially as a NB person), you could have told them that you'd love to offer them constructive advice but aren't comfortable with all the venting. You don't know if they're actually the problem bc you don't have all the info, so making that judgment isn't your place.", "INFO:  What were the conflicts?  This is important.

Or a mix of both and everything in between.", "YTA - This wasn't the right time to broach the subject, and didn't seem to do it with any tact. \n\nI understand this was building up, but you needed to have shown some restraint in the response. \n\nYou could have asked something to the effect of, \"Do you think you'll be happy in this field long term when these situations continue to arise?\" In your advice have you ever explained what they could do better in the situation, or have you been \"siding\" with them until now?\n\nIt sounds like they overreacted, but it also seems like you blew up.", "NTA. That is a big blow up for being honest. It is good advice, cause if they aren\u2019t happy now then they should look at it. You aren\u2019t their therapist.

I cannot tell you how much I have learned from my allys in that space. If you don't live that experience, you don't know what it's like and you'd likely be shocked what someone else has to deal with.

It's easier for them to play a victim card but when you get into the real world and workforce shit gets hard sometimes.", "NTA. It's a hard truth, and it probably could've been phrased better, but it's something they are going to need to truly take the time to think about and decide.

It\u2019s fair enough I think if they wanted an outsider perspective, but if it\u2019s constant for every little thing then that\u2019s ridiculous. Also at that point they are just using you for free therapy. Therapists do need therapy so if they don\u2019t have one yet that\u2019s their problem", "If its been going on for years, and they don't have the insight that their the problem,  its probably fair to tell them.\n\nNTA", "NTA but if you had such an issue with them venting to you I feel as though you should've communicated that beforehand.

They didn\u2019t like to hear anything negative, tough shit. You were only trying to help.", "NTA. If someone wants to go into the mental health field they need to be keenly aware that the person they vent to comfortably consents to being the one they vent to, especially if it\u2019s often. And it sounds like that wasn\u2019t the case. In addition, they need to be able to reflect on why they may have taken your advice harshly. They shouldn\u2019t just be searching for what they WANT to hear; and it\u2019s a big red flag if that\u2019s going to reflect in how they practice.

There\u2019s no reason to rip this person to shreds because you\u2019re \u201cfrustrated\u201d that someone enjoys talking to you and trusts your advice.
