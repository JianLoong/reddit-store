Great, we need more of those in the world. I have a masters degree in social work (not currently working in the field though) so they tell me about their experience, ask for advice on assignments, etc. That's kind of the extent of our \"friendship.\" I was recently brutally honest with them when they came to me for advice. They were venting about a recent conflict at their internship site and asked me how they should address/resolve it. I'll admit, I got frustrated because they vent to me a lot.\n\nI sent them a recap of the multiple issues they have had over the last two or three years, all of which are due to conflicts with colleagues, them disliking their supervisors, or in one case a client (or mock client I'm not sure) complained about them. Then I said \"My biggest piece of advice would be to really reconsider if this is the field for you because you are the common denominator in all of these issues. If you're struggling to get along with your colleagues then I worry you may not be effective with your clients.\"\n\nOf course they blew up, called me names, said I wasn't helpful, said I'm LGBTQ-phobic, etc. I think I could have worded it better but IMO my points are worth them considering.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I did not expect this to get as many responses. I'll address a couple things here:\n\n1) I have a masters in social work but I'm not a therapist and do not intend to be one (social work covers a lot of different professions), so no I don't feel like I should be expected to treat the friend as delicately as I would a client.\n\n2) To my knowledge, none of the disputes they have vented to me about have been about their gender identity. That said, their family are bigots so I know they are very hurt by those past experiences.\n\n3) Most of the conflicts stem from feedback. The friend does not take constructive criticism well and asks for advice on what to do. But usually it results in them feuding with the person who gave them the feedback because they perceive the person is being harsh, unreasonable, or just wrong. On one or two occasions the matters were personal but they involved people who they go to class or work with. For example not being included at a bar outing and confronting them resulting in an ongoing argument.", "created_utc": 1684506258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lwy2s/aita_for_being_brutally_honest_with_someone_about/", "score": 700, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I did the exact same thing to a friend, I lost my patience and said, maybe school isn\u2019t the right avenue for you? They were pursuing an art degree, not to become a teacher or something that would require the degree, but to become an artist. And they were having massive difficulties with navigating the world of higher education. I just really didn\u2019t know how else I could support them at that point. Every suggestion I\u2019d give, they\u2019d literally cry and give me a reason it wouldn\u2019t work. I had pursued an art degree, and quit, because I couldn\u2019t handle the criticism (I realize I am hyper sensitive) but I also worked for many years as an actual artist, so I know this is possible. I wasn\u2019t telling them to quit, in my mind, but to pursue a different path. \n\nI also have been the person to complain and I did realize\u2026the common denominator was me!

So I felt my advice to my friend was actually good advice. \n\nThey didn\u2019t think so and our friendship was never the same. I know that what they wanted/needed, was what we all want/need in that situation: to be heard and listened to and not have our problems solved.

Sometimes, you just snap. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, I think you lost your patience in the situation and maybe y\u2019all aren\u2019t meant to be friends, not to be harsh.

Social care positions are sometimes filled by people who want power.\n\nIf OP really was bigoted, I don't think his friend would go to him repeatedly for 2 years seeking his advice, which leaves me to believe his friend's blow up and calling OP bigoted was an unsubstantiated attack.\n\nImo OP you're NAH, you gave them your opinion when they've asked for it loads, and just wanted to flag their actions as you were concerned.", "I'm thinking NTA because they have come to you continually for professional advice and you again this time offered professional advice about their career.

It\u2019s likely OPs acquaintance/friend, they are being perfectly reasonable. \n\nI get how OP might feel like their advice was warranted. To OPs mind, the venting friend needs consistent advice to handle fairly minor workplace  interactions/conflicts that are overblown.

That's more like using a resource than being a friend", "I actually don't think this is relevant at all. OP's suggestion was to rethink whether this whole thing was going to work. If problems are continuously coming up with no real path to resolution, that sounds like good advice no matter where the nexus of the problems are.", "I think their reaction in the immediate accusation of being homophobic makes it abundantly clear that they are the problem in these interactions.
