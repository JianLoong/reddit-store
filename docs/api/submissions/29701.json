My relationship with his father wasn't exactly a healthy one, and so it was mutually decided that he wouldn't take a personal role in raising his baby. Instead, I'd raise him with my mom and dad (58f and 60m).\n\nMy parents had never approved of the relationship and certainly didn't like my boyfriend. Despite that, upon learning about my pregnancy they were absolutely amazing and provided me with a lot of support. Naturally I asked my mom if she would be my birthing partner, and she happily accepted. \n\nAs the months went on however, my mom started becoming distant with me. She was still wonderful and helped me so much with things like setting up a nursery in the spare room, rubbing my back when it ached and providing advice, but something seemed colder about her. Upon asking my dad he told me I was being silly and that mom was fine.\n\nOne night I came downstairs only to see mom crying on the sofa and clutching one of the soft toys we'd bought for my baby. She saw me and yelled at me to go upstairs and leave her be. She expressed that she still wanted to be my birthing partner the next day and I perhaps stupidly glossed over it.\n\nSoon enough the day came that I went into labor. I was concerned about mom's behavior but I wanted her with me, and she came into the delivery room. Maybe an hour into my labor, my mom said she felt stifled and needed to get some air. She was gone for over an hour and one of the nurses went to try and find her, but couldn't.\n\nI rang her and told her she was wrong to have left me, and she screamed at me that my labor was my problem, not hers. I hung up and basically spent the rest of my labor in tears. My dad came as fast as he could from work and was furious at my mom.\n\nSome extended family members are now saying that I was cruel to my mom for expecting her to be there for the whole birth, and they agreed with her that I shouldn't expect her to \"fix my problem\". I didnt agree but now I'm feeling guilty. Did I expect too much of my mom?", "created_utc": 1698320795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gum2s/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_was_wrong_to_leave_me/", "score": 2584, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you seem to be expecting a lot from your parents, this kid is your responsibility if they want to help you out that's great but they have no obligation at all to raise this child with you. You made the desicion to have a toxic relationship, you made the desicion to raise the child without the father so as parenting goes you are on your own they are the grandparents. \nN T A for telling your mom she shouldn't have leave you during the birth but you are an AH for wanting to put the responsibility to raise your child on your parents.

Your parents already raised their children yet they are now expected to change their routine to accommodate you and your child?

You decided to have the kid, so the kid is your responsibility, don\u2019t shove it off onto your aging parents.", "Yea this is definitely an ESH for sure\n\nI\u2019m 46 - my daughter is 23. If she came home after having dealt with some horrible guy I know I would\u2019ve warned her about pregnant. It wouldn\u2019t have been me putting my life on hold. Sorry not sorry. \n\nI look forward to being a grandparent - but my on duty parenting days are over and after all my hard work of raising her it\u2019s time for her to take over her own life, decisions and whatever outcome those decisions bring.\n\nSo you live with your parents, made a \u201cmutual\u201d agreement you\u2019d raise the child sans father. \nWere you mother and father in the bed with you getting pregnant? No, so that\u2019s not a mutual agreement. \n\nThey just stepped up to help you overcome your bad decisions - that now will affect an innocent child - their grandchild.\n\nWas mom wrong to walk out of labor - sure - that sucks. But trust me that\u2019ll be the first of many things that will suck, hurt you deeply and be bitter pills to swallow as you walk down this rough path. Trust me been there did that. \n\nInstead of focusing on her issues let this be the time you dig deep and start focusing on your own strengths and how you are going to handle your life with baby. \n\nDon\u2019t get complacent relying on others - cause all that\u2019s going to do it breed resentment and hurt feelings. Which is clearly on display now.\n\nIt\u2019s time to grow up and have hard conversations with yourself and the others around you.\n\nSounds like she avoided talking to you and you avoiding confronting the issues. This is on both of you", "INFO:\n\n> so it was mutually decided that he wouldn't take a personal role in raising his baby. Instead, I'd raise him with my mom and dad (58f and 60m).\n\nWho exactly decided you would raise him with mom and dad. Were they put in on this discussion. Or did you just assume because you lived with them that they would be helping raise the child. I mean your mom is almost 60, I'm sure it wasn't in her retirement plan to raise help raise a child. If you and your baby daddy decided that he wanted nothing to do with the child, that's your guys choice but you can't say he won't raise him so I'm going to raise him with my parents. Take responsibility and raise your child by yourself. If they can and want to help some that's awesome, but you shouldn't make them feel like they have to raise this child.", "Obviously your mom is overwhelmed by what\u2019s in store for her. The timing for her breakdown is truly unfortunate for you but you saw signs that things were not good with her and you chose to ignore them.  She still should have been there for the birth.

But at the same time, you are 23, it\u2019s not down to your parents to help raise him together, you are an adult. Your son is their grandchild. Maybe she\u2019s worrying about the cost, conparenting etc\u2026.. she didn\u2019t do things maturely, but does she want to do having a kid again? You aren\u2019t exactly a 14 year old who got caught having sex, be an adult about it all.", "You should look after you own kid.", "I agree with many of the comments regarding your Mom being overwhelmed and disappointed about putting her life on hold to help raise your baby.\n\nAlso agree that at 23 you're old enough to raise your own child. It sounds like your parents (but especially your Mom) were there for you during your pregnancy, doing everything a partner would do. I mean, she rubbed your back which is a nice ritual SO's do during pregnancy. \n\nI will offer a different perspective: has your Mom ever had a late term miscarriage or still birth? Or have you lost a sibling? I lost my little girl when she was an infant and I still have stabs of grief at baby showers, holding little ones, visiting newborns in the hospital, etc. after many years. I don't think I could be someone's birthing partner because I'm not sure I could be there for them 100% because I wouldn't know if/when a flood of emotions would come during labor and how I would handle it. \n\nOP, I'm sorry you lost your birthing partner during labor but maybe give Mom a little grace? She's doing SO MUCH for you.", "Your \u201cplan\u201d to \u201craise (my kid) with my mom and dad\u201d makes you YTA. Your mom doesn\u2019t want to raise your kid.

Grow up.", "YTA, *You* decided to get pregnant and also decided that the baby daddy doesn\u2019t have to lift a finger because your parents would be there to help out. Ever thought about the fact that your parents are simply *done* with parenting and are now (quietly in the case of your dad) resentful? \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a nice thing from your mother to leave you there, and you\u2019re right in wanting her there, but I think reality hit her all at once when she was sitting there with you. Because her easy life where she was done raising her kid is now fully gone, since she will probably be the one who will have to now have all those sleepless nights again, combined with everything else that comes with babies. \n\nDo them and yourself a favor, and get a job and start looking for a place of your own as soon as you\u2019re able to. Essentially forcing your parents to become newborn parents again (because there\u2019s no way you can do this alone- and you *chose* to do this without the help of baby daddy) is a major asshole move.", "There\u2019s more to this story we\u2019re not aware of.

Your mom let you down but you're 23, not 16. You are a full grown adult. You don't need to raise your baby \"with\" your mom and dad. You can just...raise your baby. Lots of people do.  I'm wondering if the root of your problem is that you've essentially communicated to your parents that you expect them to be extra parents to this child, permanently, because you can't manage without them. You say your mom \"happily\" agreed to be your birth partner but from what you describe it sounds more like she agreed under duress. And when it came time to actually BE your birth partner, she couldn't see it through. \n\nI suspect you're having some cognitive dissonance here because, on the one hand, you really want to believe your parents are totally cool with raising a whole other kid from infancy onward, but you are also seeing some signs that giving you the amount of support you think you need, is just beyond them at this point in their lives (or at least in your mom's life).", "Your mom sucks for leaving but I don\u2019t know what parent what\u2019s to be a partner/co parent to their grandchild.

Instead, she is facing another twenty years of parenting because her grandchild's father is a deadbeat and the choice is to step in or watch her daughter suffer. It seems like the birth overwhelmed her and she is trying to deal with zero support. Did you really talk to your mom after completely changing her life forever? Have you discussed how incredibly huge it is to expect your parents to literally start over with costs - time, money - of raising another kid? You don't mention what the family dynamics are in terms of chores ... Does mom do most with dad \"babysitting\" occasionally? There is a lot going on and I feel a lot is missing from your post.

Whatever her reasons are, she was not able to complete her end of the agreement. She may need to talk to a therapist. \n\nYou decided to raise your baby with your parents. That's nonsense. They had their kid, and they raised her. It is not fair, and it is not right to expect your senior citizen parents to be responsible for a baby. They should be enjoying their retirement and their final years. They should not be expected to RAISE another child. They should be expected to be doting grandparents if that's what they want to do, but to put the burden of raising a kid on them at their age is awful on your part. \n\nYou chose a bad partner. That's not their fault. Many of us choose bad partners, unfortunately. But it's not up to your parents to pick up the pieces because you and your boo fell out. You need to make him responsible for helping to raise that baby, even if it only includes child support. Your parents should not be spending their lifetime of savings taking care of your baby. \n\nBeing your birthing partner was too much for your mom. Why she couldn't express this to you, I don't know.

She shouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019m also curious what screaming actually means - you were running on probably hormones, fumes, fear and who knows what else so it\u2019s very possible she was just stern/firm and sounded angry and you took it as screaming because you were vulnerable. \n\nBe an adult and talk to her. You\u2019re a parent now, your mom and dad are helping you.

OP saw Mom struggling and becoming distant, so she asked DAD what was wrong and went with his answer. Sounds like she knew asking mom wouldn't give her the answer she wanted. \n\n\nAnd I wonder the dynamic between Mom and Dad in the home.

Good luck and congratulations.", "Y\u2019all are WILD in these comments. Regardless of the help OP and her family agreed to in regard to raising the baby has no bearing on the actual situation at hand.

Saying OP is the asshole for expecting her mother to remain true to her word is insane.\n\nI feel like what people are really judging her on is having a baby with a man she shouldn\u2019t have, but shit happens.

It seems like she has some other things going on that she might need help processing or learning to articulate, but that is not on you. Going forward, do not count on support from your mom, and you should probably rethink your long term plan of living with and raising your kid with your parents since it does not seem like your mom is onboard.

Your entitlement is overwhelming.", "NTA.\n\nIdk what your mom was/is going through but whatever it is, it's not an excuse to take off when her own daughter's in labor, especially when she agreed to be your birthing partner.

We parents are there to guide our children through life and, if we've done our job fairly well, they will be successful in their own right by whatever matrix is deemed important at the time.\n\nThis part is as a mother who cried when she heard of a pregnancy involving one of her children. I cried due to the situation knowing the grandchild would be facing hardships due to hereditary issues. My tears were not for my child who faced parenthood before fully maturing, nor for the knowledge of the hardships to come. My tears would never keep me from giving support as needed - in the delivery room or out of it. That's my child and grandchild, and I'm there for whatever they need, for however long they need it.\n\nNext is as a single mother with small children. Being a single parent is something that will make you take stock in yourself quite often. It won't be every day because you're going to be too busy tending to their needs while working full time, and there are only so many hours in a day. After kiddos are in bed and you jump in the shower you're going to be too busy running the To Do list for the next day, as well for the rest of the week, and then realizing that you're running out of hot water because you basically fell asleep while standing up and...did I rinse my hair? Wait...did I *wash* my hair?! And yet you wouldn't trade it for anything because in those small glimpses you realize it's you and the kiddos against the world and. You. Will. Win!

You will not expect them to be full time daycare for your child, whether you're working or not. You will not expect anything from your parents except for love and support.\n\nThis is what you will do: learn from other people's mistakes so you don't have to go through those pains yourself. You will get a job, if you don't have one already, and you will either find your own place to live, or you will pay rent to your parents and help them around the house. You will cultivate friendships while navigating motherhood. You will also learn such techniques as bartering, side hustles, boss babe moves, and psychological warfare as these are skills all good parents know, and single parenthood mandates.\n\nYour parents are not co-parents to your child, do not treat them as such.

I mean, the OP is 23, so how much help does she need?", "My money is on this or her parents lost a child soon after having her (she might not recall if she was very little) and this is bringing up a ton of feelings.", "Or maybe OP could help her deal with them. Maybe her husband has said she's stuck with all the work of raising the baby.  Maybe its overwhelming while she tries to be supportive.  Maybe OP said something unkind to her but OP doesn't know it because she's young. And the world is still all about her.", "So shouldn't it be YTA then?  This seems to be OP's mess and she's expecting her mother to handle too much.", "She may also have some unresolved trauma from her own birth. I almost died during mine, and so did the baby. I though everything was fine until I went to the dentist about a year later. I broke out in a cold sweat and had a panic attack from the lights, smells and lying down. \n\nHer mom may not have been honest with herself about beating able to handle it.", "Yeah, agreed. She might also be feeling her own age as well, coming to terms with the fact that she won\u2019t be the young mom and is getting older.", "That\u2019s a lot of assumptions.", "I would say there might be something else unknown. Parents hide past trauma really well. Sometimes, even from their partner. However, this definitely sounds like there is something else going on besides the obvious. \n\nI would not take it personally and give her time to regroup. Then maybe try to talk to her about it but leave a door open for her to not talk if she is not ready. Just make it clear that you love her, appreciate her support and help, but are aware this is your child to take care of.", "Yeah, agreed with this. It sounds like Mom may have been struggling with this situation for a bit and was trying to stay supportive. And then chose the worst time to be overwhelmed by it.", "Oh yeah, she's definitely ruining her parents lives, or at least their next few years.", "Mom probably didn't \"pick the time\".

OP said in her comments that her parents were basically strong-armed into housing her and supporting her financially \"until she can save up enough money to buy her own house\" because she can't afford to take care of herself or her baby. She even said she knows she's stressing them out and burdening them, but that she doesn't feel guilty because she wanted a baby and can't afford it and there's nothing she can do about it now.

That's just ridiculous.", "FFS this issue isn't about the parenting responsibilities, it's about ***the birthing process.***  The comments here have taken a tangent so that y'all can feel superior.  The mother screamed that OP's labor was her problem *after she agreed to be the birthing partner.*", "Right? She\u2019s not 15. She\u2019s a grown adult. Let her parents be grandparents, not substitute mom and dad.", "It sounds like mom and dad had actually agreed with that plan, so I vote NTA as it seems mom doesn't know how to use her words. During labor is not the time to communicate she has a problem \n\nFurthermore, mom being present during delivery is relatively common because it's supposed to be about emotional support. Increased stress actually elevates the risk of complications during delivery. Stepping out would be one thing, but OP had even reconfirmed with mom she was ok being there, and mom did not give a time frame of when she'd be back orwhere she was\n\nLastly, if something had happened, it is extremely necessary to be able to locate mom quickly. If OP had become unable to make medical decisions, a delay in finding mom could actively delay medical care to OP. During labor, she at least needed to be contact contactable. \n\nThe question was whether or not OP had a right to be angry at mom for ditching during labor. The answer to that is yes. Situation aside, mom is not communicating her feelings to OP. OP is not a mind reader. OP even verbally reconfirmed mom's presence. During labor is not the time or place to suddenly make a stand. Even stepping out would have been fine if there had been a way to get a hols of her/they knew where she was\n\nMom still needs to use her words.

The parents already raised their own children. When they finnally ended their \"job\", OP surprised them with a child she wanna raise with them. Did she even ask them if they were on board? Or just assumed they would steped in?! \n\nMy guess, mom were, in fact, happy with the news about the baby because she though about having a baby to visit and play sometimes. But, as time went by, she started to see that she would be another parent to the kid, on call 24/7, instead of a grandmother. \n\nHer timing was bad, but I cant judge her. Sometimes, people break unexpectedly. \n\nI guess ESH. The grandmother because she could I least call her husband to replace her at the hospital. OP because she made all this decision without much thinking and assuming way to much of her parents.", "Yeah, 23 and having a baby and expecting them automatically to \"help\"?

If I ever had to guess, my own mother would LOVE this arrangement lol, although that\u2019s just way too much for me haha. That said, we have no reason to believe that the parents didn\u2019t happily agree to this. Many grandparents would be keen to be so closely involved with their grandkids, alongside responsible parents. And many would not, true too. Perhaps their arrangement looks a whole lot less like having a kid dumped on you and more like a village effort. 23 isn\u2019t too young to be a mom for many, and she could be a great mom, working with her parents to raise a child they all love and are cool with doing so.

Especially with OP saying she caught her mom crying with a baby toy in her hand and getting more emotionally distant.\n\nToo many people seem to be caught up in \"young daughter is ruining her parents retirement years\".

It could be compounded by the retirement stuff, but it sounds a lot more like a panic attack over a traumatic body experience.", "That\u2019s exactly what I thought when I read that she was crying while holding a stuffed animal. That sounds like resurfacing trauma.", "Exactly. Well said. The daughter is relying too much on her parents. They don't want to raise another child.

Sounds fishy", "This is what I was thinking. Imagine raising a kid for 23 years and be ready to relax and retire just to have another child dropped on you. On top of this (and this is speculation on my part ofc), OP's father seems less affected. It makes me wonder what the contribution from each parent was when raising OP.

Active labor? That's a bit tricker, because that's when the contractions are the worst and new moms have a hard time vocalizing what they need to the medical staff because sometimes they just don't know. Transition labor stage?

Because chances are it just hit Mom like a ton of bricks that she is now going to be raising her daughter's child since her daughter seems to be incredibly immature and incapable of taking real responsibility for her actions.", "Just like OP does not seem to know what she is getting to, OP's mother did not know what her limit would be until she hit the wall.\n\n OP's mom left at when OP was medically monitored by highly trained medical personal.  It was medically the best possible time for her to have stepped away.  Besides, she had already been through one birth with OP.", "She found her mom crying holding a baby toy. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going on here - mom is overwhelmed and op sounds entitled. I am so incredibly sad for the mom", "OP did asked her what\u2019s wrong. Her mom simply chased her away. It\u2019s hypocritical to put all responsibilities on OP blaming her of acting like an entitled child who\u2019s acting irresponsible, but supporting her mom by doing exactly the same. Like you said: Talking goes BOTH ways!\n\nOP asked her multiple times, while one should be enough. It\u2019s no wonder OP hasn\u2019t learned to be grown up by now while the person who should guide her to that point didn\u2019t reached it by herself in the double of lifespan/ lifestages. That doesn\u2019t means OP has a free pass for acting immature - she has to pull herself together NOW - but just because OPs current position isn\u2019t the optimum that doesn\u2019t mean her support system is valid to do the same.\n\nThis is a situation where it\u2019s understandable that everyone involved struggles with handling it. It\u2019s a challenging situation for everyone. But that doesn\u2019t means everyone gets a free pass to act like a maniac against her. Many people here are acting like she\u2019s doomed and her life were over and should be happy about being treated like shit. She just became a single mother, that\u2019s it. If people wouldn\u2019t treat it like an life ending mistake it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal in the first place. Her life just got a little more challenging than most people prefer. She\u2019s not a monster, so stop treating her like an outlaw.", "None of that has anything to do with \u201cis OP an asshole for being upset that her mother abandoned her during labor after promising to be her labor partner/is her mother an asshole for doing so.\u201d\n\nNo, the OP is not an asshole and yes, the mother is an asshole.\n\nAnd you have the most f\u2019d up view of parenting if you can\u2019t see this.   \n\nNone of the other stuff matters once someone (your own daughter!) is in labor and in the process of giving birth. It can all come back go once that is done. But for that period of laboring, if you said you were going to be there to support her, you be there to support her.", "Doulas can be free if you hire one in training. My first doula was hired through a program, so cost me nothing. More people need to know. My husband left during the labor for my first (we knew it might be a problem for him as he has vasovagal syncope), so for my next children, I hired doulas. I didn\u2019t even know about doulas when I was pregnant with my first.", "I got my first doula through a program and it cost me nothing.\n\nEdited to add, medi-CAL covers doula services.", "You\u2019re right, my mistake, I read it incorrectly.", "Yes. Don't make promises you know you can't keep due to your own trauma, I say this as someone who can speak from experience of avoiding things and saying no when I know I won't be able to handle helping. You don't get to abandon your child who needs you during an event that can be incredibly traumatic for some people after promising MULTIPLE time you would be there. You also don't get to SCREAM at said child over the phone. Giving birth is incredibly scary for some women, I thought I was going to die during my labor, my mom was there for me the whole way through it even when I was rude to her at times because of how scared I was. So yeah her mom is an asshole for making a promise she couldn't keep and abandoning her daughter when she needed her.", "Then she should have talked to her daughter about these possibilities instead of just brushing her off multiple times when she expressed concern about her mother, like when OP found her mother Crying with a baby toy only to have her mother double down and say she will still be there for OP at the birth. I am not saying you don't get to struggle I am saying don't make the promise in the first place if you know you are struggling or will struggle. Or you know ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE how you are feeling to the person you made the promise to so they know you're not doing well. Don't make promises you aren't sure you can keep, is that better for you? Also her actions of just straight up leaving her daughter during labor could have also gone very wrong for OP and given her her own unresolved trauma to deal with. You don't get to risk traumatizing someone else because of your own trauma, again COMMUNICATION on the part of the mother should have happened way sooner about how she was feeling.", "I didn't say it was ok. I said I understand. She likely felt obligated to agree because it was her daughter, and wanting to fix your child's mistakes doesn't immediately stop at 18. \n\nIt's wrong because she's not asking for babysitting every so often, she's literally asking them to give up their hard-earned retirement and to raise a child they had no hand in creating because she's content to let the father be a deadbeat. \n\nAgain, it probably suddenly hit her what she had agreed to (assuming dad didn't agree for them both, which also seems like a distinct possibility at this point) and what she was giving up when the *idea* of a baby became a reality. I wouldn't be at my best then either.", "People aren't perfect, and it's wild that it's the OPs bad decisions that got them here, but she's the only one being granted grace.", "I believe you. I'm just not so willing to call someone an asshole for being weaker than you.", "Exactly", "This is speculation because obviously we don't have the full story, but I get the feeling that dad wants to be the hero while he expects his wife to do all or most of the work. Men of that generation rarely contributed a lot to childcare, so even if he INTENDS to do more now, he probably has very little clue what he's volunteering for. And it's far more likely that he is not actually planning to carry much of this burden beyond the financial. I'm basing this on how OP has related her interactions with both parents and the way that her dad seems very unconcerned about his wife's feelings.", "> she was scared, her mum agreed to being there, then was acting funny but still agreed to be there, then went there and halfway through\n\nThey're both scared.  And both mother and daughter have a hard time talking about it with each other", "OP is an adult who sees no problem with having mom and dad bail her out of her bad decisions. Probably a common theme throughout OP\u2019s life. Op is an AH for ever asking this of her parents in the first place! She can\u2019t see the problem with that ask at all. It\u2019s one thing to have support from mom and dad, it\u2019s another to say you\u2019ll be raising your child along side your parents. It\u2019s absolutely mind boggling and mom is likely overwhelmed herself because she knows just how much of the responsibility of raising this child is going to land on her.", "\u201cInstead, I\u2019d raise him with my mom and dad\u201d\n\nUh, no. Your baby your problem. She\u2019s 23 not 16. The harsh reality is when you hit adulthood in the eyes of the law only the parent is responsible for the kid.", "Kind of is ops responsibility to gauge other people. Like gauging friends or partners. Its grown-up stuff, no doubt.  Time to grow up. I see mom was struggling for some time and had no support.  At 58, her mom is longing for retirement.  Poof, gone.", "The next day. Or the times she said mom was distant.  Its as if people don't think mothers are human beings.  For instance,  if op screamed at her mother to go away, as teens do, usually a person circles back for discussion.", "In other comments, OP states that she expects her parents to financially support her and her son until she has enough money to \u201cbuy\u201d a house - not rent.  She decided to get pregnant with a man who she knew was incapable of being a parent and to keep the baby even though she had no way of supporting herself and a child.  Her parents got to decide absolutely nothing.  \n\nSo, yes, her mother had a mental crisis during the birth and left the room.  But, perhaps OP can extend her a little grace, considering she has impacted her mother\u2019s life for a lot longer than it takes to deliver a baby.  Her mother\u2019s burdens have just begun and will not end for years.  OP\u2019s mother *is not* abandoning her daughter, in fact, she is taking up the slack for OP\u2019s poor decision making.", "I guess you think mom has no right to be depressed, cry or have feelings. Everything is all about OP and nobody but OP, right? \n\nMom was probably overcome with despair when it hit her, I\u2019m going to be raising this child until I die, no matter how sick or tired I get. I thought I was going to be able to get some rest in my old age and now I never will. She was right to leave instead of bursting into hysterical tears in front of OP.  She\u2019s probably been fighting depression for weeks or months and just broke down at a bad time. \n\nMom is not a doormat, she\u2019s a person. Obviously OP has never stopped to think people this age find a crying baby absolutely exhausting and don\u2019t have the stamina of their younger years. I\u2019ve seen it with a relative who\u2019s a grandmother, she had her grandson over a couple of hours and then went to bed and slept the rest of the day. There\u2019s a reason menopause exists. \n\nOld people can\u2019t stay up all day and night without it affecting their health. OP thinks she can fuck up her life and they will always pick up the pieces no matter how old they get. Stressed out old people get sick because their immune system is not up to constant stress and exhaustion any more. They can\u2019t do it. Mom knows, and OP couldn\u2019t care less. \n\nOP needs to get to work chasing down dad for child support, get welfare or whatever other aid she can get, and work on a plan to stand on her own two feet as soon as possible. Get some money coming in. And there are programs to provide free or low cost childcare, she should look into that. I know someone who is getting that and she couldn\u2019t work without it. She has a toddler and dad is not around. \n\nOP should talk to a social worker and see what\u2019s available, there are a lot of programs people don\u2019t know about. Look for help somewhere besides mom and dad, they paid their dues. Quit being an albatross around their necks and make phone calls to get as much burden as possible off them. A young person with a child isn\u2019t a helpless victim, there are things you can do so they don\u2019t have to do all the heavy lifting. They\u2019re old.", "Yea, so it is very unlikely OP knew about them. Especially that they could be free. That sounds like taking advantage of people in training, though.\n\n\nIt also sounds like OP expected unlimited support from her parents.", "Doulas are not covered by insurance in my state, so they can run thousands of dollars. They\u2019re currently working on a bill to get them covered by insurance and Medicaid.\n\nIt is definitely a privilege thing where I live, but I\u2019m glad you were able to get one for free! I wish everyone could have someone to support them during labor!", "> You also don't get to SCREAM at said child over the phone. \n\nIt was in response to OP doing it first!  \n\nAnd you don't know when a trigger is going to be more than you can handle.  That's part of it.  \n\nYou have to be very young or had a pretty cushy life.  No one with real world experience would be like this.", "Yea, I said the same thing in another comment. Mom and Dad aren't retirement age. So, between Dad, Mom, and OP...who is going to work and who is going to watch the kid?\n\n\nAnd OP said she doesn't plan on moving out until she can BUY A HOUSE. Not even rent a studio apartment.", "Yeah that is true. From my p.o.v the Mum has been through this before unless obviously OP was adopted. Surely mothering instinct would be to be there for your daughter. I am not in anyway trying to stick up for one or the other jus simply give my opinion", "It\u2019s also her mum\u2019s responsibility to be honest about her feelings and boundaries. Gauging people becomes so much easier when the people around you aren\u2019t sending you mixed signals, shutting you out, or downright lying to your face. \n\nOP has a lot of growing to do and should have worked harder to figure out her mum\u2019s feelings about this whole thing and not taken it for granted that they\u2019d be thrilled to give up their retired life to raise her kid. But the mum isn\u2019t helping OP, or herself, by hiding her true feelings, shutting OP out, or pretending she\u2019s fine when she\u2019s not. Whatever is going on, she clearly hasn\u2019t even told her husband about it. \n\nI *suck* at communicating my feelings. That means I\u2019ve often been roped into situations I\u2019m not fully comfortable with. And that has been my fault for not expressing my discomfort. And when that\u2019s combined with a pushy, oblivious or entitled personality, it\u2019s a miserable time for all. In those situations I have been an arsehole (mostly to myself tbf) for not being honest and communicating my feelings, and the other person has been an arsehole for being pushy, entitled, and assuming everyone would be happy to cater to them. \n\nOP needs to mature and take more responsibility for her choices, and mum needs to learn to communicate.", "I'm in the UK and have never heard of anyone having one. They don't seem to be a thing over here, so that's another thing.", "Doulas have to do like 20 births before certification so if people contact their county, they might be able to find a trainee. Mine was provided through a county certification program. I also had a trainee for my fourth birth but she came for free with the doula I paid (who also charged me less money than her normal amount based on my income and needs)", "If you've ever been in labor, screaming is a thing.  Pain, nausea, exhaustion, fear, emotional anguish...it's not like you just wait calmly until the baby whooshes out in a rush.", "Exactly. OP seems pretty selfish and inconsiderate of her parents. Obviously mom should have handled it better, but she's human and clearly trying to support her daughter.", "Mom is probably trying to be supportive at a time when it's hard. But yes, grandma needs to speak up.", "Yes they are\n\nhttps://doula.org.uk/"]}
