I kinda can see why your parents are divorced. You are a grown man now and can choose how to spend holidays. Don't allow yourself to be manipulated. It's not like you fail to visit your mom at all.", "NAH because some trips and opportunities aren't always available so jumping on this trip does sound fun. That said, you could have made more of an effort to keep your mom feeling included like having an early Christmas or doing something to make it up to her. It makes sense she's upset but I don't think your parents should expect you to do alternating holidays for the rest of your life", "I'm gonna get downvoted here, but NTA.\n\nYou're effing 21 years old.  If the trip in question had been an all expenses paid trip that you won, and you HAD to take it when it 'was your mom's turn' would she be upset and expect you not to go just for her????  And would you???  Come on.\n\nAlso, OP is male and I'm willing to bet that's a BIG factor in this.  Mom's probably aiming whatever leftover resentment from the divorce for her ex at OP because hey, like father like son, right?\n\nMom needs to grow up.  What is she gonna do if/when OP has HIS OWN family and they either start their own traditions or visit with OP's new ILs every year?\n\nDownvote away!!!!!", "NTA. You are an adult. The custody agreement is moot. Do what you want.", "You can do what you want but how can you honestly be surprised that your mother is hurt by your choice. She probably didn\u2019t express that initially because she was shocked and trying to be cool with it. The reality is she was really hurt and rejected by you.", "YTA. I can only hope that one day you'll be mature enough, or have enough empathy, to understand why.", "*<my father and his gf planned a trip to a place that I have always wanted to go to and that I knew I would enjoy a lot. When he told me about the trip initially, he did remind me that it was my mother's turn this year.* ***But he did add*** *that I was always welcome to come along if I wanted to.>*\n\nYour dad knew you wanted to go there.\n\nYour dad knew you were supposed to spend the Holidays with your mum.\n\nYour dad booked a vacation to your dream location during said holidays.\n\nYour dad invited you to tag along, all expenses paid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**INFO** : Did your dad plan all this to hurt your mother?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA for being enticed by your all paid dream vacation.\n\nYour dad is the T A in this story though, not your mom.", "INFO - OP mentioned he spends no more time with her than normal if he sees her for the holidays.  Does this mean he lives with or very close to his mother?  Does he see her much more than he sees his father on a regular basis?\n\nDoes OP have siblings who were able to spend the holidays with their mother?", "YTA and a massive one. You knew, you just wanted to go on holiday and couldn't give a flying fig about how it might make your mum feel. You are so self involved it hurts.", "I don't think you're an asshole, but absent other context I do think you're going to come to regret this behavior in years to come.", "YTA.\n\nHas it occurred to you that your mother can't AFFORD to take you on these fabulous trips?  It also might be that your dad is trying to buy your love by taking you on trips when it's your mom's turn to host you for the holidays.\n\nMost divorced women see a drop in their lifestyle after divorce.  That's a fact.", "Nta. \n\nHere's the thing. If you enjoy the trip more than being with your mom, there's a reason for that. you can always swap holidays, too. Like, it's moms year for Xmas, but dad's doing a thing you want to, so spend Thanksgiving with mom. Or whatever. You can see both sides of your family. There's nothing wrong with spending more time with the part of your family you enjoy. Nta", "He has that fuck you money.", "is it manipulating him to tell him how she feels? I don't think so. She's not obliged to put on her mom face now he's an adult. He needs to realise that she's an adult with her own emotions and feelings. He seems to see her as a thing only there for his own amusement without agency or feelings.", "When he gets a partner, I hope that partner won't be bribing him to stay with her.", "The \"can someone be upset with me for this?\" posts often come from people who know that their loved one was going to be upset, but want people to say they would have made the same choice. OP is young, but he'd have to be pretty naive to not know this was going to upset his mother. And that's his choice - he can choose a holiday over spending time with her, that's not illegal, but actions have consequences, and upsetting his mother is one of them for this particular action. \n\nI wouldn't have done this if I was in OP's shoes, but I have quite a good relationship with my mother and wouldn't want to hurt her, especially given OP's father 100% knew what he was doing. I guess if OP has a bad relationship with his mother and doesn't care about hurting her feelings, that's another story.", "Better study hard kid.", "Ahahahah at least now we know why you're confused about being an AH or not- there's just air between your ears lol", "Holidays are supposed to be about family, not spending stupid amounts of money on things.", "And, yet, when OP needs mom for something -- \"Oh, no, I broke my wrists, can I recuperate at your house and have you take care of me,\" it's all gonna be about 'family,' isn't it?\n\nI look forward to mom pointing out how that doesn't sound like much fun, and maybe dad and his gf can field this one.", "I think it wouldn\u2019t be if she told him honestly, and ideally before he went on the trip. Waiting until it\u2019s too late, and essentially withholding affection or attention, rather than tell him how she feels, is passive aggressive. Maybe it\u2019s a one-off, and she doesn\u2019t typically do it, but it\u2019s not healthy behavior.", "I'm going to get downvoted for this...\n\nDid you see this part:\n\n>When I spend the holidays with my mother, it's usually very boring. We just stay home and visit **family members that I don't really enjoy being around**. My mother and I **don't even spend more time together than usual**.\n\nSo it reads like OP's mom doesn't put much effort into the holiday or do anything special with her kid\\*.  OP's dad made the effort to make sure OP had a fun holiday.  \n\n\\*And to be clear, it doesn't have to be expensive to be special.  There are tons of things around Christmas time (Christmas markets, caroling, going ice skating, etc.) that are local and relatively inexpensive that they could have done together.\n\nJust speculating based off of the limited information provided in the OP.", "Well the good thing is with his Dad's vacation plans, he's family! He's not fucking off to Telluride with his friends for a ski orgy.", "They're about family you love not spending it visiting family you don't want to be around.", "Maybe his Mom will jerk him off like that broken arms story on Reddit.", "I'm not going to downvote you; I think from OP's perspective an ordinary Christmas with family wasn't going to win against dream vacation with all expenses paid. I also suspect that good ol' dad wasn't trying to make things fun for OP in itself so much as lure him along to hurt mom further.   \n\nAlso, given that OP is an adult who can make adult choices (as the \"not the asshole\" people emphasizes), maybe he can start learning that not everything is about maximizing fun or expecting to be entertained by his parents.  \n\nAnd, unless the \"family members that I don't really enjoy being around\" includes mom, it doesn't really change that his choice here was hurtful to his mom.", "But what if his mum enjoys it. Sometimes, you do things you don't like for those you care for.\n\nYou can't tell me everyone likes their in-laws. So many people don't get along with their in-laws but will spend time with them for weddings, christmas, hannukah, Kwanza, Eid, etc. because they care for their spouse.", "Didn't wanna go there, but maybe Dad and gf?", "And sometimes you miss out on things you like because those you care about don't like it.\n\nBesides there's a difference between disliking someone and not wanting to be around them when possible.", "OP - I'm going to put this gently, but when you drop your \"sure thing\" for a \"good time\", the people left behind 1. know it and 2. remember it.   \n(Now putting it this way is a bit unfair to your father - he sounds very present - but the point needs to be made, you dropped your mother because it's \"very boring\" and went for the free trip.)\n\nAnd you are surprised that your mother's feelings are hurt?  \nYTA.\n\nThis is a pretty stark example of a lack of emotional sensitivity and emotional maturity. It is common sense that your mother is not happy. You all had an (even if informal) agreement that everyone understood - this was \"her\" year.  \nYou \"decided to join your dad on his trip\". You \"told this to \\[your\\] mother\". She \"seemed fine with it\". You \"didn't really see a problem.\"\n\nLet's rephrase this: your father made you an offer, you took him up on it, you told your mother you were going with your father - at this point, she could have argued with you, or she could bite her tongue. It sounds like she bit her tongue. You assumed everything was fine.\n\nCould she have communicated better? Absolutely. However, the fact you thought you were in smooth waters at this point is *really* short sighted.\n\nDid you at least plan \"something\" with your mother to celebrate the holidays, even if they weren't on the days-of? A lunch with the family to visit, a standard meal, etc? Something like that would have been wise to try to plan ahead of time with her. \n\nPlease remember - family is not always about the fun times and the trips. Family are hopefully the people who are there for you when things get tough. But for that to work, you have to be willing to put the mileage in (and not always the free, all expenses paid vacation type miles, but the visiting family you don't always like spending time with miles).", "Eh soft YTA. Understandable you wanna do something a bit more exciting for xmas however you did blow your mom off and not understanding that she would be upset and not want to ruin your trip for you by expressing it makes you TA.

I think that deep down you knew that your mom wanted you to visit for the holidays. Rather than talking to your mom about the reasons that you didn't want to come, you bailed to go with your fun dad.\n\nYour mom is also a bit of an AH because she didn't talk to you about how hurt she would be if you didn't come. She can't say she's fine with something and then complain later that you didn't read her mind and realize she wanted you to be there.\n\nAs you are an adult, it's time to start doing some adulting. If there are relatives you don't want to visit, tell your mom, and explain why. But rather than sitting around doing nothing with your mom, why not find things to do with her. Don't depend on her to make the holidays fun, take her out to dinner, go to the park, or find things around that she would want to do. If she refuses to do anything, then you can tell her why you want to spend time doing other things, or going with your dad.", "YTA - you repeatedly choose money and fun things over the love of your mother, who most likely did 75% or more of the work in raising you.
