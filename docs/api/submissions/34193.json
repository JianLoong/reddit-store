So every opportunity I get, I join my dad and his gf on these vacations.\n\nFor the holidays this year, my father and his gf planned a trip to a place that I have always wanted to go to and that I knew I would enjoy a lot. When he told me about the trip initially, he did remind me that it was my mother's turn this year. But he did add that I was always welcome to come along if I wanted to.\n\nWhen I spend the holidays with my mother, it's usually very boring. We Just stay home and visit family members that I don't really enjoy being around. My mother and I don't even spend more time together than usual. So I decided to join my dad on his trip. When I told this to my mother she seemed fine with it so I didn't really see a problem.\n\nI returned from the trip a day before new year's and it was amazing. But when I went back home my mom seemed to be very cold towards me. Even during our new year's celebrations she seemed mad at me. I asked her if there was anything wrong and all of a sudden she burst out of anger. She started telling me that me not spending the holidays with her was extremely disrespectful.

Especially this part:  \"When he told me about the trip initially, he did remind me that it was my mother's turn this year.

Couldn\u2019t he have planned the trip for over new years? \nMeanwhile, your mom agreed to you going, and has punished you for it after the fact. Instead of bringing it up directly, she withheld affection. That\u2019s classic passive aggressive and it\u2019s not how a parent should treat anyone, and she\u2019s manipulating you in your emerging adult years. \nExpect both of those patterns to continue, and figure out how you want to establish yourself as an adult child of these two.", "NTA - now that you are an adult- you get to dictate how you spend your time.

I have pissed mine off with holiday plans before.

Visit her. Try to make it fun but yeah visit.  \n\nDealing with family expectations is one of those wonderful adult things nobody really expects to happen and then blamo it does.  \n\nAlso- setting a boundary that if someone is going to feel disrespected - to talk about that when the decision can be made not after.

(Although honestly I don't know for sure if she was actually as \"fine\" with you going as you say - unreliable narrators and all.) You're an adult - albeit still very young - and she is not entitled to time with you over the holidays. It is not \"disrespectful\" of you to not celebrate Christmas with her. She has every right to be sad or hurt, but to call you disrespectful makes her an asshole. \n\nAnd dude, of course you're an asshole. You chose a fun trip over seeing your mother for Christmas. You had no consideration for her feelings, no thought to how your extended family might feel about your absence- all you cared about was pleasing yourself.

Any good parent would be happy for their grown child after returning from an amazing trip.  Instead, your mom blew up at you as if everything was all about her. It's no wonder you didn't want to kill your holiday spirit by wanting to hang out with her. I honestly think she's reaping what she's sowing here.

You no longer have to be passed between parents like a child. It's fine for your mother to be disappointed, but the time to discuss that would have been before your trip.  She needs to get used to the fact that your life will no longer be dictated by her schedule.", "NTA.  Well I can see why there were issues between her and your dad. Apparently your Mum has a hard time speaking her mind and telling those around her what she feels. You're not a mind reader. You spoke with her about the situation and instead of telling you how she actually felt, she lied and said what you wanted to hear. I suspect she did the same thing to your dad all the time too.
