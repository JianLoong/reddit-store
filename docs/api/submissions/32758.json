Twins(M and F 14) and a boy (12).\nThe problem is between my boys Noah(twin), Liam and their mother. \n\nLiam always felt that his mom favors Noah over him. To get it straight out of the way: She loves him but he is still right. To make it simple I would say Liam gets 60% and Noah gets 100% of all love and affection their mother is able to give. His mother swears that it\u2019s not the case but it\u2019s obvious to everyone else, including our girl. I am trying my best to make things even without punishing Noah for something he has no control over. \n\nLiam's relationship with his mother and Noah has collapsed in the last year. He only speaks to them when it\u2019s necessary and he strictly addresses his mom with her first name. He avoids them and flees from them and when his mom or Noah try to talk to him or do something friendly from him, he berates them until they give up. \n\nYesterday we celebrated my wife\u2019s birthday with close friends and family. Liam stayed in his room although his mother slipped him a handwritten invitation under the door. When it came to opening the gifts we discovered to our surprise that Liam\u2019s name was on one of them. My wife was super exited and grabbed this one first.It was a disgusting collage with family pictures. Liam was always cut out and my wife had devil horns and insults written on her head. She bursted out in tears immediately and ran out of the room. Everybody saw this collage. The party was over of course and my wife was publicly humiliated in her own home on her birthday. \n\nLiam refuses to come out of his room and I decided to let him be for the moment but his mother demands that I ground him for a month with no electronics. I refused to do so and told her that if I punish him now for her he will resent her even more and their relationship may be unfixable. She called me an AH and an enabler. She doesn\u2019t care about reconciling with her son, she wants revenge. \n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: she didn\u2019t say she wants revenge, she said he should be punished for what he did. With revenge I meant that I think she wants him punished and does not think about the consequences. \n\nEdit 2: Had a quick talk with my wife. She wants therapy too. But only for her and Liam. She says there is nothing wrong with the other kids.

He's only capable of blaming his wife and I'm fairly confident saying his wife does the same from the other side. ESH", "ESH but Liam (and the other two kids).\n\nI also find this amazing because Liam is only 12.  It must be pretty big favoritism because a kid this young normally doesn't respond this strongly unless it's really bad stuff or there could be something underlying his thoughts (ND or behavioural stuff where he's very black and white).  Mostly the younger kids tend to keep trying and they just want their parents love and they forgive a lot... it often changes when they hit puberty.\n\nHave you even considered therapy for Liam... he's not been involved in the family for what sounds like months now and that's a massive thing for a kid his age.  I actually think you all need therapy and especially his mother.  There's a reason that she's like this and she should get to the bottom of it.  It may be as dark as he reminds her of the family member that may have done bad things to her as a kid and it's now a repressed memory coming out as a dislike for her child.. or was Noah sicker as a newborn.  Did your wife have PND when Liam was born and it was never addressed?  Did she resent getting pregnant with him as it was unexpected?  So many reasons it could be.  She may not realise she's doing it or doesn't think it's a problem and may need a professional to tell her how big an issue it is.\n\nYou also say that Noah is a clear favorite over his twin as well as Liam.  Does your wife have siblings and did her parents have a favorite too?  Where's this coming from?\n\nSometimes it's a perception that someone is less liked... but in your case, you're clear that it's obvious and everyone can see it.  Can you not see how big a problem this is?  And that you have not helped over the year and the preceeding years.\n\nThe relationship between Liam and his mother may never recover.  But it may be able to be helped.  Liam doesn't have to forget what she has been like and he may never trust her again even if he does forgive her.  His relationship with you has also been affected and may also not recover back to what it was before he realised what was going on.\n\nYou are right with not punishing him.  I would not call that a disgusting gift either.  It may be embarrassing but for a good reason.  Your wife should use this as a wake up call and try and fix her relationship with him.  Your wife should be getting some therapy and Liam needs help too.", "In regards to that punishment, you're right, it would just make their relationship worse. Behaviour is communication and he chose a way to tell her how he feels. He's 12 so of course it wasn't in a particularly appropriate way, but punishing him like that will make him feel like he's being punished for expressing his feelings.\n\nOverall this is all much bigger than that one situation and you all likely need family therapy. Your youngest son feels that he's valued less, and regardless of if it's true or accurate, it needs to be addressed properly. Your wife can brush it off and deny it as much as possible but that does nothing, Liam needs someone to actually listen to him and how he feels.\n\nIdk how to make a judgement on here outside of, NTA for not punishing your kid, but maybe ESH for letting it get to this point.", "This is on you as well.

Yes, I do engage in what the other kid is interested in as well, and they know that I appreciate their interests even if I don\u2019t always share them.

Worst of all, is she was the unloved child growing up so she knew firsthand how painful it was.", "This might be the case of compound interest. That is, one boy gets treated slightly worse and notices it, or maybe it's just a perception of unfair treatment. Naturally, he acts out or is just a bit less responsive to mom's warmth. Mom gets that warmth from the other body and naturally gives more attention. Eventually it escalates to the point where one of her kids is the sweetest gift and another is a prick.

Human interaction is not a video game where you get through the completion requirements to win lol. Human interaction is built off of incredibly subtle communication and interpretation.

When mom is engaged with Noah she is present and focused and he has her attention. When she is engaged with Liam she is not as present or focused and he lacks her complete attention. \n\nThis was the kind of emotional neglect my husband\u2019s siblings got from their father - he would engage, but not be present. With my husband he was present, but overly strict and critical. \n\nFIL was on the Spectrum and undiagnosed. He understood that he had to engage with all his kids, but was incapable of masking well enough to effectively feign interest in topics and people he found uninteresting. It wasn\u2019t even that he necessarily loved the others less - they just weren\u2019t interesting to him the way my husband was and he was incapable of obscuring his feelings on the matter. \n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s a similar issue here.", "It might be equal to you but your kids might feel differently.

OP mentions their daughter has noticed, and I'm now wondering if he asked her. And if so, how much he is making things worse by talking to kids about this and giving them his views of it. My own dad is guilty of this, he brings his issues with my mom to myself and my siblings and, while neither of them are perfect, he's successfully made the relationship with my siblings and mom extremely difficult.  The only reason I see it now, is there was an instance where he did something that *shocked* me into realizing what he was doing.", "The language you use tells me that you are part of the problem. \n\nI have a lot of kids. They are all completely different. So much so teachers couldn't believe they were siblings. \n\nI've got a \"spirited\" child who will verbally rip your throat out if you say anything about their siblings. I've got one who is next level intelligent  and one who has to work very hard to get those top results. I've got one who will cry if you say you're disappointed and another who will take all you've got on the punishment response because they've already factored it in and decided it was worth it. I've got a risk taker and I've got a happy hermit unless prompted to socialise. I have a chronic comic that doesn't mean to be funny and a super serious child who thinks they live in a family of nutters. \n\nReally different kids. \n\nI am a single parent. At various times each child gets varying amounts of attention. They all say the youngest gets too much leeway. So dynamics are fluid. I get the nature of that. \n\nThe point is if I tracked one kid I could make a good case for favouritism or holding the shit end of the stick just by giving it that focus. \n\nAll of the things you've mentioned are viewed through a particular lens. And all of the things that would counter that view, pretty readily I would say, are being down played. The length of hugs???? Seriously???? They are both getting them. \n\nYou're contributing to the problem. Why, I don't know. But there'll be a reason. Where are you in birth order or what are your parenting examples? Because you can't see your role in this. \n\nLetting this stunt go unpunished, or even considering that to the point you want feedback, is only going to contribute to that. How you don't see it is pretty crazy. \n\nI think it needs professionals tbh, not a winner in a disagreement. YTA for fuelling the issue by not responding immediately to disrespect and cruelty that took planning, time and effort and was done for an audience. You are going to have bigger issues with that kid going forward. He is victimising your wife and you are giving it legitimacy. Adulthood is going to be a lot more serious if you don't get external assistance imo.  \n\nYou are the same-sex role model to that kid. YOU have the influence to make an impact. \n\nOne thing about my kids is they ALL know ALL of the time is they are loved. Equally but sometimes differently. The first kid was fussed over and the last one was more free range. That's parenthood. But they don't doubt the love.", "You say \"we\" and it makes me wonder how much you've had to do with this issue.", "Sir. YOU don\u2019t get decided who loves whom more. You can say you see favoritism- but no one can speak to how much love others have for certain people. \n\nYOU are a large part of this problem. Why was therapy not involved long ago? Why are you not teaching Liam that his behavior is not helpful to his own heart and character? \n\nWhy do you think you get to judge everyone involved?", "I think this episode makes it highly likely that whatever is going on rises to the level of emotional abuse. BOTH PARENTS are responsible. I have seen too many situations where one parent sits back and watches everything go on, but does nothing to protect the child is being abused. \n\nRight now Liam is mad at his mom and thinks of you as the \u201cgood\u201d parent. But that isn\u2019t going to last forever if nothing changes. \n\nYou need to get the WHOLE family in therapy NOW.", "Who are \u201cwe\u201d? It\u2019s just the kids and you? Or are people from outside the family than can see this, too?", "You can't say who she loves more. Love is shown in different ways. I love my kids equally, but they're very different people and I show my affection for them in different ways because they both prefer different things. You don't have a firm concept of parental love if you think the gift would change her feelings toward him, either. You can love a kid just the same, but be hurt by them, scared of them, and so forth. It sounds to me like your kid needed some reassurance years ago, and instead you probably stoked the fires so to speak, and encouraged the idea that she obviously is different with him. So it built up into more and he acted out and so she didn't know how to handle him. How do you show a child pure love in the same way when instead of believing or accepting it, they make devil horns on you and want your other child removed from their life? \n\nIt's kind of on kids too, as much as people hate to say it. Some kids pull away from hugs quickly, some lean into them and want more. Kids need different things. If I had to guess, Liam just prefers a different form of showing love, and you or your wife aren't aware of it. I'd also guess that your actions, including telling the kid that you see it too and not punishing or at least constructively approaching the topic of the gift, are partly responsible for pushing him to this point. \n\nIf not, my next guesses are that you're a child writing this to get some feedback about how you think your family treats you differently (you're basically the Liam) or this is fake altogether (which is most common here).\n\nAlso, grounding or similar forms of punishment aren't revenge. The kid's feelings are probably valid, but the actions were not. How does your wife feel about you controlling her and her relationship with the kids? Seen as how she is apparently unable to ground or punish the kids, and you unilaterally decide what she feels, what she wants, and what's ok for the kids... Yeah if this is real you're an idiot with a lot to work through.", "This has been escalating for years- time is not an excuse here.", "They should've been in therapy years ago", "A responsive mother would notice this, and adjust to meet each kid's particular needs. That hasn't happened.", "Seriously? OP makes it very clear that she openly and outwardly favors the brother, which is a massive failure as a parent - this favoritism has so deeply hurt Liam to the point that he acted out and made the collage/scene.

Parents have to LOVE all kids equally, that doesn\u2019t mean they have to like them equally or have the same relationship with all of them.  Fathers often bond more with sons, moms bond more with daughters, some kids naturally align more with one parent or another.

If my mum needs a distraction / to relax then she will reach out to my brother, but if she needs help making a decision, or advice, or even just someone to rant about her work to, she comes to me. \n\nThat doesn't mean the relationships are any less loving. but it can help mask any differences, or at least allow yourself to pretend. If nothing else, society teaches us to expect our parents to treat us differently based on gender. \n\nGet two siblings that are the same gender, and within a couple years of age and any difference in treatment stands out more. This becomes even more noticeable if they share even just a couple interests or when one of them starts acting out. \n\nIt is also possible that the daughter does feel the same but is internalizing it rather than expressing it.

I always find it especially fascinating when someone is already known to be an asshole, things they do that are way worse get a lot tamer reactions, whereas someone who is trying to be \"good\" /is usually perceived as \"good\"/ has a reputation to be lost will be scrutinized to no end (especially parents).\n\nOne example: My sis has been diagnosed with antisocial persoanlity disorder and she's made all our lives hell ever since I can remember. She blames it all on things she sees as traumatic in our upbringing that I personally see as \"meh, our parents tried but weren't perfect\", and in our case she was the \"wanted\" child who got all the attention, me the accident that was just there.

You notice the little things so much more when there\u2019s more than one of you, you see the others being favoured. You see yourself being forgotten. It really damages kids.
