Whether you like it or not, that teacher is one of the authorities at that school.

That would be ridiculous. Any event that allows parents and other supporters to attend must provide bathrooms for their use.  At any given time, there will be parents in the building for various reasons. If the school wants to limit which bathrooms can be in use, they lock the firewall doors or close metal gates or put up signs and cordon off areas.  Volunteers in the building can be told which bathrooms to use. It is reasonable that the closest bathroom to the gym would be the default bathroom for the public during the event.

You can give them the \u201cwin\u201d even if you know they are wrong.  You can choose to not escalate a situation unnecessarily. Rolling your eyes and getting snarky is disrespectful.  People like you are one of the reasons why teachers are leaving the profession in droves, me included.

At my wife's school, every event has people assigned to different tasks - including dealing with parents. Heck, parents are often the worst. And if they don't enforce \"bad\" policy (which often comes from something bad that happened previously - ask me about parents doing drugs on school grounds or getting in fights with students at a volleyball game), the teacher can be disciplined.  \n\n\nSo he should ask the school administrator.

I can't trust grown men around my precious baby boy!\"* (To which my thought was, \"Yeah, and wouldn't trust a boy in the throes of puberty in the ladies' room.\") I just - gave up at that point, her opinions were set so firmly in concrete that I'd have needed a kilo of C-4 to blast them loose.\n\nThis same mother accused me of \"trying to get (my) daughter SA'ed\" because I allowed her to go to the single-person restroom at the local diner by herself at the age of 5 - when I could see from my seat to the restroom door.\n\nPoint being, it's not so much that the kid can't go to the bathroom alone, it's that the parent is too scared of who else might be in the bathroom with their kid to let them go alone. I do think OP is YTA, but I do know that this is the sort of mindset some parents have and I think it's sad.

Like they would send students who were moving between classes aside and give them office referrals for having their shirt untucked (mind you, this was a public school in a semi-rural small town.)\n\nOne day one of these teachers who would make a habit of trying to publicly shame dress code violations asked my buddy to stand up in class, as she noticed that his pants did not meet the dress code standards. They were the right color and material, but had an elastic waistband, not beltloops, or something equally trivial. She told him to stand up, and come to the front of the class. \"Now explain to the class why you think that the rules that everybody else has to follow don't apply to you!\"\n\nHe looked at her, obviously feeling hurt and embarrassed, and answered her truthfully. \"I'm sorry ma'am, my house burnt down last night, and this was all I could come up with.\" The look on this bitter old lady's face was priceless.\n\nMy buddy was good within the week, his house had a dryer fire that destroyed the laundry room, and spread to the kitchen, second floor had a lot of smoke damage.

Some are very confident and independent, some are nervous about new spaces and feel very uncomfortable being alone in a public restroom without their parent at least in earshot. Some have special needs and may require assistance in the bathroom. Point is, you don't know. A father should be able to take his son into a boys bathroom. That isn't weird at all.", "Nope.  Not OK.  Kid is 7, he can pee in the student bathrooms on his own.  Dad needs to wait outside.  It's a safety thing.", "This is an insane take.", "A parent cant take their child to the bathroom????

At 7, kids probably don't want their parents in the stall with them.", "Yes. It's always good to be aware that not everyone lives and thinks the way we do.", "It didn't to me", "So, in order for OP and 7yo to even be at the rally it was open at least to parents and siblings.

If they weren't allowed to be at the event or snuck in or something then they definitely weren't. If they're in a sports focused area like where I am in Texas then a homecoming rally would likely be open to the public. I think they sold tickets or something for my high school. And considering the teacher didn't have an issue that they were there, I imagine that's the case. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy guess is it was a semi-public event and OP overlooked a more accessible intended public bathroom or the teacher only knew outside people weren't supposed to use the student bathrooms and wasn't aware of any exceptions.

The other option was the staff one but they tended to be attached to a private staff area or require a key, so completely inaccessible to non-staff.", "No, it sounds like they are telling the adult they can't be in there for the very reason the adult was not sending their kid in alone. A non employee adult who walked in while a student was there is a major risk for the school.\n\nThe school my mum works at always designates a bathroom for visitors for events, it always has a lineup and parents always try to use the student only ones - and someone's parent always complains about the 'weird adult looking at their kid'", "They weren't supposed to use THAT restroom. It wasn't the younger child's school event. They were there during the high schooler's event. They needed to find restrooms not intended for students.

I'd imagine the purpose is mostly accomplished by simply isolating where people can be when you do these kinds of events. Have easy bathrooms wherever you'd expect spectators to be and just put up signs or like rope ways to gently herd people into acceptable areas.
