You definitely have a reason to be biased in your retelling of this, and the fact that you're omitting the specific type of bigot you were accused of being only raises suspicion that you're not being entirely truthful. I think I can _guess_ what you were accused of being, but the fact you won't just outright say it makes it look like you have something to hide.\n\nBigot or not though, if somebody actively tries to make your life hell, they shouldn't expect help from someone they have scorned. Maybe you are an asshole, but it would not be from denying your former friend help. That bridge is burned.\n\nAnd even then, cancelling someone is something that is only useful on a large scale. Celebrities and people with big followings should be cancelled when they do bad things, because if we don't cancel them, their hateful influence spreads. But on an individual scale, it's counter productive. You were a nobody at the time. You didn't have a large following to influence. If you _did_ do something wrong, then your friends who are not part of the minority group should've remained civil, because all they did with their actions was push you in the wrong direction.
