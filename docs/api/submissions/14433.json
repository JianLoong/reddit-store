You definitely have a reason to be biased in your retelling of this, and the fact that you're omitting the specific type of bigot you were accused of being only raises suspicion that you're not being entirely truthful. I think I can _guess_ what you were accused of being, but the fact you won't just outright say it makes it look like you have something to hide.\n\nBigot or not though, if somebody actively tries to make your life hell, they shouldn't expect help from someone they have scorned. Maybe you are an asshole, but it would not be from denying your former friend help. That bridge is burned.\n\nAnd even then, cancelling someone is something that is only useful on a large scale. Celebrities and people with big followings should be cancelled when they do bad things, because if we don't cancel them, their hateful influence spreads. But on an individual scale, it's counter productive. You were a nobody at the time. You didn't have a large following to influence. If you _did_ do something wrong, then your friends who are not part of the minority group should've remained civil, because all they did with their actions was push you in the wrong direction.

Putting you in this man\u2019s crosshairs again.\n\nShe\u2019s reaching out to you because you saw through Piper\u2019s BS, and she knows you won\u2019t turn her over to him or work with him.\n\nSome cash, direct her to a place to stay, but don\u2019t expose yourself to risk. She\u2019s attacked you once already.", "He does not help her, let her rot with her abuser, they deserve each other, she is a traitor and does not deserve compassion, YWBNTA", "Nta and do not respond. She'll just use the refusal to help as new fuel to burn u down", "nta-she made the bed she lays in.  Block and ignore her", "Her life is karma at work.  Dont interfere.", "YWNBTA. Your relationship with your former BFF ended for a very good reason. People calling you a Nazi is very damaging. You had to create under pen names. \n\nYou need to protect yourself and your career from them. There are other options available to her, like a women's shelter for women who go through any kind of abuse.\n\nYou owe her nothing financially. You left a creative that you helped start and fund. Don't even respond to the email. It is not worth your time or energy.", "NTA. Do not reply. She will only destroy your life all over again. It hurts that she used to be a friend, but that bridge was fully burnt by her", "NTA. Not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nAll I heard was what *she* needed, not an apology for what she did.", "I say NTA.  She made her bed, now she has to lie in it.  Sucks to be her for sure, but actions have consequences.  She hadn't bothered to try and reach out or mend fences until she needed something, that in itself speaks volumes to me. I understand being torn, but I wouldn't reach out if it were me.", "NTA. Donate to a DV shelter and direct her that way. You can't afford to have her in your life again. \n\nEven if she admits to what she did and apologized, you still don't have to have her anywhere near your current life. She might still lash out, all the more reason to keep your distance.", "Nope NTA. Do you really want to let the rats in that happily followed the pied piper? Don\u2019t let the plague back in.", "NTA & do NOT let yourself get sucked back in!! \u201cWow, sorry you are going through that. I am not in a position to help you right now. I\u2019ve learned that when you only have yourself to rely on it makes you a stronger person, good luck.\u201d", "NTA. You can only rely on previous experience when it comes to decision making, and you described your past experience with BFF as feeling \"like a car accident\". If I were in your shoes I wouldn't be willing to risk my reputation/career again. \n\nI wonder if you feel the way you do because you both have a history of being great friend before Pied Piper came along? I think I would also be torn, the answer obvious but it's also uncomfortable. You once had a strong friendship and now she's in a bad situation, that's going to make anyone feel a certian kinda way. However, none of that negates her actions and the devastating effect they had on your life.", "Tell me, in the x amount of time since you cut ties has BFF tried to make amends? I wager the answer is *nope*.\n\nBFF used her proximity to you back then in order to destroy you and is now relying on that same familiarity to pull at heart strings?\n\n\nBlock the email address.\n\nDelete the email.\n\nEmpty the recycling bin.\n\nNTA.", "Beware! She & her BF could be trying to cancel you further! Rope you in & steal your life again. When someone shows you who they are. Believe them the 1st time!!!", "NTA. you help out friends. she isn't a friend. You tried to warn her long ago. She went out of her way to destroy you and yours and now finds out you were right.  You have no responsibility to help her out of the karma she fell into.", "NTA.  But don't tell her \"No.\"  Don't tell her ANYTHING.  Absolutely anything you send to her can be screenshotted and posted elsewhere, given whatever context she wants to give it, and used to start a new round of attacks on you if you don't do what she wants.  So don't reply at all, don't even acknowledge that you got her email.  She should never even know that you read it.", "NTA.  Send her links to women\u2019s shelters and tell her if he is violent to call 911.  Then wish her the best and block her number", "If you want you could help her get in touch with the appropriate organisations.  But keep a record of everything you do involving her.", "If some random person emailed you asking for money with a sob story, you\u2019d assume it is a scam. For all intents and purposes, your former BFF is a stranger, a random person who you have no connection to and don\u2019t associate with.\n\nDelete the email. Delete it from the trash bin. As far as you\u2019re concerned, you never got it and it never existed.\n\nIf you respond with a \u201cno,\u201d there is a solid chance she\u2019ll show it to everyone and try to rake you through the coals again. So delete it and forget you ever saw it.\n\nThen move on with your life secure in knowing it\u2019s not your problem. This former BFF is just a stranger to you now, and like I said; you wouldn\u2019t send money to a stranger who randomly emailed you.\n\nNTA", "\u201cNot my circus, not my monkeys\u201d?\n\nThis. NTA", "Nta and your a racist apparently, why would she turn to a racist for help?", "I can't imagine the gull to ask someone whose life you ruined for help.\n\nIn this case, even if OP wanted to help, it'd be a very bad idea. You don't set yourself on fire to keep warm. If you want to be nice, fork over a couple bucks and a local woman's shelter info. But even that isn't required.\n\nFormer BFF did not reach out because she was sorry or changed her ways. She reached out because she wanted money. She knew she was involved with a predator when dude destroyed your life. She's only unhappy when it got aimed at her. That is still how much you mean to her. \n\n\"Please don't contact me again\" or just not answering at all is probably the smart answer.", "You are NTA if you were to not invite your friend into your house for shelter. Let's say like this you don't know your friend that well after years of cutting ties and she showed her true face by deliberately hurting you, kicking you out of the group and attacking your parents out of the blue to get to you. \n\nYou don't owe your best friend anything anymore all you can do is just send her a few hundreds or thousands of dollars to help with her upkeep but you do not owe her any shelter or anything like that she cut ties and went with a guy that basically used her and abused her verbally and emotionally. \n\nSo I just say that live your life help out with money don't do it often and just pray that she changes for the better knowing what she has found out. I hope this helps", "Feels like a trap though don't it? Might have figured that OP is living a good stable life and PP might have put a notion in the BFF's head to continue to mess with OP.", "She\u2019s a viper. I know people like her. STAY AWAY OP.\n\nSeriously op is really smart for sticking with pen names.", "right, why is she asking you for help? where are all the other members of that crew?", "Ah, you must be from Tennessee. Or Texas ... but probably Tennessee.", "Right?\nAnd this - \n\n> it changed the entire tone of the media we were looking to release and alienate researched and targeted markets -- they all turned on me. Any criticism was now seen as hate toward the Pied Piper's discriminated-against group.\n\nHow did this all go down? What were the changes and how did it come that OP was painted as a bigot? This is all a bit muddy. If they were writing nazi fiction targeted at incels and the project changed to be more inclusionary and OP didn't want to be inclusionary in any way and didn't want to lose a racist audience, this is a whole other tale... \n\nNote: I am obviously using an extreme as an example", "With that last point, i believe it may also be her saying \"you were right i believe you now and everything can be forgiven and you can help me even though i almost ruined your life\"", "Interestingly enough 'canceling' in the colloquial understanding only seems to 'work' on a certain size. \n\nOnision is the only one I can name off the top of my head who's been shunned almost completely as of late and there's a huge amount of the internet who's never heard of him.\n\nSomeone with a smaller following can typically rebuild with a rebranding while larger ones like Kanye or certain comedians will always have die hard fans who'll help them bounce back after a time.", "To be fair, OP has also been a victim of the Piper and saw through his shit. She may see OP as the only person who won\u2019t tell the Piper she\u2019s trying to leave, and who will believe her story.\n\nShe is sorry, and OP is the only person she feels she can trust. We don\u2019t have to assume malice.\n\nEdit: dear Christ I saw OP\u2019s comment about what\u2019s in the letter. I take it back, she\u2019s malicious as hell.", ">email...then ignore it don't say a thing and please change your email\n\nNo need that email account was forwarded to OPs new one, as long as their was no \"read\" notification sent back then XBFF won't even know if it hot to OP in the first place if OP doesn't reply.\n\nOP, NTA. Don't reply, don't reach out in anyway. As far as she is concerned, you died when she cut you off in such a disgusting way. Keep your new life safe and don't look back.", "nta..I\u2019m glad you overcame and achieved your dreams. Don\u2019t invite nightmares to share that space.\n\nBest of luck with your glorious life. They do say it\u2019s the best revenge", "She doesn\u2019t owe her anything. Sending any amount of funds is probably not going to be beneficial to OP. Hundred or thousands of dollars to an ex friend who tried to ruin OP\u2019s life?!?! Strange for her to do that, she\u2019d only be furthering this toxic situation! It\u2019s better she stays clear!", "You're pretty good with pen names too! \"The Viper and The Piper\" has a really nice ring to it lol", "She is a Black Hole, don't get pulled in, she would destroy you.", "So, that tells you something really important. She isn't sorry and likely doesn't see what she did as wrong. That means when the guy love bombs her and she decides to get back with him, she won't waste even a second before doing it all over again.\n\nNow, I can't say what is best for your personal healing and emotions. However, you have two employees who you are responsible for. Do not send her a single bloody cent. Send her links to any women's shelters that are local to her and suggest she see a therapist, but you can't let her get into a position where she can harm you or those working for you.", "Especially in that case, don\u2019t just ignore the message. Tell her that you CAN believe it because you warned her who he was from the beginning and she torpedoed your life for it. So respectfully, she has to deal with the monster she fed.", "It seems she's the same person who went out of her way to hurt you. Just delete the email and move on. You have a lotvto lose, and she only seems in the mood to take. \n\nThere are resources for her, you don't have to  be one of them.", "Jesus stay away from that like a ten foot pole. I thought it was a sincere cry for help, but this is unhinged.", "Send her Links to shelters if you're so inclined and inform her the friendship ended years ago and not on a good note either. Nta", "Maybe it's a scam and they are trying to locate you. Please just block her email entirely and invest in a VPN masking service. Please also scan your machine.  If the email had any links/images, they may be trying to phish info from your connection.  Block all her numbers.  Please consider changing your phone settings to send any calls not in your contacts straight to voicemail.\n\nFYI, there are antivirus apps and VPN masking apps also available for your phones as well as your computer.\n\nEdit:   NTA!", "If the tone was odd, I'd consider it bait for a trap. Maybe she's lying. Maybe HE is using her email to try and get to you. \n\nIt's not unusual for abused people to be alienated, and shelters are prepared to help people in that situation.  Don't respond.", "I had a girl do this crap to me in 2013 at the peak of the crazy Tumblr style \"social justice\". It was literally her blaming me that her friend wasn't fucking my (now) fiance but it was because he and I were racist for being in an interracial relationship. It was just flat out white supremacist incel \"interracial couples are bad\" shit being painted with a veneer of \"activist\" language. \n\nLike two years ago she tried to get in touch with me through a friend of a friend of hers who was staying at my fiance and I's apartment and she had the same group of people turn on her. No apologies no nothing....just \"I was soooo mentally ill and didn't know what I was doing\". \n\nToo bad, so sad.", "I mean it definitely seems to have worked on Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and John Kricfalusi. They weren't completely destroyed, they still have money and will lead a decent life, but they've been effectively blacklisted in their respective industries and will likely never find high-profile work again. That's the goal of cancelling and it's worked quite a few times.", "Bot? I think this is a partially copied comment from u/Shmokeahontis.", "\u201cDeal with the monster you fed.\u201d That is incredible and I am stealing it.", ">I'm just saying it's hard to judge whether OP actually is a bigot or not when they're withholding a central piece of information of their story.\n\nHow so? Is there a specific minority group where, \"Sorry, but we've already done the market research and shouldn't completely change what we're doing at the last minute,\" becomes bigoted?", "Is it weird that I totally forgot about Weinstein? After he was convicted and incarcerated I happily burnt his existence out of my mind.\n\nNever heard of Kricfalusi but looks like your right in that. Scott Adams looks to be on the same path.\n\nI think the argument COULD be made that it wasn't quite the societal canceling that put the nail in the coffin of your two examples careers rather that they were already fading into irrelevancy. \n\nIf they were at the height of their popularity/cultural power, it's conceivable that they'd be able to ride out the bad press.", "Correct. I remember typing that.", "Yes. \"Anonymous\" just means that your info doesn't show publicly on the web. The GoFundMe creator gets your Name, Address, E-mail address, and Donation Amount. (I know this because I've done a couple of GFMs for other people/things.)", "No, I don't think there is, if that's all that OP said and if they really just said it word for word like that. But if OP is going to hide what she was accused of, who's to say she's not hiding anything else to bias our judgement?\n\nCall me paranoid if you must, but I just don't see why she would hide what she was accused of unless she actually has something to hide. I'd be more inclined to side with her entirely if she'd just said \"I was falsely accused of being racist/homophobic/transphobic/whatever\" instead of dancing around the issue.", "Hmm, that may be the case? I didn't realize Weinstein or Cosby were at the end of their relevancy at the time. It's hard to tell with some folks tho. People like Weinstein or Lasseter of Pixar are more behind-the-scenes folks and I'm not sure if they were past their prime.\n\nI guess you do have a point though. Trump, Musk and Rowling are currently still riding out constant bad press and doing fine despite it. Although that may change with Trump and Rowling since they too are reaching the end of their relevance. And like you said, Kanye probably wouldn't struggle much either, although I'm a bad judge of that since I'm not super involved in the hip-hop scene. It's mostly the film and animation industry that I keep up to date in.", "oh goddamnit", "I'd imagine that the Roiland controversy will be a good indicator in your area of expertise on if someone at the height of their relevancy can be 'canceled'.", "That's a good point. I'd forgotten that Roiland got cancelled. Well, we'll see how that develops. I know he got kicked of Rick and Morty but we'll see if he makes it back into the industry in a few years.\n\nThere have been similar cases tho. Chris Savino from Nickelodeon's \"The Loud House\" got booted off his own show a few years ago and nobody's heard from him since.\n\nBut pretty much all of those cases involved crimes and sexual harassment. Butch Hartman, creator of Fairly Oddparents, survived his cancelling because even tho he's a fundamentalist Christian creationist who made fun of a suicide victim, at least never committed a serious crime."]}
