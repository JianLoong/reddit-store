NTA. \n\n**IF** she really was responsible for the attack on you in the past, it's your responsibility to yourself to stay away from her in the present. \n\nFlying monkeys have to face the responsibilities of their actions just like the rest of us.", "Do not - and I cannot stress this enough - do not set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. \n\nYou have a kind heart but look what happened last time. You\u2019ve finally rebuilt your life and you\u2019re going to let his wrecking ball back in? Na. Delete the email so you\u2019re not tempted to reply and carry on with your life. She will have other friends/family she can reach out to. This is not your responsibility. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Stay away. Don\u2019t let her pull you back in. She could ruin everything. Let her find another person to help her. She\u2019s not even a good person and doesn\u2019t deserve your empathy or help. She can and possibly will turn on you in an instant if given the chance. Protect your sanity and your career.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s become incredibly stylish in recent years to burn down friendships over minor viewpoint differences. People who do so often sacrifice valuable friends for participation points in the cause of the day. Sounds like your group was an early adopter of that movement. \n\nAt best she was a terrible friend, at worst she was deliberately trying to sabotage your life. You deserve to protect the insulation that you\u2019ve built from people like her. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to direct her to other resources that might help, shelters and such. But your emotional well-being isn\u2019t worth giving up for someone who clearly wounded you. \n\nIf you think you\u2019re better off without letting her back into your life, protect that.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m glad you overcame and achieved your dreams. Don\u2019t invite nightmares to share that space. \n\nBest of luck with your glorious life. They do say it\u2019s the best revenge.", "Nope, don't respond.  You can't possibly be the only person on earth who can help this woman.  Family, more recent friends, religious community, battered women's shelter, police, you name it:  but not you.  This woman sabotaged your life and tried to destroy your family' business.  You cannot trust her.  Repeat:  You cannot trust her!!!!  I would recommend that you not engage.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm very glad to hear that your career is thriving, but with your need for privacy to the point that you won't even let your publisher use an author photo and you're writing under different names and genders, it's clear that the damage this woman did years ago has very ugly tentacles that reach into the present.\n\nStay away.  Far far away.  Not a word.  Not a dime.  Not a thought.\n\nNTA", "NTA don't risk it.", "INFO: Did she in any way apologise for her past behaviour?", "NTA, don't seek trouble. She hurt you big time, you owe her nothing. As you said, not your circus...", "NTA. and its completely understandable that you're twisted up in this situation. She was your BFF and you care for her and you want to help, but don't forget she was willing to threaten you and your families careers and livelihoods for her own personal wants and endeavors. Your circus seems like its doing very well. She can figure hers out just as you did yours.", "NTA if you feel like being kind then send her the names of local shelters that help abused women etc. don\u2019t get sucked in. If she still wants contact when she has sorted herself out then that\u2019s a whole new story.", "NTA\n\nThere are, quite literally, billions of other people she hasn't personally fucked over. There is plenty of help out there. \n\nI might have some caveats if you indicated there was a physical risk, but it sounds like you can let her figure this out without you.\n\nAnd block her.", "NTA...send her a phone number of a woman's shelter. That's good enough.", "NTA and don't help her. She was fine with the groups (and by that, including her) attempt to destroy your life and now when she has got no one else to seek comfort she's crawling back. She made her bed, now she can lie in it.", "NTA. Ignore the message, don't answer it. Doing so would mean opening that can of worms again. She told you who she really was; believe her.", "NTA.  \n\n\nIf you're feeling guilty, maybe send her the addresses of some local woman's shelters where she can stay. But absolutely do not let her stay with you.", "INFO: What marginalized group is Pied Piper part of?\n\nI'm tending towards NTA, because the way you tell your story certainly makes it seem so, but I'm hesitant. You definitely have a reason to be biased in your retelling of this, and the fact that you're omitting the specific type of bigot you were accused of being only raises suspicion that you're not being entirely truthful. I think I can _guess_ what you were accused of being, but the fact you won't just outright say it makes it look like you have something to hide.\n\nBigot or not though, if somebody actively tries to make your life hell, they shouldn't expect help from someone they have scorned. Maybe you are an asshole, but it would not be from denying your former friend help. That bridge is burned.\n\nAnd even then, cancelling someone is something that is only useful on a large scale. Celebrities and people with big followings should be cancelled when they do bad things, because if we don't cancel them, their hateful influence spreads. But on an individual scale, it's counter productive. You were a nobody at the time. You didn't have a large following to influence. If you _did_ do something wrong, then your friends who are not part of the minority group should've remained civil, because all they did with their actions was push you in the wrong direction. So it's definitely either a NTA or ESH, but it's hard to say which.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
