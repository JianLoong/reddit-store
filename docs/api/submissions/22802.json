We own a 3 bedroom house with a good amount of land along with a guest house which we rent out.

A few days ago we were out for breakfast when my uncle (let\u2019s call mark) had mentioned something about my cousin (22M) (we\u2019ll call him Jake) getting the opportunity for a plumbing apprenticeship in the area and not having the money but needing a place to stay, mark suggested jake staying in the guest house, I reminded mark the guest house currently was being rented. Mark said I stop renting to the people who live there and let Jake stay instead but I explained I can\u2019t kick the couple who lives there out just so my cousin can live there rent free. That\u2019s when my aunt Sarah chimes in and suggests my brother shares a room with my son and Jake stays in Brother's old room.\nI told them I wasn\u2019t going to make my brother and son share a room just so my cousin who got kicked out of college could move in. They said this is apprenticeship is a good opportunity for Jake, I replied telling them if they want him to do the apprenticeship then they could pay for the first months rent for an apartment, after that he would be able to pay for it himself with the money he would earn from the apprenticeship, or he could sell his fancy new car I\u2019ve seen him posting and bragging about and use the money from that to pay rent. They told me I\u2019m being selfish and need grow up, after that i had, had enough and got up payed my part of the bill and left.\u00a0\nLater that day I got a text from my aunt saying how I behaved poorly and that after I left everyone agreed I was being selfish along with multiple other messages and missed calls telling me I need to grow up and accept that Jake will be moving in with me, my cousin also messaged and called me childish. I also got a message from my sister saying the rest of the family is on my side and Sarah and Mark were wrong for putting me in that position at breakfast and left shortly after I did. After that I sent the following message to my aunt, uncle and cousin \u201cwhile I understand you may be frustrated with me, my decision stands, I will not be letting Jake move in. I can\u2019t just evict the tenants living in the guest house.
