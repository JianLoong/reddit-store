{"id": 25349, "submission_id": "15z80sa", "title": "AITA for telling my neighbor enough is enough?", "selftext": "Our neighbor claims that we're making a lot of noise at all hours of the day. We've tried to be accommodating, but it\u2019s not working. \n\nThe first time the neighbor came to the door was in November 2022. My girlfriend was visiting family, and I was asleep. The neighbor arrived a bit before 12 o'clock, banging and ringing the doorbell intensely until I answered. He asked if it was us who were making so much noise, and we eventually figured that it must have been from the shared living space above us (6-8 students, small private rooms, sharing kitchen and living room), which had been awful the past year (so much in fact that I had to start taking heavy sleeping meds and using earplugs). \n\n\nThe next time he came was in July, on a Friday or Saturday evening. My gf was sitting on the couch, and I was on my PC. Again, he complained that there had been a lot of noise lately. \nHowever, we had been visiting family out of town the week before. \n\n\nNonetheless, I took the initiative to exchange Facebook so that he could PM us when he hears noise, and we could then see where we are or what we're doing at that time. \n\nEvery time messages have been sent, we have either been away at work/studies, or we have been sleeping. We go to bed around 10 PM since I work full time and my girlfriend works/studies. We received a message at 1 AM last week. Of course, I didn't respond to that until the morning. \n\n\nToday, my girlfriend got up and left just before 7 AM. We received a message from the neighbor shortly after, asking if we're slamming cabinets. I replied that my girlfriend had been to the bathroom. I also mentioned that it's an exaggeration to say that someone is slamming cabinets and that some noise should be expected when living in an apartment building. I must say that I'm starting to get a bit fed up with this. We\u2019re very quiet in the morning so as to not wake the other up. \n\n\nThe neighbor then came to the door, very angry and aggressive. He said he will send an email with audio recordings and video to our shared landlord, and also inform the next tenant about us, as they\u2019re moving in 2 months. He was clenching his fists and speaking through his teeth, looking like he wanted to brawl. I thought he came across almost threatening.\n\nI told him that enough is enough, that we\u2019ve disproven pretty much all the claims of us being noisy, but he\u2019s completely locked to the idea. I said \u201cwe\u2019re not getting anywhere with this\u201d, and ended the conversation there. \n\n\nThis is the first time we've received any complaints about making noise in our 5 years of living together in flats, and we believe we're using the space as can be expected. As mentioned, we're mostly away during the day, and evenings are mostly about cooking and going to bed early. We still hear the people living above us today, but not to the extent that it's disturbing us. \n\nMy girlfriend finds the whole situation uncomfortable and no longer wants to open the door if someone knocks, and afraid to meet him outside.\n\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m considering going no contact on him. As in, don\u2019t open the door if he\u2019s knocking, and not replying to his messages. Don\u2019t know if I should wait for the answer to the email I sent to my landlord first or not though. Definitely recording whatever happens from here.

Your neighbor is harassing you and now your GF is uncomfortable. I would make a complaint about it all.", "NTA\n\nHonestly this is a special blend of ignorance on his part.  So there's a shared living space nearby full of students and YOU are the first and only thought that comes to this guy's head?  This is like if you both lived next to a fire dept. station, and they come to you complaining about your sirens.  There's no fixing nor dealing with stupid on a level like this.\n\nHe doesn't even deserve to have the door opened to him anymore, and you're fully within your right to just ask for him to never come back.", "NTA  \nYou don't have to put up with this neighbor. You could complain to the landlord, especially since you have messages (screenshot those) showing a pattern of harassment.  Alternately you could randomly show up at his door and accuse him of disturbing you. You could claim they're noisy, accuse them of having foul odors coming from their place, say they have 29 cats, hookers in and out, or that they steal packages from your doorstep. He's making it up, you can too!", "NAH. Take your chances with management.", "NTA, contact your landlord.  Let them know that your neighbor is harassing you to the point that your GF is afraid to go outside alone in case she meets him.  Let them know about the complaints he has, and that you think his complaint is with the college kids living above you based on the fact that you have to resort to sleeping medications and earplugs in order to sleep in your own apartment.  \n\nBut definitely file a complaint.  He has no right to act like he does, especially when you've continually shown that the noises aren't coming from you.", "NTA You might want to send an email to your landlord to get ahead of this narrative. Your work times with the facebook messages. The threatening body language and tone. Your girlfriend afraid to answer her own door.", "He's just continuing this because you actually respond to him and probably everyone else ignores him.  Just document what you have already told him via text.  Might keep a log of when you go to sleep and when you leave for work daily.  I would take that log to the landlord and let him know that this person is harassing you and you will not be responding to his complaints or threats.  If he calls or bangs on your door, ignore him and block his number.", "Dude, call the landlord before this guy does. NTA, you live in an apartment. Daytime ambient noise is fine.", "NTA.

I\u2019ve already sent them an email today. Worst part is that after he came to our door and complained when we had been away for a week, we agreed to think about our noise-level.

Or he\u2019s just incredibly sensitive to noise.", "Your neighbor is moving in 2 months? Great! They can go be TA to someone else.\n\n\nYou are NTA and I would start talking to your other neighbors to see what they know and if he's hounding them too.", "Thanks. I sent the landlord almost exactly what I wrote here, and I\u2019ll be recording every time he comes to the door from now on, taking screenshots etc.", "We had a similar situation, where a neighbour complained about noise when we were out or more often asleep.\n\nWe think this was because the local anti social behaviour teams will normally only get involved if the noise is between 11pm-7am, so he was manufacturing the times to suit his agenda.\n\nAs you've established, best to just ignore him now, and maybe get a doorbell camera or equivalent", "NTA.  You need to email or message the guy and inform him in writing that his contact with you has grown to be harassing and that he is to stop contacting you in *any* way, whether it be messages, emails, or knocking on your door.  If he continues to knock on your door, file a police report for harassment against him.  See if you live in a one party or two party consent state for audio recording and make sure and make an audio/video recording if he does knock on your door again to use as proof.", "NTA I had a neighbor like this once too! She used to write me note after angry note about the cigarette smell coming from my apartment. I\u2019ve never smoked in my life. No one has ever smoked in any apartment I\u2019ve ever lived in. The smell was clearly coming from the super, whose apartment was below ours and who smoked like a chimney. But nothing would stop her from writing those notes to me.", "NTA \nSounds like a fae infestation. Or someone's living in your walls and leaves and starts making noise when you sleep.", "Nta time to show the exchanges to the landlord, and explain how threatening he was behaving", "NTA  \nJust block the jerk", "NTA. Contact your landlord and send him screenshots.", "In the same situation with a neighbour right now but he may very well be sensitive to noise, but if that is the case, he should have a house in the middle of nowhere or go about with earplugs in lol"]}
