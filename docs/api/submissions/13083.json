It sounds like he wants to do exactly what you\u2019re worried about. Yikes.", "NTA. Inheritance does not have to be shared with spouses and in your case there is a family plan to be upheld that specifies No Spouses on the deed. Your husband is just going to have to get over it, as well as realize that he\u2019s legally wrong about the house & property that you bought together. He\u2019s throwing a tantrum, so I suppose you should just let him tire himself out. \n\nWhenever I see a partner (especially a new one like this) have a fit over inheritance it always makes me suspect they had plans for the money/land/whatever, and the fit happens when they realize their plan has been thwarted.", "NTA.\n\nOf course they are entirely different situations.  The law sees them as different too.\n\nTell him when he invents a time machine and goes back in time to help your ancestors to acquire and work that land, his name can go on the deed.\n\nAnd as far as his kids are concerned, you can point out that your kids will not request or be entitled to a share in anything his blood relatives pass down.", "NTA - if the shoe was on the other foot, he would also reserve his family land for his own children.  In situations like yours it would have been better for you to go to two different lawyers and type up two different prenuptial agreements before you got married.  Then you could have very calmly met in the middle and nobody's feelings would be hurt today.", "NTA - as long as your state abides, this is a non issue. Inheritance is not marital property \u2026 if it was intended that way, it would have been willed that way.\n\nThat aside, this doesn\u2019t look good for your marriage \u2026 and better you find out now that he\u2019s acts like a giant baby.", "NTA. You have been together for 2 years and he thinks he is entitled to half of that huge property. NOPE!", "NTA and make sure your will is up to date NOW, just in case. And...get a divorce attorney because I can see where this is going...", "Yeah, no. He's being ridiculous. \n\nYou're NTA. But get a lawyer on retainer just in case", "Wait, what, talk about burying the lede? Of course you get to keep the property you inherited from your parents in your family, not in your husband's.  \n\n\nBut he is now claiming the house you two bought TOGETHER is \"his\"? You are NTA. And wow, that's a major, major red flag. Your marital home is jointly yours. He shouldn't be trying to claim it as all his.", "NTA. please make sure your name is on on the house you two bought together.", "NTA.  His kids are not entitled to your property unless you will it to them.  And the house is a shared property you both bought so it doesn\u2019t make sense for him claim it as his own.  And you should absolutely not put his name because thats inheritance that will be going towards your kids rightfully.", "NTA", "NTA you two keep your finances separate, why would he even think he\u2019s entitled to your inheritance?", "NTA.\n\n He's not entitled to your inheritance just like you aren't entitled to his. And quite often it's off limits I nthe case of divorce. \n\nHe's very insecure about this, that's a bit of a problem", "Definitely NTA but I reckon you need to start consulting a lawyer ASAP to get this shit sewn up.

It is a weird thing to demand.", "Yta.", "NTA. And good luck to him in magically making the house and property you bought together\" his\" if you won't put your name on his family property. His name isn't on your family property title, so he has no claim. Your name is on the marital property, so you're a co-owner. And that's that. Anything else is just foot-stamping.\n\nYou can try refusing to discuss it anymore beyond a reasonable point and see if he gets over it eventually, but I suspect he's just going to stay resentful and throw it in your face whenever he can. I predict an upcoming theme of \"No, I'm not going to share this with you, because you won't put me on your family's property\" pouting. \n\nI don't think his behavior on this is a good sign, and you might want to have a clear-eyed conversation with yourself about whether he behaves this way in other areas of your life. Some of the first signs of my ex-husband's narcissism were what seemed like one-off issues in which he absolutely could not accept another viewpoint when both viewpoints had their pros and cons. I could see his perspective, but he couldn't see mine, or see why he even should. That didn't seem to fit in with who he seemed to be, so I was kind of bewildered by them but let them go. Eventually I realized that those things were not only part of who he was, but were core to who he was.", "NTA\n\nThe property you bought together should already have your name on the deed.  Your family farmland, though, should NOT.", "Nope NTA. Especially only being together 2 years and married 1. Inherited property is not the same as jointly own property. Inherited property is also not considered in the case of divorce in most states in the US, possibly all. The fact that he feels entitled to something that your family has had for generations is red flag number 1, assuming his name would go on the deed is red flag 2, and trying to call the joint martial home and property bought together just his is red flag 3!", "INFO:\n\nHow much of the house did you pay for. If he payed for 90% and put your name on the deed then yea yta if it was 50/50 then nta because of the situation with step kids.", "Seriously? And this man is how old?? What you guys got together as husband and wife are completely different than YOUR family inheritance. Sounds like he thinks he and his kids are entitled to something that isn't theirs, stick with your decision, that land most definitely should stay in YOUR family. I'm sure you would have let him like visit the property or something sheesh. Totally, most definitely, NTA!!", "NTA, it isn't a property you purchased together in any way.", "NTA, but I would admit that I feel like everything I have is \"ours\" because that's what I think a marriage is.  I do also see his point that your kids will now have more \"inheritance\" than his, because you are keeping some assets in your name only and some in both of your names.   I can certainly see the family resentment this will cause, and you will have to ultimately choose what is most important to you.   I can see this spreading to the whole family and ultimately causing a lot of stress and hurt feelings for everyone involved. \n\nI'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm saying his feelings are somewhat justified.  I can see your marriage turning into \"what is mine vs. what is yours vs. what is ours\" once you open this can of worms.", "NTA.  He\u2019s acting weird.   In most states inheritances are not shared with a spouse in a divorce - unless you put his name in it, then you\u2019d be screwed. So don\u2019t do it.   His request would make me super suspicious & thoroughly check his background.  \n\nMake sure you keep tabs on your finances.", "NAH\n\nLet me explain why as some of you would just like to shit on the husband which to a certain degree makes sense. But you\u2019re married OP it\u2019s obviously important to him to be treated fairly in the relationship and having 50/50 on most things however. You\u2019re 100% entitled to want to keep your land and not be an asshole. You however could\u2019ve communicated this a little better to your husband. Sat down and discussed it a little more carefully \u201cListen I know it\u2019s selfish of my but I\u2019d like to keep this land in my family. Put yourself in my shoes imagine this land is yours and yours only, and we\u2019ve only been together for 2 years. Imagine we, god forbid, get divorced and I somehow end up with the land. Wouldn\u2019t that be the worst? I\u2019m not doing this because I think divorce is in our future but because i strictly would like to leave this to my children.\u201d", "In the US, inherited property is excluded from marital property, as I found out because my parents are getting an ugly divorce. \n\nDefinitely don't put his name on that property, but also you both may need to do couples therapy/hire a lawyer to talk about how inheritance will work for your kids. \n\nIf you bought property together, it makes sense to me that it's split between both of your kids. (Maybe sold and then cash split X ways). \n\nHonestly you've only been married a year and feels a bit odd that he's going after your financials this hard.", "NTA. He had no claim to your families land. And him saying that because of that the house you both live in is his alone is a red flag. He's shown you he cares more about the money than you", "NTA. But it\u2019s an inherited asset - you shouldn\u2019t ever combine inherited assets with household assets as they are protected in divorce (in the unhappy event it occurs down the line).", "NTA.\n\nBeen together for two years and married for a year? Talk about a speedy relationship. Anyway, on the off chance y\u2019all get divorced he could try to sue for ownership of the farm so what you\u2019re doing is wrong. \n\nBesides, it's your inheritence and you can do whatever you want with it", "I see you've written this post while a robbery was in progress. \n\nNTA, your inherited property is yours and yours alone. What you bought together with him is joint property, and he does not get to decide by himself who inherits it.

Your inheritance has nothing to do with him.  He's acting like a greedy child.", "For God's sake, DO NOT DO THIS!!", "ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SIGN IT OP!! He is blatently telling you that he cares more about money and possessions than you. This relationship is purely for materialistic advantage for him.
