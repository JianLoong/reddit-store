Of course I said yes and I was actually excited when she asked me to help pick out bridesmaid dresses for my middle sister and I. \n\nThe wedding is in the summer in Texas so I know it's going to be HOT so when I was helping look for dresses I was looking for something that won't be too warm and that comes in both plus size for me and regular size for middle sis. I sent a few options and found one I really liked.\n\nEven bride sister agreed it was a really cute dress but then she brought up the fact that it would show off my tattoos. Up until this point I didn't even occur to me that my tattoos would be an issue, so for her to casually bring up the fact that she expects me to cover them all... I found it a bit insulting. Not to mention impractical as I would have to wear long sleeves and a high neckline to cover them all in 100 degree weather.\n\nAt first I pretended I wasn't hurt but then she said that she \"didn't want my tattoos to be the focal point of her wedding photos.\" I was extremely insulted at this point and blew up at her. I didn't mean to get so upset but I was very hurt by the way she brought it up and the way she worded it, like my tattoos would ruin her photos and that I didn't fit into the esthetic of her wedding. \n\nI feel she had no tact and could have approached the situation in several other ways that wouldn't have come off so rude.

Her mental picture of her ideal wedding includes a \"sanitized\" version of you.", "I would like to add that I apologized for getting upset with her and explained the way she brought it up was really a shock to me and I wasn't expecting to have to fully cover myself. She \"apologized\" by saying she was sorry that I got offended by and that she shouldn't have to \"sugar coat\" things when speaking to family.", "NTA. Because you apologized and I understand why you were upset. I know this sub is very big on \u201cit\u2019s the bride\u2019s day\u201d and that\u2019s true, but a wedding day (which in hindsight is never as big a deal as it seems at the time) shouldn\u2019t drive a wedge between family members over petty issues. I have precisely one photo of our wedding party on display. Many people I know only have photos of the bridal couple framed and displayed. The rest of the photos are in an album collecting dust or on social media (and nobody besides the bride looks at those more than once). Don\u2019t most people who will be at the wedding know what you look like already? Has nobody who is familiar with your sister seen a tattooed person before? Who does she think will be so focused on your tattoos that they don\u2019t notice the bride in the wedding pictures?", "I don't think she approached this badly, unless she used wording not mentioned here. How I see it, is that she casually mentioned how she would prefer the tats being covered up, which I do not think is completely unreasonable considering she didn't demand it. I also see why you may got hurt about it, since I guess they stand for who you are. \n\nNAH, have an honest conversation about this and find a middle ground.", "NTA.

You should have known when you made that decision that they would not be acceptable in certain situations. So you either forgo those activities or cover them with concealer or clothing. You know your tattoos attract attention, people probably stop on the street to look at them. Its not just about photoshopping them out of pictures. You are going to standing up in front of everyone next to your sister at her wedding. You will be distracting and taking attention from your sister on her wedding day, during the ceremony. It may not be deliberate but it will happen. Everyone will be looking at the tattooed lady instead of the bride.\n\nYou be you, if tattoos make you happy, have at it.

All or nothing, NTA . As for your mom if yall work it out she'll be OK.", "So let me get this straight. Your sister, the bride, wants to be the center of attention on her own wedding, correct?\n\nI wouldn't even think of calling her a bridezilla for that!\n\nTattoos are cool in my opinion but if you are more or less a walking and talking piece of art (even if it's a masterwork) you will attract attention and be honest, you know that already.

Had she just asked me to cover them or had just picked out the dress we would not have gotten into the argument.", "Out of interest, I see in comments you\u2019re saying it\u2019s the way she bought it up that upset you. How could she have bought it up without upsetting you? Not saying she\u2019s in the right here, although I can see her point, but just wondering how else she could have approached it", "YTA it's her wedding and I saw a tattooed bridesmaid on photos with the bride, it is definitely distracting. It also plays into role, what your tattoos are? Flowers and butterfly's might me okay, but if you have monsters or Robots or celebrities? I wouldn't want that either.", "NTA just tell her you don\u2019t \u2018have\u2019 to be in any of her photos if it offends her that much.", "YTA. Massively. Those of us covered in tattoos understand that not every situation or occasion is going to be appropriate to expose our tattoos. You overreactive massively. The way she brought it up I don't see being offensive at all between sisters? Not only that but you threw a goddamn tantrum and told her that since she didn't like your tattoos and maybe she she just find someone else more aesthetically pleasing. Which you conveniently left out of your post and out of all of your responses telling people that she removed you from the wedding party lol. Yep. You threw tantrum during what should have been a sweet sort of bonding thing with her bridesmaids and told her to pick someone else. And when she did the next day you did the internet equivalent of a shocked Pikachu face that she immediately found someone who could be more reliable and then came on Reddit and left out various details so that you get some sympathy points. Come on man. Tattoo covering makeup or a light shawl or choosing a different dress wouldn't have been a big ass deal. She was worried that the photos would focus on your tattoos and then you made the dress shopping experience all about your tattoos it cost a huge situation over what could have been nothing. And now you're on here pretending like she just kicked you out and she's being a bridezilla when you're the one who caused a huge fight by having a tantrum and telling her that she should find someone else?", "So she didn't apologize then", "lmao I would not be attending the wedding. People who are rude write kindness off as sugary when it's literally just basic decency and I couldn't vibe with it. Have fun sweating your balls off I'll be air conditioned and tattoos out!", "I mean it sounds like she\u2019s still reeling from your abrupt reaction to what isn\u2019t an outlandish request or assumption for her to make\u2026..", "See that\u2019s just it. I don\u2019t think sister actually wants to cover who OP is. \n\nI have a friend who is covered in tattoos with a really beautiful and large piece on her chest. When she goes to fancier events (formal weddings, galas) I noticed she often wears a boatneck neckline. I never asked but once when we were shopping she said that she wanted something with more coverage there because it was formal. \n\nI asked, have people ever said anything to you? She said no, it\u2019s her preference; in her eyes sometimes the ink takes away from the formal look she\u2019s going for when she wants something more simple. \n\nI really have a feeling that\u2019s where sister is coming from but here\u2019s Reddit with the \u201cbridezilla\u201d and \u201ctattoos are part of you\u201d. Yeah my hair is part of me I wear a messy bun every day. I do it differently for formal occasions.", "I have cats and flowers.", "Sorry for being human ig", "\u2026..it sounds like you\u2019re most mad about not getting your choice of dress??\n\nand it sounds more like she just assumed you\u2019d feel the same way about covering them for a wedding?", "Oh, for heaven's sake! Why doesn't she just have them photo shopped out in her final pictures?", "Cool meaning she assumed you were probably on the same page \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be rude but that statement, coupled with \u201cl was actually excited to look at dresses\u201d suggests to me that you may not be the easiest person to do these activities with anyway. \n\nShe didn\u2019t say cover up fully. She doesn\u2019t want tattoos to be the focal point. There\u2019s a middle ground here. Find it.", "Oh geez. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t even attend without a real apology.", "The tattoos are a permanent part of the OP's body.  She can stand up with her sister on her wedding day, but sister needs to accept the OP for who she is.", "I mean to be fair it\u2019s possible she assumed that explosive behavior will be a trend. You mention you are both hard-headed. I get why she chose to avoid further incident", "Again you\u2019re making it clear your actual issue is being upset your choice wasn\u2019t *the* choice lol", "Jesus, that\u2019s a stretch. The bride didn\u2019t remove anyone\u2019s bodily autonomy. She said she\u2019d prefer that sister wear something that covers her tattoos, sister freaked out and said no, and the bride said \u201cokay, you don\u2019t have to be in the wedding\u201d. The bride very much respected her bodily autonomy. \n\nAlso, we\u2019ve got to chill with this \u201cremoving someone else\u2019s bodily autonomy\u201d bullshit. It\u2019s customary for a bridesmaid to wear the dress a bride picks out, that\u2019s not abusive nor is it removing their bodily autonomy. You sound dramatic, but you end up taking away from real abusive situations when you accuse everyone of being abusive.", "I swear the posts on this sub make it seem like people getting married want everyone else to wear potato sacks and meditate on the couple the whole wedding.", "I'm not mad about the dress. I would wear whatever she told me to. It was the pretentious way she assumed I knew I would have to cover them. Why ask me to help pick out the dress and insist that she wants me to be comfortable in what I'm wearing but then suddenly pull this? She should have just picked the dress herself instead of asking for my input. I didn't think I would have to cover my skin. It's an outside wedding in summer in Texas and I don't tolerate heat well due to health conditions. It seemed impractical. My tattoos have never been an issue before. I stood up in my best friend's wedding a few months prior to my sister asking me and my friend took no issue with them. I stood up in middle sister's wedding with tattoos and no issue. Bride sister has never said anything about me covering them for any other occasion. She should have been up front about it when she asked me to be a bridesmaid or just picked someone else who fits her aesthetic. Instead, she brought it up in a callous way and that is why I got upset.", "My tattoos are all over my body including my chest, shoulders, forearms, legs...etc.", "I considered not attending but then my mom called me crying, saying we are sisters and shouldn't be fighting and now I feel obligated to go to appease my mom.", "How so?", "Jfc asking someone to wear your preferred bridesmaid dress for a bit additional tattoo coverage is not asking someone to make themselves smaller", "Has she tried making the same argument with your sister?\nParents will always want the kids to get along. But you should start assessing if your sister is a positive presence in your life and how you will feel if she continues to treat you this way. If you don\u2019t take stand, she will keep thinking she can get away with half-baked apologies and acting callous.", "I\u2019m missing the part where what she said was rude. It sounds like she casually and nicely brought it up\u2026", "Yeah, sorry to say, but it definitely sounds like you overreacted.", "Bingo. \n\nWe see from OPs comments too that what really got her angry was looking at dresses, giving her opinion, and the bride simply having a different opinion. \n\n\u201cI was actually excited to look at dresses\u201d ok weird choice of words sure not everyone loves shopping but hm\n\nThen she specifies that she\u2019s mad she was asked for her opinion and then the bride was like oh I want more coverage \n\nLike obviously the bride assumed OP would assume the same as her and then communicated that. \n\nBut no no it\u2019s gotta be \u201cbridezilla!\u201d And \u201ctattoos are part of you!\u201d I have multiple friends who choose to wear more coverage for formal events for their tattoos. Not to not offend anyone or censor themselves but because they want a simpler look that to them is formal and doesn\u2019t include as much tattoo showing.", "This is why I tried sticking up for myself bcuz I am always the doormat in relationships and I need to stand my ground. I guess I picked the wrong battle to start doing so.", "Again: are you really mad about being asked to cover your tattoos \n\nOr were you reactive to your choice being declined\n\nYou\u2019re hung up on her not telling you proactively. You have multiple comments here saying that assumption is pretty common, that formal wear will offer more coverage of tattoos for a formal event. Why can\u2019t you consider that she assumed you knew this and when it was clear you didn\u2019t, she set the expectation then?\n\nYou\u2019re acting like she tried to catch you out. \u201cAh-HAH but *what about your tattoos huh*? Cuz I hate them!! And that dress won\u2019t work, neither! Mwahahah!\u201d \n\nLike that\u2019s not what was said lol", "That's why I apologized the very next day. I realized I may have overreacted and apologized with a cool head. She already replaced me with another bridesmaid."]}
