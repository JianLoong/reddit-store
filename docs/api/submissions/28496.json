When you go as a group, pay your own way. Yes, it's a hassle for the wait staff, but just be nice and give them a bit of an extra tip. If it's going out to celebrate someone's birthday, it is common courtesy to share the celebrant's meal/drinks among the crowd.", "NTA. I could get it if everyone had ordered similar items so the price for each individual meal was roughly the same but it wasn't.

Next time, tell your server at the start that you're on a separate ticket.", "Info\n\nYou said Lisa was disappointed, but are you sure she was disappointed about the way things were being split, and not the fact that no one was offering to cover her bill?

Cuz a $10 more for a night with friends is different from spending $60 more than your own.", "ESH for not working it out ahead of time. I agree with you not paying equal but it\u2019s gotta be agreed on before dinner. (And you all split birthday girls meal/drinks regardless)", "NTA. For what it\u2019s worth I doubt anyone was trying to screw you over. It\u2019s more likely that people weren\u2019t keeping track of how much everyone else was ordering and just assumed you\u2019d all ordered roughly the same amount of food. \n\nFrom a social convention perspective it may have been more appropriate just to go along with it and eat the cost, but that depends more on how much it would cost to only pay for your food vs how much it would cost to split the bill evenly. If it was matter of \u201cI only budgeted x amount for this meal and am not comfortable paying more than that\u201d then your reaction feels socially appropriate.

Some thing similar happened in our friends group. Generally when someone invites you to their celebration dinner/lunch, they pay the bill. Unless splitting it was discussed in advance. One time a friend's girlfriend decided to celebrate her promotion and invited all of us to dinner. (Keep in mind there was no discussion of splitting the bill). No one ordered expensive food considering she was paying the bill. However, when the bill came she decided we should split it equally. Most of us were ohkie with it. But 2 of our friends have had tons of financial responsibilities for as long as we know them and they are very careful about spending money which we respect. Even with minimal ordering it was quite the bill coz she chose a fancy place. Our friends dint like it one bit and suggested they pay for the dishes they ordered only. She was might upset and made a scene about how her boyfriends friends don't care for her. We eventually did only pay for what we ordered and she landed up having the biggest share (guess why..lol) her boyfriend had to pay it. And she never invited us again \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I feel like this exact scenario is posted like every three days.", "NTA The way a bill is split should be discussed before anything is ordered so you don\u2019t come off like an ass when the bill shows up. And I agree with you, if you ordered just a few throngs and nothing as major as the rest, then you shouldn\u2019t be expected to pay. The only thing I would have done is paid for my food and drink and chipped in for the birthday girl\u2019s meal and what not.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nYou should not have to pay for what you didn't eat. You ate significantly less than the others, but they still wanted everyone to pay evenly.\n\nWhat a ripoff.  Not your friends.\n\nYou might want to avoid eating out with them again or ask for separate checks before putting in a food order.", "NTA, but you should have sorted out the payment plan before, not after, then it wouldn\u2019t have put a damper on things. This is always going to be a problem in a large group, there\u2019ll always be one or two having far less than the rest.", "NTA but people really need to hammer out the splitting of the bill beforehand so that this stops happening", "I've been seeing a LOT of these stories here over the last month. I think a good standard procedure would be to discuss this amongst all the diners BEFORE ordering, or even before heading out to the restaurant.  This idea of wining and dining and THEN setting up the cost-share is ridiculous and unfair.", "NTA - Everyone didn\u2019t have to pay individually. They could have just split the remainder of the bill once you paid your part.", "NTA.  When perusing the menu is the time to bring this up.  \u201cWe\u2019re doing separate checks, right?\u201d", "NTA - these situations are very tough. I think to prevent these kinds of disagreements you either decide before ordering what is going to be the bill payment method or you just order the same as everybody else, so it is even. I agree I would not want to pay for somebody else\u2019s booze and expensive meal.", "NTA\n\nThe time to decide to split the check equally is before everyone orders. Your friends should not expect you to subsidize their meals.", "NTA.   \nI am a little confused here ... did they end up splitting the bill after your contribution or did you end up paying the same as the others?  \nUsually people end up owing around the same amount and the under/over is only a couple of dollars so it doesn't matter all that much. Friends should be more aware and considerate when one person owes much less than the rest.  \nGood for you, you were right to speak up.", "YTA IF you didn\u2019t pay the share of the birthday person\u2019s dinner. Also, these kinds of things should be figured out in advance. If you had shared with the organizer \u201cI\u2019m just going to have an appetizer and a drink as I\u2019m a little short on cash right now\u201d I think everybody would\u2019ve understood and might\u2019ve moderated their own ordering. But they say at the end of the meal, you\u2019re not going to split it, while you\u2019re entitled to do that,is also not cool.", "NTA.  The only people happy with splitting bills are those who have had most but pay less.  Only pay for what you had.  The rest can split the remaining amount if they wish.", "Nta", "NTA - but don\u2019t you all discuss this before? I mean it\u2019s a bit odd to speak up at the time of settling the bill, but I understand how it may feel seeing you didn\u2019t order much as others did. But typically, when everyone reaches the restaurant, I thought there is a quick rule to say let\u2019s all divvy up equally or let\u2019s all pay for what we order and let the server know accordingly", "And this is why at the last several birthday parties at restaurants or bars I made it clear to the server and/or bartender I am on my own tab. Definitely NTA.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t order a 3 course meal and you kept your drinks to a minimum. Let all of them pay for their own meals", "NTA. Next time you go for these so called birthday dinners tell the waiter/waitress that you want a separate bill. I used to work at a restaurant and believe when I tell you that it's not a big deal. If someone asks then we would do it.", "Always ask for a separate check when ordering. NTA", "NTA, if everybody but the birthday girl wants to be nice, split her bill between you. Otherwise, no reason to subsidize the random other attendee....", "classic oder-the-whole-menu-and-THEN-ask-to-split-afterwards BS. NTA never will be", "Hmmm, normally I would say it\u2019s fine to just cover your portion but I think things are different at a birthday celebration. I have never not split the bill between everyone, with the birthday person not paying anything. It feels a bit miserly for a birthday celebration", "NTA, a lot of people use this as an excuse to be super greedy and order lots of expensive stuff knowing that everyone will share the cost equally.  It makes sense for everyone to pay for what they eat and it's not your job to pay for their food for them!", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised your friend was hurt\u2014why? Was her meal not covered amongst the group? And honestly what were these people uncomfortable about, paying for their own meals? What?! If they were coming prepared to split it evenly, shouldn\u2019t they have been prepared if some random person ordered something insane and drove their cost up higher than what they ordered? What odd and entitled people\u2026", "As a former waitress I can honestly say that it really wasn't a hassle to have separate checks for the many people in a group of diners, especially if they tell you when ordering.  Yes, it's a little more work but no more so than dealing with separate tables as opposed to a group table.", "Best way to signal this is to tell the server to split the check when ordering that way it\u2019s not a question.", "[removed]", "There are many different cultural views on birthdays. Some cultures the bday person is supposed to pay it all, in others it is common to gift a party to the bday person.", "Funny how these customs vary. In my family, people you invite to your birthday are *your guests* so you pay; whether it's at a restaurant or at home, you provide the food and drinks etc. The belief is that these people are taking time out to help you celebrate *your* occasion. Everyone brings a gift, though.\n\nGift giving gives you control - a person of lesser means can choose something that's not going to blow their budget. In the scenario mentioned, things can spiral, especially if people are having numerous cocktails and I think it's sad to make someone who may be struggling pay for Johnny's 10 Pina Colada's and 3 course meal. Most people would just pay up but it's not a comfortable position to be in.", "Depends on the country how common splitting bills is, some places don't", "Lisa organised the birthday dinner and invited OP.
