Some thing similar happened in our friends group. Generally when someone invites you to their celebration dinner/lunch, they pay the bill. Unless splitting it was discussed in advance. One time a friend's girlfriend decided to celebrate her promotion and invited all of us to dinner. (Keep in mind there was no discussion of splitting the bill). No one ordered expensive food considering she was paying the bill. However, when the bill came she decided we should split it equally. Most of us were ohkie with it. But 2 of our friends have had tons of financial responsibilities for as long as we know them and they are very careful about spending money which we respect. Even with minimal ordering it was quite the bill coz she chose a fancy place. Our friends dint like it one bit and suggested they pay for the dishes they ordered only. She was might upset and made a scene about how her boyfriends friends don't care for her. We eventually did only pay for what we ordered and she landed up having the biggest share (guess why..lol) her boyfriend had to pay it.

A lot restaurants in my country ask before if it's all the table in the check or not. People who ask for a separate bill order along with everybody, but the waiter/waitress marks on two papers, tablets, hand, some bars even give you a card with a number and a bar code so the waiter just *beeps* when the food arrives the respective clients card.

I can't eat solid food when my TMJ is giving me issues, too much pain for little reward, so I just order a separate tab and at best order an appetizer to eat 1/6 and share with the table (and I always offer to share saying \"please help yourself, I'll cover this one\"). I don't have insane friends that think I should pay for smelling their meal and have the pleasure of observing them eat it.\n\nWhen I invite, I am clear \"we are splitting the appetizers and couverts, but drinks and main dishes each ones pays their part\" or \"everyone on their own\" or even \"we are planning on splitting the bill for ordering 'x', would you like to join?\" that way we all have a good time and who is on a budget can eat without having a panic attack whenever someone orders a shrimp and lamb master blaster blue cheese bazooka.

If, on the other hand, you decided to stick with just your appetizer and non-alcoholic drink then that'd be on you since the prior agreement would've been to split the bill evenly.", "NTA. It is always those who order the most expensive foods and drinks who are hurt and/or angry when others don't want to split the bill equally.", "I seriously do not understand how grown adults have not learned the phrase, \"Separate checks, please.\"\n\nUnless one of us makes it clear up front that they\u02bbre paying, we all say this when we go out to eat.\n\nNTA", "I see this situation come up often and it seems the only people pissed off about someone wanting to pay for just what they ordered and not split the bill are the ones who ordered lobster and shit.", "NTA.  These things should be discussed in advance, and Lisa should not be expected to pay for her items, as it is her birthday dinner.   The right thing should be to pay for one's own items and a share of Lisa's.  However, unless I had chosen such a light order because I was broke, I would just pay the split to keep the peace at this point.", "Yes, you should have only paid your fair share. Possibly the discomfort you felt sitting before the others was actually shared by the others. Seems your friend played a strange game with her birthday party invite. Plan ahead know what excuse to give on your next birthday invite. Push any memories of that ridiculous night away, I'm sure many of the group woke the next day feeling awkward over not paying their full glutinous share. Find your peace, people can be unaware of their behavior.", "Yup. Happened to me when I'd just started in a job, with pretty measly pay. A team of us went on a business trip (arbitration case). Big Boss suggested we all go out for dinner at the end to a snazzy place; after a look at the prices, I stuck with a salad and a glass of wine, which allowed me to stay within the expense allowance. Big boss ordered three bottles of wine, appetizers, steaks, the works. And then wanted to split. After a look at my panicky face, my immediate supervisor announced to Big Boss that splitting was a non-starter as it was entirely inequitable. He grumbled something, but she stood her (my) ground. I found my professional role model that day.", "I\u2019ve learned to bring cash.", "Apparently I'm old...Seinfeld covered this rather well. The salad eater gets screwed and the steak eater gets a deal. Op is NTA", "The last time I went with a group and agreed to split evenly, some asshole ordered some really expensive beef after the original order and despite 33% of the group not eating beef. We ended up paying triple what we should have to subsidize him. People will do anything they can to take advantage of others, but you learn who you should never go out with. (Yes, we could have caused a fuss, but didn\u2019t)", "It seems bizarre that big boss wouldn't just put it on the company card as a write off.  It happens all the time.  Our big boss took my entire team out because we over exceeded our goal for the year.  He had challenged us to this goal, and we went way above expectations.  He took us to a very expensive restaurant, Ordered multiple bottles of wine.  And PAID.  Didn't even suggest splitting the bill.  The company covers it.  It's an expense the company can write off as long as there is at least a small discussion that is 'work related.'", "When my wife and I go out with other couples or our whole family goes out with another family we often just split the bill in half for convenience if we know it\u2019s going to be pretty close so u don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird.\n\nAnd yeah with birthdays or a work lunch where someone is leaving the team everyone gets their own but chips in to cover the person.\n\nYour third world dining sounds ahead of what we have in Canada which is way ahead of what they have in the states.", "I\u2019ve been fighting the host/guest argument on here forever. Apparently nobody is aware of the \u201cif you\u2019re my guest because I invited you, I\u2019m paying\u201d concept anymore.", "I think it really depends on the relationship. My siblings and I tend to argue over whose turn it is to pay. Doesn't matter who invited who, we all still try and pay for each other.", "I\u2019m a believer in the \u201cyou invite, you pay\u201d rule.  I would not, however, extend this to bday dinners.  If my friend invites me to her bday dinner, I would at the very least *offer* to pay for her meal, even if her intention was to pay for herself.  \n\nI just wouldn\u2019t let my friend pay for own bday meal.  And I would *never* allow the bday person to pay for *mine*, whether she extended the invite or not.", "The 2nd highest up the ladder pays for it, then the highest approves it.\n\nAlways happens at business functions :)", "Well, the \"company\" in this case was the government and there are rules about EXACTLY how much you can claim for dinner! His expense limit was the same as mine, he was just much more willing to exceed it out of his own pocket (especially if lil' baby employee me would subsidize that).  To his credit, we had a much bigger case a few years down the road, and he DID buy all the wine then. On his own dime.", "Eh I think it might be a difference of opinion on the word \"invite?\"\n\nTo me \"Iam having a bday dinner at x restaurant for my bday if you want to come.\" Is an invite, but not creating a host/guest relationship. Hosting 10+ even 2+ can be expensive. \n\nI have said \" I want to treat you for your bday let's go to XYZ place\" that is an invite with host/guest expectations. \n\nThe idea that if you ask someone to join you at something you have to pay for them seems absurd to me. To me the default is everyone is paying their own way unless stated otherwise.", "See, that \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d thing isn\u2019t the issue for me?  I definitely wouldn\u2019t expect the person whose birthday is being celebrated to pay, I\u2019d expect to split that, and pay my own tab too, in this case.\n\nOverall though, and I think it\u2019s probably a generational thing, if I invite another person to an event, I am expecting, and prepared, to pay for the basic \u201cthing\u201d at the least, as well as any obligatory costs that would be part of it. If I invite you to dinner and a movie, I\u2019m paying for your dinner order and movie ticket as well as mine.  I may not pay if you decide after the movie that you really want to go get ice cream, since that was not on my initiative/agenda, but I\u2019d go with you and hang out!"]}
