I'll call back . . . \" \n\nFrankly, I'm an avid quilter, but I wouldn't interrupt my spouse for help if he was on a call.

You had no way of knowing how important what your wife wanted was. And it ended up not being that important, or rather time sensitive.\n\nYour wife only gets a mild YTA, more for giving you the silent treatment than actually being upset. Doctors are usually busy, so your wife might feel like she needs more time from you, and instead of telling you outright, she's behaving like this. I'd suggest sitting down to have an honest talk with her about her feelings, and would also suggest having a date night or something similar with her soon.", "Info does your wife think that you are not attentive?

You were on an important phone call with a colleague, and it was reasonable to complete the call before addressing your wife's request. Your wife's request was not an emergency, and it could have waited. However, it might have been better if you had acknowledged your wife's request by gesturing that you would be with her soon.

Maybe she feels you should have trusted her and assumed it was situation 2, something truly urgent.
