Most weeks I cook for my gf and/or get her snacks and plan my groceries accordingly, but this week she's out of town visiting family and I have no food to spare. I'm cutting right now and will fall asleep hungry and cranky if I miss a single snack. Thus why I'm unwilling to share.\n\nAnyways, Bella said I'm stingy, selfish, and a bad host. I told her she isn't *my* guest, I'm letting her stay with us as a favor to Tommy but I'd prefer if she wasn't here. She told me that this is why I'm single (she doesn't know I have a gf because she doesn't bother asking about my life and I'm happy to not share), I told her I'd rather stay single than date someone like her and she's lucky Tommy puts up with her.

She's aiming to manipulate the situation so she can have whatever she wants.", "You're already helping out by letting her stay, if you make his life easier by apologising, she'll probably make your life harder by taking your food whenever she wants. \n\nAlso, I hate the \"but I'm a guest\" aspect of this - even if she was a real guest, not somebody you're doing a favour to by letter her stay, guests don't get to just eat whatever they want or do whatever they want in the house they're staying in. If I'm staying at a friend's house, I never just grab random food from the fridge, even if I'm at my friend's house where I know that this will be ok - that's not appropriate guest behaviour.", "No need to feel bad for him.

He needs to learn that he has three options:\n\n1. Avoid people like his current gf (who could eventually become an ex-gf!) and look for people who are less self-centered.\n2. Keep choosing people like his current gf but learn to be bluntly clear about the boundaries they try to cross and be clear that he will (1) hold them accountable for themselves and (2) not support them in their boundary-stomping activities. (probably a tedious life/not promising for keeping gf in his life).\n3. Keep choosing people like his current gf and continue to be wimpy about calling them out on poor behavior/boundaries they cross. That will ensure that he gets to keep gf in his life and likely lead to him losing the good people in his life who don't want put up with gf's crap.

She definitely has main character syndrome. Not only that, Tommy should have already laid the ground rules out before she came to stay with you, so don't go feeling bad if she gives him shit for the fact that you have boundaries that she feels entitled to overstep.

If she wants fruit that badly, she can always walk across the street.  As you mentioned, she's your roomie's guest, not yours.

She was being entitled.  She didn't even ask.  She just assumed she could eat it bc she's there.  This is going to be a long 2 weeks.  I'm sorry for you.", "NTA - She's a guest, not a prisoner. And not even your guest. She can walk herself down to the corner bodega/7-11/grocery store and get what she wants for herself. or she can ask her bf to take her. or to get it for her. But OUR stuff is off-limits.\n\nSeriously, make note of exactly what you have cause with 2 weeks of this I wouldn't NOT trust her to keep her paws to herself. She will eat your food, lie about eating it, scream when told (again) to stop... It's about to get ridiculous up in there.\n\nCan you fix Tommy up with someone that's not insanely entitled?", "NTA. She's clearly not your responsibility and you're entitled to what you own whatever reason there is (especially that you only have enough for yourself). You can be hospitable in some other ways but not to the expense of your own wellbeing.", "No. By not apologising, you might actually HELP everyone in the long-run. If you apologise, you could easily feel unfairly treated and resentful. And she'll immediately start trying to manipulate you in other ways, if she thinks she can win/manipulate you, through unreasonable behaviour. \n\nThe more people who don't pander to her, the better the chance she eventually grows up (though perhaps that's an optimistic hope). And indeed, that would actually help her. Her entitlement complex will not generally advantage her in life. \n\nAlso, these sorts of incidents, are even doing Timmy a favour in the long run. He needs to see the whole person he's dating, if it is going to be a long-term relationship. It might make his life 'easier' (to apologise) in the short-term. But it's storing up even more problems for him in the future, by people capitulating to make his life temporarily 'easier'. He needs to learn how to stand up to her.", "Don't feel bad for your roommate- Apparently whatever she gives him is worth the crap he puts up with from her, and he's a good enough person to realize you shouldn't have to suffer, too.", "Don't apologize as she will feel she found a weak spot and try again with you.  Hopefully, it truly is just 2 weeks she is there.", "She can put her big girl pants on and buy her own food.

If you'd allowed her to take your food, she would have gotten worse over the next two weeks.", "Nta - \u2018you\u2019re a bad host\u2019 \u2018you are not my guest\u2019 perfect answer!", "NTA. STand your ground!", "NTA. Entitled brat that isn't used to being told no. Also, if you know you're staying for two weeks, maybe plan to buy your own groceries and necessities for that time frame. Just because y'all are offering her a place to sleep until her new place is ready doesn't mean you're responsible for her.", "If he wants to put the pussy on a pedestal over his own self-esteem, that's his problem, not yours.", "That\u2019s Tommy\u2019s problem- not yours. You\u2019re being totally reasonable. NTA.", "This dude will never have an easy life with a gf like this. Lol\n\nTell him he should rather get used to not having an easy life than asking other ppl to apologize to his gf to make his life easier. \n\nIf life gets too hard, he can always get rid of her.", "You don't exist to enable entitled assholes to steal your food, NTA.", "Who cares? Tommy gets so put on that he might break up with her? Not sad. Tommy just basically told you he would back you, but it would be really swell of you, golly gee, if you just rolled over for her and did him a solid. That would be making his life easier in the short term. Think long term.", "> if he were me he'd stand his ground without apologizing for anything. But he also said it would make his life easier if I did, which I already knew.\n\nSo he'd rather you lose than grow a spine?", "I can understand that but the one thing you can\u2019t control is Tommy\u2019s terrible choice of gf, so this was bound to happen.", "NAT.He\u2019d buy her some fruit and yogurt and tell her to not take your food.", "Yip!"]}
