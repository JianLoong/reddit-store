A few weeks ago Tommy asked if his girlfriend Bella (26F) could stay with us for two weeks. She's moving apartments and has time between leases. I begrudgingly agreed on the condition that she won't bother me for anything. I do not like Bella. Mainly because she constantly picks fights with Tommy over dumb shit. I also find her to be entitled, lacking empathy, and having \"I'm the main character\" energy. She's entertaining but I think she's unpleasant to be around overall.\n\nSo this morning was her first morning of \"living\" with us. I'm in the kitchen making my breakfast. Bella comes out, goes through our fridge, and pulls out my fruit and my greek yogurt. I notice and tell her that both of those are mine, she can eat from Tommy's groceries which are all on the left side of the fridge. She tells me \"but Tommy doesn't have fruit!\" I tell her there's a grocery store across the street.\n\nFor some background, I plan out everything I eat each week gymbro style. Unless my gf wants to go out, I'll eat every meal at home. I also hate wasting food. I go grocery shopping once a week and buy exactly what I know will be eaten in one week, no more, no less. Most weeks I cook for my gf and/or get her snacks and plan my groceries accordingly, but this week she's out of town visiting family and I have no food to spare. I'm cutting right now and will fall asleep hungry and cranky if I miss a single snack. Thus why I'm unwilling to share.\n\nAnyways, Bella said I'm stingy, selfish, and a bad host. I told her she isn't *my* guest, I'm letting her stay with us as a favor to Tommy but I'd prefer if she wasn't here. She told me that this is why I'm single (she doesn't know I have a gf because she doesn't bother asking about my life and I'm happy to not share), I told her I'd rather stay single than date someone like her and she's lucky Tommy puts up with her. She went running to Tommy demanding he make me apologize.

Damn, that\u2019s going to be a long two weeks.", "Nta\n\nShe needs to be more grateful for a place to stay. If she pushes the issue, remind her (or your roommate) that you'd be more than happy to change your mind on letting her stay there, and attempting to insult you again will be an immediate expulsion from your home.", "NTA but you should be aware that she is going to eat all of your food out of spite. Tommy needs to reimburse you.", ">Anyways, Bella said I'm stingy, selfish, and a bad host.\n\nYou're not her host and you hate her. Why are asking about this?

You paid for that fruit and Greek yogurt and it's your property", "NTA\n\nIf you apologize, she'll think your food is fair game. No.", "NTA\n\nShe can go to the store and get her own groceries. Or she can ask her boyfriend to buy certain things.", "Yeah, she's not leaving in 2 weeks. Best you know that right now and start planning a strategy - NTA", "NTA she sounds very entitled. She\u2019s not your gf nor guest nor friend you both just have someone in common in your lives. Keep us updated because this sounds like it\u2019s going to be a long two weeks.", "Lol. \n\nNTA\n\nNot your girlfriend, not your problem.", "Do not apologize. But if you are going to make it through the next 2 weeks in one piece and not come out a gibbering idiot at the end of it, maybe call a house meeting to set up some hard ground rules. Make it clear that she is there because Tommy asked. The end. But that does not give her free reign to you or your stuff or disrespect you in your own house. \n\nNTA", "The main reason I feel bad is that this is probably gonna rebound to Tommy. He apologized on her behalf and said that if he were me he'd stand his ground without apologizing for anything.

She created her own problem.  Even my past sh\\*tty roommates knew not to eat others' food.  She owes **you** an apology.  And your roommate's life would be easier if he wasn't dating someone who felt so entitled.", "Yes, it would be easier for *him* if you apologized for doing nothing wrong... doing the hard (right) thing of reminding his girlfriend that she's *his* guest, and not yours, would just be so inconvenient.", "Don't apologise though. She's aiming to manipulate the situation so she can have whatever she wants.", "You're already helping out by letting her stay, if you make his life easier by apologising, she'll probably make your life harder by taking your food whenever she wants. \n\nAlso, I hate the \"but I'm a guest\" aspect of this - even if she was a real guest, not somebody you're doing a favour to by letter her stay, guests don't get to just eat whatever they want or do whatever they want in the house they're staying in. If I'm staying at a friend's house, I never just grab random food from the fridge, even if I'm at my friend's house where I know that this will be ok - that's not appropriate guest behaviour.", "No need to feel bad for him. He chose her, so this is his life. If he\u2019s staying with her then she must be bringing something to the table that makes her worth it the drama to him.", "NTA but man this is going to be a long two weeks for you lol"]}
