One house is our main house, the other house is still getting paid off. I have two kids, one daughter (23F) and one som (25M). Both moved out and are successful in their careers.\n\nA while back, I made a deal with my son to transfer the house over to him. He has been collecting the rent from the tenants and using it to pay off the mortgage. We did not disclose this information to my daughter.\n\nRecently, my wife slipped up and told my daughter our deal. She instantly got angry and isn\u2019t talking to me at the moment. She\u2019s telling me that I am like my father.\n\nShe told me that my son will take that entire house and go for 50% of our main house. She told us that we set her up for failure. The reason why I let my son pay the mortgage because It would help his credit score increase. Her credit score is already 800+. I think she\u2019s being selfish and money hungry.\n\nShe started talking about how i\u2019m the future when we go, she would only get 25% of assets because he gonna go for 50% of everything. She told me that i\u2019m doing exactly what my father did by giving my brother his entire will. \n\nI\u2019m just helping my kids out, It seems like a losing game with her. AITA for giving my son the other house we have?\n\nEdit:\n\nWe have not planned for the main house yet. I do not hate my daughter. If the tenants stopped paying rent, the mortgage would devastate her. She makes 90K in HCOL while son makes 6 figs in LCOL. Mortgage would not devastate him. He does not have low credit either, it\u2019s around 750.\n\nTo reiterate, I do not hate my daughter. I find it more bothersome that she\u2019s thinking about us dying and is already trying to calculate what she\u2019s going to get. Her brother is a very nice guy. I\u2019m sure he would split everything evenly with her.\n\nI have a brother who took everything on my dad\u2019s will. I did not raise my son like that and he has no characteristics of my brother. \n\nEveryone seems to be talking about my son\u2019s credit. It\u2019s over 750", "created_utc": 1702002779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dch0i/aita_for_giving_my_son_25m_a_house_instead_of_my/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why are you giving your son so much more? Why are you punishing your daughter for being financially responsible and maintaining a good credit score. Because as much as you're gonna deny that that's what you're doing, that's exactly what you're doing. That's how she sees it, that's how I see it and that's how the rest of the world will see it.\n\nIf you want to help your son out extra, make him work for it. And no, \"collecting rent\" does not count as work. Make it fair. Give your daughter as much as you give your son because she's done nothing wrong and he's done nothing to deserve preferential treatment.", "If your son has a successful career why does he need to increase his credit score?

If it\u2019s lesser like she is saying, YTA massively. \n\nYou\u2019re also TA because you did this in secret. Any sibling would feel rightly upset that another sibling got AN ENTIRE HOUSE straight off the bat, whereas they get nothing. \n\nYou\u2019re also bailing your son out for his lower credit score, that\u2019s a double blow with the daughter. So bad credit gets you house from daddy, but the good credit score daughter has to fund everything on her own? Far out. Don\u2019t be surprised if she goes NC with you, I would too.\n\nEDIT after reading your edit: YTA YTA YTA. Goddamn, STOP making excuses.", "Yta. How are you helping your daughter? It is your property, and you can do whatever you want with it. But how are you equally helping your daughter? You are ONLY helping your son out, not your \u201ckids\u201d like you posted.\n\nYour son is also not paying the mortgage. The tenants are. Thats what you wrote. So he gets to pocket his salary, and get the house, and 50% of the other house. So he gets 75% and 100% of his salary. Got it.\n\nBecause you wanted him to have a \u201cbetter credit score.\u201d So you punished her for being responsible? You said he has a successful career. So why is he NOT paying his bills to increase his credit score? \n\nYou clearly have a favorite", "Lol, of course YTA. Consider treating your children equally perhaps. \n\nHow is your daughter \u201cmoney hungry\u201d but your son is not? Oh maybe because you gave him an entire house.", "Well you\u2019re certainly not treating your children equally. They\u2019re both adults which means they\u2019re both responsible for their respective credit ratings (unless of course your son\u2019s tanked because of circumstances beyond his control). If you\u2019re going to leave your estate to your children it should be 50/50. So why are you bailing out your seemingly irresponsible child? Smacks of favouritism to me.", "YTA. A house is an enormous asset and I would have considered splitting it with both of your kids instead of just your son. Sure this has helped your son build his credit but the fact that you\u2019ve been hiding this for years from your daughter is a sign that you already know this is fucked up.", "YTA.  This is just blatant favourtism and possibly a dose of sexism in there as well.  Why would you not give them half each?", "She's selfish and money hungry?  Let's see, you gave your son a house and her nothing, did not disclose this transaction, and then are unhappy when she finds out about it, because it has exposed her selfishness and money hunger.  Meanwhile, your son rents out the gifted house, thus covering the mortgage, and his motives are clean as a whistle.  You nailed it, genius, she is a real piece of work to have questioned this.  Face it, her analysis of the long-term financial implications explain why she has the best credit rating.  YTA.", "YTA.\n\nThis is blatant favoritism. You want to give way more to your son, even though they are both \"successful in their careers\". It's not about the money. It's about the fact that you are showing naked, obvious favoritism. Anybody would be hurt by that.\n\nYou can do what you want with your money, but don't be surprised if this ruins your relationship. And 99%+ of outsiders will agree with her.", "INFO: Two questions. \n\n1. At the end you say you are just helping your kids out. How is any of this helping your daughter? I\u2019m not seeing that.

Tell me you have a favorite kid without telling me you have a favorite kid.", "YTA. It's difficult to achieve succession equally, but it must be fair. This is utterly unfair. Why do you think your son deserves so much more than her?", "do you know how you hide something that big for that long? by being deceitful. you deceived your daughter to enrich your son. YTA", "YTA. And I suspect you know that or you wouldn\u2019t have kept everything a secret from your daughter. Your son taking tenant money to pay the mortgage didn\u2019t equal him paying the mortgage to buy the house as is the case in a rent to buy situation since he wasn\u2019t living there. If there were tenants paying rent and getting was paying  the mortgage to buy the property from you, the rent money should have gone into your pocket. There doesn\u2019t seem to me any way around the fact that you are giving your son a house. If you do intend to split remaining assets equally in your will, then your daughter\u2019s calculation that your son essentially is getting a gift equal to the value of the house while she receives nothing and he will receive 50% of your estate. You do seem to be favoring your son, though it is your right to do what you want with your assets. To expect your daughter not to see your favoring your son in this way and not be badly hurt when your choices are promoting the impression to her that she matters less to you is very optimistic of you. I think you can expect this to impact your relationship with your daughter for quite awhile. In fact, no matter what you do now your relationship with her may never recover - she may never be able to forget how she feels right now.", ">I\u2019m just helping my kids out,\n\nNo you're not, you're only helping your son.

YTA for unquestionably favoring your son over your daughter. Double YTA for keeping this a secret from her.", "Obviously, you knew you were wrong as you tried to hide it from her.

You are clearly favouring your son over your daughter. On top of that you have the audacity to come here and ask if you are an AH. Of course you are!", "My parents played favoritism too.

Her credit score is already 800+.\n\nSo you're punishing your daughter for having a good credit score?\n\nDid your daughter also get a house transferred to her, and did you let her collect the rent money from its tenants to pay off the mortgage? No.\n\nYou treat your daughter unfairly. If your son owns the 2nd  house, will your daughter own the house you live in, or will she have to split it 50%? The fact that you don't correct your daughter on this confirms she is correct in her assumption.\n\nIt's clear you don't like your daughter. You and your wife knew it was unfair and wrong, and that's why you tried to keep it a seceet from her.

Whatever the reason, your daughter is absolutely right.", "YTA right now. Just balance that out in a will and show it to her.

The second home should\u2019ve been put in both their names and that way they could decide together what will happen with BOTH houses in the future.  OP must really dislike the fact that his daughter is the responsible one and had to punish her since the son had a poor credit score and she didn\u2019t. It shows that the son will get everything while the daughter has to fend for herself.  How much you want to bet that OP\u2019s retirement plan is his daughter has to take care of them while the son does not.  Then after all the back breaking caregiving she has to split the house the parents are living in with her brother who will probably do nothing and will be too busy and successful to help.

Why are you punishing your daughter for doing something right and have a better credit score? Your daughter has every reason to be upset, and you know it.

You weren\u2019t even going to make sure it was fair by legally documenting who gets what? You do realize the house you *gave* your son already would not be considered as part of his inheritance, and therefore, he would not be under any legal obligation to split any of its value with your daughter, right? So, he would get significantly more! \n\nYou never leave it up to the kindness of someone else (especially one of the inheritors) to equally split your assets after you are dead. Inheritances can bring out the absolute worst in people. You have to write explicitly how you want things split if you really care about being fair to your children. As long as the houses are of roughly equal value, she should get the house you currently live in.

Do the right thing and out your daughter also on title.", "YTA. Think about it from your daughter\u2018s perspective. There\u2018s a secret arrangement that clearly benefits her brother and she only learnt of it by accident. Her bringing up inheritance is in this case not about being money-hungry, but wanting to be treated fairly. You\u2018re not TA for not thinking about this. That\u2018s easily fixable with a will. The fact that you are making her out to be the bad guy and refuse to ensure she gets a fair share of the inheritance one day clearly shows who your favourite child is.", "YTA.

It is your son being selfish by willing to take the house and half of everything else and neither of you are considering your daughter.

YTA and you are exactly like your father", "YTA and this is why (story time): \n\nmy grandmother had two remaining sons who lived very far apart from one another. The opportunity to reaquire a family property came up and one son (who owned a small house already and lived across the country from her) approached her and asked if she would like to buy it for sentimental reasons and he would look after it for her. Of course there was a catch: it was after the 2008 crash and it had to be bought by the future residents, I.e. it would have to be bought in his name. It was. She intended it to be his inheritance. She paid him for the property as well as renovations and he technically bought the house. Sold the first one. \n\nThe second son was to get the house she was living in, which was nearby to him. This house was in her name. He too had a nice house already and was somewhat more financially stable than the first son. \n\nWhen she later wrote her will, the lawyer laughed in her face and told her that she had absolutely no claim to the family property and that her residence would be split 50/50 between the two unless she took immediate measures to change the deed. The solution in this case was to change the deed to transfer upon death, so it automatically went to the second son and was essentially never part of the estate.  \n\nYou have created the exact same situation and will be legally fucking your daughter over unless you do something to clarify and rectify the disparity. Sometimes with wills, things are just legally a certain way and your intentions are irrelevant unless explicitly written by a good estate lawyer.", "Big Asshole, period!!!\nCant you hear your own justification?
