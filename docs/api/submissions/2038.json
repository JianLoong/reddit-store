She began angry and said things like, I bought those cards for you and so on but the thing that really pisses me off is that she bought those cards well over 5 years ago and she didn't care about the cards before this incident. Like I would have gotten a really rare one and she just wouldn't care, but when she learned I could get serious money from that, she was interested. I tried to compromise with her by saying if I buy the pizza now will you pay me back? She no so I said no as well.
