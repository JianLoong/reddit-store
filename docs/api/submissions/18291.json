You suck.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nNot for asking her to be a little more covert (in order to avoid a tiff) but because you\u2019re being controlling and manipulative. She absolutely can do whatever she wants in her own house. She doesn\u2019t HAVE to respect your father\u2019s wishes. And it\u2019s clear, based on your own comments, that you look don\u2019t like that she does so either - which is in your right, if you so choose, but it\u2019s a pretty soft move to use daddy\u2019s respect as a motive to give her shit for it. \n\nYour wife could\u2019ve been a little more flexible with you, but if your dad\u2019s uncomfortable with something she\u2019s doing (something that isn\u2019t inherently wrong, illegal, immoral, and IS given to her by a doctor) then it\u2019s your dad who shouldn\u2019t be coming around.

We are in our late 30s and live in a state where it\u2019s legal. We don\u2019t do it around our parents or when our parents are staying with us. Well, his mom smokes occasionally too, so it\u2019d be ok around her, but NONE of our other parents are like that. Maybe it\u2019s a generational thing. Maybe it\u2019s a parent dynamic thing, like it was an \u201cillegal drug\u201d to be hidden our whole lives. I\u2019m surprised at all the comments that don\u2019t get this.

It doesn't seem like hiding it was the goal here, and to be fair if you smoke in the house there is a 0% chance someone could walk in and not know.

Just go outside hit a weed pen go back to your day. Not difficult.

Sometimes hosts can temporarily forego their own habits and routines to accommodate the comfort of their guests.  It's called hospitality. You offered a compromise and it's still not good enough for your wife.  She sounds very childish and insensitive.  \n\nSorry, OP.  You told her how you feel, that you want to respect your father's comfort in your home, but she doesn't, as she said, her comfort is more important to her.  She's going to do whatever she is going to do but you are not responsible for her actions.", "Yta grow up and deal with your father", "YNTA - it\u2019s a tricky spot that I know I\u2019ve been in before and so have my friends. Sure, it\u2019s her house and she can do what she wants right? But it\u2019s a little different when guests come over. Sure you can walk around naked in your own home if you want, but if you have guests over\u2026maybe that\u2019s not the time lol. Same thing in this situation. And I like weed and am totally fine with it, but a lot of people don\u2019t want to be around smoke/smells to begin with. If your father doesn\u2019t visit all the time where this is a weekly/monthly thing, it\u2019s truly not a big deal for her to respect your wishes for a few days/switch to smokeless options.", "Yta. Can she smoke in your bedroom? Bathroom? Can she tell your Dad that she smokes? You are asking her to change her habits for four days in her home that I'm assuming she helps pay for. Yes I understand wanting to respect YOUR Dad but YOUR Dad doesn't pay for a single daily living expense for your home. She has the right to do what she wants in her own home. Does she have to smoke just tree? Can she hit a pen? Chew on a gummy? Because to me it sounds like the only thing you offered as a compromise was to go outside after your Dad went to sleep.\nMe personally I'd suck it up and go outside but I do understand her point of view which is why do I have to change for what is my environment when you invited someone here? She's tired of hiding a part of who she is. \nBTW you being so judgey about her smoking habits when you admit you smoke as well is gross.", "YTA, her house and she\u2019s grown.

It IS her house and she should be able to do what she wants. No one should be staying there who can\u2019t handle the way you do things in your own home. Did she agree to let your father stay there?", "NTA only because smoking outside is a option honestly it\u2019s fully legal in my state and I choose to smoke it outside so my home is filled with smoke and my partner doesn\u2019t smoke.

Since my father passed, I've been experiencing daily crushing anxiety that usually wakes me up after what is usually too-little sleep (3-4 hours at a time). It can be so bad as to cause dry-heaves or even vomiting. There is a constant band of stress across my chest just below my heart and I frequently suffer indigestion.\n\nMy doctor offered me two choices: a prescription for valium or try CBD pills or edibles; my state no longer requires a prescription for cannabis products. My dad took a daily dose of valium for decades before he passed away, so I was reluctant to use it. So I tried CBD. Guess what? My anxiety faded into background noise, or disappeared entirely.\n\nI usually take one in the morning and am set for the entire day usually. There can be flare ups, but another pill will deal with it. And I'm not getting chemically dependant on it like most anti-anxiety meds.", "Is that not how the relationship between doctors and prescriptions work?

And it sounds like she didn't think so either before the weekend rolled in, if I'm not mistaken? \n\nIt's possible that the act of having to hide or even be discreet with smoking weed brought up some not so great feelings in your wife. Sometimes discretion, whether subtle or extreme, can bring up feelings of shame just by associations in the act itself. So maybe she felt that her normal routine of smoking weed in her home suddenly became something wrong and embarrassing, even though you never said or did anything (I'm assuming) to make her feel that way.\n\nI'm not a user myself, but if weed (prescription or otherwise) is what makes a person feel good and feel like themselves every day, I can understand why being secretive about it in one's own, normally safe, home can be overwhelming. \n\nBut yeah, that whole sentiment of, \"If I can't act however I want, then you're an abusive asshole,\" is not it.", "I get so frustrated every time I see \u201ciT\u2019s NoT AdDiCtIvE\u201d like maybe not physically in the sense of chemical dependence but I absolutely know many people who are deeply psychologically addicted to weed.\n\nAnd I have zero issue with weed and think it should be federally legal!

The issue is that he just said it, with very little discussion, and expected her to feel comfortable and welcome in front of her father-in-law.

Things change.\n\nIt\u2019s stupid to make these black and white juxtapositions to invalidate the fact that with all substance issues, the important point that distinguishes a problem is the amount that qualifies it as excessive. \n\nPeople take caffeine pills, and if they were telling me that they were stressed all day thinking about it, I would assume they have an underlying problem that isn\u2019t a medical necessity.", "Are you telling me the United States has a better medical marijuana system than the UK? This is what we\u2019re better at? Probably because our pharmaceutical companies aren\u2019t heavily involved, but this is low key depressing \ud83d\ude02", "The UK is better at \\*most\\* medications, partially because a board called NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) decides what medications will be available on the NHS, based on stuff like efficacy and value for money. So they may well not deal much with American pharmaceutical companies on that basis. But the government here hasn't changed its thinking much on drugs, especially not ones that are associated with the Afro-Caribbean communities they want to Hostile Environment out of existence, no matter how much place they have as a medical treatment or a part of religious ritual. Summary: \"Black people smoke the weed so the weed is evil\". It's honestly disgusting. (Also this country wants to be more like the US in its health care system, as in \"kill the NHS and then make it too expensive for most people\", so yeah, I don't think this place will be able to lord it over other countries for long. It's pretty high-key depressing if you have to live here.)"]}
