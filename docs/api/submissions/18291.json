AirBnbs exist for a reason and this visit would go a lot better if he were staying somewhere else and visiting with you two during the day, allowing your wife to do her thing at night.", "YTA. I assume you\u2019re a grown ass adult. You\u2019re giving your dad authority over your house just to avoid an uncomfortable conversation. I wonder what other concessions you would be willing to make in order to keep your older, conservative, Christian dad comfortable. \n\nSide-note: A doctor said she needs the weed for anxiety. She\u2019s not smoking the weed and she\u2019s anxious. It\u2019s not rocket science.", "YTA", "NAH.  You want to be private about the weed use and she doesn't.  You both have valid opinions.  You need to find a way to compromise.", "YTA - FOR SURE. Your wife doesn\u2019t need to change her habits for someone else, including you, in her own home. And you\u2019re belittling her mental health. Wow. You suck.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nNot for asking her to be a little more covert (in order to avoid a tiff) but because you\u2019re being controlling and manipulative. She absolutely can do whatever she wants in her own house. She doesn\u2019t HAVE to respect your father\u2019s wishes. And it\u2019s clear, based on your own comments, that you look don\u2019t like that she does so either - which is in your right, if you so choose, but it\u2019s a pretty soft move to use daddy\u2019s respect as a motive to give her shit for it. \n\nYour wife could\u2019ve been a little more flexible with you, but if your dad\u2019s uncomfortable with something she\u2019s doing (something that isn\u2019t inherently wrong, illegal, immoral, and IS given to her by a doctor) then it\u2019s your dad who shouldn\u2019t be coming around. Not her that\u2019s drastically changing her behavior.", "YTA. Stop insulting your wife and putting medically in quotations when you yourself admit to smoking. Figure out a solution, by either getting a vape or something that doesn't smell as much, or fess up to your dad. If he isn't comfortable staying with you, fork up for a hotel.", "YTA. Can't she just go outside?", "YTA- you\u2019re using your dad as an excuse for an action your wife does that bothers you. You\u2019re looking at weed as a drug instead of the medicine your wife uses it as. You have bigger issues than hiding your LEGAL actions from your dad like a teenager.", "Not only are YTA, you are a hypocrite and controlling. Your wife is her own person, she is an adult, she can do what she wants in HER house. Ik this is also your house, but you don't get to control everyone. Sounds like you just like being controlling and judgmental. If your dad, who doesn't live there and doesn't pay the bills doesn't like it you and him both can get a hotel or you can go to his house. If I were her, I wouldn't stay with someone so controlling. Something this insignificant makes me wonder what other aspects of her life you try to control. But after reading your replies, its obvious you don't care, you just want someone to validate you being TA and you are getting mad when people won't. Accept you are TA and stop being so controlling of what a grown woman does.", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say NTA. Now, I do smoke weed fairly regularly, at least a few times a week, sometimes most days of the week. When my wife's parents come to visit, I don't smoke because she's asked me not to. And it's fine, it's only a couple weeks. OP did say he said she can smoke outside and away from his dad, which I think is fair.", "NTA. My partner and I smoke occasionally. We are in our late 30s and live in a state where it\u2019s legal. We don\u2019t do it around our parents or when our parents are staying with us. Well, his mom smokes occasionally too, so it\u2019d be ok around her, but NONE of our other parents are like that. Maybe it\u2019s a generational thing. Maybe it\u2019s a parent dynamic thing, like it was an \u201cillegal drug\u201d to be hidden our whole lives. I\u2019m surprised at all the comments that don\u2019t get this. My Dad is probably most judgmental about drugs and I\u2019d be mad if my partner insisted on doing them with him around when it\u2019s just one weekend.", "NTA because smoking outside was suggested as a compromise, and edibles are available. It doesn't seem like hiding it was the goal here, and to be fair if you smoke in the house there is a 0% chance someone could walk in and not know. There is not enough febreeze in the world.\n\n I think it's a reasonable accommodation to not subject a guest to second hand smoke as a courtesy.", "NTA she sounds like a pia.  she had a problem for each solution. Just go outside hit a weed pen go back to your day. Not difficult. Lots of people keep their weed use private.", "YNTA- there are vapes and edibles to get her through the day and she can smoke when he sleeps. It's literally for 4 days max lol. This is coming from an avid smoker-she's probably having withdrawals and blaming you", "YTA, mostly for how you're acting in the comments.  Grow up.", "NTA.  Sometimes hosts can temporarily forego their own habits and routines to accommodate the comfort of their guests.  It's called hospitality. You offered a compromise and it's still not good enough for your wife.  She sounds very childish and insensitive.  \n\nSorry, OP.  You told her how you feel, that you want to respect your father's comfort in your home, but she doesn't, as she said, her comfort is more important to her.  She's going to do whatever she is going to do but you are not responsible for her actions.", "Yta grow up and deal with your father", "YNTA - it\u2019s a tricky spot that I know I\u2019ve been in before and so have my friends. Sure, it\u2019s her house and she can do what she wants right? But it\u2019s a little different when guests come over. Sure you can walk around naked in your own home if you want, but if you have guests over\u2026maybe that\u2019s not the time lol. Same thing in this situation. And I like weed and am totally fine with it, but a lot of people don\u2019t want to be around smoke/smells to begin with. If your father doesn\u2019t visit all the time where this is a weekly/monthly thing, it\u2019s truly not a big deal for her to respect your wishes for a few days/switch to smokeless options.", "Yta. Can she smoke in your bedroom? Bathroom? Can she tell your Dad that she smokes? You are asking her to change her habits for four days in her home that I'm assuming she helps pay for. Yes I understand wanting to respect YOUR Dad but YOUR Dad doesn't pay for a single daily living expense for your home. She has the right to do what she wants in her own home. Does she have to smoke just tree? Can she hit a pen? Chew on a gummy? Because to me it sounds like the only thing you offered as a compromise was to go outside after your Dad went to sleep.\nMe personally I'd suck it up and go outside but I do understand her point of view which is why do I have to change for what is my environment when you invited someone here? She's tired of hiding a part of who she is. \nBTW you being so judgey about her smoking habits when you admit you smoke as well is gross.", "YTA, her house and she\u2019s grown. I would say, can\u2019t you compromise by using a vape?", "Nta. Why smoke inside the house?", "YTA for how you\u2019re acting in these comments", "YTA. It IS her house and she should be able to do what she wants. No one should be staying there who can\u2019t handle the way you do things in your own home. Did she agree to let your father stay there?", "NTA only because smoking outside is a option honestly it\u2019s fully legal in my state and I choose to smoke it outside so my home is filled with smoke and my partner doesn\u2019t smoke. If you tried tell her she couldn\u2019t at all then that would make you TA", "ESH.

I originally used it as an escape from anxiety and stressful situations but continuous use of it caused me to go into psychosis (no other comorbidities or diagnoses of mental health conditions before or after this incident).

If it's not impacting her life/she can go without it/she can still be productive/she can engage meaningfully in life while using, then fair enough.

It's weird to me that people are calling you the asshole and not even questioning how inconsiderate your wife is of your feelings or your father's feelings.\n\nAnyhow, let the downvotes commence\n\nEdit - just to add, I would have been so paranoid and stressed out if I was high around family members who didn't agree with it so I guess I just can't understand where your wife is coming from at all.", "NTA.
