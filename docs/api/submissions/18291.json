AirBnbs exist for a reason and this visit would go a lot better if he were staying somewhere else and visiting with you two during the day, allowing your wife to do her thing at night.", "YTA. I assume you\u2019re a grown ass adult. You\u2019re giving your dad authority over your house just to avoid an uncomfortable conversation. I wonder what other concessions you would be willing to make in order to keep your older, conservative, Christian dad comfortable. \n\nSide-note: A doctor said she needs the weed for anxiety. She\u2019s not smoking the weed and she\u2019s anxious. It\u2019s not rocket science.", "YTA", "NAH.  You want to be private about the weed use and she doesn't.  You both have valid opinions.  You need to find a way to compromise.", "YTA - FOR SURE. Your wife doesn\u2019t need to change her habits for someone else, including you, in her own home. And you\u2019re belittling her mental health. Wow. You suck.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nNot for asking her to be a little more covert (in order to avoid a tiff) but because you\u2019re being controlling and manipulative. She absolutely can do whatever she wants in her own house. She doesn\u2019t HAVE to respect your father\u2019s wishes. And it\u2019s clear, based on your own comments, that you look don\u2019t like that she does so either - which is in your right, if you so choose, but it\u2019s a pretty soft move to use daddy\u2019s respect as a motive to give her shit for it. \n\nYour wife could\u2019ve been a little more flexible with you, but if your dad\u2019s uncomfortable with something she\u2019s doing (something that isn\u2019t inherently wrong, illegal, immoral, and IS given to her by a doctor) then it\u2019s your dad who shouldn\u2019t be coming around. Not her that\u2019s drastically changing her behavior.", "YTA. Stop insulting your wife and putting medically in quotations when you yourself admit to smoking. Figure out a solution, by either getting a vape or something that doesn't smell as much, or fess up to your dad. If he isn't comfortable staying with you, fork up for a hotel.", "YTA. Can't she just go outside?", "YTA- you\u2019re using your dad as an excuse for an action your wife does that bothers you. You\u2019re looking at weed as a drug instead of the medicine your wife uses it as. You have bigger issues than hiding your LEGAL actions from your dad like a teenager.", "Not only are YTA, you are a hypocrite and controlling. Your wife is her own person, she is an adult, she can do what she wants in HER house. Ik this is also your house, but you don't get to control everyone. Sounds like you just like being controlling and judgmental. If your dad, who doesn't live there and doesn't pay the bills doesn't like it you and him both can get a hotel or you can go to his house. If I were her, I wouldn't stay with someone so controlling. Something this insignificant makes me wonder what other aspects of her life you try to control. But after reading your replies, its obvious you don't care, you just want someone to validate you being TA and you are getting mad when people won't. Accept you are TA and stop being so controlling of what a grown woman does.", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say NTA. Now, I do smoke weed fairly regularly, at least a few times a week, sometimes most days of the week. When my wife's parents come to visit, I don't smoke because she's asked me not to. And it's fine, it's only a couple weeks. OP did say he said she can smoke outside and away from his dad, which I think is fair.", "NTA. My partner and I smoke occasionally. We are in our late 30s and live in a state where it\u2019s legal. We don\u2019t do it around our parents or when our parents are staying with us. Well, his mom smokes occasionally too, so it\u2019d be ok around her, but NONE of our other parents are like that. Maybe it\u2019s a generational thing. Maybe it\u2019s a parent dynamic thing, like it was an \u201cillegal drug\u201d to be hidden our whole lives. I\u2019m surprised at all the comments that don\u2019t get this. My Dad is probably most judgmental about drugs and I\u2019d be mad if my partner insisted on doing them with him around when it\u2019s just one weekend.", "NTA because smoking outside was suggested as a compromise, and edibles are available. It doesn't seem like hiding it was the goal here, and to be fair if you smoke in the house there is a 0% chance someone could walk in and not know. There is not enough febreeze in the world.\n\n I think it's a reasonable accommodation to not subject a guest to second hand smoke as a courtesy.", "NTA she sounds like a pia.  she had a problem for each solution. Just go outside hit a weed pen go back to your day. Not difficult. Lots of people keep their weed use private.", "YNTA- there are vapes and edibles to get her through the day and she can smoke when he sleeps. It's literally for 4 days max lol. This is coming from an avid smoker-she's probably having withdrawals and blaming you", "YTA, mostly for how you're acting in the comments.  Grow up.", "NTA.  Sometimes hosts can temporarily forego their own habits and routines to accommodate the comfort of their guests.  It's called hospitality. You offered a compromise and it's still not good enough for your wife.  She sounds very childish and insensitive.  \n\nSorry, OP.  You told her how you feel, that you want to respect your father's comfort in your home, but she doesn't, as she said, her comfort is more important to her.  She's going to do whatever she is going to do but you are not responsible for her actions.", "Yta grow up and deal with your father", "YNTA - it\u2019s a tricky spot that I know I\u2019ve been in before and so have my friends. Sure, it\u2019s her house and she can do what she wants right? But it\u2019s a little different when guests come over. Sure you can walk around naked in your own home if you want, but if you have guests over\u2026maybe that\u2019s not the time lol. Same thing in this situation. And I like weed and am totally fine with it, but a lot of people don\u2019t want to be around smoke/smells to begin with. If your father doesn\u2019t visit all the time where this is a weekly/monthly thing, it\u2019s truly not a big deal for her to respect your wishes for a few days/switch to smokeless options.", "Yta. Can she smoke in your bedroom? Bathroom? Can she tell your Dad that she smokes? You are asking her to change her habits for four days in her home that I'm assuming she helps pay for. Yes I understand wanting to respect YOUR Dad but YOUR Dad doesn't pay for a single daily living expense for your home. She has the right to do what she wants in her own home. Does she have to smoke just tree? Can she hit a pen? Chew on a gummy? Because to me it sounds like the only thing you offered as a compromise was to go outside after your Dad went to sleep.\nMe personally I'd suck it up and go outside but I do understand her point of view which is why do I have to change for what is my environment when you invited someone here? She's tired of hiding a part of who she is. \nBTW you being so judgey about her smoking habits when you admit you smoke as well is gross.", "YTA, her house and she\u2019s grown. I would say, can\u2019t you compromise by using a vape?", "Nta. Why smoke inside the house?", "YTA for how you\u2019re acting in these comments", "YTA. It IS her house and she should be able to do what she wants. No one should be staying there who can\u2019t handle the way you do things in your own home. Did she agree to let your father stay there?", "NTA only because smoking outside is a option honestly it\u2019s fully legal in my state and I choose to smoke it outside so my home is filled with smoke and my partner doesn\u2019t smoke. If you tried tell her she couldn\u2019t at all then that would make you TA", "ESH.

If it's not impacting her life/she can go without it/she can still be productive/she can engage meaningfully in life while using, then fair enough.

Just because some people can skirt by and get it with some sketchy answers doesn't mean OPs wife is one of them. It just means she's married to an AH who is scared of his daddy as a grown man. Gross. I'd need weed to deal with making such poor marriage choices as well.", "Like any medication taken for prolonged use.\n\nFor example, my ADHD medication. \n\nWhen on it for an extended period of time, I can get my work done efficiently, clean my house when needed, have some peace and quiet in my brain.\n\nWhen I suddenly can't get a refill because of the med shortage, I experience withdrawals. Same thing happens with my anti-depressant. That's just how chemicals work.", "That makes total sense! I am totally pro weed, hell I smoke it myself and much prefer it over alcohol. I just think the \u201cweed isn\u2019t addictive\u201d talk is totally false and in fact harmful.", "Maybe next time take Dad on a guys trip somewhere so you can have your visit without dictating what your wife is able to do in her own home. YTA.", "I'm hung up on this guys hypocrisy so I asked questions. I'm not going to make assumptions about his wife from the doublespeak he has littered these comments with.", "It\u2019s almost like she does actually have anxiety and stress and it\u2019s you who is the liar.", "Why doesn\u2019t that apply to your dad? Me me me I don\u2019t like weed so when I go stay at your house you\u2019re not allowed to do it", "You're also assuming she had a choice in whether or not the dad was invited over. I've met more than a few Christian Conservative fathers who just assumed they would be, invited themselves and then shit stain boys who think they are men immediately cave rather than having any sort of conversation with dad. ... Not saying the OP is like that, but nothing I saw said that the wife was actually in agreement with the guest. I also see where OP asked the wife not to smoke ... but no where that the wife agreed to give up her comfort in her own house.", "Couldn't be that she didn't want to agree in the first place? I see so much misogyny that it's hard to not see it anymore.\n\nYou continue to live as you will but realize your own actions for what they are.", "Yes, but you can safely drive and responsibly work after a cup of coffee. You definitely shouldn't drive and probably shouldn't show up to work stoned just because your \"true self\" is always intoxicated", "Ya that kinda proves the point you have an addiction.", "This is the way.", "Absolutely! I used to be on medication for my adhd and smoking curbed the sluggishness I experienced and now off medications smoking is one of the few things that helps me focus and do tasks in an organized manner that isn't an arm and a leg with a copay. Weed is more obtainable than most medications people who need them, take.", "This is exactly right. I tried so many medications that didn't work, or who's side effects were horrible. Very few people exist without some chemical alterations to their brain. The stigma about some drugs is astonishing.", "- do not compare alcohol to weed. It is not comparable.\n\n- you don't get high everytime you smoke. People that are using it to function daily not only have a tolerance, but are not typically smoking huge blunts in one sitting. A hit or two off a bowl for pain and anxiety isn't going to interfere with your job. If it does, **it's not the right medication for you** And it's your job to be looking for something that DOES medicate you.\n\nETA: I thought we were talking about people with medical marijuana licenses. That's not self medicating.", "this is a very ignorant take in every way possible.", "I have no official diagnosis and a multitude of symptoms. A prescibed drug for ADHD is exacerbating bi-polar symptoms!  \nThey targeted Marijuana back in the 80s to elevate pharmaceutical sales.  The war on drugs indeed.", "I don't have a problem with weed, I'm just explaining that these rubber stampers in particular don't listen to you much", "My older brother has add and they tried to put him on lithium at 9!! Before I was born mind but they fought my mom so hard about it she had to switch doctors and therapists. My mom was a nurse who had seen grown adults addicted to lithium (its also an anti anxiety if you take it with a booster like abilify) after being on it for less than the trial period of 30 days", "In my state, they at one point had to force everyone to reapply for medical Marijuana because anyone could get it if they wanted to. It's recreational now so that isn't an issue but it was a big deal at the time", "Oh please.  \u201cMedical marijuana\u201d is a scam.  No one is refused a prescription.  \n\nJust make it legal already.", "You can get it privately (ie. Not on the NHS). Apparently 6000 people are being prescribed it which is in incredibly small number, but maybe you can find a private doctor to prescribe?", "I agree.  I still smoke, too, I just use it the way I would feel comfortable using alcohol if I drank.", "Then why did she have a meltdown when OP asked her not to smoke in the house for a few days?", "This better be soaked with sarcasm.  Please God let it be.", "Let people cope", "And my only other \"street drug free\" thing that works for me is either not sleeping for days and getting everything done in that hazy period before your body crashes but is so full of jittery energy, or sleeping for hours and hours and hours and then doing all my shit very rushed in the 40 minutes of post sleep serotonin that wore off too quickly and left me tired again.", "I'm just saying the rubber stampers aren't only handing out weed", "This was my experience in a state where they're VERY restrictive on who can get a medical card. Green Doctors know what makes them money, and they'll make sure you get your card as long as you can answer the questions with their not so subtle coaching. I have a chronic condition that automatically qualifies me, but both networks I've gone through (switched who I re-upped my prescription with last time around) have sent me to doctors that will just tell you what symptoms you're probably experiencing, and present it like \"....and you more than likely have terrible headaches, neck pain, and anxiety from the pain, riiiiiight?\"  \n\nI've never felt more like I was a party to some type of fraud, lol. Just seemed skeezy.", "I've looked into it, but it's a cost issue. Private GPs are costly, and private prescription charges were insane five years ago so I doubt they're better now. Having it available privately only isn't much different than not being available at all in this economy.", "That's literally untrue. It can be taken either when needed or as a regular medication.\n\nSimilar to ADHD medications.\n\nI am on both anti-anxiety meds and ADHD meds. \n\nDon't talk about things you don't know about, please !", "Why?", "I'm not entirely sure that you are the asshole for this specific situation but, judging by your comments, you certainly are one in general.", "Seriously. Bunch of squares.", "I agree completely but completely separate from any addiction or drug use rhetoric, the \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me until coffee\u201d people are annoying as hell. Have some at home then, whiny ass children.", "So you don't drive, and you're allowed to show up to work high?", "Yea that totally sucks. I can\u2019t imagine how frustrating it is for you knowing that there\u2019s something out there that can help but you can\u2019t access it", "I know everything about it. You\u2019re in denial.", "Bc what you said was absolutely fkn ridiculous.", "I'm sure you were asking to be a shit but you're correct actually. I'm lucky enough to live where I don't really have to drive. My job, stores, etc are all within 15 or 20 minutes and it's never bothered me to walk. I have a license and don't drive while high bc I'm in general easily distracted. And I am allowed to be high on the job. Not every job cares. My boss smokes. As does hers. And before you ask, no I don't work fast food. I'm in customer service, hotel representative at the moment.", "https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Treatments/Mental-Health-Medications/Types-of-Medication/Alprazolam-(Xanax)#:~:text=Alprazolam%20may%20be%20taken%20every,you%20based%20upon%20your%20response.", "NTA if she has the option to smoke outside. It\u2019s common courtesy to do so when having guests.", "Bro does not respect his wife at all. I can\u2019t imagine dismissing my wife\u2019s anxiety like this just for daddy", "No. A hypocrite is a grown ass man who smokes weed but when daddy shows up becomes Pat fuckin Robertson. It must be embarrassing as hell having to face your wife after all that \u201cyes sir daddy sir\u201d shit.", "\"your comment ist dumb\"\n\"Why\"\n\"Cause its stupid.\"\n\nOk enjoy your day there ist No reason To Care for your opinion.", "People can do whatever the f*ck they want in their own house and shouldn\u2019t have to worry what their SO thinks", "And to take it further, the state even knows I smoke. When I gave birth 2 years ago I was asked if I'd ever smoked and I was honest about it. Cps came to my place after taking my kid home and only cared that my stuff could be/was locked up. People don't care about weed anymore when there is way worse shit out there and more heavily abused, like coke.", "You sound like a broken record. You don't know any of those people so maybe for one second stop making assumptions and calm down.", "Run to your safe space and whatever you do hold onto your weed!!!!", "Right? OP is cracking me up with his crazy reasoning!"]}
