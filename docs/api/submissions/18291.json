AirBnbs exist for a reason and this visit would go a lot better if he were staying somewhere else and visiting with you two during the day, allowing your wife to do her thing at night.", "YTA. I assume you\u2019re a grown ass adult. You\u2019re giving your dad authority over your house just to avoid an uncomfortable conversation. I wonder what other concessions you would be willing to make in order to keep your older, conservative, Christian dad comfortable. \n\nSide-note: A doctor said she needs the weed for anxiety. She\u2019s not smoking the weed and she\u2019s anxious. It\u2019s not rocket science.", "YTA", "NAH.  You want to be private about the weed use and she doesn't.  You both have valid opinions.  You need to find a way to compromise.", "YTA - FOR SURE. Your wife doesn\u2019t need to change her habits for someone else, including you, in her own home. And you\u2019re belittling her mental health. Wow. You suck.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nNot for asking her to be a little more covert (in order to avoid a tiff) but because you\u2019re being controlling and manipulative. She absolutely can do whatever she wants in her own house. She doesn\u2019t HAVE to respect your father\u2019s wishes. And it\u2019s clear, based on your own comments, that you look don\u2019t like that she does so either - which is in your right, if you so choose, but it\u2019s a pretty soft move to use daddy\u2019s respect as a motive to give her shit for it. \n\nYour wife could\u2019ve been a little more flexible with you, but if your dad\u2019s uncomfortable with something she\u2019s doing (something that isn\u2019t inherently wrong, illegal, immoral, and IS given to her by a doctor) then it\u2019s your dad who shouldn\u2019t be coming around. Not her that\u2019s drastically changing her behavior.", "YTA. Stop insulting your wife and putting medically in quotations when you yourself admit to smoking. Figure out a solution, by either getting a vape or something that doesn't smell as much, or fess up to your dad. If he isn't comfortable staying with you, fork up for a hotel.", "YTA. Can't she just go outside?", "YTA- you\u2019re using your dad as an excuse for an action your wife does that bothers you. You\u2019re looking at weed as a drug instead of the medicine your wife uses it as. You have bigger issues than hiding your LEGAL actions from your dad like a teenager.", "Not only are YTA, you are a hypocrite and controlling. Your wife is her own person, she is an adult, she can do what she wants in HER house. Ik this is also your house, but you don't get to control everyone. Sounds like you just like being controlling and judgmental. If your dad, who doesn't live there and doesn't pay the bills doesn't like it you and him both can get a hotel or you can go to his house. If I were her, I wouldn't stay with someone so controlling. Something this insignificant makes me wonder what other aspects of her life you try to control. But after reading your replies, its obvious you don't care, you just want someone to validate you being TA and you are getting mad when people won't. Accept you are TA and stop being so controlling of what a grown woman does.", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say NTA. Now, I do smoke weed fairly regularly, at least a few times a week, sometimes most days of the week. When my wife's parents come to visit, I don't smoke because she's asked me not to. And it's fine, it's only a couple weeks. OP did say he said she can smoke outside and away from his dad, which I think is fair.", "NTA. My partner and I smoke occasionally. We are in our late 30s and live in a state where it\u2019s legal. We don\u2019t do it around our parents or when our parents are staying with us. Well, his mom smokes occasionally too, so it\u2019d be ok around her, but NONE of our other parents are like that. Maybe it\u2019s a generational thing. Maybe it\u2019s a parent dynamic thing, like it was an \u201cillegal drug\u201d to be hidden our whole lives. I\u2019m surprised at all the comments that don\u2019t get this. My Dad is probably most judgmental about drugs and I\u2019d be mad if my partner insisted on doing them with him around when it\u2019s just one weekend.", "NTA because smoking outside was suggested as a compromise, and edibles are available. It doesn't seem like hiding it was the goal here, and to be fair if you smoke in the house there is a 0% chance someone could walk in and not know. There is not enough febreeze in the world.\n\n I think it's a reasonable accommodation to not subject a guest to second hand smoke as a courtesy.", "NTA she sounds like a pia.  she had a problem for each solution. Just go outside hit a weed pen go back to your day. Not difficult. Lots of people keep their weed use private.", "YNTA- there are vapes and edibles to get her through the day and she can smoke when he sleeps. It's literally for 4 days max lol. This is coming from an avid smoker-she's probably having withdrawals and blaming you", "YTA, mostly for how you're acting in the comments.  Grow up.", "NTA.  Sometimes hosts can temporarily forego their own habits and routines to accommodate the comfort of their guests.  It's called hospitality. You offered a compromise and it's still not good enough for your wife.  She sounds very childish and insensitive.  \n\nSorry, OP.  You told her how you feel, that you want to respect your father's comfort in your home, but she doesn't, as she said, her comfort is more important to her.  She's going to do whatever she is going to do but you are not responsible for her actions.", "Yta grow up and deal with your father", "YNTA - it\u2019s a tricky spot that I know I\u2019ve been in before and so have my friends. Sure, it\u2019s her house and she can do what she wants right? But it\u2019s a little different when guests come over. Sure you can walk around naked in your own home if you want, but if you have guests over\u2026maybe that\u2019s not the time lol. Same thing in this situation. And I like weed and am totally fine with it, but a lot of people don\u2019t want to be around smoke/smells to begin with. If your father doesn\u2019t visit all the time where this is a weekly/monthly thing, it\u2019s truly not a big deal for her to respect your wishes for a few days/switch to smokeless options.", "Yta. Can she smoke in your bedroom? Bathroom? Can she tell your Dad that she smokes? You are asking her to change her habits for four days in her home that I'm assuming she helps pay for. Yes I understand wanting to respect YOUR Dad but YOUR Dad doesn't pay for a single daily living expense for your home. She has the right to do what she wants in her own home. Does she have to smoke just tree? Can she hit a pen? Chew on a gummy? Because to me it sounds like the only thing you offered as a compromise was to go outside after your Dad went to sleep.\nMe personally I'd suck it up and go outside but I do understand her point of view which is why do I have to change for what is my environment when you invited someone here? She's tired of hiding a part of who she is. \nBTW you being so judgey about her smoking habits when you admit you smoke as well is gross.", "YTA, her house and she\u2019s grown. I would say, can\u2019t you compromise by using a vape?", "Nta. Why smoke inside the house?", "YTA for how you\u2019re acting in these comments", "YTA. It IS her house and she should be able to do what she wants. No one should be staying there who can\u2019t handle the way you do things in your own home. Did she agree to let your father stay there?", "NTA only because smoking outside is a option honestly it\u2019s fully legal in my state and I choose to smoke it outside so my home is filled with smoke and my partner doesn\u2019t smoke. If you tried tell her she couldn\u2019t at all then that would make you TA", "ESH.

I was taught to have respect for my elders (of course within reason - not sexual predators or right out assholes obvi).\n\nHiding weed from someone is not like hiding sexuality from someone and to equate the two is kind of outright gross.\n\nIn one instance you are born that way, the other is a drug that you can choose to partake in or not. I am failing to see how the two are related.", "I\u2019m not arguing. I\u2019m adding context for people that are ignorant of the problem.\n\nAnd yeah, like this is my post? It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m in someone else\u2019s post making it all about me?", "I\u2019m not asking her to lie - never did.", "Never forbid her to smoke in the house - just in front of my father.", "I\u2019m not scared of daddy. He knows I smoke - he just doesn\u2019t like it. \n\nShe has stopped before but can\u2019t now. Things change over time? Do you want me to explain time to you?", "Maybe I didn\u2019t realize it was until I posted? Maybe I thought the problem was different before I posted and now I am looking at it different having conversations with different people.\n\nWow conversation changes peoples mind! Who would have thought!!!!!!", "Maybe if you took \"medically\" out of quotes...", "Also, I'm done troll. Have a nice night. Stop being such a hypocrite.", "Lemme guess... you don't believe cannabis has any medical use at all.", "PAY FOR A HOTEL AND FUCK OFF. DONE.", "But paying 100s of thousands of dollars has no meaning because dear daddy in law can't stay at the holiday inn... sorry, I side with the wife.", "I was taught that respect is earned through actions and behavior, not time spent on this planet. \n\nTo your second point: \n\n>Don\u2019t do that in front of my conservative religious parent, it will upset them. \n\nNot exactly a slippery slope.", "Respect your elders, but also get with the program boomer. It's not the 1940s anymore. It's weed, it's like having a drink. Should you stop having a glass of wine cause of your dad. He doesn't have to smoke it so there's really no problem. \n\nIf he despises weed so much the thought of anyone smoking it while he's around drives him crazy, then she's right. Your not being true to yourself. Be like your wife and have the balls to be a man and say hey dad, I do this, your going to have to deal with the fact that I do", "No one is ignorant of the problem. Everyone can read your comments. You don't need to repeat the same answer over and over and over again. \n\n>And yeah, like this is my post? It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m in someone else\u2019s post making it all about me?\n\nAaaaand you've completely missed the point, again. The way you're arguing with everyone and insisting that you are right is \"me me me.\"\n\nI also can't help but notice that every time someone mentions that you and your wife are grown adults living in your own home and she wants to comfortably live in her own home, you completely ignore it. But the second anyone mentions weed use, you are locked and loaded with all of your articles about weed use as though *that's* the actual issue here.", "Oh,  so you explained to your Dad that you both smoke weed and your wife is feeling a little off because you've asked her to hide it??\n\nDoes your father know you both smoke it??  If he doesn't,  then you're lying and asking her to.", "I feel like maybe your wife wasn\u2019t keen on the idea of your father staying at your place in the first place and it\u2019s impacting her willingness to not smoke indoors.", "Who cares what he likes or doesn't like? It's your house and you're a grown ass adult, start acting like it", "Because this wasn\u2019t really a medical situation. I do think that weed has medical benefits. Anything in moderation. But the problem is over use and not being able to stop.", "Wouldn\u2019t a hypocrite be me smoking in front of my father when I told her not to. Words have meaning. Learn them.", "Nope. I do. But I think overuse of it can become a crutch. Oxycodone is also a medicine that we take. Should we take it every day?", "I don\u2019t disagree and this may be the solution moving forward. But it is just wild to me that someone can\u2019t stop something for a few days but IATA.\n\nI am not asking her to be taken of insulin but Jesus sure seems like it.", "Why are you acting like the dad has anything to do with this?  From what I have gathered the only thing he is doing is accepting an invite to stay in the op's home.", "I didn\u2019t argue with everyone! I actually thanked a commenter for their insight.", "He knows - he doesn\u2019t like the smell or the smoke.", "Because weed isn\u2019t legal in his state and he doesn\u2019t view it in a positive light? This truly is what is wrong about the world rn. The I can do whatever the fuck I want attitude no matter how it affects other people.", "Yes, because having your in laws over doesn't induce anxiety in anyway... PFFF WTF WAS I THINKING!!", "No quite? But whatever helps you feel better about it \ud83d\udc4d", "You can OD and die from Oxy. Comparing the two is idiotic.", "Actually, this is a good point. Let's for a second (God forbid!) assume your wife does have anxiety. Would you want her to stop taking medication for it? I mean, just so the visit with your dad is actually enjoyable?\n\nWould you ask someone with high blood pressure to stop taking their meds? Like your original example, someone with diabetes to stop take their insulin/metformin? No, you wouldn't. So maybe for 1 second, actually accept your wife actually does have anxiety. STOP MINIMIZING THAT! You really gonna make her SUFFER?", "I wasn't? I was assuming that OP wouldn't allow such an atrocity.", "The problem is OP won\u2019t address the questions about whether the wife agreed to invite the father to stay.", "Really because in your post you said the problem is he doesn\u2019t like drug use. Which is it?", "So how would your wife smoking affect other people then? Safe bet that she wouldn\u2019t go up and blow smoke in your trump-humper dad\u2019s face. So please elaborate", "He\u2019s a grown ass man. He should either be able to deal with it or get a hotel.", "Except for it doesn't effect your dad in anyway.\n\nI think your 'caring more about my dad than I do my wife' attitude is *actually* what's wrong.", "Lol honestly my dad\u2019s favorite thing to do is to take walks. He probably talks 5% of the time he is here and him and my wife love each other (besides the weed part) but keep acting as if you know more about the situation than I do!", "So your stance is fk my spouse, it's my house and I'll do what I want to do.  Ok."]}
