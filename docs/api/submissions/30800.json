Julie still has her job, but doesn't want to go through the ordeal of getting a new apartment while dealing with her STBX, and we didn't want her to have to stay in the hotel during that.\n\nI'm Indian, and Alex and the rest of his family are white, I feel like that may be relevant to what happened here.\n\nI use oils for most of my hair and skin care,  I also use chemically manufactured products, but I found that it's better for my hair and skin.  That's also how my mother cared for me when I was younger.\n\nJulie disapproves of this and thinks that I'm just going around town an oily and greasy mess,  despite me repeatedly explaining why I do this to her.  She's tried to convince me to switch to all chemical products she uses, but I politely decline each time.\n\nWhen I woke up today after sleeping in with Alex, I walked into our shared bathroom and saw the case of my oils was not there. I looked further around the bathroom to see where it could be and asked my husband if he had moved it.  Alex said no, and that's when I went into the living room and asked Julie about the case.\n\nJulie gave me a smirk and told me that she had woken up early this morning and took my case out of the bathroom to drive to the other side of the community we live in and dump it into the garbage bin there.  I was tired and thought she was joking until Julie bragged about it, saying that she did me a favor and that I wouldn't have to use such uncivilized ways of taking care of myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce her words sunk in,  I was pissed and called Alex into the room to explain to him what she did. Alex seemed disappointed, but not surprised about what Julie did and told her what she did was disrespectful.\n\nJulie tried to defend herself, saying that she only did what she thought was best, and it shouldn't be such a big deal.  I cut her off, saying that I wanted her to give me 76$ which was the cost of the oils so I could replace them.\n\nJulie got nervous and said she was in a tight spot financially so she couldn't pay me back right away. I said that was fine, but I expected her to pay me at some point.\n\nAfter a small back and forth Julie eventually packed a bag and said she'd be staying in a hotel to give me time to cool down and realize how irrational I was being.\n\nA few hours later, my MIL and FIL scolded me for making Julie uncomfortable in my home and that I shouldn't force her to pay for something so small.  My husband asked his mom how she'd feel if Julie tossed out the hundreds of dollars of skincare she owned because Julie thought it wasn't good for her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy MIL just replied with \" That's different.\" before telling us that I should apologize and then hanging up.\n\nEdit: My MIL and FIL are paying for Julie's hotel and apparently are going to do so until she comes back to our house.

Rephrase it to your husband and his family that Julie's actions are coming across as racist, since this is your cultural way of managing your hygiene and it'd be no different than throwing out a black woman's silk bonnet or complaining about coconut oil.

There is no reason that Julie should every be permitted back in your home.   It's your home and she's made *you* uncomfortable with her unacceptable boundary stomping.   \n\nThis is not a trivial issue.  The money is a side issue.

Julie should go live with them.", "NTA\n\nThis reeks of racist BS, both from your SIL and MIL.\n\nYou need to draw a hard, and firm boundary and get your husband on board. SIL doesn't get to come back until she has apologised AND paid the money back in full. She needs to understand that her actions are unacceptable, and so do your inlaws.\n\nI say this because what happens if you and your husband want to have children. Will they disapprove and undermine your cultural traditions with your child? How will they treat your family when they come to stay?

Beautician? How does she know what products are good or bad for you? And what gives her the right to dictate it in YOUR house of all places?

Julie still has her job, but doesn't want to go through the ordeal of getting a new apartment while dealing with her STBX, and we didn't want her to have to stay in the hotel during that.\n\nI'm Indian, and Alex and the rest of his family are white, I feel like that may be relevant to what happened here.\n\nI use oils for most of my hair and skin care,  I also use chemically manufactured products, but I found that it's better for my hair and skin.  That's also how my mother cared for me when I was younger.\n\nJulie disapproves of this and thinks that I'm just going around town an oily and greasy mess,  despite me repeatedly explaining why I do this to her.  She's tried to convince me to switch to all chemical products she uses, but I politely decline each time.\n\nWhen I woke up today after sleeping in with Alex, I walked into our shared bathroom and saw the case of my oils was not there. I looked further around the bathroom to see where it could be and asked my husband if he had moved it.  Alex said no, and that's when I went into the living room and asked Julie about the case.\n\nJulie gave me a smirk and told me that she had woken up early this morning and took my case out of the bathroom to drive to the other side of the community we live in and dump it into the garbage bin there.  I was tired and thought she was joking until Julie bragged about it, saying that she did me a favor and that I wouldn't have to use such uncivilized ways of taking care of myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce her words sunk in,  I was pissed and called Alex into the room to explain to him what she did. Alex seemed disappointed, but not surprised about what Julie did and told her what she did was disrespectful.\n\nJulie tried to defend herself, saying that she only did what she thought was best, and it shouldn't be such a big deal.  I cut her off, saying that I wanted her to give me 76$ which was the cost of the oils so I could replace them.\n\nJulie got nervous and said she was in a tight spot financially so she couldn't pay me back right away. I said that was fine, but I expected her to pay me at some point.\n\nAfter a small back and forth Julie eventually packed a bag and said she'd be staying in a hotel to give me time to cool down and realize how irrational I was being.\n\nA few hours later, my MIL and FIL scolded me for making Julie uncomfortable in my home and that I shouldn't force her to pay for something so small.  My husband asked his mom how she'd feel if Julie tossed out the hundreds of dollars of skincare she owned because Julie thought it wasn't good for her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy MIL just replied with \" That's different.\" before telling us that I should apologize and then hanging up.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
