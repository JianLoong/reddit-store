Most gym treadmills are commercial grade & believe it or not, but commercial grade exercise equipment (with electronic components at least) tend to be more prone to problems than most home consumer (residential use) treadmills.\n\nA homeowner could use a treadmill they purchased locally (or online - any home consumer / residential use treadmill) for a coat rack for years, then uncover it & dust it off one day years later & it find that it works like new.

Unless she made sure to distribute the weight of the bag evenly across the bar & on the treadmill as a whole, she was likely causing damage to the treadmill.\n\nTreadmills are made to have weight (even large amounts of weight) on them - but EVENLY distributed. No one uses a treadmill by placing their weight on one bar/side only. Doing so would be detrimental to the device - causing it to require repairs quicker & more often, as well as leading to a decrease in the overall useful life of the treadmill. Neither owners/managers NOR members want that.\n\nShe was abusing the equipment. Not only were you completely correct to call her on it - you should notify the gym manager/owner as well.

I wasn\u2019t aware of the near impossibility of canceling a membership.", "if it's not staffed how can they enforce the \"no bags on the gym floor\" policy?", "Your husband is a very lucky dude", "I was with you until the pibble stereotype. Those sweet dogs don't deserve the slander.", "You might need to hire your services out. I can see a market in gym membership cancellations, repair shop overcharging, health care billing issues...", "It\u2019s because people sign up for reasons like New Year\u2019s resolutions and don\u2019t have a plan or aren\u2019t actually committed to their goals and the industry is designed to feed on that. \n\nNobody should join a gym for any reason other than personal improvement in whatever shape that takes form, and gyms should be month to month memberships but I\u2019m nobody and these are just opinions.", "How anti-capitalistic is that? Why should a business not be able to charge you forever even if you no longer can make use of their services.\n\n/s", "Most gyms are like high school lockers and are day use only. Use a lock or don\u2019t, your choice! I generally only leave anything if value in a locker for 5 minutes while I take a shower so I don\u2019t bother with a lock. If you\u2019d like to steal my towel and change of clothes, be my guest.", "Send them a cancellation letter then give a copy to your credit card company while disputing the charge. Membership gets canceled real fast.", "i'm not american, so i have no idea what US high school lockers are like. my school's lockers used keys.", "I've heard of people's family members dying who have a planet fitness membership and the gym won't let other family members cancel the membership because the member has to come in person to do it. It's ridiculous", "Just super protective. My husband raised pitty\u2019s for quite awhile"]}
