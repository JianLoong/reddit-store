I'd have reported this to the the staff at the gym. The gym i visit is really good at handling stuff like this. \nA few months ago I was working out on one of the only bikes that has back support. I had my headphones on an music blasting when I felt a tap on my shoulder which scared the living ahit out of me. This lady wanted to know if I was nearly done. The timer clearly showed I'd been on there for about 5 minutes, I told her I'd be about another 10 but she continued to loiter over my shoulder while I carried on with my workout.
