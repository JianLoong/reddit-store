So many comments said it well, it was a childhood relationship he was never able to escape cause his family kept choosing you over him. That's gotta hurt. Just cause you doesn't feel the tension doesn't mean it's not there. And just cause your home life wasn't good doesn't mean you're doing the right thing by swooping in on his family. Thats extremely selfish of you. His fiancee could've acted with a little more tact but you need to understand, she's getting her information from him so he's obviously never been as ok with it as he said. How could he really ever voice that though if he knows his own family who's supposed to love and care for him keep choosing the girl he dated as a child.

And you believing that they would choose you over Max is extremely naive. I understand not having a family of your own and wanting that connection but you're doing yourself a disservice by sticking around. Max is has moved on and is getting married , the dynamics are going to shift eventually. What if Max and his new lady start having kids? You're going to play the auntie role? You're gonna go to the wedding? Spend holidays with them? It's honestly kind of weird lol", "At first I was leaning toward N T A, but with some sympathy for Cindy's having to deal with this unusual situation despite her poor way of handling it, and some blame on Max for not properly preparing Cindy for the situation. But then as I read OP's followup comments elsewhere in the thread, and re-read the OP's original post, I began more and more to feel for Max. OP buried the lede when she said the parents' embracing of her after the breakup \"caused some issues with Max.\" Her comment \"I have talk to max before we had a heart to heart when I moved in and I thought we were good\" sounds like everything was hunky-dory for Max until you think about the whole situation:\n\nMax and OP dated as teenagers for a year. Then they broke up. Then after they broke up, OP's parents kicked her out, so Max's parents invited her to move in.\n\nIt's one thing to like your teenage son's girlfriend, to be friendly with her even after a breakup, and to be concerned and want to make sure she's okay when you find out her parents abandoned her, just like you might with any young person you hear about going through hard times. But having a bond with your son's girlfriend after one year of a high school romance is not normal, that's being too involved in your son's romantic life. Inviting your teenage son's ex-girlfriend to come live with you is not an appropriate action to take, it's bound to cause issues, as OP herself says it did.\n\nOP glosses over those issues, talking about one heart-to-heart she had with Max when she moved in when they were both still in high school. Honestly, Max, seeing how oblivious his parents were being to his comfort level, probably just resigned himself to the fact that he couldn't change the situation, and thought he only had to tough it out for another year before he went off to college, so decided to grin and bear it. It likely wouldn't have occurred to him in his wildest dreams that 10 years later a girl he dated for 12 months in high school would be more enmeshed with his family than ever, and that he'd have to be explaining this bizarre situation to the woman he is marrying.\n\nMax's parents are major AHs for not having healthy boundaries all those years ago, for completely disregarding their own son's feelings for someone who should have been no more than a friendly acquaintance to them at that point. They compounded that initial mistake of letting her stay temporarily by crossing the line beyond providing emergency shelter for a teen for one year, and allowing an attachment to grow that was problematic given their son's previous relationship with OP. They have continued to encourage this relationship, let it grow even closer as the years have gone on (OP says she has been going to family events \"for a few years now\"), without stopping to consider how this might impact their son's ability to bring new women in his life around his family.\n\nMax's sisters, I'm mostly going to let off the hook, because they were just following their parents lead and didn't know any better.\n\nCindy shouldn't have confronted you directly, she should have let Max take the lead on any confrontation that needed to happen with you and his family, but I have a lot of sympathy for her, it's not at all unreasonable for her to be suspicious about why you are still hanging around you high school boyfriend of one year 10 years ago's family, and also the message Max's parents are sending to her (or any woman Max would bring home) by continuing to embrace Max's ex as their \"daughter\", one would almost wonder if THEY still wish you and Max were together in Cindy's shoes. So, I'm going to say Cindy acted poorly at the birthday party, but over all, she's not an AH.\n\nI don't think you're quite as much of an AH as Max's parents, because they were the adults who encouraged this unhealthy situation back when you were too young to know better and in a vulnerable position, but now that you're 27, you should have the maturity and perspective to recognize that a.) a 27 year old does not need to be adopted, and b.) Max's family can still be close friends, but they are not, in fact, your family, and you need to step back a little and allow Max the room he needs in his family to bring the woman who will be his life into it.  Despite OP's attempt to frame this as Cindy trying to horn in and usurp OP's \"rightful place\" in \"her family\", it's really more about Max's parents and OP elbowing Max out of his rightful place in the family, his ability to grow up and live his wife and join his new family to his family of origin without ghosts of high school girlfriends past haunting him and his wife for the rest of his life.

It can be tough to be around your  husband's ex, however, you've been part of this family for longer than she has, she really should have dealt with her jealousy by now.

His family shouldn't have to chose.", "I hope you see the comments and update.\n\nFirst of all, before all that, its fucking weird your family would bond so deeply and completely with someone you date in high school for a year, especially if it seems like they had no established relationship before. How one heart to heart is not sufficient for anybody, let alone a teenager to be ok with something like this. I also find the vague possibility in the post that they seemed way more welcoming to Max's high school GF over the person he's marrying.\n\nNow if you look at some of the most recent comments, you get stuff like this:\n\n>I am actually really confident they would chose me if they were forced, because if they disowned me they would cause problem with all the other kids ( three daughters) who considers me their family also. My sisters would raise hell and probably would go low/ no contact with their parents.I also highly doubt it would come to that in the first place. But if they were forced it would be more pick between their son or four other people ( me and sisters)\n\nOP seems completely unconcerned with Max's status in his own family. She basically usurped his family and doesn't give a shit about mending the relationship or being concerned that she's a major player in his alienation for all this time.\n\nAt the very least, things are not as easy and straightforward as OP made the post sound. There are a lot of complications and profound fuckery imbedded deep in their family dynamics.", "I don't know, I would say maybe a wee bit of an AH.\n\n>I am actually really confident they would chose me if they were forced, because if they disowned me they would cause problem with all the other kids ( three daughters) who considers me their family also.

Yes his partner acted shitty but it feels like so did everyone else around him. \n\n\nI empathize that OP was in a bad spot and it was very kind of Max's parents to take you in after the breakup. But with that said I would never in a million years do that to my kid, even if my kid was wrong and the reason for the breakup. That's my kid, am I really going to have their ex in my house and pretend they can be siblings? Everyone is acting like it's all resolved, but it just seems like Max has to accept the circumstances if he wants a relationship with his family. The circumstance is fucking weird for anyone that he dates, which is clearly manifesting itself now. He really has to explain to any potential partner that his ex is part of the family and they'd choose her over him so if he wants contact with his family he and anyone he dates has to accept the ex. \n\n\n\n\nOP has stated that if push came to shove they family would choose her over Max. His 3 sisters would not accept OP not being a part of the family. I don't give a shit what anyone says, dude had his family stolen by his ex girlfriend and is now in this weird fucked up scenario that he can't get out of without abandoning his family. He signed up to date a teenage girl as a teenager himself, not tied to this person for the rest of his life. \n\n\n\nESH except Max. The damage is done, you've irreparably damaged the relationship this random guy you dated as a kid had with his family.

I bet OP would go ballistic if the roles were reversed. She chose to punish her high school ex by sticking around with his family rather than taking the pain and figuring it out herself and wants her ex to see her as a sister now. That\u2019s ridiculous and Maxs fianc\u00e9e sounds shockingly calm about this all things considered.

They just want to force Max and his romantic partners to accept how they view OP.\n\nI can absolutely see the parents and siblings kicking up a fuss if/when Max says he isn\u2019t comfortable with OP being invited to his eventual wedding. \n\nMax really should make it plain while he is friendly with OP he cannot consider her sibling since they used to date and had sex. He doesn\u2019t do that with sisters and it\u2019s an inappropriate request that they expect him to ignore that history of intimacy.

OP's parents could have still had the hallowed moral high ground by taking in OP, providing for her, and then making a plan for her to be independent. They didn't need to provide a family. You treat it as a kindness, but it's only a kindness if no one is hurt.

You have to watch your ex date other people. You feel weird about it and have brought it up to your family According to OP, they told him he needs to get over it. Through these conversations about getting over it you realize that your parents would choose your ex over you if push came to shove. It's gone beyond saving a defenseless girl, now your ex is your sibling and a more beloved member of your family than you are. Every person you now date has to accept that they're marrying into a family where your partners ex GF is present as a beloved member of the family. Your only choices are to cut everyone off and have no family, or accept that your family loves you less than your ex and try to maintain this fractured relationship. Everyone talks about how Max's parents and sisters adopted her so she's family. She's THEIR family because they consented and made that choice to choose each other. Max was not a decision maker in this process. \n\n\n>If Max was as hurt as you seem to think he is, don't you think he would have gone NC? He hasn't done that.\n\n\"If it was that bad he would have just cut off his entire family already\" is a terrible defense, by the way.

If they've bulldozed over Max's feeling all this time, and if there's a history of doing that, their \"heart to heart\" before she moved in might have been influenced by the fact that Max might feel like his feelings will never be a priority so, might as well accept it even if he hates it.\n\nI lean towards the Fianc\u00e9 overreacting to say the least, but I can think of a scenario where she is pissed about how her future husband has been treated by his family and maybe even jealous about how easily and willingly they bonded with a high school GF of his, but not the person he's going to marry.

So, I don't know, I really feel for Max here. \n\nI can understand parents being very concerned about a minor child who came into their orbit through her dating relationship with their son, and I can understand their desire to fix things for her. But their primary obligation is to their own child, and to allow the other child's needs to take precedence over their own child's needs sounds pretty messed up, to me. That is, I think the first thing to do would be to notify Child Protective Services (and maybe they did that, I doubt they would have shared those steps with OP), so the child could be taken into safe foster care; not necessarily to take in the other child themselves, wholesale. I wonder if it's a bit of a savior-complex, actually, like it's ok if we ignore Max because we're saving this other child.

Her oldest brother and her oldest sister couldn't be in the same room for decades and still don't speak but the middle brother and my sister are on good terms with both. When the eldest sister got married, she didn't invite the eldest brother. When the eldest brother got married, he didn't invite the eldest sister. My sister and I were invited to both and attended both. At her wedding, my sister invited both and both came; I don't think they interacted much but they didn't fight either. For less once-in-a-lifetime occasions, either one of them is invited, so it does lead to less invites to gathering for them and definitively more distance and work for everyone involved. I'm not saying it's all hunky dory. But it has been workable without having to choose and go no contact. \n\nMax doesn't have to invite OP to his wedding, nor OP to hers, but their parents and sisters can still go to both.

And conversely, if OP gets married and has kids, they'll likely spend some Christmases with her in-laws, so Max can attend Christmas at their parents then.
