Long story short I see them as my parents and they see me as their kid.\n\nI am close to their daughters and have been going to family events for a few years now. Max is getting married to Cindy. I have met her a few times and before this I thought she was fine. Yesterday I was getting some Mac and cheese at the youngest birthday celebration when Cindy came over asking what I am doing. I told her getting Mac and cheese and she got angry. She went on a huge tangent about trying to win back Max  and how I\u2019m am not part of the family. That I should get my own family since I am not needed anymore.\n\nI told her I am not going anywhere and she needs to live with it. I have been part of this family for 10 years at this point. She ran off after that. I am getting texts from max that I I am a huge jerk and I need to apologize. The rest are staying neutral and the youngest is annoyed at Cindy.\n\n\nEdit to make it really clear, I am part of the family I call them mom and dad. They tell me I am their kids.

But really this is really unique so I dont think you're wrong. Most exes creep around the family when they are trying to get back with someone.  I think you are just going to have to live with being an outsider ex gf to max and Cindy. And I dont think you should call her your sil. That would mean you dated your brother.

I wouldn\u2019t love having the ex GF around all the time either.  And your \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ve been here 10 years\u201d sounds really shitty.  Like you\u2019re taunting her that you\u2019re more important (which may not be true). Also, she\u2019s not your future SIL.  She\u2019s your exes future wife. \n\nI would prepare yourself that things may change.  You say you\u2019re not going anywhere but that\u2019s not really your decision.  The fact that they\u2019re staying neutral isn't necessarily a good sign.  If Max and Cindy start to go LC, especially if they start a family, they may keep things separate to keep their son and grandkids in their lives.  Like maybe they\u2019ll still see you, but not at holidays or family gatherings.", "INFO\n\nYou said Mac, did she hear Max?", "INFO \n>After the breakup they didn\u2019t cut me off even though I know it caused some issues with Max. \n\nWhat kind of issues? Are those issues resolved? Do you spend a lot of time Max? It sounded more like you spend time with his siblings than him.", "Please don\u2019t breed", "Personally, I look at it as saving a life over their son. Because I sure wouldn\u2019t have made it homeless when I was kicked out and still in school.\n\nThey are the best people I have ever know. Hurting someone feelings to save a life is in my opinion very kind.", "They are not her parents.", "We didn\u2019t go through CPS, there was a huge chance I would go to a random home. My grandparents are dead. I got kicked out and I went to a trusted adult which was them. They took a risk and let me stay\n\nBy the time my parents wanted me back I was 18 and was already living there for four months", "Thank you for this! People here are insane, thinking it's perfectly fine and normal to go live with your exbf's parents instead of your own family, or even foster care. \n\nThere's also the \"my ex is my brother!\" weirdness going on. But OP would probably lean into that like \"haha yeah I'm just quirky and weird like that\" because she seems really needy for attention.", "Right?! This is a unique and difficult situation, but I feel badly for Cindy.", "Should say NTA !", "I sure would hope not, I have been dating other people since we first broke up. Maybe I should make it really clear I don\u2019t want to date him.", "I don\u2019t think so. I said I\u2019m getting Mac and cheese and pointed at my plate were it was. So I don\u2019t think so", "He was mad at the time that his parents stayed in touch with me. I though he has accepted it at this point. We had a heart to heart when I moved in. I thought we were fine\n\nI am closer to the oldest sister,", "I get you feel you owe them and that you are a huge part of the family\u2026but do you see how this could be\u2026a unique situation? I mean I don\u2019t even know how to phrase it correctly lol. Not creepy. But something. You\u2019re the ex girlfriend that won\u2019t go away.", "Yes they are. I call them mom or dad. They may not have given birth to me but they are my parents in ever way that matters", "I see. Well good luck. That is one mess that even bounty is gonna have a hard time with.  You are gonna need to cut max out and just have a talk with Cindy to explain things. He isn't going to be helpful in that conversation.", "Do Max's parents make comments about you and Max dating in the past? Or make comments suggesting you should get back together?\n\nYou are close with his family but don't spend a lot of time with him so it's odd that she would accuse you of trying to get back together with him if you aren't in contact outside of family get togethers. I could see her being a little insecure but if you don't spend any time with him or the family doesn't suggest that you and Max should be dating she's wrong to accuse of you something that doesn't make sense.", "I think it is extremely dumb to just boil it down to I am the ex, at this point I am a million other things. Especially I dated him at 15. We are 26 at this point.", "thought so. sperm and egg donor does not equal being a parent. i support your stance.", "Ahahah no. This is not a heartwarming chosen family story. You stole Max's parents. This was not a legitimate adoption because you dated one of their kids. \n\nYou've got a really bad case of main character syndrome. It really sickens me that you don't care that you stole Max's family instead of trying to fix things with your own, or even just finding a new chosen family. No, you had to stick around where you had no business, and you've ruined Max's family permanently.\n\nIf you really consider yourself their daughter, you should care more about Max, their son, and your brother now, if you are to have your way. You should take steps to not hurt him anymore. \n\nI can forgive your actions at 18. But you're 26 now, so as an adult sister, yeah you're being selfish.", "Yeah it seems weird to me that OP thinks talking to Max would help. As if the only reason for Max to not be ok with this is if he was still into OP. \n\nIf anything, Max has been holding back his resentment to keep his family. Now with this added stress of Cindy rightly calling out this weirdness, Max might get frustrated and really let OP have it after all these years.", "No. They actually told me I shouldn\u2019t date, since I was messed up until like junior year of college. They were really excited when I did start dating at college my senior year", "But you're causing conflict. There was no reason for you to be a \"million other things\" at any point. Max shouldn't have to share his parents with an ex gf. If his parents wanted to adopt a daughter, they shouldn't have picked Max's ex-gf. \n\nI'm not saying you're TA. But Max's parents are definitely TA for choosing you over their own son just because they felt sorry for you. To them, your life should not be more important than Max's.\n\nI feel sorry for Max. It doesn't seem like he did anything wrong, to deserve losing his parents this way.\n\nThe only reason I'm not calling you TA is because you are obviously damaged from your parents abandoning you, so perhaps some grace is in order. Any other circumstance would get a firm YTA from me.", "Yes let me go fix it with the people who would beat me black and blue, let me sing family songs to the people who didn\u2019t think food was needed. Let me fix it with people that would rather sell me off to get high.\n\nGreat idea let me go do that\n\nIf they didn\u2019t want me they wouldn\u2019t call me their kid, the sister wouldn\u2019t consider me their sister and if they didn\u2019t want me they wouldn\u2019t allow me to call them mom and dad", "Does his family support him dating his partner?", "They are the assholes for saving my life. Seriously\u2026\n\nI sure hope there is more kindness in the world that saving someone\u2019s life is above someone\u2019s hurt feelings.", "Yes. They welcomes her right into the family and I haven\u2019t heard a negative word towards her or his relationship", "NTA. I think you should try to clear the air with Max. Make sure he knows exactly what happened. You aren't trying to disrespect his relationship. \nMaybe he is upset that when you broke up he didn't feel like his family supported him if that's the case that's a conversation he needs to have with them. But if they have been supportive of his current relationship and no one is bringing up the past your presence alone is not you trying to get back together with him."]}
