We don't have kids at our place, we don't babysit, and we don't linger long at gatherings where there are kids (most of them). My brother and my SIL (both 25) have two children now (5m) (0f). A few months ago, they asked if we'd be willing to watch my nephew whenever the time came for her to have my neice. We said no, I work a lot and my husband goes out of town for his work, so odds are one of us would have to call out on short notice. Knowing this, they hired a sitter.\n\nWell my SIL went into labor 2 weeks early, and the sitter had covid and couldn't come. They begged me to watch my nephew, but I said no. Husband was out of town, and I had work that entire week, and didn't know how long this was going to take. They said it was an emergency, to which I reminded them \"A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine\". My brother ended up having to leave her at the hospital to watch my nephew.\n\nThis was 2 months ago, and he and my SIL have been blasting me to the family as some demon. It's good thing I didn't take him, she ended up having a C-section and spent 4 days total in the hospital, that much time off on no notice would've have pissed off my boss. They're now saying I'll never get to meet my niece, which IDK why they think that's a threat, I'm not exactly a fun aunt. Our mom, who lives in another state, has taken their side, and say's that I should've watched him, But I don't see why I should be a babysitter just because my brother has poor planning.", "created_utc": 1675904717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xgv9y/aita_for_refusing_to_watch_my_nephew_while_my_sil/", "score": 1134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't seem upset with torpedoing you family relationships though, so I don't know why you bothered asking here.", "Well, if OP needed a favor, it would just be \"bad planning.\" \n\nHappy Cake Day Flower!", "Exactly.  Take the child so Dad can be with Mom, then start calling around to find someone to help out.  Not like you'd have to keep the kid for the entire 4 days.  Heck, I'd do that for an acquaintance. Or just about anyone.", "Yeah.  It's not like she'd have to watch the child for the entire 4 days.  Does she think the father would be at the hospital 24/7 after the birth?  Even in normal circumstances, the father would likely leave after mother and baby were settled and needing rest.  Go home, eat and shower, sleep, with the older child with him.", "Seriously. I have friends, neighbors, and casual acquaintances that are more empathetic.", "OP has conflated not wanting to be a parent with what seems to be a genuine hate for children.\n\nLike... Leaving an event because kids happen to be there isn't being childfree. It's anti-child.", "Not to mention the kid being 5 likely has some sort  of schooling/daycare. It could have been an overnight and school drop off, maybe that means she comes into work a half hour late, and the dad could pick up from school that afternoon. What a selfish b.", "Crystal ball?", "But then her perfect record of child freedom would be RUINED! Just RUINED! What else could OP ever be smug about?\n\nImagine bring so uninformed about childbirth that you are relieved to have dodged a nonexistant 4 day commitment.\n\nYTA.", "And I feel like most work spaces will be understanding of a family emergency. Or at least they should be.", "Yes! \nAlso, I doubt OP would've been expected to watch the nephew for the entire 4 days while SIL was in the hospital... she's just being unnecessarily callous and downright mean imo.", "You're right, excellent point.", "I guess it just depends on whether or not someone's actually witnessed people being this level of shitty. I have, so I find it plausible. And yeah, OP totally gets a YTA rating.", "I hear you but most people make throwaways for posts like this and that's how the suggested account names come up. You can change it/make up your own, but most folks just take whatever comes up.", "Oh ok thanks! Fixing it now", "Oh yeah. Hard to plan out illness. \u201csorry Covid this week won\u2019t work can we reschedule?\u201d", "This was the big part for me! not only did OP cause her brother to miss the birth of his child, she could've died or had surgical complications and her husband wouldn't have been there to make medical decisions for her.", "How would she justlify it if SIL died?  Somethig like:  \"she knew the risk was there before she got knocked up, these things happen.\"", "she\u2019s fine cutting off her husbands family. wonder what he thinks of that", "The whole anti-child attitude, including refusing to hang around if there are (gasp) *children in their presence* - is so cringy and elitist. I for one wouldn\u2019t hang around if they were in my presence.", "I can\u2019t wait for the arm caught in a piece of machinery at work. I\u2019m sure that medical emergency is coming", "OP's brother and SIL are laying the groundwork to set that up, I wouldn't doubt. Who needs enemies when someone like OP is your 'family'? Jesus. I'd absolutely notify work that I had a family emergency to take care of my sibling's child(ren) as they prepared for the birth of another.", "I had an emergency c section and it\u2019s terrifying. I would\u2019ve had a full blown panic attack had my husband not been there. My ex husbands wife took time off to take care of our shared child so my husband could be with me rather than caring for my son. She also brought my son to the hospital and picked him back up. A woman that literally is not even related to me took time to help me. This dudes sister couldn\u2019t even be bothered. Sad.", "Absolutely, my daughter ended up having an emergency C-section and I barely got to the hospital in time and I had gotten there as quickly as I could from my work. It went from we are going to let it ride out to we\u2019re going to the ER in 10 minutes. It moved really fast.", "I just gave birth last week and can't even imagine not having my husband there even with no complications.", "I think so \ud83d\ude02", "yeah she sounds like an ah that would say it", "Right? I have a kid, so I can\u2019t say I see through a child free perspective, but when my niece was in an emergency, we drove nine hours to watch the other kids for my sister. It\u2019s just \u2026 what you do?", "Cherish that woman right there. That is a woman who wants the best for your child- so refreshing to see adults acting like adults and putting the needs of the kids first.", "Sounds like you guys have a pretty good co-parenting relationship. \ud83d\ude42", "I love that your ex\u2019s wife was willing and able to pitch in and help. There are so many posts here where people are so unnecessarily nasty to each other in situations like this. It\u2019s good to see that not everyone is like that.", "That's so lovely, that's the type of relationship I have with my husbands ex wife/mother of my stepson", "Nostradamus predicted it. \n\nBut seriously, OP, YTA.", "I don\u2019t have a kid and never intend to have one and I cannot imagine letting my sister twist in the wind like this!", "She is an absolute gem. I am so grateful that she is my sons step mom. If my ex ever loses her I will be devastated!", "That is such a sweet thing to say."]}
