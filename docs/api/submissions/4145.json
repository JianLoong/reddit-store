He worked night shifts at a job he hated so I was alone during the day. He would often come home late and night and drink and end up getting very angry and yelling at me, blaming me for the divorce and just many bad things. because of this I ended up becoming depressed and we got into a more huge arguments about me being \u201clazy\u201d and I moved back with my mom last year. It\u2019s been much better especially on my mental health.\nWe still talk regularly but we are not as close. \n\nMy father called us saying he had something serious to ask us. He explained that his mother was diagnosed with dementia 6 months ago and he had just found out now from her current husband (88). He couldn\u2019t take care of her so she went to go to a Senior Care Facility and that\u2019s where she\u2019s been the last 6 months. Her current husband said that the monthly payment is 3,500$ for her to live there and he\u2019s been selling things they own so he can afford it. My dad heard this and contacted his mother. She wasn\u2019t doing amazing and claimed to hate living there and described it as a prison. He also said she seemed like she was still about 70% cognitive though could tell the dementia was there. He then proposed the idea about having her just move in with him until she passes. ( We live on the west coast and they live in the midwest). \n\nIn order to do that though is where me and my brother come into play. My father is single, living by himself and works 10 Hour shifts and would need someone at home to watch her when he\u2019s away. He then asked if we would move in for this reason.  My brother immediately declined as he remembered what it was like living with him and then he turned to me and I also declined. \n\nObviously I felt horrible but we are about to go to college as we\u2019re seniors in high school right now plus I\u2019ve only met my grandmother 1 time and haven\u2019t spoke to her in over 7-8 years. My father then explodes with rage saying how selfish we\u2019re being letting our grandmother rot away in a \nfacility. I just don\u2019t want to experience what it was like to live with him again and I\u2019m gonna be busy with my own life.\n\nSo AITA for not moving in with my father for the sole purpose of helping take care of his mom with dementia?", "created_utc": 1670374776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zenrj0/aita_for_not_moving_back_in_with_my_father_to/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That alone should absolve you of any guilt.", "NTA.  Your father does not get to voluntell you to such a monumental task.  A task NO child should be asked to take.  My dad died in January, dementia, no.  Your dad can hire a caregiver.  He's just too cheap to do it.", "NTA, I couldn\u2019t think of anything worse then living with an abusive drunk father while having to care for a senior with dementia at any age let alone being 17yo, \nGo and live your life man , this isn\u2019t your fight right now .", "NTA!!!  OMG so very much you are not the AH here.  This type of caregiving is brutally hard and you absolutely do not have the skills for it, nor are you mature enough to deal with it.  And under NO circumstances whatsoever should you have been asked to do it.  Your grandmother is where she needs to be and if your dad wants to take her out of that environment, that's his problem to deal with.  You are just starting your life, not even a legal adult--you DO NOT owe anyone to put yourself into this situation.  If your dad keeps pushing this, I can only recommend that you block him and go no contact.  PLEASE!!", "NTA.  You guys have to live your own lives. It's hard, but I'm sure your grandmother wouldn't want you to spend the rest of your childhood and early adulthood taking care of her.  \n\nYour dad might be in over his head.  My grandfather and uncle tried to take care of my grandmother with dementia. It's was ugly.", "NTA. I\u2019m all for family helping family but this is above your pay grade. People with dementia are often better off & safer being cared for by professionals in an environment designed to be safe for them, not to mention that their bodies can outlive their minds by many years. If mom\u2019s husband found a decent facility for $3500/month, he should stick with that.", "NTA you are not equipped for this.

Not only would it be unhealthy for you to be in that situation, it would be unhealthy for your grandmother. She needs more care than an absent son with anger issues and untrained teens could provide. She needs professional care.", "NTA -- you have your own life to live.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let your father guilt your for a decision he made without consulting you. My own father forced my sister and I to live with my great grandma 2-3 weeks out of every month\u2026 she had the option to stay in an adult care facility, but he volunteered us instead. Watching her slowly deteriorate was so hard and having my dad treat me like property to put me wherever he saw fit messed with my head. I finally moved out and got away at the age of 23 and have been living with the trauma he caused for years. We are people who deserve to choose how we want to live our lives and we do not deserve the guilt that people try to push on us for those decisions. You are 17 and set up a boundary with your father, respect yourself and hold that boundary. Let your dad figure out this decision that he made on his own. You don\u2019t owe him a thing just because he and his ex chose to make you and bring you into this world. Your life is your own.", "NTA. Taking care of an elderly person with dementia is way above your pay grade.", "NTA - and I am so sorry your father thought it was even appropriate to ask you a 17 year old child this. Your father sounds selfish and I promise if you helped you'd probably do most of the work. It's heartbreaking to hear and I know you feel guilt but honey you have nothing to feel guilty about. You are so young you need to go live your life and become an adult instead of taking care of an adult. It's hard work and definitely not something a child could handle mentally. Take care of yourself", "NTA.  My grandma passed away from dementia several years ago.  The best place for your grandma to be is in a living facility. \n\nDementia is hard and sad to watch. Over time, she will lose the ability to think rationally. She will forget to dress herself, she will forget to clean herself, she will forget to use the restroom properly.  And one day, her body will forget how to work.  It's heartbreaking to watch.  It is not the job of a 17yo to take care of.  Someone with proper training and knowledge of the disease needs to take care of your grandma.   \n\nYour dad and his stepdad need to talk with an insurance agent about what her benefits allow her. They need to find a facility that is within their means.  You are not selfish for not wanting this.   Your dad is selfish for asking his 17yos to move back in with him to help with his sick mom.  If your dad wants his mom to live with him so much, he needs to get an in home aid.", "NTA You go live your best life and don't let your father hold you back.", "NTA. Care giving needs to be provided by people properly capable of it.", "NTA.  Your father and grandmother\u2019s husband need to look at alternative care homes or hire an aide to help out.  Don\u2019t move back and take this on.  It could last for many years.", "\nNTA and don\u2019t do it. \nYour father should not be caring for someone with dementia if he couldn\u2019t even handle kids. \n\nBut if he is he\u2019ll bent on it, the way to do it would be through some managed care. He would need workers to come into the home.  Especially at night. Because dementia persons can get so confused and into some unsafe situations. This is not something any reasonable adult would expect a teenager to do. So just that alone makes me question his logic, without having read his history. Most likely she would end up in a nursing home anyways. \n\nYou and your twin need to be working on being teenagers, living your life, learning to be adults, going to school, etc. \n\n\nYour grandma won\u2019t be homeless. If you\u2019re in America Medicaid will pick her up and cover her nursing home expenses.  \nUnfortunately that usually happens once a person is left with a certain amount of $$$. \nI have seen many cases where families have been hell bent on getting their parent out of the nursing home before they spent too much $$. Sometimes taking them home when they were not done with their rehab even. This may be just my opinion, but my heart feels it\u2019s because the families are more concerned about there being $$ left over for *themselves* inheritance wise when the parent passes. \nJust something to think about.", "This is tough but I would say that your not the asshole because I don\u2019t think he understands everything your giving up, caring for someone with dementia is a round the clock care kind of thing which means not going out with friends ever. I guess it depends on what you value more, your time or the remainder of your grandmas time.", "NTA. You are still a kid and taking care of a dementia patient is hard work and can be heartbreaking. It is not a job for kids. Dad needs to do the best he can in a facility that is set up to care for her. If she has dementia she may not be content anywhere.  It's part of the illness.", "NTA - this is a huge ask of any person, and is completely unfair to make of a young person about to start the next stage of their life. Also speaking from current experience caring for an in-law experiencing early stage dementia\u2014it sucks. Kids, even ones with special needs, get better at life as the years go on. Seniors with dementia get worse and worse. I have nothing but respect for those who care for them, but I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone.", "NTA.  By asking you this your father has made it very clear youre just a commodity to him.  Tell him what goes around comes around and dont think about it again.", "NTA. Your father offered to take in his mother, that is not your responsibility at all - especially not because both you and your sibling have a bad relationship with your father. He cannot ask you to sacrifice your time and energy so that he can save his. Plus: you hardly know the woman.", "NTA. He knows exactly how he treated you and exactly what he is asking. He expects you to change your entire life to take care of your grandma until she dies. He is the one who could hire someone to watch her or move there and help. Or even send money to keep her there.\n\nHe is trying to trap you with him. The fact he exploded shows he didn't change. Don't do it. It will change the course of your life forever.", "NTA. There is no way I the world untrained 17 year old boys should be essentially the soul caregivers for an ailing elderly woman with dementia. Not only is this a wildly inappropriate amount to ask of you two in general, it is incredibly shortsighted and dangerous to assume that two kids who have literally no idea how dementia works can cope with all of the medical challenges, not to mention the psychological challenges presented by dementia patients, not to mention the potential for verbal abuse from the dementia patient which would almost assuredly cause psychological trauma. \n\nI get that he wants to get his mother out of that place, I really do. My grandmother recently passed and in the last year of her life had to live in a facility. Some of those places, especially in the US, can be incredibly cruel. Where my grandmother originally was was awful. They would leave the residents to sit in their feces for hours. The entire place stank of human excrement, every surface was dirty, and we caught the staff physically and psychologically abusing the residents multiple times (as well as stealing from them). So we moved her to a place that was reputable.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that taking her home is the answer. The best he could do would be to move her out by you all to a facility, and to do his research and make sure she is going to a reputable place. I could see it being reasonable for him to ask you both to visit her in the facility sometimes, that I think would be a reasonable request. But asking you and your brother to become full time caregivers is a non-starter.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA and I\u2019m really sorry that your father is trying to dump all of this in your lap. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated this way. Just remember, you are absolutely not in the wrong to refuse this request, no matter how much your father tells you you are or how much it might feel like it. If you did do this, you would be trading one huge problem for another huge problem; she would be out of the facility but she would be in the care of those unequipped to deal with her condition, which can be dangerous for everyone involved. You are not in the wrong. You are doing the right thing.", "NTA.  Do NOT do this.  The emotional and mental toll it takes to care for a family member with dementia is extremely, extremely taxing.  You are wayyyy too young to even begin to think about doing something like this.  This is NOT a good idea.", "NTA, NTA, NTA. Your father has no right to inflict such a huge task on two teenagers. Keep on refusing, and create a fall back plan for yourselves in case he goes ahead anyway.", "Your father doesn\u2019t seem to understand that you and your sibling are CHILDREN. It is not your responsibility to care for his mom. Even if you wanted to- as a decent father he should say that your life is ahead of you and he\u2019d take care of his mom.", "NTA.  This is absolutely a bad, bad, BAD idea!  \n\n\"Rot away in a facility?\"  And does he know anything about that facility, or did he just decide that asking two untrained teenagers to somehow replace multiple shifts of trained adults was going to be better?  Because you and I both know who's going to end up providing round-the-clock care, and it won't be the person working 10-hour shifts.\n\nAbsolutely refuse, because it's as flat stupid as him yelling at you because you, the 17-year-olds, won't rewire your grandpa's house for him.  You. Are.  Not.  Qualified.  You cannot keep her safe, you do not know how to work with someone who will be living ever further away in Dementialand, you aren't old enough to be practical nurses.  Just.  No.\n\nI strongly suggest calling Adult Protective Services or the equivalent in your father's home state.", "NTA\n\nBecause it would be YOU caring for her and enduring the atrocious treatment from your dad.\n\nDO NOT sacrifice your life for them.", "Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep him warm. NTA ever. Buy your dad a cape so he can be super mad.", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t your responsibility, especially not at your age!  People with dementia require specialized care that you cannot provide.  Your father needs to figure this out on his own, not use his minor children as glorified babysitters.  Also - he screamed at you over the phone, OP.  It will only get worse if you move back in with him, and he won\u2019t let you go to college.  You\u2019re a kid.  You can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t do this.  Stay with your mother.", "NTA\n\nYou're 17 year old children. You're in mo way or form suitable carers for your ailing grandmother. Firstly, you have zero experience and education to do it. Secondly, you don't have the mental and physical capacity to do it. You'd have to quit school, because that would be a full time job. \n\nDon't feel bad turning this down. Your father is completely out of order even thinking this, and then guilt tripping and manipulating you to give in. Fill in your mother and have her put a full stop to this immediately.", "NTA. If your dad wants her to live with him he either needs to be there to care for her himself or he needs to hire someone with the proper credentials.\n\nYou are only 17. You do not need the responsibility of caring for someone with dementia.
