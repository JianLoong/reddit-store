You \u201cinsisted\u201d and then complained about the job. Why did you bother?\n\nEdited to add: the idea that you should wait until you\u2019re living together to discuss your differences Is ridiculous and a bad idea.

Oh, you're going to try to force her to do things your way after you've lulled her into living together? Well you just blew the surprise.\n\nAnd no, she's not going to call you.", "YTA\n\nYou are the AH here.  As a cat owner, I will explain something.  Cats **really hate dirty cat boxes.**  If they get too dirty, cats will go elsewhere.  And, she is right about scooping boxes multiple times a day.  \n\nThe longer you wait, not only do the boxes get dirtier, but the scoopable litter makes larger clumps which wastes it.   This also tends to toss more dust into the air which is bad for everyone's breathing.   Your response?  \"I should have waited until we lived together **then she could not dismiss my opinion**.\"   That's world class AH material, right there.\n\n**Her cats are basically her kids**.  To be fair, this was an excellent trial run.  She learned you really don't want to care for her cats.  Her kids.  So hopefully she dumped you.  And you learned a valuable lesson.  You don't want to be with a woman who has cats.", "YTA.\n\nFirst, your gf is right; with 2 cats, you need at least 2 litter boxes. 3 is recommended. Why? Because cats get fickle. If they don't like that litter box, they WILL shit and piss somewhere else. \n\nSecond, your gf is right; if the cat doesn't like that litter box, they WILL shit and piss elsewhere. So, keeping the litter boxes clean? That's a necessity. Unless you WANT the cats to shit and piss elsewhere.\n\nThird, the vacuuming? It IS her place. Right? So, how she wants things done in her house is the way it gets done? RIGHT? So, if she wants the fur vacuumed every day, it gets done daily. \n\n\"Thought it would be great trial run to potentially living together in the future\"\n\nAnd, you failed.

It\u2019s her home. She can keep it how she chooses. By arguing with her and trying to convince her you\u2019re wrong you made her recovery harder and were not helpful at all.", "YTA \n\nYou said you were gonna help her, that means doing it the way she wants it done.\n\nAlso leaving piss and shit in litter boxes is 1. really gross and 2. often cats don\u2019t like going again when there is already something inside.\n\nAlso please don\u2019t listen to your mates, discussions about cleanliness and tidiness should definitely be had BEFORE moving in together. That way you can both determine if you\u2019re actually compatible. So many couples fight because one person wants the home to be cleaner than the other, the one person feels like they always have to clean and remind the other person, the other person feels like always being nagged\u2026 I personally find compatibility in terms of cleanliness one of the most important factors when it comes to living together", "YTA.You agreed to help her, even went as far to insist, despite her warning you that her chores were a lot of work.\n\nNow you're looking like Shocked Pikachu when you decided that  the tasks that were asked of you were \" a lot of work\" and refused to do the things you agreed to do.\n\nI hope you never move in together.", "YTA Have you noticed that her house doesn\u2019t stink? At all? I bet you haven\u2019t even noticed that she keeps her place really clean. That requires effort. Effort you INSISTED you WANTED to expend.

They should be scooped daily.", "YTA, some cats will go outside the box if it's too dirty and it's just easier to do when the box isn't overly full. Also 3 boxes isn't too many as it's often suggested to have one box per cat plus one extra.", "YTA - any cat owner knows the formula for litter boxes is number of cats plus one additional box.  And no one wants litter crumbs stuck to their foot, or shit lingering in their house.\n\nDo I break these rules? Yeah, sometimes in my own house. But not after demanding someone let me stay with them and moving in to their space.", "3 litter boxes for 2 cats is completely reasonable, and they need to be cleaned daily, if the process is too involved or something thee are things you can think of to make it easier, you can buy a sealed trash bin to quickly place the waste in so it should only take a second, you cuuld also get a carpet protector for desk to you have to vacuum less often, but honestly your behaviour overall immature, and rude YTA", "YTA, and so are your friends. A litter box per cat plus one is a standard rule of thumb for owning more than one cat, a simple google search will tell you this. Why offer and insist and then make her feel like a burden when you basically made her agree? What is it with people and this \u2018when you move in you can force them!\u2019 stuff?

That\u2019s nasty and unhealthy, YTA regarding the litter", "YTA.. absolutely should clean the cats litter boxes everyday.. sometime even if there is one thing in it, cats get bothered and say oh let me go on carpet instead\u2026 \n\nOn the vacuuming I dont think it needs to be done everyday (i do have cats) but if your gf prefers everyday and you agreed to help her well YTA for not living up to your agreement.\n\nI", "INFO: How would you feel if the next time you had to take a crap your last turd in all it's glory was still there looking at you?

She can definitely still kick you out if you live there. YTA", "YTA\n\nAh can't handle doing three tasks, scooping poop, wiping and hoovering. Your gf seems to manage it just fine.\n\nWhat made you pissed off when she replaced you for her mother? Was it that she wouldn't accept your half asses excuse for not doing the tasks you insisted on?", "YTA. The general rule is one litter box per cat plus one extra.

If a cat doesn\u2019t have a clean cat box they will go wherever they can. Carpets, comforters, couches. You insisted on helping and then complained about helping. Of course you\u2019re the asshole. \n\nAnd as far as your friends telling you to lie to her about who you truly are until she moves in with you and you can implement the changes you really want, yeah. Sure. That\u2019s not deceptive and manipulative at all /s", "Yta.  It's recommended that if possible you have one box per cat and an extra.

Always have 1 box per cat plus 1, they need cleaned daily no matter what, and vacuuming daily when you have pets is the norm. \n\nYou insisted you help her, complained and slacked with helping, so she found a replacement and now you're mad at her? Grow up. \n\nOh, and your friends sound about as mature as you. They suck too.", "YTA  \n\n\n3 litter boxes is recommended for that amount of cats. \n\nCats are animals of routine and some are pickier than others. You might think removing one poop is unnecessary, but removing that one in the litter is much easier than having to remove poop from the floor if the cat decides to poop there instead due to finding the litter box too messy. Yes, cats can react to those minor changes with peeing and pooping all over the place.", "you agreed to something then went back on it, and she probably likes her home in a certain state especially when not well, plus leaving poop lying around is pretty gross it sounds like you didn't end up doing the two things she had asked, i don't see you being able to live well w anyone like that", "YTA.  Scooping litter boxes doesn't take much time and isn't an onerous task.  As others point out, cats are fickle and will often avoid litter boxes that haven't been scooped at least daily.  Do you want them peeing on your shoes?  No.  So scoop the box.", "YTA\n\nCats don't like using \"used\" boxes, and if they deem it too \"full\" they can use the bathroom outside of the box.\n\nShe said she didn't want your help and you insisted. The least you can do is either complete the tasks as specified or admit you are not up to the task. She is completely justified in getting other arrangements to make sure the task is completed.", "YTA. had a cat for years... they are clean animals. And finicky animals... if it is not clean to THEIR standards, not yours, they tend to find other places to pee and/or poop.. and that's playing hide and seek, they are very good about hiding it in odd places, and it smells besides.", "YTA. Your gf takes really good care of her pets and her carpets. You're supposed to have 1 litter box per cat and vacuuming every day is good for keeping up with cat hair and litter dragging everywhere. \n\nI wonder how her ceta reacted to you. Probably hissed", "YTA, and you failed the living-together test. The rule is one box per cat, plus an extra, so three is necessary. You also have to clean them every day, like she said. But the issue here is that you insisted on helping her, then decided you didn't want to help her like she needed. You are a selfish a-hole, and I suspect you'll soon be in the market for a new girlfriend. Well done.", "YTA but at least she found that out before she made the mistake of moving in with you. She sure dodged a bullet!", "YTA\n\nBTW, you should get some \u201cmates\u201d who\u2019s mommies don\u2019t still wash their undies.", "YTA I\u2019m afraid.\n\nI don\u2019t own cats, never have done, none of my family or friends own cats. I also detest the psychotic bastards.\n\nEven I am aware of why you need regularly cleaned multiple litter trays if you are a cat owner.\n\nThe action on your part that would have saved you from this entire situation was to do some research into the issue.\n\nAs a dry run for living together it\u2019s not gone well. You failed a test of integrity if nothing else.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t have to do any of it, in fact she asked for you not to but you insisted, then when she wanted things done a certain way because that\u2019s how she runs her household you ridiculed her for it.", "YTA- how would you like to have to step on and around your own piss and shit that\u2019s days old? It\u2019s not sanitary for the cats. And how hard is it to vacuum? It takes like 30 seconds. All of her requests are super responsible for just having a clean home and taking proper care of the cats", "YTA - You offered to help do her housework while she's incapacitated. That means doing what she does not making changes and trying to tell her she's wrong (which she isn't). Your friends are assholes too for suggesting you can move in later and make your changes. I hope this woman breaks up with you soon, if she hasn't already, because she definitely deserves better.", "YTA. 3 litter boxes is the recommended number for someone with two cats. It\u2019s recommended that you have 1 for each cat plus 1 extra. And cats like a clean litter box just like you like a clean toilet. Would you want to shit on top of your shit? I bet not. It takes two seconds to scoop the poop out. Would you rather scoop it out of the box or have to clean it from the bed or floor because the cat was grossed out by the box?", "YTA. You sound like you're 15, not 35.", "She's a good cat parent, YTA. I hope she soon realizes this relationship isn't sustainable because you and she don't have the same view of pets.", "Yta big time.", "YTA. Even a quick google search will tell you that it\u2019s recommended to scoop litter boxes daily. The vacuuming everyday is a personal choice for most but we have two cats as well and we vacuum everyday around the boxes since litter gets flung out.", "LOL, that\u2019s not your girlfriend. That\u2019s your ex-girlfriend, she just hasn\u2019t bothered to call and tell you yet. YTA. I have three cats and four litter boxes. Every morning it takes all of five minutes to scoop them all. A little quick vacuuming wouldn\u2019t take too much longer. Maybe 20 minutes of work, but that was too much for you and now you\u2019re single.", "YTA", "YTA and I suggest you only date women without cats from now on. I have one cat and two boxes which I scoop one or two times a day. I don\u2019t vacuum every day but more often than I do when I don\u2019t have a cat. What your soon to be ex-girlfriend does isn\u2019t unreasonable cat maintenance.", "I feel like you could do a bit more compromise if you are truly looking at this as a potential future. \n\nRobot vacuum could help with this, and probably be a huge help once you go back home. \n\nHonestly the recommendation IS double the litter boxes for the amount of cats. And again unless you are going to invest in a box that auto cleans not letting poop sit daily is exact for not spreading potential disease. \n\nI wonder if you would feel this way if it was a dog? I mean literally twice a day at least and having to pick up poop so I guess what\u2019s the difference for you? Mentally?", "YTA because why would you offer to do something only to complain about it?\n\nThis shouldn't be what breaks your relationship though, it's just a silly little argument. Just apologise and you should be fine", "YTA, she is following recommended practice for taking care of her pets. You offered to help her when she was injured and then turned around and argued and caused her even more stress. To top it all off you are considering that maybe you should have waited until she was trapped living with you to display this lazy and ridiculous behavior? Lol\n\nYou just showed your gf that your word means nothing and not only will you not be there for her if it requires even minimal effort but you will cause her more problems.", "So you offered to help her clean and then complained when you actually had to do it? YTA", "You and your mates are manipulative A Hs. \n\nOf course YTA.", "YTA", "YTA \nMy 3 cats are indoor cats and I scoop out my litter boxes twice a day. It only takes a few minutes to do all three.\n\nBy not doing it at least once a day, you risk them going on the floor. Cats can be very fussy about their toileting habits and some won\u2019t go if the litter box is too dirty.", "YTA for offering to help with the chores and then moaning about helping with the chores", "YTA, I hope she leaves.", "YTA my fiancee has a cat she can't do the clean up chores right now. I do it even though I hate it. Have had in/ out cats that I trained to go out like my dogs. Sometimes you have to suck it up and deal with what your chick wants/ needs done. It won't kill you doing it for a few weeks or months.", "YTA. She is a wonderful cat mom. Also ... Thinking she cant dismiss you if youre living together? You AND your friends are manipulative assholes. Living together or not youre still wrong. Imagine, veing ok with your house smelling like cat pee.....", "Yta.. also the comment about just some fur on the ground speaks volumes. If you can see it, trust me there\u2019s more than what you can see. I am not even gonna waste time commenting about the obvious need to have the litter boxes changed daily or promptly, because that is obvious and all of Reddit covered that aspect. Do better.", "YTA\n\nWhy do you waste time and resources by flushing the toilet after you use it? That\u2019s basically what you\u2019re doing by scooping the litter box every day. It\u2019s like flushing the toilet only once a day. Maybe you should go a week without flushing your toilet and see how pleasant that is \n\nAnd filthy litter boxes can lead to the cats getting UTIs which they can DIE from if not caught and treated in time", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You OFFERED to do her chores and she even tried to turn it down. Then when you kept complaining she gave you an out by having her mom come and you\u2019re still whining??\n\nI have one cat. I clean her litter box once a week but it really is supposed to be daily. You\u2019re gf is not being excessive by insisting it be done that often. Especially in a multicat household. And 3 is the correct number of boxes, ask any vet and they will tell you that you need one per cat plus an extra. If you somehow manage to salvage this relationship and move in together, either buy her a Litter Robot or let her do her chores to her satisfaction.", "YTA\nYour girlfriend has really good reasons for why she does things. First off, how would you like to use a toilet that's only flushed every couple of days? Cats don't like it either. They also want privacy and a choice where to go. It is recommended by vets that you have as many litter pans as cats plus one. This can prevent inappropriate urination. By cleaning daily, you keep track of certain health problems such as UTI's, diarrhea, blockages in the urethra, etc. Have you ever lived with cats in a carpeted area? The litter gets everywhere and it is really annoying when it sticks to your feet.", "YTA. And if you don't clean up after your cat every day, you're also disgusting.  Only one poop? Seriously? Are you that lazy? You want your house to smell? They also dont go outside of the box because the box is clean. If it isn't, then there is a higher risk they will go outside of the box.", "YTA. Cat poop stinks and should be removed asap.  Mansplaining to her how to keep her own house and pets?  Gross.  And claiming you were there to help her but also were not willing to help her in the way that would actually be helpful - super annoying and shows you have no respect for her.", "YTA. Scooping the litter everyday isn\u2019t hard. I do the same and it takes me 5 minutes. Do you want a smelly house? Don\u2019t say you are going to help if you don\u2019t want to.", "YTA and so are your \u2018\u2019mates\u201d who are dismissing her as well \nThis obviously isn\u2019t going to work and you shouldn\u2019t try to change it.\nAlso she is definitely not calling you back and if she does, it is to break up", "YTA and that's not your girlfriend anymore. To keep the smell of cats and reduce the amount of cat hair from accumulating it's necessary to do what your ex girlfriend asked you to do. To disregard her instructions and act like she was asking too much and then arguing about when she asked you to leave proves you're TA. Keep listening to your mates and you'll remain in short term relationships for the rest of your life.", "YTA\n\nFirst, litter boxes should be 1 per cat plus an extra.\n\n\nSecondly, you'd rather leave them messy just out of laziness - gross.\n\nIf you reduce the boxes to one, then you're likely to have cat poop on the carpet or in your shoe. They don't like a messy litter tray.\n\nAnd last of all, you and your friends are gross. You wanna move in and then act Lord of the Manor trying to change how she looks after her pets in her home already. Like it's not even a hard task. And doing it daily means it will be fast to clean. \n\nYou're just so lazy.\n\nAlso she can totally dismiss your view when it's absolutely stupid", "YTA \n\nYou offer to help your girlfriend out with her house chores and then complain about doing them, I have two cats with two litter trays, I change them twice daily, you literally don\u2019t live together so your only getting a taste of her daily life by offering help and you made it about yourself, and your friends sound like assholes too saying you have the power basically when yous live together?

What she\u2019s asking you to do, and what you volunteered (insisted she allow you) to do is the tried and true method for keeping your litter boxes clean, your cats healthy, and your house clean of fur, litter debris, and funky litter box smells. It can get rank really quickly with one cat let alone multiple cats if you\u2019re not fastidious about cleaning their litter, and as several people have pointed out cats will pick their own toilet spot if the litter box isn\u2019t clean enough for them.", "Just scoop the poop and vacuum.\nDon't you want a clean living space? One turd hanging out is 1 too many.", "YTA\n\nFirstly, 3 litter boxes for 2 cats is what's generally recommended. (1 cat = 2 litter trays, 2 cats = 3 litter trays, 4 cats = 5 litter trays and so on.) Personally I scoop the poop as and when they go and I scoop the urine clumps out every morning and disinfect the trays every 2 - 3 weeks.. depending on if they smell or are running low. \n\nI think you could meet her in the middle and do the daily scoop but leave the vacuuming to 2 or 3 times a week. \n\nCat's are very hygienic animals, you wouldn't want to use a dirty poop filled toilet, so why would they? Plus, the less often you scoop.. the sooner they smell and need a complete change. For a task that takes what? 5-15 minutes.. it's hardly hard work. \n\nShow a little compassion while your partner is unable to do things.", "YTA cats like clean places to poop and pee. If you don't clean them at least every day you can get messes around the house. They also track litter all over the place so vacuuming often is necessary. Maybe instead of wasting time fighting you could have looked up some basic cat care videos and learned something that would have been important in your relationship. You insisted and then you moaned and complained about doing the chores, why would she want to consider living with you if that is what she gets?", "Um \u2026 in what world  do you think she \u201c can\u2019t dismiss your POV when am living together \u201c  ?? !!   \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f that\u2019s absurd and arrogant, you and mates might have trouble living with anyone \u2026.", "YTA  \nCats are very strict about their litter boxes.  \nA good rule of thumb is one litter box per cat +1 extra.  \nCleaning the boxes daily *is* absolutely necessary, if the boxes aren't clean enough, the cats will go somewhere else and that's a lot more cleaning up to do.  \nAlso, your friends are very much assholes for saying that once you live together she can't oppose changes.", "YTA.  I have one cat, and one litter box, and I scoop multiple times a day. Would you like to have to go in the bathroom where there's a s*** in the toilet you can't get rid of stinking up the joint?\n\nMost vets agree, the ideal number of litter boxes is number of cats plus one, so having three for the two cats is spot on.", "YTA. She knows her cats best, and specifically, she knows whether or not they'll start pissing on the floor if the litter boxes aren't clean enough.

Cat boxes should ideally be done every time you notice your cat making business, if cats think their box is dirty you'll start finding piss in all sorts of places, but even if you were right (which you aren't,  you absolute hairbag), you'd still be the asshole to your lady for not helping how she wants to be helped. It's not up to you to decide what she wants from you. Also, waiting until you live together to be an abusive dick is a terrible plan. Get better friends.\nI bet that if you ever get that phone call from her it'll be the last one.", "YTA not too mention just wrong.  Look it up on any pet care cat ownership website. The basic rule is 1 litter box +1 per cat. 2 cats 3 litter boxes. 6 cats ? 7 litter boxes. \n\nSecond, sure while it might have only been one then, if you leave by the time you come back it might be extremely full.  Not to mention, cats use litter so they can bury, which mean when the pee it gets buried all the way down at the bottom and sticks to the bottom of the box. There is probably a lot more in there than you think. \n\nHow would you like to have to use a toilet for number 2 with a floater already in there? Sure, in an emergency why not but I know I'd be skeeved out and I don't step in my toilet like a cat does. \n\nAs for the liter on the floor, let me tell you when it comes to carpets, if that's not swept up regularly it works its way down into the fibers to the mat of the carpet and becomes nearly impossible to clean. Plus, vacuuming more than a very small amount of liter at a time really clogs up a vacuumed and breaks them easily. \n\nFinally, it's her house! Don't offer to help someone if you're not willing to do it. Maybe she's super sensitive to the odor, has a need for her living space to be very clean, or just wants it done everyday. Regardless, it's her house and you offered so don't try to tell her how it.should be done. Either do it, or just tell her that you're too lazy to actually help and were just trying to get free points for offering and she should get someone else to do it if you won't. I mean, she refused and you insisted and now you're going back on your word. I'm guessing she's more upset that you tried to earn points with her and didn't actually keep your word. \n\nDo you have cats? Do you know the consequences of not doing those things? Maybe one or both of the cats are finicky and won't use it if it's not cleaned daily and will go outside the box. I don't know! And neither do you. You know who does? Your girlfriend", "These are boxes of poop. POOP!!! Clean them every day if not every time you see something in them. Otherwise the house smells like cat poop.

I have hardwood floors, so I had a little mat in front of the box, which I\u2019d shake into the box when needed.  I\u2019d scoop into a bin with a scented bag which I changed once a day.  I also had a little brush sweeper, so all very convenient and easy.  \nI\u2019ve cat sit.  Typically I go twice a day and that box is pristine each time I leave.

There were many times that he would pee on my bed because he didn't feel the litter box was clean enough. I finally got him to stop by cleaning it twice a day instead of just once.
