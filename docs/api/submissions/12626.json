You \u201cinsisted\u201d and then complained about the job. Why did you bother?\n\nEdited to add: the idea that you should wait until you\u2019re living together to discuss your differences Is ridiculous and a bad idea.

Oh, you're going to try to force her to do things your way after you've lulled her into living together? Well you just blew the surprise.\n\nAnd no, she's not going to call you.", "YTA\n\nYou are the AH here.  As a cat owner, I will explain something.  Cats **really hate dirty cat boxes.**  If they get too dirty, cats will go elsewhere.  And, she is right about scooping boxes multiple times a day.  \n\nThe longer you wait, not only do the boxes get dirtier, but the scoopable litter makes larger clumps which wastes it.   This also tends to toss more dust into the air which is bad for everyone's breathing.   Your response?  \"I should have waited until we lived together **then she could not dismiss my opinion**.\"   That's world class AH material, right there.\n\n**Her cats are basically her kids**.  To be fair, this was an excellent trial run.  She learned you really don't want to care for her cats.  Her kids.  So hopefully she dumped you.  And you learned a valuable lesson.  You don't want to be with a woman who has cats.", "YTA.\n\nFirst, your gf is right; with 2 cats, you need at least 2 litter boxes. 3 is recommended. Why? Because cats get fickle. If they don't like that litter box, they WILL shit and piss somewhere else. \n\nSecond, your gf is right; if the cat doesn't like that litter box, they WILL shit and piss elsewhere. So, keeping the litter boxes clean? That's a necessity. Unless you WANT the cats to shit and piss elsewhere.\n\nThird, the vacuuming? It IS her place. Right? So, how she wants things done in her house is the way it gets done? RIGHT? So, if she wants the fur vacuumed every day, it gets done daily. \n\n\"Thought it would be great trial run to potentially living together in the future\"\n\nAnd, you failed.

It\u2019s her home. She can keep it how she chooses. By arguing with her and trying to convince her you\u2019re wrong you made her recovery harder and were not helpful at all.", "YTA \n\nYou said you were gonna help her, that means doing it the way she wants it done.\n\nAlso leaving piss and shit in litter boxes is 1. really gross and 2. often cats don\u2019t like going again when there is already something inside.\n\nAlso please don\u2019t listen to your mates, discussions about cleanliness and tidiness should definitely be had BEFORE moving in together. That way you can both determine if you\u2019re actually compatible. So many couples fight because one person wants the home to be cleaner than the other, the one person feels like they always have to clean and remind the other person, the other person feels like always being nagged\u2026 I personally find compatibility in terms of cleanliness one of the most important factors when it comes to living together", "YTA.You agreed to help her, even went as far to insist, despite her warning you that her chores were a lot of work.\n\nNow you're looking like Shocked Pikachu when you decided that  the tasks that were asked of you were \" a lot of work\" and refused to do the things you agreed to do.\n\nI hope you never move in together.", "YTA Have you noticed that her house doesn\u2019t stink? At all? I bet you haven\u2019t even noticed that she keeps her place really clean. That requires effort. Effort you INSISTED you WANTED to expend.

They should be scooped daily.", "YTA, some cats will go outside the box if it's too dirty and it's just easier to do when the box isn't overly full. Also 3 boxes isn't too many as it's often suggested to have one box per cat plus one extra.", "YTA - any cat owner knows the formula for litter boxes is number of cats plus one additional box.  And no one wants litter crumbs stuck to their foot, or shit lingering in their house.\n\nDo I break these rules? Yeah, sometimes in my own house. But not after demanding someone let me stay with them and moving in to their space.", "3 litter boxes for 2 cats is completely reasonable, and they need to be cleaned daily, if the process is too involved or something thee are things you can think of to make it easier, you can buy a sealed trash bin to quickly place the waste in so it should only take a second, you cuuld also get a carpet protector for desk to you have to vacuum less often, but honestly your behaviour overall immature, and rude YTA", "YTA, and so are your friends. A litter box per cat plus one is a standard rule of thumb for owning more than one cat, a simple google search will tell you this. Why offer and insist and then make her feel like a burden when you basically made her agree? What is it with people and this \u2018when you move in you can force them!\u2019 stuff?

That\u2019s nasty and unhealthy, YTA regarding the litter", "YTA.. absolutely should clean the cats litter boxes everyday.. sometime even if there is one thing in it, cats get bothered and say oh let me go on carpet instead\u2026 \n\nOn the vacuuming I dont think it needs to be done everyday (i do have cats) but if your gf prefers everyday and you agreed to help her well YTA for not living up to your agreement.\n\nI", "INFO: How would you feel if the next time you had to take a crap your last turd in all it's glory was still there looking at you?

She can definitely still kick you out if you live there. YTA", "YTA\n\nAh can't handle doing three tasks, scooping poop, wiping and hoovering. Your gf seems to manage it just fine.\n\nWhat made you pissed off when she replaced you for her mother? Was it that she wouldn't accept your half asses excuse for not doing the tasks you insisted on?", "YTA. The general rule is one litter box per cat plus one extra.

If a cat doesn\u2019t have a clean cat box they will go wherever they can. Carpets, comforters, couches. You insisted on helping and then complained about helping. Of course you\u2019re the asshole. \n\nAnd as far as your friends telling you to lie to her about who you truly are until she moves in with you and you can implement the changes you really want, yeah. Sure. That\u2019s not deceptive and manipulative at all /s", "Yta.  It's recommended that if possible you have one box per cat and an extra.

Always have 1 box per cat plus 1, they need cleaned daily no matter what, and vacuuming daily when you have pets is the norm. \n\nYou insisted you help her, complained and slacked with helping, so she found a replacement and now you're mad at her? Grow up. \n\nOh, and your friends sound about as mature as you. They suck too.", "YTA  \n\n\n3 litter boxes is recommended for that amount of cats. \n\nCats are animals of routine and some are pickier than others. You might think removing one poop is unnecessary, but removing that one in the litter is much easier than having to remove poop from the floor if the cat decides to poop there instead due to finding the litter box too messy. Yes, cats can react to those minor changes with peeing and pooping all over the place.", "you agreed to something then went back on it, and she probably likes her home in a certain state especially when not well, plus leaving poop lying around is pretty gross it sounds like you didn't end up doing the two things she had asked, i don't see you being able to live well w anyone like that", "YTA.  Scooping litter boxes doesn't take much time and isn't an onerous task.  As others point out, cats are fickle and will often avoid litter boxes that haven't been scooped at least daily.  Do you want them peeing on your shoes?  No.  So scoop the box.", "YTA\n\nCats don't like using \"used\" boxes, and if they deem it too \"full\" they can use the bathroom outside of the box.\n\nShe said she didn't want your help and you insisted. The least you can do is either complete the tasks as specified or admit you are not up to the task. She is completely justified in getting other arrangements to make sure the task is completed.", "YTA. had a cat for years... they are clean animals. And finicky animals... if it is not clean to THEIR standards, not yours, they tend to find other places to pee and/or poop.. and that's playing hide and seek, they are very good about hiding it in odd places, and it smells besides.", "YTA. Your gf takes really good care of her pets and her carpets. You're supposed to have 1 litter box per cat and vacuuming every day is good for keeping up with cat hair and litter dragging everywhere. \n\nI wonder how her ceta reacted to you. Probably hissed", "YTA, and you failed the living-together test. The rule is one box per cat, plus an extra, so three is necessary. You also have to clean them every day, like she said. But the issue here is that you insisted on helping her, then decided you didn't want to help her like she needed. You are a selfish a-hole, and I suspect you'll soon be in the market for a new girlfriend. Well done.", "YTA but at least she found that out before she made the mistake of moving in with you. She sure dodged a bullet!", "YTA\n\nBTW, you should get some \u201cmates\u201d who\u2019s mommies don\u2019t still wash their undies.", "YTA I\u2019m afraid.\n\nI don\u2019t own cats, never have done, none of my family or friends own cats. I also detest the psychotic bastards.\n\nEven I am aware of why you need regularly cleaned multiple litter trays if you are a cat owner.\n\nThe action on your part that would have saved you from this entire situation was to do some research into the issue.\n\nAs a dry run for living together it\u2019s not gone well. You failed a test of integrity if nothing else.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t have to do any of it, in fact she asked for you not to but you insisted, then when she wanted things done a certain way because that\u2019s how she runs her household you ridiculed her for it.", "YTA- how would you like to have to step on and around your own piss and shit that\u2019s days old? It\u2019s not sanitary for the cats. And how hard is it to vacuum? It takes like 30 seconds. All of her requests are super responsible for just having a clean home and taking proper care of the cats", "YTA - You offered to help do her housework while she's incapacitated. That means doing what she does not making changes and trying to tell her she's wrong (which she isn't). Your friends are assholes too for suggesting you can move in later and make your changes. I hope this woman breaks up with you soon, if she hasn't already, because she definitely deserves better.", "YTA. 3 litter boxes is the recommended number for someone with two cats. It\u2019s recommended that you have 1 for each cat plus 1 extra. And cats like a clean litter box just like you like a clean toilet. Would you want to shit on top of your shit? I bet not. It takes two seconds to scoop the poop out. Would you rather scoop it out of the box or have to clean it from the bed or floor because the cat was grossed out by the box?", "YTA. You sound like you're 15, not 35.", "She's a good cat parent, YTA. I hope she soon realizes this relationship isn't sustainable because you and she don't have the same view of pets.", "Yta big time.", "YTA. Even a quick google search will tell you that it\u2019s recommended to scoop litter boxes daily. The vacuuming everyday is a personal choice for most but we have two cats as well and we vacuum everyday around the boxes since litter gets flung out.", "LOL, that\u2019s not your girlfriend. That\u2019s your ex-girlfriend, she just hasn\u2019t bothered to call and tell you yet. YTA. I have three cats and four litter boxes. Every morning it takes all of five minutes to scoop them all. A little quick vacuuming wouldn\u2019t take too much longer. Maybe 20 minutes of work, but that was too much for you and now you\u2019re single.", "YTA", "YTA and I suggest you only date women without cats from now on. I have one cat and two boxes which I scoop one or two times a day. I don\u2019t vacuum every day but more often than I do when I don\u2019t have a cat. What your soon to be ex-girlfriend does isn\u2019t unreasonable cat maintenance.", "I feel like you could do a bit more compromise if you are truly looking at this as a potential future. \n\nRobot vacuum could help with this, and probably be a huge help once you go back home. \n\nHonestly the recommendation IS double the litter boxes for the amount of cats. And again unless you are going to invest in a box that auto cleans not letting poop sit daily is exact for not spreading potential disease. \n\nI wonder if you would feel this way if it was a dog? I mean literally twice a day at least and having to pick up poop so I guess what\u2019s the difference for you? Mentally?", "YTA because why would you offer to do something only to complain about it?\n\nThis shouldn't be what breaks your relationship though, it's just a silly little argument. Just apologise and you should be fine", "YTA, she is following recommended practice for taking care of her pets. You offered to help her when she was injured and then turned around and argued and caused her even more stress. To top it all off you are considering that maybe you should have waited until she was trapped living with you to display this lazy and ridiculous behavior? Lol\n\nYou just showed your gf that your word means nothing and not only will you not be there for her if it requires even minimal effort but you will cause her more problems.", "So you offered to help her clean and then complained when you actually had to do it? YTA", "You and your mates are manipulative A Hs. \n\nOf course YTA.", "YTA", "YTA \nMy 3 cats are indoor cats and I scoop out my litter boxes twice a day. It only takes a few minutes to do all three.\n\nBy not doing it at least once a day, you risk them going on the floor. Cats can be very fussy about their toileting habits and some won\u2019t go if the litter box is too dirty.", "YTA for offering to help with the chores and then moaning about helping with the chores", "YTA, I hope she leaves.", "YTA my fiancee has a cat she can't do the clean up chores right now. I do it even though I hate it. Have had in/ out cats that I trained to go out like my dogs. Sometimes you have to suck it up and deal with what your chick wants/ needs done. It won't kill you doing it for a few weeks or months.", "YTA. She is a wonderful cat mom. Also ... Thinking she cant dismiss you if youre living together? You AND your friends are manipulative assholes. Living together or not youre still wrong. Imagine, veing ok with your house smelling like cat pee.....", "Yta.. also the comment about just some fur on the ground speaks volumes. If you can see it, trust me there\u2019s more than what you can see. I am not even gonna waste time commenting about the obvious need to have the litter boxes changed daily or promptly, because that is obvious and all of Reddit covered that aspect. Do better.", "YTA\n\nWhy do you waste time and resources by flushing the toilet after you use it? That\u2019s basically what you\u2019re doing by scooping the litter box every day. It\u2019s like flushing the toilet only once a day. Maybe you should go a week without flushing your toilet and see how pleasant that is \n\nAnd filthy litter boxes can lead to the cats getting UTIs which they can DIE from if not caught and treated in time", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

First off, how would you like to use a toilet that's only flushed every couple of days? Cats don't like it either. They also want privacy and a choice where to go. It is recommended by vets that you have as many litter pans as cats plus one. This can prevent inappropriate urination. By cleaning daily, you keep track of certain health problems such as UTI's, diarrhea, blockages in the urethra, etc. Have you ever lived with cats in a carpeted area? The litter gets everywhere and it is really annoying when it sticks to your feet.", "YTA. And if you don't clean up after your cat every day, you're also disgusting.  Only one poop? Seriously?

If you were unwilling to do that, don't offer. It is recommended that you have one more litter box than cats, so 3 boxes for 2 cats is correct, and you scoop twice a day. Vacuuming is super important so cat hair and litter don't have time to get ground into the carpet. When that happens you have to shampoo the carpet, which is way more work. And the comment about changing things after y'all move in? Yeesh. I hope she never calls you back. You're a walking red flag. I bet you'd take the cats to a shelter while she's out if y'all lived together. You're icky.\n\nAnd, for the record, I currently have 9 cats (way less than I used to have) and a German Shepard. I have 7 boxes I scoop twice a day and I vacuum one to two times a day. I shampoo the carpets once a month, change the cat litter twice a month, and with one of those I scrub the boxes out. Two times a month I scrub the floor of the cat room and sweep it multiple times a week. That's just a small part of my cleaning two homes. That's just what you do when you have pets. You're bush league for sure.", "YTA. You also sound manipulative,  as do your friends. FYI people can always choose to stop putting up with your shit. Leases get broken,  divorces happen. Trying to rope her into living with you and then forcing your \"changes\" on her is immature, controlling,  and frankly,  creepy af. \n\nA good rule of thumb for litter boxes is one pet cat +1 more,  so 3 is warranted in this situation. Having dirty litter boxes can be emotionally stressful for cats.  How would you like it if your bathroom had shit piles and pee puddles? You also offered to help her. No one forced you. When you offer someone help, it's by their definition and needs,  not yours.  It's 3 litter boxes - how much time are you really wasting? Why is it taking you so long? Were you hoping to have children with her one day? Do you also plan to leave them in their excrement to save time? \n\nYour gf sounds like a wonderful cat mom.

You should apologize and grow up... and maybe find a therapist to help you develop healthier beliefs about relationships.", "YTA \nI\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve never owned cats before. Their feces is very acidic smelling, and while litter can do an ok job of masking the smell, leaving it for days will lead to it leaking through the odorizer.

Two cats, 3 boxes, etc... your girlfriend is doing everything right, but you are being lazy. You don't have to help her if you don't want to, but you offered.

He got it when I explained that the litter box isn't the bathroom, it's the toilet. He finally got it.\n\nDo you understand? Do you only flush your toilet every three or four days?", "YTA. You offer to help, she says NO because she knows it's too much work for you and you insist. For a start 3 litter trays is absolutely necessary for 2 indoor cats, they need one each and a spare, otherwise they can get stressed and sick.

No. And that's not even the same, these cats have to climb into a tray and try to go toilet while a poo is already inside, i wouldn't, would you?! I love your girlfriend for being a responsible cat owner and keeping her cats inside too. Again, YTA.", "Everyone's already told you why YTA, but I wanted to add that a litterbox +1 for every cat is the standard. So three litter boxes for two cats is right within that standard.

It takes me about 15 minutes to scoop the boxes and vacuum.  Which, apparently, is more time than you intend to invest in housework.  Good thing she found out now.", "YTA. Litter boxes should be changed daily. Cats often will start refusing to use the litterbox and go outside if it is too dirty.

Yeah, great idea to deceive your partners until they are trapped with you. \n\nOh and by the way, I have 3 jobs. My 9-5 and I'm an actress and screenwriter. I have 3 guinea pigs. In the morning, I scoop their poop, restock their food, and sometimes fill up their bottles (30 minutes). In the evening, I scoop their poop, empty, wipe down, and re-fill their 2 hay boxes, empty, clean, and re-fill their food bowl, and wash their bottles and re-fill them (45 minutes).

Also 3 litter boxes is actually the recommended amount with 2 cats. And if you went to scoop the litter box and there was just one poop, why are you complaining? It's so easy to just scoop one poop and be done with it. There's a lot of reasons to scoop a litter box everyday, some cats will not use a dirty litter box and would use the carpet or something else instead, which is always worse to clean, and let's not forget cats stand in their litter boxes, their cute little paws literally stepping in their own shit and piss. So the cleaner the box, the cleaner the kitty and ultimately your home. I'd rather clean some litter boxes every day then get a potentially fatal e. Coli infection. It's not a waste of time, it's a matter of health and safety. Some people scoop the box every time their cat uses it, not just once a day. Also buildup in a litter box is absolutely disgusting and difficult to clean out because it clumps together and sticks to the box. \n\nBut most importantly, you offered to do HER chores.

He's actually obnoxiously conservative in all the worst ways, and he also has drinking and weed problems that he hid. She told me she basically had no idea who he really was until they got married, and he's *proud* of it, it's fucking sick.", "The switch flip is real, and why I stopped dating.", "Exactly\u2026if they get used to a certain cleanliness schedule and that changes, they\u2019ll give you grief in the form of pee or poop on the floor.", "Comment stolen from FlakyPineapple2843.", "I\u2019ve had cats who didn\u2019t care for wet food. Toby would eat it if there wasn\u2019t anything else but that was about it.", "My roommate\u2019s parents just bought her cats (she has two) that automatic litter box thing that rotates and it is a game changer.", "I had no idea that something like this exist! Thank you for the tip! I just searched it and i will definetly buy it because i was already thinking about a solution...", "We love our LR3, works great and the kitties love having always clean litter", "Ugh. Why is she still married to him? Sound like a nightmare!", "My ex was like this. Hidden misogynistic views and gender roles, even though we both worked and made the same amount. Also hid that he played games like warhammer 4-5 nights per week, and that he spent 10k per year on them.", "That\u2019s why I stopped getting married.", "Comment stolen from bmyst70.", "It stinks up the whole area. Seriously. Even if you can't smell it, I can and many others can too. Also if I take a shit and there's a little splashback that better be clean water not pee.", "Happy cake day!", "You have to test giving them several brands and types until they like one. Then feed them that until they decide they hate it now. Rinse and repeat, lol. My cats like the Friskies shreds... for now. \ud83e\udee0", "They cost a pretty penny but my babies are so much happier and healthier.", "They aren\u2019t cheap. But as we have no human children, just ones with 4 paws we were able to save up for 2 and later a 3rd. Our cats LOVE them. My Siamese would come and yell at me when the regular literboxes were the least bit dirty. But now he is the happiest of boys.", "I am a dog person and i ended up with a cat (package deal with so) and i also ended up taking care of him (lack of time from so) so i am somehow ashamed that this didn't even crossed my mind. I saw that this isn't cheap and only a few online stores have it (probably because of the price) but for me it will be perfect.\nI have been scooping and cleaning the litter for the last 8 years... I think so knew about it because of something he said once (\"there's something that i would buy but it's expensive\"). He never said, i never asked, i just told him he can buy whatever he wants \ud83d\ude2c. I think he was afraid i will be upset (we have kids but i would do anything for not scooping \ud83d\ude49).\nThe cat already eats the most expensive brand of dry and wet food (different brands for each) so there's nothing wrong to buy something that helps us both. My cat comes and asks for food - taps me with the paw to get my attention \ud83d\ude06 whenever he wants something.", "Yes, in my experience! You're supposed to have 1 more box than the number of cats you have, and at least 1 box on each floor of your house.\n\nI have 2 cats, 3 boxes. Mine will generally ignore the upstairs box, and then they will weirdly coordinate pee/poop behavior in the downstairs ones - it's like they'll mutually agree one day they pee in one/poop in the other and then they switch. But they almost always do pee in one and poop in the other.", "Yeah, I\u2019m not a cat owner but know some and they all seem to agree - one more litter box than you have cats is the best."]}
