You \u201cinsisted\u201d and then complained about the job. Why did you bother?\n\nEdited to add: the idea that you should wait until you\u2019re living together to discuss your differences Is ridiculous and a bad idea.

Oh, you're going to try to force her to do things your way after you've lulled her into living together? Well you just blew the surprise.\n\nAnd no, she's not going to call you.", "YTA\n\nYou are the AH here.  As a cat owner, I will explain something.  Cats **really hate dirty cat boxes.**  If they get too dirty, cats will go elsewhere.  And, she is right about scooping boxes multiple times a day.  \n\nThe longer you wait, not only do the boxes get dirtier, but the scoopable litter makes larger clumps which wastes it.   This also tends to toss more dust into the air which is bad for everyone's breathing.   Your response?  \"I should have waited until we lived together **then she could not dismiss my opinion**.\"   That's world class AH material, right there.\n\n**Her cats are basically her kids**.  To be fair, this was an excellent trial run.  She learned you really don't want to care for her cats.  Her kids.  So hopefully she dumped you.  And you learned a valuable lesson.  You don't want to be with a woman who has cats.", "YTA.\n\nFirst, your gf is right; with 2 cats, you need at least 2 litter boxes. 3 is recommended. Why? Because cats get fickle. If they don't like that litter box, they WILL shit and piss somewhere else. \n\nSecond, your gf is right; if the cat doesn't like that litter box, they WILL shit and piss elsewhere. So, keeping the litter boxes clean? That's a necessity. Unless you WANT the cats to shit and piss elsewhere.\n\nThird, the vacuuming? It IS her place. Right? So, how she wants things done in her house is the way it gets done? RIGHT? So, if she wants the fur vacuumed every day, it gets done daily. \n\n\"Thought it would be great trial run to potentially living together in the future\"\n\nAnd, you failed.

It\u2019s her home. She can keep it how she chooses. By arguing with her and trying to convince her you\u2019re wrong you made her recovery harder and were not helpful at all.", "YTA \n\nYou said you were gonna help her, that means doing it the way she wants it done.\n\nAlso leaving piss and shit in litter boxes is 1. really gross and 2. often cats don\u2019t like going again when there is already something inside.\n\nAlso please don\u2019t listen to your mates, discussions about cleanliness and tidiness should definitely be had BEFORE moving in together. That way you can both determine if you\u2019re actually compatible. So many couples fight because one person wants the home to be cleaner than the other, the one person feels like they always have to clean and remind the other person, the other person feels like always being nagged\u2026 I personally find compatibility in terms of cleanliness one of the most important factors when it comes to living together", "YTA.You agreed to help her, even went as far to insist, despite her warning you that her chores were a lot of work.\n\nNow you're looking like Shocked Pikachu when you decided that  the tasks that were asked of you were \" a lot of work\" and refused to do the things you agreed to do.\n\nI hope you never move in together.", "YTA Have you noticed that her house doesn\u2019t stink?

They should be scooped daily.", "YTA, some cats will go outside the box if it's too dirty and it's just easier to do when the box isn't overly full. Also 3 boxes isn't too many as it's often suggested to have one box per cat plus one extra.", "YTA - any cat owner knows the formula for litter boxes is number of cats plus one additional box.  And no one wants litter crumbs stuck to their foot, or shit lingering in their house.\n\nDo I break these rules? Yeah, sometimes in my own house. But not after demanding someone let me stay with them and moving in to their space.", "3 litter boxes for 2 cats is completely reasonable, and they need to be cleaned daily, if the process is too involved or something thee are things you can think of to make it easier, you can buy a sealed trash bin to quickly place the waste in so it should only take a second, you cuuld also get a carpet protector for desk to you have to vacuum less often, but honestly your behaviour overall immature, and rude YTA", "YTA, and so are your friends. A litter box per cat plus one is a standard rule of thumb for owning more than one cat, a simple google search will tell you this. Why offer and insist and then make her feel like a burden when you basically made her agree? What is it with people and this \u2018when you move in you can force them!\u2019 stuff?

That\u2019s nasty and unhealthy, YTA regarding the litter", "YTA.. absolutely should clean the cats litter boxes everyday.. sometime even if there is one thing in it, cats get bothered and say oh let me go on carpet instead\u2026 \n\nOn the vacuuming I dont think it needs to be done everyday (i do have cats) but if your gf prefers everyday and you agreed to help her well YTA for not living up to your agreement.\n\nI", "INFO: How would you feel if the next time you had to take a crap your last turd in all it's glory was still there looking at you?

She can definitely still kick you out if you live there. YTA", "YTA\n\nAh can't handle doing three tasks, scooping poop, wiping and hoovering. Your gf seems to manage it just fine.\n\nWhat made you pissed off when she replaced you for her mother? Was it that she wouldn't accept your half asses excuse for not doing the tasks you insisted on?", "YTA. The general rule is one litter box per cat plus one extra.

If a cat doesn\u2019t have a clean cat box they will go wherever they can. Carpets, comforters, couches. You insisted on helping and then complained about helping. Of course you\u2019re the asshole. \n\nAnd as far as your friends telling you to lie to her about who you truly are until she moves in with you and you can implement the changes you really want, yeah. Sure. That\u2019s not deceptive and manipulative at all /s", "Yta.  It's recommended that if possible you have one box per cat and an extra.

Always have 1 box per cat plus 1, they need cleaned daily no matter what, and vacuuming daily when you have pets is the norm. \n\nYou insisted you help her, complained and slacked with helping, so she found a replacement and now you're mad at her? Grow up. \n\nOh, and your friends sound about as mature as you. They suck too.", "YTA  \n\n\n3 litter boxes is recommended for that amount of cats. \n\nCats are animals of routine and some are pickier than others. You might think removing one poop is unnecessary, but removing that one in the litter is much easier than having to remove poop from the floor if the cat decides to poop there instead due to finding the litter box too messy. Yes, cats can react to those minor changes with peeing and pooping all over the place.", "you agreed to something then went back on it, and she probably likes her home in a certain state especially when not well, plus leaving poop lying around is pretty gross it sounds like you didn't end up doing the two things she had asked, i don't see you being able to live well w anyone like that", "YTA.  Scooping litter boxes doesn't take much time and isn't an onerous task.  As others point out, cats are fickle and will often avoid litter boxes that haven't been scooped at least daily.  Do you want them peeing on your shoes?  No.  So scoop the box.", "YTA\n\nCats don't like using \"used\" boxes, and if they deem it too \"full\" they can use the bathroom outside of the box.\n\nShe said she didn't want your help and you insisted. The least you can do is either complete the tasks as specified or admit you are not up to the task. She is completely justified in getting other arrangements to make sure the task is completed.", "YTA. had a cat for years... they are clean animals. And finicky animals... if it is not clean to THEIR standards, not yours, they tend to find other places to pee and/or poop.. and that's playing hide and seek, they are very good about hiding it in odd places, and it smells besides.", "YTA. Your gf takes really good care of her pets and her carpets. You're supposed to have 1 litter box per cat and vacuuming every day is good for keeping up with cat hair and litter dragging everywhere. \n\nI wonder how her ceta reacted to you. Probably hissed", "YTA, and you failed the living-together test. The rule is one box per cat, plus an extra, so three is necessary. You also have to clean them every day, like she said. But the issue here is that you insisted on helping her, then decided you didn't want to help her like she needed. You are a selfish a-hole, and I suspect you'll soon be in the market for a new girlfriend. Well done.", "YTA but at least she found that out before she made the mistake of moving in with you. She sure dodged a bullet!", "YTA\n\nBTW, you should get some \u201cmates\u201d who\u2019s mommies don\u2019t still wash their undies.", "YTA I\u2019m afraid.\n\nI don\u2019t own cats, never have done, none of my family or friends own cats. I also detest the psychotic bastards.\n\nEven I am aware of why you need regularly cleaned multiple litter trays if you are a cat owner.\n\nThe action on your part that would have saved you from this entire situation was to do some research into the issue.\n\nAs a dry run for living together it\u2019s not gone well. You failed a test of integrity if nothing else.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t have to do any of it, in fact she asked for you not to but you insisted, then when she wanted things done a certain way because that\u2019s how she runs her household you ridiculed her for it.", "YTA- how would you like to have to step on and around your own piss and shit that\u2019s days old? It\u2019s not sanitary for the cats. And how hard is it to vacuum? It takes like 30 seconds. All of her requests are super responsible for just having a clean home and taking proper care of the cats", "YTA - You offered to help do her housework while she's incapacitated. That means doing what she does not making changes and trying to tell her she's wrong (which she isn't). Your friends are assholes too for suggesting you can move in later and make your changes. I hope this woman breaks up with you soon, if she hasn't already, because she definitely deserves better.", "YTA. 3 litter boxes is the recommended number for someone with two cats. It\u2019s recommended that you have 1 for each cat plus 1 extra. And cats like a clean litter box just like you like a clean toilet. Would you want to shit on top of your shit? I bet not. It takes two seconds to scoop the poop out. Would you rather scoop it out of the box or have to clean it from the bed or floor because the cat was grossed out by the box?", "YTA. You sound like you're 15, not 35.", "She's a good cat parent, YTA. I hope she soon realizes this relationship isn't sustainable because you and she don't have the same view of pets.", "Yta big time.", "YTA. Even a quick google search will tell you that it\u2019s recommended to scoop litter boxes daily.

That\u2019s your ex-girlfriend, she just hasn\u2019t bothered to call and tell you yet. YTA. I have three cats and four litter boxes. Every morning it takes all of five minutes to scoop them all. A little quick vacuuming wouldn\u2019t take too much longer. Maybe 20 minutes of work, but that was too much for you and now you\u2019re single.", "YTA", "YTA and I suggest you only date women without cats from now on. I have one cat and two boxes which I scoop one or two times a day. I don\u2019t vacuum every day but more often than I do when I don\u2019t have a cat. What your soon to be ex-girlfriend does isn\u2019t unreasonable cat maintenance.", "I feel like you could do a bit more compromise if you are truly looking at this as a potential future. \n\nRobot vacuum could help with this, and probably be a huge help once you go back home. \n\nHonestly the recommendation IS double the litter boxes for the amount of cats. And again unless you are going to invest in a box that auto cleans not letting poop sit daily is exact for not spreading potential disease. \n\nI wonder if you would feel this way if it was a dog? I mean literally twice a day at least and having to pick up poop so I guess what\u2019s the difference for you? Mentally?", "YTA because why would you offer to do something only to complain about it?\n\nThis shouldn't be what breaks your relationship though, it's just a silly little argument. Just apologise and you should be fine", "YTA, she is following recommended practice for taking care of her pets. You offered to help her when she was injured and then turned around and argued and caused her even more stress. To top it all off you are considering that maybe you should have waited until she was trapped living with you to display this lazy and ridiculous behavior? Lol\n\nYou just showed your gf that your word means nothing and not only will you not be there for her if it requires even minimal effort but you will cause her more problems.", "So you offered to help her clean and then complained when you actually had to do it? YTA", "You and your mates are manipulative A Hs. \n\nOf course YTA.", "YTA", "YTA \nMy 3 cats are indoor cats and I scoop out my litter boxes twice a day. It only takes a few minutes to do all three.\n\nBy not doing it at least once a day, you risk them going on the floor. Cats can be very fussy about their toileting habits and some won\u2019t go if the litter box is too dirty.", "YTA for offering to help with the chores and then moaning about helping with the chores", "YTA, I hope she leaves.", "YTA my fiancee has a cat she can't do the clean up chores right now. I do it even though I hate it. Have had in/ out cats that I trained to go out like my dogs. Sometimes you have to suck it up and deal with what your chick wants/ needs done. It won't kill you doing it for a few weeks or months.", "YTA. She is a wonderful cat mom. Also ... Thinking she cant dismiss you if youre living together? You AND your friends are manipulative assholes. Living together or not youre still wrong. Imagine, veing ok with your house smelling like cat pee.....", "Yta.. also the comment about just some fur on the ground speaks volumes. If you can see it, trust me there\u2019s more than what you can see. I am not even gonna waste time commenting about the obvious need to have the litter boxes changed daily or promptly, because that is obvious and all of Reddit covered that aspect. Do better.", "YTA\n\nWhy do you waste time and resources by flushing the toilet after you use it? That\u2019s basically what you\u2019re doing by scooping the litter box every day. It\u2019s like flushing the toilet only once a day. Maybe you should go a week without flushing your toilet and see how pleasant that is \n\nAnd filthy litter boxes can lead to the cats getting UTIs which they can DIE from if not caught and treated in time", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You had to add to it?", "YTA\n\nthe recommendation is to have one more litter box than you do cats. so two cats equals three litter boxes.\n\nthey should be scooped regularly. and sometimes it seems pointless but other times you wonder how much shit one cat can make.\n\nand they do get the litter everywhere. it's in their paws and it's wild. vacuuming daily is more than some have time for but it does keep odors down and makes it less likely to get clumpy should the carpet get wet.\n\nyou likely have never owned cars. she sounds like a responsible pet owner. cats love a clean box. some cats will wait for their littler to be scooped/changed to shit. they may opt for outside the box if you go too long.", "YTA don't offer help if you don't actually want to help. Cats are clean animals and your GF treats them right", "How about you only flush the toilet once every other day? More than that is unnecessary. YTA", "So you \n\n1- insisted on helping despite her telling you it would be too much \n\n2- Proceeded to prove her right by arguing with her about what she asked you to help her with. \n\n3- are now mad at her because\u2026. She was right? \n\nFor the record, she\u2019s correct. You should have 1 litter box per cat + 1. And it would have taken you all of 5 minutes to scoop up the poop. \n\nShe *told you* not to come because it would be too much, yet you insisted and then agued that it was too much. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Apart from everything everyone else has already said, cat litter boxes STINK if you don\u2019t clean them out as soon as you can. Leaving it for even one day is not an option!", "YTA Do you like to shit in a toilet that already has shit in it? Yeah\u2026 didn\u2019t think so. She\u2019s actually a very hygienic cat mom. Her house, her rules. Sounds like your a manipulator and control freak. Hope she doesn\u2019t call you.", "The vacuuming everyday is a bit excessive if it\u2019s not actually needed. I can see if they kick litter out all the time and it makes the carpet gross, but I think every other day would be a good compromise. \n\nThe box situation seems normal though, the recommendation is to have one more litter box than cats. It\u2019s a heck of a lot easier to scoop boxes everyday than deal with cats that go to the bathroom elsewhere if their box isn\u2019t clean enough. \n\nIf you love her, suck it up. She won\u2019t have a broken leg forever.", "NAH. If she's that fastidious when she is able to, that's understandable. But when someone is taking over chores to help you out, you should give them a little grace and relax your standards a bit. Unless it's hot in the house, litter doesn't need to be cleaned every day if you have a sufficient amount of boxes, which she does. It was fine for her to prefer her mother come stay and keep up with the chores the way she wants them. She will probably break up you over this, but that doesn't make you TA. You aren't compatible because she's going to have very high standards for household cleanliness that will feel onerous to you.", "Lol dang, apparently I've learned something today. Have had 1-2 cats literally my entire life of 36 years and have not once cleaned the boxes daily. I will say NAH, as I'm even if it's jot necessary, it's her preference and you did say you'd help even after her warning that it may be a lot. 3 letterbox for 2 cats is what I've heard to do in the past though for sure", "ESH\n\n3 litter boxes is correct, you need one more than the number of cats.\n\nPoop scooping when poops appear is correct. The boxes need changing regularly. Wiping the sides daily isn\u2019t needed unless they pee/poop on the sides\n\nDaily vacuuming may not be needed, depends how much fur they shed.\n\nWhat litter are you using? How much are you using?", "NTA, her cats are not your responsibility. Considering circumstances - you should help but it should be reasonable request.", "NAH Different strokes for different folks.\nI wouldn't count on living together, and tbh I don't see the relationship lasting.\nThough you should probably still apologize.", "YTA\n\nThe rule of thumb for number of litter boxes in a house is one per cat plus one.  Your girlfriend wants you to take care of her cats the way she wants.  Consider this a trial run if you ask her to move in with you.  You don\u2019t really think she\u2019ll give up her cats if you two live together, do you?  Obviously, you are not accustomed to taking care of cats.  She will run you off quicker than she will her cats.", "YTA. She is practicing clean, normal daily cleaning routines. You are lazy. She\u2019s not the one who needs to change.", "YTA. Your gf ensures her home and litter boxes are cleaned daily. You may not think it's a big deal and doesn't need to be done, but there's an opposite end of this spectrum that is ugly. You insisted on helping with her chores while she's injured and then refused to do them. Yes, you are an asshole.", "I have a cat who lets us know when the litter boxes are too dirty by doing his business right by them. Op is going to find out the hard way what happens if you don\u2019t clean a litter box.", "Also the idea of \"it's only just one thing\" in the litterbox when that thing is a TURD \n\n\nI'm probably biased because my cat lives in my bedroom to not piss off the other cat but there is a limit to the amount of poop I am comfortable having in my proximity. And that limit is low.", "Had to go back and check his age; sounds more like a 15 year old.", "Im imagining the phone call with her mum\u2026 \n\u201cYeah, I know you offered to come and I said I didn\u2019t need you, and that the boyfriend was insisting he\u2019d do them all, but actually I do need you to come look after me after all\u2026 whY? He\u2019s decided that the cats are too hard work.. I did explain! I told him what needed to be done clearly and he still insisted, but he got bored and started telling me I had too high standards\u2026 yes yes I know, you were right, I dropped my standards for him and look where it got me\u2026 yes mum I know it\u2019s only two cats\u2026 I know and yes I\u2019m glad I discovered this before we moved in or worse, had kids\u2026 \n\nOP messed up so bad. His girlfriend might forgive him but her mother never will. \n\nEdit:typo", "Facts. I have three permanent cats at the moment and there are actually six litter boxes between them throughout the house. Not counting ones we use when we have fosters. I'd rather have more than not enough lol. Especially when one of them decides to be picky...", "Well, I guess I'm just more of a risk taker when it comes to playing Russian Roulette with my cat's bathroom habits.", "Yep, came here to see this. I'm not even a cat owner, but I know enough from friends and family to know the \"one per plus one\" thing. And scooping every day? That's just common sense unless you want to be disgusting. OP is LAZY.", "Best comment. I get everyone\u2019s arguments about wanting to compromise but the key detail is they DON\u2019T live together. He is seeing this as a \u201ctrial run\u201d is the same true for her or does she just need help right now and he offered?", "Agreed. I'm kind of interested in how passionately everyone is insisting on this regimen.  Cats like clean boxes, but honestly cleaning it out once a day is fine, the constant wiping can be done every few days, as can the hoovering.  And cats are less finicky than reported here, in my experience.  I've always had 2 litter boxes for 2 cats, and frankly they mostly both used one of them and never once have any of them peed/pooped outside the box.  Maybe I've just been lucky over the last 30 years to have non-finicky cats!", "She turned down his offer to help and he insisted. So no she shouldn't lower her standards. He's definitely TA."]}
