No, your trauma isn't an excuse to lash out at your sister or to be so rude. Most people have trauma in life. It's your responsibility to learn to manage it and not take it out on others.  \n\n\nShe's supposedly the idiot because she can't see into the future? Mistakes happen. She miscounted. There were others traveling with her that failed to count as well, so weird that you blamed her only. Placing all the blame onto her isn't fair. Or accurate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were other solutions. Could have taken turns, could have traveled to the store, or even could have gone up to the mountain and spent time without snowboarding since she really wanted to see the snow.

You went through trama but that is in no way to lash out apology is needed and you need to mind your words", "Yes. Not because you said no, but because of the way you said it.", "YTA which I think you know since you apologized. Can\u2019t you rent a helmet at the ski slope?", "YYA You should have looked for a place to buy another helmet. I have never heard of a ski or snowboarding resort that doesn\u2019t have a well-equipped store, although the merchandise is usually overpriced. And I fail to see his your sister is at fault when unless she was supposed to be bringing the gear. Even if she was, taking to your young niece that way was inexcusable.", "Um, yes YTA. You have obviously experienced a traumatic and tragic event surrounding head trauma, and clearly that triggered you. But you may want to consider some therapy or a support group, because it's not healthy to lash out in the way you did. You massively over-reacted.", "YTA. Not for requiring a helmet, but because of what you said to the niece.\n\nClearly you are also an idiot, since you and BF didn't check for helmets when you were checking the boards.", "Yta. You should never say that to someone\u2019s kid. Unless you simply no longer want your sister in your life. Pretty easy. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA.

Also, why couldn't one of you gone snowboarding with the kid? Why was this some weird all or nothing thing?", "YTA. Lend the kid your helmet and either hang out and watch or go without. An experienced boarder is not going to get a concussion on the bunny hill with a person who has never seen snow before.", "Yta \n\nWhy couldn't you go to another store?  Why couldn't you go to the mountain and buy a helmet there or rest a helmet for the one day?   \n\nI snowboard a lot.  I have never been to a mountain that didn't have a store or rentals.", "YTA. Why couldn't you take turns? At ski hills you can also rent equipment. I feel there were other options you could have explored.\n\nAlso speaking to a kid about their parent that way is NEVER ok. Shame on you. And you know it. Apologize already.", "YTA. \n\nThat comment was completely un-called for and not even close to the truth. There were alternatives and you guys decided not to pursue them. \n\nYou are the bad guy and should apologize for your behavior.", "YTA Your comment was entirely unnecessary", "YTA you or your bf take turns snowboarding with the niece. Instead you ruined her day, put her in what was probably a very tense situation because of your anger, and cursed/ insulted her mother. You hurt a child, way to go!", "YTA for all the states reasons in other comments. One I haven't seen...your mountain is so inaccessible that people have literally died on it before rescue people could get there and you thought it'd be a good idea to take a kid who's never even seen snow to snowboard on it for the first time?

It sounds like there is some back story here that you aren't writing about.  That response is way over the top for what actually happened.", "YTA\nI didn't see anywhere that your sister needed to bring her own gear plus spares. She probably mentioned going snow boarding anyway without the helmets because she likely didn't connect the dots.

YOU are the experienced snowboarder, and needed to go over safety and equipment first.\n\nThe fact your spares were cracked is on YOU, and the unfortunate closure of the shop was no one's fault there. You could have certainly made the trip to another store to buy replacements, OR CHECKED ALL OF THIS BEFORE MAKING THE TRIP.\n\nYou were right to say no. You were entirely a giant rude AH blaming her mom.", "Info: was your sister supposed to provide the gear?\n\nIf she was then I get why you\u2019re pissed but you\u2019re still the AH for saying what you said to a kid no less.\n\nIf you two were supposed to provide the gear then you\u2019re the AH for not checking prior to having company. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t rent a helmet on the mountain. \n\nYTa", "YTA.  It was poor planning, but I can't condone OP's behavior here.  They were over the top dramatic jerk.  Are rentals not a thing where you were going?  Usually if not at the facility itself the surrounding area has places looking to sell stuff.\n\nAlso, let's not blame the employee who called out.  No way of knowing what was going on with them or why management didn't properly staff the store.", "YTA. You had guests from out of state, you offered to take them snowboarding.

You find a nice, easier run lower on the slope that's gonna get new boarders experience with more realistic terrain and slowly get higher up the mountain.", "Which are her responsibility to keep in check. Her triggers are her own to manage. What she said was a massive overreaction and completely out of line.", "I don't know if it's mild idiocy if you have had someone die to non controlled snowboarding areas and lack of help. Yet then see it as fully acceptable to put a teenager in that spot as long as they have a helmet with no experience. \n\nI mean. Helmet has to be priority number one. But surely boarding somewhere safe is right there after it..maybe even less safe going somewhere not monitored even with a helmet compared to somewhere safe without one.", "That's just a bad excuse. It was in direct response to another question. Nobody was suggesting they go without helmets at that point. They could have gone two snowboarders at a time. There's a lot to do at lodges besides snowboarding\n\nYou're telling me a teenager can't help pack and double check? The fiance of OP's sister lost his ability to pack and count? No, three people packed for the trip. And the two experienced snowboarders they were with didn't think to check their own gear *before* leaving? Checking gear first is a basic must. Blaming one person when everyone involved planned badly is a shitty thing to do", "Because if you don\u2019t do backcountry and you don\u2019t regularly ski/snowboard then you\u2019re very unlikely to know what appropriate equipment is and why you need it. I can give the sister a pass for that. OP was the experienced one here and was the one who\u2019s judgement they were relying on. If OP was truly concerned with safety then they wouldn\u2019t have been taking two new/inexperienced snowboarders backcountry snowboarding. Their reaction was also very much out of line.", "If I am a guest at someone's house -- especially in climate I don't live in -- and they offer to take me to do some activity that requires equipment, I would not assume I have to go out and buy all the (expensive) gear required to do that activity.  I would assume, unless explicitly told \"you have to supply your own wetsuit/flippers/scuba tank/surfboard/climbing harness/boxing gloves/parachute\" that this was part of a planned excursion during which said equipment could be rented or borrowed.", "YTA. Exactly, no avalanche kit or anything (everyone needs their own)  just winging it with newbies on open unattended powder. OP has lost it and lashed out like a lunatic over their own crap. I\u2019ve lived in hi country with no stores and employees call out for powder days. That\u2019s the way it is, so being snarky about that is ridiculous. Nothing about your post tells people you were taking them *back country*, you\u2019re not only an AH, you\u2019re a moron too. Divine intervention kept you from having a usable helmet today and mostly likely saved you all from a greater tragedy.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be able to get help in a reasonable amount of time if you needed it and even worse, *which you should know better living in a mountain town*, if you **did** have to call someone for help, it would use an unbelievable amount of resources from your community. Wise up. You don\u2019t take inexperienced, first time riders into back country, and if back country is your only option, you do cross country skiing, not fking snowboarding. Are you new to mountain life??", "Not if OP isn't even bothering to check their spares before making the trip. Makes me wonder about water canteens, food, emergency blankets, etc\n\nThey don't sound prepared at all", "You'll more than likely survive just fine falling over on a bunny slope on a maintained mountain with avalanche control measures but no helmet. Might get a headache if you bonk your head on the snow, but you'll probably be ok. \n\nYou probably won't survive on a wilderness mountain with only powder, unknown hazards, and variable slope angles, even with a helmet, if thousands of tons of the snow fall off said mountain and on to you. You'll risk being buried, no way to get help, possibly nobody who knows you need help other than people stick with you, at risk for sending yourself yeeting off a cliff unexpectedly, but at least you won't have a headache.", "Yeah, I\u2019m also an instructor and my experience is that it\u2019s super rare for people to reach the parallel turn level from bc skiing alone. It just isn\u2019t possible to get in the necessary repetition without exhausting yourself from the uphill!", "Yeah, and there is no cell service either in Yellowstone. So she was gonna a go somewhere without ski patrols or an easy way to get help. Hopefully she at least had a beacon. \nGod I hate that show. But most Montanans do. It\u2019s ruined this state. But I can see how others would find it entertaining. I stopped after 5 episodes. Just couldn\u2019t anymore.", "Taking a bunch of noobs back country boarding is stupid dangerous. Your risk tolerance is all over the place. \n\nAnd trade helmets between runs ffs.", "So why couldn\u2019t you trade off? Sounds like you getting to bad mouth your sister was more important than the adults taking turns to give your niece an amazing experience. I\u2019d do way more than that for my nieces. Are you kidding? You just swap out over the day so she gets to go. She\u2019s a kid. You\u2019re the adults.", ">gonna get new boarders experience with more realistic terrain\n\nRealistic terrain is more dangerous for a newcomer, especially without emergency services there and ready, *especially* without any proper avalanche control. Which you should know for someone so *experienced*.", "Which is probably why she apologised afterwards.", "I think it's true idiocy. But people in here seem to want to excuse it, so I trod lightly.", "> It was in direct response to another question. \n\nYes. But I can see why she would want to leave after that series of errors, topped with a suggestion that triggers her. And why those things combined (and mostly that last thing) would be why she called her an idiot.\n\n>You're telling me a teenager can't help pack and double check? The fiance of OP's sister lost his ability to pack and count? No, three people packed for the trip.\n\nYes, that's basically what I'm saying. The person who wanted to snowboard was her child, it was her responsibility to equip her child safely. She was the one who was told that there was nowhere to buy/rent there. She had all the information and responsibility. \n\n>And the two experienced snowboarders they were with didn't think to check their own gear before leaving? Checking gear first is a basic must.\n\nThey had enough equipment for themselves, even though the spare they had was broken. They weren't supposed to equip anyone else.", "And on top of that, OP said they were heading out \"after lunch\" which I assume would've been after \\~12 or 1PM, meaning they were taking a beginner/novice into the backcountry when they only had a few hours of daylight left...", "It doesn\u2019t matter if you go into the backcountry regularly or not. If you snowboard or ski enough to have an actual snowboard/skis, you should damn well have a helmet. I literally don\u2019t even know how to ski OR snowboard, but I grew up in a tiny mountain town where winter sports are big. Every single one of us knew \u201cno helmet = no mountain\u201d by the time we were like, 6. And I grew up in the 90\u2019s. If they partake in the sport AT ALL, they would know this. **Especially having an immediate family member who lost their partner due to this exact issue.**\n\nI agree that OP\u2019s comment was rude, but I\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s literally no excuse for her sister not having helmets for them. ESH.", "The sister had to have known the circumstances around the ex\u2019s death. And the sister has a child so she should be aware of safety requirements for activity\u2019s like this if she\u2019s going to let the kid try them. That\u2019s part of being a parent and keeping your kid alive. \n\nBoth of those things = she should have known a helmet would be needed. \n\nI agree - sister sounds like an idiot, but I also know you can\u2019t say that to people without being an asshole. ESH.", "Indeed. Hard for me to be empathetic to OP\u2019s frustration when they themself clearly didn\u2019t check their own spares beforehand. Sounds like being ill prepared runs in the family.", "They did check, that\u2019s how they found the problem and why they didn\u2019t go.", "If you have friends with snowmobiles it helps. But yeah I also went to a nearby ski area once a week with school, my family was poor though, so I didn't get to go much beyond that. So hiking and/or getting my snowmobile buddies to cart my butt up the hill was one of my only options to progress faster.", "I hear you. I know it's not realistic, pure entertainment. But also OP didn't have a great plan for skiing. Someone could have gotten really hurt.", "Apologizing later doesn't make her less of TA for saying it. Can be one step towards her sister forgiving her if she decides to, but doesn't change that she's at fault.", "Wanting to leave isn't the problem. The problem is her disgusting words to her sister\n\nAnd that's a weak excuse. The planning isn't *all* on the mother. She's a human and made an error. Her fiance and daughter should have been helping keep track of things too. They're both capable\n\nDoesn't change that they were part of the poor planning. Not one of the 5 people thought to do a check before. That's on everyone, especially the \"pros\"", "Yeah all of this is just bad news bears", "... They obviously meant check before the day of the trip, when it could have actually made a difference.", " No, they were already THERE before they checked. The on-site store was closed, so they headed back home.\n\nAll of it could have been avoided if they checked properly when packing", "Exactly. I\u2019m so confused \ud83d\ude02, why\u2019s she getting so much flak???", "Yeah. Probably best the plan didn\u2019t come to fruition this time.", "I'm still firmly in the ESH camp.", "> The planning isn't all on the mother. She's a human and made an error.\n\nThe second sentence is true. But that doesn't absolve her of responsibility for packing for herself and her child. Making an error doesn't make you a bad person! But that doesn't mean we have to say \"it's everyone's fault\"... It isn't.", "There was no site, else they could have rented.  They checked gear before going to lunch, then checked at lunch.  Two checks.  The crux of this post is the fact they checked beforehand, if they hadn\u2019t they would have been headed up the mountain by the time they realized.  This is a really weird thing to get worked up over when they talk about checking gear in the first and second paragraphs.", "Well, by my count OP\u2019s getting \u201cflak\u201d for the following reasons:\n\n1) Crowing about \u201csafety\u201d yet taking a group of novices out on a backwoods trail in the middle of nowhere, far from help if anything goes wrong.\n\n2) Not bothering to check their own gear *before* heading out. If you reread the OP, you\u2019ll note the helmet shortage and issue with the spares wasn\u2019t discovered until they were already on their way. It\u2019s calling into question how prepared OP actually was for this trip.\n\n3) Ignoring the simple solution of just switching out helmets every few runs so everyone can get a turn and instead opting to cancel the whole thing.\n\n4) When asked (by a young teen) why they couldn\u2019t go, giving a shitty, rude answer instead of something like \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have enough safety equipment and I\u2019m not comfortable taking you all out there without it\u201d.\n\nAlso, OP makes another rude dig at the sports store being closed, like the employee couldn\u2019t possibly have a very good reason for not showing up to work.\n\nThat\u2019s why everyone\u2019s calling OP the AH. Because they\u2019re acting like one.\n\nEdit: spelling", "They did not check.  They were all the way to wherever they were eating lunch when they checked.  The boyfriend packed the car, the sister was inside with OP shooting the shit, so why the sister is the \"idiot\" here and not the dude who was responsible for packing for the trip is a mystery."]}
