The day comes, me and my bf ask if everybody's packed for snowboarding, we check the boards, strap everything to the car and go out to lunch. My niece (14F), who's never seen snow outside NYC, is talking excitedly about actually getting to snowboard the entire time.\n\nMy bf gets my niece to help check the gear so me and my sister can catch up a bit. Eventually he comes over to me and says that we're two helmets short. I ask if we have ours and if we still have spares (we always keep at least one spare usually, just in case ours takes a good hit), he says the spare's cracked. So I tell him we'll head to the Sports Center or something to pick something up.\n\nWell, guess what? The Sports Center was closed because it's employee decided to just call off. My sister is asking if we could go to the \"next closest store\" to which I inform her that the next closest store is more than an hour away in snow. So she says \"let's just go anyways.\"\n\nNow, my sister should not have been surprised when I said no.

No, your trauma isn't an excuse to lash out at your sister or to be so rude. Most people have trauma in life. It's your responsibility to learn to manage it and not take it out on others.  \n\n\nShe's supposedly the idiot because she can't see into the future? Mistakes happen. She miscounted. There were others traveling with her that failed to count as well, so weird that you blamed her only. Placing all the blame onto her isn't fair. Or accurate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were other solutions. Could have taken turns, could have traveled to the store, or even could have gone up to the mountain and spent time without snowboarding since she really wanted to see the snow. It's not her fault the store's employee randomly decided not to work.", "YTA. \n\nWho says that to someone\u2019s child? Even if she messed up, you don\u2019t need to be an asshole about it. You could have handled it much better or just used kinder words.", "YTA and that was extremely inappropriate of you to tell her that especially about her mom. You went through trama but that is in no way to lash out apology is needed and you need to mind your words", "Yes. Not because you said no, but because of the way you said it.", "YTA which I think you know since you apologized. Can\u2019t you rent a helmet at the ski slope?", "YYA You should have looked for a place to buy another helmet. I have never heard of a ski or snowboarding resort that doesn\u2019t have a well-equipped store, although the merchandise is usually overpriced. And I fail to see his your sister is at fault when unless she was supposed to be bringing the gear. Even if she was, taking to your young niece that way was inexcusable.", "Um, yes YTA. You have obviously experienced a traumatic and tragic event surrounding head trauma, and clearly that triggered you. But you may want to consider some therapy or a support group, because it's not healthy to lash out in the way you did. You massively over-reacted.", "YTA. Not for requiring a helmet, but because of what you said to the niece.\n\nClearly you are also an idiot, since you and BF didn't check for helmets when you were checking the boards.", "Yta. You should never say that to someone\u2019s kid. Unless you simply no longer want your sister in your life. Pretty easy. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA. You still had 2 or 3 helmets available, so why didn\u2019t you just go and take turns? \n\nYou experienced a horrible tragedy, but that doesn\u2019t mean you get a pass to lash out so rudely.", "YTA\n\nWhy on earth would you say that to a 14 year old? Also, why couldn't one of you gone snowboarding with the kid? Why was this some weird all or nothing thing?", "YTA. Lend the kid your helmet and either hang out and watch or go without. An experienced boarder is not going to get a concussion on the bunny hill with a person who has never seen snow before.", "Yta \n\nWhy couldn't you go to another store?  Why couldn't you go to the mountain and buy a helmet there or rest a helmet for the one day?   \n\nI snowboard a lot.  I have never been to a mountain that didn't have a store or rentals.", "YTA. Why couldn't you take turns? At ski hills you can also rent equipment. I feel there were other options you could have explored.\n\nAlso speaking to a kid about their parent that way is NEVER ok. Shame on you. And you know it. Apologize already.", "YTA. \n\nThat comment was completely un-called for and not even close to the truth. There were alternatives and you guys decided not to pursue them. \n\nYou are the bad guy and should apologize for your behavior.", "YTA Your comment was entirely unnecessary", "YTA you or your bf take turns snowboarding with the niece. Instead you ruined her day, put her in what was probably a very tense situation because of your anger, and cursed/ insulted her mother. You hurt a child, way to go!", "YTA for all the states reasons in other comments. One I haven't seen...your mountain is so inaccessible that people have literally died on it before rescue people could get there and you thought it'd be a good idea to take a kid who's never even seen snow to snowboard on it for the first time? There's nowhere nearby with a facility that has a bunny slope for beginners, rentals, medical people nearby?", "YTA. You lashed out at a kid and insulted her mother. Obviously YTA", "Yta. here\u2019s a crazy idea, share! first the kid wanted to see snow, she doesn\u2019t need a helmet to do that. second, i\u2019ve never known beginners that didn\u2019t need a break.\n\nyou could\u2019ve had you and your sister, then your bf and niece, then you and your bf. that way everyone would\u2019ve had a turn, no harm no foul. \n\nbut you had to be rude.", "YTA I don't understand how any of that was your sister's fault alone.  It sounds like there is some back story here that you aren't writing about.  That response is way over the top for what actually happened.", "YTA\nI didn't see anywhere that your sister needed to bring her own gear plus spares. She probably mentioned going snow boarding anyway without the helmets because she likely didn't connect the dots. Some people are just bad at emotional intelligence. \nShe also didn't go on about how you're paranoid or anything. \n\nMaybe check your safety equipment more regularly or before the trip stars", "Yes, absolutely YTA.\n\nYou went off and insulted her mom, while also refusing to compromise. YOU are the experienced snowboarder, and needed to go over safety and equipment first.\n\nThe fact your spares were cracked is on YOU, and the unfortunate closure of the shop was no one's fault there. You could have certainly made the trip to another store to buy replacements, OR CHECKED ALL OF THIS BEFORE MAKING THE TRIP.\n\nYou were right to say no. You were entirely a giant rude AH blaming her mom.", "Info: was your sister supposed to provide the gear?\n\nIf she was then I get why you\u2019re pissed but you\u2019re still the AH for saying what you said to a kid no less.\n\nIf you two were supposed to provide the gear then you\u2019re the AH for not checking prior to having company. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t rent a helmet on the mountain. \n\nYTa", "YTA.  It was poor planning, but I can't condone OP's behavior here.  They were over the top dramatic jerk.  Are rentals not a thing where you were going?  Usually if not at the facility itself the surrounding area has places looking to sell stuff.\n\nAlso, let's not blame the employee who called out.  No way of knowing what was going on with them or why management didn't properly staff the store.", "YTA. You had guests from out of state, you offered to take them snowboarding. It's pretty reasonable that someone who lives in NYC won't know what all gear they need. And is there really no Wal-Mart or Costco between you and the ski hill?", "ESH. \n\nYour sister should know to bring proper equipment for her child especially doing a sport her siblings S.O. Died from\n\nYou suck bc you cussed to a 14 year old and insulted their parent . Don\u2019t talk crap on kids parents to their face. That\u2019s not okay.", "ESH based on the extra explanation in the comments. Sister sucks at not listening to instructions. OP\u2019s response to her niece was absolutely unnecessary.", "Info: did you discuss with your sister that you and your bf were to be supplying the snowboarding equipment, like a helmet? Or was your sister suppose to bring their own?\n\nEditing to change fianc\u00e9 to bf", "NTA\n\nIt would be incredibly unsafe to go snowboarding without a helmet or prepped gear.\n\nNot your problem if they weren\u2019t ready.", "ESH\n\nYou were way more aggressive than you need to be, your sister was pretty insensitive. All in all, you're both wrong.", "NTA. Your sister must have known that helmets are necessary, especially because of the accident that resulted in your ex\u2019s death.
