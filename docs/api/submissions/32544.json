She says she held a grudge for all this time and it was a rebellious counter-fuck (x many).\n\nObviously I can't condone what either of them did - they're as bad as each other now. They're separated, he has the kids 75% of the time, he's lost major clients, they've both lost a huge house in one of the posher parts of Los Angeles, she has to pay him a huge chunk of her paycheck (because he does most of the childcare), she's put on a ton of weight... life is fucked up sometimes.

Did she pay additional money as a result of the car accident or not? I don\u2019t understand how \u201c$4k as a down payment\u201d has any bearing on this. A down payment is the money you pay initially when making a large purchase and then monthly payments for the rest of the purchase price come after. Presumably, the car is completely replaced by insurance and the monthly payments continue. There\u2019s no new down payment to be made, monthly payments continue and the only new charge from the car accident is the insurance deductible.

All cost were covered on the car by gap and full coverage.", "If you have the ability, check her phone for suspicious messages.  Look up how to recover deleted messages first.

It was a location that had a yield on green light. I did not see the other car approaching and they hit me as I was merging. I believe because I told my wife that I did not like the car, that is why she suspects I destroyed it.", "The argument was about helping her go over her work insurance. She wanted my undivided attention, and I was performing some of my work functions while I helped her. I was not responding fast enough and she got upset. I asked her if I could help her after my work duties and she said she needed my help right away because the dead line was approaching. We just argued about me not always helping her because I am busy. When she bought the car I told her I did not like it. This I believe is the main reason why she thinks I did it on purpose.", "Could you try to explain the logic of how the down payment is relevant to the car accident then? I don\u2019t get it. She seems to be focused on money that is completely irrelevant. Is she ignorant on how finances work and that\u2019s why she\u2019s focused on an irrelevant sum of money?

Is she often like this, wanting help RIGHT NOW despite you being literally busy with work?", "I wish I could explain it better. I am also baffled. She is from a very poor country and is not very knowledgeable about many things in my country. Her exact words were that she believes the car would have been paid off sooner if she would have gotten her down payment back or I wouldn't have wrecked it. Obviously I plan to sit down with her today and discuss more, but for now I am at a loss as well.", "[deleted]", "Yes she does often require my help with difficult tasks right away. I must confess, I am often busy or preoccupied with work. I am sure this does not help.

If your insurance fully replaced everything, then how is she out $4000?\n\nAlso, the fact that you pay all the bills in the household and she pays none other than her car... hate to say it man, but your relationship sounds really one sided. And now, all these years later, you find out she's been holding a grudge over this the entire time but never once communicated it to you(gee, that sure sounds healthy!), and also potentially doesn't even understand the financial implications. If she thought you stiffed her out of 4k 7 years ago, why the fuck has it taken this long to be brought up?  \nAnd in any case, if you cover ALL the household bills, do you wanna go add up the 7 years worth of mortgage, utilities, food, and every other household cost you've been covering? I bet you even in a cheaper area you hit that number in a couple months. You've almost certainly spend 1-2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more money that on household bills and expenses in the last 7 years. So is she going to pay her share of that now that we're playing the \"you owe me\" game?", "Nta, I wouldn\u2019t have wrote her a check. She\u2019s acting like a child.

The car/accident isn\u2019t the problem it\u2019s just a (possible) grievance she threw out at you in her list of things you\u2019ve done that have upset her.", "The down payment wasn't needed again as the gap insurance covered all additional car expenses and allowed her to get a new one. I was with her during the whole process and she never asked for more money .", "That\u2019s my thought too. Kinda makes me wanna rule ESH here. Wife should have brought this up *years* ago if the money is what she\u2019s actually mad about. \n\nBut, at the same time, it sounds like OP crashed the car, was ruled at fault, and then left his wife in the hook for $4k. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s ok, but a bad car crash that you walk away from doesn\u2019t absolve you from your obligation to make things right financially. Yeah, your wife hopefully is more concerned you\u2019re ok, but once you are, you need to then take care of the rest.", "Yes, sorry I'm very new to reddit, and I haven't quite figured out how to edit posts and I was afraid I'd hit word limit. My phone doesn't show the word limit when I posted.", "If she had to put $4000 of savings into a new car after OP wrecked it, she could easily see that OP owes her $4000. Getting the value for a car that's been totaled is usually not enough to buy a car of equal value. \n\nCan't explain the holding onto it for 7 years in silence part, though.", "You should be wondering why your wife needs 4K all of a sudden. The fight seems a little to convenient after all that you\u2019ve said.", "Please re-read my previous comment!", "Yeah... I don't really believe that marriages can survive past cheating, and trying to make it work only ruins both people's respect for themselves", "Kinda sounds like she's gotten used to it... and being bitter about $4k 7 years later when you make 60k and have effectively zero expenses is absurd.\n\nSounds like something else is going on, to be honest. Time for a serious and possibly unpleasant conversation.", "In my head signing the check over would show admission of guilt but yes when things happen it\u2019s not possible to think clearly.", "I have never destroyed any other cars or possessions she owns. Just this car, which I deeply regret.", "OP start your exit ... I'd be setting things up before she realises you've caught on - will make for a quicker easier exit and potentially less stressful", "Yes, this does happen alot. I have been trying to work on separating myself from my job. Now that you mention this, it does seem like our recent fights were all around her asking me to perform tasks for her that she was unfamiliar with (opening accounts online, using amazon etc)", "OP clarified in other comments that he was working on tasks for his work.", "Apologies, the first time I didn't explain what I was doing, but yes, it was work related.", "Someone's bringing their past trauma into here lol.", "I would have Said to her enjoy the money and that I hopes It was worth her marriage!", "\"and if I was a 'real man' I would repay her the 4000$ she used as a down payment on the vehicle\" \nWhy did you include this then? Makes it seem she had to pay that for the new vehicle.", "I'm glad I wasn't the only one, but OP clarified his wife didn't actually have to pay anything for the new car. It was all in her head.", "It is a possibility. I plan to discuss it more in depth when we talk.", "One thing I have learned is that women store every memory of their partner in their sub-conscious memory and use every bit of it in argument against their partner. These things can be from 20 years ago, but they don't forget.", "I understand that the 4000 was from the car op wrecked? Doesn't say anything about putting savings into the new car, says insurance covered it unless I understood wrong", "So in that case, if he would\u2019ve died in the car accident, would he still have owed her that 4k? Would she have stolen directly from his savings?because she\u2019s clearly more upset about the money than human life lmao", "Yeah, I have toadmit, i have been periodically checking my account just to see if she deposited the check. She hasn't deposited it, so I'm hoping that's a good sign?", "She did immediately stop the argument when I gave it to her. That might be what she's thinking.", "Yeah I was saying, you've done one thing \"wrong\" (which you really didn't, you didn't do it on purpose) so now she's holding on to an unreasonable grudge", "Thank you, it was difficult, I absolutely wanted to let my emotions out, but it was sadness and anger all rolled into one, and I knew it would just make a bad situation worse.", "This might be something worth considering couples counseling for. I know people automatically think couples therapy = relationship failed divorce imminent. But it\u2019s not that at all it could help you two on being able to work better together on effective communication which is the foundation to a successful relationship. I\u2019m gonna go NAH because really it just seems there\u2019s a breakdown happening in y\u2019all\u2019s process that could be resolved through therapy. Especially if your work is a big factor in causing issues where she\u2019s feeling you put more focus into it than her. Also if English isn\u2019t her first language or this is an intercultural relationship that plays apart into how she could be perceiving your actions hence the \u201creal man\u201d comment. If you haven\u2019t considered it yet I would start. Otherwise if it\u2019s not an option look up some self help books on effective communication in marriage or learning to manage quality work/life balance. \nWish y\u2019all the best!", "I might go one step further...if you multitask often she might feel the accident was caused by you not paying attention even if that wasn't the case.", "Because while you help her with something she has your attention for a second.", "Your comment is shortsighted. It's not about the money. That part of the argument is secondary. Couples counseling so they can learn to communicate with each other.", "He included it because that's what the WIFE said. He's literally giving us the reason he was told, why wouldn't he include it?", "I explained it because I thought it might be relevant and in the argument she seemed like she believed she genuinely lost the money.", "Ahh if she was just misunderstanding it, then yeah, NTA for him. I am curious as to why she thinks she had to pay $4k. That part I\u2019m still hung up on, but it ain\u2019t that big of a deal to me lol", "In another comment, he says she did pay a 4k down payment on the new car, which is what she wants repaid.", "I'll buy remembering; not all women hold these things against partners or pull them out in arguments. That's a general character flaw/ terrible communication.", "I know what insurance 'covering' it means, and it's not a replacement of equal value. Frequently you use the money as a down payment on another car, infrequently you can find a lesser-value replacement that the insurance money will cover. \n\nIf OP's wife is salty about a $4000 down payment she put on the car that was wrecked, then that's ridiculous. (Unless the car that was totaled hadn't been paid off maybe? Not all insurance will cover the rest of a car loan.) \nHowever, if she needed a car before insurance could settle it, or if the deductible was really high, she may have needed to pay out of pocket.", "I think in your wife's head you hated her car and resented your financial arrangement so you crashed her car on purpose and didn't pay her back for her losses. I'm not saying that's sane of her to think, but that's the impression I get. If your marriage is otherwise good a long conversation can solve this.", "Is this a green card marriage? This is all very strange.", "Don't go snooping on her unless you are done with the relationship. Talk to her. Ask her if there is something bothering her. She may be cheating or she may be struggling at her job. Or she may have had a terrible day and took it out on you. If you cannot look at your partner and have a vulnerable conversation, the relationship is in trouble.", "That's a bad sign... A lot of people gonna tell you that she is cheating on you, but I don't think it's that. But I think that she is experiencing some not too nice thoughts about you and your marriage. I've been through that when my partner was working late, always \"tired\", telling me nothing was happening and when I finally put him down to talk, he told me he wanted to end the relationship... I am a very calm and kind person generally and we didn't have any issues prior to this talk that he could use as an argument. But he confessed to me that it made him feel extremely bad because he didn't have a reason to finish a relationship or neither he had any episode in our lives that he could use as an excuse. He was hoping that at least I will start to shout when he told me about the break up thing, to make it easier to finish things, but instead I started to offer solutions how to save it. It didn't work out, but I was trying. So for me it looks like your wife is just looking for any excuse to start a fight so she can have a reason to break up with you. That's a pretty AH approach, but some people are too afraid to take the responsibility. I hope I am mistaken though.", "Ah,I  understand now, thank you.", "Great advice here. And yes, depending on our talk, there would absolutely have to be therapy at this point.", "This really doesn't account for his wife bringing up a bizarre allegation about him crashing her car on purpose from 7 years earlier.,", "Dang, She does yell at me for attempting to answer calls or emails while driving...", "Yes,the more I read what I write, the more I think I have not been giving her the attention she needs.", "It doesn't make sense to bring it up in this context. Makes it seem like he was the AH for not paying it.", "Did she though? I\u2019m still confused if she\u2019s out $4k or if insurance covered the $4k? Did she want you to lend her $4k while waiting for reimbursement? What\u2019s her motivation for that statement.", "Okay, thanks for the clarification and for downvoting my comments.", "OP never said that. He has repeatedly said insurance covered all the costs and the 4k was for the old car.", "I have seen my mom, my aunt, my ex bring things into argument from long time ago. Most women in my life. \n\nI am not implying that remembering these things is a bad thing / flaw. It's just that they store it in their sub-conscious mind and won't hesitate to point it out when they reach a certain threshold of heat in an argument.\n\nWhere as most guys tend to forget these things unless reminded.", "Think I saw a comment where op said they had insurance that covered the rest of the payments. But no matter what it's ridiculous to wait 7 years to ask for the 4k back of she thinks he owes her it?", "I'd like to think it's not a green card marriage. My wife was not a citizen of my country but she was here on a visa and working on her citizenship when we met. Idk , maybe it's something else I should be thinking about.", "Snooping and spying is the worst idea yet! That\u2019s unacceptable behavior and the OP doesn\u2019t seem like he is the kind of guy. OP don\u2019t do that!", "Yes it does. Their communication isn\u2019t optimal right now. She brought up something he did years ago because she\u2019s frustrated. What exactly is she frustrated about? Well we don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what MFT can assist with. To bring awareness to why a person is reacting to something that seems completely unrelated but actually is related to the overarching issue. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot that OP put in their post and subsequent comments that could be easy to over look but are actually clues on aspects into the functioning of their relationship that could be worth exploring with a therapist. As I said to OP it\u2019s not about the car. He said the argument spiraled off on to the topic of the car meaning by that point she was pretty upset and just starting thinking of other times he\u2019s upset her/let her down/failed to meet some unspoken expectations she has w/e you want to call it.", "\u2026somehow I have to imagine she has said this to you before. You\u2019re NTA in your posted situation. She\u2019s clearly not completely innocent in all this either if she\u2019s been harboring a secret grudge you didn\u2019t even know about for *seven years*. This is communication issues on both sides.", "Of course it makes sense, it's part of the story and her reasoning for her response. If he didn't mention it then a hundred people would comment \"Did she give a reason?\",  \"We need more info\", \"something's missing here\", etc.\n\nJust because there's no logic to the content of her sentence doesn't mean there's no logic to OP including the sentence...\n\nIf this sub were up to you, all the posts would be five sentences long and have absolutely no context lol.", "This is such a regrettable comment", "She did not lose the money. My current guess is that because she is not really fluent in my countries finances and how everything played out that she just doesn't understand.", "I dont believe I have down voted anyone. Apologies if someone else downvoted you.", "You're an idiot, that's why you've been downvoted.", "Yes, you are correct. I need to edit my post so all answers can be found there.", "This is obviously not a comprehensive statement or true in any general sense, and you definitely can\u2019t speak for \u201cmost\u201d men. What I think is happening is that people prioritize different things in their life, and you perhaps don\u2019t prioritize your relationships with the women in your life so these details aren\u2019t that important to you.", "I don\u2019t think you need to worry about her using you for a green card if she was already working on her citizenship. She could\u2019ve left after two years of being in the marriage and kept her green card so it\u2019s highly unlikely she would stay for 7 years if that\u2019s what she wanted. There are definitely some underlying problems but I can\u2019t say what. Only a conversation with her can solve this", "Yeah... No offense, but after this last comment, I would try to make sure she's not just in this for the green card.", "I am not going to spy on her, I am not even really great on figuring out alot of these tricks other people were mentioning.", "He said he didn't even know what he would be looking for... That's what he would be looking for.  As for unacceptable behavior, on the scale of things, cheating is infinitely worse than looking at someone's phone.", "I've been frustrated with my wife on plenty of occasions. She's been frustrated with me. Sometimes it's been about long-standing issues. Neither of us have ever responded by arcing to a conspiracy-theory-level accusation like this. Your mind doesn't go places like this unless you've had it simmering on the back burner for a while.\n\nThere are plenty of real a legitimate gripes in recent history in any marriage without jumping to 7 years back to things no rational person would ever think someone had done on purpose.", "OP should have explained it then to avoid the confusion.", "Why?", "I\u2019d agree with everyone else then and say NTA. Sounds like a heated argument where she said something while emotions were high to me, but only you know if she\u2019s like this often.", "Good to know, people are fast.", "You don't know me, but sure, it's fun calling strangers idiots. Let me explain, so hopefully, it makes sense to you why someone could be confused about the downpayment part. When you buy a new car, you have to pay a downpayment. OPs wife had to buy a new car after the accident, 3 or four sentences later she acuses OP of not paying the downpayment, OP did not specify the downpayment was for the original car, which for all we know she could have bought before they met, keep in mind they had only been together for 1 year when the crash happened. Does it now make sense to you why someone would be confused about the downpayment part?", "It's no offense, I appreciate your open honesty with my situation. Sometiems we need to hear these things even if we don't want too..", "Red flags suggesting cheating are: 1) Picking fights without a good reason 2) Staying at work late in a change from usual practice 3) Blatant disrespect  (\"If you were a real man\") - this one is the worst.  Look up Gottman's four horsemen presaging the death of a relationship - criticism and contempt are the first two.  \n\nI would put the over/under for an affair at 50%.  It's definitely possible that this is just a normal marital problem, but when a woman is having an emotional affair you usually see a change in behavior of this kind.  For your sake, I hope it's not that.  Literally anything else is less painful to deal with.  If it is an affair, she will not admit to it; she will simply burn the relationship down around your ears with increasingly outrageous behavior.  Cheating and lying go together like white and snow.  You seem like a nice guy... That's the kind of guy that gets cheated on.  Good luck, OP.", "Thank you for the laugh. It's been horrible day so far.", "Maybe in the future (and I hope there is a future) you could stop whatever you\u2019re doing or working on, and give her your undivided attention until you have helped solve her problems.", "He did.", "It\u2019s so relevant. Maybe you just think he should have specified?", "You don't need to know someone to make that judgement if they behave like you do.", "There is no down-payment on a replacement car from insurance...", "As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware of, in this country couples usually share all the expenses in their household. When I see your financial situation I automatically think she\u2019s saving every penny of her money to pack up and leave. Or maybe something even more nefarious than that. I would open my eyes and think very carefully about what is taking place in your household. Good luck!", "This is will be the new goal.", "Not in the original post, in the comments he did.", "Apparently, this sub is full of kids who haven't had to go through real situations yet. Thanks.", "Unless they give you the same car assuming they can find it, which in most cases they don't, insurance will reimburse you the value of the totaled car, you still have to go through the process of buying a new car..."]}
