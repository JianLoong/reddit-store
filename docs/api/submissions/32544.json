Hopefully can be resolved with communication but the working late, finding excuses to argue and then wanting a lump sum of cash would make me believe you need to confront her about this and get to the root cause of the problem because it doesn't sound like this is it unless she misunderstood how her insurance works...she doesn't get to keep a new car and the money she paid for the old one.", "NAH but it doesn\u2019t sound like your marriage is in a healthy place. This may be a window into other resentment she is holding or other things that she feels you are neglecting. You two need to do major repairs to your communication if something she was upset by 7 years ago is only being addressed now. Marriages live and die on communication and yours is in a very bad place and got to that very bad place shockingly fast.", "NTA.\n\nShe cared more for the car/money than your life?

Honestly, homie, I don\u2019t know what to say. But she did gaslight you. Hope everything works out tho. You didn\u2019t deserve that at all.", "NTA. Your wife is building a grudge for a reason unrelated to the car, her choice of words is very explicit about it :\u201dif you were a real man\u201d.

She sounds just a tad unhinged.", "INFO: what started the argument was over helping my wife on the computer. My wife was asking me to help her look over her world insurance and I was casually helping her and performing another task on my computer. My wife did not like that I did not stop what I was doing and directly help her. It sort of escalated to the car thing.", "Info: So we had gap insurance coverage and full coverage. The gap insurance covered the remainder of the payments left on the vehicle. My wife had 4000$ down payment on the vehicle which is what she wants recouped. My wife keeps her finance separate from me. I pay all the bills in the house, including food. My wife works full time making 60k a year and her only bills are her car. At the time she never asked me for the 4000$ which is why I'm so confused now.", "This is some good feedback. I had not really thought about some of things you have provided. Obviously I plan to discuss more with her later today. Hopefully what she says aligns more with what you have spelled out here, and less what I am dreading.", "Thank you for posting this. I was going to say way too much of this story is missing for a judgement. Everything you stated makes a lot more sense to this story. However, I still think 7 years is too long to hold onto a grudge even if you are correct about them not knowing each other well enough for her to speak her mind about what happened.", "Yes, my plan is to sit down with her after she leaves work and discuss why she never communicated this issue to me earlier. I do have a feeling the relationship is struggling,. We have recently had a string of fights lately. I just have never had her say something as cold as this before, so I had to leave the house before I broke down in front of her.", "My wife's cousin found out that her husband was having an affair while he was away on work trips, I think in 2015 ish. Obviously she flipped out and he accepted his fate. But they went into counseling and up until a year ago everyone thought they were fine. Suddenly he got suspicious that she was now cheating - tipped off by his own mother-in-law (ie the wife's mother). She was indeed cheating and later admitted it - but blamed it on him. She says she held a grudge for all this time and it was a rebellious counter-fuck (x many).\n\nObviously I can't condone what either of them did - they're as bad as each other now. They're separated, he has the kids 75% of the time, he's lost major clients, they've both lost a huge house in one of the posher parts of Los Angeles, she has to pay him a huge chunk of her paycheck (because he does most of the childcare), she's put on a ton of weight... life is fucked up sometimes. No win for either of them, nor the kids. A seven year grudge - although some relatives don't believe it.", "It was a red Mitsubishi cross over. I did not like the color or the body styling. Just a personal styling choice. She has always had a car before I met her. I have never told her that she could not have a car, or anything for that matter.", "Misogyny much?", "She does not normally say such mean things. This is why I am in so much shock. I hate to say this but she has been staying at work alot later lately then normal. I'm hoping there's not something else going on. She says it's just for work.", "Edit: details provided.

I pay all the bills in the house, including food. My wife works full time making 60k a year and her only bills are her car.\n\nYWBTA if you don't address why there's this huge disparity in your financial contributions given you keep your finances separately. Why are you paying all the bills -- even if you make much more money -- while she only has to pay for her car?", "Is it possible she meant that it\u2019s your fault instead of meaning you caused the crash on purpose.

I do not condone the actions of misogyny.", "Nice. Best of luck. It must have felt awful to have a car accident from seven years ago thrown back at you like that. Good on you for having the patience and persistence to stay calm and try and understand what's happening.", "This is what I\u2019m still confused about. Did she pay additional money as a result of the car accident or not? I don\u2019t understand how \u201c$4k as a down payment\u201d has any bearing on this. A down payment is the money you pay initially when making a large purchase and then monthly payments for the rest of the purchase price come after. Presumably, the car is completely replaced by insurance and the monthly payments continue. There\u2019s no new down payment to be made, monthly payments continue and the only new charge from the car accident is the insurance deductible. Is OP confusing the terms \u201cdeductible\u201d and \u201cdown payment\u201d?", "No, you\u2019re NTA - this person is wrong.\n\nAccidents happen.

I agreed with her because it was something we both wanted.", "My wife only pays for the car, because she always wants a brand new car, and I would only help her with a percentage of the down payment.", "Thank you.", "I hadn't thought of that. Other then her staying at work later recently , and our more recent fights , I have never really suspected her of cheating. I don't even know what I would be looking for.", "Do you really think so. What made you able to come to this conclusion so easily? Am I just blind here?", "I asked you elsewhere for more details.  There's no way she just randomly thinks you crashed the car on purpose.  Give us details about the accident, also what was this argument really about, etc\n\n\nEdit: details provided", "Yes, you are correct, it was just the down payment. All cost were covered on the car by gap and full coverage.", "If you have the ability, check her phone for suspicious messages.  Look up how to recover deleted messages first.  If there are any deleted messages, that's a major red flag already.  An affair partner may be under a woman's name if she is hiding it well.  You can also check the phone bill to look for many calls to a particular number.  If you notice anything suspicious, hire a PI to investigate.  They aren't cheap, but they are very thorough.", "1.

Starting a fight for no reason \\[CHECK\\]\n\nYou just cut her a check for $4K so she can use that monty for a hotel and lube to get crammed by some other dude. Sorry bro.", "Sorry forgot to include accident details. I was merging on to a highway going northbound. It was a location that had a yield on green light. I did not see the other car approaching and they hit me as I was merging. I believe because I told my wife that I did not like the car, that is why she suspects I destroyed it.", "The argument was about helping her go over her work insurance. She wanted my undivided attention, and I was performing some of my work functions while I helped her. I was not responding fast enough and she got upset. I asked her if I could help her after my work duties and she said she needed my help right away because the dead line was approaching. We just argued about me not always helping her because I am busy. When she bought the car I told her I did not like it. This I believe is the main reason why she thinks I did it on purpose.", "Could you try to explain the logic of how the down payment is relevant to the car accident then? I don\u2019t get it. She seems to be focused on money that is completely irrelevant. Is she ignorant on how finances work and that\u2019s why she\u2019s focused on an irrelevant sum of money? To my understanding, you should only be responsible for the insurance deductible.", "Do not fucking do this.", "Ignore these people. Not nearly enough evidence for this. Use your own instincts, don't get hyped up by people that don't know you or your partner.", "Sounds like a normal accident, not one thst would make a normal person think you wrecked it on purpose.", "So these are important details.  Is she often like this, wanting help RIGHT NOW despite you being literally busy with work?", "I wish I could explain it better. I am also baffled. She is from a very poor country and is not very knowledgeable about many things in my country. Her exact words were that she believes the car would have been paid off sooner if she would have gotten her down payment back or I wouldn't have wrecked it. Obviously I plan to sit down with her today and discuss more, but for now I am at a loss as well.", "You won't fool us OP's wife.", "Yes she does often require my help with difficult tasks right away. I must confess, I am often busy or preoccupied with work. I am sure this does not help. Also my wife is from another country and she does experience some reading difficulties and prejudice in my country.", "I think she believes you owe her money due to her financial illiteracy. NTA - It\u2019s not your fault that you didn\u2019t realize she held a grudge based on her misunderstanding of finances she didn\u2019t ask for clarification on."]}
