It's a lot of fun and I love kids so it's no hardship for me and while i've had a few bad experiences it's nothing that i've not been able to handle until a few days ago. I was babysitting for a couple while they went out to celebrate their anniversary.\n\nIt went great, their toddler was sweet if a little out of it, the reason for that became clear later as she was clearly unwell and began to throw up. I took care of her and comforted her while trying to contact her parents but there was no answer on the number they left behind. Not great but she seemed fine if a bit weepy so I went back to comforting her. Later on however she kept being sick and her temperature was beginning to spike. I tried to call them again but there was no answer and at this stage I was getting worried so I called the out of hours doctors. They tried to tell me I couldn't bring her down as not family but I explained the situation and how I couldn't contact them and I was panicking and they told me to bring her down. I fired them a text explaining what was going on but also figuring they were having phone troubles wrote a note and left it on the table.\n\nI was out at the Doctors three hours with her and by the time we got back to the house we were both exhausted and smelly from where she'd threw up on both of us at one stage. I'd cleaned us off as best as I could in the toilets at the doctors but gave her a bath, changed her into fresh PJ's and gave her the medicine the Doctor had given me for her. Once she was asleep I took a quick shower myself and changed into the spare clothes I keep in my car for emergencies. \n\nWhen her parents returned I filled them in on what had happened and what the Doctor had said, and that i'd bathed and changed her before getting her settled and that i'd taken a shower myself. They weren't apologetic at all and said their phone must have been on silent. They then paid me and I left and they acted very casual about the whole mess as if it hadn't been a night from hell for me. \n\nI will admit I was kind of upset and stressed still so when I got home I texted two of my friends who also babysit and warned them to not sit for that family, it had a bit of a domino affect as they ended up telling their friends who told their friends and so on. I had no idea the scale it had reached until I got a call from the Mother today demanding to know what i'd said and why no sitter will agree to watch her daughter this Saturday.\n\nI didn't intend for it to reach this scale and i'm a bit in shock wondering if maybe I went too far, AITA?", "created_utc": 1682020479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12td57b/aita_for_getting_a_family_blacklisted_by_all/", "score": 3297, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No way they didn't see you blowing up their phones.\n\nNobody should babysit for them. It's a huge safety risk for the poor child and for the sitter. If someone does...they need to demand a list of the places they will be and require an hourly check in.", "NTA  no parent should put their phone on silent, it was a dangerous thing to do. Kids can go bad fast - I'm surprised the hospital didn't try to call them to get permission to treat. You were right telling the other sitters, they didn't seem to care when you told them so I suspect that \"accidentally\" putting their phone on silent is not a new behavior.", "NTA. One or two missed calls I could understand, but dozens of unanswered calls over a period of hours? That\u2019s intentional, and it\u2019s negligent. My guess is that they knew she was sick and didn\u2019t tell you, probably because they figured you wouldn\u2019t want to babysit a severely ill kid. \n\nYou did everything right, and I\u2019m really amazed at how well you stepped up to support that poor baby.", "[deleted]", "NTA. It isn't your fault they are shitty parents. \n\nLook, sometimes kids get sick, and sometimes phones don't work like they should, but I doubt that is the case at all here. \n\nBest guess?  They knew their kid was sick, but would rather have a night off than deal with a sick kid. So they doped her up hoping you wouldn't notice, left, turned off their phones, and went about their evening. \n\nYou did the right thing, you did what you had to do to take care of the little girl. You were also right in telling your friends, I would have. The whole situation sucked for you, and your friends deserved a warning. \n\nAs for the mother... If she had been an actual mother to begin with, she wouldn't have had this result. I wouldn't feel any sorrow for her.\n\nHell, I might actually consider making a call CPS over the whole mess. As described, it is actual parental negligence.", "NTA.\n\nPeople forget that situations like this are a two way street in terms of reputation and word of mouth. All you did is tell the truth.

This isn't on you, you did everything you could to contact these parents and they couldn't be bothered. Assuming you didn't exaggerate the story to your friends, the babysitters of the local area decided amongst themselves that it wasn't worth the hassle of dealing with this family, and that's all assuming that you were the first one to have this kind of interaction with them (it likely wasn't, people who do this, do so repeatedly).", "NTA and frankly, the parents were giant AHs! Putting their phones on silent while someone else is watching thei kid??? wtf does that?!", "NTA - Do parents not check in on their kids and how things are going?  Text or call?

As for when the mother called, I would have flat out told her what I said, and why I said it.", "NTA\nYou told your friends what happened because it was a very scary and unusual occurrence (parents usually listen out for calls from the babysitter).

Just to check in.  And this was back in the age where cell phones and beepers weren't a widespread thing.\n\nSo if my mom could find land lines in the 80's to check in on her kids, this woman could have kept her phone turned on in case of emergencies.", "NTA.   Its sort of like a YELP review.   You told the truth about what happened and word got around.   Too bad, so sad for these irresponsible parents.", "NTA. Those parents are downright negligent.", "NTA - If it happened to you, it's your story to tell to whomever and whenever.   What others do it on them.", "NTA!!! As a parent, your child's caretaker should always have access to you in case of emergencies. The fact that they weren't even apologetic tells you all you need to know.

You didn't threaten or coerce anyone into refusing to babysit for them. \n\nFWIW, sometimes it's not always obvious that a kid is getting a stomach bug. My own kids have very suddenly thrown up without any warning. They genuinely could have not known that she would get sick later on. Vomiting and fever aren't typically reasons to rush to the doctor, especially after only a few hours. The parents could've told you all of that if they had *answered their phone* (hopefully while quickly making their way back home), but I figured it was worth mentioning if it could help ease your mind in future babysitting gigs!", "NTA\nYou told your friends what happened because it was a very scary and unusual occurrence (parents usually listen out for calls from the babysitter).

They 100% knew she was sick.", "NTA - You sound like a great babysitter. They deserve to be blackballed.", "ESH.\nThe parents clearly should not have left you with sick child, should have answer d the phone and should have paid you extra\n\nYou would be in your rights to describe what happened to you and let your friends make a choice( for example did you overreact to something simple or did parents put you in unattainable situation). However, you chose to simply warn the people not to babysit for that family( based on your post) By the time the story reached the wider babysitters crowd they probably were convinced that the parents left you with 3 kids for full months and did not pay you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s plenty of parents that take advantage of their babysitters**. The real question you need to ask yourself is can you live with yourself better if you allowed tens other nanny\u2019s +  experiencing what you did, or worse with them because you didn\u2019t say a word. Or can you live with yourself better if the mom has a slightly harder time finding a nanny because they\u2019re all well informed of what they\u2019re be getting themselves into. **Them having a bad reputation also doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll never find childcare again, it just means that the next person they hire will be aware and know what boundaries/rules to set in place**. \n\n**It also forces the parents to be more responsible and treat whatever babysitter they get well, because they know they\u2019ll have a hard time finding another one**. Second, and this is pure speculation but based on previous experience. The parents knew she was sick, i was a nanny/babysitter for 10 years and grew up raising my 3 younger siblings. You not only know when your kid is actively sick, but they\u2019re coming down with something. **Theres no way they didn\u2019t notice her acting different, or showing any physical symptoms period. They just didn\u2019t care, about her or about what that meant for you. I get parents want/needs breaks but that doesn\u2019t mean they get to manipulate or lie their way into getting one**. At the end of the day no one owes them that break, and then being deceptive to get one will only bite them.. and it is. \n\n\n**Their lack of shock at hearing you had to drive her to the doctor said everything as well, if she wasn\u2019t Ill they\u2019d be up your ass worried, asking questions, etc. They likely gave her an OTC medicine to hide her symptoms long enough that you wouldn\u2019t notice until they were gone**. It\u2019s happened to me and plenty of other friends that worked as nanny/babysitters, etc. If I were you I\u2019d just block the parents number and forget about her.

Don\u2019t do it, it\u2019s not fair to anyone else she may try to get to watch her kids to not be aware of their past. You\u2019re a good person and you did the right thing.

I complained to my friends and warned them off of babysitting for this family because not only were they unreachable for hours, I had my suspicions they knew their child was sick and did this on purpose and they showed a lack of care or surprise despite knowing the teenager babysitting for them had to rush their toddler to an out of hours GP.

When I was babysitting regularly I had a certain purse for it that came in with me. It had a small first aid kit + some games + phone charger.

In fact most daycares have a \"no sick children\" clause in the contract so the parents know they're handing a kid over under false pretenses. When you leave child with someone who did not agree to watch them that counts as abandonment.\n\nYou're all trash to daycare workers. They really should go on strike and we'd see how well society would cope with that.", "My native language isnt English at all, GP isn't used for the \"first line doctor\" you generally go to, but on international subs I use the term GP.

Tierney\u2019s anguish over her daughter\u2019s condition was compounded when a female fan later approached her to tell her that she had broken her quarantine for German measles to see Tierney at the Hollywood Canteen. Everyone always said that Tierney was even more beautiful in person than in front of a camera, and this woman had wanted to see her in the flesh, not on the screen. Stunned, Tierney said nothing and just walked away. \u201cAfter that I didn\u2019t care whether ever again I was anyone\u2019s favorite actress,\u201d she wrote in her pained 1979 autobiography *Self-Portrait.*", "Before the pandemic, I used to decline the event/travel insurance on most bookings that offered it, but I started buying it on *everything* once things started opening back up.", "I suppose it's something that could and did happen to unfortunate women (I knew one growing up), but the similarities between Gene Tierney and Christie's Marina were a tad on the nose!\n\nAnd I can't imagine how hearing that story from her fan felt.", "NTA. Sorry to all the parents out there but parents don\u2019t get to put their phones on silent unless with their children. Having a babysitter (even if it\u2019s family-grandma/grandpa) doesn\u2019t mean the phones go silent. You can put them on vibrate or if you have an iPhone on dnd but allow favorites to still come through. It sucks because it\u2019s a thankless job but parenting is 24/7.

Sorry, but even if you're having the very best time, you check your phone while your partner is in the loo. \nComimghome to learn their baby was sick enough to be taken to the doctors amd not being beside thdmselves with worry.\nNot apologising profusely for your ordeal and giving you a massive bonus for your troubles.\n\n\nI conclude, you were completely right to have them blacklisted, they should have to go through an agency that enforces some rules.", "NTA\nBeing an ethical hacker, I checked some info about this case. After playing with some IPs I found that the couple was having a quality time and wild fetishes s*x in a motel.\nAlso OP while checking some info I'll say one thing to you, beware of Emily.", "NTA they absolutely knew she was sick before they left the house and there is no way that with a new baby sitter at home they wouldn\u2019t have checked their phones. They did that shit on purpose", "NTA. They parents were uncontactable for HOURS and didn't check in with you at all. They should be blacklisted.", "This is so sad. So many people that have children shouldn\u2019t. Definitely NTA. I wouldn\u2019t ever 1. Have a baby sitter watch my son if he was sick in anyway 2.

Poor baby I hope she\u2019s starting to feel better !:(", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s a pair of irresponsible parents right there. You were an angel the way you took care of their kid, and god forbid next time it\u2019s something worse.\n\nBabysitters are not doctors, but you handled the situation very well during the night in question.\n\nAs for the blacklisting, I understand it, and it\u2019s not like you went out of your way - word of mouth travels and it sounds like a babysitting nightmare so hopefully it\u2019ll force them to reflect on their behaviour and do better.", "Also, it\u2019s unbelievable that they may have medicated her and not told you about that. What if the doctor gave her more medicine that interacted badly with the meds she\u2019d already taken?!", "NTA. Two things: you didn't actively go out and campaign against these people. It was a situation where you told 2 friends and they thought it was serious enough to tell others. And I think you're right that there is something really wrong with the way these parents acted.", "NTA.\n\nThey were ignoring you. I dont care how good a time youre having, if youre a parents and your child is being babysat, you regularly check your phone. Especially if its on silent.\n\nThe amount of hours they went without sparing a single thought for their child is insane.", "NTA.\n\nIt's as simple as consequences of actions.\n\n1. Very unlikely their phone was on silent, most parents would check texts or send one.\n2. Not apologetic or grateful for going above and beyond.\n3. IF it were me, I'd be throwing extra money at you.\n4. Their disregard for the situation on their kid indicates bad things are likely to happen and can get other babysitters in drama/trouble.\n\nI'm interested what you said in response to them. If I knew them through other people and gave a hoot, I would honestly tell them those are the reasons people don't want to lend their services to them so they had a chance to correct themselves.", "NTA.

We really appreciate your expert care with our Child!\u201d", "NTA, if the child already seemed unwell, fuck them, they still go out even though there child is sick, and don't warn you at all, and aren't even apologetic after wards, they deserved to be black listed if they don't even bother to look after there own child enough to keep them well or to take care of them when there sick.", "NTA\n\nI'm not a mother, but I wouldn't turn my phone silent if I had my child at home, in case of an emergency or the babysitter not finding something they need.\n\nI was an au pair, and I talked to the au apir that was currently at the family I was interviewed by, because nobody can give you a better insight in a babysitting situation than a babysitter who currently works for the family. You probably saved someone from a lot of stress, if the family can't even stress enough to care for their own child bein sick, no matter if they have a date night or their phones were on \"silent\".", "NTA. You were a saint. The parents were negligent.", "NTA. They intentionally ignored you to continue their night without interruption. I also firmly believe they knew their kid was sick before you go there - you know when your kid doesn\u2019t feel good. You were right to warn your friends and they were right to warn theirs and so on. They\u2019re toxic parents who don\u2019t seem to care about their kid at all. And I say this as a former babysitter/nanny and a parent now.", "NTA I would take all the evidence you have (call logs, texts, doctors notes) of her being sick and the parents straight ignoring you and take it to CPS and see what happens  \nalso next time, call the cops and tell them what's up and you need hep finding the parents", "I run a daycare and actually had to fire a parent because he kept sending me his kid sick and then that kid would make others sick causing their parents to take time off work and me losing money.

They\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t call the police or something because you couldn\u2019t get a hold of them and she was sick.

Do they even care about the child?", "It was free. Emergencies like that are usually free in my country too, and common meds are quite cheap.", "I'd like to add that slip covers for the thermometer for separate use is something I'd recommend. The fingers of the food gloves are perfect, and they are five per glove. I'm talking about the really cheap cafeteria servers gloves, not those neoprene ones.

After two years of not getting it.... so sad we couldnt go.", "My boss did that with his kids: wife was home and infected, eldest showed symptoms. He brought the kids anyways, I guess to give her rest but still negligent to the shy 9 yr old. I think 5/12 people at the table, myself included, got our first positives since quarantining started. It was our first dinner outing, so who knows who else it may have effected in the restaurant?", "My husband and i got covid in July and i told his parents, who we live with, and they invited my brother in law, his not even yet 1 year old at the time, and his pregnant wife to quarantine with the family. They still left and did things while my husband and i were holed up (as we should) and i was so mad. By the time my husband and I recovered they all had covid and my niece was in the hospital because of double pneumonia that covid caused. My brother in law acknowledged their screw up and left for their own house after everything happened and my MIL was acting like it was the end of the world and i couldn't help but think... If as soon as I called and said he tested positive and everyone stayed in their own respective houses then would it have infected every single one of you? \n\nMoral of the story is stay home and don't invite people to quarantine with you even if they had been around for five minutes."]}
