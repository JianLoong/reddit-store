It's a lot of fun and I love kids so it's no hardship for me and while i've had a few bad experiences it's nothing that i've not been able to handle until a few days ago. I was babysitting for a couple while they went out to celebrate their anniversary.\n\nIt went great, their toddler was sweet if a little out of it, the reason for that became clear later as she was clearly unwell and began to throw up. I took care of her and comforted her while trying to contact her parents but there was no answer on the number they left behind. Not great but she seemed fine if a bit weepy so I went back to comforting her. Later on however she kept being sick and her temperature was beginning to spike. I tried to call them again but there was no answer and at this stage I was getting worried so I called the out of hours doctors. They tried to tell me I couldn't bring her down as not family but I explained the situation and how I couldn't contact them and I was panicking and they told me to bring her down. I fired them a text explaining what was going on but also figuring they were having phone troubles wrote a note and left it on the table.\n\nI was out at the Doctors three hours with her and by the time we got back to the house we were both exhausted and smelly from where she'd threw up on both of us at one stage. I'd cleaned us off as best as I could in the toilets at the doctors but gave her a bath, changed her into fresh PJ's and gave her the medicine the Doctor had given me for her. Once she was asleep I took a quick shower myself and changed into the spare clothes I keep in my car for emergencies. \n\nWhen her parents returned I filled them in on what had happened and what the Doctor had said, and that i'd bathed and changed her before getting her settled and that i'd taken a shower myself. They weren't apologetic at all and said their phone must have been on silent. They then paid me and I left and they acted very casual about the whole mess as if it hadn't been a night from hell for me. \n\nI will admit I was kind of upset and stressed still so when I got home I texted two of my friends who also babysit and warned them to not sit for that family, it had a bit of a domino affect as they ended up telling their friends who told their friends and so on. I had no idea the scale it had reached until I got a call from the Mother today demanding to know what i'd said and why no sitter will agree to watch her daughter this Saturday.\n\nI didn't intend for it to reach this scale and i'm a bit in shock wondering if maybe I went too far, AITA?", "created_utc": 1682020479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12td57b/aita_for_getting_a_family_blacklisted_by_all/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No way they didn't see you blowing up their phones.\n\nNobody should babysit for them. It's a huge safety risk for the poor child and for the sitter. If someone does...they need to demand a list of the places they will be and require an hourly check in.", "NTA  no parent should put their phone on silent, it was a dangerous thing to do. Kids can go bad fast - I'm surprised the hospital didn't try to call them to get permission to treat. You were right telling the other sitters, they didn't seem to care when you told them so I suspect that \"accidentally\" putting their phone on silent is not a new behavior.", "NTA. One or two missed calls I could understand, but dozens of unanswered calls over a period of hours? That\u2019s intentional, and it\u2019s negligent. My guess is that they knew she was sick and didn\u2019t tell you, probably because they figured you wouldn\u2019t want to babysit a severely ill kid. \n\nYou did everything right, and I\u2019m really amazed at how well you stepped up to support that poor baby.", "NTA  Don't mess with the nanny network and never jerk around your baby sitter!  Those parents left knowing their child was unwell and chose not to answer their phone because they could not be bothered. All you did was give a couple of friends a heads up that this couple was problematic. If word gets around, they have no else to blame but themselves.", "NTA. It isn't your fault they are shitty parents. \n\nLook, sometimes kids get sick, and sometimes phones don't work like they should, but I doubt that is the case at all here. \n\nBest guess?  They knew their kid was sick, but would rather have a night off than deal with a sick kid. So they doped her up hoping you wouldn't notice, left, turned off their phones, and went about their evening. \n\nYou did the right thing, you did what you had to do to take care of the little girl. You were also right in telling your friends, I would have. The whole situation sucked for you, and your friends deserved a warning. \n\nAs for the mother... If she had been an actual mother to begin with, she wouldn't have had this result. I wouldn't feel any sorrow for her.\n\nHell, I might actually consider making a call CPS over the whole mess. As described, it is actual parental negligence.", "NTA.\n\nPeople forget that situations like this are a two way street in terms of reputation and word of mouth. All you did is tell the truth. If every other sitter out there is putting that info to use(and possibly using what else they have heard about this couple) to choose not to work with them, oh well welcome to the free market and independent contractors.", "NTA - You shared facts. Parents would not respond to a critical update: an ill child. Their casual demeanor is wildly concerning. If the word rippled not in their favor they created the outcome. Best to you!", "Oh my god. What parent goes out like that and doesn\u2019t answer their phone? Silent? With a babysitter watching their child. JFC - NTA. I\u2019d certainly have appreciated knowing this as a babysitter. Who wants to go through that kind of drama.", "NTA, at the start I was worried this was gonna be about a concussed toddler and the parents tried to blame you, but it sounds like she was just sick so I'm glad to hear that. This isn't on you, you did everything you could to contact these parents and they couldn't be bothered. Assuming you didn't exaggerate the story to your friends, the babysitters of the local area decided amongst themselves that it wasn't worth the hassle of dealing with this family, and that's all assuming that you were the first one to have this kind of interaction with them (it likely wasn't, people who do this, do so repeatedly).", "NTA and frankly, the parents were giant AHs! Putting their phones on silent while someone else is watching thei kid??? wtf does that?!", "NTA - Do parents not check in on their kids and how things are going?  Text or call?  Check to see if any messages have come in?  BS their phone was on silent, they ignored your issues and their child.  As for when the mother called, I would have flat out told her what I said, and why I said it.", "NTA\nYou told your friends what happened because it was a very scary and unusual occurrence (parents usually listen out for calls from the babysitter). Whatever happened after that isn\u2019t on you.\n\nIf she pays at least double the going rate she\u2019s bound to find some takers", "NTA\n\nignoring what was obviously a medical emergency tells volumes about what kind of parents, and people, they really are.", "NTA\n\nMy mom used to call the sitter once or twice when she was out with my dad.  Just to check in.  And this was back in the age where cell phones and beepers weren't a widespread thing.\n\nSo if my mom could find land lines in the 80's to check in on her kids, this woman could have kept her phone turned on in case of emergencies.", "NTA.   Its sort of like a YELP review.   You told the truth about what happened and word got around.   Too bad, so sad for these irresponsible parents.", "NTA. Those parents are downright negligent.", "NTA - If it happened to you, it's your story to tell to whomever and whenever.   What others do it on them.", "NTA!!! As a parent, your child's caretaker should always have access to you in case of emergencies. The fact that they weren't even apologetic tells you all you need to know. I would block her messages and just not waste time responding to her.", "NTA as long as you relayed the facts to your friends.  You can't control who they tell or what they said.\n\nMaybe the mom should have shown a bit more appreciation for all you did.", "NTA\n\nYou told a couple of friends an honest account of what happened. You didn't threaten or coerce anyone into refusing to babysit for them. \n\nFWIW, sometimes it's not always obvious that a kid is getting a stomach bug. My own kids have very suddenly thrown up without any warning. They genuinely could have not known that she would get sick later on. Vomiting and fever aren't typically reasons to rush to the doctor, especially after only a few hours. The parents could've told you all of that if they had *answered their phone* (hopefully while quickly making their way back home), but I figured it was worth mentioning if it could help ease your mind in future babysitting gigs!", "NTA\nYou told your friends what happened because it was a very scary and unusual occurrence (parents usually listen out for calls from the babysitter). Whatever happened after that isn\u2019t on you.\n\nIf she pays at least double the going rate she\u2019s bound to find some takers", "going out leaving her daughter and have the phone on silent? no parent should do this. besides it's not possible that she would not know that the kid was sick. this kind of thinks do not escalate in 2 or 3 hours.\n\nthey should be blacklisted\n\nNTA", "They want to go out again knowing their child's unwell so.. nta", "NTA. These are terrible people. You were right to warn others. You did nothing wrong. You were a better parent to that poor child than they are.", "NTA.  Who doesn't check their phone when they're out and their toddler is with a new babysitter? Or any babysitter? Especially if they're feeling unwell?", "NTA. They 100% knew she was sick.", "NTA - You sound like a great babysitter. They deserve to be blackballed.", "ESH.\nThe parents clearly should not have left you with sick child, should have answer d the phone and should have paid you extra\n\nYou would be in your rights to describe what happened to you and let your friends make a choice( for example did you overreact to something simple or did parents put you in unattainable situation). However, you chose to simply warn the people not to babysit for that family( based on your post) By the time the story reached the wider babysitters crowd they probably were convinced that the parents left you with 3 kids for full months and did not pay you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
