It's a 3 bedroom apartment, so we just have a common living area to share, meaning a living room, dining room, and a small kitchen.\n\nWhen we first moved in together, we started off sharing dishes, mostly because we have a small kitchen and partially because Nancy didn't really have many dishes (any cups or plates or regular bowls).\n\nNancy frequently left stuck on food on my dishes that I let her use. This led to food being gummed onto my dishes after being put through our shitty dishwasher. I addressed this 10 times verbally (face to face) over 6 months, and nothing ever changed.\n\nThe last time I addressed this, I made it clear that if Nancy didn't change, something about our dishes situation would have to change. Less than a week later, there was still no effort.\n\nSo I separated my dishes from the rest. I picked 2 cabinets and a drawer to store my things (we have 3 drawers and 8 cabinets for dishes total), and moved things around so that my stuff was in those places alone. I texted both my roommates not to use my dishes anymore.\n\nI admit that I should've been way more clear in my message and should've clarified that I moved the kitchen around to reflect this separation.\n\nWhen Nancy got home that day, she flipped. Started freaking out, almost crying because she would not get to use my non stick pans anymore (which she had previously scratched horribly without apology). She was extremely upset that I moved things without warning her. She was also extremely upset that I was using the kitchen for storage for stuff that was not communal anymore, even though I made sure to use less than 1/3 of our storage as 1/3 of the people living there.\n\nWe came to the agreement that if Nancy could properly clean dishes for a month, we would try to reintegrate. We put in a system to hopefully get dishes done by every evening.\n\nA month later, no old food caked on dishes (although I'm cautious because she basically didn't eat anything that could be stuck on in this time, and spent every weekend almost out of town). Great!\n\nA month after that, we are here today with Nancy demanding that I reorganize the dishes back to exactly how they were before the separation 2 months ago. Specifically that I do it. I told her it would be a cold day in hell before I did that myself, but she could do it herself to her heart's content. She insisted that she would not take on such a massive undertaking (it took me an hour and a half previously, and I organized the stuff pretty thoroughly while I was at it).\n\nAfter I said \"no\" to her demand, she left that house meeting early, saying \"I'm not dealing with this tonight\".\n\nI'm not crazy right? AITA?\n\nAlso, WTF do I do? How do I handle this?\n\nEdit: forgot to clarify that after the 1 month trial period, we did go back to shared dishes.", "created_utc": 1668173521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysal2h/aita_because_i_separated_my_dishes_from_my/", "score": 192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have Nancy plenty of opportunities to clean the dishes properly, and she has not stuck to her end of the agreement. She also ruined your cookware.

Do not let her use your dishes. She can buy her own to desecrate.", "NTA Any self respecting person would have done the same. Honestly, everything should have been separated from the moment a roommate situation became involved. It keeps sooo  many issues at bay. IF you decide to go back to letting her use your stuff (which I wouldn't after that temper tantrum), leave the kitchen separated as is. Reorganizing is unnecessary as it's not really an inconvenience to anyone but maybe her ego as it points out it isn't her property. If she decides to be disrespectful again you don't have to deal with separating your belongings again as it was never reintegrated as communal property even if treated as such.\n\nShe is definitely TA and disrespectful at best.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t treat your things with respect, even after several conversations. Also, she doesn\u2019t have a right to use your things because you\u2019re roommates.
