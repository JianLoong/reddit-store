My wife (a teacher) is due to finish Maternity leave and go back to work in a week and my parents have offered to watch him during the day while we are at work. I work from home part time 8 months out of the year, my wife is on a teachers schedule. We had a discussion with my parents and went over our rules and requests for watching our son.\n\nSome examples\n\n\u00b7 No taking him places, out on a walk is okay, but not to a busy store, hair appointments, etc.\n\n\u00b7 Only feed him breastmilk\n\n\u00b7 Keep him on a schedule\n\n\u00b7 Let us introduce solid foods \u2013 wifes family has a history of allergies\n\n\u00b7 No dogs around him\n\n\u00b7 Let us know anything you need while he spends 8 hours a day at Grandma/Grandpa\u2019s\n\n\u00b7 If anyone is sick let us know\n\nShe didn\u2019t have an issue with anything except the no dogs rule.\n\nI grew up with dogs, and didn\u2019t care for them. Had a girlfriend in college that had dogs and they were the most annoying thing in the world. Another couple friend we have had their kid bit by a dog. So wife and I agreed no dogs around our son.\n\nMy parents currently do not have any pets and haven\u2019t for about 15 years. My sister travels a lot for work.  Occasionally they watch my sisters dogs, who are okay trained I guess. This is the main reason for my rule. I choose to not be around them enough to know what they are like.  My mom said this would effectively not allow my sisters dogs at my parents anymore. Apparently my mom watches my sisters dogs more than I thought.\n\nWell, my mom let me sister know this and my sister has been blowing up my phone. The dogs are still allowed at my mom\u2019s house, just not when my son is over. My mom wants to watch my son more than my sisters dogs. It seems my sister is pissed she can\u2019t just drop off the dogs whenever she wants anymore.\n\nEdit:  FWIW, my mom approached me about watching my son. We didn't approach her. The no dogs rule was unexpected to her though.

No one has to like or want to have pets.

It's not gonna affect you and your annoyance with them. It has zero to do with your college girlfriend. And yeah, dogs can bite, but it doesn't sound like you know anything about your sister's dogs and their temperament. Your infant is gonna spend most of the first 6 months in a crib, in arms, or a pack n play. So there's plenty of time to figure out if the dogs shouldn't be around it or vice versa.", "YTA", "Edit: I saw you comment that even crated or in a separate area, you wouldn't tolerate it, which puts you into YTA territory. Being this against dogs and so unwilling to compromise shows a rigidity that is unkind to your family and won't do your son any favours.\n\nN A H. This is tough and I do sympathize. This is coming from a hardcore dog lover who has both fur and human children.\n\nI understand the desire to prevent an unknown quantity like dogs around your kid. But, I think in going this extreme you're going to foster a fear of dogs in your child and seriously limit his life. How long would you expect this rule to last? Forever? Just a few years? Will you leave a park if a dog is there? Will you ban your child from playdates in homes with dogs?\n\nAnd introducing him to dogs now can have several benefits: he can learn how to appropriately interact with them; if these dogs are aggressive around him, it's easier to learn that when he's easily portable and can be safely removed from their reach; it will lessen the likelihood that he'll develop a phobia of dogs. Frankly, dogs are usually very good with infants - the toddler years are where it gets tough. Speaking specifically about your sister's dogs, if they get used to your son as an infant and watch him grow up, they'll likely be more tolerant when he's older. \n\nAre you familiar with these dogs? Are they trained? Can you do a period of observation where both your son and the dogs are present to see if the dynamic is appropriate?\n\nDogs are everywhere and it's hard to imagine living such a controlled life that a child wouldn't interact with them. It's your child, so you get to make the final call, and keeping him away from dogs wouldn't make you the AH, but I do strongly encourage you to give it a fair shot before you draw such a hard line. I think it will, at the very least, make things smoother with your family.", "YTA. So confining parents to home or play ground and no dogs. Are you paying them??", "Good intentions but YTA\n\nYour couple of your requests are unreasonable. Not allowing your parents to go places with your son is rough on them.

Your fear is irrational and your hate for dogs is petty as it stems from being around 2 dogs that were poorly trained. I'm sure your parents aren't irresponsible enough to leave the child alone with the dogs, also I'm sure the dogs are well behaved enough to be trusted not to be unpredictably aggressive. \nYou and your wife are projecting irrational fears onto your child and bubble wrapping it unnecessarily.\nAlso remember, these people raised you, it's not their first rodeo. You trust them to care for your child, so have enough respect to trust they wouldn't be careless and endanger your child. You're essentially saying you don't trust them.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking them to lock up a current pet. \n\nIt sucks for your sister, but if your mom wants to watch baby then that\u2019s just a fact of life that you have such a simple request.", "I mean if your mom is choosing your son, you aren\u2019t ah ,  but the rules are a bit ridiculous,  and your mom is an ah to your sister", "NTA\n\nA bunch of people seem to be glossing over the fact that you didn\u2019t ask your parents to watch the kid, they asked to be able to have that time with your kid.  Completely reasonable for you to set the rules for your baby.  Your mom chose the kid over the dogs, also not your fault.  Sucks for your sister, but it\u2019s not your fault that you mom is more interested in the kid than her dogs.", "NTA I'm a dog owner and my dog is extremely well behaved and well trained because I invested considerable amount of time training her, while working from home and being around her 24/7, and she's also a highly intelligent and loyal working cattledog breed. I've learned from trying to socialize her with other people's dogs that not all dogs are as reliably well behaved. \n\nEven my dog, as well trained as she is, needs to be supervised and occasionally has natural instincts that cannot be trained out of the animal. I have had my dog around my friends under two-year old, and their kid would swat and pull and hit, and if the dog reacts instinctually to defend itself it doesn't know any better than the kid does that it's not okay to bite back. \n\nDogs also regard small children as any other human, but are confused by their chaotic behavior, dogs don't know the difference and don't understand that babies are underdeveloped humans. They don't give them the same latitude that we give babies for lack of understanding, a kid throwing hands at a dog is going to get the same reaction as a dog would react to an adult human abusing them. \n\nSo yeah, it's perfectly reasonable to say while someone else is caring for your child and you already have to suspend your concerns and worries while you are not around, that animals are not a tolerable risk, no matter how well trained the dog is. \n\nAnd to respond to everyone else accusing you of displacing your sister's dogs, it sounds like the grandparents have a very sane priority to spend time with and care for their grandchild which is an infinitely more important than dog sitting, which literally anyone on earth can do, it's way cheaper to board a dog than to hire a babysitter or send your child to daycare which usually costs one of the parents entire annual salary. \n\nSo unless your sister is constantly travelling for days on end she can crate an animal for a standard work day if she can't trust them to roam the house, but you can't crate a human being and you can't trust someone more than your own flesh and blood to care for your child. Dumping the dogs on your parents to take a vacation or weekend trip is not the same as generational childcare saving the family tens of thousands of dollars per year. The childcare is a natural familial responsibility, dog ownership is just a privilege. \n\nYour family doesn't have any responsibility to your sister's dogs. Last time I needed a dog sitter and didn't want to inconvenience anyone with checking on her, I hired a service which cost under $50 a day to feed and fetch with her 3 times a day. I know plenty of people that board the dog when they have to be gone longer than 12 hours. \n\nThere's plenty of options for dog care, but a human child is infinitely more important to ensure health and safety. Period. Not every grandparent is perfect but it sounds like you trust your folks and they'll do right by you child, and you're extremely lucky in that respect.\n\nForget about the friggin dogs.", "YTA.

Even if it's not a real bite, if I'm not present for the incident it's their word about what happened. It's a recipe for disaster if neither parent nor the dogs rightful bonded owner are around. \n\nMy point is don't put the grandparents in a situation with so many risks.

My guess is OP either doesn\u2019t really trust the parents to look after the baby properly and is using the dog thing as an excuse, or has some bizarre control issues. \n\nA phobia of dogs is possible too, I suppose, as that would explain the OP\u2019s reluctance to elaborate. But it still hardly excuses imposing those rules on the parents for babysitting.", "That\u2019s what compromise is for. I wouldn\u2019t budge for a dude who doesn\u2019t want to compromise. He is set to save 1000s in child care and he won\u2019t compromise to keep that? \n\nI would prefer the dogs to a screaming, soggy child. He can pay a sitter if the dogs are such a problem.", "The baby is four months old, it can't go opening doors and gates and investigating things. Unless the parents can't keep a door/gate/crate closed or the dogs are known escape artists who can open doors with their mouths, it'll be fine. A baby that young shouldn't be unattended unless they're in a crib or something, which the dogs can't get to, almost certainly in a room with a door that closes, which the dogs can't open. So yeah, it's very easy to keep a four month old and a dog apart. An older kid might get trickier, but still manageable.", "Baby gates and doors exist.", "I had 5 dogs in a 2 bedroom house when my son was a newborn it is in fact very easy to keep them separated.", "Uh... yes it is a favor. If I offer to help a friend out - just because I offer instead of them asking, that doesn't change the fact that it's a favor. And OP doesn't care what breed of dog - because he simply doesn't like dogs himself, so he won't even stand having them in the house but in a different room.", "OP's edit says his mother reached out to watch the baby, not the other way around.", "Because he doesn\u2019t want his baby in a house at the same time as a dog. Dander, germs, slobber, fleas, ticks- all legit reasons to not want dogs in the house where your child is being cared for- even in another room. \n\nI totally get that some people are dog people and find these risks worthwhile in order to have homes with pets and kids. Others that think the risk is minimal so who cares? But why would dog owners just EXPECT everyone else to feel the same way? Some people just don\u2019t want dogs around, and their stance is also valid. Some see a fur baby, some see a public nuisance. \n\nI applaud OP for sticking to their guns on an issue they care about for their kid.", "That\u2019s definitely a good point", " No he isn\u2019t.\n\nHe isn\u2019t asking them to watch his son, they asking him to watch him.\n\nHe can choose the environment his son is raised in.", "I think you\u2019re confused. The discussion I\u2019m having with far-jugger includes one as a response to their comment.", "She doesn't have to choose though? That's the rules for having him at her house surely she could also go and spend time with him at his parents ? And I've had to deal with a mum personally that had to completely take over from my brother over dog care, he got one without knowing how much time they take up, and guess what she had to take the dog in and now has full time because he got a dog without knowing them commitment. And they will be exposed to dogs at some point but we're talking about a 3 month old baby, one bite and a dog can't kill a child that age, and it can happen even if the dog is well behaved, I've seen it time and time again and it's not a risk I'd be willing to take.\n\nAlso let's say the dog could be caged or in a different room, what's to say the sister doesn't come round and let it out ? She's already reacted in not the best way already.", "How am I? He doesn't feel safe with a dog around his 3 month old and that's within his right , so if he leg the baby go there near the dog anf it ended up attacking the baby who's fault would that be?", "It was a brand new dog to me.\n\nAnd there are consequences for letting dogs jump on people, you are supposed to be in control of your dog. \n\nI still feel bad about it, but it was a reflex, and so I\u2019d probably do it again.", "People make errors. Especially grandparents wrangling dogs who don't belong to them, and a baby that they're not used to having in their home.", "A lot of people are irrationally afraid of or hate dogs. That's okay because they are their own person. But OPs parents are doing him a favor and he won't even compromise in a situation where his fears (kid getting bitten) aren't a possibility. \n\nDoes he not trust his parents at all that dogs can't even be in the vicinity? If so, this could be a serious issue aside from the obvious YTA.", "I was scared of dogs after my grandparents large dog knocked me over as a baby.  For three years the dog was behind a dog gate until i liked him.  Problem.solved when we visited.", "I didn\u2019t questions that.", "Early exposure to pet allergens is more likely to develop tolerance. And the degree of exposure is minimal if they are in different spaces. Also it clearly isn't actually about that - the dog is in the house on other days. So if this was about allergens and pests, those things can all carry over day to day. In essence your argument doesn't make sense of this situation.", "Dander and germs help prevent future allergies - from one with a ton of allergies.", "It's not their house, they have no right to tell someone what is allowed in their own home. They knew mom pet sits and purposely created an ultimatum. Pay a babysitter to come to your house where it is, in fact, your rules. OP, YTA, making your mom choose between you and your sister is shitty.", "Because this is Reddit where dogs are sacred and children are pests. \ud83d\ude44", "Yes, he can - doesn\u2019t excuse him from being an AH for the dog request.", "You said its not a risk you would be willing to take, but also said you have a child/children, and have a dog/dogs \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "I just don\u2019t understand why OP won\u2019t elaborate on their reasoning here. There are situations where the \u201cno dogs\u201d rule is not entirely unreasonable, but OP chose not to share any additional details.\n\nIf the babysitting were taking place at OP\u2019s house and OP did not want dogs there I\u2019d find this situation much more understandable (some people just don\u2019t like animals in their spaces), but it sounds like the babysitting will take place at the parents house. \n\nIf the fear was over a *specific* dog, I would also understand. For example, if the sister\u2019s dogs were known to be unruly and very aggressive towards children. However, OP even states they believe the sister\u2019s dogs are well-behaved, so that isn\u2019t a likely scenario either.\n\nIt really does sound like OP possibly doesn\u2019t want the child to grow up close to dogs\u2026.Perhaps so they\u2019ll never ask for one when they get older? Or does OP want them to grow up afraid of dogs so they\u2019ll always stay away from them? Or is this just a weird control thing OP has chosen to fixate on? The whole thing is just so odd.", "Typically, if someone asks for something, they have to comply with the boundaries. The other person is doing you a favor by allowing you that request. So if OP was asking his mom to watch the kid, he'd be TA and being very entitled. But since it's the other way around, NTA. It's totally fair for a parent to have boundaries when being asked if someone can watch their 4mo baby.", "In essence the dude doesn\u2019t want dogs in the house with the baby. That should be end of discussion.", "You are correct- I have pets and kids and I individually also think it\u2019ll be good for their immune systems. \n\nThat said, I think you\u2019re maybe getting lost in the details and missing the crux of my argument: \n\nIt\u2019s not about how you or I personally perceive the level of risk. It\u2019s about how this baby\u2019s parents perceive the risk. It\u2019s about what THEY are comfortable with. I think that should literally be the only thing that matters here.", "Reread the post.", "I have an 8 year old and I have 6 cats, I foster cats for rescue work, although I've grown up around dogs my entire life and she has 2 dogs now, ive never put it in place myself with my parent but i can see why people would want to , some rescue and could turn aggressive at the flick of a switch, one of my cats its going to maul a child to death like a dog can in the blink of an eye. Also I got cats and started fostering when he was older.", "And it should also be the end of any offer of free babysitting from his mother.", "The sister had her dogs there first, that's the crux of the argument for me. If you don't want your kid around dogs, go elsewhere for care.  These people choose not to be around sisters dogs because they seem to hate dogs.  They're annoying.  Uhm, okay.", "? It still says that the kids would be at grandma's house all day, not OPs house, therefore, not his place to tell her no dogs in her home.", "Grandparents made their choice to watch the baby instead of the pups though, and told sister her dogs will have to stay away when they watch the baby. Which they offered to babysit of their own volition. And agreed to do even after being presented the (perfectly reasonable) guidelines. \n\nForgive me for not being shocked that grandparents are going to choose their grandchildren over their granddogs."]}
