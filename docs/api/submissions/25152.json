She knows full well that problems she causes are also hers to fix.\n\nThe actual incident:\n\nShe stupidly went for an unprotected left turn and hit another car. My car was not badly damaged, while the other was totaled and the driver injured. \n\nAfter the impact, I immediately pulled out my license and insurance card, handed them to her, and told her to get out and deal with it. She hovered around while passersby were helping the other driver and repeatedly ran back to me to beg me to do it for her. I stuck to my guns.\n\nI did not completely throw her to the wolves, as my window was down and I could hear the entire conversation. My daughter handled it rather terribly, admitting fault immediately (but it was her fault to be fair). I was expecting the other driver to let her have it and to use that as a learning opportunity to not do that again, but the opposite happened. Literally, my daughter injured this woman, totaled her car, and scared the shit out of her dog in the backseat\u2026 and she tells her that it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just a car. That\u2019s why we have insurance. You\u2019re a kid. Are you kidding me??\n\nThen she holds her hand through the whole exchange of information and tells her what to do when she gets home, which I thought I went over but evidently not well enough.\n\nNeedless to say, my daughter will not be driving for a long time, until she understands how lucky she is to not be in jail for vehicular manslaughter right now.\n\nNow, I\u2019m posting because although my daughter is usually very responsible and understanding of consequences, she has spent most of the last week crying or shut in her room and has barely spoken to me. The few things she has said have been about how she needed me to help her and I didn\u2019t. I feel that I helped her by preparing her, and I would have stepped in if I had to, except she was being babied by the other driver.

The sort of person you are not.\n\nHonestly, if I were the other driver, I would have been disgusted at you. It would have required all my self-control not to march up to you and yell \"Your daughter needs you! Get out of your goddamn car and help her!\"\n\nYour daughter isn't talking to you? I don't blame her. You're cruel. If you were my parent, I'd have a very hard time forgiving you for this.\n\nDo your daughter a favor, and never get in a car with her again when she's driving.

I had a massive accident 2 weeks after I was first allowed to drive alone. The first thing I did, after checking on the other driver and getting out of traffic, was call my mum (I was driving her car). I *knew* the insurance details. I *knew* what to do after an accident. *But I'd just been in a car crash*. I was panicked, completely out of my depth. You know what my mum did? She reminded me of the insurance details, told me the number for the police line, reminded me that as long as the people were fine it would all be okay, and called her friend to pick her up and bring her to where I was.\n\nYou didn't teach your daughter how to handle a car crash. You taught her she couldn't rely on you in an emergency. You showed her that you would just sit there and watch, not supporting her at all. You could have gotten out and been silent support. You could have done almost anything except what you did.\n\nThank god for the saint of a woman that your daughter hit.", "YTA. She was going through an incredibly stressful, maybe even traumatic situation. You're her parent and it's your job to be there for her when she needs you.", "So, hold on - is she a licensed driver (or does she have a learners permit) or were you teaching her how to drive?\n\nBecause, my dude - if she's not a fully licensed driver this accident is entirely YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

If you care, hire a professional to teach your daughter instead of doing it yourself and traumatizing her.\n\nWhat lessons did she learn as a child years ago? Piano lessons? You likely hired a music teacher. Soccer? She likely joined a league and got coached properly. Karate? You took her to the dojo and she had a respectable sensei. Outsource if you couldn\u2019t teach her right. YTA", "YTA, get a therapist. Obviously you\u2019re more concerned with \u201csticking to your guns\u201d than taking care of YOUR child.

You\u2019re the adult and parent. Fucking act like it.", "YTA.\n\nShe is 15. She's a student driver. She's literally not personally responsible. She's a child who does not have her own license. You are responsible for her, as both her parent and the licensed driver in the car, so how about *you* take some personal responsibility here. She shouldn't have made an unprotected left, but, uh--did you say anything? Try to stop her? Even so, even adult drivers get in accidents and make mistakes. Getting in an accident can be terrifying for an adult, let alone a child, at fault or not. And you had no idea how the other driver would handle it, what they might have said or even done to her--it actually sounds like you're *angry* that the other driver was kind to her? \n\nShe is NOT an adult. She is not legally responsible for herself. She is not neurologically or emotionally equipped to be responsible for herself. She is a child, who is *learning* how to drive, made a mistake, and experienced something terrifying, and you just exacerbated that terror and yeah, absolutely did throw her to the wolves. It sounds like you were salivating for the other driver to scream at her, maybe so you wouldn't have to. How about you try actually parenting instead? The other driver, whose car she totaled, was able to have a kinder and more empathetic response upon seeing that she was a terrified kid than you did--even though that is *your child* whom *you* took responsibility for teaching to drive. \n\nI got in an accident when I was 17 and had just gotten my license. It was not my fault, but it was a collision with another teenage driver that probably wouldn't have happened if either of us had been more experienced. My car was totaled and spun 360 degrees. I didn't even full realize what had happened and was probably in shock, and saw a minivan pulled over with a kid in the car and the mom was out trying to help both me and the other driver call our parents and talk to the police, but at first I was so terrified that I'd hit her car, with a kid in it. Everybody was okay, it all turned out fine, but I was *terrified* to drive for several years, even though I did it anyway. I literally had flashbacks, and felt so guilty and ashamed even though the accident wasn't my fault. I was just a kid, and I was terrified. I could not have managed that interaction by myself. Because I wasn't supposed to be able to. Because I was a *minor child who wasn't legally responsible for myself.* Be there for your kid, jesus christ. All she learned from this is that she can't trust you to be there when she needs you, or to teach her, or to take responsibility, or to have her back in an emergency when she's scared and upset, and that strangers are kinder to her than you are.", "YTA. She's fifteen and you are teaching her to drive, which means you are responsible for everything she does on the road. You can't just put an untrained fifteen-year-old driver in a car, leave all the driving up to her, and then make her feel like a murderer when she inevitably makes a mistake. She made that left turn because you were not giving her adequate directions to keep her from getting in an accident, which means you are the one who caused that accident, not her. And I think you know it, which is why you are getting so over-the-top angry that the nice normal driver of the other car didn't validate your attempt to blame your daughter for your own negligence.", "The other driver was more empathetic than you were. And you were surprised by her empathy. YTA", "YTA. She\u2019s 15 and as the parent to a teenager, you\u2019re meant to help guide her in new, adult situations.

And you\u2019re mad at the other driver for showing compassion to your daughter instead of reaming her out? It IS just a car! I\u2019m sure the one adult in the whole situation could see that making your daughter feel worse than she already did wasn\u2019t going to be helpful. I also don\u2019t understand why you weren\u2019t yelling \u201cBRAKE! BRAKE!\u201d as your daughter was turning into the other car. You\u2019re supposed to be teaching her and telling her what to do in the car and when it\u2019s safe to turn.

You completely threw her to the wolves.  The appropriate response would have been to stand by her side and gently encourage her while you guided her on how to respond.  Book learning (telling her what she should do in case of an accident) is not the same as the actual experience of being in an accident.  You can\u2019t learn how to deal with the actual shock and panic dispassionately.  You blew a teaching moment\u2026one where you could have guided and advised her\u2026all because you have this notion that she should be able to handle it because you\u2019ve explained it all.  \n\nInstead, a total stranger demonstrated more compassion and empathy than her own parent did.

The poor girl is 15 and was scared despite you \"preparing\" her, and of course the other woman was kind.

Some people deal with stressful situations differently, if you could see she was about to shit herself you should have jumped in and taken  over the reigns.

You aren't preparing her on how to handle driving situations, but you have proven she cannot count on you. You failed as her father, and her driving instructor. Oh and news flash, the responsibility is ultimately yours. So, if she did have to face charges of vehicular manslaughter, you'd be right there next to her as you were the licensed driver next to her.

You could have at least gotten out of the car and guided her, \"remember what I taught you\". Your daughter \"got off so easy\" because the other driver could see how scared and distraught she was. A FUCKING STRANGER CARED MORE ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER THAN YOU DID. Big big big YTA.", "YTA. You sound, admittedly, a lot like my dad in a lot of situations. Car wrecks are scary (not a time for one of your weird tests) . Even my hot-headed father has never yelled or been an asshole over a wreck. There are much kinder ways to reinforce responsibility \u2014 standing by like a limp dick while your FIFTEEN year old daughter navigates a car wreck is not one of them.

It isn't fun at all to deal with, but at the same time you just straight up made her do everything on her own without any help whatsoever. You did throw her to the wolves, you're not getting any sympathy from me. The biggest factor here OP, is that she's 15 and still learning and yet you expect her to understand everything all at once with little to no flexibility. \n\nInstead of helping your daughter through this time OP, you would rather make a post on reddit thinking whether or not your inaction is what made you the AH in this situation.", "I can see your perspective on wanting to teach responsibility, but this is your vehicle and she still has a learner\u2019s permit. You are the licensed driver. You should have gotten out of the car. That being said, you are her mother and need to teach her how to process traumatic feelings. You\u2019re not doing that. You scared the shit out of her to the point that she was a nervous wreck and ended up causing an accident, and now you\u2019re scaring the shit out of her more by shaming her. Help her calm down, show some grace and compassion, and talk with her about what to do in the future.\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nI had a pretty serious (for the vehicles, people were fine) accident in high school, and the first thing I did was call my mom. She drove straight over and then accompanied me as I approached the driver to exchange information and apologize because it was my fault. I can still remember the horror and embarrassment I felt during the whole thing, especially because the guy I hit was a large, imposing man who wasn\u2019t very friendly. Parents are supposed to support their children when they make mistakes (and that\u2019s what it was, a MISTAKE) and that means getting out of the car to go with her. Does that mean you should\u2019ve done the talking and apologizing and taken over? No, but you should have at least been beside her and guiding her through the process. Even just being a silent presence next to her would have been light years better than what you did. \n\nAlso, what if the person your daughter hit was someone who wasn\u2019t as nice? What if they were pissed and carrying a weapon? Sure, you were in the car watching and listening, but all it takes is a split second for something awful to happen. Or what if they screamed and yelled, berated her, and called her names, scaring her or making her cry? (This is assuming you care about the emotional state of your daughter, but considering you were hoping the other driver would rip her a new one, I doubt it)\n\nFrankly, everything the other driver said is what you should\u2019ve been telling her. The shock and trauma of the accident is already enough to make her more cautious going forward, if she ever wants to get behind the wheel again, and all your behavior did was increase the amount of trauma your daughter endured and reinforced that you don\u2019t really care about her and can\u2019t be relied upon for any sort of support in unfamiliar or scary situations. \n\nShe\u2019s a brand new driver. You wouldn\u2019t expect a toddler who just learned to walk to put a bandaid on their skinned knee after falling. They probably know they need a bandaid, but they\u2019re in too much pain and/or too shocked to do it themselves. You don\u2019t start telling a kid to bandage their own knee until several years down the road, after you\u2019ve helped them multiple times and it\u2019s not as scary as it was initially.", "Brain development Isn\u2019t complete until around age 26. At 15, her brain is several stages away from being fully developed and it is in a particularly volatile state. You are asking too much of her. An accident is traumatic, and a traumatized brain has a hard time accessing information, especially when she is so young. She needed guidance getting through it, which the other driver provided. It should have been you that she was leaning on. Parenting is not all about the tough, pushing parts. It\u2019s also about cushioning impact so that learning can take place in manageable stages. You don\u2019t teach algebra without first teaching arithmetic. Fully handling an accident on her own at 15 is too much for such a young brain. Keep this up in addition to forbidding her to drive because of her mistake, and you are going to have a kid who is too anxious to drive. As for \u201cpersonal responsibility,\u201d you shirked yours. I\u2019ve taught my three kids to drive. How did you not see that she was making an error? That\u2019s your job! As the responsible adult, you absolutely should have been interacting with the other driver. Your daughter is not an adult, stop expecting her to act like one. You are an adult, act like it. You could learn a lot from that other driver. Things like empathy, compassion, emotional intelligence, and understanding about what is developmentally appropriate to expect from a teen.

So yes you did throw her to the wolves. \n\nYou expected the person to treat her like an adult but she\u2019s not an adult! Someone who sees a CHILD who is obviously really scared and treats them accordingly is a wonderful human being. Unlike you. YTA", "YOU ARE A COLOSSAL ASSHOLE!!!!! Clear enough for you? She is just a kid, and this scared her shitless. From the way you portray how she acted, you certainly did NOT prepare her well enough to handle this. It's also indicative of just how horrifically you failed as a parent that the crash victim was the person who actually helped her navigate this incident. She's isolating herself because she is devastated to realize she can't trust you as a parent. You destroyed her trust in you. You utterly betrayed her. You have destroyed something precious, and there may be no coming back from this. That child deserves way better than you for a father.", "YTA. Your literal job as a parent is to Guide and Teach your child. You can try and \"prepare\" her for anything and everything, but that doesn't mean a fuck thing. You can't prepare a child for that level of fear and stress. It was her very first accident and she needed a helping hand to Guide and Teach (your fucking job) her how to handle those feelings and do what needs to be done. A literal stranger who was injured with a totaled car had more compassion for your child who probably felt completely alone and terrified, because her parent couldn't be assed to get out of the fucking car and stand by your child for reassurance that she was doing the right things. The only thing you seemed to teach your child is that she can't rely on her parent when she needs them. No one babied her, that kind woman gave her the advice and guidance she needed in that moment because you failed her. There's a big difference between teaching a child accountability and just straight abandoning them emotionally and throwing them to the wolves. \"but I was there, I could hear everything from the car\" being in the physical vicinity doesn't equate  to being mentally or emotionally present. \"I would've stepped in if needed\" it was absolutely needed, and still you did nothing. Maybe instead of being disappointed with someone else because that lady stepped in where you failed as a parent, get some fucking therapy and be disappointed in yourself. I don't know who hindered your sense of compassion and care when you were young, but I'm sorry whoever it was failed you like you failed your own child.", "YTA!!!

Besides sitting in the car doing nothing, or completely taking over and running the show, you could have stood with your daughter, backing her up and giving her confidence, and prompting her with what the next step/s should be in her interaction with the other driver...etc. etc.  \nYou can't just throw a teenager to the wolves like that and \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af and say \"well I told her what to do\".

Did you say \u201cwait for that car to pass, you have an unprotected left turn\u201d? Of course not, because she has to learn by having the accident. Also, there\u2019s a HUGE difference between the theoretical knowledge from books and lectures, and the actual practical knowledge by doing. YOUR job was to get out of the vehicle with her and be there to remind her what she needs to do, not have her run back and forth from the vehicle trying to get help and then having the other person be the one to walk her through putting the theory into practice. Do you know why your daughter won\u2019t be driving for a long time, if ever? Because she is terrified since YOU have done absolutely nothing to reassure her and give her confidence to get back behind the wheel, not because you won\u2019t let her. Do you know why she has spent the last week crying or shut in her room barely speaking to you? Because you have done NOTHING to help her overcome her terror and trauma and she no longer has ANY confidence in your ability to teach her or care for her. She has learned that you don\u2019t care if SHE were injured, killed, or thrown into jail as those are all \u201cteaching moments\u201d. To top it off, you have undoubtedly prevented any other family member from comforting her because \u201cshe has to learn\u201d. Do you know what she has now learned?

But do you want to know what I could do? call my mum, who was able to come and help me deal with things, you have made it horribly clear to your daughter that she can not rely on you in any form of an emergency, sure you might not have intended that but it's what she now thinks and believes.   \ngood job fucking that up.", "YTA.\n\nIt's good that you're teaching your daughter already to be ready but do be prepared that your methods may teach unintentional things or cause unintentional harms.\n\nLet's be honest - regardless of age every accident(or car crash as you say) is pretty shitty for every driver and the first absolutely is always the worst - given the magnitude of costs etc involved. Few people teach you have to deal with it properly let alone do you remember that in a time of emotion.\n\nYou could have been softer in ways and shown your daughrer more support - even just standing ear(especially as she came to seek help and reassurance a few times). You may feel confident bexause you were 'watching' but did she even know? Did you ever express and reassure her it was fine and you would support her? Could she have read your, frankly quite cold, demeanour as being against her??\n\nIt's a bit of a shame tbh the other lady had to parent and support your daughter more than you - but that's also generally a good and better attitude to take.

Before she touched the wheel, I made sure she knew exactly what to do in case of an accident.\n\n3. I am big on personal responsibility with my daughter. She knows full well that problems she causes are also hers to fix.\n\nThe actual incident:\n\nShe stupidly went for an unprotected left turn and hit another car. My car was not badly damaged, while the other was totaled and the driver injured. \n\nAfter the impact, I immediately pulled out my license and insurance card, handed them to her, and told her to get out and deal with it.

Literally, my daughter injured this woman, totaled her car, and scared the shit out of her dog in the backseat\u2026 and she tells her that it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just a car.

The few things she has said have been about how she needed me to help her and I didn\u2019t. I feel that I helped her by preparing her, and I would have stepped in if I had to, except she was being babied by the other driver.

Both not my fault, someone swerved into me without looking at a speed of 130 km/h and the second time I was waiting at a red light and a semi rear ended me because he wasn't paying attention to the traffic lights.\n\nThe first one had me shaken a bit, the second one makes me very happy that they're working on the road there and removing that traffic light to make things safer because while the light was still there I avoided that road like the plague.  \n\n\nThankfully in both cases no one was screaming at me or being a massive Richard like OP was to his daughter.", "Psychopath", "That\u2019s when a responsible parent steps in and helps their kid to manage the situation.  The kid is learning how to drive and you act like you\u2019ve never made a mistake or bad decision in your life.", "Legally, those tasks were your responsibility.", "Yeah this situation might have proven to her how little her dad cares, and so she is likely dealing with the after math of the stress and anxiety from the accident, but also she is having to process that a literal stranger was kinder to her than her own dad. Her dad would have probably sent her to the hospital on her own too had she been hurt, but he clearly didnt bother to see if she was okay. She\u2019s not!", "Let's all hope so.

You really did. You wanted her hurt and scared and abused. You planned on using someone else to abuse her. You like seeing her frightened. You relish it. \n\nYou\u2019re going to hold this over her head every time she asks for anything. You\u2019re hoping she\u2019s so frightened she won\u2019t ever want to drive. If she ever ask for money, you\u2019ll deny her because you\u2019re still paying off the deductible and the insurance has gone up. \n\nThere are parents who love breaking their kids\u2019 will, keeping them scared and controlled. You are one of them. \n\nThis is so disturbing.", "Yes she could have killed someone while under YOUR supervision.  YOU failed her.  YOU are responsible for the minor child, not the other way around.", "Yeah, she could've, which is YOUR fault.

U do know u would be blamed in most cases not her, right?", "And you,  as the licenced driver, were responsible for making sure this didn't happen.

You can't compare an adult's reaction to that of a child, which is what your daughter is, particularly from a legal standpoint.\n\nBeing big on personal responsibility is great, but you're taking it to extreme in this case. Your daughter is a child, she is still learning. These are her formative years and I'm sure this experience wasn't just a case of a conflict between you two but of massive trauma for her. \n\nWhy do you use words like 'manslaughter' when nothing of the sort happened? If anything, your daughter should take driving lessons from a certified instructor, not yourself. \n\nTrust me on this one, parental guidance is extremely important especially at her age. You're a parent, your first duty is *to protect* and provide - not just personal responsibility 'lessons' but also support, coping skills, advice, anything where you may be able to help. \n\nYou didn't protect your daughter, you let her deal with a situation that usually unnerves pretty much the majority of adults. You paid attention to how scared the other drivers' *dog* was, what about your daughter? Wasn't *she* also scared? \n\nTaking responsibility is important, but you can teach your daughter how to do this without letting her be 100% on her own, especially at her age, especially in a circumstance like a traffic accident. Not ok at all, you seem to be *a huge AH*. \n\nDon't be surprised if your daughter stops trusting you, sharing anything with you or if your relationship sours completely.

Your daughter is a kid with a shitty parent to parent her. Luckily she can leave you behind at 18 yo, like I did with my parents!", "You seem to just want validation for your point. If your parents raised you similarly, it's understandable that you think your behavior was right. But pause for a moment, just a quick moment, take a deep breath and acknowledge that a lot of people are telling you, you should have handled it differently. That's a fact. \n\nJust take this information and let it sit for the next two days. Start asking yourself questions: Did I get empathy as a child? If I didn't, did I think I didn't deserve better because my behavior was wrong? What has that taught me about myself and how do I apply those same beliefs on my daughter? \n\nWhat you are experiencing is intergenerational trauma that's so internalized that you can't even see it as that anymore. You have an opportunity to break the cycle for your daughter.

Also, in that case YOU would\u2019ve been responsible, actually in every case YOU are liable not the unlicensed 15 year old driver you were \u201cteaching\u201d.

Say all that you\u2019ve said in front of a Judge, see how well it works out for you.", "Yes but that would still have been YOUR responsibility since YOU put a 15 year old untrained driver behind the wheel.

After I got more confident and had better situational awareness, he relaxed a bit more, but was still paying close attention.\n\nThis dude failed his kid in every way as both a driving instructor AND a parent.
