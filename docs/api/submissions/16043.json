Likely Jaime feels you said no due to you not liking Courtney, so is understandably hurt at such an a.h. move.", "NTA. Go over the why with him. But don 't be surprised if you lose contact anyway. You hurt him by not going. You make her mad by going. Either way you lose. Have you thought about adding her to the sessions?", "I would not attend. There is no way I would attend an event that would upset the people who should be happy at the event. \n\nBut i would screenshot whatever hints to suggest that my presence would not be welcomed. So that I explain to my brother that my intention for not attending is not ill natured. \n\nAnd depending on how much i care for my brother, i would assure him that I rather she be happy and would be ok with not attending.", "NTA. Go to the proposal; this kind of event and being a part of it is important in building or repairing a relationship. Be unobtrusive, as the day is about someone else. If anyone kicks off with you for no reason, well, can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t warn your brother about this being a worry. Don\u2019t respond. Walk away. Keep the focus off you. And perhaps only discuss it in counselling, if something really does happen.", "NTA - just a tough situation. Either decision that you make will have consequences you are actively trying to avoid.", "NTA, Courtney is the asshole.\nJamie should decide on who to invite from his side of the family. how does she dare impose on him to not invite his own sister. that\u2019s toxic AF on her side. She needs to get over the arguments you guys had when you were teens, as clearly you and your brother have been working on that like adults. \n\na possible solution: talk with Jaimie. maybe don\u2019t go to the proposal, but make sure to heal the relationship between all three of you prior to the wedding. or even better, first talk things out all three and have him wait with the proposal for a bit. \n\nyou should definitely be invited to the wedding. \nif she does not want you at the wedding, Jaimie should reconsider his proposal.", "NTA but you do need to make sure you explain why you're not going. Explain to him that you want to support him, of course you do, but you feel like you're between a rock and hard place, that if you don't go you'll upset him and if you do go you'll upset Courtney, and you just don't want to spoil their special moment. He may not listen, but at least you'll know that you've tried your best.", "NTA It seems weirdly narcissistic to invite people to watch something as deeply personal as a proposal.", "You're NTA, explain to your brother that you would like to be there to support him but you are afraid your presence would upset Courtney and potentially ruin the proposal. I f you explain it to him and he still wants you there then go and support him and if Courtney behaves poorly then that's on her and Jamie can tell her he wanted you there.", "Welcome to the Kobayashi Maru, the no win scenario. \n\nDo you a) go to the party, risk enraging the soon to be fiance and potentially go no contact with your brother?\n\nOr do you b) not go to the party, fail to give your brother love and support during a critical moment in his life, and potentially go no contact with your brother?\n\nNTA pick the best option you can live with.", "I'd say ESH \n\nYou're trying to mend a relationship and refusing to attend something so important to him is obviously going to upset him\n\nBut your reason is very valid and understandable so if your brother isn't being understanding of that he's an AH too\n\nWhat I suggest is you attend, keeping interactions with his gf to the minimum and no far from formal and then leave shortly after, don't stay there for too long to avoid possible problems", "YTA I am likely to be in the minority but here are my reasons for voting the way I did. Courtney, as his future wife, is supposed to be on Jaimes' side, that is a good thing. Mending your relationship with your brother will take work and that means sometimes doing things that may be uncomfortable. Your brother likely wants his whole family there and is hoping you will try to get along with Courtney, see reason 1 why you should try.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
