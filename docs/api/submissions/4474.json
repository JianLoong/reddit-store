We've been together since my senior (and his junior) year of hs and have been engaged for about 6 months. We've just started the process of wedding planning and so far don't have an exact date yet and no one has been invited. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9's brother (22M) is to put it simply a bad person. We've never gotten along. I've always been close with his other family members, but his brother has been mean to me since day one of us dating and is literally a criminal. \n\nHe was in and out of juvy throughout highschool, mostly for shoplifting. He currently is unemployed and taking complete advantage of his gf while he does illegal substances and she works 2 jobs. \n\nMy brother and him are the same age and were in the same class, and they absolutely hate each other. He was my brother's bully in hs, and my brother came home on multiple occasions literally crying because my fianc\u00e9's brother was making fun of him or trying to peer pressure him into illegal activity. \n\nDuring this time my fianc\u00e9 always was on my side and would talk to his brother and try to stop it. He's never been close with him and never defended his behavior. \n\nWhich is why when I told him I don't want his brother at the wedding I was surprised he had any issue. A few nights ago we were making a guest list of everyone we think we want to invite, and we were riding down all the names of his family members. I told him \"well everyone besides (brothers name) can come because obviously we don't need him there.\"  \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 got super upset. He told me that's he's family and it would be wrong not to invite him. He said it's his wedding too and I don't get to decide weather or not his own brother can come. \n\nI told him I'm not under any circumstances having someone like that at my wedding, especially since my brother will be there and it'll probably cause a fight. I told him it's a \"No. Period.\" and I'm not even considering inviting him. \n\nHe said I'm being controlling and I'm acting like it's only my wedding when it's also his too. \n\nBut, am I really? I just don't want toxic people there. I don't want fights between our brothers. And like I said my fianc\u00e9 and him aren't even close, it's not like I'm taking away his best friend. They haven't even spoken in a year. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has been mad at me for days now over it and neither of us are budging. And now idk what to do. I'm worried if I don't let him come it'll ruin the whole day for my fianc\u00e9 and if he does come it'll ruin the whole day for me and my brother. \n\nAITA for telling him his brother isn't allowed to come?", "created_utc": 1670741174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ziin4k/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_his_brother_cant_come/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

None of you have been in high school for almost 10 years, and that is the reason you want to exclude him?

Based on your future husband's reaction, not inviting him is not an option you have, so YTA, if you continue to push excluding his family from his wedding.", "NAH- it sucks because you have some really valid reasons for not wanting him there but he is right that it's his brother.\nA good compromise would be inviting him to the ceremony bur he can't come to the reception. \nBecause the reception is where he can access alcohol and freely talk (cause problems). Also I wouldn't trust anyone with substance abuse problems to be around high value items. Even non addicted people will steal wedding gifts and cash out of envelopes.  I saw this a lot in the first few weddings I attended and I personally do not bring gifts to weddings ever because of this and send it directly to the couples home and make sure they received all the items. I've had companies not send all the items in the order ans assume the sender never finds out because they didn't receive it.", "N T A for not wanting him there but slight A H for the way you said it \"obviously don't need\". You should said \"I know he's your brother but you're not close and I don't want him there because of his bullying of my brother and his thievery and substance use\". Ask your fiancee if he's going to watch your brother like a hawk the entire time of the reception to make sure he doesn't swipe anything from a guests belongings while they may be on the dance floor. If anyone else knows the brothers history and see him there, any one of them can claim to have had something stolen and whether or not the brother did it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f he'll still catch the blame for it and people will be crying to you. Certainly you don't want him to be wasted at your wedding.", "Invite both people but you tell them both, any trouble they both get kicked out whoever starts it", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So you have in effect canceled the wedding.**", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 You need to find out why future hubby is so insistent on having someone who's abusive to both you and your brother at the wedding.  Why is he OK with inviting someone who is beyond disrespectful to you?  The person he claims to want to spend his life with? Why does he think it's OK to invite someone like that to share in your wedding? It doesn't matter that it's his brother, he's abusive\n\nperiod. \n\nFull stop.\n\nEnd of story.\n\nNTA", "YTA for not discussing it proper and going period. You are acting like it\u2019s only your wedding. If you want that then marry yourself", "Mild YTA because you made a decision without consulting your partner. You need to discuss these things together and reach a consensus. there is a huge difference between \u201cof course your brother can\u2019t come\u201d and \u201cwhat are we going to do about your brother, should we not invite him?\u201d.", "Lol that might honestly happen at this point", "On the one hand I agree, on the other hand the fiance just whipped out the \"well they're abusive but they're family so must be tolerated\" card which is, at best, deeply worrying.", "The compromise can be that the brother can attend, but he must remain in a shark cage during the entire event. Done and done.\n\nProblem solving right here, folks.", "So what would you do if your partner wanted to invite their brother who brutally bullied your brother to the point of tears, is a convicted criminal who continues to practice dangerous criminal activity, and financially abuses his own partner? I'm asking in complete sincerity: what compromise would you use?\n\nNTA, OP. Fiance has proven FAMILY! overrrides everything, no matter how much he dislikes his brother. Take it as a prediction of what will come. \"I need to dip into our savings to bail my brother out of jail and get him an attorney -- family. My brother's been evicted, and I have to let him stay with us -- family. I know he stole from us, but we can't press charges -- family. Of course my brother will be allowed to hold our baby and babysit our kid alone -- FAMILY!\"", "Plus discuss it with your brother who've been bullied to see how he feels about it ? That might make one of you change is view.", "Yep, a wedding's guest list isn't just to tally all the family- it's to have dear ones close to celebrate the union and uplift the couple in what some may see as joining families. DF knows his brother has been problematic to his own family, let alone his future spouse and in-laws - it's probably very hard to admit, but I wonder what he'd say he truly thinks his brother would come to the wedding for, and if he thinks his brother truly wants and offers the best for them and for him in his marriage and healthy life.", "His Mom loves me and she was always the one trying to get his brother to stop and comforting my brother when stuff happened between them. I assume she'd understand and support me. His Dad and sister would probably feel the same as my fianc\u00e9 does.", "Okay but seeing him once a year at thanksgiving is different than your own wedding. I wouldn\u2019t want to invite a toxic shitty person that didn\u2019t like me and bullied my brother at my wedding either.", "The fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t the bully, his brother was.", "Yeah that's fair, I might have been a little harsh", "Thanks for the advice", "Thanks, this kind of sums up my thoughts", "Tell the victim of bullying to not cause any problems with the bully?", ">or just tell your brother not to cause any problems and ignore your fiance's brother.\n\n1. Wow. The guy getting bullied should not cause any trouble?? \n\n2. The brother doesn't just bully OP's brother. He is also openly mean to OP and hates her. If he hates OP so much, he shouldn't get to go to her wedding.", "My brother never caused any tension with anyone that's a whole different thing. Also my brother is close to both of us, his brother hasn't even spoke with him in a year and hates me.", ">You have not said that he had done anything specifically to you.\n\nYes she did.", "Maybe- but his brother is still basically 16 mentally. He's the type of person to make a \"joke\" which is really a targeted insult just to stir things up and get a reaction.", "No - they aren't close. They don't even talk on the phone. They'll occasionally text each other like maybe every couple months but that's it. They weren't even close as teenagers.", "I'm only worried about that because my fianc\u00e9's brother would start that fight. My brother wouldn't be the one starting anything, that's not fair.", "Seriously? OP should uninvite her brother but invite her fiances brother who is mean to her and hates her?", "Of course! OP should totally not invite her brother who was a victim but instead invites the criminal bully who hates her to her wedding. /s\n\nYeah fuck that. OP should elope or cancel the wedding.", "So as usual the bully wins.", "Thus punishing her brother, because his brother will start shit.", "Even if you decide to elope. You and your fiance need to have a serious conversation about both of your brothers. Will he expect his brother at all big events even if he doesn't get clean? Is his family putting pressure on him? How will you guys deal with your brother being around his brother? What if you have kids?\n\nNeither you or your fiance are the AH but this is more than a wedding guest list problem", "So you can\u2019t tolerate him at your wedding, but you think if you just skip the wedding you\u2019ll be able to tolerate him\u2026forever? I\u2019m no Einstein but that\u2019s not adding up to me.", "Prob for the best- that\u2019s a tough sitch", "No without a signed, notarized contract stating Fiance will never give his brother money or invite him to stay with you or let him be around your kids and will definitely press charges if he steals from you.", "This. \"We must tolerate and forgive bad behavior because family\" is actually a huge red flag.", "I absolutely love the mental picture your comment painted in my mind.", "I like the way you think, however, a shark cage has large slats through which future-nightmare-BIL (FNBIL) could still wreak havoc (yelling, throwing things, drug use, etc). Perhaps a restraint setup like Hannibal from Silence of the Lambs is in order.", "But the brother doesn't just bully OP's brother. He is also openly mean to OP. \n\nI wouldn't want someone at my wedding who is mean to me and my family.", "This person said \u201cthe brother of your brothers bully\u201d so they get that already", "To reiterate what another poster said, you realize this won't end with the wedding, right?  Every special event, every holiday, will be the same argument.  UNLESS you two get on the same page right now.", "Any chance your fianc\u00e9 is pushing back because he feels you were being too dictatorial about it? Basically, does he actually want his brother there or is his problem with you acting like you can decide about his family?\n\nIt\u2019s a problem either way that you need to explore and resolve, but they\u2019re different problems.", "I\u2019m wondering if anyone has considered the part of the ceremony where they ask if there are any objections to this wedding? What\u2019s to stop the bullying brother who is mean to OP from standing up and objecting and turning it into a massive drama scene where he can sit back and laugh while enjoying the shit show he caused?", "There are several good reasons not to invite BIL, but only one will persuade your fianc\u00e9: the fact that BIL hates you.  Tell fianc\u00e9 that you don\u2019t want someone who hates you to attend your wedding.", "Someone who hates you should not be at your wedding. That would be enough right there for me to say NTA.", "Well then you need to talk with your husband. Don't just tell him no. If he wants to invite his brother and you are uncomfortable with that, come up with something that you both are ok with. You shouldn't invite someone who hates u to your wedding but that person is also a family member, so talk it out.", "Makes me wonder why he wants him there. Is he planning a surprise ritual sacrifice on behalf of you and your brother to appease the marriage gods?", "Then I don't understand his position. please consider my above talking points above.  Tell him that inviting his brother would ruin his relationship with your brother/his soon to be BIL. Ask him which relationship he values more and pick one.", "I was just making a point, it hurts to think of not having your brother at the wedding. Your fianc\u00e9 feels the same way about his brother. You are going to be married to this man which means you are going to have to see his brother. Are you going to tell his parents you will never go to there home for holidays or birthdays? Are you going to force your husband to distance himself from his family? What if the jerk has kids? Does your husband not get to see his nieces and nephews? Until your husband decides to go NC with his brother himself you are just going to have to deal with it. Dictating to other people their relationships is not okay.\n\nAlso plenty of jerks have behaved at weddings. Your fianc\u00e9 is just going to have to talk with his brother and maybe assign someone to keep an eye on him like a cousin friend or even his father.", "I'd upvote this more if I could.", "It\u2019s unfortunate that this hasn\u2019t come up before but I agree they need to have this talk now. Also OP stop \u201ctelling\u201d your fianc\u00e9 stuff. You aren\u2019t his mom and that\u2019s not the way to effectively communicate. I understand your passion on the subject but it will serve you well to have future conversations where you state your concern and allow space for fianc\u00e9 to respond as well.", "Lets take her brother out of the equation here, \n\nWhy does her fianc\u00e9 want to invite someone to their wedding that is literally mean to her all the time?\n\nWhy would he put her in a position to be uncomfortable or possibly have something said or happen to her by his brother at their wedding.\n\nHe knows that his brother is mean to her, but by wanting him invited to their wedding he is showing her that it is ok for his brother to treat her however he wants and he will choose his brother over her every time, because he is family.\n\nThat is a red flag if you ask me.", "yeah\u2026. I can see OP thinking that since her fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t close to his brother, maybe they can avoid this conflict by avoiding the event that fianc\u00e9 feels the brother should be invited to. However, weddings are good barometers for relationships. Avoiding the problem just kicks it down the road. If they have kids will her partner insist that his brother be allowed to bond with them as an uncle? What about any future family-oriented gatherings they might host?", ">If Fianc\u00e9 has been No Contact with his brother for a year(and presumably low contact for before that) I can see why OP wouldn't have had a discussion about it.  But yes, they need to have one now that it is an issue.", "I pictures guards around a cage with harpoons lol.", "I second this. The way you worded it was very assuming and absolute. Telling people what to do with their own family (even when it affects you) even when they agree often ends poorly. I bet this conversation would have gone very differently if you would have brought up your concerns about his brother and asked him what to do.", "What's to stop him banging on the glass window overlooking the wedding venue shouting \"Elaine!\" over and over, before using a giant crucifix to bolt the front doors closed and make his getaway? The mind boggles.", "Hey! How did you know my middle name! LOL the mental image you just gave me almost made me spit out my coffee!"]}
