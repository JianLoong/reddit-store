I truly love Hailey and her wife and view them as dear friends. The issue, however, involves the amount of money I spend on my daughter Anna. \nI am fairly well-off thanks to working for years on my business, and I like to buy my daughter the best of the best.

I also make sure to buy equally expensive gifts for all three girls when it comes to special occasions as a good family friend should. However, my daughter has a much bigger allowance than her step sisters and that obviously shows in the stuff she buys for herself. So far, I had not heard any complaints from anyone. \n\nThat is until Hailey came over the other day to talk, and asked me if I can tone down Anna\u2019s allowance a bit.

However, I think that applies more to situations where one side of the family is starving and the other is fed with a silver spoon, not discrepancies in the amount of Taylor Swift merch owned, especially since Anna always shares. She also is not allowed to spend her money on traditionally family experiences (like Disneyland or trips) without offering it to the girls too.And frankly, I worked hard for my money and shouldn\u2019t be obligated to consider the impact on another family\u2019s dynamic before spending it. And there is no evidence that their relationship is suffering as a result of money. \nBut on the other hand, I\u2019m worried about what if Janes sister is right, and if this could be planting seeds of resentment.

I realised it was bad for me and got him to stop but it was too late. My daughter had extra money from her dad while she was at university but saved it all up so she had a nest egg ... so not all kids are the same.

Hailey and her wife should give each of the 3 girls an equal share of what they can afford as an allowance (or very similar, since Anna is 17 I'd assume she'd get a bit extra than her younger sister who's 10). OP, on the other hand, only has 1 daughter, so you can afford to allocate 100% of your allowance budget to 1 kid, instead of splitting it in 3 as Hailey and Lisa must do. For this reason, Anna's sisters shouldn't resent her in any way. \n\nTo clarify, OP, you're entitled to give your daughter whatever you want if you can afford it. You're not T A for having money.

Our daughter grew up wanting for nothing, really. We taught her the value of things and she never asks for anything. Right now she\u2019s fixing up an ancient grandma car we got for $500 to be her first car. We did the right things and didn\u2019t give her every material thing, but we simply live a privileged existence. \n\nBut kids need grit. They need to not have all nice things at times, to show them how to sacrifice, have patience, and to not have so much of a safety cushion. By no means do I mean deprive her of love, support, and affection. I just mean\u2026. not always having the nicest material things in every situation, and instantly. Though she is appreciative, she will also have some sort of intrinsic expectation. I have the sweetest non bratty, sharing kid.

Probably because you guys have done a good job at ensuring the family got \"blended\" and ensuring they all see each other as sisters. It's not your responsibility to make sure their family dynamics stay balanced, but it sounds like there's not even any resentment to worry about in the first place.

It's good for the adults to be aware and discussing this.\n\nAs Anna is 17 now, you should include her in the adult category for this! She's shown she's responsible and generous, and will have to manage her own money soon. Leaving home she will meet a wider variety of people from different income levels and it's good for her to learn NOW about how to navigate those differences. What if she's the richer party in a romantic relationship? What if she's much poorer and comes to depend on a partner so much she doesn't feel she can leave? When eating out with a group of friends how do they pay? What are signs that a friend may feel too awkward to say that Anna or their group of friends are choosing expensive activities they can't afford? (And what if they don't want others to pay for them all the time?) \n\nIt's possible that step-mom is picking up on things OP is not. Anna may not appreciate how hard money can be to come by, so gives it away too easily. She may be a blatant anomaly in the community, dressing or acting in ways that draw attention... and it could be her step-sisters getting asked why she gets to have designer bags and drive a fancy car. The younger girls will have their own feelings about the wealth disparity, and may feel pressure to set themselves apart from Anna, or to glom onto her lifestyle. They could be pressured by friends to get favors from Anna, like wanting her to cover their next concert tickets, or swiping one of the bags she no longer uses. Step-mom might be getting weird vibes from her daughters, feeling like she's being compared to OP and found lacking. Or maybe it's not about the money at all, but that OP is spoiling Anna, not sticking to agreed rules, or not disciplining her when she deserves it. (Ask yourself in all seriousness, OP: on some level are you buying your daughter's affection?) \n\nI think there's a clear win for everyone if Anna takes this discussion as an opportunity to save up for the future. Whatever her plans after after high school she'll be better-prepared for it if she has savings. What kind of lifestyle does she want and expect in the next 5,10,and 25 years? Who's going to pay for it? Does she have a big dream she wants to chase? Does SHE want to cut back on how much she's spending? Would she prefer that some of her allowance go straight into a savings account? \n\nHonestly, OP, if you've been giving her so much for so long there are SOLID odds that her room(s) are full to the brim with items she appreciated but has moved on from. Ask her what she wants to take with her to a (tiny) dorm or (tiny) first apartment, and what she expects will happen to the things she leaves behind. Are you always going up store it for her? (Would they be safe from little sisters and friends?) Or would she prefer to start weeding now, and donate or sell things that can go to people who really want them? This is NOT about trying to kick her out, it's about empowering her to take agency over her own direction. Now is the time to talk about what she wants her life to look like and how much financial help she wants or expects. \n\nIt's awesome to be able to give her things, but it's going to feel EVEN BETTER when your daughter uses the solid foundation you've provided to go further and become her own person. At this stage, pay for stuff that will give her tools and opportunities (school, experiences, supplies for hobbies, sports, books, and niche interests), not just stuff she wants or that you think she wants. \n\nBy the sound of it, she'll always have a soft place to land between yo, and her mom & step-mom. If things go awry you'll be there for her. You don't have to kit her out with the best of everything for her to turn out okay. And at 17, you won't be able to shield her from everything coming her way. It's GOOD for her to leave the nest, take risks, and have to work for things. \n\nAnd if you just HAVE to spoil her... Put that money aside for the big shit: college (for Anna AND any grandkids), moving across country/world, homeownership, rainy day funds (disaster, divorce), everyday stuff (a good financial planner, healthcare), retirement annuities, funeral expenses (yours), all the things that could catch her short or make her life easier.", "NTA\n\nYou should not reduce your daughter's allowance just because someone else is jealous.

I know this is going beyond what was asked, but I went to college where the vast majority of students had financially successful parents, many of whom lavished their kids in that lifestyle. I can recall one in particular whose parents paid for her and 10 of her friends to fly to Vegas for her 21st birthday and stay in some ritzy hotel with entertainment likewise paid for by her parents. \n\nSome used their comfortable backgrounds to set themselves in careers to maintain that kind of lifestyle. Some chose a more modest profession and were happy to live a less affluent life. But there was another category where they just couldn't cut it and either became a bit bitter at no longer being able to afford all those luxuries or put themselves in serious debt trying to sustain it. It sounds like hopefully your daughter falls into one of those first 2 categories particularly with her desire to share the benefits with her half sisters, but I do think at 17 it will help to have a conversation about managing finances and that life can be happy even without those luxuries and perhaps begin tightening the purse strings to encourage her to find her financial independence.", "NTA, I understand their concerns but it sounds like your daughter is very fair and generous and even so are you and those concerns are not occurring.", "NTA.
