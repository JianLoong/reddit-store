I realised it was bad for me and got him to stop but it was too late. My daughter had extra money from her dad while she was at university but saved it all up so she had a nest egg ... so not all kids are the same.

Hailey and her wife should give each of the 3 girls an equal share of what they can afford as an allowance (or very similar, since Anna is 17 I'd assume she'd get a bit extra than her younger sister who's 10). OP, on the other hand, only has 1 daughter, so you can afford to allocate 100% of your allowance budget to 1 kid, instead of splitting it in 3 as Hailey and Lisa must do. For this reason, Anna's sisters shouldn't resent her in any way. \n\nTo clarify, OP, you're entitled to give your daughter whatever you want if you can afford it. You're not T A for having money.

Our daughter grew up wanting for nothing, really. We taught her the value of things and she never asks for anything. Right now she\u2019s fixing up an ancient grandma car we got for $500 to be her first car. We did the right things and didn\u2019t give her every material thing, but we simply live a privileged existence. \n\nBut kids need grit. They need to not have all nice things at times, to show them how to sacrifice, have patience, and to not have so much of a safety cushion. By no means do I mean deprive her of love, support, and affection. I just mean\u2026. not always having the nicest material things in every situation, and instantly. Though she is appreciative, she will also have some sort of intrinsic expectation. I have the sweetest non bratty, sharing kid.

Probably because you guys have done a good job at ensuring the family got \"blended\" and ensuring they all see each other as sisters. It's not your responsibility to make sure their family dynamics stay balanced, but it sounds like there's not even any resentment to worry about in the first place.

It's good for the adults to be aware and discussing this.\n\nAs Anna is 17 now, you should include her in the adult category for this! She's shown she's responsible and generous, and will have to manage her own money soon. Leaving home she will meet a wider variety of people from different income levels and it's good for her to learn NOW about how to navigate those differences. What if she's the richer party in a romantic relationship? What if she's much poorer and comes to depend on a partner so much she doesn't feel she can leave? When eating out with a group of friends how do they pay? What are signs that a friend may feel too awkward to say that Anna or their group of friends are choosing expensive activities they can't afford? (And what if they don't want others to pay for them all the time?) \n\nIt's possible that step-mom is picking up on things OP is not. Anna may not appreciate how hard money can be to come by, so gives it away too easily. She may be a blatant anomaly in the community, dressing or acting in ways that draw attention... and it could be her step-sisters getting asked why she gets to have designer bags and drive a fancy car. The younger girls will have their own feelings about the wealth disparity, and may feel pressure to set themselves apart from Anna, or to glom onto her lifestyle. They could be pressured by friends to get favors from Anna, like wanting her to cover their next concert tickets, or swiping one of the bags she no longer uses. Step-mom might be getting weird vibes from her daughters, feeling like she's being compared to OP and found lacking. Or maybe it's not about the money at all, but that OP is spoiling Anna, not sticking to agreed rules, or not disciplining her when she deserves it. (Ask yourself in all seriousness, OP: on some level are you buying your daughter's affection?) \n\nI think there's a clear win for everyone if Anna takes this discussion as an opportunity to save up for the future. Whatever her plans after after high school she'll be better-prepared for it if she has savings. What kind of lifestyle does she want and expect in the next 5,10,and 25 years? Who's going to pay for it? Does she have a big dream she wants to chase? Does SHE want to cut back on how much she's spending? Would she prefer that some of her allowance go straight into a savings account? \n\nHonestly, OP, if you've been giving her so much for so long there are SOLID odds that her room(s) are full to the brim with items she appreciated but has moved on from. Ask her what she wants to take with her to a (tiny) dorm or (tiny) first apartment, and what she expects will happen to the things she leaves behind. Are you always going up store it for her? (Would they be safe from little sisters and friends?) Or would she prefer to start weeding now, and donate or sell things that can go to people who really want them? This is NOT about trying to kick her out, it's about empowering her to take agency over her own direction. Now is the time to talk about what she wants her life to look like and how much financial help she wants or expects. \n\nIt's awesome to be able to give her things, but it's going to feel EVEN BETTER when your daughter uses the solid foundation you've provided to go further and become her own person. At this stage, pay for stuff that will give her tools and opportunities (school, experiences, supplies for hobbies, sports, books, and niche interests), not just stuff she wants or that you think she wants. \n\nBy the sound of it, she'll always have a soft place to land between yo, and her mom & step-mom. If things go awry you'll be there for her. You don't have to kit her out with the best of everything for her to turn out okay. And at 17, you won't be able to shield her from everything coming her way. It's GOOD for her to leave the nest, take risks, and have to work for things. \n\nAnd if you just HAVE to spoil her... Put that money aside for the big shit: college (for Anna AND any grandkids), moving across country/world, homeownership, rainy day funds (disaster, divorce), everyday stuff (a good financial planner, healthcare), retirement annuities, funeral expenses (yours), all the things that could catch her short or make her life easier.", "NTA\n\nYou should not reduce your daughter's allowance just because someone else is jealous.

I know this is going beyond what was asked, but I went to college where the vast majority of students had financially successful parents, many of whom lavished their kids in that lifestyle. I can recall one in particular whose parents paid for her and 10 of her friends to fly to Vegas for her 21st birthday and stay in some ritzy hotel with entertainment likewise paid for by her parents. \n\nSome used their comfortable backgrounds to set themselves in careers to maintain that kind of lifestyle. Some chose a more modest profession and were happy to live a less affluent life. But there was another category where they just couldn't cut it and either became a bit bitter at no longer being able to afford all those luxuries or put themselves in serious debt trying to sustain it. It sounds like hopefully your daughter falls into one of those first 2 categories particularly with her desire to share the benefits with her half sisters, but I do think at 17 it will help to have a conversation about managing finances and that life can be happy even without those luxuries and perhaps begin tightening the purse strings to encourage her to find her financial independence.", "NTA, I understand their concerns but it sounds like your daughter is very fair and generous and even so are you and those concerns are not occurring.", "NTA.

That\u2019s how women end up with rich guys who abuse them, and it\u2019s also how those abusers end up being the creeps they are.\n\nThis is the trap of working hard and making money as a parent: you get your kid used to a certain lifestyle and they feel inadequate if they can\u2019t maintain it on their own for whatever reason, even if only temporarily, and they let people who can help them maintain it manipulate and exploit them and sacrifice autonomy or self respect for it.\n\nIs your daughter responsible? Does she have a balance of good work ethic, enjoyment of life, and humility?  Then there really isn\u2019t a problem.

Maybe if you sit down and have a convo with her and just explain it to her.  I don\u2019t mean to tell you how to raise your kids but you are asking; so maybe this is just one of those moments where you need to sit down and teach her about how jealousy can ruin friendships, relationships, and families without demonizing the jealous person, and that sometimes we have to ask ourselves: what\u2019s more important: Material possessions or the people we love?\n\nI promise you; this is an opportunity to be a better person, and to teach your daughter to be a better person.  It\u2019s also a HUGE opportunity to be a good model of an emotionally available man that loves her, and wants the best for her so that she finds a a good partner in her life if she\u2019s into guys.\n\nWe also need to learn to receive the resentment and jealousy with empathy, compassion and grace, and this is another great reason to have this discussion with her.\n\nYes, you want to spoil your daughter, just like you wanted to spoil your wife when you were together.

He doesn\u2019t need to be the fun uncle, but it does sound like he does for them equally on occasions.", "Sure but maybe Anna feels resentment that she doesn\u2019t get both her parents and the other kids do? I mean there\u2019s no way to equalize this situation and it\u2019s not OPs responsibility to provide for the other kids.", "It sounds like he already is. Plus if daughter is already 17 it's a bit late, I'm guessing she'll be off to college in less than a year and the point will be moot, unless they get jealous because she can afford a better college or something, but... that's life. The only real problem I see is Mom and her unreasonable request.", "I suspect OP is simply unclear on terminology. But since people are repeating it.... If all 3 girls share a parent (i.e. OP's ex) Anna is a half-sister to the younger girls. It doesn't matter if that parent is biological or adopted. If, on the other hand, the girls do not share a parent, they would be step-sisters. For example, if the younger two came into the marriage with Jane, and OP's ex is a step-mother who has not adopted Jane's daughters, they are Anna's step-sisters.\nSince this post is all about differential treatment, it helps to identify the different relationships, since legal, as well as emotional possibilities are involved. Step-siblings usually come into a familial relationship later in life. If a marriage fails, it may completely end any relationship between step-siblings. Not so with half-siblings. They would or will be part of Anna's life forever.\nBTW Jane's sister should butt out. It's useless and potentially.counter-productive, to base parenting decisions on feelings a child might develop some years down the road. You all have enough on your plate without her adding things.", "That\u2019s not what I meant was normal. It\u2019s normal because the activities you have to pay for and adulthood is around the corner you need to save and so on. What I meant might be normal is an older sibling being generous to the younger ones and doing stuff with them with their money and so on. \nI too worked my ass of as a teen and paid for everything myself \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but wouldn\u2019t it have been nice to focus on schoolwork and having an allowance instead? OP has the means to give her an allowance like that, I know what I would prefer my kids had. Also no where does it say that Anna doesn\u2019t have a job too\u2026", "But that isn\u2019t OP\u2019s problem..", "But that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here, so what\u2019s the point of discussing that?", "Got it! Misunderstood your intention in that part. Completely agree.", "Because there's no evidence whatsoever that it's over jealousy. It could be, but you need more info to make that claim.", "She had no right to bring it up at all. I could see a concerned aunt trying to advocate for her other nibblings, but the fact remains that Anna has two parents and a stepmom, while her half-sibblings only have two parents. Her father shouldn't be punished for being successful and wanting to give his (only) daughter the best he can. Anna seems to have been raised well, not rubbing it in her siblings' faces, and sharing a lot of what she has with them. And OP is giving the siblings a lot more than they're entitled to from him (which is nothing, actually, since he has no obligation to them whatsoever). This obsession with levelling the playing field when it's not warranted is only going to drive a wedge between Anna and her siblings. And if the two moms keep pushing the matter, I could see OP withdrawing his generous support. And Anna may well decide to move in with him full time (she's 17, so a judge would listen to her opinion if it came to that) and go LC with the rest of the family. All because of a busybody who has no skin in the game.", "It's your money and you can spend it however you want,", "Exactly. We can only look at the situation as it is today. Maybe the two younger sisters parents will win the lottery and move to a magnificent mansion when the eldest has moved out \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f is the retroactively unfair to her? The children have different parents, should the eldest have less out of principle just because? One could argue that she would probably give up her extra pocket money if that meant she could\u2019ve grown up without her parents divorcing. Life isn\u2019t fair like that. It sounds like they have a great system going where OP is very generous and warm towards the younger siblings too. \nAlso why isn\u2019t the mother worried about her eldest being resentful over her allowance being cut because her 10 year old sister might be jealous possibly someday and find it unfair. What has the 17 year old done to deserve it? If she had been bragging and rubbing it in the younger ones faces and being a privileged brat, then yes by all means please cut her allowance. But her being generous, loving and sharing and actually responsible with her money? How is it fair to cut it in half when she is being kind with her privilege?", "It doesn't sound like an obsession from the post, it sounds like a level-headed conversation. I think you are adding a lot more vitriol to the conversation than what OP said in his post. I am not saying OP should change what he is doing, I am just saying Jane's sister and the ex are not assholes for having this conversation.", "I too think the age thing is important. If the step sisters were the same age and one had way more then I could see an issue but older children often get a bigger allowance anyeay as they are learning to budget school supplies, dates, clothes gas, phone plans lunch coffee etc and younger teens mostly only have money for treats etc.", "Also children at that age already have a concept of wealth and class. It may be limited, but they very much do. Which is why they tease and bully each other about not having trendy clothes or being unable to afford something, brag with rich relatives and stuff like that.", "They might not have formed any opinion on designer stuff, but younger sisters usually look up to the older. At least that's my experience with my friends growing up. As @JolyonFolkett said, older kids usually gets more, and the younger ones know Anna has another father who buys her stuff and she SHARES! Borrowing older sisters clothes was a big thing when we grew up, it was cool to use what the older had. Reducing Anna's allowance means she'll have less to share with the younger. I doubt they'll be happy with aunty Jane.", "Reddit likes to push every scenario to being the most nefarious, dramatic situation possible. Seriously, people think different, and both reasonable and unreasonable people can have poorly thought out ideas. \n\nAs long as everyone involved keeps a conversation calm, respectful & full of good intentions then what's the problem with having the conversation? \n\nTrue its not like they have a right to demand what the father does with HIS money, but if they have legitimate (from how they see it at least) concerns about how money *might* affect the dynamic of the sister's relationship, then it wouldn't be a good idea for OP to get all overly offended and accusatory like these comments are seeming to encourage. \n\nIf he truly does have a good relationship with his ex wife & her spouse, then it shouldn't be a problem to lovingly confront they about any jealousy the parents might be projecting on their kids (assuming that there IS any). \n\nHonestly, it could be as simple as the parents are secretly struggling financially and feel bad that they can't give their younger daughters the same thing as their sister, & worry about what that could do to the family dynamic. That can be solved with how they teach their kids to view money & the values they instill in them BEFORE any issue could come up. Teaching them to be greatful for what they have, that relationships are more valuable than material goods, to work hard for things they want, and gratitude for what they are given by others will keep resentment from taking root \n\nOP, just use your best judgment, refrain from being defensive or accusatory when the topic is brought up & things should be fine.", "It's a conversation that didn't need to be had.  At no point did OP mention that anyone seemed to have any problem with the situation or arrangement they had until AFTER Jane's sister decided to give her unsolicited opinions on what she observed.  It's not like she pulled Hailey aside and said \"Look, this is something that has been bothering Jane and she can't talk to you about it, so I thought I would\". Literally no one had any issues with this very successful blended family dynamic until Jane's sister did.", "I totally agree with this. Plus, there are going to be differences as this is not one family living under the same roof. You are Anna\u2019s father and are legally required to provide for her. The resentment would only come if your daughter flaunts what she has or puts down her sisters for what they don\u2019t have.  It is important to remember that kids need to learn life isn\u2019t fair, people will have different opportunities, experiences, etc. just due to the situation they were born into. How people treat each other despite these differences is what is important.", "Sometimes people have conversations that lead to nothing, but that's okay. Jane's sister had a concern, it might not be warranted, but it can be brought up in a polite manner."]}
