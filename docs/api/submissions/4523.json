In my opinion, you\u2019re NTA op. \n\n3 years is a massive, massive time period. For a few days? Absolutely. Maybe even a few weeks. But three YEARS? You guys should have come to a mutual agreement about that long before he left. A lot can change in three years. What happens if one of them passes in your care? What happens if you want to take a trip for yourself? A weekend getaway? Does the responsibility to find pet care then fall on you?", "Info: can you and the cats go with him ?", "I'm sitting here thinking \"they are cats!

There is a huge difference in entering an agreement with totally different circumstances. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think this marriage will last, not because of the cat\u2026but can you really say it\u2019s a marriage when you are LDR. Like I understand in the dating phase, not so much marriage, but it could also be my skewed viewed in this matter. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "When you marry a person, you also take on their dependents.

For that matter, I find it hard to understand how it\u2019s acceptable for the two of you to be apart for 3 years as a married couple. Are you sure this is a happy, loving relationship? I\u2019m seeing some big time red flags.", "NTA. 3 years is a long time to expect you to be the sole caregiver for his pets without even asking you first.", "As a pet owner you are absolutely NTA. This isn\u2019t pet sitting, he\u2019s literally giving you his cats while he goes off to take some posh job in another country.  A pet is a responsibility which you didn\u2019t sign up for but he did. If he doesn\u2019t want to take these cats, it\u2019s not fair he expects you to keep them and take over the care and ownership of them. When he adopted them he should have considered that he would have to take them if he moves! Who gets 4 cats without considering this? Maybe if he got one cat it would\u2019ve been easy to take it upon moving but 4 is too hard for him, but still, a pet is not a toy and he should\u2019ve considered this. It\u2019s not up to you to adopt his pets and anyone who says otherwise is being ridiculous.", "NTA. 3 years and having to take care of 4 pets umm yeah no. Bigger question why are you and the pets not moving with him?? What\u2019s the guarantee that he will come back after 3yrs?", "NTA \n\n3 years is a long time if you don\u2019t love cats. \n\nPlus you will need to sort them every time you want to be somewhere else. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility. \n\nMy cat is a challenge because he only loves his home! It\u2019s a cattery or a pet sitter. Which will be expensive with 4 cats. So who shoulders those expenses", "INFO: Was there no discussion before he took this job? Not once about the cats and if he would take them? What if you were able to go with him, what would the cats be doing then?", "INFO: could this actually be about something aside from cats? He is leaving for 3 years, and I am wondering if that is where your guys's feelings are really coming from right now.", "Info: do you live together and will you remain in the same home as the cats?", "Your ex husband wanted too much", "NTA -  this is hard but I agree with OP that weekend or shorter time frames is expected.  However a 3 year commitment to them is excessive IMO.", "NTA 3 years is way too fucking long if you didn't/don't want pets", "Why not take them with him? Depending on country of origin and destination, relocating pets internationally is totally doable with minimal time in quarantine.", "NTA - I was so ready to say you're the a****le until I got to the 3 years.

If it was 3 days or even months that would be different.", "NTA, you're not the one who took on the cats and three years means you're basically adopting them. It's a shitty situation, but if pets are not your cup of tea he should consider asking friend/relative to adopt them", "NTA the cats have to go with him to his new home.

One of the first things he should have discussed with you **before** accepting the overseas jobs was who would take care of the cats.  Seriously, 3 years is a huge commitment for taking care of just one cat, but four cats for 3 years?  This is not just feeding/watering & scooping multiple litter boxes.  You'd be responsible for all veterinary care, including any emergency care too.  He needs to re-home them before he leaves.  Good luck with that, unless he knows someone who is willing to take them in.", "IDGAF about the 3 years. He needs to know you have is back. \nYTA", "NTA- He needs to take them with him or rehome them. Three years is a long time for a human, let alone a kitty. You will just build resentment if you have to look after them and whatever anyone says, a cat isn't necessarily \"easy\" to take care of, let alone 4 of them for 3 years.", "NTA. Three years isn't just watching the cats, it's being a foster home. That is too much responsibility to ask of someone who doesn't want the responsibility of having pets. If you don't want to take care of them, then that is your right to say so. You're definitely not an asshole.", "Initial thoughts: sounds like YTA blah blah, but I bet you babysit at some point, blah blah. 3 FREAKING YEARS!? Nope. Not the asshole", "NTA.\n\nIf it were just a weekend or something I would say otherwise, but 3 years is a long time.", "I'd go totally ahole bc of the individualism and selfishness in the beginning, but when I came to the 3 years part I started to think the real selfish here is your husband. Also I truly don't know how a marriage dynamic can fit in a 3 FCKIN YEAR distance.\n\nNTA, but you better check it, sounds very weird.", "I wouldnt want the responsibility either.", "NTA. 3 years is a long time.", "NTA Especially after you said 3 years. He should either find someone who will semi adopt them like a friend, or perhaps pay a sitter to come each day to clean and take care of cats. I mean you would give them food if they ate it all i guess.", "Somehow I was thinking 3 weeks. Even 3 months maaaybe. Bet 3 years? Whoa, whoa, whoa ...\nNTA", "Nta \nI was gonna vote the opposite until I got to the 3yr part!\nSurely he should be taking her and the cats with him. It's not a trip, it's a semi permanent move", "NTA and I feel like the ppl who are saying y t a have not owned more than 2 cats at a time. I was leaning heavily towards yes before you brought up 3 years. With getting himself a new home wherever he's going, he should plan to bring his cats. Especially since that's such a big risk to your marriage and you don't want them. If you wanted to be kind, perhaps you could split the cats, but this all seems insane to me. He should just not move if he doesn't want to plan for his cats and marriage as a part of this new step.", "NTA. Like you said\u2026 as others have said\u2026 if it was gonna be for a few days or a week, you could wrangle it or arrange for someone else to. But 3 years\u2026 yikes.", "Cats only live about 15 years. 3 years is 1/5 of these cats' entire lives. That's like if you dropped your kid off with someone for 20 years. That's insane. Why can't he take the cats with him?\n\nNTA", "NTA . He got them before he met you and there was always a possibility he was going to go abroad because of his field of work.  Did he even think it through before adopting them under those circumstances?  What was his plan before meeting you?  Pets are for life and he made a bad decision which shouldn't become your burden. \nInfo: how long yall been married?", "NTA. 3 years is a long time to take care of someone else\u2019s multiple pets.", "NAH.  He's going to another country to better provide for you both.  If you can't handle taking care of the cats by yourself, consider hiring someone to come in once a day to take care of litter, food, etc.  If you force him to re-home the cats, it'll be the end of your marriage.  Maybe it's already over since you seem to want the freedom to do whatever you want while he's away without any responsibilities.", "YTA. You married him knowing he had these cats. To me, marrying someone with pets (and kids) means taking on certain obligations. If you weren't going to take care of the cats when he couldn't, I have to say you shouldn't have married him. That's my opinion. And I'll be honest. If my spouse suddenly came forward and said 'Nope, not gonna do it, no way no how', I would be rethinking my relationship.", "If you refuse to budge why are you here?", "YTA. You're married, and you knew he had cats when you got married. 3 years is a long time, but not undoable. \n\nI'm assuming you have other shared responsibilities and assets. Do you just completely separate your lives and finances? If you both still had your own places after getting married and have no shared finances then you wouldn't be the asshole, but if that was the case why even be married.", "INFO: Is this job a single country for three years, or will he be rotating to different countries for a few months at a time? \n\nI ask because if he's in one country longer than six months he can probably bring the cats with him. (Obviously dependent on the country and if he's living in like a factory housing compound or something) Animal quarantine is typically 3-6 months last I looked. The paperwork and transferring is a pain in the butt, but if he's that attached it's worth it. \n\nReally my AH judgement is dependent on how many options/compromises you've both offered and discussed. 3 years is a really long time, and not fair to just assume leaving them with you is option A. However, you're also married to the guy. That's a little bit bigger of a life commitment than just dating,  not unreasonable ask to continue to keep pets in the house. \n\n3 years understandably feels like an overwhelming responsibility but when you break it down to what changes in your daily routine, it's feeding/litter duties and planning ahead for a weekend away. Maybe you could set some boundaries/expectations: he comes back once/twice a year for vet appointments, he invests in a self-cleaning litterbox to minimize your interaction with that, he also buys an automatic feeder/water bowl, if you want to go away for a weekend he'll pay for boarding/a cat sitter. My cat owning friends (I prefer dogs) honestly have never had an issue with \"freedom.\" They stay out late, take last minute trips, are gone more than 12 hours a day. Heck, one friend doesn't even have a sitter if she's gone less than 72 hours (automated feeding does the heavy lifting).", "I don't even know what to do with this. I was gonna say Y T A because why wouldn't you wanna help your SO by taking care of their pets? But he's gonna be gone THREE YEARS?! Like, no vacations/breaks to go back home? How do you even have a relationship with someone in that case, never mind taking care of their pets? I dunno OP.\n\nDumping them outside or at the shelter IS NOT AN OPTION. Lemme put that out there right now. Maybe reevaluate the relationship? Why can't he take the cats with him?", "They are now also your cats. YTA. It\u2019s not hard to care for cats. Feed them, water them, scoop the box", "YTA. Cats are literally the easiest creatures to take care of and they bring your husband joy. Literally just free feed them and clean the box every few days and you still have your freedom. I can't imagine being so cold to animals that show me affection. Also for you visiting him just get a damn pet sitter!\n\nedit: also just get one of those cat box robots, makes simple even simpler", "ESH - each of you is half reasonable, half extreme. He is reasonable to ask his spouse to pitch in on pet assistance but 3 years is extreme. You\u2019re reasonable to say 3 years is extreme but it\u2019s not reasonable to say you won\u2019t be involved AT ALL in the care of your spouse\u2019s beloved pets. Couldn\u2019t you like, hire somebody to handle the cleaning, feeds, etc, and you supervise them to make sure nothing crazy happens and do a yearly vet check? \n\nIf each of you totally stick to your guns, I can\u2019t see how this is going to lead to a continuing stable relationship.", "YTA. You're married. Those are your cats, doesn't matter if he had them before you got together. You got into a relationship with him knowing he had cats. You married him knowing he has cats. He didn't just suddenly bring cats home after getting married without asking you. This is a conversation yall needed to have before getting married and for sure before he committed to 3 years apart. \n\nAnd seriously cats are easy. Get automatic litter boxes and automatic feeders and you barely have to do anything. But ultimately you're responsible for these cats, like it or not. If something happened to him then what? You'd just dump them?", "So if he dropped dead, would you get rid of the cats?\n\nCuz it sounds like you ATA....", "YTA-board them when you visit him for long periods of time. Cats aren\u2019t hard to care for. You have to generally take care of the house you share, right? Just consider it an extension of that.", "That\u2019s one way to end a marriage - of course YTA", "YTA wtf is up with EVERYONE on here lmao?? UR NOT GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOUR CATS ? K they\u2019re technically ur husbands BUT yall are married. i assume u all already live together meaning you have been living with the cats for years i assume unless u literally JUST got married or something?", " \nProbably unpopular opinion but YTA. you are married. They are also you're cats once you're married. 3 years is a long time but cats don't take much effort and if you go to visit I'd bet your husband would pay for a pet sitter.", "YTA. You don\u2019t sound like partners at all. \n\nAlso, cats don\u2019t take that much work. You don\u2019t have to \u201crush home\u201d like you do with a dog. Leave food and water out, and they can be inside for a LOOOOOONG time.", "YTA. You're married. That's supposed to be forever; him being away shouldn't matter. It seems like you guys have already agreed to his leaving for that length. You sacrifice for your spouse. Four cats is a lot, but cats are easy and can be left alone for a few days.

We saw each other on the weekends and would occasionally meet up halfway midweek for dinner because they missed our kid, and we missed each other! \n\nIt sucked and was REALLY hard for us.

But three years is different than a week or weekend. \n\nThough honestly, I would do it out of love for my husband. I'm not big on owning cats myself (more of a dog person) but my partner of 12 years came into our relationship with a cat and I helped with things as needed until she died a few months ago.
