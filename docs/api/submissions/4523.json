You guys should have come to a mutual agreement about that long before he left. A lot can change in three years. What happens if one of them passes in your care?

Maybe if he got one cat it would\u2019ve been easy to take it upon moving but 4 is too hard for him, but still, a pet is not a toy and he should\u2019ve considered this.

Three years isn't just watching the cats, it's being a foster home. That is too much responsibility to ask of someone who doesn't want the responsibility of having pets.

I was leaning heavily towards yes before you brought up 3 years. With getting himself a new home wherever he's going, he should plan to bring his cats. Especially since that's such a big risk to your marriage and you don't want them. If you wanted to be kind, perhaps you could split the cats, but this all seems insane to me. He should just not move if he doesn't want to plan for his cats and marriage as a part of this new step.", "NTA.

He's going to another country to better provide for you both.  If you can't handle taking care of the cats by yourself, consider hiring someone to come in once a day to take care of litter, food, etc.  If you force him to re-home the cats, it'll be the end of your marriage.  Maybe it's already over since you seem to want the freedom to do whatever you want while he's away without any responsibilities.", "YTA. You married him knowing he had these cats. To me, marrying someone with pets (and kids) means taking on certain obligations. If you weren't going to take care of the cats when he couldn't, I have to say you shouldn't have married him. That's my opinion. And I'll be honest. If my spouse suddenly came forward and said 'Nope, not gonna do it, no way no how', I would be rethinking my relationship.", "If you refuse to budge why are you here?", "YTA. You're married, and you knew he had cats when you got married. 3 years is a long time, but not undoable. \n\nI'm assuming you have other shared responsibilities and assets. Do you just completely separate your lives and finances? If you both still had your own places after getting married and have no shared finances then you wouldn't be the asshole, but if that was the case why even be married.", "INFO: Is this job a single country for three years, or will he be rotating to different countries for a few months at a time? \n\nI ask because if he's in one country longer than six months he can probably bring the cats with him. (Obviously dependent on the country and if he's living in like a factory housing compound or something) Animal quarantine is typically 3-6 months last I looked. The paperwork and transferring is a pain in the butt, but if he's that attached it's worth it. \n\nReally my AH judgement is dependent on how many options/compromises you've both offered and discussed. 3 years is a really long time, and not fair to just assume leaving them with you is option A. However, you're also married to the guy. That's a little bit bigger of a life commitment than just dating,  not unreasonable ask to continue to keep pets in the house. \n\n3 years understandably feels like an overwhelming responsibility but when you break it down to what changes in your daily routine, it's feeding/litter duties and planning ahead for a weekend away. Maybe you could set some boundaries/expectations: he comes back once/twice a year for vet appointments, he invests in a self-cleaning litterbox to minimize your interaction with that, he also buys an automatic feeder/water bowl, if you want to go away for a weekend he'll pay for boarding/a cat sitter. My cat owning friends (I prefer dogs) honestly have never had an issue with \"freedom.\" They stay out late, take last minute trips, are gone more than 12 hours a day. Heck, one friend doesn't even have a sitter if she's gone less than 72 hours (automated feeding does the heavy lifting).", "I don't even know what to do with this. I was gonna say Y T A because why wouldn't you wanna help your SO by taking care of their pets? But he's gonna be gone THREE YEARS?! Like, no vacations/breaks to go back home? How do you even have a relationship with someone in that case, never mind taking care of their pets? I dunno OP.\n\nDumping them outside or at the shelter IS NOT AN OPTION. Lemme put that out there right now. Maybe reevaluate the relationship? Why can't he take the cats with him?", "They are now also your cats. YTA. It\u2019s not hard to care for cats. Feed them, water them, scoop the box", "YTA. Cats are literally the easiest creatures to take care of and they bring your husband joy. Literally just free feed them and clean the box every few days and you still have your freedom. I can't imagine being so cold to animals that show me affection.

You\u2019re reasonable to say 3 years is extreme but it\u2019s not reasonable to say you won\u2019t be involved AT ALL in the care of your spouse\u2019s beloved pets. Couldn\u2019t you like, hire somebody to handle the cleaning, feeds, etc, and you supervise them to make sure nothing crazy happens and do a yearly vet check? \n\nIf each of you totally stick to your guns, I can\u2019t see how this is going to lead to a continuing stable relationship.", "YTA. You're married. Those are your cats, doesn't matter if he had them before you got together. You got into a relationship with him knowing he had cats. You married him knowing he has cats. He didn't just suddenly bring cats home after getting married without asking you. This is a conversation yall needed to have before getting married and for sure before he committed to 3 years apart. \n\nAnd seriously cats are easy. Get automatic litter boxes and automatic feeders and you barely have to do anything. But ultimately you're responsible for these cats, like it or not. If something happened to him then what? You'd just dump them?", "So if he dropped dead, would you get rid of the cats?\n\nCuz it sounds like you ATA....", "YTA-board them when you visit him for long periods of time.

You don\u2019t sound like partners at all. \n\nAlso, cats don\u2019t take that much work. You don\u2019t have to \u201crush home\u201d like you do with a dog. Leave food and water out, and they can be inside for a LOOOOOONG time.", "YTA. You're married. That's supposed to be forever; him being away shouldn't matter.

For \"muh work\"- yeah right.", "Four cats for three years?", "Those cats are going to become pretty sad or even stressed because husband is suddenly gone *for 3 years?????*", "Yeah this sounds like a marriage on paper only. Whether they intended for it to be that way (beard? visa? health insurance?) or fell into it by accident, it's not going to go on this way for much longer.", "You support him taking the job because you want the benefits it will come with, but you don\u2019t want the responsibilities that also come with that choice. I do not understand how you have a functional relationship with the clear absence of communication within it. You seem to want all the benefits but none of the burdens, and your husband thought that you understood that if he needed to move you\u2019d be supporting him. If you both knew this was a possibility this is so,etching that should have been discussed a long time ago, and now the only victims will be the cats, while you and your husband carry on without a care in the world for the pets you abandon.", "We got married because we love each other and another reason. Both will leave. It's not one or the other. \n\nNo. It's no more days.\n\nIt's not just about the pets. It not about putting them above the spouse. It's about happiness. \n\nFor example let's say I am happy when he kisses me every morning  and say \" I love you and have a good day\" if he was to stop doing that. It will break me everyday. Or let's say I love video games. If He told me no more, I will feel less and less myself. Or drawing. Let's say I can't go to the store anymore. He won't get me any supplies. Kills a piece of me. It's about them going the extra mile for the ones they love even if they don't want or like to do it. What's the point and staying with someone who is not willing to do the extra work when you are in need? I have always gone the extra miles for him without him asking.", "It\u2019s absolutely terrible. I never said I thought it was a great idea or anything. Three years is a long time to maintain a life stateside while also starting a new one in another country. A normal person would move to the new work location with their wife unless something seriously major prevents it. Something is very suspicious about the whole situation.", "why is nobody picking up on this part? Going long distance for 3 years when you're married? that's nuts", "I know a couple who did that - they both had great career opportunities offered to them, but in different countries. England and Australia. They skyped every day. Visited each other whenever they could. At the end of their contracts they managed to get great jobs in the same city in the UK. Ten years on they're still happily married and settled.\n\nIt worked for them. It wouldn't work for everyone.", "I\u2019m also baffled as to how they are married but the pets aren\u2019t yet shared.", "To be fair cats can be little shits depending on their personality. \n\nOur resident but loveable tyrant can be a little dick sometimes and try to steal her older brother's food bc she's obviously starving\n\nPets and kids, there's not really a good compromise, you're on board or you're not", "Here\u2019s thing, if he knew going away like this was a possibility before they got married, he shouldn\u2019t have agreed to her stipulation for marriage that he takes all responsibility for the cats. This seems more of a \u2018I\u2019ll agree to that so they\u2019ll marry me and once that happens my spouse taking care of them is a fait accompli\u201d bait and switch.", "OP said she communicated with him multiple times that she won\u2019t take responsibility for the cats before they got married, and she\u2019s clearly communicating now.\n\nSo where is communication a problem?", "This is really common in some parts of the world... I can't imagine it, but I've heard of it a lot in Asia and North Africa where there's a huge pay disparity between neighboring countries and travel isn't easy. People will take a high paying job in a country that doesn't allow you to bring family on strict worker's visas, or the job is something like oil rigs where bringing family isn't possible, and be away from their family while they save.\n\nWe see it in the US quite a bit too, but we just don't notice it because the workers are here and their families are the ones left behind.", "Sometimes there\u2019s no choice. My husband and I have a wonderful relationship. We also have 2 kids. He was posted to another country for 3 years. We contemplated moving the whole family but my oldest had an important exam the next year so we said maybe we\u2019ll wait till he\u2019s done. Covid hit and it was actually a blessing for us because he could work from home for the year. Once it became mandatory to go back to the office, he went away alone because moving the kids for a year seemed silly. We still see each other a lot. He\u2019ll fly over for 2 weeks every 4-5 weeks and we go to him during school holidays. It was a 12-13 hour flight each way but we made it work. So even though we really do love each other, sometimes life throws curveballs and you just gotta roll with it. If the relationship is strong anyway it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference.", "This I asked op if she could move with him but haven\u2019t gotten a reply yet. I could not last 3 years without my husband", "Most companies that would move you abroad have SOME kind of system for getting a spousal visa. Moving overseas for 3 years by yourself is- absent some extreme circumstances not filled in for whatever reason- a deliberate choice. Historically it has usually meant \"I am checking out of this marriage and into whatever women are available in this new country.\" It takes people a bit to come to grips with that reality sometimes.", "You're going to lose your shit when you hear what some people have to do to make a living. There's so many immigrants who go years in a different country to make a living without their families.", "My cat was always my cat. My wife would feed her if necessary, pet her, but it ws my cat,  bought her food, paid for the doctors visits (which got quite high in the end) ad took care of her.\n\nI think it's normal that if you marry someone who doesn't care for pets, all responsibility falls on the person who got the pet.", "It is very common with horses - my husband couldn\u2019t pick my mare out of a lineup. Even with people who keep their horses at home, they always have their own horse - even when both spouses ride. It isn\u2019t uncommon on horse forums to read \u201cMy husbands horse and my own don\u2019t get along\u201d. I guess it could extend to cats, why not.", "yeah they love plastic bags and choking hazards so much you really do need to cat proof your environment and keep an eye on them", "My cat has a $10k trust fund (out of my large life insurance policy) if something happens to me because I know taking care of a cat sucks and want to be sure that all her needs are taken care of with enough leftover that her new servant is actually happy about the deal.", "They definitely can be, but they\u2019re not impossible by any stretch. It almost sounds like he threw this 3 year timeframe out there just to test her. My partner was deployed for almost 2 straight years, I think he was home for 3 months total over that timeframe and we didn\u2019t give away his dogs he had previous to meeting me. Dogs, in my opinion, are much more needy and harder to care for, neither match the commitment required for kids.", "The longest time I\u2019ve spent away from my partner since we got together is 2 weeks and it was honestly the worst. I get everyone is different,, but 3 years?? That\u2019s gotta be excessive for anyone who actually enjoys being around their partner.", "Make sure your butler doesn't get super jealous and try to ship the kitty off somewhere, I hear that's a drag", "Objectively speaking that's fair, cats are a lot more independent than dogs are\n\nAnd kids are a whole other ballpark\n\nIf she doesn't want/can't take care of animals, she shouldn't.

So I stayed with my dad and partner went to help the in-laws. After I healed up I went to stay a couple days there and then we came home together.
