Your step-daughter is an adult who should understand why someone might not want to share their bed they share with their wife. If  it was a one time thing that she was laying on top of your covers with your wife, I\u2019d say whatever. But regularly under the covers on your side of the bed\u2026 I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t that, and you\u2019re entitled to have some private space from your family even in a family home that you all share, the same that she is. \n\nWhy don\u2019t she and your wife hang out in her bed instead?", "Info: do you wear pjs in your bed when you sleep? \n\nA lot of people don\u2019t and I can understand feeling umcomfy having someone other than your partner under the covers if you sleep in bday suit.", "Yta it seems like the bed issue isnt the main problem her.

If we lose the moments with them when they present themselves, we will never have those moments. When that child moves away from home, this time her mom has with her is gone and over and your wife will miss it terribly. Leave it be and let them have their time while it's still possible.", "YTA. This is an incredibly weird and disturbing reaction to a mother-daughter bond. OP comes across as skeevy, tbh.", "NTA for being annoyed but YWBTA if you made a big deal of it. I understand, I'd definitely not want other people in my bed....its my bed... but she's just hanging out with her mom, not going in there alone, or anything super intrusive. People have differing ideas about personal space, you'll have to find somewhere more strictly yours. Your car maybe? :/ sucks but-\n\nAlso, I hate to be this person but a problem I think is happening here in the comments is people are hearing \"19 yr old stepdaughter\" and jumping to their own conclusions -_- \"my 19 year old step son gets under my covers on my side of the bed to hang out with his dad\" sounds like more people would be like \"ok yeah that's annoying.\" Because it is. But it's one of those things where unless it gets escalated/more intrusive, leave it alone and deal with the annoyance. Yall the weird ones for making it weird just cuz you heard a part of *special movie* title, OP very obviously just has personal space needs. He didn't make any weirdo comments towards his step daughter what so ever.", "NAH. You\u2019re a bit weird for being disturbed by normal family interactions, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get any boundaries. You can try to see if there is a compromise here. I\u2019ve seen a few recommendations for her not to get under the covers. Maybe there can be a throw blanket that lives on a chair and is pulled over for mom-cuddle time. Is it possible for the these cuddles to happen on the couch? If you bring this up with your wife and step-daughter, you need to be really clear that you don\u2019t mind their bonding; you just would like to keep your bed to you. Good luck with that, btw.

I totally understand wanting a place that's just yours though.\nI don't think there's a good solution here. If I were you, I would just remember that it won't last forever and that when the daughter is grown and gone, your wife will miss her dearly.

Why are you so sketched out by something so wholesome?", "NAH. they\u2019re probably used to it, but i don\u2019t like people on my side of the bed either. especially in their \u201coutside\u201d clothes. they can hang out else where, like daughter\u2019s room?", "I used to be out of town for work often, and when I was, my young stepdaughter would take my spot in bed with my husband. \n\nAll I asked was that she take a shower that evening, same as me, so I didn\u2019t get Smelly Kid Dirt all over my nice sheets. \n\nShe did of course, and they\u2019d FaceTime me together to say goodnight, every night. It was the highlight of my day. It made me happy knowing my husband had this special time to talk with his kid about her and her life. \n\nKids need and love their parents at any age.

Your wife and her could lay with a blanket but why under the covers? These Y T A votes are obviously people who have no boundaries but most of what I see on here is establishing boundaries.

It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to ask her not to lay inside your sheets and on your pillow. You are allowed spaces that are just for you inside your own home. My side of my bed is my safe place and it\u2019s exclusively for me. My children are not ever allowed to go on it. Boundaries are healthy and normal. \n\nMaybe if you\u2019re okay with it, ask your wife to lay on your side, and have your stepdaughter lay on her side?

We require the kiddos to ask permission to enter our room unless it's an emergency.

I'm guessing maybe not a lot of parents- there are so few spaces we have any sort of privacy as parents.  \n\nNTA. I believe firmly that privacy and having a safe space to yourself is good for mental health and having a healthy family.  You are not asking for too much.  I'm sure your stepdaughter has a bed that she can choose who gets in with her;  you deserve no less.  Plus,  she is 19 and an adult so I'm sure she takes up a lot of space!  You are still a good parent if you enforce healthy boundaries.", "NTA You deserve to have privacy in your sleeping space.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nYTA if you can\u2019t calmly and reasonably speak to your wife privately to help her understand how this makes you feel.

NTA! it\u2019s your space. i wouldn\u2019t ever get in my parents bed, even when i lived at home way back when i wouldn\u2019t even go lay on it outside the covers. just feels weird. people\u2019s bedrooms are their personal spaces. they can cuddle in the kid\u2019s bed if they really want to, since the only person who\u2019s bed it is is consenting to the other person being there. i know it\u2019s not happening while you\u2019re there or anything, but it still feels like an invasion of personal space to me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f again, NTA.", "YTA. Im 22 and still do this, even with dad is on the other side of the bed and ma and me talking. you dont understand womens bonding and connection. If it \"gets under your skin\" then leave the room or sit in the chair.", "YTA. This isn't about \"personal space\" if you're not in it. This is about control. I have a STRONG feeling that your stepdaughter and wife were snuggling in the bed LONG before you were in the picture. You just expect a significant bonding moment to end just because you said so? I cuddled with my mom after dad got up throughout my childhood and when I grew up I moved 4 hours away and then several states. Every time I came home I would snuggle in the bed with my mom, even into my 30s. She was my best friend for much of my adult life. She was killed by a high driver when I was 39. Do you know what I would give to snuggle with her again? Do you really want to deprive your wife and stepdaughter of this bonding experience? Do you want to continue to breed resentment between your wife, stepdaughter, and yourself? Because that's exactly what you're doing if you choose this hill. I second the chair recommendations. Time for you to create a place of ownership rather than trying to take one.", "Weird you call her a \"live at home 19yo\". You know most 19yo's live at home right? She goes anywhere the house because it's her home too, she should be welcome in every space.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA just because \n\n1.

But either talk to your wife about it, or tell them to have snuggle time on the couch and that this is your bedroom. Not a shared living space.

Don't be ridiculous.", "YTA.\nWhy does it bother you? Would you feel the same if it was your daughter?", "YTA.\n\nLiterally why does it matter. Why are you such a control freak that you have an issue with a daughter hanging out with her mother in bed?\n\nThat is not a reasonable thing to be upset about, and that is something you should seriously think about, because it\u2019s weird that you care like, at all, nonetheless enough to have to post here.", "Ask your wife to go to her daughter's bed to cuddle.\n\nYour stepdaughter wouldn't be fine with you going to her bed, she should come to yours.\n\nNTA", "YTA and you think you\u2019re competing with your step-daughter for your wife\u2019s attention.

If she were your kid, odds are it wouldn\u2019t cause the same reaction (not saying it is on purpose).  As long as she is not infringing on your/your wife\u2019s alone time, let it go.  I guess another alternative is make sure your step daughter has a comfy queen/king bed so your wife can snuggle with her in her own room.", "NTA. Beds are private, intimate spaces and sharing isn\u2019t necessary. I get very annoyed if anyone besides my husband tries to get into our bed; having any adult, family or not, climbing into your bed is weird.

It\u2019s the best place for open conversations, working through heartbreak, figuring out life, and learning how to process their fathers illness.

I know where you are coming from because I wasn\u2019t allowed in my parents room, never cuddled on the bed and worked out life\u2019s turmoil. It was hard to learn to let it go.
