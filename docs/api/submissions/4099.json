You cannot be a traitor to a sperm donor you never met.", "NTA, find better friends.", "So NTA.\n\nJust because a guy ejaculates and makes someone pregnant, that doesn't make him a father.\n\nMy biological father walked out on us when I was a baby. In 1998, I found out he was dying of cancer and had the chance to go and meet him.\n\nI didn't. And I have never regretted it. \n\nHe wasn't my father. He was a sperm donor. I was sorry for him that his life was ending, but it had nothing to do with me.  \n\nPeople make choices in their lives.
