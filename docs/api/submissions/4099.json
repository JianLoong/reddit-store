Especially because he throws a tantrum because he doesn't get to have a \"son\" that is who or what he wants. Your friends have no right to judge this situation and should butt out", "It\u2019s funny how he think he have a right after abandoning you for 20 years and never contribute to your education!He is your progenitor not your father,your step dad was the one who take the role! \nYou did right to block that crazy racist person and don\u2019t listen to those friends !!", "You need better friends. You bio dad is an asshole for expecting you to wait for him to come back to your life so you have a father figure. Your stepdad sounds like an amazing man, and anyone who talks shit about him doesn\u2019t deserve your time. I hope you block your bio dad from all social media as well. Hope your mom blocked him too.", "**NTA**\n\nSo happy to hear a story where Mom decides everything changes now for her child, and that she married a man who obviously loves her and you, plus a whole family full of love!\n\nAnd if that's not enough coolness, you're bi-lingual and have had the amazing experience of living abroad! So glad your mom and dad met, fell in love, and got married!\n\nYour mom showed strength of character, and intelligence, by saying no more than *he wasn't ready to be a parent.*\n\nSo you showed the good manners and dignity with which you were raised by being courteous to bio-dad when he reached out. Calling you *a traitor*? To what? A mythical parent who certainly knew of your existence but never made contact or support and thought you'd run to him like a kid in a 1950s movie and you'd be tight forever?\n\nThat he can't show gratitude to your parents for how they raised you and love you is sad.", "This x 100000. NTA. Fuck that guy.", ">But my friends keep saying that it's natural he feels threatened and jealous, and I overreacted and should give him another chance to get to know him.\n\nWhy is it that so many people who post on here have *really* lousy friends? I mean, seriously. NTA OP, at all. He's almost 40, he's been out of your life for 20 years, he should dang well *know* that you had your own life. And, as someone who grew up in the system unless he spent the last 20 years in a bottle or impaled on a needle in an alley, he should know you make your own family when you can. He ***is*** probably riding high on jealousy right now(your 'friends' are right on that), but that's ***NOT YOUR PROBLEM. Him taking out anything on you or your mother is an instant call to cut contact.*** Him 'striking out' in jealousy and hurt shows you his character.", "Seems bio dad still isn't mature enough to be anyone's dad by his reaction.", "I'm really glad you are saying that because to me it sounded absurd when he began calling me a traitor. It felt so unfair to hear those things at that moment, and it was almost like he was disappointed that I had a good life with a good family, instead of being more like him, I suppose. \n\nThank you for the advice.", "Can't argue with that...\n\nBut I did see the point they were trying to make. It's still hard though to even imagine a future relationship with that person.", "My first thoughts were also about how he has skipped out on child support\u2014then to probably needing money or an organ match.\n\nPart of me also understands that since he was in the system and aged out, he may hold lifelong issues and resentment towards people who were able to grow up with a family. Part of me thinks that he assumed that OP grew up in a single-parent household and struggled with not having a family (like sperm donor) and then projected his anger on OP when he finds out that he has been replaced completely by a stepfather who really stepped up to be a father to OP.\n\nHowever, what really took away any sympathy for the sperm donor was calling OP a traitor for something that is out of control for a child, whether that\u2019s who OP\u2019s mother wants to marry or moving to Korea for years.\n\nEven though there was no bridge to begin with, the sperm donor destroyed the connection just as quickly as he introduced himself. He was fine for 20 years without attempted contact, he\u2019s just not fine with seeing that OP is thriving without him.\n\nNTA", "> ignore your friends. Their opinions absolutely 100 percent do not matter\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! Why do the people who post on this sub have such judgmental friends?", "I'm really sorry you went through that. \n\nI mean, I'm optimistic by nature, but right now I can't even imagine any type of relationship with him. I was never planning to pursue a father-son relationship, but a civil one would've been nice.", "My mom was a teenager as well and my stepdad is only three years older than him. And he still used his income, his time, and his love, and also went against his family's wishes (at first they were very much against the relationship with my mom) to raise a kid that wasn't his responsibility. So, all those jabs at him is what I can't really look past. That whole experience made me appreciate the dad who raised me even more.", "Fuck his friends too.", "It ***was*** absurd.  Turns out, he did you a favor by being absent.  He can go back to that.  NTA", "It definitely was absurd. Dude walks out, comes back 20 years later, expects you not to call the man who raised you dad? My mind boggles.", "NTA! Your biofather is rude.", "If he cannot see that he completely rejected you as a baby by walking out of your life and it was a blessing your step father was there to step in and provide you with a father figure in your life then frankly hes emotionally immature and still not ready to be anything like a dad to you same as when he was younger. Calling you a traitor is absolutely ridiculous. \nSometimes we want to see our parents as someone to look up to but in your situation having the perspective to see your bio father as an emotionally stunted person who hasnt grown as a person at all and cannot provide you with the fatherhood you needed is what you probably need to let go of him as a \u201cdad\u201d", "The point they were missing though is that adults are responsible for their own emotions. He can feel whatever he needs to, but these are literally the consequences of his own actions. He doesn't get to fob it off on you. Your friends sound emotionally immature.", "Their points have a shit ton of holes and it's not even a legitimate point. My Dad left me when I was a baby and when he decided to come back into my life all he did was talk shit about my Mom. My friends have told me that I need to give him a break. I am no longer friends with those people.", "What point? Sure he can feel jealousy, but to express this to you would be wrong, he only has himself to blame for leaving, he has himself to blame for feeling that way. If anything he should be thanking your dad for raising you and doing what he couldn't.", "I\u2019m hoping you get to deviate from my experience and one day have a civil relationship. I will play devil\u2019s advocate for my own stance and echo what I saw here that I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of processing he\u2019s got to do on his own about how he probably was not expecting the results of his own actions and again that\u2019s a long road of personal reflection.", "And the horse he rode in on!", "[rude indeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UzEcLoworc&t=27s)", ">He doesn't get to fob it off on you.\n\nAnd especially not OP's mother."]}
