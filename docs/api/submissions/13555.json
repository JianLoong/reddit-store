They have been nice but we don\u2019t really talk at all which is fine with me. I moved in around Feb and I mostly keep to myself and just go to work. \n\nMy landlord (50s M) told me they would be leaving to go out of the country because his parent was in critical condition. He took his entire family with him which is his wife and kids. They asked me to look out for packages and stuff while they\u2019re gone which is not a big deal so I said okay and to have a safe flight etc. \n\nA week later (today) he texts me and says his kids would be coming back but not him about a week from now. He asked me to take his kids to school until he gets back. I don\u2019t know when exactly that is. \n\nThe reason I think I might be the asshole is because I think it\u2019s an insane request to ask a tenant that just lives here and I don\u2019t know if they have any other family here. But I also know we live in a high cost of living area and this house is probably worth more than I could ever afford so I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s my responsibility to take care of my landlords children, he could probably pay for a ride share service or something else. For reference the kids are at least 17 I believe. My mom says I\u2019m an asshole for not being helpful and that it\u2019s selfish. \n\nI have a job that I can work from home and maybe have time to take them (I start about an hour after I would take them to school). I haven\u2019t called him about it yet because I feel bad but like I said I have a full time job and live in a big city. If I want to go into the office or am required to for anything (I had already made plans to go into the office next week for something I have to do for example) I don\u2019t have time to take them because it takes over an hour to get there.  \n\nI genuinely think it\u2019s an insane thing to ask a random tenant to do without consideration of my job or my life, he just said \u201cI won\u2019t be coming back and I need you to take my kids to school for an undisclosed amount of time.\u201d Granted I have not called him yet to hear more and the circumstances are out of his control so I don\u2019t know if I am the asshole and should take his kids to school.", "created_utc": 1680184850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126o20s/wibta_for_thinking_its_a_weird_thing_for_my/", "score": 550, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My biggest critique here is that, it would appear, that your landlord is assuming you will accept. However, losing a parent or caring for a sick parent will flip your world upside down. Which is why, I would suggest dealing with this very delicately. \n\nHonestly this is a big ask and it will be a pretty big commitment on your part. I don\u2019t see you being the AH if you decline. \n\nBut, If I was in your position I would accept, but under certain conditions. If you decide to accept, you absolutely must address and set ground rules in some key areas;\n\n\n1.\tEstablish that you have responsibilities that take precedence over his children. You may not always be in the best position to provide for them due to your career. I would even suggest that he find someone more suitable for his request, but that you would accept in the event he has no other choice, but under certain conditions. \n2.\tCompensation; you absolutely should request your rent be reduced, or even waived, while you care for his children. Additionally, any expenses that you pay for will need to be either reimbursed by him, or provided by him prior to making any purchases. Think food, household items, transportation to/from school. Get this in writing! I cannot stress this enough. \n3.\tDetermine how long he plans to be away for, additionally, provide stipulations that if he does not return by then you will receive x amount of compensation. Also in writing. \n4.\tI would also make the demand that he needs to establish an additional caretaker or babysitter as a backup so that you can rely on if you need it. Again, you have your own life and responsibilities that have been established, he cannot expect you to alter your life on such short notice. \n5.\tI would also suggest having a conversation with him and his children regarding your authority and the consequences that they would face if they disobey. \n\n\nThis is all I can think of right now, but I would absolutely request this it the bare minimum. Come up with your own personal specifications of how you want the situation to be, in the event you even choose to accept. Good luck!", "NTA if you choose to refuse - it is a weird request (though I wonder if it's a cultural thing as well - is the landlord from a different country where perhaps this wouldn't be considered an unreasonable request?)\n\nHowever: You should really talk to him first before you make a decision. You need to understand what it would entail to say yes, if any compensation is offered (like money off your rent), and get a timeline of how long he believes it will be before he returns.\n\nIf the children are older (you said they're probably 17), can't they arrange to get a ride with friends?", "So his kids are either adults, or near-adults, and are presumably pretty self-sufficient given that he's sending them home without a parent or other guardian (and he's sending them home from abroad...)\n\nDo they not have access to a car? Surely he owns a car, which is parked at the home? Why can't the kids drive themselves to school? Is there no parking at their school? Can they not drive? Is there not a school bus?\n\nIt seems like a pretty big thing to ask, but he's probably also not thinking straight because he's worried about his ill parent. But he's not actually asking you to care for the kids at all - just give them a ride to school. And to be honest with you, if I was in your situation, and I could arrange things so that I was free to drive the kids to school, I would. Presumably he knows you generally work from home, so he has a reasonable idea that this would be feasible for you. \n\nNAH", "NTA he may have asked you because you live at the house and he thinks you're available- this is an emergency situation for him so it's not something he could have planned. That being said it's ok to let him know you're not going to be available to take his kids, you may not be his only option, just his first", "NAH.\n\nI honestly do not think it\u2019s weird that he asked you.  But you\u2019re not an AH if you say no.", "NAH - sounds like he is in a tough spot and didn't plan for certain contingencies. That said, it's not exactly your responsibility either.  Luckily, we're talking about \"children\" who are within months of being full-grown adults, so it might be as simple as \"make sure there are no parties and they go to school.\" I'd try to clear that up and then talk about a reduced / free rent for a month depending on what's involved, _e.g._ is he expecting you to feed them?", "NAH yet. Asking you is fine, as long as he respects a \"no\". His assholery isn't determined yet. If this doesn't interfere with other commitments or your sleep schedule, perhaps attempt to negotiate a price for this favour, but you don't need to do this.", "NTA.\n\nBut it is not like he is asking you to actually babysit infants or toddlers.  As you posted, these are teenagers.  So in essence you are being asked to make sure they don't have parties, and that they go to and come home from school.  Very minimal supervision. \n\nIf it were me, I would say 'Yes, I can\".  I would not discuss any financial compensation until the owners return.", "NAH. He's under a ton of stress and clearly reaching for the simplest solution in terms of convenience to himself - you're right there, this way he doesn't have to organise for other people to come and go from wherever they live.\n\nYou on the other hand are under no obligation to say yes. I probably would in your place because I would be overthinking to the point of anxiety, whether the possibility of him getting pissy and kicking me out, or the idea of strangers coming to pick up the kids, etc.\n\nIf you do decide to help him out, make sure you agree to reduce your rent for at least the gas money you'd spend, if not more, and regardless of your decision make sure the kids have been told some rules and boundaries, I can easily see them thinking this is the perfect time to throw a party.", "Ywbta.  He asked you a question.  He knows you, and he trusts you with his kids. How is that weird?  \n\nYou either say yes because you want to help him out. Or simply say no.

It just adds too much time to my commute each day. You'll need to make another arrangement.\" She then became angry WITH ME! She had the nerve to say, \"Well, what am I supposed to do now? I was counting on you. My husband leaves for work too early.\" I said, \"Lily, maybe you can speak to HR and see if they'll tell you if anyone else lives closer to you that you could ask.

I also work from home and have flexible hours, so I agreed to. She subtracted the amount I would\u2019ve made ($15 per hour) from my rent the following month. This was fine, until she followed up the next day with a list of dates she\u2019d need me to babysit again (totaling over two weeks worth of days). I politely declined as I\u2019m in my thirties and no longer a nanny. Luckily she understood, but just remember, if you give a mouse a cookie\u2026.", "That guy has a lot of nerve.  That's one big pile of stinky BS if you ask me.", "This is definitely weird. I would reply\n\n\"Hey [Landlord], I'm sorry, I'm needed to work in the office several days that week, so I won't be here in the mornings to take them to school. Is there another school parent who could help? Wishing your family well through this difficult time\"", "> nearest person with a vagina\n\nI didn't immediately jump to that conclusion; I saw it more as \"the person who already lives in the house with the children who has no emotional attachment to the situation we're enduring.\"", "I think rich kids only travel by zeppelin and their legs are made of gelato", "nah, getting someone's kids to school in the morning is still \"watching\" them to some degree. i don't have kids because i don't want kids. yes, i am home at that time. no, i will not take your kids to school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe entitlement to other people's labor is what's wild.", "Yeah I was thinking it was an Indian American OP and an Indian landlord haha or someone of the same culture as OP\u2026 it seems they have to go out of the country to visit family.", "For clarification I have a completely separate living area and we do not see each other at all during day to day. I have my own entrance and the house is connected technically but I have seen them maybe twice, my landlord maybe 5 times due to things needing to be worked on and never officially met the kids. But I see where you are coming from.", "I don't believe you're as dense as you're acting.  When there is a power imbalance, \"asking\" for help is not really just asking because the person being asked is pressured to do something or face an adverse consequence from the person with the power - the same reason it's unacceptable for a boss to make a pass at their subordinate.  Perhaps you're that person who thinks it's ok to do that - no, it really isn't.  OP should not feel pressured to say yes because of [the implication](https://youtu.be/-yUafzOXHPE) that she will end up having to find a new place to live if she doesn't accept becoming the landlord's uncompensated nanny.", "Agreed.", "Take out the \"next few weeks\" no need to give him a reason to ask again", "Yes, this! You\u2019re just not available. Don\u2019t apologize, don\u2019t over explain. You can\u2019t do it and hope everything works out for them, the end. Saying anything extra just gives them ammunition.", "Agree, but don\u2019t think they need to give any reasons, because then it will become a negotiation. OP just needs to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not something I can do.\u201d The boudaries are clear.", "I wouldn't mention that work prevents you from doing it - simply say you cannot, he doesn't need a reason or time frame to try to weasel around.", " \u0442\u043dis \u00b9\u2218\u2218% !!", "Absolutely. My friend \"Julie\" lived next door to a single mom, \"Liz\". They became friendly just by virtue of living next door to each other, and one Saturday Liz came over in a tizzy because her sitter backed out at the last minute and Liz had to work. So, Julie, being the kind person she is, offered to watch Liz's son for the day. Liz offered to pay, but Julie declined. Julie watched Liz's son for EIGHT HOURS. Liz came back, was very thankful and Julie thought that was that.\n\nWell, no, now Liz decided that Julie was her fall-back person for when she couldn't get a sitter. Julie obliged the first couple of times, but one day, Julie and her family were getting ready to head out for the day and were loading up the car. Liz comes running over - \"Julie, Julie, I don't have a sitter today. Can you help?\" Julie actually said, \"No, Liz, I can't. We're heading out to visit my brother in NYC for the day and won't be around.\" Liz had the NERVE to say to Julie, \"Can't you just take my son along with you? I don't know what I'm going to do.\" Unbelieveable! Julie finally grew a back bone and said \"No, Liz, my brother is only expecting the four of us and we want to spend time together as a family. You'll need to find another arrangement. You seem to be running into problems a lot - you should find a more dependable sitter or a backup sitter.\" Liz got very snippy with Julie and was like \"Thanks for nothing. Guess I'll just have to call out now.\" Julie was like, \"Yeah, guess you will\", got in the car and left.\n\nLiz was very cold to Julie for the next few weeks, but since beggars have NO shame, Liz came around a few weeks later asking Julie to babysit. Julie just said \"no\" and closed the door. That was the end of their interactions and, thankfully, Liz ended up moving a couple months later. Buh-bye.", "I don't think that you did jump to that conclusion. I think the landlord did, though.", "I agree if you don't want to babysit then don't. If you don't want to give someone a ride also fine. Giving a ride isn't babysitting. How is asking a question being entitled? Don't know unless you ask.", "Yeah I hadn\u2019t thought about that, could definitely be the landlord feels entitled to OP\u2019s help because she\u2019s from \u201cback home\u201d and automatically assumes OP would help without a problem", "They didn't ask. They told. That is entitled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you know who you get to pick up or drop off your kids if mom, dad, gma, gpa, aunt, uncle, etc. are not available? You get a babysitter. Lol.", "They didn't tell them. OP literally says the texted and asked if she'd give the kid to ride to school until they got back she hasn't replied back yet so what are you talking about? I don't know why it is such a hard concept for you but giving someone a ride is not the same as babysitting. At all. It's called helping out. I wouldn't do it without gas money but other than that I don't see an issue with being asked. It's because OP is there and it's most convenient I assume. But again a simple \"no\" will do."]}
