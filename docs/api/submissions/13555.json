They have been nice but we don\u2019t really talk at all which is fine with me. I moved in around Feb and I mostly keep to myself and just go to work. \n\nMy landlord (50s M) told me they would be leaving to go out of the country because his parent was in critical condition. He took his entire family with him which is his wife and kids. They asked me to look out for packages and stuff while they\u2019re gone which is not a big deal so I said okay and to have a safe flight etc. \n\nA week later (today) he texts me and says his kids would be coming back but not him about a week from now. He asked me to take his kids to school until he gets back. I don\u2019t know when exactly that is. \n\nThe reason I think I might be the asshole is because I think it\u2019s an insane request to ask a tenant that just lives here and I don\u2019t know if they have any other family here. But I also know we live in a high cost of living area and this house is probably worth more than I could ever afford so I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s my responsibility to take care of my landlords children, he could probably pay for a ride share service or something else. For reference the kids are at least 17 I believe. My mom says I\u2019m an asshole for not being helpful and that it\u2019s selfish. \n\nI have a job that I can work from home and maybe have time to take them (I start about an hour after I would take them to school). I haven\u2019t called him about it yet because I feel bad but like I said I have a full time job and live in a big city. If I want to go into the office or am required to for anything (I had already made plans to go into the office next week for something I have to do for example) I don\u2019t have time to take them because it takes over an hour to get there.  \n\nI genuinely think it\u2019s an insane thing to ask a random tenant to do without consideration of my job or my life, he just said \u201cI won\u2019t be coming back and I need you to take my kids to school for an undisclosed amount of time.\u201d Granted I have not called him yet to hear more and the circumstances are out of his control so I don\u2019t know if I am the asshole and should take his kids to school.", "created_utc": 1680184850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126o20s/wibta_for_thinking_its_a_weird_thing_for_my/", "score": 1351, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My biggest critique here is that, it would appear, that your landlord is assuming you will accept. However, losing a parent or caring for a sick parent will flip your world upside down. Which is why, I would suggest dealing with this very delicately. \n\nHonestly this is a big ask and it will be a pretty big commitment on your part. I don\u2019t see you being the AH if you decline. \n\nBut, If I was in your position I would accept, but under certain conditions. If you decide to accept, you absolutely must address and set ground rules in some key areas;\n\n\n1.\tEstablish that you have responsibilities that take precedence over his children. You may not always be in the best position to provide for them due to your career. I would even suggest that he find someone more suitable for his request, but that you would accept in the event he has no other choice, but under certain conditions. \n2.\tCompensation; you absolutely should request your rent be reduced, or even waived, while you care for his children. Additionally, any expenses that you pay for will need to be either reimbursed by him, or provided by him prior to making any purchases. Think food, household items, transportation to/from school. Get this in writing! I cannot stress this enough. \n3.\tDetermine how long he plans to be away for, additionally, provide stipulations that if he does not return by then you will receive x amount of compensation. Also in writing. \n4.\tI would also make the demand that he needs to establish an additional caretaker or babysitter as a backup so that you can rely on if you need it. Again, you have your own life and responsibilities that have been established, he cannot expect you to alter your life on such short notice. \n5.\tI would also suggest having a conversation with him and his children regarding your authority and the consequences that they would face if they disobey. \n\n\nThis is all I can think of right now, but I would absolutely request this it the bare minimum. Come up with your own personal specifications of how you want the situation to be, in the event you even choose to accept. Good luck!", "NTA if you choose to refuse - it is a weird request (though I wonder if it's a cultural thing as well - is the landlord from a different country where perhaps this wouldn't be considered an unreasonable request?)\n\nHowever: You should really talk to him first before you make a decision. You need to understand what it would entail to say yes, if any compensation is offered (like money off your rent), and get a timeline of how long he believes it will be before he returns.\n\nIf the children are older (you said they're probably 17), can't they arrange to get a ride with friends?", "So his kids are either adults, or near-adults, and are presumably pretty self-sufficient given that he's sending them home without a parent or other guardian (and he's sending them home from abroad...)\n\nDo they not have access to a car? Surely he owns a car, which is parked at the home? Why can't the kids drive themselves to school? Is there no parking at their school? Can they not drive? Is there not a school bus?\n\nIt seems like a pretty big thing to ask, but he's probably also not thinking straight because he's worried about his ill parent. But he's not actually asking you to care for the kids at all - just give them a ride to school. And to be honest with you, if I was in your situation, and I could arrange things so that I was free to drive the kids to school, I would. Presumably he knows you generally work from home, so he has a reasonable idea that this would be feasible for you. \n\nNAH", "NTA he may have asked you because you live at the house and he thinks you're available- this is an emergency situation for him so it's not something he could have planned. That being said it's ok to let him know you're not going to be available to take his kids, you may not be his only option, just his first", "NAH.\n\nI honestly do not think it\u2019s weird that he asked you.  But you\u2019re not an AH if you say no.", "NAH - sounds like he is in a tough spot and didn't plan for certain contingencies. That said, it's not exactly your responsibility either.  Luckily, we're talking about \"children\" who are within months of being full-grown adults, so it might be as simple as \"make sure there are no parties and they go to school.\" I'd try to clear that up and then talk about a reduced / free rent for a month depending on what's involved, _e.g._ is he expecting you to feed them?", "NAH yet. Asking you is fine, as long as he respects a \"no\". His assholery isn't determined yet. If this doesn't interfere with other commitments or your sleep schedule, perhaps attempt to negotiate a price for this favour, but you don't need to do this.", "NTA.\n\nBut it is not like he is asking you to actually babysit infants or toddlers.  As you posted, these are teenagers.  So in essence you are being asked to make sure they don't have parties, and that they go to and come home from school.  Very minimal supervision. \n\nIf it were me, I would say 'Yes, I can\".  I would not discuss any financial compensation until the owners return.", "NAH. He's under a ton of stress and clearly reaching for the simplest solution in terms of convenience to himself - you're right there, this way he doesn't have to organise for other people to come and go from wherever they live.\n\nYou on the other hand are under no obligation to say yes. I probably would in your place because I would be overthinking to the point of anxiety, whether the possibility of him getting pissy and kicking me out, or the idea of strangers coming to pick up the kids, etc.\n\nIf you do decide to help him out, make sure you agree to reduce your rent for at least the gas money you'd spend, if not more, and regardless of your decision make sure the kids have been told some rules and boundaries, I can easily see them thinking this is the perfect time to throw a party.", "Ywbta.  He asked you a question.  He knows you, and he trusts you with his kids. How is that weird?  \n\nYou either say yes because you want to help him out. Or simply say no.

It just adds too much time to my commute each day. You'll need to make another arrangement.\" She then became angry WITH ME! She had the nerve to say, \"Well, what am I supposed to do now? I was counting on you. My husband leaves for work too early.\" I said, \"Lily, maybe you can speak to HR and see if they'll tell you if anyone else lives closer to you that you could ask.

Julie obliged the first couple of times, but one day, Julie and her family were getting ready to head out for the day and were loading up the car. Liz comes running over - \"Julie, Julie, I don't have a sitter today. Can you help?\" Julie actually said, \"No, Liz, I can't. We're heading out to visit my brother in NYC for the day and won't be around.\" Liz had the NERVE to say to Julie, \"Can't you just take my son along with you? I don't know what I'm going to do.\" Unbelieveable! Julie finally grew a back bone and said \"No, Liz, my brother is only expecting the four of us and we want to spend time together as a family. You'll need to find another arrangement.
