Because they live a few states from us, we don't get around to seeing them in person very often. We both took time off work and flew in the week before the 25th. It wasn't my dream way to use my PTO or spend the holidays, but it was valuable family time for my wife that we hadn't gotten in a while.\n\nTwo days after we arrived, I got a heart wrenching call from my closest friend (26m) telling me his father likely wasn't going to make it. I knew he had been in the hospital for a while, but now it looked like things were taking a turn for the worst. This is someone I've known since I was 16, whose family I'm closer to than my in-laws. This is also a person who is extremely selfless and rarely asks for anything for himself. When he asked me to come be with him, I dropped everything to make that happen. There\u2019s no limit on what I would did rhim on a good day, so in circumstances like these\u2026 coming home felt like the only option. \n\nFlights around that time aren't always easy to come by and the one I booked was fairly expensive. In my rush to get home as quickly as possible, I ended up booking the ticket under mine and my wife's shared bank account. Once I realized this mistake, I immediately transferred money from my account to cover it.\n\nMy wife was not happy about any of it. She begrudgingly offered to come with me, but I declined saying that most of my time would likely be spent in a hospital waiting room. I didn't want her to be at home alone during the holidays, or awkwardly standing by as I comforted Friend. I reassured her that I would be back before the 25th, and that she should continue her family time as usual.\n\nThat didn't end up happening. Friend's father passed the following day and with grief, funeral preparations, and a lack of viable flights, I didn't end up getting to come back to be with my wife and her family. Me missing Christmas has gotten thrown in my face a lot since then and it always makes me uncomfortable.

Unless you are violating a principle, you should be seeking harmony with the person you love most. I'm going to assume that's your wife. So lay down your arms, and tell her that you want to really talk about it when you're not angry and fighting and you want to know how you can soothe her heart. She may be being unfair.

She was excited to spend time with her family, so she's allowed to feel disappointed about leaving, but she prioritized being with you and offered to leave with you. \n\nIt really does come off that you mostly just saw an excuse to escape her family celebration, immediately took it, and are blithely hoping the next years ahead will be the comfy status quo for you again.

Every. single. one. of my close friends started booking plane tickets that day.  There was never any question that they would come to be with me, to support me, to go to the funeral.

Figuring out how to handle holidays with family spread out is an important thing early on in a marriage.  There can be a lot of fighting around the topic.  If you are a decent partner, there should be give and take on both sides. If celebrating Christmas with her family is something that is important to your wife, it should be something you make happen at an agreed upon frequency.  There should be no resentment about how you are \"wasting\" your PTO for this, because this should be an established plan.  That you treat with respect and support.  And when that plan fell apart, as it did this past year, you should have made an effort to do it again.\n\nYour wife wants to celebrate Christmas with you AND her family.

Be extra gracious and extra generous.", "He says it's been thrown in his face a lot since then and considering this was just last Christmas, it's safe to say it's been brought up at non Xmas times as well. \n\nI don't think any of that is entirely relevant to the question.", "Yeah I don\u2019t feel like we have the information needed to make an AITA judgement, in large part because we have so little insight into the processes by which decisions were made or communicated.

For example, did OP talk to his wife before booking the ticket? Etc.\n\nWith so much info about communication missing, it\u2019s hard to know who was being an AH or even if anyone was. I don\u2019t think the OPs actions in and of themselves were wrong, and was actually a bit surprised by all the Y T A comments. If I were in OP\u2019s wife\u2019s shoes I would have wanted my spouse to go be with his friend/ say goodbye to Friend\u2019s dad and I probably would have wanted to stay with my family. Maybe I would have been annoyed about the unfulfilled \u201cI\u2019ll be back by Xmas\u201d promise, but I also know that when my spouse is stressed he can be hilariously unrealistic about how logistics will pan out. However, my spouse and I also work our butts off at communicating clearly, and we don\u2019t operate according to the expectation that being married means we always put each other first even to the detriment of other relationships or our own basic needs.\n\nBasically I think the OP is posing the problem to the wrong audience. Was he an AH? Eh, maybe, maybe not. The behavior wasn\u2019t so egregious that it should still be coming up a year later. OP, maybe seek advice (preferably professional if that\u2019s accessible to you) on how to improve communication within your relationship and have more productive arguments?

It is not a reflection on anyone or anyone's preferences.\n\n*\"So you would drop everything on a moments notice for your friend, but apparently in combination with the last quote, would not drop everything to spend time with your wife's family-- that takes too much PTO.\"*\n\nThe notion that there is no difference between using PTO for a regularly-scheduled, recurring holiday and to say goodbye to a man who played a prominent role in your life for years and to support your devastated good friend going thru trauma during a holiday is, frankly, embarrassing.\n\n\"I get that's not an ideal way to spend Christmas, but my man, she just wanted to be with you!\"\n\nThis is a terrible option, and there's no indication that she wanted this. She certainly didn't jump in and say, \"Honey, don't worry... I'll make the plans. You go pack.\" The OP would then be responsible for a person while trying to be in deep emotional work with his friend and dying father. And if she's giving him grief a year later about this, I can't imagine she wouldn't be sitting in the waiting room complaining about how Xmas is ruined. \n\nOP found himself in a shit situation, and struggled through it best he could. Wasn't perfect.", "His friend didn\u2019t invite him on a last minute fishing trip, you know? OP\u2019s best friend\u2019s father, a man he was incredibly close to himself, *died*. That sort of trumps most things. \u201cDropping everything\u201d in that situation is pretty reasonable and isn\u2019t comparable to a standard Christmas trip to the in laws", "Alright I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t gonna comment on this thread but this comment set me off. Tf you mean CONVENIENTLY the friends\u2019 father DIED. you really think OP is thinking, wow I didn\u2019t want to spend christmas with my wife\u2019s family but thankfully I can get out of it bc my friend is going through terrible tragedy, how convenient! JFC what happened to empathy?? if that\u2019s how the wife is thinking of this situation then what a cold person she is.", "It was a mutual decision. If the wife has a problem with it, they can split the holiday and spend time with both. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault that this tragedy happened when it was the wife\u2019s year to see family.", "Yeah, I think it proves just how many toxic teenagers are in this chat who don't know any nuance in long term relationships or even life. Like boohoo you made a promise to be home by Christmas, who cares if someone died, my needs are more important /s", "Yeah, I'd take issue if my husband *didn't* make the same decision for a close friend.\n\nNTA", "He knowingly and intentionally lied to her about coming back (he admits in the comments he had zero plans to go back for christmas and just said it to placate her) and refused to let her come back with him because he didnt think she sounded sincere enough for his liking... Theres no excuse for that", "Yeah, I think this is pretty spot on.", "Him leaving the first time in ages that they\u2019ve spent the holiday with her family is a very big deal. He should have made it up to her by going there with her this year.", "He didn't decline. He communicated that he would like to spend xmas at home this year. It doesn't say she suggested going and he said no, that the in-laws invited them and he said no, it just says \"I requested.\"", "There has been no comments on whether they discussed spending Christmas out of state again this year. Again, she had Christmas with her family last year. There's nothing to make up, he didn't need to be there.", "Sorry it wasn\u2019t meant as a comment directly to you. Just someone dm me and used your comment to try to justify OP actions.", "Him choosing to lie about it to her face is absolutely something she can bring up later.", "I'm guessing the fact that he's refusing to go her family this year because that friend needs him is contributing right now.", ">If he'd told her the truth at that moment, or even \"I don't know what is going to happen,\" she would have come even more unglued.\n\nThere is absolutely zero information here to come even close to that conclusion. \n\nIf you think that whenever someone has a good friend whose parent is seriously ill they have every right to make bold faced lies to their spouse and entire family, I have no idea what to do with that.", "I wonder if this gives OP \"permission\" to spend every Christmas from now on w/ his friend, since it will always be a difficult time for his family.  \n\n\n(or if not forever- for how many years is this a valid reason to not visit her parents for Christmas, which he'd rather not do?)", "Op booked his ticket back before even telling his wife", "That\u2019s not how I meant it but that\u2019s how the wife must\u2019ve perceived it. And I didn\u2019t say he conveniently died. I said he was in the hospital in a convenient time or so in the wife\u2019s mindset. Calm down, sir.\n\nETA for clarity.", "But they aren't spending this year with her family, and he said they don't see her family very often.  He may not have been able to avoid this, and what he did is understandable, but it seems that her family isn't a huge priority for him, and I'm sure that adds up.", "It\u2019s like \u201csorry my best friend\u2019s father died at an inconvenient time for you to celebrate Christmas\u201d. \n\nImagine how best friend felt, loosing his father literally right before Christmas.", "I am with you here.  I have always felt that the way my partner treats others is indicative of how he will treat me when the chips are down.", "She might be mad about it a year later because OP is planning to also spend THIS Christmas with the same friend's family instead of hers. (stated in OP's other comments here.)", "I guess my first question would be why did she ask when he would be back? She shouldn't have been putting any pressures on him to return.\n\nMy second thought is that she should have stayed with her family, if she had left and then he wrote \"aita my wife is mad I \"forced\" her to come with me to spend time with my grieving friend and miss out on Christmas with her family\" everyone would have said \"why didn't she stay with her family?!\" ... Imagine the fights had she gone with him \"I can't believe you made me miss the holidays with my family when we only got there a couple days before we left.\"\n\nI asked my wife about this one, and she eye rolled so hard that even with his lie this guy was not the asshole. I feel the same way. But maybe that's adult relationships where you acknowledge that there are important people outside of yourselves and that sometimes things just don't work out, and sometimes people make mistakes. The lie came from him being uncomfortable to communicate to her he didn't know if/when he would make it back - he needs to work on that, realistically they both need to work on their communication.", "And I\u2019m sure he will abandon or has abandoned his wife for his friends needs around minor and major holidays. And then turns around and blames his wife for being \u201crigid and unfeeling\u201d, or some other bs.", "Fair enough. Like I said, I can understand the wife's feelings and why she is bringing it up. In her shoes I could see doing the same thing, even while rationally knowing OP did the right thing. \n\nMy best friend lost her mom a few years ago and I did everything in my power to be there as soon as I could even though it was not an ideal time, etc. \n\nThe thing is... You only lose your parent once. \n\nAs a friend, you get one shot to do right by someone going through it. \n\nI think OP should make spending time with his wife's family a priority at some point in the next year if Christmas doesn't work. \n\nIt's okay to not... Have a deep connection with your in-laws or find their company enthralling but you have to support your spouse in spending time with their family.\n\nThe question of judgement, however, is if OP was wrong to do what he did last Christmas and I stand by my verdict.", "Yeah, I'm glad OP was able to be there for him at least. And imagine the kind of narcissism it takes to be angry that your perfect little Christmas was ruined because of someone's death", "My pops died on Christmas Eve and the whole holiday now has a pall over it for me. My wife and friends being there for me was about the only thing that kept me together. The only slight grace I will give to OP\u2019s wife is that if she hasn\u2019t lost a parent there\u2019s just no way for her to understand how awful it is, you have to have it happen to get it.", "I totally agree!! I\u2019m amazed at these YTA comments.", "It\u2019s completely normal to ask your spouse when they\u2019re coming back when they are ditching you for Christmas. That\u2019s completely reasonable, not putting pressure on him.", "If he didn't make comments, i would have agreed.  But he said this year they are seeing the local family (his cause hers is out of town) like they usually do.  This was her one chance to be with her family, and it didn't happen.  He lied. He didn't talk with her first, and now isn't going back this year cause he needed to be close again.  Supporting his friend this guy is good at, being a good spouse, he is an AH.", "I mean not expecting your husband to get on a plane and come back for Christmas right after watching a close family friend die is really low bar\u2026.", "\"Ditching you for Christmas.\" Going to be a supportive, kind person.\n\nI would be shoving my partner out of the door and making sure she felt no guilt at the circumstances.\n\nTo each their own.", "Ah, well, that is the problem with AITA. People are forever leaving out important information in the post and leaving us to chase around the details. \n\nOP definitely needs to make it a priority to give his spouse time with her family or he's going to cause himself a lot of frustration and grief because his wife has every right to expect he do so. \n\nOP will be TA if he doesn't turn this behavior around, soon and reprioritize. \n\nA woman who is still complaining about your behavior still cares, OP, eventually these complaints will stop either way. On one path you start acting right and you enjoy your relationship with your wife. On the other path she gives up on you and you'll be glad you have a good friend to hang with but be lonely in your bed at night.\n\nThink hard about it!", "Reading comprehension on this site is hilarious."]}
