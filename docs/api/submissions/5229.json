It wasn't my dream way to use my PTO or spend the holidays, but it was valuable family time for my wife that we hadn't gotten in a while.\n\nTwo days after we arrived, I got a heart wrenching call from my closest friend (26m) telling me his father likely wasn't going to make it. I knew he had been in the hospital for a while, but now it looked like things were taking a turn for the worst. This is someone I've known since I was 16, whose family I'm closer to than my in-laws. This is also a person who is extremely selfless and rarely asks for anything for himself. When he asked me to come be with him, I dropped everything to make that happen. There\u2019s no limit on what I would did rhim on a good day, so in circumstances like these\u2026 coming home felt like the only option. \n\nFlights around that time aren't always easy to come by and the one I booked was fairly expensive.

Once I realized this mistake, I immediately transferred money from my account to cover it.\n\nMy wife was not happy about any of it. She begrudgingly offered to come with me, but I declined saying that most of my time would likely be spent in a hospital waiting room. I didn't want her to be at home alone during the holidays, or awkwardly standing by as I comforted Friend. I reassured her that I would be back before the 25th, and that she should continue her family time as usual.\n\nThat didn't end up happening. Friend's father passed the following day and with grief, funeral preparations, and a lack of viable flights, I didn't end up getting to come back to be with my wife and her family.

Unless you are violating a principle, you should be seeking harmony with the person you love most. I'm going to assume that's your wife. So lay down your arms, and tell her that you want to really talk about it when you're not angry and fighting and you want to know how you can soothe her heart. She may be being unfair.

She was excited to spend time with her family, so she's allowed to feel disappointed about leaving, but she prioritized being with you and offered to leave with you. \n\nIt really does come off that you mostly just saw an excuse to escape her family celebration, immediately took it, and are blithely hoping the next years ahead will be the comfy status quo for you again.
