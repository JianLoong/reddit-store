I was living with my mom & her emotional abuse became too much for me, so I decided to look for a place since I had a full time job. After sharing my living situation with my grandparents they informed me that 1 of their tenants at their apartments that they own has been looking for a roommate for the past couple months. She is the same age as me, pretty similar lifestyle & my grandparents had vouched that she was nice, so I was interested. We met up & everything went well so we agreed on moving in together. Everything seemed fine, no fights or disagreements but I did note that she seemed really cold toward me, never really engaged in conversation or even greet me back when I would. I didn\u2019t take it personally & figured she may just be introverted or not in the best mood. We just stood out of each others way & cohabited. It was not until twitter recommended her as a possible friend & I came across her profile. I briefly looked at her tweets & saw immediately that she was been tweeting about me almost daily. Her tweets consist of calling me childish, dirty, annoying & basically just insulting me as well as her asking people for a way to get me out of the apartment. Now, this was a total shock to me as she has never spoken to me about any of her concerns & I quite honestly I keep to myself & try not to make a mess of the common areas in the place. This is not to say I am perfect, but she is definitely not either & frankly, she is usually dirtier than me & only cleans when she hires someone to do it. The next month when I saw my grandparents I expressed to them how confused I was about the situation & they agreed they could not imagine her even talking like that in person. I told them how I have been feeling uncomfortable when her boyfriend stays over weekend since I know why now he acts so unfriendly to me now. They informed me that it is in the contract that if someone sleeps there for over 14 nights & they aren\u2019t on the lease they are in violation & can be evicted. I didn\u2019t know about this rule & my roommate has certainly broke that since her boyfriend  was staying almost every weekend last year, so I told them this fact.  Now, because of this information they plan to evict her next month after she has been living here for over 6 years. I feel bad for springing this conflict up suddenly just because I was mad about what she was saying about me online, but at the same time I do feel unsafe living with someone who hates me so much & tweets about how she can get rid of me on the daily. It is also her fault for violating a contact & having a guest part time live with us without even asking. Although, I do feel like just another Nepo baby that\u2019s getting their way & guilty for maybe not bringing up the situation to her directly & in order to possibly find a solution before going straight to eviction.", "created_utc": 1677744727, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fx6tl/aita_for_getting_my_roommate_kicked_out/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if she were the nicest person on earth, she's still violating the lease.  \n\nWere you supposed to lie to your grandparents or edit your story about what's making you uncomfortable about living there to benefit someone who is both violating the lease and slamming you online behind your back day after day?

BTW, your roommate is an idiot to express her opinions - **on social media** \\- about a roommate  who is also related to the landlord. She bit herself in the ass.  \n\nAlso, that 14-days is generally considered continuous - not weekends. She may not be able to evict because of this. Does roommates BF have a key? If so, then maybe that is actionable. However, depending on city/county laws, you can also do a no-fault eviction. Better yet, just have your grandparents sever with a 60-day notice to quit (most counties/cities require 60-days for no-fault evictions). I'm telling you all this because it could become messy. All they have to say is that they are going to renovate the place (you will move in with them if she asks). Then change their minds about the renovation (costs were higher than expected). BTW, I'm not a lawyer. But I am a landlord with multiple properties (and just went through an eviction process with a tenant who didn't pay rent for nearly a year). So, this is sound advice.", "NTA.

NTA", "Thank you for your advice, I greatly appreciate your insight! As of right now I make enough to pay her half of the rent so that\u2019s not a problem & the landlords planned to give her a 60 day notice so I think your idea of renovation as the excuse may serve the best, because we weren\u2019t sure if we had to have solid proof he has living here part time (the only thing we have besides my word is the ring camera footage). So yes, I will bring passing your advice on, thank you again!"]}
