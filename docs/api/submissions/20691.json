Sadly very few are aware of this storied and historical way for a man to honor another, but as a tradition in the west it dates back to Roman times and may very well be as old a tradition or older in Japan.\n\nYour devotion does you credit.", "NTA\n\nI wish there were more heartwarming post like this here. Be happy with your new family and ignore the haters are upset at your happiness.", "Definitely NTA. Your parents didn't care about you, all they cared about is their business trips and getting drunk on wine. Your sensei genuinely cared about you more than your parents ever did. It's better to be around people that care about you than those that don't.", "NTA. If he treated you more like his own child than your own parents did and he was happy to allow you to join his family then you have every right to do what you feel is best for you.

Congrats; I'm happy for you and your newfound family.", "You\u2019re  NTA for doing this, at the end of the day, this is just your choice, and some people may beg to differ but it really is YOUR CHOICE.

But I am glad you are happy.", "YTA. You changed your name to disown your parents and you\u2019re surprised that they disowned you back? Maybe they deserved it, maybe they didn\u2019t, but either way you got the entirely predictable consequence of your actions.", "It\u2019s your name. Who better to choose it? NTA.", "NTA :')", "NTA. Your family might have paid for your classes but paying for things isn't the only role of a parent. They are to guide you, nurture you, provide you emotional support, and teach you about life, amongst other things.\n\n They seem to have done very little of what parents are supposed to do. And your sensei seems to have done more for you and had a measurable and meaningful effect on your life. I don't blame you one bit for changing your name. It comes with consequences but sometimes the consequences are worth. It sounds like you finally feel like you belong. Frankly, we all need that feeling. \n\nBest of luck.", "You can't fire me, I quit!", "That's right, he did a lot more for me than i ever expected from him.", "Thanks", "I changed my name to honor my sensei and to carry on his legacy", "You realize that all that time spent with sensei, your parents paid for, right?    \n\nNot asking you to change anything you\u2019ve done, and clearly you\u2019re not close to them.   \n\nBut have you considered that you have this treasured relationship because your parents funded the experience?   \nYour father, specifically, since he was the one working.", "This is why you\u2019re TA. Because you won\u2019t even own what you did. You want to honour your sensei? Buy him a \u201cworld\u2019s best sensei\u201d mug. He wants to see his legacy carry on? He\u2019s already got kids. Changing your name is discarding your birth family. Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t understand that.", "Which is the honor that formerly belonged to your parents so you disowned them.", "This is a bad take. Are you implying that simply giving birth to a child is enough to gain the child\u2019s respect and admiration? It\u2019s pretty clear that they weren\u2019t emotionally available for their own children to the point where they want to change their name and honor who the see as a real parental figure. Children are not responsible for the shortcomings of their birth parents.", "Just because they are parents do not mean they deserve the honor; clearly they have done a lot to lose OP\u2019s trust and faith, and therefore don\u2019t deserve any respect from OP. OP, you NTA.", "Not at all. If OP had come in with \u201cMy birth parents suck so I disowned them, AITA?\u201d It would be a very difference question. Instead, here he is all surprised_pikachu_face.gif and denying that\u2019s ever what he intended to do. He seems to be after validation that his parents are behaving unreasonably by being upset after he deliberately upset them.", "I wasn't passing any judgments, simply stating facts.\n\nParents get than honor by default. Removing that honor is the same as disowning them therefore OP disowned his parents and they disowned him back.", "NTA\n\nBut idk why you\u2019d be surprised that your parents were upset; technically you did disown them first by changing your name.\n\nWhich is fine, because it sounds like your sensei was more important in your life anyway. Congrats on the new family \ud83d\udc4d\n\nWe don\u2019t get to choose who we\u2019re born to, but we *do* get to choose who we embrace as our loved ones.", "As a Japanese woman who is also a black belt in karate, I find this to be heartwarming and a wonderful way to honor the man who helped raise you.", "NTA, and i am so happy for you", "NTA. It sounds like your sensei acted more like a family member than your parents. It makes sense that you would want to make it official.", "NTA. If it has significance to you, it has significance to you. I do find it a tad odd that you teacher didn't give you a lecture about honoring your parents/family, etc, etc, but by no means could anyone be deemed an asshole for changing their last name...", "I was going to add! Is this just a last name change or is OP now in the Sensei's Koseki Tohon or like a formal adoption? \n\n... I might be over thinking this also.\n\nBut NTA. I'm glad OP's happy."]}
