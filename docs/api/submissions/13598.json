I am not OK with this.", "selftext": "We have been happily married for 7 years, with a 4 year old daughter. We rarely have disagreements, much less major arguments. \n\nShe was born and raised in China, moved to the US in 2011, naturalized, and has no intention or desire to return. Her family, including her parents, live in China. She is currently a stay at home mom.\n\nI was born in Japan but was raised in the US. I am the family breadwinner and handle all our finances, etc. \n\nWhen our daughter was born, my wife's parents stayed with us for a whole year. I had apprehension about this. But we had a new baby, my wife was still working, and I didn't want them to feel unappreciated. They are objectively not bad people. They love our daughter and were helpful in supporting my wife. But there is a huge cultural and language divide that I'm not sure can be overcome. I realize it's normal in many other cultures for the inlaws/parents to basically live with the family and grandchildren. But this certainly wasn't the case with me. \n\nMy in-laws have been to the US all of 3 times. They don't speak English. They are not really aware of Western social boundaries and norms. They are of also the age where they aren't really interested in learning these norms. We live in an outer suburb that is not accessible by any other way than private vehicle, so they are essentially housebound the entire time they are here. \n\nWhen they came to stay with us the first time, I was initially happy to have them. But after a few months, that happiness started to turn into near resentment. We had no privacy. They had behaviors that to them were maybe normal/innocent, but I found bothersome/disrespectful. Due to language, I was unable to directly communicate and ask them to change their behavior. The same coming from my wife was not effective due to cultural norms and, \"We're your parents, we raised you, so you don't really get to tell us what to do.\" \n\nThis placed an emotional and relational divide between me and my wife. I was also the \"FNG\" at work and working harder and longer than I am now. I started to dread going home. I stayed at work long after my shifts had finished. It was the only way I could get away to have time for myself. I became more withdrawn, and it was obvious. I felt trapped. I genuinely feared for our marriage at one point.\n\nFast forward 4 years later. She wants to invite them over so they can spend time with our daughter. I am not opposed to this. She wants them to come for 6 months. I would be ok with maybe 2 or 3. She keeps coming up with reasons why it has to be 6. I am simply not OK with this, especially how it affected our relationship last time. I also don't want our daughter to see me like I was 4 years ago. Once again I feel like what I think doesn't matter. And if I don't go along, then it's because I don't like my inlaws, or I don't want them to spend time with our daughter. Neither of which are the case. \n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1680218223, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1272o6q/aita_wife_wants_to_invite_her_parents_to_stay/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We converted the basement to an apartment, and my wife's parents moved in. \n\nAgain, they're great people. They paid their share, even helped with a little bit of the upkeep. but soon, they began to feel a sense of ownership over my house which caused friction. My father in law is a packrat, never thrown anything away. My yard started looking like a salvage yard. There were other things like that that kind of piled up. \n\nBut the biggest problem, the one thing that nearly cracked me... They were just always fucking there. Always. Privacy was a distant memory. We took to spending all our time in our bedroom, moved our tv, computers, everything up there, and it still wasn't enough. Even though they had their own space, they thought nothing of coming upstairs and pounding on our door at all hours. And sex? Ha! What's that? We were already having to dance around 4 kids. no way we were getting jiggy with her parents on standby. \n\nThey were just always there....\n\nMy recommendation for a happy relationship with your in-laws is keep them slightly further than walking distance away. Make it so at least a little effort is required for them to impose upon you. \n\nSomeway somehow you're going to have to convince your wife this doesn't work for you.

Six months is just entirely TOO long to be cooped up in a house with your in-laws if there *weren't* a massive language barrier. The culture clash will be inevitable.

My parents indulged them in this to a degree but they also would nudge them out of their comfort zone by doing such things as taking them hiking in the woods or wine tasting or up to the mountains to see snow. The visitors seemed to enjoy these trips but they also seemed to feel a need to more on sooner, probably to decompress and process after their unusual experiences.
