I am not OK with this.", "selftext": "We have been happily married for 7 years, with a 4 year old daughter. We rarely have disagreements, much less major arguments. \n\nShe was born and raised in China, moved to the US in 2011, naturalized, and has no intention or desire to return. Her family, including her parents, live in China. She is currently a stay at home mom.\n\nI was born in Japan but was raised in the US. I am the family breadwinner and handle all our finances, etc. \n\nWhen our daughter was born, my wife's parents stayed with us for a whole year. I had apprehension about this. But we had a new baby, my wife was still working, and I didn't want them to feel unappreciated. They are objectively not bad people. They love our daughter and were helpful in supporting my wife. But there is a huge cultural and language divide that I'm not sure can be overcome. I realize it's normal in many other cultures for the inlaws/parents to basically live with the family and grandchildren. But this certainly wasn't the case with me. \n\nMy in-laws have been to the US all of 3 times. They don't speak English. They are not really aware of Western social boundaries and norms. They are of also the age where they aren't really interested in learning these norms. We live in an outer suburb that is not accessible by any other way than private vehicle, so they are essentially housebound the entire time they are here. \n\nWhen they came to stay with us the first time, I was initially happy to have them. But after a few months, that happiness started to turn into near resentment. We had no privacy. They had behaviors that to them were maybe normal/innocent, but I found bothersome/disrespectful. Due to language, I was unable to directly communicate and ask them to change their behavior. The same coming from my wife was not effective due to cultural norms and, \"We're your parents, we raised you, so you don't really get to tell us what to do.\" \n\nThis placed an emotional and relational divide between me and my wife. I was also the \"FNG\" at work and working harder and longer than I am now. I started to dread going home. I stayed at work long after my shifts had finished. It was the only way I could get away to have time for myself. I became more withdrawn, and it was obvious. I felt trapped. I genuinely feared for our marriage at one point.\n\nFast forward 4 years later. She wants to invite them over so they can spend time with our daughter. I am not opposed to this. She wants them to come for 6 months. I would be ok with maybe 2 or 3. She keeps coming up with reasons why it has to be 6. I am simply not OK with this, especially how it affected our relationship last time. I also don't want our daughter to see me like I was 4 years ago. Once again I feel like what I think doesn't matter. And if I don't go along, then it's because I don't like my inlaws, or I don't want them to spend time with our daughter. Neither of which are the case. \n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1680218223, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1272o6q/aita_wife_wants_to_invite_her_parents_to_stay/", "score": 580, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You both need a frank and honest discussion. \n\nIf you have a therapist or a mediator or can just chat after your child has gone to bed, it would be a good idea to lay it all out as you did here. \n\nYou can tell her all the reasons why not. If she values your marriage, she will listen and you can come up with a plan on how to manage for 2 months without destroying your marriage or feeling the way you felt before. \n\nMake sure return tickets are booked Op! \n\nGood luck!", "NTA.  I'd wager that she's pushing the 6 months because she's already arranged it with them. This is your home too, your life and wellbeing too.  Considering your experience before, I think 2-3 months is outrageously generous.  Nothing can tank a relationship faster than this, I think.", "NTA - but do you realise if she agrees to a month or 2 they won\u2019t actually go home then ?", "Six months is very long visit. It sounds like she\u2019s just trying to work up to telling you they\u2019re staying for good. NTA", "Agreed.  Maybe she's already told them they can move in with them. She tells OP is only for 6 months and will find reasons why the stay should  be extended. How long can someone from China stay on a tourist visa?", "I don't think that will work. They will pull the \"we're elders, what we say goes\" thing. He is also considered an outsider, and their daughter is not, so they'd ignore him and retreat to her. Like a kid shopping for a parent to say yes.\n\n That the OP appears Asian also undermines this plan, because they'll expect him to know and defer to the filial piety stuff, whereas if he was bluntly Caucasian, they'd just think he was a rude American and be polite-ish to his face while doing what they wanted behind his back. China and Japan have definite beef, so I'm thinking they'd mutter curse words at him and do what they wanted to his face.", "Here's some context from someone with a Chinese background. \n\nIt's 6 months because that's the maximum that they **can** stay in the US on a tourist visa. They're not gonna break that up into multiple trips because its more expensive having to buy tickets twice.", "Yeah, I thought there were visa limits of three months - but maybe as they are family of a US citizen, that changes things?\n\nI dunno?", "I'm glad you escaped that bs.", "That was my thought too\u2026", "Initial admission on a tourist visa is up to six months. However they might have applied for an extension of stay granting them another six months.", "That video was depressing and makes it very clear that children are considered an investment and a retirement plan.\n\nOP and his wife should book sessions with a marital counsellor to facilitate the discussion before any trip is booked. Otherwise he will end up with either a divorce or stuck with his in-laws for the rest of their lives.", "180 days in a row is the limit of a 10 year U.S. tourist visa. Although multiple entries allow for the clock to start back at day 1 with each new entry.", "And the older you get the more strenuous long distance travels are. So I see the point here, but they certainly waited too long. 7 years for another trip? I'd probably offer to fly them out every 2 years for 2 months or something of that nature.", "That was my first thought.  But I\u2019m familiar with visa restrictions and exorbitant airfare - my brother and his wife swapped countries half a planet away every six months for a couple years before they got married. \n\nMaybe most of the forum doesn\u2019t deal with visa travel plus ridiculous airfare?  Guangzhou flight to my city is $2100.  Not like hopping a flight to Chicago.", "OP having signed a contract 7 years ago, including a \"7 years from now, thou shall let your wife's parents stay with you semiyearly!\" clause.\n\nEither that or them paying him $1M a month. \n\nBut simply expecting this as a husband's duty is bs.

But I was told that's why there are so many Chinese baby girls in America that are adopted was because they were only allowed to have one child and they chose to keep males because the male had to take care of the parents when they're elderly.", "And op is American and is doing the same?", "I\u2019m totally not an expert on China on any means, but my extremely limited understanding is that the one child policy means that a lot of parents need to rely on their daughters because they never had a son. That\u2019s obviously something that would change now, with the one child policy being repealed, but that does nothing for the families who raised only a daughter.\n\nI\u2019m fully prepared to be wrong though. I recognize my own limitations here.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing there! But it\u2019s why I\u2019m surprised that the wife\u2019s parent\u2019s retirement plan hasn\u2019t already been raised. \n\nI\u2019m in no way qualified as an expert on China, but my extremely limited understanding suggests that OP and his wife might be talking past each other.", "Ah I see. I assume because she knows he'll have a problem with it and is trying to create a situation where one day he'll wake up and be trapped in this new reality. \n\nThe only thing to do would be either to accept it or divorce and she either believes he would never do that, or at least believes she could still force him into financing the situation even if he did.", "There\u2019s a real risk there. I could also see the wife just assuming that OP intuitively understands that her parents will need to live with them and totally botching the communication of the cultural gap here.", "Also a possibility. It's been mentioned in other comments that the fact that op is of an Asian ethnicity could be contributing to why they all seem so comfortable stapping all over him. Maybe she just figures it doesn't need to be explained and is unsure where the pushback is coming from.

This son needed to marry so his wife would take care of his parents' daily needs, though.\n\nThis legislation, coupled with the only child law, led to many tragedies.\nSome couples were ostracized/expelled from their families and could only come back if/when they had a male child.
