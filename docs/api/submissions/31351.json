I also have a scam notification built into my caller ID, so I don't really get cold calls. \n\nOP is just so hostile that I had a hard time with the whole demonizing call centers and wanted to let them know that the term isn't as negative as it was 10 years ago. They're very high on the morality horse to be throwing around inaccurate terminology.", "Yes, I'm familiar with how scams work.  I did read OP's description, and I don't think they're a reliable narrator.  They obviously hate DIL. If you hate someone,  you can very easily turn things negative.  I can see the scam job actually being a company that sells anti-virus software, and maybe they got bought out,  not closed.  \n\nMorality is subjective.  I can hate the job and not hate the person doing it,  especially in this economy.  OP talks about how DIL won't get another job. Maybe going from $25/hr plus bonuses and 9-5 down to 13/hr at a fast food place with all over the place hours isn't doable for them.  Maybe DIL is a naive goose. Maybe DIL is in it for the $$$ and doesn't care how she gets it.  Who are we to judge? It's not like DIL is going to be explaining the fine points of capitalistic grey areas or identity theft to toddlers.\n\nOP is entitled to do as they see fit.  They are just so hyper focused on their version of morality that I don't know that they can see past their own judgemental mindset.", "So I have trouble believing OP is a reliable narrator with their comments and post language.  The inaccuracy of assuming a call center means scam added to the absolute disdain she has for everyone that's not her sick daughter is really surprising. \n\nInstead of call center, she could have said scam company.  She could have included the actual details in the post instead of talking about how much she hates the DIL for working in a call center.\n\nGiven the vehemence of the post added to the new account, it really makes me wonder about why OP didn't start with her actual problems with the DIL vs. The disdain for the call center. Just my two cents.\n\nIf the DIL legitimately works for a scam company,  OP is N T A. I'm having trouble separating the moral superiority from the active hatred.\n\nETA: if you'd read my first post all the way through,  you'd see that I'd read OPs description of the scam job.", "But when I read her description of the scam, I can also see how someone who hates a person can turn an innocent anti-virus sales job into a horrible scam.  And as to being shut down,  is she sure they didn't get bought out?\n\nLook,  if OPs accounts are the true nature of the job,  then she's totally N T A. Morality is a subjective thing,  and everyone is entitled to their own views. My interpretation of OPs post and comments shows me that they're really really concerned with the judgment of the morality of other people. There's a person that loves OPs grandkids who wants to spend time with them and love them,  not share the evil ways of capitalistic grey areas. I can still love the person while not supporting what they do.  I don't have to automatically hate people for the jobs they do,  especially in this economy.\n\nETA- I did read her description of the job before my first post.

I did apologize to them as well. \n\nAnd you're right that 'stealing bank info' doesn't leave much room for doubt, it's just in my experience there are people who are judgemental towards those who work in call centers so I made an assumption and then made an ass of myself.", "I just saw that OP wrote that and apologized to them.

Same goes for the reason her Bio daughter lost custody. It all makes the story SUCH a slam dunk that if she had posted them from the get-go, they would be tremendously helpful.  Almost like she didn\u2019t KNOW those details at the time because they are crafted or at least slanted to fit the narrative she wants to present.\n\nListen,  only OP knows the specifics of her situation.
