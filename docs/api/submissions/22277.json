A little background before I get into it. I am a stay at home mom and he works full time (hours are normally 12 hours a day M-F and 6-8 hours on Saturday). This is both of ours first time being a parent so we are figuring it out as we go basically. Last week he expressed to me that he doesn\u2019t feel like he helps enough and to his surprise I agreed. \n\nI knew getting into our relationship that I would be a stay at home mom. His mom was one and he loved it. Not to mention his working hours so I knew that it would be hard just not this hard. Basically I take the baby all day and night since he works. He only takes the baby for about 20 minutes to an hour when he gets home and he helps clean the babies bottles every other day. Sometimes on his day off he will take the baby so I can sleep in for two hours. But that\u2019s all the help I get. I told him during this arrangement that he doesn\u2019t give me a break. Plain and simple. He got defensive about how he\u2019s the one who has the financial burden and I agree it can\u2019t be a good feeling wondering if you can feed your family. But he makes a good 9k every 2 weeks so it\u2019s not like we are drowning. Anyways, he asked me why I didn\u2019t think he was helping and I told him that I do the cooking, cleaning, laundry, most of the bottles, bath time, overnights, and during the day. I get a 20 min to an hour break when I\u2019m eating supper after he\u2019s done with his meal. He claimed that he can\u2019t hear the baby crying at night which I think is crazy because the baby screams bloody murder most of the time. So I told him that was bs since he wakes up on the ring of his alarm. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong here. I get what I said probably hurt his feelings but he doesn\u2019t help. He told if I feel that way then I need to ask for help. I told him I shouldn\u2019t have to ask for him to help with his baby. If the baby is hungry he should be able to feed it. If the diaper needs changed he should be able to change it etc.", "created_utc": 1689397043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1502gy8/aita_for_agreeing_with_my_boyfriend_when_he_said/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You bf works A LOT, I'd be worried not because he's not helping you but because he's missing out on the baby development, on building a close bond with him. But in order to do so and a avoid just being a Sunday dad, he needs to work less.\nConsider doing some work from home yourself to set up a healthier work life balance for the family", "Might be an unpopular opinion but NAH I think alot of people (mainly men) assume stay at home moms and working husbands mean that mom takes care of the baby all day even when hubby is home. Which is unfair, however I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to discount the hardship of having a job even if the job makes a bunch of money. And Idk how the conversation went down but him saying he feels like he doesn\u2019t do much\u2026he probably meant it but might\u2019ve just wanted you to listen before saying anything. And while you might not think you needed to ask and he should\u2019ve just done it, might be true in some cases it might not be true for him because if he was raised with a stay at home mom and his experience was probably what he\u2019s doing with you and your kid now because he views it as normal. I think there definitely needs to be a conversation of how he could help more, because you definitely need a longer break. Overall I guess I don\u2019t think either one is an AH you both just might have different expectations that seem normal to one person but not the other.", "NTA, but take some of that $18k/month and hire help. \n\nAlso, the unmarried SAHP path can be risky if things don\u2019t work out.", "NAH.\n\nI am in almost the exact same situation, however I see it differently than you.\n\nI consider my husband working as parenting.\n\nHe has also lamented about feeling like he\u2019s not doing enough to help, but he DOES help SO MUCH.\n\nHe keeps this roof over our heads, the fridge stocked, the baby necessities stocked, sacrifices his body and safety (hazardous job) to make sure we have a comfortable life, etc and even more than that.\n\nEverything is provided for.\n\nHe also works crazy hours like your bf, my husband gets maybe 2 hours before having to go to bed to get proper sleep for his job.\n\nYes, both parents need to get good sleep.\nBoth of our jobs are important.\n\nIt was hard to \u201cnap when the baby naps\u201d, but at a certain point I stopped freaking out if my son was breathing or not and I was able to. My husband understood that I needed those naps, and so he doesn\u2019t get on me about if a chore isn\u2019t done or dinner is late (he never did before but still lol).\n\nThere have been a couple nights where I knew I needed help, so I woke up my husband and he took over and got the baby back to sleep.\n\nI communicated that I needed it, and he accepted, as I\u2019m sure your bf would if you asked.\n\nBut there needs to be communication.\nI obviously don\u2019t know your relationship or what you\u2019ve already talked about, so I apologize if you have already.\n\nYou are both new to this, and that\u2019s ok.\n\nEven if you were both able to communicate properly before, it all changes once you have a baby.\nYou have to relearn each other.\n\nYou\u2019re both going to want validation (what I believe he wanted), assurance, you\u2019re going to argue about what\u2019s best for your baby, you\u2019re going to tell him to hold the baby\u2019s head this way instead of that and he may get defensive and vice versa, because you both want to be good parents and want the other to believe that baby is safe with you.\n\nSo relearn each other.\n\nNavigate this great new experience together, and grow together, all three of you.\n\nBoth of you are contributing into growing a whole separate human being, in some ways similar, and others not.

His first word. I got to experience that, all of that.\n\nYour bf won\u2019t get to see most of those moments and experience the slow but sure growth of your child the way you get to.\n\nIt\u2019s hard in the beginning, but it gets easier.\n\nAsk for help from any and all resources around you.\n\nGive yourself some grace and, hopefully if this resonates with you, give some to your bf too.", "NAH\n\nIf I'm reading this correctly, your partner works a 66-68 hour week. This is a pretty long working week, especially if he has a commute! I expect he spends his day off recovering and feeling like a zombie.\n\nA baby is a lot to manage, and needing a bit of help is normal - this is why humans live and reproduce in pairs, and usually as part of a larger social structure. However, I'm afraid you're unlikely to get much more help from your partner - he is already overworked and giving all he's got. I'm impressed he's still functioning and not completely burnt out.\n\nI believe you should consider the following options:\n1) You get a job, allowing him to cut down his working hours and either split childcare so that while one is working, the other is looking after Baby OR use paid childcare while you are both working\n2) You get help from someone else - family or a hired \"nanny\" (there may be a more up-to-date term, I'm not sure)\n\nAlso bear in mind that parenting doesn't come naturally to everyone. Yes, you know the baby is crying because they need a feed, but does he know that? Does he actually just need to be told \"Hey, I think Baby needs a feed. Can you?\" It's become routine for you, but he's had less time to learn and get used to what he's meant to do, because he already has a full time job occupying his time and mind.\n\nRegarding the conversation you had, still NAH. He was looking for reassurance because he's giving all he's got and worried that it's not enough, and you confirmed that it's not enough. And now everyone's upset. BUT you guys aren't in it alone. Please consider reaching out to others for help. You do sound like you really care for each other, just being first-time parents is tough, and trying to do it by yourselves is even tougher.", "Since you\u2019re both figuring it out as you go then you\u2019re both going to have to figure out how to help each other.

Taking care of a single baby isn't all that difficult.  They sleep a lot, drink formula, and hang around in a playpen a lot. It is a job you can do in your pyjamas.
