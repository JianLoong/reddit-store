{"id": 22277, "submission_id": "1502gy8", "title": "AITA for agreeing with my boyfriend when he said he didn\u2019t help enough with our baby?", "selftext": "I (24F) and my boyfriend (25m) recently had a baby together. A little background before I get into it. I am a stay at home mom and he works full time (hours are normally 12 hours a day M-F and 6-8 hours on Saturday). This is both of ours first time being a parent so we are figuring it out as we go basically. Last week he expressed to me that he doesn\u2019t feel like he helps enough and to his surprise I agreed. \n\nI knew getting into our relationship that I would be a stay at home mom. His mom was one and he loved it. Not to mention his working hours so I knew that it would be hard just not this hard. Basically I take the baby all day and night since he works. He only takes the baby for about 20 minutes to an hour when he gets home and he helps clean the babies bottles every other day. Sometimes on his day off he will take the baby so I can sleep in for two hours. But that\u2019s all the help I get. I told him during this arrangement that he doesn\u2019t give me a break. Plain and simple. He got defensive about how he\u2019s the one who has the financial burden and I agree it can\u2019t be a good feeling wondering if you can feed your family. But he makes a good 9k every 2 weeks so it\u2019s not like we are drowning. Anyways, he asked me why I didn\u2019t think he was helping and I told him that I do the cooking, cleaning, laundry, most of the bottles, bath time, overnights, and during the day. I get a 20 min to an hour break when I\u2019m eating supper after he\u2019s done with his meal. He claimed that he can\u2019t hear the baby crying at night which I think is crazy because the baby screams bloody murder most of the time. So I told him that was bs since he wakes up on the ring of his alarm. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong here. I get what I said probably hurt his feelings but he doesn\u2019t help. He told if I feel that way then I need to ask for help. I told him I shouldn\u2019t have to ask for him to help with his baby. If the baby is hungry he should be able to feed it. If the diaper needs changed he should be able to change it etc.\n\nEdit: I would like to thank everyone for commenting but I would also like to address a few things \n\n1- my boyfriend is blue collar so me going back to work wouldn\u2019t magically mean he works less it just means we would both have crazy hours since my prior job required me to be on call a lot and some stranger would be raising our son. He also loves his job and if he had the option I don\u2019t think he\u2019s cut down on hours anyways \n\n2- some of you were concerned with my age and not being able to support myself if things go bad. Prior to having my son I was a social worker so I could always go back.\n\n3- I wouldn\u2019t consider us rich by any means but I thinks that\u2019s mainly because 8k of his monthly income goes back into his work supplies. (Oxygen and acetylene tanks, rods, FR clothing, ect) \n\n4- I have thought about getting his opinion on hiring help, but I do have trust issues due to my prior work experience and even some personal experience with child abuse, neglect, things like that. So that\u2019s on me for sure \n\n5- I never meant to make him feel like a dead beat. I know he loves our son with everything in him it\u2019s just the lack of help. I do agree I could have worded things better though. \n\n6- I do not sit all day and just watch my baby sleep that\u2019s for sure. He does get hot meals when he comes home and I do pack his lunch for him since I know if he did it himself he\u2019d make pb&js lol", "created_utc": 1689397043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1502gy8/aita_for_agreeing_with_my_boyfriend_when_he_said/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And Idk how the conversation went down but him saying he feels like he doesn\u2019t do much\u2026he probably meant it but might\u2019ve just wanted you to listen before saying anything. And while you might not think you needed to ask and he should\u2019ve just done it, might be true in some cases it might not be true for him because if he was raised with a stay at home mom and his experience was probably what he\u2019s doing with you and your kid now because he views it as normal.

This is a pretty long working week, especially if he has a commute! I expect he spends his day off recovering and feeling like a zombie.\n\nA baby is a lot to manage, and needing a bit of help is normal - this is why humans live and reproduce in pairs, and usually as part of a larger social structure. However, I'm afraid you're unlikely to get much more help from your partner - he is already overworked and giving all he's got. I'm impressed he's still functioning and not completely burnt out.\n\nI believe you should consider the following options:\n1) You get a job, allowing him to cut down his working hours and either split childcare so that while one is working, the other is looking after Baby OR use paid childcare while you are both working\n2) You get help from someone else - family or a hired \"nanny\" (there may be a more up-to-date term, I'm not sure)\n\nAlso bear in mind that parenting doesn't come naturally to everyone. Yes, you know the baby is crying because they need a feed, but does he know that? Does he actually just need to be told \"Hey, I think Baby needs a feed. Can you?\" It's become routine for you, but he's had less time to learn and get used to what he's meant to do, because he already has a full time job occupying his time and mind.\n\nRegarding the conversation you had, still NAH. He was looking for reassurance because he's giving all he's got and worried that it's not enough, and you confirmed that it's not enough. And now everyone's upset. BUT you guys aren't in it alone.

When my husband does 12 hour shifts, I barely get to see him and he is exhausted. Your husband has one day off from work a week, of which he gives you two hours away from the baby. I don't see any mention of him getting time off on Sundays. I was a SAHP too. I took all the nightshift feeds/nappy changes because I was able to take a nap during the day when the baby slept. Do you want him to fall asleep driving home after a 12 hour shift because that is what will happen. Being a SAHP is hard work but your concept of \"fair\" is unreasonable. If you want him to work less hours, draw up a budget and discuss this. Another option is to hire some help with cleaning or have childcare once a week so you can run errands. Maybe you need to discuss returning to work and putting bubs into child care or getting a nanny. But your husband isn't out having fun while you stay home. He is also working.", "YTA this would have been n ah but you don\u2019t want to hire child care. Sorry you can\u2019t have it both ways your bf is working like crazy to support you all and you want to be a sahm that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t go off at him because you need more help and you want it from him. Let me tell you as someone who worked crazy hours when his son was born all he is thinking is is baby/gf ok are we ok if we need the dr or hospital he isn\u2019t killing himself working because he wants to but because he thinks he needs to.", "Yea , your boyfriend works a lot. Being an SAHM requires you to do most of the work regarding care and housework. When exactly do you expect him to give you \"breaks\" if he works 12 hours a day? It sounds like he does what he can to help. You even said you knew you would be staying at home,  so why are you complaining about doing it?  This is what it is like having a baby. Plain and simple. YTA.", "NTA.\n\nThere\u2019s no need for hours that long. If he works less he will have less work expenses too so will bring home the same amount. \n\nYou\u2019re currently working 24/7 and there\u2019s not a lot you can do about that, except for hiring some help/getting family involved.", "> Last week he expressed to me that he doesn\u2019t feel like he helps enough and to his surprise I agreed. \n\n\nTo his suprise? He wanted to tell him his feeling is wrong? To assure him it's okay and to quell his conscious? That's kinda manipulative. \n\nInstead of continue to talk about he can be more involved so it won't be a problem, for either of you, he got defensive that you agreed with him? \nHmm. NTA", "I think you are crying wolf and being the victim when you're absolutely not. The man literally works 12 hour days, that's 60 hours in 5 days, and 6-8 hours on Saturdays. So that's between 66-68 hours a damn week. I'm sorry, but you are in a committed relationship, maybe you should put on your communication skills and say, hey babe, the baby's hungry, would you please help me feed him? Hey babe, I know you are so tired after work, but would you mind at least having an hour or two with him while I sleep? I'm sorry but you literally invalidate his job all over this post and make it seem like it's just an easy enough job that anyone can do. You literally described his job as being difficult and not one where he just sits in a cozy office shooting the shit all day. He's literally providing you with a roof over your head, the ability to never have to worry about bills being paid, and supplies for your child. Not saying being a mom is not difficult by any means, but by this post, you make it seem like your job is much more difficult than his. Yes, you do the cooking, cleaning, feeding the child, bathing the child, entertaining the child, and just overall being there at a moment's notice when the baby screams \"bloody murder.\" You have your job, he has his job, how about you reassure him that hey I would love more help, let's talk about what you would be able to do and for how long, and oh by the way, I'm grateful that you provide for me and our baby. I know your job is not just a walk in the park, so thank you. You made him feel weak, small, and terrible and you owe him a massive apology.

YTA", "NTA Your partner is working long shifts, but you are working even longer ones. I know people are saying that you get breaks while baby is asleep but you don\u2019t because you\u2019re doing everything else around the house as well.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want to hire childcare help but could you hire cleaning help? Some kind of service once or twice a week and you stay out of the way with baby? Then there\u2019s less strain on you and you can actually get better breaks while baby sleeps.\n\nOther than that, I think that while parents are home, the childcare should be split 50/50. You both work during the day and then you need to split the remaining work when you\u2019re both at home. Special allowance could be made for him considering the insane hours and blue collar labour, so it looks closer to 60/40. But 20 minutes a day and 2 hours on a weekend is NOWHERE near enough time with his own child, you and your breaks aside. He needs to reevaluate and rework his schedule.", "NTA. I bet if you got a job and asked him to cut down on his work he\u2019d say no because he doesn\u2019t want to parent. Going to work is easier and he knows it. I\u2019d also advise you to reconsider this arrangement. It\u2019s too unfair on you.", "NAH - I feel you so hard on how he really should just help when there's something that needs to be done. You are not his manager - it's his baby too. You shouldn't have to assign tasks for him to do. He should just step up when he sees that there's something that needs to be done and do it when he can/is able. He does work a ton. \n\nI see how you feel about outside help, what about a mother's helper? It's usually a younger teen, someone who isn't quite ready to babysit yet but loves kids or maybe babysits kids a bit older but not babies. They wouldn't be alone with the baby but they would help you out for a bit while you do things around the house. It could be a fun way to get a little company, build a relationship with a future babysitter, and get things done around the house a little easier with less stress and without triggering your childhood trauma. Just an idea.", "INFO you effectively have 1 day of quality time a week as a family. How is this going to ever work out? How do you plan to create a quality life for you all with such limitations?", "I think NAH because it\u2019s all new to both of you and he at least recognises that he doesn\u2019t do as much. And you\u2019re both exhausted. \n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable with hiring help for childcare then how about help with the household chores?  A cleaner/housekeeper for 1-2 hours a day could tidy, do the baby bottles, dishes, floors, start a load of laundry or fold a finished load, change beds, empty trash, put away a grocery delivery etc etc. Leaving you time to enjoy your baby, breathe, shower, nap, go out with the little one without the weight of household chores hanging over you. It was one of the most useful pieces of advice my sister was given before having her first.", "\"I wouldn't consider us rich by any means cause 8k goes back....\"\n\nMa'am....you still have 10k left at the end of the month.\nHe makes $120k.\nYeah he's working crazy hours to have that but.....I know many (including myself) who work as many hours and don't make half that.\n\nYes. You are pretty well off compared to most. \n\nEither way hire some help, especially if as you say, he won't back down hours anyway.\nI do think you deserve breaks.\n\nHe chooses to work that much \nYou can't choose to stop giving care to a child.\n\nOr you can, but then everyone would be horrible", "NAH.

Both are NAH as they are facing two extremely tiring situations - a very long blue collar work hours and a baby who is honestly a 24/7 job. \n\nProbably they should think of hiring a help. Also, ways in which both can afford to take breaks etc. They need to charter a plan.", "Yep. Now that they've had some time to think, maybe they can come at this as a problem to solve together. They have a few issues:\n\n* Mom overwhelmed & exhausted with no help (just assuming, I've had babies and it's exhausting no matter what)\n\n* Dad wants to (and likely should) spend more time with his kid\n\n* Dad is feeling a lot of pressure as sole earner\n\n* Everyone's working flat out and it's so bloody hard\n\nShort Term: if you're not comfortable with hiring childcare for breaks, what about housekeeping help? Believe me, I know what it's like to feel like you're barely caring for your child because you're constantly trying to keep the household from turning into a pigsty, and keep everyone fed. You can likely afford to hire help in that department to allow you to say least rest when baby rests. Or go out and do things, socialize with the baby in tow.\n\nDad: can he commit to doing more when he's around? Can you sleep in another room one night a week and let him tend the baby overnight? I guarantee if you give him a walkthrough of how it works, then put in earplugs & play white noise on the other side of the house, you will sleep like a log.\n\nDoes he need other tutorials in how to care for the baby after work? Can he commit to taking responsibility for them for 2 hours in the evening? Including bath & bed? Sometimes schedules don't allow that. But he needs to drive his own involvement - responding to the babies cries first even if he has to ask you *at first* what he needs: food, diaper, wind, cuddles? If he wants to feel more connected to his son, as well as take the pressure off his wife, he needs to actively do it. Not easy with the hours he works, I know.\n\nCan he change his work schedule? Stop working weekends?\n\nSole earner pressure: can you guys have a discussion about finances? Just cos you're a SAHM now, doesn't mean it has to be forever. He earns great money now and the baby get easier as they get older. Maybe when he's 3, he can go to preschool (great for socialisation and group childcare often has several adults on the spot, so less opportunity for abuse if that's your concern) for 15-20hrs a week, while you work on something - job hunt or education or entrepreneurial idea? Even if paid childcare is a financial loss/breaking even, it's a time investment in your future career.\n\nWould it help him feel more secure if you guys looked back at bank statements to see how your expenses are going? Do you have an emergency fund and/or other savings? Are you similar financially eg: both frugal or both spendy? Can you make a financial plan for the future together? Do you need to set up a budget plan together?\n\nDo you both want more children? How would that work?\n\nSolve it together! That's the only way a marriage works. He's having a come to Jesus moment. This whole thing is just fucking hard and it only works if you pull **together**.", "I actually feel NTA because I feel she's been bullied into being a SAHM just because her husband and his mother like that lifestyle.", "Where are you getting 90%? If he works 68 hours a week then that\u2019s between 60-70% of his waking hours for the week assuming he\u2019s up for 14-16 hours a day. Assuming he\u2019s up 14-16 hours a day then 12 hour shifts are 75-85% of his waking hours on those days. Not saying those are low numbers but it\u2019s not 90% of his waking hours.\n\nHe also gets to sleep through the night.

Not just the husband. They should hire someone to help, but OP is not ridiculous for having trouble trusting someone with her child, there are so many horror stories about children and their childcare workers. But this isn\u2019t sustainable and adjustments need to be made by both. They need to find childcare they\u2019re comfortable and the husband needs to help a little more, particularly on his days off. It\u2019s also important for him to have that bonding time with baby for the baby\u2019s sake.\nNAH yet.\n\nBut this is normal first time parent stuff, with communication and respect on both sides it can be worked through.
