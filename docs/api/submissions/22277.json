A little background before I get into it. I am a stay at home mom and he works full time (hours are normally 12 hours a day M-F and 6-8 hours on Saturday). This is both of ours first time being a parent so we are figuring it out as we go basically. Last week he expressed to me that he doesn\u2019t feel like he helps enough and to his surprise I agreed. \n\nI knew getting into our relationship that I would be a stay at home mom. His mom was one and he loved it. Not to mention his working hours so I knew that it would be hard just not this hard. Basically I take the baby all day and night since he works. He only takes the baby for about 20 minutes to an hour when he gets home and he helps clean the babies bottles every other day. Sometimes on his day off he will take the baby so I can sleep in for two hours. But that\u2019s all the help I get. I told him during this arrangement that he doesn\u2019t give me a break. Plain and simple. He got defensive about how he\u2019s the one who has the financial burden and I agree it can\u2019t be a good feeling wondering if you can feed your family. But he makes a good 9k every 2 weeks so it\u2019s not like we are drowning. Anyways, he asked me why I didn\u2019t think he was helping and I told him that I do the cooking, cleaning, laundry, most of the bottles, bath time, overnights, and during the day. I get a 20 min to an hour break when I\u2019m eating supper after he\u2019s done with his meal. He claimed that he can\u2019t hear the baby crying at night which I think is crazy because the baby screams bloody murder most of the time. So I told him that was bs since he wakes up on the ring of his alarm. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong here. I get what I said probably hurt his feelings but he doesn\u2019t help. He told if I feel that way then I need to ask for help. I told him I shouldn\u2019t have to ask for him to help with his baby. If the baby is hungry he should be able to feed it. If the diaper needs changed he should be able to change it etc.\n\nEdit: I would like to thank everyone for commenting but I would also like to address a few things \n\n1- my boyfriend is blue collar so me going back to work wouldn\u2019t magically mean he works less it just means we would both have crazy hours since my prior job required me to be on call a lot and some stranger would be raising our son. He also loves his job and if he had the option I don\u2019t think he\u2019s cut down on hours anyways \n\n2- some of you were concerned with my age and not being able to support myself if things go bad. Prior to having my son I was a social worker so I could always go back.\n\n3- I wouldn\u2019t consider us rich by any means but I thinks that\u2019s mainly because 8k of his monthly income goes back into his work supplies. (Oxygen and acetylene tanks, rods, FR clothing, ect) \n\n4- I have thought about getting his opinion on hiring help, but I do have trust issues due to my prior work experience and even some personal experience with child abuse, neglect, things like that. So that\u2019s on me for sure \n\n5- I never meant to make him feel like a dead beat. I know he loves our son with everything in him it\u2019s just the lack of help. I do agree I could have worded things better though. \n\n6- I do not sit all day and just watch my baby sleep that\u2019s for sure. He does get hot meals when he comes home and I do pack his lunch for him since I know if he did it himself he\u2019d make pb&js lol", "created_utc": 1689397043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1502gy8/aita_for_agreeing_with_my_boyfriend_when_he_said/", "score": 1481, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which is unfair, however I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to discount the hardship of having a job even if the job makes a bunch of money. And Idk how the conversation went down but him saying he feels like he doesn\u2019t do much\u2026he probably meant it but might\u2019ve just wanted you to listen before saying anything. And while you might not think you needed to ask and he should\u2019ve just done it, might be true in some cases it might not be true for him because if he was raised with a stay at home mom and his experience was probably what he\u2019s doing with you and your kid now because he views it as normal. I think there definitely needs to be a conversation of how he could help more, because you definitely need a longer break.

My husband understood that I needed those naps, and so he doesn\u2019t get on me about if a chore isn\u2019t done or dinner is late (he never did before but still lol).\n\nThere have been a couple nights where I knew I needed help, so I woke up my husband and he took over and got the baby back to sleep.\n\nI communicated that I needed it, and he accepted, as I\u2019m sure your bf would if you asked.\n\nBut there needs to be communication.\nI obviously don\u2019t know your relationship or what you\u2019ve already talked about, so I apologize if you have already.\n\nYou are both new to this, and that\u2019s ok.\n\nEven if you were both able to communicate properly before, it all changes once you have a baby.\nYou have to relearn each other.\n\nYou\u2019re both going to want validation (what I believe he wanted), assurance, you\u2019re going to argue about what\u2019s best for your baby, you\u2019re going to tell him to hold the baby\u2019s head this way instead of that and he may get defensive and vice versa, because you both want to be good parents and want the other to believe that baby is safe with you.\n\nSo relearn each other.\n\nNavigate this great new experience together, and grow together, all three of you.\n\nBoth of you are contributing into growing a whole separate human being, in some ways similar, and others not.

This is a pretty long working week, especially if he has a commute! I expect he spends his day off recovering and feeling like a zombie.\n\nA baby is a lot to manage, and needing a bit of help is normal - this is why humans live and reproduce in pairs, and usually as part of a larger social structure. However, I'm afraid you're unlikely to get much more help from your partner - he is already overworked and giving all he's got. I'm impressed he's still functioning and not completely burnt out.\n\nI believe you should consider the following options:\n1) You get a job, allowing him to cut down his working hours and either split childcare so that while one is working, the other is looking after Baby OR use paid childcare while you are both working\n2) You get help from someone else - family or a hired \"nanny\" (there may be a more up-to-date term, I'm not sure)\n\nAlso bear in mind that parenting doesn't come naturally to everyone. Yes, you know the baby is crying because they need a feed, but does he know that? Does he actually just need to be told \"Hey, I think Baby needs a feed. Can you?\" It's become routine for you, but he's had less time to learn and get used to what he's meant to do, because he already has a full time job occupying his time and mind.\n\nRegarding the conversation you had, still NAH. He was looking for reassurance because he's giving all he's got and worried that it's not enough, and you confirmed that it's not enough. And now everyone's upset. BUT you guys aren't in it alone.

Do you want him to fall asleep driving home after a 12 hour shift because that is what will happen. Being a SAHP is hard work but your concept of \"fair\" is unreasonable. If you want him to work less hours, draw up a budget and discuss this. Another option is to hire some help with cleaning or have childcare once a week so you can run errands. Maybe you need to discuss returning to work and putting bubs into child care or getting a nanny. But your husband isn't out having fun while you stay home. He is also working.", "YTA this would have been n ah but you don\u2019t want to hire child care. Sorry you can\u2019t have it both ways your bf is working like crazy to support you all and you want to be a sahm that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t go off at him because you need more help and you want it from him. Let me tell you as someone who worked crazy hours when his son was born all he is thinking is is baby/gf ok are we ok if we need the dr or hospital he isn\u2019t killing himself working because he wants to but because he thinks he needs to.", "Yea , your boyfriend works a lot. Being an SAHM requires you to do most of the work regarding care and housework. When exactly do you expect him to give you \"breaks\" if he works 12 hours a day?

He wanted to tell him his feeling is wrong? To assure him it's okay and to quell his conscious? That's kinda manipulative. \n\nInstead of continue to talk about how he can be more involved so it won't be a problem, for either of you, he got defensive that you agreed with him? \nHmm.

I'm sorry, but you are in a committed relationship, maybe you should put on your communication skills and say, hey babe, the baby's hungry, would you please help me feed him? Hey babe, I know you are so tired after work, but would you mind at least having an hour or two with him while I sleep? I'm sorry but you literally invalidate his job all over this post and make it seem like it's just an easy enough job that anyone can do. You literally described his job as being difficult and not one where he just sits in a cozy office shooting the shit all day. He's literally providing you with a roof over your head, the ability to never have to worry about bills being paid, and supplies for your child. Not saying being a mom is not difficult by any means, but by this post, you make it seem like your job is much more difficult than his. Yes, you do the cooking, cleaning, feeding the child, bathing the child, entertaining the child, and just overall being there at a moment's notice when the baby screams \"bloody murder.\" You have your job, he has his job, how about you reassure him that hey I would love more help, let's talk about what you would be able to do and for how long, and oh by the way, I'm grateful that you provide for me and our baby.

Some kind of service once or twice a week and you stay out of the way with baby? Then there\u2019s less strain on you and you can actually get better breaks while baby sleeps.\n\nOther than that, I think that while parents are home, the childcare should be split 50/50. You both work during the day and then you need to split the remaining work when you\u2019re both at home. Special allowance could be made for him considering the insane hours and blue collar labour, so it looks closer to 60/40.

He does work a ton. \n\nI see how you feel about outside help, what about a mother's helper? It's usually a younger teen, someone who isn't quite ready to babysit yet but loves kids or maybe babysits kids a bit older but not babies. They wouldn't be alone with the baby but they would help you out for a bit while you do things around the house. It could be a fun way to get a little company, build a relationship with a future babysitter, and get things done around the house a little easier with less stress and without triggering your childhood trauma.

A cleaner/housekeeper for 1-2 hours a day could tidy, do the baby bottles, dishes, floors, start a load of laundry or fold a finished load, change beds, empty trash, put away a grocery delivery etc etc. Leaving you time to enjoy your baby, breathe, shower, nap, go out with the little one without the weight of household chores hanging over you.

Believe me, I know what it's like to feel like you're barely caring for your child because you're constantly trying to keep the household from turning into a pigsty, and keep everyone fed. You can likely afford to hire help in that department to allow you to say least rest when baby rests. Or go out and do things, socialize with the baby in tow.\n\nDad: can he commit to doing more when he's around? Can you sleep in another room one night a week and let him tend the baby overnight? I guarantee if you give him a walkthrough of how it works, then put in earplugs & play white noise on the other side of the house, you will sleep like a log.\n\nDoes he need other tutorials in how to care for the baby after work? Can he commit to taking responsibility for them for 2 hours in the evening? Including bath & bed? Sometimes schedules don't allow that. But he needs to drive his own involvement - responding to the babies cries first even if he has to ask you *at first* what he needs: food, diaper, wind, cuddles? If he wants to feel more connected to his son, as well as take the pressure off his wife, he needs to actively do it. Not easy with the hours he works, I know.\n\nCan he change his work schedule? Stop working weekends?\n\nSole earner pressure: can you guys have a discussion about finances? Just cos you're a SAHM now, doesn't mean it has to be forever. He earns great money now and the baby get easier as they get older. Maybe when he's 3, he can go to preschool (great for socialisation and group childcare often has several adults on the spot, so less opportunity for abuse if that's your concern) for 15-20hrs a week, while you work on something - job hunt or education or entrepreneurial idea? Even if paid childcare is a financial loss/breaking even, it's a time investment in your future career.\n\nWould it help him feel more secure if you guys looked back at bank statements to see how your expenses are going? Do you have an emergency fund and/or other savings? Are you similar financially eg: both frugal or both spendy? Can you make a financial plan for the future together? Do you need to set up a budget plan together?\n\nDo you both want more children? How would that work?\n\nSolve it together! That's the only way a ~~marriage~~ relationship works.

If he works 68 hours a week then that\u2019s between 60-70% of his waking hours for the week assuming he\u2019s up for 14-16 hours a day. Assuming he\u2019s up 14-16 hours a day then 12 hour shifts are 75-85% of his waking hours on those days.

My husband has worked 12+ hour workdays his entire career. He has also done contract jobs that had him gone most of the week, sometimes months at at time. I've had to carry a lot of the childcare load by myself. But even with that - I've never changed a baby diaper during the first 10 days post-pardom. Because my husband took time off work to be there. He made a point of taking over childcare for me after work some days so that I could go to bed early. He let me sleep late when he had days off. He sent me out of the house to spend time with friends for at least a few hours almost **every Saturday for 9 straight years** to make sure that I had an opportunity to be someone other than Mom.

In order to save our relationship I got a daytime construction job 6am-4pm and still kept my military career. \nAfter she had healed she never bothered to look for a job. She also never bothered to look after the household or cook. After I had worked at either job I would come home and I would clean and cooked. \nShe sat around and drank pop and smoked, she did do some diapers and feeding but not much. \nWe did have someone who could help us watch our daughter for free if she wanted to work. \n\nOne day I got a phone call at work that our daughter was really sick by the individual who we trusted to watch our daughter. My ex wife was out and nowhere to be found nor answering her phone. I rushed home grabbed her and literally ran her to our doctor. He told me that I had to take her to the hospital. My ex wife met me halfway to the doctors and came with me to the hospital. She tried to give me crap. I was furious with her, and gave her crap. She knew our daughter was sick and went out anyways. \n\nYes I would feed my daughter and change her diapers when I was home and before I cooked dinner. My daughter always came first.

Sounds like you are not a deep sleeper. \nTo upset about having to do most of the housework while he\u2019s working his ass off is understandable but you chose to stay at home while you\u2019re able to find work.  Marriage is about equality, as I found out with my new wife of 17 years. \nNot saying that you\u2019re right or wrong, but my first marriage didn\u2019t last because of the similarities between our relationships. \nBest to work this issue out now and be understanding and to balance the household responsibilities. \nAs a stay home parent you will have to do more than if you worked.

Learned how to walk 3 times. My current wife did everything and made sure our son got his chemotherapy. \nNow she is going to school and working part time. I am healed and back to work.

But that\u2019s also not my problem to fix, and it\u2019s not my job to teach him or tell him what needs doing every single time.\n\nSo I told him how I wake up every single morning with a list of chores in my head that need doing. On my Saturdays and Sundays, I wake up with, \u2018The weeding needs doing so I\u2019ll do that this morning, oh the bathroom needs cleaning so I\u2019ll pencil that in for this evening, oh yeah I also need to hoover, hmm ok well when can I get to the gym?

What really helped us was a set in stone time each week where the other person takes the baby out of the house. \n\nCan you take the little one for a walk or sunday afternoon grocery shopping and a muffin or something just to give him his time to himself? And you could book in swimming lessons for tots or something like that which is his special weekly thing which gives them bonding and you time to yourself too. \n\nI appreciate your trying to give him time to actually rest because he's doing a physical job but you're cooking and cleaning and making him lunches and you are up in the night to let him sleep. You're doing enough! \n\nIt can be hard to take what you need especially when the messaging everywhere seems to be mums do everything and are happy about it and it's not work unless you ask a man to do it because it's hard for them.. but this gig is a marathon not a sprint - if it helps one of the key indicators of emotional resilience and regulation in school aged kids was maternal mental health. Looking after you and making sure you have a rest and recharge once a week is really good for everyone in the house. \n\nWhen I was getting no sleep I made a chart of mine and my partners weeks divided into 15 minute increments to make clear that I was doing more as a SAHM.. Totally normal behaviour lol. You are tired beyond belief and it can be so hard seeing someone else just living their regular life with a few cuddles and no other changes when your world has been rocked. \n\nIt gets so much easier I promise!", "Do you know that or does he say that?\n\nReally? No employers that would take him for less hours anywhere in your country? It seems very very very unlikely.", "That's a great idea. With her understandable trust issues they could benefit from someone taking the load of the house work off and she can just focus on the baby and her own mental health.", ">I honestly can't see someone working 70 hours a week not having a nervous breakdown if you throw sleep deprivation into the mix.\n\nAnd let's not forget the drive time to and from work.  That adds to the sleep deprivation and danger of sleep driving.", "Yeah I think that\u2019s fair enough, particularly when one parent spends far more time as the primary caregiver. I just wanted to point out the expectation that is often placed on mothers to \u2018know their babies\u2019 when fathers are often given a pass of it being new and therefore not knowing what they\u2019re doing - it\u2019s new for mothers too and an extra burden to be expected to tell their spouse exactly how to deal with it.", "Yeah as a SAHP I sometimes catch a nap, but the trade off is that I haven't had a full night's sleep in over a year.\n\nI average about 5 hours a night these days.", "His job is one of the Most dangerous Blue collar Jobs you can have. If you want him to take nights, atleast sign a life insurance Cause she Will Soon be a widow \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "But more than half of his income goes to \"supplies\"?", "Yeah? Well she works 24/7. Or are you one of those freaks who thinks that parenting is just a woman\u2019s burden to bear silently and happily?", "My 38 hours a week in healthcare is far more exhausting than the 6 months i was home with my daughter. Cant imagine 68 hours a week welding. He Will break Soon", "Ijs it's not the same as a job like he has welding. I could not do it. I literally would come apart at the seams if I couldn't get uninterrupted sleep for more than 2 days, which is why I'd hire help rather than ask the welder to be sleep deprived", "What? No. Being a SAHM is a real job, and it's real work.\n\nI never said anything about her. You're projecting a lot onto my comment that isn't there.\n\nWhat I said was that he's objectively speaking working very long hours, so he's probably too exhausted. If I worked 68 hours a week, I'd probably be too tired to do much else, either. If they're both exhausted, then there's no point in saying \"well you need to do more\" or comparing who's doing what, because that only leads to arguments and resentment, rather than a healthy resolution of their issues.\n\nI think he needs to cut down on work for both of their sakes: less hours at work means he can help more at home, so she doesn't have to be no.1 caregiver 24/7. Or even to take some leave from work for a month or so if he can.\n\nThis is why paternity leave is so important. Not only so that men can better play an active role in child-rearing when it's at its most challenging and stressful, but also so they have a chance to bond with their child early in their development.", "Yeah it's normal, but OP, the baby's mother and the guy's partner, isn't getting that. She isn't getting anything, no time to shower or eat or sleep. The guy is though. That's the whole point.", "He could take the nightshift Saturday night to Sunday.", "He should get a part-time job.", "My husband and I have an 8 week old. He works, I'm at home with the baby. I do my best to get things done during the day, but when my husband is at home we share cooking and cleaning roughly equally, because looking after the baby is full-time. Every evening between about 7 and 10 he looks after our son so I can sleep, because the night shift looking after a newborn is hard and there's not a lot of sleep to be had.\n\nYou do need a break, you do deserve a break, and if your husband thinks that's not that case you should tell him you'll drop it if he still thinks your job is easy after doing a full day with the baby, and a full night, with you not helping at all. You could even make it easy on him by letting him space the day and night out!\n\nAs far as him taking on the financial burden goes, you doing all the childcare is directly contributing financially! Because if you weren't doing the childcare, how would he work? How much would it cost him to have a full time live-in nanny and cleaner if you weren't there?\n\n100% nta", "NAH - you're both taking on too much. \nIf he's earning decent money can you get a nanny a couple hours a week to help out?", "YTA. He's doing more than his fair share and you are whining about holding up your end of the bargain.", "What type of babies are y\u2019all having.. I am single mom and I had to work and take care of baby. While I\u2019m at work she is at day care. I pick her up as soon as I get off.  I come home to cook and other house work for my 7 year old. I know mother hood is not but dang is it really that hard?  YTA", "Everyone here has already laid out some good ideas for you. I just want to add that you could get in home childcare for two or three days a week and just stay there with them. \n\nI had that when my youngest was little. She took care of the baby like 8 hours a week. She was lovely and I never worried because I could at least hear everything going on. After a while she became one of the handful of people I would trust to watch my children. Sometimes, she\u2019d even pick my oldest up to take him to lunch and the movies. \n\nThe only issue I had with it was with my partner. He expected me to tackle big household projects during that time. It was supposed to be a time for me to decompress, but at first I was excited to actually accomplish some things that were impossible with my baby, and went overboard cleaning. Over time it became expected of me. Besides her, I had zero help. No diapers, cleaning, taking the baby for twenty minutes even. I was also trying to homeschool my oldest the following school year. I became beyond burned out and started to dread the time she came over because I just didn\u2019t have it in me to deep clean or organize. It was not her fault, she was amazing like I said, but the expectations placed on me sucked. \n\nSo please make sure that if you do get someone to come watch the baby, that you take that time for yourself. Go lock yourself in your room. Use a baby monitor if you need the peace of mind. Take a nap, watch a show, stare at the wall, whatever you need to feel happy and mentally sound!", "He makes nearly 20 grand a month and you\u2019re bitching that he doesn\u2019t do enough? Christ I hope he had you sign a prenup if you guys are married.", "NAH. You two have divided labor tasks. He\u2019s working extremely long hours, and if he\u2019s a welder, he\u2019s going to be physically exhausted when he comes home. He\u2019s working a 68 hour work week of a mentally and physically demanding job, so you can stay home, but you\u2019re upset he\u2019s not doing more for you. You both are going to end up feeling unappreciated. \n\nIt\u2019s also true that someone can instinctively wake up to some sounds, like alarms, where others don\u2019t penetrate sleep. Statistically, a man is less likely to wake up to a baby crying, than a woman, although it\u2019s possible for either to be so tired as to sleep through it.

Do you have a friend or relative who can help give you a break?\n\nSince he\u2019s pretty wiped out during the week, you should be careful asking him to watch the baby at the end of a long day. He could fall asleep, or worse, fall asleep on the couch holding the baby. \n\nYou could talk to him about giving you a break on Sunday, his day off. I don\u2019t know if your breastfeeding, pumping, or feeding formula, but unless the baby is bottlefed, it will be easier for your husband to help more with the kiddo when he\u2019s eating solid food. \n\nAlso, bring up to your husband that you want to start the habit of him interacting with his son when he gets home from work. It\u2019s easy for parents who work long hours to zone out when they get home, not wanting to be disturbed. But this is important bonding time. \n\nThe first few months are the hardest with a newborn, because they eat every two hours, then you burp, change them, and get them to sleep, for it all to start all over again. This is the most labor intensive time. It\u2019s important for you to get enough sleep, so that you don\u2019t drift off to sleep in the couch, holding the baby, either. \n\nGood luck. It\u2019ll get better.", "Did she discuss this with him, or is she just assumes? Those are very different things.", "I don\u2019t need to have one to know that working 68 hours per week as a welder is harder LMAO. Is it harder than a 40 hour per week office job? Obviously. No way it compares to the former", "I have to work 80+ hours a week seldom but when I do I don't go home for weeks at a time. My office has its own showers and I sleep on my office floor.\n\nBut fuck that shit. No one should be working 50+ hours a week.", "bot comment?", "He\u2019s likely have to move to an entirely different area", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to include eating dinner and getting ready for work/showering. It\u2019s not necessarily free time, but those are normal things people do everyday regardless of work. And if he gets to spend that time not on call to help with the baby then that is time all his own, not free time, but more time completely to himself than his wife gets on those days.\n\nSo is 14 hours a day is work, including commute, the lunch at work and getting out of the house then that\u2019s 87% of those if he were to only be awake for 16 hours. That is close to 90\n\nIf he worked 14 hours a day for 5 days and 10 hours on Saturday. That\u2019s 80 hours. If he\u2019s awake 16 hours then that would be 71 percent of his total waking hours for the week.\n\n71 and 87 percent are still less then the wife being on  call with the baby 100% of the time\n\nBut going your estimation he\u2019s getting 2.5 hours of free time and 1.5 hours of self care with showering, eating and getting groomed/dressed for the day. And he gets 7 hours of sleep straight which she doesn\u2019t. But the wife says she\u2019s getting maybe 1 hour a day without the baby. She needs breaks too. If this is a newborn then that is a full time job. And she is still recovering from pregnancy and birth. She should at least get the same 1 and a half hours for self care like eating, showering, taking a shit without the baby monitor like he does every day. And what\u2019s his excuse for only taking the baby for a couple hours on his days off.", "No I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what\u2019s happening because that\u2019s what she says is happening in the post. I don\u2019t think he shouldn\u2019t ever be on night duty, that doesn\u2019t seem fair", "To be honest it would be much easier for her to reevaluate her need for assistance by getting a nanny or hiring a cleaner. It would be far easier to do that than to expect him to flip everything. Sometimes that\u2019s just not an option right now but getting a nanny or a cleaner can happen at ANY TIME.", "So? When we had a child, we planned ahead and moved to a place that gave us better work life balance. So do millions of people every day. It's hardly rocket science!", "Blue collar workers pretty much have to shower after work. It would be nasty for me to lay in bed after being outside all day without showering and changing.", "I remember once being so tired with my second I fell asleep while carrying her down the stairs and we fell. We were fine luckily. But maybe we wouldn't be. Unless his job is to save lives/heavy construction/all day driving, he need to help keep his child and wife safe by sharing night duties. He helped create the baby, time at home is shared. She works as hard at least as he does while he is out of the house. And she doesn't get lunch or coffee or commute breaks. My husband has said time and time again that going to work is a break for him.", "That is confusing. I don\u2019t know if companies contract independent welders or not. I wouldn\u2019t think so.", "That doesn't make sense to me either. He makes 9k every two weeks, but spends 8k on supplies? So they're actually just living on 500 a week? \n\nI live in an area with lots of pipeline and oil field welding work, and I've definitely never heard of a company that required you to buy your own acetylene. It's just ridiculous and no one would ever work there since any welding job will pay you much more than 500 a week. Most companies do require you to buy your own FR clothing, boots and possibly your welding mask, but everything is always supplied. \n\nI don't know if the guy is lying to OP about how much he spends/what he's spending his money on, but there is no way that he's spending 4 grand a week on his own welding equipment.", "Totally, but I don't agree with the an hour for after work shower and getting ready in the morning.", "I take like 45 mins to get ready for work, including hair, face, shower, eat breakfast. I presume OP's husband isn't doing make up or spending a lot of time on his hair, but I could be wrong. His wide packs his lunch.\n\nIn days my husband gets up and leaves before the kids are up he's out of the house in 15 mins.", "I read it as 8k a month on supplies.", "INFO When do you get 6-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep?", "I was a sahm and raised 3 sons. My best advice is to really think about what can be done for a better balance and for your needs to be fulfilled. \n\nI started a moms club when I was pregnant with my third and it was a gift for all of us to meet other sahms and network and socialize for us and our kids. It was really supportive. It was a local chapter of the national moms club. Idk what their status is currently but it really helped me be connected to my community. \n\nAlso, think of how you can get a break if that\u2019s what you need. Perhaps a sitter for a few hours a week so you can go out, nap, or get a block of time for projects at home. Perhaps your husband will be willing to take over bath time or a little more one evening or weekend.  Maybe the answer is for him to bring home take out. Just ideas. \n\nYour job is 24/7 and even though your husband works hard and a lot of hours it\u2019s different so you have to work together to find the best way you can both be happy and be your best selves. \n\nSo, NTA for being honest with your husband.", "NAH but I will agree on that poster that said that maybe you should get a job so he could cut his hours and maybe that way you two can divide your time for the baby.", "I was going to say N A H, but tiny little bitty bit YTA. He works 6 days a week. Upwards of 60 plus hours and in a highly physical and stressful job. He\u2019s a welder. Based on the supplies you put her buys in your post. That is fucking grueling work. But that aside I st the reason for my judgment. The fact that you have considered asking for paid help, but haven\u2019t because of your own hang ups. Look, you can\u2019t pour from an empty cup. He isn\u2019t a deadbeat dad. He is a hardworking provider for your family. And this set up you agreed to. You could go back to work and you absolutely could get child care. The burn out is real and I totally understand. And you are correct, you aren\u2019t getting a break. The ONLY reason I am sayin YTA is that you have options that you have not tried and you are making him feel like a bad father for not contributing more when he probably doesn\u2019t really have much more he can give in a physical sense. Ask yourself, do you want him to get up in the middle of the night and help and not get sleep only to then go to work without proper sleep and accidentally miss a safety check and hurt himself? Please discuss having some childcare set up with your husband. Babies learn a ton when allowed at a daycare to play with other kids their age! They also learn great social skills. Try one day a week at first. Get a nice looooooong nap in while they are there.", "NTA. I think you all just need to sit down and explain to each other what is expected. However a stay at home mom isn't getting a lot of breaks period. Yes you are taking care of baby all day and cleaning and cooking and whatever else during the day but that's the job demands for that. \nMake sure you go outside when you can. To change it up.\nAlso you both need to make time for yourselves. Even if it's an hr a day after the baby goes down or a date night once a month get a relative to watch him maybe. Otherwise you will both feel neglected down the line. Ive seen so many peoples relationships fall apart cause of that. \nRemember there will always be bumps in the road while learning and never blame each other for short comings just have a Convo without the blame game.\nEnjoy while he's little it doesn't last long. Take pictures. There will always be new challenges the older he gets it's ok. Good luck new parents", "NAH it sounds like you are both stretched pretty thin, he has very long, physical work hours, and you aren\u2019t getting much of a break from being on call with parenting 24/7. Since he makes a good living, I would definitely suggest hiring someone to come in and clean for you, even if it\u2019s just once a month or something to give you a little break from that, and if you have any family around that you trust to watch the baby, maybe see if they can do that for an afternoon so you can catch up on some sleep or go out and do something fun, or for the two of you to go out and have a date night or some thing.", "Particularly because babies tend to sleep for 10 hours a night. So he's home for, what, 2 hours a day with an awakened baby and that 2 hours is immediately after he gets off a shift and is probably exhausted.", "If the guy is working 12 hour shifts 5 days a week and another 8-10 on Saturday, then I'm not terribly surprised he doesn't hear the baby cry at night - he's probably sleeping right through it from sheer exhaustion.", "Mother's helper would be the perfect balance here, tbh. OP doesn't trust caregivers, but having someone that you're pretty much supervising makes it a lot easier.\n\nYou're basically paying someone to hang out with you and \"hey can you watch the baby for 30 minutes while I shower?\"", "He's mentally exhausted from paying the bills.\n\nShe's mentally exhausted from watching the child 24/7.\n\nThey're both worn to the bone.\n\nShe's refusing childcare, whereas (per the OP) boyfriend cannot reduce his hours.

Will you go back to work?", "He's saying \"I feel awful I don't spend enough time around the baby because of my hellish work schedule.\" and then was hoping for reassurance that the money he provided was at least worth it by providing for them. Instead he got confirmation that OP is not happy with the help being given, because she (rightfully) is exhausted too. The problem, and primary sticking point, is OP's refusal to accept outside help - something they could easily afford.

She cleaned her house and then popped over to mine and helped with stuff like that while I adjusted.
