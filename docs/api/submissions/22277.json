A little background before I get into it. I am a stay at home mom and he works full time (hours are normally 12 hours a day M-F and 6-8 hours on Saturday). This is both of ours first time being a parent so we are figuring it out as we go basically. Last week he expressed to me that he doesn\u2019t feel like he helps enough and to his surprise I agreed. \n\nI knew getting into our relationship that I would be a stay at home mom. His mom was one and he loved it. Not to mention his working hours so I knew that it would be hard just not this hard. Basically I take the baby all day and night since he works. He only takes the baby for about 20 minutes to an hour when he gets home and he helps clean the babies bottles every other day. Sometimes on his day off he will take the baby so I can sleep in for two hours. But that\u2019s all the help I get. I told him during this arrangement that he doesn\u2019t give me a break. Plain and simple. He got defensive about how he\u2019s the one who has the financial burden and I agree it can\u2019t be a good feeling wondering if you can feed your family. But he makes a good 9k every 2 weeks so it\u2019s not like we are drowning. Anyways, he asked me why I didn\u2019t think he was helping and I told him that I do the cooking, cleaning, laundry, most of the bottles, bath time, overnights, and during the day. I get a 20 min to an hour break when I\u2019m eating supper after he\u2019s done with his meal. He claimed that he can\u2019t hear the baby crying at night which I think is crazy because the baby screams bloody murder most of the time. So I told him that was bs since he wakes up on the ring of his alarm. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong here. I get what I said probably hurt his feelings but he doesn\u2019t help. He told if I feel that way then I need to ask for help. I told him I shouldn\u2019t have to ask for him to help with his baby. If the baby is hungry he should be able to feed it. If the diaper needs changed he should be able to change it etc.\n\nEdit: I would like to thank everyone for commenting but I would also like to address a few things \n\n1- my boyfriend is blue collar so me going back to work wouldn\u2019t magically mean he works less it just means we would both have crazy hours since my prior job required me to be on call a lot and some stranger would be raising our son. He also loves his job and if he had the option I don\u2019t think he\u2019s cut down on hours anyways \n\n2- some of you were concerned with my age and not being able to support myself if things go bad. Prior to having my son I was a social worker so I could always go back.\n\n3- I wouldn\u2019t consider us rich by any means but I thinks that\u2019s mainly because 8k of his monthly income goes back into his work supplies. (Oxygen and acetylene tanks, rods, FR clothing, ect) \n\n4- I have thought about getting his opinion on hiring help, but I do have trust issues due to my prior work experience and even some personal experience with child abuse, neglect, things like that. So that\u2019s on me for sure \n\n5- I never meant to make him feel like a dead beat. I know he loves our son with everything in him it\u2019s just the lack of help. I do agree I could have worded things better though. \n\n6- I do not sit all day and just watch my baby sleep that\u2019s for sure. He does get hot meals when he comes home and I do pack his lunch for him since I know if he did it himself he\u2019d make pb&js lol", "created_utc": 1689397043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1502gy8/aita_for_agreeing_with_my_boyfriend_when_he_said/", "score": 948, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which is unfair, however I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to discount the hardship of having a job even if the job makes a bunch of money. And Idk how the conversation went down but him saying he feels like he doesn\u2019t do much\u2026he probably meant it but might\u2019ve just wanted you to listen before saying anything. And while you might not think you needed to ask and he should\u2019ve just done it, might be true in some cases it might not be true for him because if he was raised with a stay at home mom and his experience was probably what he\u2019s doing with you and your kid now because he views it as normal. I think there definitely needs to be a conversation of how he could help more, because you definitely need a longer break.

My husband understood that I needed those naps, and so he doesn\u2019t get on me about if a chore isn\u2019t done or dinner is late (he never did before but still lol).\n\nThere have been a couple nights where I knew I needed help, so I woke up my husband and he took over and got the baby back to sleep.\n\nI communicated that I needed it, and he accepted, as I\u2019m sure your bf would if you asked.\n\nBut there needs to be communication.\nI obviously don\u2019t know your relationship or what you\u2019ve already talked about, so I apologize if you have already.\n\nYou are both new to this, and that\u2019s ok.\n\nEven if you were both able to communicate properly before, it all changes once you have a baby.\nYou have to relearn each other.\n\nYou\u2019re both going to want validation (what I believe he wanted), assurance, you\u2019re going to argue about what\u2019s best for your baby, you\u2019re going to tell him to hold the baby\u2019s head this way instead of that and he may get defensive and vice versa, because you both want to be good parents and want the other to believe that baby is safe with you.\n\nSo relearn each other.\n\nNavigate this great new experience together, and grow together, all three of you.\n\nBoth of you are contributing into growing a whole separate human being, in some ways similar, and others not.

This is a pretty long working week, especially if he has a commute! I expect he spends his day off recovering and feeling like a zombie.\n\nA baby is a lot to manage, and needing a bit of help is normal - this is why humans live and reproduce in pairs, and usually as part of a larger social structure. However, I'm afraid you're unlikely to get much more help from your partner - he is already overworked and giving all he's got. I'm impressed he's still functioning and not completely burnt out.\n\nI believe you should consider the following options:\n1) You get a job, allowing him to cut down his working hours and either split childcare so that while one is working, the other is looking after Baby OR use paid childcare while you are both working\n2) You get help from someone else - family or a hired \"nanny\" (there may be a more up-to-date term, I'm not sure)\n\nAlso bear in mind that parenting doesn't come naturally to everyone. Yes, you know the baby is crying because they need a feed, but does he know that? Does he actually just need to be told \"Hey, I think Baby needs a feed. Can you?\" It's become routine for you, but he's had less time to learn and get used to what he's meant to do, because he already has a full time job occupying his time and mind.\n\nRegarding the conversation you had, still NAH. He was looking for reassurance because he's giving all he's got and worried that it's not enough, and you confirmed that it's not enough. And now everyone's upset. BUT you guys aren't in it alone.

Do you want him to fall asleep driving home after a 12 hour shift because that is what will happen. Being a SAHP is hard work but your concept of \"fair\" is unreasonable. If you want him to work less hours, draw up a budget and discuss this. Another option is to hire some help with cleaning or have childcare once a week so you can run errands. Maybe you need to discuss returning to work and putting bubs into child care or getting a nanny. But your husband isn't out having fun while you stay home. He is also working.", "YTA this would have been n ah but you don\u2019t want to hire child care. Sorry you can\u2019t have it both ways your bf is working like crazy to support you all and you want to be a sahm that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t go off at him because you need more help and you want it from him. Let me tell you as someone who worked crazy hours when his son was born all he is thinking is is baby/gf ok are we ok if we need the dr or hospital he isn\u2019t killing himself working because he wants to but because he thinks he needs to.", "Yea , your boyfriend works a lot. Being an SAHM requires you to do most of the work regarding care and housework. When exactly do you expect him to give you \"breaks\" if he works 12 hours a day?

He wanted to tell him his feeling is wrong? To assure him it's okay and to quell his conscious? That's kinda manipulative. \n\nInstead of continue to talk about how he can be more involved so it won't be a problem, for either of you, he got defensive that you agreed with him? \nHmm.

I'm sorry, but you are in a committed relationship, maybe you should put on your communication skills and say, hey babe, the baby's hungry, would you please help me feed him? Hey babe, I know you are so tired after work, but would you mind at least having an hour or two with him while I sleep? I'm sorry but you literally invalidate his job all over this post and make it seem like it's just an easy enough job that anyone can do. You literally described his job as being difficult and not one where he just sits in a cozy office shooting the shit all day. He's literally providing you with a roof over your head, the ability to never have to worry about bills being paid, and supplies for your child. Not saying being a mom is not difficult by any means, but by this post, you make it seem like your job is much more difficult than his. Yes, you do the cooking, cleaning, feeding the child, bathing the child, entertaining the child, and just overall being there at a moment's notice when the baby screams \"bloody murder.\" You have your job, he has his job, how about you reassure him that hey I would love more help, let's talk about what you would be able to do and for how long, and oh by the way, I'm grateful that you provide for me and our baby.

Some kind of service once or twice a week and you stay out of the way with baby? Then there\u2019s less strain on you and you can actually get better breaks while baby sleeps.\n\nOther than that, I think that while parents are home, the childcare should be split 50/50. You both work during the day and then you need to split the remaining work when you\u2019re both at home. Special allowance could be made for him considering the insane hours and blue collar labour, so it looks closer to 60/40.

He does work a ton. \n\nI see how you feel about outside help, what about a mother's helper? It's usually a younger teen, someone who isn't quite ready to babysit yet but loves kids or maybe babysits kids a bit older but not babies. They wouldn't be alone with the baby but they would help you out for a bit while you do things around the house. It could be a fun way to get a little company, build a relationship with a future babysitter, and get things done around the house a little easier with less stress and without triggering your childhood trauma.

A cleaner/housekeeper for 1-2 hours a day could tidy, do the baby bottles, dishes, floors, start a load of laundry or fold a finished load, change beds, empty trash, put away a grocery delivery etc etc. Leaving you time to enjoy your baby, breathe, shower, nap, go out with the little one without the weight of household chores hanging over you.

Believe me, I know what it's like to feel like you're barely caring for your child because you're constantly trying to keep the household from turning into a pigsty, and keep everyone fed. You can likely afford to hire help in that department to allow you to say least rest when baby rests. Or go out and do things, socialize with the baby in tow.\n\nDad: can he commit to doing more when he's around? Can you sleep in another room one night a week and let him tend the baby overnight? I guarantee if you give him a walkthrough of how it works, then put in earplugs & play white noise on the other side of the house, you will sleep like a log.\n\nDoes he need other tutorials in how to care for the baby after work? Can he commit to taking responsibility for them for 2 hours in the evening? Including bath & bed? Sometimes schedules don't allow that. But he needs to drive his own involvement - responding to the babies cries first even if he has to ask you *at first* what he needs: food, diaper, wind, cuddles? If he wants to feel more connected to his son, as well as take the pressure off his wife, he needs to actively do it. Not easy with the hours he works, I know.\n\nCan he change his work schedule? Stop working weekends?\n\nSole earner pressure: can you guys have a discussion about finances? Just cos you're a SAHM now, doesn't mean it has to be forever. He earns great money now and the baby get easier as they get older. Maybe when he's 3, he can go to preschool (great for socialisation and group childcare often has several adults on the spot, so less opportunity for abuse if that's your concern) for 15-20hrs a week, while you work on something - job hunt or education or entrepreneurial idea? Even if paid childcare is a financial loss/breaking even, it's a time investment in your future career.\n\nWould it help him feel more secure if you guys looked back at bank statements to see how your expenses are going? Do you have an emergency fund and/or other savings? Are you similar financially eg: both frugal or both spendy? Can you make a financial plan for the future together? Do you need to set up a budget plan together?\n\nDo you both want more children? How would that work?\n\nSolve it together! That's the only way a ~~marriage~~ relationship works.

If he works 68 hours a week then that\u2019s between 60-70% of his waking hours for the week assuming he\u2019s up for 14-16 hours a day. Assuming he\u2019s up 14-16 hours a day then 12 hour shifts are 75-85% of his waking hours on those days.

My husband has worked 12+ hour workdays his entire career. He has also done contract jobs that had him gone most of the week, sometimes months at at time. I've had to carry a lot of the childcare load by myself. But even with that - I've never changed a baby diaper during the first 10 days post-pardom. Because my husband took time off work to be there. He made a point of taking over childcare for me after work some days so that I could go to bed early. He let me sleep late when he had days off. He sent me out of the house to spend time with friends for at least a few hours almost **every Saturday for 9 straight years** to make sure that I had an opportunity to be someone other than Mom.

Marriage is about equality, as I found out with my new wife of 17 years. \nNot saying that you\u2019re right or wrong, but my first marriage didn\u2019t last because of the similarities between our relationships. \nBest to work this issue out now and be understanding and to balance the household responsibilities. \nAs a stay home parent you will have to do more than if you worked. Not saying he has to do less or any but I can see this relationship being on the rocks if there isn\u2019t any understanding of who is required to do what. \n\nI spent two years off of work in school and healing from three major surgeries. Learned how to walk 3 times. My current wife did everything and made sure our son got his chemotherapy. \nNow she is going to school and working part time. I am healed and back to work. I am able to help out more with housekeeping but I do more of the outside stuff and she does more of the inside stuff. We balance it out and when we need help we ask each other. We make it work.", "NTA but neither is he, I get you both are new at this but if you dont ask for help, you wont get it. Honestly lack of communication is the reason for most problems, both assuming you can reach each other's minds and waiting for the other to say something.", "NAH\n\nI am so glad so many agree on this!\n\nOP \"it takes a village\". Get yourselves some help. I get your trust issues, but you don't have to go \"all or nothing\" with childcare. Have someone come into your home. Check-in as much or as little as you need to feel comfortable. Install cameras. This would still give you some time to clean, take a nap, meal prep, or vice-versa. Have someone do these things while you care for baby.", "I do agree with what you\u2019re saying but the whole \u2018you know what your baby needs but your husband doesn\u2019t know\u2019 is like\u2026 such a typical example pointing towards the kind of skewed mental load women very very often take on in relationships with men.\n\nLike I recently had a convo with my husband about chores where part of the conversation was about him not knowing what needs doing/not seeing what is there - and it\u2019s true, he genuinely doesn\u2019t walk into a room going, \u2018Oh x, y and z need doing\u2019 like I do. But that\u2019s also not my problem to fix, and it\u2019s not my job to teach him or tell him what needs doing every single time.\n\nSo I told him how I wake up every single morning with a list of chores in my head that need doing. On my Saturdays and Sundays, I wake up with, \u2018The weeding needs doing so I\u2019ll do that this morning, oh the bathroom needs cleaning so I\u2019ll pencil that in for this evening, oh yeah I also need to hoover, hmm ok well when can I get to the gym? Maybe if I do that at 11am I will then have time to get back and have an hour on the PlayStation before I clean the kitchen.\u2019\n\nAnd he was like \u2018\u2026oh. I legitimately had no idea.\u2019 Because when he wakes up, he thinks, \u2018It\u2019s Saturday! I\u2019m gonna go get coffee and watch YouTube.\u2019 Like that stuff just isn\u2019t even in his head. So yeah, I can tell him to do it when it needs doing, but I still hold that huge list in my head and he doesn\u2019t. So it needs to get in his head and he needs to do it himself, it\u2019s not my job to tell him. He needs to take the initiative and force himself to see and learn for himself (which he totally accepted and is doing).\n\nSo yeah. It\u2019s just so often something pushed onto women that, \u2018Well you know the baby needs x and he doesn\u2019t, just tell him!\u2019 But that is a chore/job in itself and needs to be recognised as such.", "OP confirmed in another comment that he can\u2019t just lower his hours, he\u2019d have to switch jobs entirely", "Even when you expect it, it is a surprise.   \nMy advice is to hire a housekeeper----even if it is just once a month.

It's new father was lamenting that he wishes he could spend more time with his child and his wife instead of just listening decided to take a pot shot at him. \n\nHe works an insane amount of hours and his current career means he can't cut back.

I meant that he gets how hard being with the baby alone all day is. Upon rereading that I felt like that may come across wrong. \n\nSorry, I don\u2019t comment on things very often and I\u2019m a little anxious about it but I really related to your post and wanted to say something!", "Your husband is still working about 20 hours per week less than OP\u2019s (about 30 less on the weeks he doesn\u2019t work Fridays), yet that still isn\u2019t enough and she refuses to hire any help.

That way she can actually nap when the baby naps.", "NTA but I will point out that you agreed to be a SAHM.", "Literally nothing implies that he bullied her into it. It\u2019s the arrangement she agreed upon, and if she needs help/wants to change the arrangement then she has to talk about it", "You can probably even just send your laundry out if you don\u2019t want someone in your home. Also look into local meal delivery services. I\u2019m not talking about Fresh or Blue Plate or whatever where you still have to do all of the work. I\u2019m talking about fully-cooked gourmet meals delivered to your front door. There\u2019s probably a specific company for that if you live in a city of any size, but if you can\u2019t easily find one, call your local caterers. \n\nIf you\u2019re super rural, I guarantee you someone in town would love to make some extra money by cooking for y\u2019all. \n\nIf none of this is an option, then at least make copious use of your grocery store\u2019s deli department. They almost certainly have tons of ready food. \n\nYou can do this! Just make your own life a little easier.", "You\u2019re right in this, he does need proper food. Like literally physically, he needs well-balanced meals with plenty of carbs and protein to fuel his body.", "I\u2019m going to add that y\u2019all should be saving a significant amount, more than most families, in anticipation of the time when his body inevitably gives out and he can\u2019t continue this type of work. That\u2019s hopefully still a long way off, but closer than you think, and easier to save aggressively now. Throw that into a compound interest account. There\u2019s still plenty of money available for you to get some help, though!", "Would you honestly rather work 68 hours per week as a welder take care of one baby every day? I am not even a fan of kids/babies at all and that would still be an extremely easy choice lmao, that many hours as a welder is clearly more brutal", "Did you read the post? \ud83e\uddd0", "I seem to remember that biologically, women are also more sensitive to high-pitched sounds in general.

Just because the husbands situation is even more grueling doesn\u2019t mean hers is easy lmao", "Yes of course, only if it's safe to do so. It's also dangerous to look after an infant when you're seriously sleep deprived. It can worsen PPD, cause you to fall asleep at the wheel, drop your infant, fall asleep with them in an unsafe position and smother them, etc etc. If she's struggling and it's not possible for him to take over sometimes, they need to accept outside help of some sort.", "It helps that there are no villains here. Hardworking boy supporting his family but worried that he's not spending enough time with the baby. Hardworking girl running the household and raising a child, feeling a little burned out. This is solveable if they work together. \n\nI think it's his work hours that make this so challenging. If he had a standard 9-5, his evenings could be Daddy Time and give her a little break. She could even pick up a night job to keep her resume current and offload some of the financial stress from him. \n\nAs is, I think hiring help would be best. Maybe a mother's helper or a house cleaner to come by when OP is home, since she's reluctant to trust the baby to a stranger right now.", "Good catch. Still, having a baby together is far more binding than marriage, imo", "Tax deductible doesn't mean he gets to keep it or get it back from the government, it just means he can subtract that amount of income from the amount of income he pays taxes on.\n\nSo like if you spend $50 on work equipment you can tell the IRS \"hey I spent this much on my job\" the IRS will say \"oh nice then you don't have to pay income tax on that $50 because you spent it on work.\" So you don't have to give the IRS like $10 out of that $50 of income, you get to keep that $10. And if you have your taxes set up to deduct from your paycheck regularly then you wpuld get that $10 back as either a return (which is you having over paid on your taxes) or it reduces your tax liability for that year (you didn't pay enough in taxes for the whole year, but now you have to pay $10 less than if you didn't deduct it.)\n\nTax deductions ARE NOT the IRS saying \"oh you spent $50 on work stuff then you have to pay $50 less on your taxes\"", "You have no idea where she\u2019s from though and that makes a huge impact.

It's closer to 18% of individuals make over 100k and just over 34% of households (combined) make over 100k. I live in SoCal, in Healthcare, am a single mom, and make 90k and I'm telling you I'll be lucky if I ever get to own a home someday. In SoCal most homes are at least 500k.

He probably started that job as a boomer. Which is a reference for somebody whom travels for work. Like extending a telescopic crane boom known as booming out. \n\nSwitching to another welding job as pipeline or oil field welder which I assume he is a pipeliner more than likely require moving. \n\nDifferent areas have different pay scales.
