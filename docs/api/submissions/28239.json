I'm also an only child and I've had to put my foot down with my mother several times.  I love her and do care for her, but there are conditions on that, like she has to regularly take her medication, etc.", "NTA, have you reminded your father about how he felt when he was in this situation. I don't see how you will have much traction until the first emergency when you cannot get there due to the time it takes to get there. When that happens, you might finally have a chance to get them to move.", "NTA - Parents need to deal with reality, their kids cannot and should not reorder their lives around taking care of their parents when there are perfectly good places near their children to move to.  Putting additional burdens on your children for you is selfish and disrespectful.  They need to sell their place and get a nice condo or apartment near you if they expect you to take of them in old age.  That's it, take it or leave it, mom and pop.", "INFO: Have you told your dad he's pulling a gma?", "Wait.\n\nIt sounds as though your parents are still independent, but coming to the realisation that this won't be true for very much longer. That is likely to make them massively value the personal independence they've never had to think about. And they're most likely to be able to keep that in the house and the area they know: to potter along with minimal changes until something goes too badly wrong. Don't take that away from them.\n\nOnce they do need regular care, once they accept they aren't going to go back to independent life, when their everyday surroundings remind them of what they have lost, when their current house is too much for them: that will be the time to suggest moving.\n\nIn the meantime, support in case of emergencies can be bought. Local charities for the elderly should be able to advise. Maybe they can arrange for someone to go in twice a week to clean. It won't be you, but if they pay for it, if it's not family, they're still independent in a way they won't be if they're dependent on you doing it. And these days, you can provide a huge amount of moral support over video calls.\n\nI know you want to care for them out of love, which is why you're NTA, but as with parents honouring their children by letting them leave the nest, it's also important to honour your parents' self-respect.\n\nAnd if something goes dreadfully wrong? If you can't make it to the bedside before they die? It's not the end of the world if you know why you weren't there: you were giving them the gift of more time before age robbed them of their independence. For all their money which they can't take with them, that could be their most valuable possession apart from their relationships.", "NTA.\n\nI have 3 kids and I will be damned if they're going to uproot their lives to take care of their mom and me, ever.

They are choosing to live in West Stabbington, let them take care of themselves, if they want to be closer to you, they can act like it.", "NTA, you are absolutely right not to move back to the place you dislike. It is necessary for your parents to compromise if they want your support, otherwise they have to accept outside assistance.", "NTA. As an only child, I was exactly in your position, but thankfully, my parents did move closer to me. And now that my dad passed away last year, I'm even more thankful since I'm literally 1/2 mile away from my mom and can be there for her and she's not alone.

Assuming you and your husband have jobs, and your parents are retired, it's pretty silly for them to think that you should be the ones to move.", "NTA. But quit trying to bend yourself into a pretzel.

If they insist it is, tell them you'll call 911 for them. You need to start telling them you can't get there. You are busy. You have plans. You can find a handyman in their area. But they have to pay for the services. \n\nYou tell your dad he's turning into his parents. See how he feels about that. Your parents are getting older but they're not old.", "NTA.  When my dad died, mom was 74, and while lonely, was able to take are of herself.  I made her a deal at that time - you tell me when you want to change living arrangements, I will tell you when you have to.  Unfortunately, I had to tell her about 6 months before she passed away because she required too much to care to be on her own, and moving into my home wasn't an option.  Remind your father of his obligations to his mother, and if that doesn't help ... just dig your heals in and say this is how it has to be.", "Start calling him Grandma to get your point across that he\u2019s acting just as she did and then maybe he\u2019d see your point of view.

They know what the alternative is while they are healthy enough to do it.", "Nta.  Get them set up with home health.", "You can also not drive anywhere. If they want to stay three, they get what they signed up for - rotting. NTA.", "NTA. Also, you are not obligated to take care of your parents. But if you wish to, you need to make it a requirement that they move. Next time they need something, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t drive 5 hours to be at your beck and call. Set some boundaries for yourself. You will be much happier.", "Sharing my story in hopes it will help. Only child with my parents living an hour away. My mom died last September; my 84 year old dad thought he could live on his own. I arranged for meals on wheels and his neighbors and friends said they would keep an eye on him - I did not expect them to watch him 24/7 that wouldn't be fair. We asked him to come live with us and we will buy a larger home in our town but he didnt want to move. After 3 medical emergencies/hospitalizations within a month he was told that he could not live by himself for safety reasons. He went to assisted living while we decluttered and sold his house and  bought a larger house in our town and moved him in with us. He is getting better and more thorough medical care in our town than in his former small town. He's also closer to his granddaughters and sees them much more often than when he was further away. Best wishes to you!", "NTA\u2026if they want to stay where they are, then I suggest looking into future solutions now.  And let them know that you will not be like dad was for grandma, (which you can\u2019t really understand, since he complained about the drive all the time, you would think he would understand where you are coming from), and drive every weekend or every time there is an emergency.  They need to have plans in place for their possible future.", "Face this with FIL.  He is even further away but won\u2019t move near us. Safe area, he can afford it or live with us. Basically he is on his own. They need to take care of themselves or hire help. You can\u2019t be there it\u2019s too far away", "NTA.  Ask them what their plan is for when they have an emergency.  Also ask your dad why he's copying his mother when it was so frustrating to him.", "NTA bring up what your grandma did, tell them they better find a nurse to take care of them because you aren\u2019t moving to a shitty town.", "NTA. I am in a similar situation. I have an older half brother and half sister but my father disowned my half brother (he hasn\u2019t been in contact with him for 20 years) and my half sister is more than likely going to pass before my mother (years of hard drugs, heart problems and unhealthy living habits). Because of this, I was raised like an only child and had little to no contact with my half siblings. I had pretty much accepted that it would be up to me to help my parents when they got older. \n\nI moved away from my hometown 8 years ago to a coastal town that I love very much. I tried my best to convince my parents to come with me. They are very well off and could have easily afforded a beautiful beach front home if they wanted, but they refused to leave the town where they both grew up which is understandable. Although I missed them, I had built a life for myself in my new town and they encouraged me to live where I was the happiest. \n\nHowever, two years ago, my mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She\u2019s now cancer free but it made me realize that they won\u2019t be here for long and that I already missed 8 years with them due to being away. My dad just turned 75 this year and my mom will be 67 in November. I decided to move back home this year and realized that they aren\u2019t doing as well (health wise) as they had previously portrayed to me. I feel like I moved back at the right time and I\u2019m at peace with my decision. My parents were supportive of me with whatever I chose to do. My mom told me that she didn\u2019t expect me to take care of them in their old age because that wouldn\u2019t be fair to me. My mom is like my best friend and I love my dad so I chose to come back for them. Emphasis on I chose. I was not pressured. It was my decision and I felt at peace. \n\nNo matter what you do, choose whatever makes you happy because at the end of the day, it\u2019s your life. I know that this situation is a double edged sword. Do you move away from a city where you\u2019re living your best life back to a crap hole to take care of your parents or do you continue to live where you\u2019re the happiest and try to find alternative solutions to caring for your parents (i.e., at home nurses, nanny cams around their home to check on them, etc.)? Just know that you are not selfish if you choose to stay where you are. You obviously love your parents but it\u2019s not fair for them to expect you to drop your life to tend to them. I know for years I struggled with extreme guilt when emergencies popped up and it took me a day or two to get to them but with the help of my therapist, I realized that I shouldn\u2019t put all of that on myself. You shouldn\u2019t either. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a life to live where you are.  I don't know if you are married with children, but if you are (and even if you are single) you are now in your working years.  They are not.  It is easier for them to move than have you move.  They just don't want to.\n\nTell them you will visit one weekend a month, and that's it.  If there are emergencies, they will have to deal with it because you are 5 hours away.\n\nI live in a 55+ neighborhood, and LOTS of people have moved to be by their adult children and grandchileren.", "Being an only child as your parents age is a whole thing isn\u2019t it?", "Unfortunately that\u2019s probably what it will take", "I would understand if they didn\u2019t have the ability to move but they do.", "Yes!

I am not an only but my sibling lives 10+ hours away and never got along my with our Mom. My Wife and I can tolerate her, but only just. She has done some incredibly stupid stuff at times, and you literally have to reconcile with the fact that parents get childish as you get older.\n\nShe called one day with a head-ache and racing pulse.  Wife took her to the ER where they gave her fluids. She later admitted (guiltily like a small child) that she had eaten a whole box of salty crackers and given herself a blood pressure spike, headache and panic attack.  \n\nShe is frail, but has ADHD.  She regularly walks quickly into danger...like traffic...swinging doors...she was walking quickly while looking back and tripped over landscaping once and ended up in the ER again.", "It shouldn\u2019t be.  I say this as an old lady.  I would never want my kids to go (too far) out of their way for me.  If I broke a hip?   Visit if you can, keep me in rehab till I can motivate on my own again.  I didn\u2019t have kids to help in my old age.  They have lives.  I want them to enjoy that as much as possible.  NTA.  They aren\u2019t doing the very thing that makes you helping possible.  That\u2019s on them.", "Sometimes you have to get blunt, that's what got through to my dad. It hurt us both but was necessary. We moved past it.", "Cat time is legitimate time.", "Ok to be fair to your mother, I\u2019m 43 and cognitively sound (or so I\u2019m told), and I definitely could do all of the above at any moment. I think she and I both suffer from what my mom called \u201cbeing a dingbat\u201d."]}
