Which is to say, the tailgaters reaction was way out of line.\n\nNTA. Drive safe.", "NTA\n\nYou drove safely, driver behind you was a jerk.", "NTA\n\nDon't get out of your car. If someone is raging. Don't pull over. If you made a mistake. As long as no collision occurred. Correct yourself, keep going, follow traffic laws and ignore the person honking or tailgating. Eventually you will separate from them.\n\nYou were driving defensively. Even if you may have legally had the right away over someone backing out. It's best to avoid a collision. So, you anticipated their maneuver stopped and proceeded with caution. Until they either backed out or you could tell they were aware of your presence and stopped.\n\nJust be aware of your circumstances and ignore the jerks. When I have tailgaters. Since my car has adaptive cruise control. They are even easier to ignore now and I don't feel the pressure to speed up. I just set the speed to the speed limit and let my car take over.", "Look at it like this: if the Polizei had seen these events unfold, which driver do you think they would have stopped to talk with?  I would suggest that they would not be talking with you but with Mr Angry - and most likely, they would have given him a ticket for tailgating under 80km/h, which would be a fine of at least \u20ac25 and maybe some points in Flensburg.", "NTA. It's totally normal to respond to unexpected movement. It's also normal to be upset by the driver in front of you suddenly braking, but honking and tailgating is absolutely unnecessary and doesn't help the situation at all. I hate tailgating so much, it makes me focus on the driver so much more than I should. Well, anyway, always be careful when suddenly braking, although I know it's easier said than done. It's a response for not wanting to hurt anyone, so it makes sense, doesn't it? Driver behind you was being the asshole, totally", "NTA.  I am sorry this upset you so badly.  The environment set you up; narrow roads, heavy traffic and other impatient drivers.\n\nLet it go and don't worry about it.  Even if maybe you could have done something else, so what?  Neither you or anyone else got hurt or damaged your vehicles.  \n\nIn this decade it seems (at least in the US) people are behaving more and more aggressively all the time over the smallest & stupidest things.

If this guy almost hit you, that's his fault because he was tail gaiting you. \n\nThe only thing I think you did wrong was get out of the car to try to talk and explain, when this guy was in a full on rage. He could have gotten out and tried to hit you, any number of things.", "NTA: You did the right thingM and the asshole was the guy honking. But let this be a lesson to you, never get out of the boat!", "I hate those roads. Hate hate hate. NTA.  \nIf I've understood correctly that person hit your car while you were stationary, there's no way you're the AH in that situation.  \nIn my country we have these magnetic things you can stick to the car that tell people you're newly qualified and nervous. You don't have to be newly qualified to use them and I used them for about 6 months when I started driving after a long break. I think people gave me extra space when I used them. I don't know if there's an equivalent in Germany.  \nThe other person is an AH for hitting you but also for shouting and honking. He has to share the road with anxious drivers as well as confident ones and his behaviour makes the roads more dangerous because it stresses the anxious drivers out, making them more likely to make a mistake.", "NTA\n\nYou drove slowly, so sounds good to me. In Germany honking is normal. I live in Stuttgart and they are also honking, when you wait for pedestrians on a crosswalk. Or when you following the speed signs instead of driving +50% faster than allowed.\n\nSome persons have a bad anger management and just like to honk & rage.", "NTA. All drivers occasionally make mistakes (usually small ones that don\u2019t have any real impact - stalling, forgetting to signal etc). When you do, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised by getting honked at, but following you to yell at you is totally out of order.", "Thank you very much! I guess that maybe if I had paid better attention to the drivers in the other lane I could have noticed they had stopped for a reason, but sadly, I did not think that far ahead.", "Fun fact; generally speaking the car horn is actually just a giant sign that says 'The driver of this vehicle is an asshole' whenever you press it.", "This! Never get out of your car when someone is \"road raging\" they're clearly already mentally unstable and all you did was put yourself in a potentially harmful situation.", "Thank you for your kind words. I was so unnerved by all of this that I was actually afraid that I would get in trouble for needlessly braking or causing an obstruction. I should have paid more attention to what the incoming traffic was doing but I guess hindsight is always 20/20."]}
