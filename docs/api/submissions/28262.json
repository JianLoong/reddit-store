Around here, you expect a true friend to point out when you are being a moron - ideally *before* being a moron has any negative consequences. Letting your friend make a huge mistake without making a single attempt to get their head straight, *knowing* that you could speak up and help them out, and then shit talking them behind their back on an anonymous internet forum is not what friends do, at least that is how I grew up and how things around me work. People make mistakes. People overlook things. People are kind of stupid sometimes. Nobody is immune to this. That's why everything in this thread is so utterly baffling to me.", " Me too given some of you seem to think OP is responsible for his friend's carelessness to the point it makes him an asshole.", "I don't see where he's talking a bunch of shit, seems like most of what he did was let his friend almost get fired and then tell him that he was stupid for doing so.\n\n\nHonestly I'd view this as a lesson learned for the friend.

He is an idiot. A complete moron.
