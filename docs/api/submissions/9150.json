I asked her what was wrong and she told me she found her cat dead that morning before school. \n\nI told Zoe we could do our session another day and that she should go home and try to relax. Zoe agreed and I drove her home and dropped her off.\n\nZoe's parents are now irritated and said that I should've asked for their permission before taking thei daughter home and cancelling the tutoring session.\n\nI told them I wouldn't charge them for the session that we missed but they said that's not the point, and that I should've contacted them before making the decision to cancel the session and take Zoe home. \n\nThey said I was overstepping.\n\nThey said they wouldn't fire me \"this time\" because my tutoring has gotten Zoe's grades up and my rate is reasonable but they told me to think about what I did.\n\nI really don't think it's that serious and I think they're overreacting when I was just trying to be compassionate to their daughter.

You made the absolute right call with regard to their daughter and about not charging them, that\u2019s very decent of you, and they should be acknowledging that. They sound like AHs.", "oh.

Think about if you wanna work for these heartless robots. Think hard. NTA", "As a parent who has had regular weekly Speech Pathology and OT sessions for a kid, sessions can and have been cancelled at the last moment, on both sides.  If they cancel, no charge, if I cancel, there would be a charge.  Last minute cancellations are a fact of life.\n\nYou did the right thing by cancelling.  Zoe would not have been in the right mind to absorb information which would have been not only a waste of money for the parents, but a waste of everyone's time.\n\nNTA.  You're a very compassionate person.", "Hmmmmm.... this is a tough one. Do you normally drive Zoe home? If not then her parents are right to be annoyed. If that\u2019s your normal routine then it\u2019s not that big of a deal. However, as a parent I would want to know if my child was distraught & potentially needed my help. I think you meant well but I can see where there might be a disconnect. \n\nNAH\n\neta \u2014 I think you can probably answer this question yourself. Would you normally contact Zoe\u2019s parents of any kind of change in scheduling? Or do you communicate only with Zoe?", "INFO:  do you have permission to drive your students around in your car?", "NTA\nYes you probably should have contacted beforehand to confirm that they were home and inform them that you would drop her off... \n\nI'm a little concerned for her though... Doesn't sound like good parents...", "NTA. The girl lost her cat, the parents should be consoling her instead of giving you grief for having empathy", "NTA.\n\nUnless you need the money desperately just politely drop them as clients. As someone who has clients in a professional setting I can tell you people like these will always be a nightmare. Not worth the headache.", "NTA, you are an amazing person. The parents should not mad at you for putting their daughters mental health first. You did a good thing by letting her have the time to relax and mourn instead of making her do work and stuff. Good job", "NTA and you showed great kindness to your student.  The only think you need to \"think about\" is if you want to keep putting up with Zoe's wacko parents.", "NTA. You cannot teach someone who is crying and grieving their pet. How callous of the parents", "NTA. She was never going to learn when she was so upset. If her parents thought about it logically for even one minute they would realise that you could have just charged them for a wasted hour, but you didn't. You're a kind person, keep it up.", "NAH. I imagine they're mostly upset about her being in a car with someone without their permission, which is fair. Although, I think they should be more grateful that you care so much about their daughter's well-being. I doubt that session would have been very productive, so you basically saved them money.", "NTA Makes me feel sad for the daughter.  IMO, it was your call.  While they are the ones that are paying, they're not your parents either.  You have complete autonomy in deciding if your student is able to do the work or not.  Unless concerns were made prior, you are the professional and your judgement should be what stands.", "NAH\n\nYou're NTA for being compassionate, but you should have cleared it with the parents first - *they're* the ones who hired you, *any* change to how/when you work needs to go through them", "NTA\n\nThey're idiots.  There's no sense in trying to tutor a crying child.  It's your call to end the session.  You have no compassionate obligation to try to calm them down and get them to learn in that state.", "NTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t need their permission to cancel a session.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t feel you were capable of providing proper tutoring for some reason you wouldn\u2019t ask them permission to cancel a session, you\u2019d simply tell them.\n\nThis is the same.", "NTA. I wonder what they were doing at home that they didn't want her to know about?", "Do you usually drive her home? I might be uncomfortable with you deciding that was okay as an adult tutor without checking with me first.  Moreso if you were male, to be honest, but still. They\u2019re having her meet you in a public place and you just changed it without notice to a private space. It probably threw them.\n\nJust tell them you\u2019ll be sure to inform them in the future, and let it go. NAH", "NTA, parents are stupid. In those kind of cases what I do: grieving, weird feeling at school, etc. I make the hour with the child and talk with them. I\u2019m not tutoring children anymore but I always thought it is as important as a lesson to listen to them.\n\nAs a tutor you\u2019re often the man in the middle: too old to be a friend, too young to be a parent and, they enjoy small talks with an adult that has a different point of view. The parents don\u2019t need to know the extent of your lesson and how you do your job, as long as the student is learning.\nAnd sometime a 30mn talk will bring them peace they couldn\u2019t have find elsewhere. You\u2019re not grooming Zoe by listening to her, you\u2019re just listening. You can then talk with the parents and tell them you talked with her, you don\u2019t want to ask for full price as you didn\u2019t only did math or whatever reason you can find.\n\nIf they fire you, their lost, as you showed kindness and good maths competences.

If the parents can't see it from a viewpoint of compassion, I think you could consider it part of your role to judge whether a student will be able to participate in a session efficiently, and if not, cancel.\n\nNot overstepping can be subjective and complex but idk. In school teachers have been known to excuse students who are struggling from certain activities and I kinda see this in the same light.", "Were the parents snorting cocaine off the ass of a hooker or spouse swapping with the neighbors when you dropped her off?\n\nIn all seriousness as a parent I can scarcely imagine being mad if someone brought my kid home when they were inconsolable, unless you dropped her off on the doorstep and didn't see that she could actually get in.\n\nSounds like a wild overreaction to me, and at your next session I would let Zoe know your sessions will be coming to an end soon because you need clients who aren't taking a tone with you and threatening to fire you for just trying to help their child when she's obviously upset.  And do that - find a replacement client and then bring this one to closure, these folks clearly do not appreciate the care you have shown at all.\n\nNTA", "These parents have the sympathy of a turnip.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nWhen I was 15, I was tutor for other kids. \nWith 15 she is old enough to not inform her parents about every step she is doing.

You shouldn\u2019t drive kids around who you don\u2019t normally drive. You really need to make sure you have a parent\u2019s permission for that. I\u2019d also make sure you contact parents too for changes in the schedule. Just a heads up sort of thing.", "NTA so easily and I think the point alot of people are glossing over is that the cat died BEFORE school. The parents knew it was dead, their daughter would obviously be upset and they sent her to school with tutoring. If you called to ask permission it sounds like you were going to get some variation of \"she needs to toughen up and school is more important than her little feelings\" I would definitely call to inform them next time and let her walk as normal(if they insist) but bless your heart for not enforcing this poor girls suffering.", "Nta, it's not up to them if it gets cancelled and I'd let them know that heavily because this is your time you're taking for them! They are majorly overstepping and I hope you put them in your place and tell them you wont tutor anymore if they make demands like this specific one.", "NTA. Chances are that she wouldn't have gotten much learning done anyway. Her parents sound like control freaks though.", "Except if those heartless parents normally pick their daughter up from tutoring & now they have no idea where she is or why she needed to go home. If my kid is that upset please give me (their parent) the opportunity to help them before you make unilateral decisions for my kids.", "OP, maybe let them know that you enjoy tutoring their daughter and when they have apologized to you for their inappropriate reaction you look forward to resuming sessions.\nNTA.", "Does your therapist drive your child home without informing you of a change in schedule?

The daughter may very well make her own way home.", "If your kid's pet died you should already be aware if they're upset and cancel tutoring yourself and give them a chance to grieve and recuperate.", "Must admit, I do the driving for my kid.

Thank you for letting me know, be right there to pick them up.", "This was a lapse in judgment for OP.

You're right, she should have made a phone call.  But on the same token, I wouldn't have sent my kid to tutoring or therapy on the day their pet died.  I would have contacted the tutor during the day and explain and cancel.\n\nI'm seeing both sides of the story here.  Yes, OP should have made the call.  Also, yes, the parents are over reacting.  And yes, everyone in this situation should be flexible.  Parents aren't flexible.  Their response should have been \"can you please at least phone us if tutoring is cancelled or finishes early for whatever reason\".", "I feel like the parents would've said that if they cared..", "That\u2019s my biggest issue here... she \u201cfound her cat before school\u201d... there\u2019s no information here that says parents knew she was so upset. At the very least that\u2019s a phone call to let parents know. Maybe they would like to have that information. As the parents said the money wasn\u2019t the issue, the lesson wasn\u2019t the issue, it was why didn\u2019t you let us know you were driving her home & had to cancel the lesson. That\u2019s a fair question imo", ">she \u201cfound her cat before school\u201d... there\u2019s no information here that says parents knew she was so upset.\n\nAnd we will never know.  OP may not know.  I have two boys, but know girls this age (Mum here, going by my own experience) are emotional and finding a much loved pet dead is pretty traumatic.", "There\u2019s a lot of things we don\u2019t know but everyone is \u201cassuming\u201d these parents just ignored how their daughter felt & just want her to get a tutoring lesson. \n\nI am seeing this very differently... I have 4 kids (now grown) & we understand how devastating it is when a pet dies... if my kids arrived at school upset & their teacher decided to drive them home in her car without my knowledge I would be not a happy mama. OP shouldn\u2019t have made this decision without speaking to Zoe\u2019s parents. Parents get the opportunity to decide what is best for their kids. \n\nOP\u2019s question however is easily resolved... if she normally speaks to Zoe\u2019s parents regarding any scheduling changes then she should\u2019ve made the call. If Zoe manages her own schedule then it was just a lapse in judgment to protect herself from liability.", "NTA, but there\u2019s a strong chance that her parents were expecting to have an hour alone at home to themselves, so dropping her off without warning them could have left them in a somewhat compromising position.", "NTA, these parents are heartless!  I would be so appreciative of someone showing my kid such compassion, in all likelihood they reacted the way they did because they\u2019re embarrassed they sent their kid on to have a normal day while devastated.", "You, in your job as instructor, determined that the session should be canceled.  If they are questioning your judgment, they shouldn't hire you.  I'd move on to other clients.  You didn't need their 'permission ' to make that decision.", "nta", "NTA.\n\nWhile I'm sure Zoe is a great person... The second her parent's said \" They said they wouldn't fire me this time because\" I would told them THEIR fired.  Let them find another tutor at a higher price. \n\nUnless you absolutely can't live without the money, why would you ever allow someone to abuse you like that? They've clearly made it clear they need you more then you need them.", "NTA", "Info: what specifically were the parents upset about? You cancelling the session; you driving their child home; that you did one or both without notifying them; or that you did one or both without expressly getting their permission first? \n\nCause I can see that they'd be upset over two and three, but one and four seem overbearing. Stuff happens and you were trying to be compassionate."]}
