I have 4 kids (now grown) & we understand how devastating it is when a pet dies... if my kids arrived at school upset & their teacher decided to drive them home in her car without my knowledge I would be not a happy mama.

You cancelling the session; you driving their child home; that you did one or both without notifying them; or that you did one or both without expressly getting their permission first? \n\nCause I can see that they'd be upset over two and three, but one and four seem overbearing. Stuff happens and you were trying to be compassionate.", "YTA, not to Zoe but to yourself. You put yourself in a position to be alone with a minor, which isn't great safety practice as a tutor. I worked in tutoring for years before going back to school, and one of the rules every employer I've every had enforced (large and small companies over thousands of hours of work) was that you are never to be alone with a student except in a public place (the library, a coffee shop, school). It puts a lot of risk and liability on you. If I gave a minor student a ride home I would have been fired from every company I've worked at. There's a little bit more flexibility if the student is an adult (I could work in their home without someone else present, although I always kept that to college students, not high school seniors), but I couldn't give them a ride either. In a public place you aren't responsible for the child's safety in the same way as you are when you're in a private place with that minor child, and there's very little chance that you'll be accused of something untoward. Even working with online students the company that I worked for during the pandemic wanted a parent home and the computer in a public place in the house.\n\nI've canceled sessions with students when I knew they couldn't do them for whatever reason (student is sick, distraught, completely out of it for other reasons), and I've always contacted the parent to let them know why I canceled the session, that it was my decision and I wasn't enforcing any cancellation policy charged by my company (also let my boss know when such things happened, just so everyone was on the same page, my most recent employer gave pretty wide discretion), and what the plan was for making up the time/asked what they wanted to do about the lesson based on what was going on with the child.\n\nI'd advise you not to drive a minor child again without explicit permission from the parents. It sounds like you aren't working for a company, so you don't have to worry about rules and standards that a company would hold you to, which in this situation is good. I'd advise you to think about how you want to handle this in the future and make some changes. Compassion is great, but you don't want to lose your livelihood over making calls that go against the parents. It wouldn't have hurt you to send a text saying that given Zoe's emotional state you didn't think she would get much out of tutoring today and asking the parents if they wanted you to give her a ride home. As an adult in a position with minors keep in mind that you never want to put yourself in a position where you're accused of violating the trust placed in you, especially if you might want to later be in a position where you need a license or to be bonded for something. I'm not saying that you would ever do anything to a child, but I'm saying that it's good practice to not put yourself in a position where you could be accused of such.", "NAH because your intentions were good and you were right to cancel the session, but I think your mistake was to not update the parents on their daughters whereabouts, which is what I suspect they\u2019re upset about. You should have checked it was okay to drive her in your car, and let them know to expect her home earlier. If something had happened to you both on the way home then they wouldn\u2019t have known until past her usual time home, which could be hours. That\u2019s a long time to not be sure where your teenage daughter is. \n\nI would apologise and stress that you only had her best interests at heart and would let them know in the future.
