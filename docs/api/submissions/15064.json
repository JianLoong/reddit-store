I\u2019d been living with my Grandmother for years and my bio mum had phoned for like the second time ever. She asked how I was and I started to cry so much that my grandmother had to take the phone. Bio mum was clearly worried, but I remember my grandmother\u2019s response: \u201cShe\u2019ll be just fine. This is her first failure, I cannot protect from that and I\u2019m sorry. But I will teach her that all people fail sometimes and I will work with her so that over time she will pass.\u201d \n\nShe said her (and my) goodbyes and gave me hug. Then she set about *helping me to improve, so that in time I did pass*. \n\nThat was a far more useful lesson for my future that letting me drop out. It was a lesson we all must learn eventually.

Pay to place is now being exposed everywhere as it should be.", "YTA, you ARE hurting people, including your own kids! Right now they\u2019re operating under the illusion that they\u2019re good actors, what happens when that illusion is shattered? What if they find out that you\u2019ve been bribing people to ensure they get the roles? Do THEY know that\u2019s part of the arrangement? If they don\u2019t, when they find out it\u2019s going to shake their confidence in themselves. Because what does any of it mean, if they wouldn\u2019t have it if daddy didn\u2019t buy it? What if they think they may have a shot doing this professionally? They\u2019re going to find out in a very brutal way that they\u2019re actually not that great and this potential dream was something they don\u2019t have the ability to pull off. Again, shake their confidence in themselves, and in their own abilities. Everyone is good at something, and everyone has something that they enjoy that they may not be very good at. The worst thing you can do for someone is ensure they get something they want but aren\u2019t actually qualified for, it\u2019s setting them up for failure. I am NOT saying that you should tell them they suck, and I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t still encourage them to try, but what you SHOULD have done instead of bribing their way into the lead, is spent that money on acting classes, so they can get better and EARN those lead roles. That would have been a long term investment that would have done so much more for your kids. They would learn that even though they may not be very good at something at first, if they love it, if they work hard, put in the effort to learn and get better, they can accomplish things all on their own. You ARE screwing over other kids that are more QUALIFIED for the role, you are cheating them out of something that have EARNED on their own skill and merit. So yeah, you suck, and your wife is 100% right.\nEdit: also, I promise you, to those kids and yours, it is NOT \u201cjust\u201d a community theatre!

Fucking Hugh Jackman was involved in his school theatre productions!", "YTA, way to teach your kids they can bribe their way through life I'm sure thats an excellent lesson for them.

IF they're not very good, but are being set up to believe they are, they're in for a very big surprise once daddy isn't pulling the strings.

Your wife is correct, the theatre company is essentially accepting bribes (building a wing at Yale and miraculously your kid with a 2.0 average is admitted!)  I say slight because you mean well.  You want to help your kids but seriously let them learn that being in the ensemble or smaller parts based on their talent is a way of life and a lesson they have to learn.

Let the chips fall where they may and support your kids no matter the role they get in the next production.", "NAH - To everyone saying he is setting the kids up for failure because this won\u2019t work when they are adults, this is exactly how the real world and adulthood works.

You NOT donating money isn't going to change a thing about how your community theater works - it's obviously been built around \"donations get parts.\"  Your kids very well may \"deserve\" a part in the future based on skill, but they wouldn't get it, because others who donate get it.  You choosing not to donate doesn't result in deserving kids getting parts.\n\nIt also doesn't sound like you're going to DO anything, unless I'm reading you wrong, OP. If you were to donate, then contact the director and say \"hey, just a heads up, I donated...wink wink...\" that would be an AH move.\n\nAs far as setting your kids up for failure/setting unrealistic expectations...it just doesn't sound like this community youth theater is that big a deal.  So your kid gets cast as Annie, thinks she's amazing, but isn't amazing - she goes to HS, tries out for Annie there and doesn't get it.  I can't imagine anyone in any world would come into a \"but don't you realize, I was cast as Annie at age 8!!!\" identity crisis here.\n\nBut I do understand your wife here - she's not an AH either.

She is not their mother, so she does not get a final say on how you raise your children.\n2. Her giving an ultimatum is an immature way of handling a disagreement of this nature, however large and important it is. It is saying she is so right, she has the right to, after she has listened to your best point of view, punish you for not kowtowing to her demands. That is abusive.\n3. Your town is corrupt.

Not my fault others don't make the kind of money I do for their family.\" \n\nYou are absolutely right.", "Right? \"My kids like leading roles!\" As if 99% of people in theater don't want the leads too.", "Well, obviously! They want them! And literally no one else auditioning does!", "So they aren\u2019t actually interested in acting?\n\nWhy do they do this at all then?\n\nJust for the attention ?\n\nLet the kids who actually care about acting get some of the lead roles for a while.\n\nBut keep on making generous donations to that theatre. You owe it to all the other performers you have cheated out of opportunities.", "> They're not interested in taking acting lessons.\n\nThen what the hell are we doing here?", "Wait, what? \n\n\"My kids aren't good at acting and have no interest in it, and make no effort whatsoever. But they like the prestige of having their name on the cast list as a lead actor, so I buy them the parts they want.\"\n\nThis is the sort of entitlement that is going to bite them if you don't plan to buy their way through life from now on. And I'd be amazed if they have any friends in the community theater, either. People will catch on that their roles are being bought, if they haven't already. They will be disliked and resented. Is it worth being the \"star\" if it means alienating everyone around them?\n\nYou are doing them a disservice. Do the kids know you've bought their roles for them? If they DO and aren't upset about it, you've already raised spoiled entitled kids. Someday a problem will come along they can't buy their way out of, and they'll be lost.", "They probably shouldn't be acting then; they're taking opportunities away from kids that have a genuine interest.", "Why would they be interesting in actually doing any work or improving in any way? Daddy will just pay off whoever to get them what they want, whether they earn it or not.", "When people say eat the rich they mean people like you. Not only do your kids live an extremely privileged life, you are using your money to walk around the red tape the rest of us have to and laying the brick foundation for kids who don't even like acting, yet like to take opportunities away so they can see their names in the stars!? \n\nYou and your kids are severely entitled and are chasing attention and clout and you want to feed that void? Imagine having all that money and you can't raise anything, kids crying because they don't get the lead roles in a hobby they suck at and don't care about.", "YTA and a terrible parent.", "Hope you\u2019ve got enough money to buy their futures for them!", "Why are you taking opportunities away from kids who aren\u2019t spoiled, and who work hard to get the roles? YTA all day.", "If they have no interest in actually improving themselves for this hobby that they supposedly love then what's the point of the donation bribes? Or is it they're under the very *very* false impression that since they've been getting lead roles they're good at acting and don't need lessons?", "Exactly. Because it\u2019s a lot more expensive to buy them into college or jobs."]}
