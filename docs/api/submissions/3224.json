{"id": 3224, "submission_id": "z4jbtp", "title": "WIBTA if I skipped my In-Laws Xmas party?", "selftext": "Honestly in need of advice.\n\nIts basically what the title says. I (31M) have been with my wife (30F) for 14 years, married for 6. My In-laws host a party every holiday season, usually the weekend before Xmas, and this year, I feel it would be best if I just sat this one out. The reason is my father in law (56M). He, for whatever reason, hates me. Has since I met him. While my wife and I were dating, he was somewhat civil, even though he judged EVERYTHING I did. In the begining, I was a teen talking to his daughter, so I thought I got it. But as we grew together, it just got worse. He went from being the gruff dad not trusting a teen boy, to openly hostile despite how happy my wife is.\n\nIt came to a serious breaking point this past week. My wife came to me and immediately I could tell she was really upset about something she had to tell me. Apparently, her father had given a coworker my wifes phone number, trying to set them up on a date. The coworker had texted my wife, basically trying to set a meet up, and my wife came straight to me with the message, confirmed by the time stamp on the text that it had barely been a minute since she received it. After she told me she had no clue how he had gotten her number, I called him and straight out asked what his deal was. He was EXTREMELY apologetic and embarrased, and told us that my FIL had given him my wifes number, said she was a soon to be divorcee, and was \"looking to get back out there\". I was PISSED, as was my wife. She called her father in front of me and lost her mind, asking what his problem was. I remained silent as she spoke to him, and he flat out said \"I'm just looking out for your best interest. You deserve so much better\".\n\nAfter telling him off, she hung up and we had a long talk about how she feels and reassured me that her fathers opinion is not her own. That she is happy and has not a single thought about leaving me. She hasn't spoken to her father since, but its only been a week. She even hung up again yesterday when her mom tried to pass him the phone for the Thanksgiving phone call. \n\nThat brings us to today. My MIL called this morning to ask if we were still coming after all the issues. It was quite clear in the conversation that she really wants us there, and I know my wife would hate to miss the party as it has been a tradition for most of her life. I am just painfully uncomfortable going. I have no issue with my wife going of course. I spoke to her about it, and though she understands my feelings about keeping my distance for a while, she said she would be disappointed not having me there and that my MIL would also be upset if I didn't attend. She said she would respect my choice, but I don't want to upset her or my MIL. But to very honest, I am still REALLY angry and I am not sure I would be able to bite my tongue this time if he pulls his usual garbage. And I'm fairly certain a blow up fight at this party would upset them more than my absense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo WIBTA if I just sat this party out?", "created_utc": 1669398209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4jbtp/wibta_if_i_skipped_my_inlaws_xmas_party/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's really sad that you've been together for so long and it hasn't already been dealt with", "If you don't go and your wife does, your FIL won, he gets her without you.\n\nThe best consequence for him would be if your wife didn't go either.\n\nAsk your wife for a compromise. If you go, she has to make an announcement to the party. \"Everybody, I'm happily married. Dad's been trying to find me new boyfriends, but I'm not a cheater. So, just ignore him!\"", "YWNBTA.\n\nUntil your father-in-law apologizes to each of you, the only proper course of action is for you and your wife to sit this one out. \n\nI say this because by going without you, your wife is both playing into his hands and letting him get away with it.\n\nI\u2019d rethink going only if he is not at the party.", "NTA whatsoever. However, there is one thing I wonder.  I really don't like the idea she is still going and you're not.  In a way, that's kind of letting him win.  It is what he wants.\n\nI think the problem here is with your wife. I understand that she told him off. However, I really question if the right answer is her going to the party without you and leaving you home. No doubt, she is in a tough spot since she wants to see her mom.\n\nIdeally, your wife doesn't go and tells her mother that she won't have a holiday meal under circumstances where her husband isn't welcome. However, I'm also leery of pressuring her to not go.  It is iffy, but I'd tell her that you don't think it is right that she's going to their holiday thing after he disrespected your marriage like that.  Just telling him off isn't enough.\n\nHowever, if she really must go, if it were me--and I don't know if this is a good, bad or terrible answer--I'd go and be outright belligerent to the FIL.", "NTA but your wife should absolutely not be going either. He will see her coming alone as a sign things aren\u2019t right between you. She should call her Mom and let her know neither of you will attend anything he is present for. You can meet you MIL for coffee if she\u2019s supportive but neither of you should see FIL until he crawls back after getting therapy.", "Just the fact that your wife is considering going to the party is deserving of couples counseling. She is totally rug sweeping her father's behavior and allowing it to happen by refusing to draw boundaries with him. Her enabling of her father's treatment of you is not okay.\n\nNTA. You definitely should not attend. And if your wife does...consider it an incredibly bad sign for your marriage.", "NTA\n\nAnd your wife shouldn\u2019t go either. She needs to tell her father this isn\u2019t OK. If he won\u2019t accept that you are her husband he\u2019s not accepting her and she sent want to be and someone that will so rudely insult and disrespect her spouse. \n\nYour FIL is a major AH. Bad enough not liking you, but lying to people about the state of your marriage and trying to set your wife up on dates?  How the hell is your wife even considering being part of a family gathering with that sort of toxicity?\n\nYour wife telling him off and hanging up on him is a god sign. Now she needs to support you not going to Christmas and stay home and celebrate with you sending a clear message to her toxic father.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re making the wise choice to keep your distance and your sanity. If your wife and MIL are disappointed, they can take it up with FIL.", "Your wife should go to the party and so should you. And you should bring along an older single gentleman with you. Have him hit on your MIL. Also bring divorce papers - REAL divorce papers with your wife's parents' names on them. Bring a pen. Tell MIL she deserves so much better.\n\nMake reservations at a restaurant that night so you don't go hungry when you get kicked out.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but if you don't go then they succeed at isolating your wife. Go, stand your ground and control your temper.", "NTA...\nAlso...imo your wife should also skip the Christmas party this year...why would she go~if she goes to the party she isn't showing her father how upset she is with his ridiculousness. At some point your FILaw needs to except you as a SIlaw...and quit playing these games.", "NTA but I agree you should both go, or none at all. It\u2019s important to make sure everyone knows you\u2019re solid together. Also, you can be extra cold to that piece of work that is your FIL. He needs to get tested for a number of mental illnesses I think\u2026", "NTA. What the fuck? No. Why would you go or ever see that person again before they apologized profusely at a bare minimum. Have some self respect. Your wife should and your MIL should as well but I don't blame them, takes a while to get away from a toxic asshole like your FIL is.", "NTA and honestly your wife would be if she attends. I understand she doesnt agree with his choices, i know shes also bothered and hurt but its a slap in the face to after what he did. By attending she is saying that she can still accept him in her life even though he massively disrespected you, her and your entire marriage.", "NTA. In fact, I would recommend you both sit this out and go NC. What a horrible thing to do.", "Nta, at all.", "NTA but wow is your FIL. That is completely unacceptable behaviour on his part and he should be ashamed of himself. Honestly I would be mad if my SO went to the party after that, but that\u2019s just me. That\u2019s honestly NC worthy in my opinion. \n\nINFO: has anyone ever sat down with FIL to find out what the heck his problem is with you? This should be facilitated by MIL and wife obviously. If I was your wife I\u2019d be finding out *exactly* what my dad takes issue with you for and work toward a resolution. Did you do something when you were teens that he just can\u2019t get over or something? Either way, trying to set his daughter up is a gross overstep, but just curious.", "No you WNBTA if you skip it.  But think of it this way,  if you decide not to go you're letting your FIL win.  If you decide to go, be the bigger person.  Don't say anything to FIL past hello, goodbye and Merry Christmas....but have fun with your wife and MIL and party the night away.  You would show FIL just how much he doesn't matter and that he can't ruin your relationship or holiday.  \n\n\nJust some food for thought.", "NTA.   But you should both go or both stay home.  Nothing would  make FIIL happier than to see her  and not you.\n\nMaybe someone can talk some sense into him  if you guys skip a few holidays", "NTA\n\n\nTell your wife that she needs to prioritize you, your feelings and marriage ahead of her poor mommy's feelings.  That you aren't guilting her for still wanting to celebrate with her parents after what he did, so she shouldn't be trying to make you feel guilty for not wanting to be around her father. You have put up with his BS for years and what he did, can't and won't be pushed under the rug.", "NTA and your wife is based af. Your father in law is way out of line and I think having an honest heart to heart about how this hurt you with your MIL and if your MIL has anyone to blame she can blame your FIL. this is the clearest case of NTA I've seen today.", "NTA, but your FIL is. I can understand your not wanting to go, but it sounds like your wife may need your support.", "NTA, but your FIL is a piece of work. I think it\u2019s valid that you don\u2019t go to Christmas at their house, but at the same time, I think you should go with your wife and show you\u2019re a United front.", "NTA \n\nYou know your self well enough to know that you may lose it on FIL and you made a decision not to go.\n\nI think that is a good decision.  \n\nFIL will probably take it as a sign that your wife is upset with you or something and give someone else her number. \n\nBut your wife can handle her father.   \n\nMaybe give your MIL a call and give her a heads up that you're not going because of what FIL did.", "<<I don't want to upset her or my MIL.>>\n\nYou have to choose, then. Go to the party or upset your wife/MIL. That's about it. I don't really see a conflict to judge though.\n\nIf your FIL has detested you for 14 years, to the point of pulling this stunt after 6 years of marriage, then surely there is more to this story than what you're saying here. You need to discuss that with your wife more than just skip a party.", "Oh OP NTA at all. Sit this one out especially if you feel like a physical altercation could break out. And by the way I don\u2019t blame you for thinking that it could. Sounds like wife is still on your side even if she would be disappointed. I\u2019d let her know if you went, you feel you wouldn\u2019t be able to keep a lid on your anger and it could make things much worse so you\u2019ll be calming down at home.", "N T A and you're being smart by preventing further drama.  This is disgusting and weird for a father to do.", "NTA at all. You are extremely open-minded to not be angry at your wife if she goes. Your father-in-law was disrespectful to you and your marriage. \n\nI would want proof that your FIL will respect your marriage, and that proof will take time. FIL will see your wife\u2019s attending the party as a sign that he can do something so egregious and be forgiven without demonstrating that he is truly sorry and will never do anything like this again.", "WNBTA. Talk about it more with your wife. Her dad crossed a serious line. I understand her wanting to go and you go with her. If you don\u2019t go her dad could turn it into marriage problems. If you do go then your wife has to be prepared for a possible huge confrontation.", "You would NOT BTA. Good for you having a wife who will stick up for you. I understand wanting to continue family traditions, I have a few of my own I really want to keep going, but no one should be expected to visit family who has been so openly disrespectful to them for years.\n\nINFO: what do you think he hates so much about you? Are you a different race or religion? Not want kids? Have family he doesn't like? Do something bad in the past? This amount of hate seems like it should have a reason \ud83d\udc40", "What kind of a wife would go to a holiday celebration with a person actively trying to ruin her marriage.", "NTA. Please listen to most of the responses here about how toxic your in laws are. Also agree with others that your wife should stand up for you.", "NTA, but do show up. and put him on full blast. Make sure EVERYONE is aware of the petty childish BS this guy is pulling trying to actually break you and your wife up., and tell them if it continues. They wont have any communication with you or your wife. or future kids (if any)  \n\n\nOF COURSE discuss this scenario with her first. It's time you man up, and put your foot down. HE CROSSED A LINE. and if he's willing to pull this petty crap. How are you certain he isnt gonna set you up so your wife thinks you're cheating on her. And you damn well better bring this up to the wife too.", "NTA whatever you decide. Have a heart to heart with FIL before Christmas and say everything that you have to say.  You are understandably angry.  I wouldn't let that AH separate me from the holiday activities with my family.  He will always be your FIL and you likely can't avoid him forever.\n\nReddit loves to tell people to go No Contact, but it isn't as easy as it sounds.  I've done it and know people who have.  Low Contact was much easier for me.  My spouse knows that if I say, \"it's time to leave\", we just leave from my parents' house.  No questions asked, just pack up and go.

She is telling her father that he can keep doing this and that he will eventually get you two divorced", "I agree with everything here, but I was thinking taking MIL out to dinner, or to an event she'd like.  It's gonna suck for your (OP's) wife to miss this, but if she is serious about your marriage, the two of you have to be united, or FIL will take it as a win.\n\nChange of tangent:\n\n> He, for whatever reason, hates me. Has since I met him. While my wife and I were dating, he was somewhat civil, even though he judged EVERYTHING I did. In the begining, I was a teen talking to his daughter, so I thought I got it. But as we grew together, it just got worse. He went from being the gruff dad not trusting a teen boy, to openly hostile despite how happy my wife is.\n\nOP, this and other subreddits have the phrase \"Missing Missing Reasons\", usually it's about parents who claim they don't understand why their kids break off contact, but it can apply to other relationships.  It might not hurt for you and your wife to really look at what his reasons might be.  Has she asked him for specifics when he says that she can do better?  Since you are not the only person affected by this, I think an honest attempt to reconcile, would be good for everyone.  Also, do you have kids, are you planning/trying, or are you childfree?  If you and your wife are childfree, that might be part of it, many parents don't like it when they don't have grandchildren.", "Assert dominance. I love this!", "I like how you petty.", "And make sure you retell the HILARIOUS story of FIL giving out his daughter\u2019s number to other men loud and often. Tell it like it\u2019s the funniest story you\u2019ve ever heard. Make sure he\u2019s in the vicinity every time you tell it. Draw him into the group and clap him on the back if he\u2019s near enough. \n\nSeriously tho, NTA. And your wife is essentially allowing his behaviour by giving no real consequences for it. She should be mad enough that she doesn\u2019t WANT to go to the party tbh.", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
