The most important part of any relationship is trust, and you obliterated any trust he had in you. This is something you share on your 1st date.", "YTA. You did deceive him. You kept an extremely big piece of yourself from him. \n\nI\u2019m curious. What\u2019s your plan with your daughter? Will she eventually come to live with you? Or does your sister have full custody?", "YTA - a lie of omission is still a lie, and he\u2019s probably pissed about that and when you finally did tell him, it likely revealed things about your character that he didn\u2019t like.", "YTA! Why hide that from him.\nIf I was dating some guy for 10 months & then told me he had a child I would most likely call it off.

You deliberately kept it from him.", "YTA. You have been lying to your boyfriend for almost a year and basically ignoring your daughter for more than a decade.", "Yes, YTA. That's a pretty big fucking thing to leave out. \n\nHonestly, you hiding this would show be that there is no way I could trust you to be honest and open moving forward. \n\nBeing in a relationship means being able to talk about uncomfortable things without judgement.

OP was forced to give birth. Forced to carry for 9 months and go through labor. That\u2019s traumatic.

There is your reason why you are TA.", "YTA of course. And if you were a real liar you could've just told him she was your niece since no one in Bolivia speaks English so you aren't even a clever liar!", "YTA - you should have brought this up early on and just explain the situation. What happens if your daughter wants to move out of Bolivia? What if she just wants to reach out when she\u2019s older?", "YTA. He has every right to be pissed off. That\u2019s information you share at the beginning, not 10 months later when you\u2019re planning to go there.", "Yeah, YTA here for sure. I would want to know if a woman I dated had abandoned a child. I feel like it might speak to their character.", "YTA. \n\n10 months is a LONG time to keep this info from someone. Even if you rarely see her, you still have a child that you hid.", "YTA...you're a piece of work....seriously. I hope you're boyfriend moves on. Because you're not able to be a mother. You're answers show a lack of maturity that is mind-blowing. \n\nYou're poor daughter...but maybe she is better of without you.", "YTA. You\u2019ve been with him for 10 months and you still never told him you have a kid even though she lives in another country. That\u2019s pretty messed up and I don\u2019t blame him for being super pissed. I would be pretty livid if a guy I was dating hid that from me for almost a year and only told me because we were going back to his home country where we would see said kid. Seems like you only told him the truth because you had to, not because you were being honest.", "YTA. Wtf with you? How is it possible that you think that you are not an AH?", "Yeah kinda TA here, he\u2019s allowed to be annoyed at you for hiding something that big from him", "YTA; I'm a single parent and I know about protecting your children. I always let guys know up front I have a child, but I never let them meet unless I know they are serious about the role they'd be agreeing to. *Surprise* they usually run. But yeah hiding your abandoned child would piss me off too.", "YTA\u2026 that\u2019s huge information you left out", "YTA. You should have told him this sooner.", "YTA, thats too long to have not brought up your child.", "INFO: how old are you?", "YTA. You haven\u2019t told him about your kid after ten months?! You deserve to get dumped.", "Absolutely the AH.", "Yeah you should have told him. YTA", "I placed a child for adoption 21 years ago. It has always got brought up in serious romantic relationships, not in a traumatic, earth shattering life experience, but just as a factual event that occured in my life. Thankfully I have been pretty open about it with my (now ex) husband, kids and current husband as I was lucky that he wanted to meet a couple years ago so I didn't have a big secret I needed to tell everyone. My other kids were excited to meet him and we still stay in touch. He was/is not a dirty, little secret and even though we didn't have contact (or ever know if we even would) I was still open with my close loved ones exactly for the reasons you described above.

You did deceive him", "YTA - you deserve to be alone, this man and your child are both better off without you", "YTA for abandoning a child, then lying about it.

But you're basically involved in an open adoption situation.  You're not raising her.  That is something you share with a person you trust. Is 10 months long enough to create that level of trust? Maybe, maybe not.  In our society, giving birth to a child while not married and giving it to someone else to raise is always considered shameful, so of course you would hesitate to share that.\n\nOTOH, your boyfriend sees this as what it is - you didn't trust him with the information.  That's hurtful.  He has every right to be upset.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand why everyone is shaming this OP. She got pregnant, she gave up the child for adoption. Isn't that supposed to be a valid option? Isn't that what the pro-lifers are all screaming for? That isn't abandonment!\n\nWould you all be screaming at her if she had just aborted the child like she probably wanted to?
