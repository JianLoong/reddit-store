My niece was born in October and my son was born in November. I was in the hospital for three weeks prior to my son's birth because of complications related to my pregnancy. Viv and I are not close. She annoys the ever loving crap out of me most of the time. My younger sister Darcey (26F) and I are super close though. But Viv and Darcey are not close.\n\nSo according to Viv she announced her daughter's name was Agnes Kathleen and had most people give very generic comments on the name. She said Darcey didn't say anything at all when she went with our parents to see the baby. I didn't get to meet my niece until everyone came to meet my son because I couldn't leave the hospital.\n\nWhen we announced our son's name was Cove we did get some compliments on the name. Darcey and my dad loved the name and were cooing over it being \"super nice but different\" to quote Darcey. We told our families first when they visited and once they all knew my husband announced it on social media.\n\nThat's where Viv seems to have been really set off because a few days after I got home from the hospital Viv called to complain that I got more enthusiasm for my son's name than she did for her daughter's. She asked why I had to give my son a weird name and told me it was dumb. I told her I didn't have the energy to deal with her.\n\nMy husband also got a text from my sister. He went through all the social media comments and most of them were \"love the name/sweet name and congrats!\". It's not like people were tripping over themselves saying we chose the best name ever. He couldn't find her post so he assumed she deleted it. But he told me he wasn't sure what got her so bent out of shape.\n\nIn the last month it has been crazy how much of a grudge Viv holds against me. She went on to blame me for Darcey and dad liking my son's name more and for getting a better response online. She was pretty furious with me actually and a few days ago I told her she can't be mad at me for other people's reactions. And I pointed out that it's very much what she's doing. She told me I should be more understanding and fuck me, etc.\n\nIt's exhausting and saying that to her only set her off more on me. I just don't have the energy for this but now I wonder if I shouldn't have said that to her.

My niece was born in October and my son was born in November. I was in the hospital for three weeks prior to my son's birth because of complications related to my pregnancy. Viv and I are not close. She annoys the ever loving crap out of me most of the time. My younger sister Darcey (26F) and I are super close though. But Viv and Darcey are not close.\n\nSo according to Viv she announced her daughter's name was Agnes Kathleen and had most people give very generic comments on the name. She said Darcey didn't say anything at all when she went with our parents to see the baby. I didn't get to meet my niece until everyone came to meet my son because I couldn't leave the hospital.\n\nWhen we announced our son's name was Cove we did get some compliments on the name. Darcey and my dad loved the name and were cooing over it being \"super nice but different\" to quote Darcey. We told our families first when they visited and once they all knew my husband announced it on social media.\n\nThat's where Viv seems to have been really set off because a few days after I got home from the hospital Viv called to complain that I got more enthusiasm for my son's name than she did for her daughter's. She asked why I had to give my son a weird name and told me it was dumb. I told her I didn't have the energy to deal with her.\n\nMy husband also got a text from my sister. He went through all the social media comments and most of them were \"love the name/sweet name and congrats!\". It's not like people were tripping over themselves saying we chose the best name ever. He couldn't find her post so he assumed she deleted it. But he told me he wasn't sure what got her so bent out of shape.\n\nIn the last month it has been crazy how much of a grudge Viv holds against me. She went on to blame me for Darcey and dad liking my son's name more and for getting a better response online. She was pretty furious with me actually and a few days ago I told her she can't be mad at me for other people's reactions. And I pointed out that it's very much what she's doing. She told me I should be more understanding and fuck me, etc.\n\nIt's exhausting and saying that to her only set her off more on me. I just don't have the energy for this but now I wonder if I shouldn't have said that to her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
