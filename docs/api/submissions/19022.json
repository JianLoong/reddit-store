We have a pretty big friend group and ofc bigger friend groups are just smaller friend groups all in one circle. We mainly hung out downtown and there\u2019s a little shopping plaza there as well so my girlfriend decided to go shopping with some of our friends.\n\nSo after a long day in the city, we decided to just chill at this park. My girl and I were just talking about our day and whatnot and she decided to show me some stuff she got while her and a couple of our friends went shopping. She got the same dress she was wearing but in black. It was a bit warm but it was gonna get colder so my girlfriend decided to wear this long sleeve dress that was fitted. I really like this dress on her. She looks so beautiful in it and I\u2019m not saying she only looks beautiful when she wears it - she looks beautiful in everything of course. I don\u2019t force her to wear clothes like that on the daily nor do I wish for her to wear clothes like that. She can wear anything she wants because frankly it\u2019s none of my business what she wears lol. I just wanted to make this clear before anyone gets the wrong idea. \n\nI told her how pretty she would look in the new dress she bought because she already looks so beautiful in the current dress she was wearing; I was basically just flirting with her because she is my girlfriend, she flirts back and blah blah blah we\u2019re just being a normal couple. I don\u2019t think she felt uncomfortable by my comments and I hope she didn\u2019t. \n\nNow, this is where I may be the asshole. \n\nWe decided to go get dinner at this pizza place and since we live in a walkable city, we just walked there. My girlfriend was walking with one of our friends and this was when my best friend (F20) came up to me and told me she overheard what I said to my girlfriend and I thought she was gonna make fun of me but instead she was telling me off for speaking to her like that and that I was objectifying her. I asked her how and she just explained to me how basically me liking the dress she was wearing equals objectification. I told her it wasn\u2019t that deep and just brushed it off. And now she\u2019s subtweeting about\nstraight men seeing their girlfriends as nothing but objects or whatever.\n\nNow I\u2019m starting to think about it and I don\u2019t see her as an object or anything like that. She is the person I love and in a loving relationship with, I just happen to like the way she looks in the dress she was wearing today. She likes when I wear certain things/look a certain way as well and I don\u2019t feel objectified. The objectification of women is a problem in society but i don\u2019t think me flirting with my girlfriend (consensually) contributes to that.

If you were being really explicit and gross or something maybe but from what you\u2019ve said here I don\u2019t think you are the asshole. You seem like a good guy and you know it\u2019s none of your business to tell her what to wear. \n\nWhat exactly did you say? I feel like your friend has missed the subtleties on what counts as objectification and what is just a compliment!", "NTA. The words that describe your best friend are \u201ctoxic activist\u201d. \n\nWhat did your gf say when you told her about the convo? Her feelings are the important ones, not your friend\u2019s.", "Not the asshole. Your friend saw you complimenting your girlfriend and automatically assumed you were treating her like an object. And the fact that she began subtweeting about only **straight men** seeing their girlfriends as objects is disgusting", "It sounds like your friend is a dumdum and probably anyone who claims you were 'objectifying' your girlfriend by telling her she will look pretty should touch grass.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You paid your girlfriend a compliment that she didn't object to, and a busy body took offense. Frankly, I'd like to think that any partner I had would tell me I'm beautiful or look beautiful in what I'm wearing (single, hopefully forever,  by choice) but some women aren't like me. The thing is, this friend tried to force their own set of values on you and your partner,  and that's not okay. Edit to add, I'm a raging feminist, and see no problem", "Unless you're lying about your girlfriends reaction and she was clearly uncomfortable or something, you're absolutely NTA. You're allowed to find your girlfriend attractive, and tell her she looks good. If she doesn't have a problem with it, no one elses opinion is relevant. Does this friend look for reasons to be offended all the time? I know people like that, and it's exhausting.", "Okay, so listen.  You gave your gf a compliment and she took it as such.  Your friend (who should keep her thoughts to herself) took offense on behalf of women across the nation?\n\nSociety has issues that need to be addressed.  But if we take offense at every single instance of interaction that bothers us, generalizing and stereotyping each other, turning every blessed life moment into something bigger than it needs to be, then all of the voices will drown each other out and massive social issues will remain unchanged while the masses complain about everything.  Which is probably overkill.  Or maybe your friend should consider keeping her nose out of business that doesn't involve her.\n\nBut that's just my opinion.\n\nNTA, by the way.", "NTA, fuck this kind of feminism, this is just psycho", "Huh complimenting your lady is not objectifying her. What's wrong with finding her attractive? Unless you said disgusting stuff that you think are compliments.\n\nNTA.", "NTA does your gf's friend have a crush on you?", "NTA, I\u2019m completley feminist and objectification is a big problem, but this? When my boyfriend tells me he likes something on me i always feel happy and good because its just nice! And i also comment on his clothes because some stuff makes him look especially cute. \nIf you feel unsure u can also just ask your gf, im sure its an easy talk and she will confirm this:)", "NTA. This is some woke bullshit. Maybe have a word with your girlfriend and check she was ok with your comments, but generally complimenting your girlfriend is not objectification. Friend can mind her own business", "NTA but I hype up and overly compliment all gothic clothes my girl wear\u2019s because I love the style. I\u2019ve never received any comment on it", "NTA, this is the reason people are getting afraid of giving away compliments, some will take offence in anything nowadays, but don\u2019t let it stop you telling how beautiful you GF is on a daily!", "NTA. It sounds like your best friend is really out of line here. You might want to talk to your girlfriend again to make sure there is no miscommunication, like her trying to communicate just how uncomfortable it was and you missing it, but it is doubtful. Also, to insert yourself into somebody else's relationship like that requires a good reason. You complimenting your girlfriend's looks is not a good reason. That is your best friend either being jealous or having a chip on her shoulder.", "NTA. It's likely your best friend either has romantic feelings for you, or she's jealous that you have a relationship and she doesn't. Don't let her get in your head so she can try to dictate the terms of your relationship. Giving a compliment to your girlfriend, and how it makes her feel, is between you and her alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is what it\u2019s come to - flirting with the person you love and telling them they look gorgeous in a specific outfit - is objectification. \n\nJust. Wow. \n\nYour friend is so far out of her mind, it\u2019s like she and her mind exist in two diff galaxies. \n\nYou\u2019re completely NTA and for what my opinion is worth OP, keep flirting!!

I wouldn't mind at all if my bf said that to me.\n\nSounds like this friend has alot of insecurities and is channeling that into misandry, judging by how she felt the need to comment on your remark, then post a twitter rant about men.

I s your friend jealous?", "NTA.\n\"Your ass looks so hot in those shorts\" I would consider objectifying.\n\"You look beautiful with that dress\" is just a genuine compliment, and for god's sake it's your girlfriend. Your friend should piss off tbh.", "If you're not understanding, then I'm not either. Like seriously, I tell my girl when she looks good in something, I tell my friends when they look in something.", "NTA, I think your gf\u2019s friend was looking for an excuse to be offended. Maybe she has dealt with a lot of misogynists in the past and is hypersensitive. Whatever her reasons might have been there was nothing wrong with what you said.", "she showed me the dress she bought and was saying how it\u2019s been sold out for months online and it was the last one in stock at the store she went to and also a size smaller and she was feeling a bit insecure abt it not being the right size so I just told her she\u2019ll look just as beautiful in it as she looks now or something along those lines and she was very smiley lol", "That is exactly what it is.

HOWEVER, I also spend a lot of time telling my bf how cute he looks in outfits, and being told how great I look in certain things.

OP, NTA.", "Seriously for telling his gf she looks pretty in a dress????? Wtf is wrong with ppl when this makes them an A H", "right!! like, telling his gf that she looks nice in a dress is treating her like an object\u2026.? what?? i\u2019m like maybe I read it wrong haha. this is crazy", "It sounds like you were supporting your gf and boosting her self esteem! I think your friend is jealous or doesn\u2019t really understand objectification. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve experienced this! Not all people are who are feminists etc believe that and we think your friend is unreasonable! You\u2019re being a good guy and a good bf, try not to let this person get you down or bother you! \n\nIt\u2019s gross when anyone objectifies someone so seems uncool that your friend is specifically talking about straight men, I\u2019ve seen lesbians with toxic masculinity talk shit about women, maybe she is queer and likes your gf!", "Hey OP. You are very NTA and you are not objectifying your gf. You complimented her to make her feel good and pretty which helps to boost her self-esteem. You are a great bf so keep that up okay? Don't listen to your friend and keep complimenting your gf", "See, none of that is objectifying! Objectification is when a woman is reduced to a sex object; what you said wasn't sexual. If you'd said 'I like your boobs in that dress' or something, THEN it would be objectifying (but even then, it would depend on phrasing and context to some degree), but just telling her she's beautiful when she specifically says she's feeling insecure is fine. Sweet, actually!", "Based on how you speak of her, I'd genuinely be surprised if she felt the way your friend claims.", "Maybe you should drop that friend I mean if it's burdening you and she judges you over everything like complementing your gf that's just messed up bro you deserve better homie!"]}
