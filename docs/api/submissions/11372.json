(Like 1 month soon)\n\nI love my fianc\u00e9 very much, but, she has been very erratic since the wedding has been getting closer. I think she\u2019s very over stressed.\n\nIf I try to talk to her she gives me one word replies and when I ask her what\u2019s wrong she says she\u2019s just not in the mood to talk. I didn\u2019t mind it at first, but she\u2019s started doing it nearly everyday. I told her I feel a bit discarded and that I enjoy speaking to her, but she screamed at me and told me that I don\u2019t get it. I just left the issue alone.\n\nI\u2019ve started making dinner everyday, just to help her out a bit. But sometimes she gets mad at me when I don\u2019t cook something she likes for dinner. I end up having to make 2 separate dishes just to avoid an argument.\n\nOur anniversary was this past weekend, so I booked a hotel in Miami. My fianc\u00e9 was very excited about this trip and this was the first time in a while we didn\u2019t argue.\n\nThe trip was going very well, and we were having a great time. Yesterday, we went to a restaurant. We ordered our food and ate.\n\nAfter we finished eating, she ordered a drink, and so did I. It was pretty heavy so I barely drunk it because somebody still had to drive. My fianc\u00e9 on the other hand, scarfed down her whole drink and then asked me for mines. \n\nI was a little taken aback because my fianc\u00e9 barely drinks. I asked her if she was okay and she got a little mad and told me to stop asking her that. I didn\u2019t want an argument again so I let her have the drink. After she finished mine, she ordered 2 more drinks. I started to get worried so I discreetly asked the waiter for the check. \n\nShe was very angry when she realized we were leaving. I told her she had too much to drink. She denied this but when she stood up she almost fell down. I had to carry her back to the hotel because she could barely stand upright. I only got 2 hours of sleep because she spent the whole night vomiting. I was a little agitated in the morning, but I let it slide.\n\nI woke up surprised to see my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t there. I panicked and tried calling her to no avail. I thought about calling 911 when she suddenly entered the room. I asked her where she had been and she said she had went to a house party and accidentally fell asleep at the house.\n\nAt this point, I was at the end of my rope. I immediately told her to \u201cGet the fuck out.\u201d She was surprised and asked me why. I told her that she was acting out of line. I paid for another hotel room and now that\u2019s where she is staying.\n\nHer family is furious at me for not \u201ccaring for my drunk fianc\u00e9\u201d and they said they no longer give me their blessings. Turns out my fianc\u00e9 lied and said I kicked her out when she was drunk and left her alone.\n\nMaybe I did go a bit far kicking her out, but I just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I feel bad and I don\u2019t know what to do.

Postponing a wedding can be expensive but definitely cheaper than having a wedding and then a divorce. Talk with her and figure out what is going on, this story has so many unanswered questions and just \"stress about the wedding\" can't really explain why she would leave your room after vomiting for hours and you are sleeping, to go to a house party somewhere else.

I\u2019d try to clear the air with the in-laws as much as possible.  Sometimes there\u2019s only so much a person can do on that front but at the very least, make sure they know the truth.  Oh and I would also talk to her about the fact that she lied to her family about what went down.   If she felt the need to lie about her actions then that proves that she understands that what she did was wrong and she\u2019s trying to avoid accountability", "NTA\u2014 how did she come across this \u201chouse party\u201d?!", "NTA and you seriously need to consider putting your wedding on hold until you can get couples counseling.

Having lived this myself I can tell you it\u2019s not worth your time. These are red flags bro, you likely ignored many more by the way you describe how you handle her out of line behaviors. I don\u2019t wanna put this in your head but I kinda do, she might be cheating on you. Bridezillas are Bridezillas, but this is completely out of line. She wakes up at a house party? Who the fuck does she know in Miami?  What else aren\u2019t you telling us about her behavior from the past? Those are the things you need to consider. Brother, I would head for the hills and cut my losses.", "NTA, but are you sure your fiancee doesn\u2019t have a second thought on the wedding, and \u201chouse party\u201d was planned, and alcohol before was she way of working up the courage to try it before the marriage", "NTA but you would be to yourself if you marry her.", "NTA - it sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to get married and is sabotaging the relationship so that you will break up with her. That\u2019s a cowardly and shitty thing to do, but at least you\u2019re getting a chance to end it *before* you get married.", "NTA...There is obviously something bigger going on here. Personally, I would have left myself and got another room instead of kicking her out, but you're definitely in \"last straw\" territory. Please don't get married until you've solved these issues.", "NTA, the problem you should be focusing more is how your fiance treats you. You tried your very best to help her only to return with disrespect. Your fiance even stir the story and lied to her family about what happened too. She refuse to communicate with you, she refuse to respect your boundaries, rejects your concern for her well being and the fact that she went to the house party and fell asleep at that house is very suspicious.\n\nI may get downvoted for being extreme but you can't be with someone who can't help themselves if they refuse to communicate/discuss with their partner otherwise, things will become toxic overtime.", "check her phone for Tinder.\n\nYou don't find a party that you weren't looking for\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: NTA", "NTA, and I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and say she wasn\u2019t at a house party.

She might as well paint herself red at this point.\n\nRefusing to speak to you and giving one word answers and exploding when you try to ask her if she\u2019s okay, then getting mad at you for not making dinner she likes?

Ungrateful much.\n\nDrinking heavily and then getting angry when you had to leave, maybe she had a little fling that she wanted meet there and her plans got cut short.\n\nAs if that\u2019s not bad, she then leaves for a \u201chouse party\u201d in the middle of the night and then comes back and tries to brush it off? \n\nAfter that she lies to her family about what happened to try and paint you out as the bad guy.\n\nOP, read the sequence of events again. Take that ring back.\n\nOP, leave immediately, you deserve better.", "Also lied to her family so you're the bad guy. Her family said they take back their blessing, if I was you I said you could have it.

It seems like she is checked out of the relationship at this point. I really doubt she went from stumbling drunk to finding a house party in a city she doesn't live in.

But after some time (getting engaged or settling a little) the parts of them they've not wanted you to see start to come out because they don't feel they need to secure you anymore.

What house party would she know about if she doesn\u2019t know someone in Miami? Doesn\u2019t sound good", "NTA. Call off the wedding, tell her family she is lying and prepare to leave her. She is cheating.", "YTA. Maybe she is going through depression. She probably just needs help.\n\nInstead of kicking her out you should\u2019ve talked it out with her calmly. She probably feels like you are disregarding her feelings.\n\nThe sneaking out thing was suspicious sure, but maybe she made a new friend at the restaurant? You never know.", "I'm sorry, her story doesn't add up, plus she lied to her family about you to cover for herself and paint you as the bad guy.  At the very least you need to put the brakes on the wedding.\n\nYou need to tell her family exactly what happened.\n\nShe needs to come clean on what happened.  I'm sorry, a person so drunk they are vomiting doesn't just leave in the middle of the night and wander the streets till they find a house party, and if they did that is extremely worrying behavior and I wouldn't be marrying her and insisting on therapy.\n\nSomething is going on with her NTA", "Yep. This. No way", "This! \n\nOP is NTA for kicking her out. But I doubt she was at a house party. Sounds like she spent the night with someone else.", "I\u2019m assuming she left in the middle of the night when I finally fell asleep, though I assume she\u2019s lying about her whereabouts aswell.", "Right, OP says he \u201conly got two hours of sleep\u201d and she spent the \u201cwhole night vomiting\u201d so how did she leave to a whole house party and crash there without him realizing?", "Like how do you go to house party, in a city you don\u2019t live in, and \u201caccidentally\u201d fall asleep there.", "> I would have said you needed to really sit down and talk to her about what has changed in your relationship\n\nDid you miss the part where he\u2019s continuously doing that?", "OP says she did in another comment", "Right?? And it\u2019s understandable to be excited to go to Miami but leaving randomly for a house larty in the middle of the night without informing your fianc\u00e9 first? She definitely has someone on the side.", "My first thought was drugs. I have known more than one bride who started taking meth to lose weight before the wedding.", "You brought her to the hotel, she was vomiting all night,", "Exactly what I was thinking. OP, leave immediately. She\u2019s definitely cheating.", "But I thought she was up all night vomiting and therefore he couldn\u2019t sleep. How and when did she sneak out?", "Hah well I'm glad someone ran the numbers ;)", "This. She is hiding something. Something happened to her or she did something and it is messing with her head. \n\nOP, cancel the wedding A.S.A.P. Go back home. Try and talk to her. Ask her what is going on with her and do not allow her to get away with one word answers. Something is really wrong and it is better to figure it out before getting married. If she insists and refuses to open up, end the relationship. After all, whatever good relationship you had before she started acting weird is gone for now.", "Yeah NTA.\n\nWho the fuck goes to a house party *alone* when they're on vacation with their fiancee?\n\nAlso OP, DO NOT MARRY THIS PERSON.", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one that picked up on the discrepancies in the story.", "Love makes people do crazy things \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f OP definitely needs to leave", "Exactly\n\nYou received a mayor **Red Flag** prior to your wedding.\n\nTake a good look at it.\n\nYou might want to postpone your wedding and put your relation with your fianc\u00e9 (and her family...) back on track first (if you still see a future for yourself with her...).\n\nNTA", "There so many reasons she\u2019s acted this way and all of them means he should run for the hills", "I don\u2019t think kicking her out was excessive. She has already been behaving weirdly and then suddenly she goes to a \u201chouse party\u201d in the middle of the night and comes back in the morning trying to act like nothing happened? I think putting her in another hotel room for some time away was needed.", "She won\u2019t talk to him.", "OP tried to talk to her only to be screamed and yelled by his Fiance.", "She is being mentally and verbally abusive to him. Depression doesn\u2019t make people abusive.", "Maybe you should give the post a second reading.", " I suspect she slept with someone else randomly at the hotel.", "I'm assuming she went to hotel bar and hooked up. Run please or at least postpone the wedding for a year or 20.", "That is beyond sketchy. Either there's someone else or she has a drug problem but either way she's trying to hide something from you and then she takes it too far by lying to her parents to make you look bad when she's actively hiding things from everyone. I'd put off the wedding and reconsider the relationship based on her behavior and aggressive lack of communication with you.", "Middle of the night but you only got two hours of sleep? So when did you realize she wasn\u2019t there anymore?", "she was trashed, probably passed out", "It\u2019s Miami. It\u2019s not that hard to end up at a random house party. I live in South Florida, and I can tell you it happens especially if you\u2019re a woman.", "Lol seriously, just came back from Miami on my bachelorette and did not find any random house parties", "You are right. I was hoping for a talk where she wasn't avoidant, but in the end he did try.", "He should get an STD panel done while he's at it.", "OP says he only got 2 hours of sleep. She probably left as soon as he fell asleep. Two hours is a lot of time to sneak out.", "I understand your view. I think confronting the issue at the time would have been a a better path - hopefully gaining the truth\u2026 I suspect she slept with someone else randomly at the hotel.", "Right. OP stated that he tried speaking to the fianc\u00e9 but she screams at him. He needs to leave immediately.", "Thanks for pointing that back out, I probably already emptied that part from my mind by the time I was typing. Either way, serious red flags going on here. If he can't get her to talk, he needs to call off the wedding indefinitely.", "Well you don\u2019t know if she has some PTSD from a past relationship or something and that\u2019s why she\u2019s acting this way. Maybe she is afraid of commitment. And I don\u2019t think yelling at him is being abusive.", "No, I think it I read it fine.", "I fell asleep at about 4-5 am and woke up at about 6:45 ish and realized she wasn\u2019t there. Said middle of the night because it was still dark outside when I fell asleep. Sorry, should\u2019ve been more clear.", "Obviously, but I\u2019m referring to the situation as a whole\n\nETA: and I see that wasn\u2019t clear. But it was inferring about the entire situation. Not just the accidentally falling asleep part!", "Or she was fuckered out.", "Fair. I haven\u2019t been to Miami as an adult. But it\u2019s just unusual for it to happen most places. I still assume she\u2019d have to be looking for a party to find one", "Yup.  Last time I was there, I was invited back to a couple house parties after talking to people for like, 5 minutes.  Since I am not interested in being human trafficked, I declined.\n\n\nBut it definitely happens.", "NTA and you seriously need to consider putting your wedding on hold until you can get couples counseling.", "I think confronting her would\u2019ve ended in other argument. OP previously stated that whenever he tried to talk to her it ends in a screaming fight. Though, that would probably be for the best because they obviously need to break up.", "Yelling is quite literally verbal abuse. Why are you ok with siding with someone abusive who MIGHT be dealing with issues when someone right in front of you is being abused? Weird.", "I don't think justifying someone's behavior by hypothesizing that they have PTSD or depression, etc. is very helpful. The truth is, you have no idea, and OP shouldn't have to deal with being yelled at for no apparent reason just because she MIGHT be dealing with something. Even if she was, that's not an excuse for her behavior.", ">Instead of kicking her out you should\u2019ve talked it out with her calmly. She probably feels like you are disregarding her feelings.\n\n>If I try to talk to her she gives me one word replies and when I ask her what\u2019s wrong she says she\u2019s just not in the mood to talk. I didn\u2019t mind it at first, but she\u2019s started doing it nearly everyday. I told her I feel a bit discarded and that I enjoy speaking to her, but she screamed at me and told me that I don\u2019t get it. I just left the issue alone.\n\nYou seem to have missed an entire paragraph.", "So a person that has been experiencing alcohol poisoning suddenly went to a house party at 4-5am? \n\nThis still doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nAssuming any of this is true, the only thing that seems remotely possible is that she had someone else in the hotel waiting for her, but she got too drunk with you to go catch up with that person, so once she remotely sobered up, she finally went to try to \u201csmooth things over\u201d with this other person. \n\nYou are NTA at all here, but you need a better answer from your soon to be wife because her story is clearly BS.", "yeah, she definitely has some kind of commitment issue or extreme anxiety about the wedding.", "It could\u2019ve been as simple as going to the hotel bar, meeting some new people, and then getting invited back to their house. \n\nIt\u2019s simpler than you think to end up at a random house party in Miami. It\u2019s sad to say, but there are men looking for drunk women to invite back to *their* mansion.", "Yelling isn\u2019t verbal abuse. And he is not right in front of me this is reddit he is probably across the world. I am just seeing the other side of the situation, relax", "People have different experiences with mental illness depression makes simple tasks such as talking to her husband time consuming, he should\u2019ve took her to a therapist long ago but he didn\u2019t and now he\u2019s complaining cause she\u2019s tired", "Well he needs to see that she obviously has some mental issues and take her to a therapist, maybe she is too scared to ask for help", "Yeah, disappearing in an unfamiliar city intoxicated while your fianc\u00e9 is asleep is a huge red flag in and of itself. But saying you went to a house party and fell asleep there. Alarm bells would be going off in my head", "That makes sense"]}
