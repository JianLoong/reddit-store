(Like 1 month soon)\n\nI love my fianc\u00e9 very much, but, she has been very erratic since the wedding has been getting closer. I think she\u2019s very over stressed.\n\nIf I try to talk to her she gives me one word replies and when I ask her what\u2019s wrong she says she\u2019s just not in the mood to talk. I didn\u2019t mind it at first, but she\u2019s started doing it nearly everyday. I told her I feel a bit discarded and that I enjoy speaking to her, but she screamed at me and told me that I don\u2019t get it. I just left the issue alone.\n\nI\u2019ve started making dinner everyday, just to help her out a bit. But sometimes she gets mad at me when I don\u2019t cook something she likes for dinner. I end up having to make 2 separate dishes just to avoid an argument.\n\nOur anniversary was this past weekend, so I booked a hotel in Miami. My fianc\u00e9 was very excited about this trip and this was the first time in a while we didn\u2019t argue.\n\nThe trip was going very well, and we were having a great time. Yesterday, we went to a restaurant. We ordered our food and ate.\n\nAfter we finished eating, she ordered a drink, and so did I. It was pretty heavy so I barely drunk it because somebody still had to drive. My fianc\u00e9 on the other hand, scarfed down her whole drink and then asked me for mines. \n\nI was a little taken aback because my fianc\u00e9 barely drinks. I asked her if she was okay and she got a little mad and told me to stop asking her that. I didn\u2019t want an argument again so I let her have the drink. After she finished mine, she ordered 2 more drinks. I started to get worried so I discreetly asked the waiter for the check. \n\nShe was very angry when she realized we were leaving. I told her she had too much to drink. She denied this but when she stood up she almost fell down. I had to carry her back to the hotel because she could barely stand upright. I only got 2 hours of sleep because she spent the whole night vomiting. I was a little agitated in the morning, but I let it slide.\n\nI woke up surprised to see my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t there. I panicked and tried calling her to no avail. I thought about calling 911 when she suddenly entered the room. I asked her where she had been and she said she had went to a house party and accidentally fell asleep at the house.\n\nAt this point, I was at the end of my rope. I immediately told her to \u201cGet the fuck out.\u201d She was surprised and asked me why. I told her that she was acting out of line. I paid for another hotel room and now that\u2019s where she is staying.\n\nHer family is furious at me for not \u201ccaring for my drunk fianc\u00e9\u201d and they said they no longer give me their blessings. Turns out my fianc\u00e9 lied and said I kicked her out when she was drunk and left her alone.\n\nMaybe I did go a bit far kicking her out, but I just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.

Hmmm, ahn, I'm sorry in advance but have you considered that she might've cheated on you? Maybe even prior to this incident?

Postponing a wedding can be expensive but definitely cheaper than having a wedding and then a divorce. Talk with her and figure out what is going on, this story has so many unanswered questions and just \"stress about the wedding\" can't really explain why she would leave your room after vomiting for hours and you are sleeping, to go to a house party somewhere else. How did she even know there was a house party going on?", "Nta. End that relationship pal.", "NTA\n\nThere is definitly an underlying problem but you are already doing your best to comfort her and open up.  \nIn addition she lied, so she was fully aware, that what she did was a shitty thing to do in the first place.\n\nOne can only take so much and even though I think she isn't doing that stuff maliciously, she still needs that kick in the butt.", "NTA something is very wrong and you can\u2019t work on it until you and your fianc\u00e9 are able to sit down and address it.

I\u2019d try to clear the air with the in-laws as much as possible.  Sometimes there\u2019s only so much a person can do on that front but at the very least, make sure they know the truth.  Oh and I would also talk to her about the fact that she lied to her family about what went down.   If she felt the need to lie about her actions then that proves that she understands that what she did was wrong and she\u2019s trying to avoid accountability", "NTA\u2014 how did she come across this \u201chouse party\u201d?!", "NTA and you seriously need to consider putting your wedding on hold until you can get couples counseling.

You need to have a proper chat though because it sounds like she may be reconsidering getting married.

Having lived this myself I can tell you it\u2019s not worth your time. These are red flags bro, you likely ignored many more by the way you describe how you handle her out of line behaviors. I don\u2019t wanna put this in your head but I kinda do, she might be cheating on you. Bridezillas are Bridezillas, but this is completely out of line. She wakes up at a house party? Who the fuck does she know in Miami?  What else aren\u2019t you telling us about her behavior from the past? Those are the things you need to consider. Brother, I would head for the hills and cut my losses.", "NTA, but are you sure your fiancee doesn\u2019t have a second thought on the wedding, and \u201chouse party\u201d was planned, and alcohol before was she way of working up the courage to try it before the marriage", "NTA but you would be to yourself if you marry her.", "NTA - it sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to get married and is sabotaging the relationship so that you will break up with her. That\u2019s a cowardly and shitty thing to do, but at least you\u2019re getting a chance to end it *before* you get married.", "NTA...There is obviously something bigger going on here. Personally, I would have left myself and got another room instead of kicking her out, but you're definitely in \"last straw\" territory. Please don't get married until you've solved these issues.", "NTA, the problem you should be focusing more is how your fiance treats you. You tried your very best to help her only to return with disrespect. Your fiance even stir the story and lied to her family about what happened too. She refuse to communicate with you, she refuse to respect your boundaries, rejects your concern for her well being and the fact that she went to the house party and fell asleep at that house is very suspicious.\n\nI may get downvoted for being extreme but you can't be with someone who can't help themselves if they refuse to communicate/discuss with their partner otherwise, things will become toxic overtime.", "check her phone for Tinder.\n\nYou don't find a party that you weren't looking for\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: NTA", "NTA, and I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and say she wasn\u2019t at a house party.

She is even lying to her own family to make you look bad. \n\nHer behavior is very concerning.", "When did she sneak out, during the two hours you were sleeping ?", "NTA.\n\nOmg, where do I even start with all the red flags? She might as well paint herself red at this point.\n\nRefusing to speak to you and giving one word answers and exploding when you try to ask her if she\u2019s okay, then getting mad at you for not making dinner she likes? Why can\u2019t she get up and make it herself?? Ungrateful much.\n\nDrinking heavily and then getting angry when you had to leave, maybe she had a little fling that she wanted meet there and her plans got cut short.\n\nAs if that\u2019s not bad, she then leaves for a \u201chouse party\u201d in the middle of the night and then comes back and tries to brush it off? \n\nAfter that she lies to her family about what happened to try and paint you out as the bad guy.\n\nOP, read the sequence of events again. Take that ring back.\n\nOP, leave immediately, you deserve better.", "Also lied to her family so you're the bad guy. Her family said they take back their blessing, if I was you I said you could have it. Take one more chance to talk to her, if she won't talk back and explain what's going on tell her you're postponing the wedding and if that makes things explode you may want to take the ring back and walk away\n\nNta", "NTA. It seems like she is checked out of the relationship at this point. I really doubt she went from stumbling drunk to finding a house party in a city she doesn't live in.

Time to go to couples therapy and for you to take some time and evaluate if this relationship is still working, engaged or not.", "NTA, rethink if you want to marry this woman tho.

She went to a Tinder hookup, maybe even in the same hotel.", "Did anybody else catch the \u201cvery excited to go on this trip part\u201d?

She's hiding something.\n\nAlso she lied to her family concerning you kicking her out, not even a little lie, that's a big lie. Show her family the receipt for the extra room you booked to clear your name. If you're serious about marrying her you don't want them believing you're abusive, especially if she tells another lie like this in the future. It could land you with a black eye or worse.

While many brides to be get overly stressed it sounds like she may not actually be ready for the wedding / marriage. That she also misrepresented the situation to her family also is sketchy.  \n\nI\u2019d suggest couples counseling if you plan to continue to get married \u2026 however I would also suggest postponing the wedding.

Even when stressed she shouldn't be treating you like this. It sounds like your really trying and she's just throwing everything back at you. Maybe take a step back and look at how she treats you and really decide if you want to live like that. \n\nTo be honest it actually sounds like your honeymoon period is over. From my experiences I have noticed some people will act how they think you want them too and be what they think you like. But after some time (getting engaged or settling a little) the parts of them they've not wanted you to see start to come out because they don't feel they need to secure you anymore. They think \"ahh they love me and would never leave\" so they think they can act any way they want towards you. \n\nThis in itself runs deeper than just relationship issues.
