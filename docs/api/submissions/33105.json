Our parents divorced when were around 6 and our mother had a bio child (21f) with her now ex husband. We lived with our dad most of the time and I never truly connected with out \"half sister\". My brother is a great person so he tried to connect and offer brotherly support to her. My dad remarried when I was about 10 and I now consider my stepmom my mom. I don't want to get into much detail and I believe I am not allowed but my \"mother\" was not great to us, specially me, and I have no relationship with her at all. My parents never had other kids but my stepmom always said it was ok because she had the greatest kids ever.\n\nThe issue comes with my brother getting married. He talked with me and said he was going to invite everybody and that included our mother and half sister, he asked me if that would be ok or if he should not. I told him it was ok with me as long as I did not have to interact with them and he promised he would speak with them about it. They agreed and said they were very sad I still did not want to talk to them but they said it was my brother's day. \n\nI live abroad so I came for some weeks to attend all the events, my boyfriend and a friend came with me. The wedding and all the events were lovely and I kept my word of simply ignoring and not creating issues and they both did as well. Part of our maternal family was there too but I just hanged with my chosen family. \n\nThe issue came when we had a brunch after the wedding. My brother asked my parents if it would be ok if he invited some of the maternal family since it would be held on their house, they said it was up to him. During the brunch I catched our half sister trying to go into our rooms and staring at our family pics, I asked my friend to tell her to stay out of it and she seemingly did. \n\nOn the evening I got a text from a friend with a screenshot to a post she made on her IG, it said something like \"fake people with fake families\" and was a pic of our family photos, I went into her IG and saw that she had been posting stuff and she has been bashing my dad as the asshole who kept siblings apart. It turns out our mother told her my dad was a horrible man that used money to keep us away from her and he was the reason we didn't bond.... the reality is that I refused to see her because she was a horrible human being. Furthermore, she believed we were bio related so I set it straight. I am not trulxy proud about this but I made a post and commented on all her stuff that my bro and I are adopted and we have zero relation to her and that she is a petty horrible human like her mom to try and bully a good man. \n\nShe has had some backlash and went private on all SM, my brother says he is disappointed on her and reevaluating their relationship. She is blaming me and saying I am just like my dad and I should love her and support her and not take her brother away. AITA?

The grossest part of this is that your dad and stepmom were kind enough to invite this person into their home. Your half-sister then violated that kindness by invading their privacy and going into areas of your parents home that she wasn't allowed in. She took pictures and then posted them on social media and bashed your father. There are so many levels to how absolutely messed up that is. I'm amazed by the post that seem to be ignoring the fact that a 21 year old adult thought it was ok to go enter people's bedrooms without their permission when they were only invited to attend a brunch in someklse's home.", "Strictly for the purposes of AITA judgement:   \n\n\nNTA   \n\n\nYou don't need a relationship with this woman, and she had no right commenting on matters of which she had no understanding, intelligence or experience.

I would have done the same.   \n\n\nLook, even your kind hearted brother is re-evaluating her integrity and worthiness for a relationship. You owe here nothing.   \n\n\nThe reality is that she has been lied to by her mother, and instead of trying to get your side of the story she assumed the worst, instead of talking to you about it. She made it about fake internet points.   \n\n\nTalk about fake.   \n\n\nShe sowed, you reaped.", "The truth might have hurt her. But, it was certainly time she experienced it.\n\nNTA.

You did not take her brother away, her actions drove him away.  Your brother did his very best to include her and she betrayed him.\n\nSounds like your half sister needs to get away from your mother and her negative influence.

Everyone constantly airing their dirty laundry for all to see? It's so childish and narcissistic.
