I came out as gay at the age of 16 because I started a relationship with my current bf, my whole family was so supportive, my parents, my other brother and my sisters but Matt, for some reason he didn\u2019t accept me and distanced himself from me, he would ignore me at family gatherings and speak the bare minimum. \n\nMatt was married to Marina (29F) and they have a five years old adorable boy that  my family adores, a year ago my brother was caught cheating on Marina with a man, he ended up coming out and divorcing Marina, He dumped Marina right after that and my family supported him and welcomed the AP like nothing happened, the affair had been going on for years before Marina found out, Marina was deeply hurt and I felt sorry for her, I\u2019ve known Marina since I was around 8 years. \n\nMy brother and I have kinda reconciled, He apologised for distancing himself. He said he was jealous of me because I could be true to myself and he was stuck in a loveless marriage. My brother married his AP a week ago, I attended the wedding, the day before the wedding Marina had posted about how hurt and blindsided she was and how THIS (the wedding) is so wrong (nothing to see with sexuality, Marina is open-minded), the next day my brother had the nerves to post a video of their vows on social media and tag Marina and many other people and the caption read \u201cIf our love is wrong then I don\u2019t ever wanna be right\u201d. (He got this from a song by Calum Scott, \u201cIf our love is wrong\u201d)\n\nTwo days ago was my dad\u2019s birthday and we all gathered to celebrate it, and Matt started talking to us about how Marina had texted him calling him names for \u201caccidentally\u201d  tagging her, I couldn\u2019t keep it in, that was evil and I know it wasn\u2019t an accident so I told him that Marina was right he is an AH and that song wasn\u2019t to validate affairs and empower cheating partners, that he had some NERVES to try to play the victim here. He didn\u2019t say a word and left  but then my parents started telling me that I ruined the evening and I should know better since I\u2019m gay too and also that I was being homophobic and I should support him because he struggled with his sexuality his whole life. \n\nI get it, it\u2019s different for everyone, not everyone is comfortable coming out but that DOESN\u2019T give you the right to hurt someone else\u2019s feelings and he is trying to play the victim and portraying Marina as an evil, resentful ex who doesn\u2019t want him to be happy. \n\nThey think I should apologise and my whole family seems to be on his side.", "created_utc": 1675137718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pnsib/aita_for_being_homophobic/", "score": 198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t think not supporting someone \u201cfinding themself\u201d and coming out via cheating is homophobic either. Coming out and being yourself can be very hard. Based off how he treated you growing up, obviously he really struggled with his identity. It sounds like you\u2019re happy for him, but being happy someone else is happy/finally themselves doesn\u2019t mean you have to support/excuse their shitty behavior.

His cheating and blindsiding crumbled her entire world and then he had to run her nose in it all too? That's just cruel.

How do you \"favorite child\" without saying favorite child? \n\nMatt knew he was in a loveless marriage, yet never left before it turned that way. He cheated for years on his wife unapologetically.

Those are the facts.\n\nThere's being supportive of your child coming out as gay, and then there's enabling someone. Your family should put themselves in Marina's shoes and see if they would like being treated that way, and I bet you they wouldn't. It was cruel from start to finish.
