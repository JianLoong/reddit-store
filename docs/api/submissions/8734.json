I came out as gay at the age of 16 because I started a relationship with my current bf, my whole family was so supportive, my parents, my other brother and my sisters but Matt, for some reason he didn\u2019t accept me and distanced himself from me, he would ignore me at family gatherings and speak the bare minimum. \n\nMatt was married to Marina (29F) and they have a five years old adorable boy that  my family adores, a year ago my brother was caught cheating on Marina with a man, he ended up coming out and divorcing Marina, He dumped Marina right after that and my family supported him and welcomed the AP like nothing happened, the affair had been going on for years before Marina found out, Marina was deeply hurt and I felt sorry for her, I\u2019ve known Marina since I was around 8 years. \n\nMy brother and I have kinda reconciled, He apologised for distancing himself. He said he was jealous of me because I could be true to myself and he was stuck in a loveless marriage. My brother married his AP a week ago, I attended the wedding, the day before the wedding Marina had posted about how hurt and blindsided she was and how THIS (the wedding) is so wrong (nothing to see with sexuality, Marina is open-minded), the next day my brother had the nerves to post a video of their vows on social media and tag Marina and many other people and the caption read \u201cIf our love is wrong then I don\u2019t ever wanna be right\u201d. (He got this from a song by Calum Scott, \u201cIf our love is wrong\u201d)\n\nTwo days ago was my dad\u2019s birthday and we all gathered to celebrate it, and Matt started talking to us about how Marina had texted him calling him names for \u201caccidentally\u201d  tagging her, I couldn\u2019t keep it in, that was evil and I know it wasn\u2019t an accident so I told him that Marina was right he is an AH and that song wasn\u2019t to validate affairs and empower cheating partners, that he had some NERVES to try to play the victim here. He didn\u2019t say a word and left  but then my parents started telling me that I ruined the evening and I should know better since I\u2019m gay too and also that I was being homophobic and I should support him because he struggled with his sexuality his whole life. \n\nI get it, it\u2019s different for everyone, not everyone is comfortable coming out but that DOESN\u2019T give you the right to hurt someone else\u2019s feelings and he is trying to play the victim and portraying Marina as an evil, resentful ex who doesn\u2019t want him to be happy. \n\nThey think I should apologise and my whole family seems to be on his side.", "created_utc": 1675137718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pnsib/aita_for_being_homophobic/", "score": 2349, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even in very inclusive societies and families. However, the difference in my situation is that there was no cheating or living a lie.

How do you marry someone when you're unsure of your own sexuality? That just seems like the person doesn't consider marriage a big deal or is willing to marry anyone despite there not being a significant love/affection/attraction. I'm fully aware of my own sexuality and yet I'm nowhere near marriage because I don't have anyone that I love to that extent. The brother already said he was in a loveless marriage. So clearly, there were things wrong with that years ago, if not before the marriage even happened.", "How do you not understand.

Dudes an ass exactly how he presents himself to be. \n\nBisexuality and homosexuality are both same-sex loving sexualities, and are both subject to discrimination. There\u2019s no reason at all for him to receive extra sympathy for being gay or extra repercussions for being bi. \n\nAlso, after having lived a lifetime pretending to be straight, I find it hard to believe that an LBGT person would walk right on into another closet and build another lie around their identity just to (not really) avoid social repercussions from cheating. I say that as an LBGT person myself. It would be stupid and strange and illogical. Now, if he currently thinks he\u2019s gay and later realised he\u2019s bi, that also wouldn\u2019t be lying. \n\nIt\u2019s just a shitty nonsensical biphobic accusation that doesn\u2019t actually make his actions better or worse. Cheating on your wife is shitty. anyone defending it I\u2019d argue is early in their unlearning homophobia journey, wherein anything gay is given excessive allowance despite social norms because we\u2019re human and it can be hard to navigate boundaries within a new normal. It happens all the time and it\u2019s normal. But eventually your old ideas and new ideas integrate and you regain common sense and realise, no, closeted people *also* have to respect their partners, even if they aren\u2019t attracted to their gender. I\u2019m sure op\u2019s family will realise this eventually and social consequences will come for their brother.

Why are you even still friends with them?", "We don't know for sure though, my friend and his brother are both gay and are only 2 years apart in age. It was very obvious from a young age that his brother was most likely going to come out as gay and his parents were not shocked at all when he officially came out (he came out first). My friend though, they didn't suspect that he was gay at all and they disowned him for a time. He says his father still doesn't fully accept he's gay.", ">AND his family has a history of being supportive. \n\nDo we know that?", "More so that it can be considered an experiment.

I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m condoning either way. Cheating is cheating and the brother should not have been praised just for coming out. But from psychological stand point you can see why he said it. I profile mentally Ill patients all the time. Do I agree with what they are saying? Fuck no. But I understand because of my education and background.

If you profile patients all the time you\u2019d realise this post is *less* than nothing to base this claim on.

I never said flat out he is bi. And as someone who is gay being apart of the LGBTQ is not a mental illness and I never said it was. I just know how peoples minds work when put under stress. You like to pick fights don\u2019t you. You have found a way to pick everyone who has commented on ur comment as a \u201cbiphobic\u201d. U are literally just being fuelled by anger.

People reserve the right to define their own sexuality. If the man says he\u2019s gay, He. Is. Gay. Any speculation about him being bi based on him *cheating* is biphobia. You can just condemn him for the many, *many* shitty, malicious actions he\u2019s undertaken overtly and with his full chest without making up narratives about him being a sneaky, conniving bisexual. That\u2019s immature, excessive, assholish, and, yes, biphobic. It adds nothing to the conversation, does nothing to repair any damage, and doesn\u2019t progress the family\u2019s ability to accept that the brother has done many shitty things and shouldn\u2019t be treated like he\u2019s done anything special.", "I\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m actually having a nice evening. Cooked a big dinner, painting a bit, a lil reddit. I\u2019m in a pretty good mood tbh. I dont have a particular fondness for picking fights, it\u2019s just clear that people are only speculating that the brother is bi because he cheated. He says he is gay. So he\u2019s gay, unless or until he says otherwise. \n\nI did read all you said, multiple times. Your own biases influenced you in determining that the brother may have lied about his sexuality (again) because he is bi and wanted sympathy. Your own biases influenced you in positing that, not \u201cthe brothers perspective\u201d. Cheating was a major factor in your giving credence to the possibility of the brother being secretly bi. As one of the most prevailing biphobic messages is \u201cbi people cheat/are greedy/overly sexually promiscuous/flaky\u201d, any bi=cheating link made is likely done so through subconscious biphobia. \n\n\nWe can just agree to disagree, that\u2019s allowed too.
