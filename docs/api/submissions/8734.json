I came out as gay at the age of 16 because I started a relationship with my current bf, my whole family was so supportive, my parents, my other brother and my sisters but Matt, for some reason he didn\u2019t accept me and distanced himself from me, he would ignore me at family gatherings and speak the bare minimum. \n\nMatt was married to Marina (29F) and they have a five years old adorable boy that  my family adores, a year ago my brother was caught cheating on Marina with a man, he ended up coming out and divorcing Marina, He dumped Marina right after that and my family supported him and welcomed the AP like nothing happened, the affair had been going on for years before Marina found out, Marina was deeply hurt and I felt sorry for her, I\u2019ve known Marina since I was around 8 years. \n\nMy brother and I have kinda reconciled, He apologised for distancing himself. He said he was jealous of me because I could be true to myself and he was stuck in a loveless marriage. My brother married his AP a week ago, I attended the wedding, the day before the wedding Marina had posted about how hurt and blindsided she was and how THIS (the wedding) is so wrong (nothing to see with sexuality, Marina is open-minded), the next day my brother had the nerves to post a video of their vows on social media and tag Marina and many other people and the caption read \u201cIf our love is wrong then I don\u2019t ever wanna be right\u201d. (He got this from a song by Calum Scott, \u201cIf our love is wrong\u201d)\n\nTwo days ago was my dad\u2019s birthday and we all gathered to celebrate it, and Matt started talking to us about how Marina had texted him calling him names for \u201caccidentally\u201d  tagging her, I couldn\u2019t keep it in, that was evil and I know it wasn\u2019t an accident so I told him that Marina was right he is an AH and that song wasn\u2019t to validate affairs and empower cheating partners, that he had some NERVES to try to play the victim here. He didn\u2019t say a word and left  but then my parents started telling me that I ruined the evening and I should know better since I\u2019m gay too and also that I was being homophobic and I should support him because he struggled with his sexuality his whole life. \n\nI get it, it\u2019s different for everyone, not everyone is comfortable coming out but that DOESN\u2019T give you the right to hurt someone else\u2019s feelings and he is trying to play the victim and portraying Marina as an evil, resentful ex who doesn\u2019t want him to be happy. \n\nThey think I should apologise and my whole family seems to be on his side.", "created_utc": 1675137718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pnsib/aita_for_being_homophobic/", "score": 4397, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's an easier card to play then just to say \"I made a mistake by cheating on my wife and dragging it out instead of just coming clean about my feelings\" he'd rather drag marina in the mud then to just own up to what he did. And then your parents sound ridiculous. Sorry, but I'm gonna say that while it's awesome they're supportive they obviously have no idea what homophobia even is. They seem to have that \"woke\" idea of homophobia where anything said negatively about a gay person is automatically homophobia. You did the right thing.

Like, at the very _least_ have a decency to spare poor woman any more trouble...\n\nAlso, I wonder if he takes care of or financially supports his kid in any way or did he *fail* on that front, too?

I would not at all blame him for being more in the closet than his younger brother.\n\nNow he's still an asshole for cheating and being inconsiderate towards his ex.", "You say that as if there isn't a MASSIVE list of ways queer people get discriminated against everyday. The brother could've lost his job, could've been refused services, could've been refused healthcare etc etc. Obviously it isn't right for him to cheat and marry someone he wasn't in love with but it's not like he knowing chose to hurt and cheat on someone. It's not like there wasn't very scary reasons to not come out, to not divorce his wife before getting with a guy but the reality is he was probably scared he'd get seriously discriminated against if he left his wife. OP is seeing there wonderful coming out story and thinking everyone will have that experience and will not be afraid", "It doesn't matter. They were in a monogamous relationship I presume, and he cheated for four years. And your comment about Matt possibly being bi just further stigmatizes bi people as cheaters.

The cheating is obviously awful, but at least own the mistake, say you were stuck and didn\u2019t know how to get out, whatever. But there was *no* reason whatsoever (as far as we know) for him to tag her in that video and gleefully caption it as if he was being vindicated, like he\u2019s some hero for marrying his AP just because they\u2019re both men.", "Exactly this. And using his sexuality as an excuse to justify an affair is disgusting. \n\nOP is NTA. If being \"homophobic\" means you have no tolerance for cheating then I am right there with you.", "It\u2019s amazing how much changed in just the period of time between the brother going to high school and OP going to school. I\u2019m roughly OPs age, my partner and older siblings are roughly the brothers. My sister was shocked when I said we had multiple people out when I was going to high school. Not many girls dating girls, but a couple of guys completely out, trans people wearing their preferred clothing, a solid GSA group with over a dozen members by the time I graduated. My bf told me about listening to guys mock other guys for being pegged, my friends mocked men who weren\u2019t willing to be pegged (which isn\u2019t much better but I digress). It wasn\u2019t great, we got teased from time to time, but it was a very different experience in just a 7-9 year difference.", "Right. He knew he was \"stuck in a loveless marriage\".

He lied, cheated and gaslit her for years. Why do I say gaslit?  All cheaters gaslight their partners when they start to question unusual behaviors or events which happens frequently in cheating.  Little weird things that happen too many times.... you start to question and the cheater will say anything to cover their cheating, even at the expense of their spouse's mental health.\n\nShe had to catch him cheating, then he immediately dumps her, marries his AP and rubs it in her face on social media.  No remorse or shame for what he put her through.\n\nThis isn't about him discovering his sexuality.

Depends on how/when/where you were raised, & your parent's expectations for YOU specifically. \n\nI understand that OP came out & was accepted, but it sounds like the family already knew he was gay. His honesty didn't challenge his family's preconceptions. I'm gay, but I had also consistently showed signs since about 5yrs old.  Now, if my older sibling suddenly came out, after living in a het relationship - even I would have a hard time wrapping my mind around it, because it's not how I currently how I see them.\n\nIf the other brother didn't exhibit any tells & was assumed to be straight, they would NOT be as accepted since it's such a huge shock & the people can't deal with their idolized projections & dreams getting dashed. \n\nI also suspect that the closeted brother was the oldest, since that's the offspring the parents tend to attach their dreams to tightly.", "He said he was gay, not bi, in a very blatant diversion attempt after assaulting children of the same sex. It\u2019s a very different situation, and it wasn\u2019t a lie about his sexuality. \n\n\nOps brother has said he is gay and married a man. Cheating is not a reason to deny people the right to define and label their own sexuality, and tbh I\u2019m pretty disgusted at you trying to straw man with a pedophile?????

That\u2019s hardly what\u2019s happening here. \n\nSpeculating that a self-professed gay man is Bi because he cheated is biphobia.", "Don\u2019t forget there is a long history of misogyny in gay history and liberation. Which is *probably* better today but still present.", "Siblings may not care if they dont like the partner", "We were always very good at communicating about sexuality and feel that most people are on a spectrum. Plenty of heterosexual people, including me, have some fantasies about the same gender. It doesn't always mean you are gay or even Bi. Although it could of course. Everyone is different. There are as many sexualities as there are people! \n\nWe both knew he had some same sex fantasies too but I got a deep sense that it was becoming more dominant for him. We talked and I suggested we separate so he could explore his sexuality. He was actually very resistant and insisted he wasn't gay. I insisted that we separate and see what happened.\n\nOver the following year he did explore some hook ups and we stayed close friends and talked about it. While he had enjoyed the encounters from a sexual perspective he still wasn't sure about having a romantic relationship with a man. \n\nAbout 11 months into our separation he met P and they started a relationship. It was harder than I anticipated to see him falling in love with someone else but it was also wonderful to see him finding himself and being comfortable in who he is. \n\nOur daughter was 3 when we separated and after several months of him being with P I asked to meet him. He was spending more time with my daughter and so I think the Welsh Mam in me just wanted to make sure he was a good human being. Well, P and I hit it off immediately and it was the start of a wonderful friendship with him as well as my ex-husband. I've spent every Christmas with them and my daughter since as well as all our birthdays. \n\nOur daughter went to University a few months ago and I still speak to them both all the time and meet up for dinner regularly. \n\nI hope that explains things more and I'm soooooooo sorry I've rambled at you!", "As others have pointed out, he may not have figured it out until he was married. It happens. I didn't figure out I was gay until about 34, and I've talked with others who figured it out late, as well.

And I'm not defending any cheater here, but coming from the side of the jilted partner, finding out your long term partner is having a years long affair is much much worse than a one night stand.\n\nI'm starting to wonder if people in this sub have every been in relationships before. Of course it's fucking worse! That doesn't make a one night stand ok. That doesn't mean you are required to forgive or accept cheating because it was \"only\" a one night stand. But holy shit people, the level of deception and manipulation required to carry out a years long affair is almost sociopathic.", "Well, not \"children.\" Spacey sexually harassed a man at work. \n\nHe then came out as gay, apparently thinking that the problem was the \"man\" and not the \"harassed.\" It didn't go over well.", "You're an amazing partner and I'm in awe at your insight and response to the whole situation.

Like, how do you sleep with someone of the same gender and not know that you're gay or bi or whatever?", "I get what you're saying here. It's not like you're saying every closeted gay person is allowed a hall pass, you're just saying you get how someone in that situation could make that very hurtful mistake more easily than someone who doesn't have to work out their sexuality.", "This is the thing.  It's naive to think that there will never be a small overlap in some relationships.  A couple of weeks while you sort your head out and figure out what just happened (\"I thought I loved my OH, but new person has turned that on its head, I need time to process\").  There has been no plan to end up in this situation, it's all a bit shit but will be sorted.\n\nContinuing an affair is evidence of willfully betraying the OH.  It says that you don't care about their feelings, you only care about yourself.  This is what OP's brother did.  It's not about his sexuality, it's about the ongoing lies and deceit.  \n\n(For the record, I haven't had an overlap or an affair, but then again I'm married to an amazing person and am lucky enough that we are both secure in our sexuality.)", "Then why keep it secret from the partner? In my opinion any kind of cheating is equally shitty, it's a fundamental breach of trust with the partner. Also puts them in danger of STDs.", "Awwwww thank you so much for your kind words. They mean a lot and you've made my year so far! X", "He came out at 16, his brother was most likely already married by then.\n\nAs OP says, \"He apologised for distancing himself [after I came out]. He said he was jealous of me because I could be true to myself and *he was stuck in a loveless marriage.*\"", "Your second sentence is true, but saying \"betrayal is betrayal\" when we're comparing a one-night affair to a years-long affair is just ridiculous. Obviously one is worse than the other.", "As someone who has been cheated on, it absolutely makes a difference. Yes, betrayal is betrayal but there are varying levels. To cheat on your partner in a one night stand is awful but to carry on a secret life for YEARS is a far far bigger betrayal. It's not just a bad decision or a horrible mistake, it's a concerted effort to lie, manipulate and basically gaslight your partner over a long period of time.\n\nClearly you have never been in such a situation (thankfully), because waking up one day and finding out your entire marriage and life with this person is a complete lie, that the person you married is a total stranger is unimaginable. The love you thought you shared was just a joke you weren't in on and the family you created (birthing children with this man) was predicated on a massive lie. God, I'm getting sick just thinking about it. \n\nHonestly I'll take the betrayal of a one night stand any day over that type trauma again", "That would be a hell of a thing.", "\"Betrayal is betrayal\"  \n\n\nWhat an asinine comment. Yeah, all betrayals are the same. Great mentality to have dude.", "It's like never having eaten something before but you think it looks OK. Then you eat it and its the best tasting thing ever, why haven't you been eating this your whole life etc. \n\nIts not so much that you really think you have zero interest before. It's just that you get with someone you are actually compatible with and the difference between that uncertainty before and complete almost spiritual clarity afterwards is quite dramatic. \n\nThe difference in who I was before my first consensual gay encounter and after was pretty huge. I'm just glad I got to have that withour betraying someone. But can see and at least understand how someone coukd have the urge to try but be to scared, then try one day and it feel like a revelation.", "bot", "They didn't say it was homophobic.", "I 100% agree any cheating is shitty but I do accept that there is a difference in the level of shittness", "> Then why keep it secret from the partner? \n\nBecause the 'I think I'm gay' conversation within a hetero marriage rarely goes over well, and you want to be sure before you drop that bomb if you're still trying to figure out your sexuality at that point.", "Thing is he wasn\u2019t stuck in a loveless marriage.  He put himself there.  He could have divorced and not told her it was because he was gay.  This guy needs serious therapy.  This is evident by the way he treats his ex still to this day.  The guy is a major asshole and treats people awful because of his own issues.", "You need to remember nuance doesn\u2019t exist on this sub.", "Ah, that makes sense. In my opinion it still doesn't make cheating on someone more understandable. People do sexual experimentation and stuff but if they're doing it while they have a partner they should let them know. Also puts their partner at risk of STDs. Well, that is all more to the point of the earlier comment.", "Surely you should want to be sure about the whole \"I'm already in a monogamous relationship\" point before you drop the bomb too. You can be sure of **that** one without sleeping with another person.", "Eh, no avoiding a bad situation at that point really. Either one partner goes behinds their partner's back, experiments, finds out they're gay and their marriage ends, or finds out they're not but still went behind their partner's back and cheated, or they sit on their unprocessed feelings and wonder if they're really gay or not. Of course their partner would be upset either way, but in my opinion it's still better if they tell their partner rather than lie so much to them.", "It doesn't make it more morally justified, right, safe, forgivable etc. Its all still wrong. It's always still scummy don't get me wrong. \n\nI do feel it's more understandable though, like I get why it happens. It happens as people aren't sure they are this way, I wasn't sure I could even like guys more than just fantasy until I had a dick in my mouth. And its a huge risk to gamble that you actually are that way and ruin your entire life, change how other perceive you forever and give up on a lot of conventional safeties. When again, maybe you aren't even gay? I understand the doubts and reasons for testing the waters. I don't think they are justified but it's not like just sleeping with someone else, it's your whole life being different if you are that way. \n\nMuch more risk and personal impact to exploration than just a straight guy sleeping with another woman. I think that risk and personal impact from exploring makes more panicked actions than normal, and though still unforgivable it is understandable to me at least. \n\nExperienced the world ending and being something new twice as transitioned later in life. Its pretty terrifying knowing you can make a change in life that will alter everyone's perceptions of you and likely come with much less safety, cost you family and friends (lost half when gay, lost nearly everything and had to build from scratch when trans). \n\nThe kind of fear that puts in you makes people stupid sometimes. Doesn't mean you should forgive them but I can understand how people make mistakes out of fear and doubt."]}
