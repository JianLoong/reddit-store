I came out as gay at the age of 16 because I started a relationship with my current bf, my whole family was so supportive, my parents, my other brother and my sisters but Matt, for some reason he didn\u2019t accept me and distanced himself from me, he would ignore me at family gatherings and speak the bare minimum. \n\nMatt was married to Marina (29F) and they have a five years old adorable boy that  my family adores, a year ago my brother was caught cheating on Marina with a man, he ended up coming out and divorcing Marina, He dumped Marina right after that and my family supported him and welcomed the AP like nothing happened, the affair had been going on for years before Marina found out, Marina was deeply hurt and I felt sorry for her, I\u2019ve known Marina since I was around 8 years. \n\nMy brother and I have kinda reconciled, He apologised for distancing himself. He said he was jealous of me because I could be true to myself and he was stuck in a loveless marriage. My brother married his AP a week ago, I attended the wedding, the day before the wedding Marina had posted about how hurt and blindsided she was and how THIS (the wedding) is so wrong (nothing to see with sexuality, Marina is open-minded), the next day my brother had the nerves to post a video of their vows on social media and tag Marina and many other people and the caption read \u201cIf our love is wrong then I don\u2019t ever wanna be right\u201d. (He got this from a song by Calum Scott, \u201cIf our love is wrong\u201d)\n\nTwo days ago was my dad\u2019s birthday and we all gathered to celebrate it, and Matt started talking to us about how Marina had texted him calling him names for \u201caccidentally\u201d  tagging her, I couldn\u2019t keep it in, that was evil and I know it wasn\u2019t an accident so I told him that Marina was right he is an AH and that song wasn\u2019t to validate affairs and empower cheating partners, that he had some NERVES to try to play the victim here. He didn\u2019t say a word and left  but then my parents started telling me that I ruined the evening and I should know better since I\u2019m gay too and also that I was being homophobic and I should support him because he struggled with his sexuality his whole life. \n\nI get it, it\u2019s different for everyone, not everyone is comfortable coming out but that DOESN\u2019T give you the right to hurt someone else\u2019s feelings and he is trying to play the victim and portraying Marina as an evil, resentful ex who doesn\u2019t want him to be happy. \n\nThey think I should apologise and my whole family seems to be on his side.", "created_utc": 1675137718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pnsib/aita_for_being_homophobic/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cheating is cheating, and not only do you not have to be accepting of that without judgement, but the fact that he re-victimized Marina that way is depraved.", "NTA.\n\nMatt was deliberately evil toward Marina when he tagged her in that post. You were 100% right to call him out. That would be bad enough if she was simply his ex, but she's also his child's mother. He has an obligation to his son to try to maintain a civil relationship with Marina.\n\nIt's fine for him to be happy about his new marriage. It's not fine for him to be evil toward his ex. He's the AH, not you.", "NTA, your brother may have been conflicted about his sexuality but he strung along an innocent woman for years in a loveless marriage, only to boast how he is now \"happy\". Your brother is a cheater, plain and simple.", "NTA. It seems like you and Marina are the only ones who aren't. They're all assholes.", "NTA. Like at all. Your family is the AH for saying you were being homophobic when you were calling out unethical behavior. That was beyond heartbreaking for Marina to get tagged in that post after she was cheated on.", "NTA. Your family is trying to pull in a whole host of strawman arguments to mislabel you in this situation. You were simply calling out his petty, passive-aggressive tagging. Huge difference.", "Matt is a huge asshole for tagging his ex-wife on his new wedding vows. \"Ha Ha, I'm happy I left you\" is an asshole thing to send to an ex-spouse.\n\nMatt being an asshole when cheating and Matt being an asshole even as he was getting married again have nothing to do with his sexuality.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and the correct spelling is \"ho-phobic\"", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s a cheater and he was not an ally for you when you came out.  He chose to cheat on her.  If it was a loveless marriage, he could have left her.  He could even have stayed officially single if he wanted to stay in the closet.  He chose otherwise. And to tag her for his wedding? That\u2019s just malicious.", "Nta. The family is just enabling his cheating. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with gay or straight it has to do with character", "NTA\n\nThe only part I feel you\u2019re the AH on is doing it at the dads birthday celebration. But what would a family event be without \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f drama \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f \n\nOtherwise, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not homophobic to stand up for his ex wife. I don\u2019t think not supporting someone \u201cfinding themself\u201d and coming out via cheating is homophobic either. Coming out and being yourself can be very hard. Based off how he treated you growing up, obviously he really struggled with his identity. It sounds like you\u2019re happy for him, but being happy someone else is happy/finally themselves doesn\u2019t mean you have to support/excuse their shitty behavior.  They were married and have a son together making her technically family in my eyes. I feel like given the bigger picture you should come together to apologize for the outburst and explain where you\u2019re coming from. I assume regardless of his actions, that\u2019s your brother whom you love.", "NTA - there\u2019s a right way to do things here. You can still support your brother but also believe that what he did was an awful thing to do to his ex. That doesn\u2019t make you anti-gay, it makes you anti AH", "NTA, but your family's opinion is not going to change. I think your brother is trying to make up for lost time and somehow resents his wife for being closeted for so long. The best advice I could give you is to recommend therapy for everyone involved (your brother, his ex-wife, and his child). What your brother did was cruel, but you cannot call him out on this since he barely had a relationship with you and he will distort anything you say to him.", "NTA\n\nAsk your family this: If Matt had been seeing another woman during his marriage and decided to leave his family and marry her, would they feel the same? Even if he said he'd been struggling with his feelings or a sexual addiction or whatever for most of his life?\n\nBecause if they would act differently if everyone in the situation was CIS-gender, then they are being hypocrites now by using Matt's struggles with his sexuality as an excuse for being a cheating jerk and now making Marina out to be the bad ex-spouse instead of taking responsibility for his bad behavior.\n\nIt has nothing to do with gay or straight. It has to do with respect. Matt has shown no respect to Marina, the mother of his only child, in how he's handled things. And he's using his struggle with his sexuality as an excuse. Not cool.\n\nMatt and his husband should go on and be happy. But he owes Marina an apology for how he handled all of this. Especially how he \"accidentally\" (on purpose?) tagged her in the wedding photo. He also owes the family an apology for talking bad about Marina. He needs to own the way he handled all of this and try to mend fences and move on. If, for nothing else, the sake of his child. Hopefully everyone will be able to move forward, own their mistakes, get past their grief, and find happiness.", "NTA Still waiting for the part where you were homophobic thought?", "NTA.   Kinda rude to be a dick to your former unwilling beard.", "NTA. What your brother did was wrong. The moment he realized he is gay, he should have divorced Marina. Not stay married to her and cheat behind her back.", "NTA\nYour brother is being petty and mean to his child's mother. His cheating and blindsiding crumbled her entire world and then he had to run her nose in it all too? That's just cruel. He is going to need to get his act together for his child and learn how to grow up and co parent without insulting her more. This is basic respect and dignity, nothing to do with sexual orientation.", "NTA. How do you \"favorite child\" without saying favorite child? \n\nMatt knew he was in a loveless marriage, yet never left before it turned that way. He cheated for years on his wife unapologetically. Within a year, he was engaged and married. He retaliated against his hurt ex-wife (and mother of his child) by tagging her with his wedding vows. Those are the facts.\n\nThere's being supportive of your child coming out as gay, and then there's enabling someone. Your family should put themselves in Marina's shoes and see if they would like being treated that way, and I bet you they wouldn't. It was cruel from start to finish. The fact you called out the cruelty means you know better.\n\nI wouldn't apologize because then I'd be enabling what he did.", "NTA\n\nYour parents need to learn that assholes come in all colors, race, creed and sexuality. Hey, they have two gay sons... and one of them's an asshole! What a wonderful world! \n\nYou don't excuse shitty behavior because someone's in a marginalized group. if you do, you're not an ally, you're actually treating them as less-than. And it's virtue signaling in the most cringey way possible. Everyone should be held to the same standard of kindness. \n\nYour brother is being a flaming asshole to his ex, who has had her whole life turned upside-down. He needs to quit rubbing her nose in it and develop some empathy.", "NTA here and your parents are going to be a big challenge going forward...  sorry.", "NTA\n\nI came across this a few times: LGTQ members are being called homophobic, POC being called racist, Jews being called antisemitic, left leaner being called Maga hats etc. - only because they \"dare\" criticizing or pointing out something humanly wrong.\n\nYou did the right thing here, calling your brother out on his behavior.", "NTA", "NTA. Calling him out for being cruel to his ex by tagging her in the post or being unfaithful isn\u2019t being homophobic. It\u2019s not homophobia to hold someone accountable- who happens to be lgbtq.", "NTA - no you are not being homophobic.  Your brother hurt someone by having an affair.  \n\nJust because your gay, doesn't grant you the right to turn into a lying snake destroying memories and wasting someone's life and shattering dreams.  \n\nThis doesn't even beat Straight dudes saying another man looks good. Yes, that is homophobic.  Every man should have an ideal look or goal to achieve in there mind.  What they believe is attractive to base there looks on.  \n\nIt's not being gay, but the insecurity to talk about that is being homophobic.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA - you know this homophobic is BS.  Your family will never see anything he did as wrong and that you can admit your brother is an asshole for what he did to Marina is amazing.  Your brother needs a reality check for the abuse he caused to Marina by lying to her that whole relationship.  He needs counseling and to apologize for the time he stole from her life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
