Their attempts at badgering you into doing the same was foolish.   \n\n\nOkay, so what to do now. You need to make some choices.

As the oldest child who was supposed to be a role model, but not a parent to my brothers who I was constantly left in charge of, I feel this. I'm honestly happy the middle child is getting the attention he needs now. Our mom can really focus on one of us at once, and he needs it the most.
