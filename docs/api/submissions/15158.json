I responded by explaining that I was uncomfortable as well with her bringing home the men and both my partner and I were consistently walking in on her.

Her behaviour is not normal or acceptable. The whole \"only you can fix me\" is deeply manipulative too. You did the right thing, it's your house and your rules.", "NTA. She needs to have some self respect, the heck with multiple guys like as if your apartment is a brothel. Absolutely disgusting. She is the AH", "Oh my god NTA at all. 10 days out of the month was already an excessive amount of time to be staying with her adult offspring and her partner but to be bringing over men and having sex with them in a communal area? And then to blame you for her life situation? Big AH move.\n\nYou probably have more patience than I do but I honestly wouldn\u2019t even bother spending Christmas with this person.", "You are not responsible for your mother's mental health and happiness. She's unwilling to do the work it takes to change her life, including therapy and removing herself from her current living situation.\n\nYou are not responsible for your mother's mental health and happiness. It is very selfish of her to disrespect you, your partner, and your home. She's been putting you both in awkward and unsafe situations bringing men she doesn't know into your home. You were too nice offering to let her continue visiting just not as often despite this. \n\nNTA - You are not responsible for your mother's mental health and happiness!\n\nIf anything she's the a\\*\\*hole for putting this all on you!", "NTA She is actively making you and your partner uncomfortable. At the barest minimum, y'all deserve to be able to walk into your home and not see someone having sex. The fact that she, as a mother, is comfortable having her daughter see her have sex is exceedingly inappropriate. The term \"emotional incest\" gets thrown around here often but this is an extreme example. OP, it sounds like she has a history of manipulating you and making you responsible for her feelings and well-being. Please, please consider talking to someone about this. You deserve support while dealing with an incredibly difficult family member.", "Excuse me? She should be embarrassed to even do all that in your house let alone in the open. Don't pay her back for the couch just give it back to her. Do you even want it? \n\nYour mom is driving a wedge between you and your partner so kick her out as quick as possible. I low key feel as if she's doing it on purpose. When you told her to move out she blamed your partner to demonize them which makes me feel like she doesn't like them much. Of course I'm not there, but why assume you'd be more okay with it than the partner?\n\nYour mom blaming you for destroying her life is so overly dramatic. Nobody needs to give blow jobs on your couch let alone your mom. It's immature of her to blame her inability to eat or get out of bed. Don't let her guilt trip you. NTA", "NTA your mom sounds like a narcissist or has borderline personality disorder. She has problems and the only way that gets fixed is if she truly wants to work on herself and is in Intense therapy. But narcissists rarely get therapy. You\u2019re probably going to have to go low to no contact with her if you want to have a healthy life of your own.", "NTA, not at all. This behaviour is really abnormal and intrusive, and disrespectful of your home. 1) insisting on spending 1/3 of her time in her daughter's home so she can find men to have sex with is reeeeeally unhealthy and 2) insisting you're the only ones who can help her is manipulative and sick.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP. Setting boundaries so that you feel good in your relationships is necessary and healthy.", "Yeah, she's a narcissist and you're NTA.", "Oh HELL no. NTA hands down. \n\nFirst of all why does she feel the need to bring men home to YOUR apartment and get her freak on?? Secondly she is straight up manipulating you emotionally to satisfy her own selfish needs. I understand the need to want to help our parents out when we are older but there MUST be boundaries set all around. It's also impossible to try and help someone who won't even help themselves. Unless you are okay with continuing to live with a manipulative person I suggest to not only kick her out ASAP, but have very low contact with her.", "WTH? Why is she bringing home strange and banging them in the living room? JFC! Definitely NTA. Damn mum is randy!", "What kind of mother does that to her child? How can she bring men in your home and do this and that, in the sofa or in the room? Lol your mom is a huge B here. Not to mention the guilt tripping afterwards...", "NTA. Your mom is being very emotionally abusive. Her behavior when she was staying with you was very manipulative and inappropriate. She\u2019s a very unhealthy influence in your life.", "Obviously NTA, your mom was overstepping and now she's trying to manipulate you.", "NTA\n\nUncomfortableness aside, your mom bringing random men to your apartment also puts all three of you in danger.", "NTA. You\u2019re joking right? Your mums life is ruined if she doesn\u2019t get to give blowjobs in your flat? \n\nI know Reddit is wild sometimes but I\u2019d block her for this. See her at Christmas and ask why she hates giving bjs at her own place.", "I would have kicked her out the first time she got it on in a shared space. NTA for kicking her out and don\u2019t let her guilt you. Why couldn\u2019t she bring these men back to her own place anyway?", "You are not responsible for your mum. And I'm not sure what kind of upbringing you had, but the way you refer to your own mother bringing home random guys and openly having sex with them in your home, in your LIVING ROOM makes me think that you should concentrate on getting therapy for yourself and take your mum up on her offer to wait until Christmas to see her again - if then. \n\n\nNTA but your post is disturbing on many levels - especially your acceptance of your mums behaviour. You should reevaluate your relationship with her and learn about boundaries. None of this is normal, or remotely okay! And it's definitely not your fault.", "INFO \n\nCan you elaborate more on the \"living with an emotionally abusive alcoholic part\" \nWhere does she stay when not with you guys? What is the living situation like? \nAnd why does progressing in career require her to stay with you guys?", "[deleted]", "NTA but you both should have had the chat with her and been firm might of been a different out come who knows", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So I will just say this. Your mom definitely needs some therapy or something. As for the sofa bed I wouldn't pay her anything. I'd tell her to come get it, I wouldn't feel comfortable keeping it.", "NTA! i dont know better term for this than emotional abuse and emotional manipulation, and a bad one at that, stop having contact with your mom!!!!!! No help, no talk, no nothing, i should know, thats better for you trust me", "NTA. Let her know she is welcome to have her hookup couch removed from your place or it will be burned. Jeezus.", "Bro ur Mom has something wrong with her brain...\nWho does that in their Child's house like... She stays 5 days with you and in those days she's doing this...\n\nThis is incredibly Sickening...\n\nWith age comes wisdom...

It's disrespectful for you and specially for your partner as well. She doesn't even want to admit what she did was wrong nor does she want to change. She should learn how to be respectful towards you and your partner and have some self respect. NTA", "Jeebus\n\nCut that toxicity out of your life.\n\nShe obviously has no shame does she? You are not responsible for her. She is an adult. You and your other half have a right to be comfortable in your own home.\n\nStand your ground. She is throwing  a strop to get her own way. \n\nStonewall her and if she is looking for money for the couch, if you can afford to buy your own. Ask her to pick it \n\nNTA", "NTA.

OP NTA!", "NTA. She\u2019s clearly disrespected your home, your boundaries, and your partner. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with not allowing her to spend time there anymore.

Don't even let her visit.", "You are NTA, sweetie. Your mum is, and she is an entitled and manipulative one at that. There is no excuse that she could use to justify using your home, aka YOUR SAFE SPACE, as her own personal sex motel.\n\nETA, she doesn't even care about your safety. These men could use their little fun time as a way to case your house, then come back later and assault, rob, rape and/or kill you. She is being reckless and putting your life on the line to do it."]}
