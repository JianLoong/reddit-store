Literally just a regular brushing, mouthwash rinse, and flossing. Upon returning to bed she questioned why I went outside and why I was in the bathroom for so long which was maybe about 5 minutes. I told her I was just brushing my teeth and she immediately became cold to me in a way I had never seen her before.\n\nShe told me that it's rude and inconsiderate to do what I did because it essentially \"shoves her inadequacies into her face\". Apparently when growing up she had multiple cavities and other dental issues, but I never even noticed any problems with her teeth. Like I said, this has been a nightly routine for me for years since I was a kid.\n\nWe went to sleep after our argument and we've been pretty okay since, but a couple of my friends and my older brother have said I was the ass in this situation for even having a dental kit and that missing a night would have been worth not making her uncomfortable.\n\nSo was I really the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1675348589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rraro/aita_for_having_a_strict_dental_hygiene_routine/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That has got to be a first.  Who the hell is upset because their lover brushes their teeth right before bed. She is being ridiculous.", "Lol. What? \n\nAs a woman and a raging feminist, I do not say this lightly, but: she might be crazy.\n\nThis is just bizarre. How are you supposed to know that she had a bunch of cavities? How are you supposed to know that it\u2019s because of poor hygiene and not poor genetics? Why would having poor hygiene yourself solve this problem?

Questions.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, and I see two possibilities here:\n\n1) She's unreasonable & overreacts to every small thing that bothers her, and this is a major red flag.\n\n2) She really does have some serious hang-ups about teeth/dental care, based on bad experiences in the past, which is why she took something innocuous so personally. You said her teeth look fine, but maybe there are (or were) some serious issues that aren't apparent? If this is the case, it is very much HER problem, NOT yours -- and it was completely unfair of her to burden you with a reaction like that. Going forward, you can ask her to communicate with you better about it in the future, and see if there's anything you can do to help/support her as she copes with it.

Literally I'm sitting here boggled at the idea that anyone would think you were an ass for taking care of your teeth.

It sounds like she is severely self conscious over her teeth and dental history and she takes any mention of dental health as an affront to her. You couldn\u2019t know that nor are you responsible for it. Also, it\u2019s a good thing to brush your teeth so the idea of not doing so for a night is kind of gross.

Who would take someone brushing his teeth as an attack? Even if she's insecure about her teeth, it's a ridiculous reaction and your friends and brother make no sense either. I see it's a very new relationship, so there hasn't been a lot of time to see how she behaves, but I'd pay attention to see if this a pattern.\n\nAlso, there's nothing weird about keeping a dental kit.

I wonder what the timeline was here too. If they just finished having sex or making out or are about to start, then he goes to get his \"dental kit\" - that may have come across more like \"you're gross\". \n\nCleaning up after sex is normal, but if you make it a big deal, it can come across poorly.", "I do that.
