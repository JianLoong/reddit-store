This last weekend we spent the entire Saturday together on one long date. I thought it was the perfect day. Not a single iota of negative vibes or unpleasant for the entire day.\n\nWe ended the night at her apartment. Before we went to sleep I went to my car to get my dental kit and went to the bathroom to do my nightly routine. I don't think it's anything out of the ordinary. Literally just a regular brushing, mouthwash rinse, and flossing. Upon returning to bed she questioned why I went outside and why I was in the bathroom for so long which was maybe about 5 minutes. I told her I was just brushing my teeth and she immediately became cold to me in a way I had never seen her before.\n\nShe told me that it's rude and inconsiderate to do what I did because it essentially \"shoves her inadequacies into her face\". Apparently when growing up she had multiple cavities and other dental issues, but I never even noticed any problems with her teeth. Like I said, this has been a nightly routine for me for years since I was a kid.\n\nWe went to sleep after our argument and we've been pretty okay since, but a couple of my friends and my older brother have said I was the ass in this situation for even having a dental kit and that missing a night would have been worth not making her uncomfortable.\n\nSo was I really the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1675348589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rraro/aita_for_having_a_strict_dental_hygiene_routine/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Imagine what it'll be like when you get a new job and are 'shoving her career problems in her face' or when you lose weight and are 'shoving her ugliness in her face' or are... eh, you get the idea.", "NTA, also I would be worried with where the line gets drawn if after 1 month she\u2019s trying to victimize herself because you\u2026 brushed and flossed.", "NTA. That has got to be a first.  Who the hell is upset because their lover brushes their teeth right before bed. She is being ridiculous.", "Lol. What? \n\nAs a woman and a raging feminist, I do not say this lightly, but: she might be crazy.\n\nThis is just bizarre. How are you supposed to know that she had a bunch of cavities? How are you supposed to know that it\u2019s because of poor hygiene and not poor genetics? Why would having poor hygiene yourself solve this problem? If the cavities happened when she was a child, why hasn\u2019t she upped her teeth game as an adult? I. Have. Questions.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, and I see two possibilities here:\n\n1) She's unreasonable & overreacts to every small thing that bothers her, and this is a major red flag.\n\n2) She really does have some serious hang-ups about teeth/dental care, based on bad experiences in the past, which is why she took something innocuous so personally. You said her teeth look fine, but maybe there are (or were) some serious issues that aren't apparent? If this is the case, it is very much HER problem, NOT yours -- and it was completely unfair of her to burden you with a reaction like that. Going forward, you can ask her to communicate with you better about it in the future, and see if there's anything you can do to help/support her as she copes with it. But even then, hiding your normal dental hygeine from her is NOT a longterm solution.\n\nYou gotta brush, you gotta floss!", "NTA. I don't see anything wrong with this. This is a big red flag for your girlfriend though. It's weird that she's so upset over your dental routine. And how were you supposed to know her dental history? Be cautious about future insecurities.", "NTA - her insecurities are just that, her insecurities. \n\nCommending your good dental habits, as they'll definitely help you out in the long run.", "NTA. Literally I'm sitting here boggled at the idea that anyone would think you were an ass for taking care of your teeth. This woman really, really needs to learn that the fact that she feels bad about herself because of something you did doesn't automatically mean you did something wrong or have anything to feel bad about or apologize for. Honestly, there is literally no reason to expect that brushing your teeth before bed is going to make someone uncomfortable. This is a red flag from her.", "NTA you may want to end it now if she\u2019s already giving issues over basic hygiene\u2026.", "NTA \n\nVery strange response from her; the only possible weird thing in this whole post is you calling it a \u201cdental kit\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. In what world does one have to sacrifice their oral health to compensate for another? Plaque can impact heart health. OMG- keep the routine and lose this person. This is not a normal reaction- and, remember, oral bacteria is transferrable so her yuck mouth impacts yours!", "NTA - But her crazy is showing.  BIG red flag!", "NTA. She\u2019s insecure. You may want to keep an eye on that red flag", "I can't believe anyone would have an issue with this. NTA.", "This is the weirdest thing to have an argument over. I find it a bit amusing you cannot a dental kit, it sounds like you came equipt with numerous tools for your teeth, and maybe that\u2019s what sparked something in her mind, but you can call it whatever you want. It sounds like she is severely self conscious over her teeth and dental history and she takes any mention of dental health as an affront to her. You couldn\u2019t know that nor are you responsible for it. Also, it\u2019s a good thing to brush your teeth so the idea of not doing so for a night is kind of gross. I would want a partner hanging around in the morning without access to a toothbrush", "NTA, \n\nGood for you for taking good care of your teeth. You only have the one set, and dental problems can be painful and costly. \n\nShe sounds insecure, and it's quite an odd thing to take issue with. Does she do her makeup? If so, would it be right for you to take an issue because it's rude and inconsiderate as men don't generally wear makeup, and  it shoves your inadequacies in your face? Or if she practiced a skin care routine, and you had a problem? \n\nIt's just weird. Self-care is sexy, and all of us could probably improve in one way or another. Don't let other people stop you from practicing healthy habits and self care. This is an issue with her, not you.", "NTA You did nothing wrong, but she seems to have some serious problems.", "NTA honestly her reaction is a red flag. It's irrational.  As a woman honestly I'd tell you to steer clear.", "NTA \n\nBut also, what??? \nThose are the three things you ought to be doing every night. \nSpeaking as someone who has molars with deep grooves, Ive been prone to cavities all my life (including childhood) and have several fillings despite best efforts.\n\nThat said I do everything youre doing to actively combat more cavities so I dont understand how someone in a similar boat as me takes offense to that.", "NTA. Also: \ud83d\udea9", "NTA she thinks it\u2019s rude for you to brush your teeth at night? Does she not brush her teeth? What is going to happen when she learns that people brush their teeth twice a day? How are there other adults in your life who think it is an A H move to brush your teeth before bed? This one is really confusing to me. But if I had to choose between brushing my teeth and a month long relationship I\u2019d choose my teeth every time.", "NTA\n\nI find this extremely bizarre... Who would take someone brushing his teeth as an attack? Even if she's insecure about her teeth, it's a ridiculous reaction and your friends and brother make no sense either. I see it's a very new relationship, so there hasn't been a lot of time to see how she behaves, but I'd pay attention to see if this a pattern.\n\nAlso, there's nothing weird about keeping a dental kit. If I'm not sleeping at my place, you can bet I'm taking one. I feel gross if I go to bed without brushing my teeth, and that has only happened when I literally had no choice.", "NTA. \u2018Shoving her inadequacies in her face\u2019?!?  Even had you know growing up she wasn\u2019t taught proper dental hygiene, which you didn\u2019t, how is taking care of your own shoving anything in her face?  \n\nIt\u2019s only been a month\u2026this is seriously over the top nonsense\u2026might want to spit this one out\u2026..", "NTA bro, keep up the good hygiene. It's a good habit to keep. She's insecure and got mad over you brushing your teeth. Did she even brush?", "Wait...I'm so confused. Can you never brush your teeth or discuss oral hygiene around her?

I would maybe brush once a day but in general I was very bad to my teeth, they were probably weeks away from striking before i actually smartened up. But that doesn't mean I get insecure when my partner flosses and brushes and uses their retainer. Honestly it's really helpful because now I can brush my teeth at the same time as them to keep myself more on track", "NTA. Her lack of hygiene doesn't make your normal (not even strict) hygiene a bad thing. The AH are those telling you that you're the AH here.\n\nHow can she get mad of you for having hygiene??? Hygiene is attractive and the bare minimum??? Who wants to sleep to the smelly breath of their partner??? She wanna torture her lungs, is it???\n\nIt's her fault for not brushing and then getting cavities and what not. She shouldn't be blaming you for her own inadequacy. She should be fixing it and improving her hygiene.\n\nYou stand your ground, King. Your routine isn't strict; it's the bare minimum you could do for yourself. You're doing the right thing by keeping yourself clean and your teeth healthy.\n\nPlus, if you miss on one night, she'll demand for more. She just seems to not want to be the only one with dental issues here. Sharing problems isn't caring.\n\nIf her growing up issue bother her so much (judging by how extreme her reaction was), she needs therapy, not a boyfriend with newly developed cavities.\n\nAlso, what does she expect you to do with her insecurity? Get matching cavities??\n\nTell her to brush her teeth. @/GF, don't be so unhygienic and don't be a bad hygiene influence to others by guilt-tripping them, whatsoever.\n\nIf it continues and if she doesn't take care of her dental health, drop her. Kissing her insecure and guilt-tripping ass isn't worth losing all your teeth in the future. Put yourself first, King.", "???????\n\nWhaaaaaaa? \n\nSo weird \n\nNTA", "NTA. That girl sounds unhinged. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone taking someone else\u2019s dental hygiene personally, that is ridiculous. The fact that it\u2019s even an issue is concerning, what other trivial nonsense will she take as a personal affront?", "NTA\n\nThe bish is pyscho RUN RUN RUN!!!! Brushing your own teeth is somehow an insult to her. Raging NARCISSIST RUN RUN RUN, she will ruin your life seriously RUN!", "NTA and run. I have trash teeth of my own doing. I have never taken an issue with a partner having better hygiene than me. And the bar for \u2018better hygiene than me\u2019 is low. \n\nThe behavior and thought process won\u2019t be limited to hygiene. \n\nWhat if you get a career that makes more than her? Or pursue a hobby she is bad at? It\u2019ll be this shit on repeat.", "NTA. Some women are insecure over the strangest and most petty things. HUGE red flag. Maybe just let her know how important it is to you to do your nightly routine wherever you lay your head, and you can't be guilted into stopping just because it brings up someone else's insecurities. I'd also question your compatibility as a couple. As you said, it's only been about a month so there's still a way out with a *no harm, no foul* attitude.", "NTA.  I personally think it's a bit weird that you keep that you had a full 'dental kit' in your car ready to go (a toothbrush for that kind of thing would really be fine, mouth wash and flossing are personal preferences and doing them regularly is a thing I've only heard of from Americans).  However, being a little anal about your dental hygiene isn't anything to apologies for, nor something for someone else to get upset over!", "NTA... as a dental assistant I applaud your dedication to your dental routine. It may save you thousands of dollars of dental work in the future and you wont wake up with dragon breath.  GF needs to get over her insecurities and follow your lead.", "Nta.  She is taking out her insecurities on you. That is something she needs to address. Why would she want you to have bad dental hygiene when she states how inadequate hers made her feel? That makes no sense", "NTA\nbut what a bizarre reaction to someone practicing basic hygiene?? also how would you have known that she had cavities as a child? and if she had cavities as a kid she should be practicing good dental hygiene now that she's an adult", "I don't understand.  She's mad bc you brushed your teeth?  It shoves her inadequacies in her face.  Does she not brush her teeth?  WTF?", "NTA dental care is serious business, and expensive. You only get the two sets of teeth, and you're already on the second one. Plus I bet she'd hate it if you skipped your routine and your breath stank", "Is she aware you also regularly wipe your ass too?\n\nYou may need to have a conversation. \n\nNTA", "Wow. NTA\n\nAll you did was practice proper dental hygiene, and she took it as a personal attack.  So, what\u2019s next. You can\u2019t exercise more than her? You can\u2019t have a better diet than her? You\u2019re not an asshole.", "She's the asshole. Your friends are just stupid.\n\nDude, that is definitely a red flag.", "NTA. \n\nThat's a her problem, not a you problem. Genetics also play a huge part in teeth issues.\n\nAre you sure you want a relationship with this person?", "NTA\n\nBut break up with her now. If she acts like this over you brushing your teeth, it's only going to get worse,", "NTA but .. why didn't you just take that stuff up with you out of the car beforehand man? Just seems like a hassle to go down to the car just to get it.\nUnless you didn't think you were gonna stay the night at which point .. why you got that stuff in your car dude?", "YTA for telling your friends and brother about personal hygiene disagreement between you and your GF! Your girlfriend's dental routine is nobody's business.", "LMFFAAAOOO, I STAN YOUR ENERGY. I'm screenshotting this.\n\nAlso, as a fellow feminist who doesn't like any gender to be put down just for their gender, I agree with you. Not because she's a female but because of her behaviour.", "Fellow woman and feminist here! She's absolutely batshit crazy. I came here expecting some 20 step dental process and all I found was standard hygiene. Sucks that she has crappy teeth, but she's like someone with acne complaining that someone else washes their face and moisturizes.", "Old lady feminist here, and I agree on the crazy.  This is not a normal response", "Also a feminist who doesn't see what this has to do with feminism or gender at all.\n\nBut yes, crazy.", "Many people have their toothbrush with them regardless. He might've forgotten to take it or maybe it slipped out.", "Just trying not to perpetuate the \u201cshe sounds crazy\u201d trope. \n\nWomen frequently get called \u201ccrazy\u201d for completely reasonable reactions. Thus: I am hesitant to call a woman \u201ccrazy\u201d. But in this case: she sounds crazy."]}
