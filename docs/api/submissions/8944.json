Literally just a regular brushing, mouthwash rinse, and flossing. Upon returning to bed she questioned why I went outside and why I was in the bathroom for so long which was maybe about 5 minutes. I told her I was just brushing my teeth and she immediately became cold to me in a way I had never seen her before.\n\nShe told me that it's rude and inconsiderate to do what I did because it essentially \"shoves her inadequacies into her face\". Apparently when growing up she had multiple cavities and other dental issues, but I never even noticed any problems with her teeth. Like I said, this has been a nightly routine for me for years since I was a kid.\n\nWe went to sleep after our argument and we've been pretty okay since, but a couple of my friends and my older brother have said I was the ass in this situation for even having a dental kit and that missing a night would have been worth not making her uncomfortable.\n\nSo was I really the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1675348589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rraro/aita_for_having_a_strict_dental_hygiene_routine/", "score": 415, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What? \n\nAs a woman and a raging feminist, I do not say this lightly, but: she might be crazy.\n\nThis is just bizarre. How are you supposed to know that she had a bunch of cavities? How are you supposed to know that it\u2019s because of poor hygiene and not poor genetics? Why would having poor hygiene yourself solve this problem?

Questions.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, and I see two possibilities here:\n\n1) She's unreasonable & overreacts to every small thing that bothers her, and this is a major red flag.\n\n2) She really does have some serious hang-ups about teeth/dental care, based on bad experiences in the past, which is why she took something innocuous so personally. You said her teeth look fine, but maybe there are (or were) some serious issues that aren't apparent? If this is the case, it is very much HER problem, NOT yours -- and it was completely unfair of her to burden you with a reaction like that. Going forward, you can ask her to communicate with you better about it in the future, and see if there's anything you can do to help/support her as she copes with it.

It sounds like she is severely self conscious over her teeth and dental history and she takes any mention of dental health as an affront to her. You couldn\u2019t know that nor are you responsible for it. Also, it\u2019s a good thing to brush your teeth so the idea of not doing so for a night is kind of gross.

Who would take someone brushing his teeth as an attack? Even if she's insecure about her teeth, it's a ridiculous reaction and your friends and brother make no sense either.

My hubs had a toothbrush and deodorant packed for our second date and I found it considerate he thought about having the means to take care of possible morning breath/general stank if we did end up spending a night together!", "Lots of us have that sort of stuff in our car, office desk drawer, etc.  We never know when we might be out eating and get something stuck in our teeth which would drive us nuts for hours.", "I keep a dental kit in my glovebox, it's not presumptuous", "That's a good point. I wonder what the timeline was here too. If they just finished having sex or making out or are about to start, then he goes to get his \"dental kit\" - that may have come across more like \"you're gross\". \n\nCleaning up after sex is normal, but if you make it a big deal, it can come across poorly.", "I do that. It barely takes space and I know it's there in case I need it and I won't have to go to bed feeling gross.", "Yes if he has a strict routine, I bet he does it after lunch too", "This is a level of over thinking mundane things that kind of baffles me. \n\nIt sounds exhausting. Who sees someone go brush their teeth and thinks anything other than \u201cmakes sense, dental hygiene is important\u201d.", "As a female, feminist, diagnosed with cluster B personality disorders\u2026 \u201cShe sounds crazy.\u201d", "NTA. Very strange to take something like that personally.", "NTA. I have problems with dental hygiene growing up until recently. If my partner does that, I\u2019ll be happy that I have someone that hopefully can keep me accountable/motivate me to take care of my teeth. She\u2019s insecure and projecting. Take care of your pearly whites!", "NTA. If she\u2019s tripping about you having basic oral hygiene imagine how she\u2019ll react to literally anything else.", "NTA, also, don\u00b4t kiss a girl who doesn\u00b4t brush her teeth, that\u00b4s gross", "She's projecting her insecurities on to you. NTA and keep an eye open for future red flags.", "NTA. Uhh...what? Your girlfriend has a history of dental problems and doesn't brush or floss her teeth as an adult? That would make ME fucking uncomfortable, especially considering that her mouth probably touches your mouth.", "NTA\n\nThere was no way to know she'd be uncomfortable with you doing what billions of people do each evening.", "Bro run she sounds insane. NTA", "NTA\n\nSooooooooooo, if you get married, are you supposed to let your teeth rot out of your head because her dental hygiene is sub-par?  \n\nUghh.  As if!", "Nope, NTA. If there was any bedroom fun before/after this, hygiene is always a good idea. \n\nAlso, no dealing with stanky night breathe or morning breathe all morning when you both are getting ready for the day?? Who the heck is offended by that? That shit should be appreciated.", "NTA.  You'd better not tell her about cleaning your ass after you use the toilet.  That might end your relationship.", "NTA - that doesn't sound like a very strict routine to me, just normal.  I don't see how you could have known that it would make her uncomfortable.  She has some major issues, which may be a red flag for the future of this relationship.", "I personally think you should run. Fast. I bet this is just the tip of the iceberg. NTA.", "Holy shit. Your gf\u2019s argument consists of the dumbest logic I\u2019ve ever read. \n\nShoving it in her face?? It\u2019s not offensive to brush your teeth at your SO\u2019s place, it\u2019s actually pretty disgusting not to? WTF?? \n\nNTA", "I had a bunch of cavities growing up but I love brushing my teeth with a strict routine now. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Talk about a flag on the play!! Taking care of your teeth, basically yourself, is a quality and don't you ever doubt that!! Even if she had problems with her teeth when younger it shouldn't warrant that kind of reaction(my teeth are just the worst still). \n Unless she doesn't care for them properly so she basically felt shame and instead of owning that to herself she shat on you. NTA", "The story as you tell it certainly leads to a NTA vote, so that's what I'll go with but I do wonder how long \"5 minutes\" actually was and what else had gone on to trigger such a reaction. \n\nIt feels like important information is being left out.", "NTA. I was not aware dental history is a routine subject during dating. /s", "NTA and you should floss first, when you floss you bring out all the bacteria from between your teeth, you need to brush or mouth wash it away and not just leave it in your mouth", "NTA. I think that's nice that you are concerned for your dental hygiene, and that you are considerate enough to brush before going to bed with you partner. I think she needs to relax about her teeth. Did you even know about her dental issues until she told you? Keep taking care of your own teeth. You want them to last you the next 70 years.", "Wait so she didn't brush her teeth before going to sleep? I can see why she has cavities. NTA", "Why is OP's dental hygiene an issue here? If OP didn't brush and/or floss his teeth then I would say there is an issue but there isn't. The GF is overreacting for nothing.", "NTA\n\nWhat? Is she not brushing her teeth? \n\nTihs is weird.", "NTA and I would take that as a big red flag honestly.", "NTA. How were you to know that she is nasty and doesn't brush at night? Also, who asks someone what they were doing in the bathroom? Run as fast as you can before she thinks something else benign is an attack on her.", "NTA", "NTA And good for you for taking care of your teeth and gums! There is a lot of research showing that people who do that outlive those with poor oral hygiene and have a lower rate of heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, respiratory diseases like colds and flu, and other chronic illnesses.

How on Earth were you supposed to know she doesn't brush her teeth? It is smart to have a travel toothbrush and floss. Good for you.", "Her not having a dental routine is her problem, not yours. \n\nWhat does she expect you to do, let your teeth rot because she can\u2019t bother to keep up with her dental hygiene? Ridiculous. \n\nAs for the \u2018inadequacies\u2019, those can easily be solved with\u2026*drumroll*\u2026incorporating a dental routine.        \n\n\nNTA.", "Wtf\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d bro what.

I have a horrendous fear of losing my teeth (trauma from a shitty dentist when I was a child), and I am beyond religious with my dental care routine at home. Every morning, and every evening. I honestly don't think I could keep my tenuous grasp on sanity if I was forced to skip even one brushing or flossing.\n\nNTA.", "Inadvertent fat = ugly comment here, but I get what you are saying. \n\nHow dare this man\u2026brush his teeth?? /sigh", "I didn\u2019t want to say it outright so I\u2019m glad you did. But dude. This girl ain\u2019t it.", "In this case I call it a cock blocker.  Dude was on his way to home plate and the tripped over with the dental kit on the way there.", "Yeah he\u2019s the AH for this reason alone. Absolutely mental", "My wife and I have the same disagreement. Ideally, brush, floss, brush again. \ud83d\ude02", "Isn't using mouthwash not as good as it's been advertised too?", "I was hoping to take notes!", "I read somewhere recently that the US is actually unique in not bringing dental kits places. A lot of cultures value dental hygiene more than we do here, and they'll go brush their teeth after lunch at work, etc.", "This reminds me of a job i had many years ago, at an eye doctor's office teaching patients how to wear and care for contact lenses. One guy wanted to know if it was ok to sleep with them on; I told him absolutely not given the type he had purchased.\n\nIt turns out this issue was what if he got lucky? It would be sooooo embarrassing to have to take out his contacts and rinse and put them away before sleeping. I was like dude, if you cant handle that level of personal, you have no business having sex with the person!\n\nNTA OP, keep up the good dental hygiene.", "Maybe he always has one in his car just in case. You never know when you're going to need to brush!", "I mean, good teeth and hygeine are must have traits in a man, as far as I am concerned.\nShe's got issues and this is probably just the tip of iceberg. Jealousy, paranoia, gaslighting, projecting, does not make for a happy relationship. Run.", "Excellent", "NTA. That has got to be a first.", "Dude.... if my husband had one of these on hand when we first started dating and brushed and flossed his teeth before bedroom fun.... No problem for me on that one!!!!  I would have let him go down on me A LOT more, and the thoughtfulness would have been MUCH appreciated. \n\nAnd after??? Sweet, I don't have to taste p**** breathe when I kiss him when we're done.", "This made me laugh. <French kiss> Must brush...second hand halitosis.", "Doggamnit, I feel like a moron now. I NEVER thought about keeping one on hand just in case.... would have been so wonderful to have one after an unexpected night away from home... \n\nThe amount of nights I ended up either crashing on random couches or beds sometimes in my younger years and waking up feeling extra gross was too many... gaaaahhh, I think not having one of these in my car might be my turning into my one lifetime regret.... \n\nFrick. Welp at least I know the one solid piece of advice I'll be giving my future kids.", "I don\u2019t know why but I love this realization and comment so much", "Nope, we all learn something new. The Better Half keeps a small overnight bag in his trunk and comes home every night but has a long commute and just in case of bad weather if he has to stay at a hotel. Plus, if I overdid it on the garlic in the meal he takes for lunch.", "The dentist literally gives you a new brush, toothpaste and floss 2 times a year. Stick it in a ziploc and into your glove box.", "Hahaha well it's the simple things in life really. Little tricks like this make me wildly happy lol.", "Lol mine doesn't, hasn't since I was a teenager unless I specifically ask.", "Lmao oh my god getting offended that you brush your teeth ?! Wow your in for a sh*t show with this girl\u2026. NTA", "NTA. This isn\u2019t even a strict hygiene routine. When you said dental kit I assumed you were going to grab an explorer and start scraping plaque off of your teeth. But you\u2019re doing normal stuff. She has a hang up about something you weren\u2019t even aware of. Honestly, this relationship is new enough that I feel okay with saying you should duck out.", "Dude, I\u2019ve been that person with crappy teeth. And you know what? I learned how to take care of them. NTA, idk what her problem is but make no mistake; this is a problem with her, not with you.", "NTA. Somehow I doubt it had anything to do with your teeth regimen. That just seems bizarre. Maybe she thought you were doing something else and got herself worked up.", "NTA - I\u2019ve spent tens of thousands in fixing my teeth because my family neglected me all of my life. Never take decent teeth for granted. This girl needs to take accountability for brushing her damn teeth every night. You should probably walk away because this will always be an issue with her. She\u2019s got the maturity level of a potato.", "NTA. You are you, and you have a dental kit. More power to you! You will have healthy teeth when other people you know are getting extractions and root canals. That's who you are, and congratulations to whoever taught you the value of this.\n\nBut I'd be concerned about your GF's response to this. Why would she think your looking after yourself is somehow taking a potshot at her? That's really not a strong psychological place she's coming from. My daughter's father carried suspicion like that around all the years I knew him; I was often on the receiving end of it and it was crazy-making!", "This is soooo bizarre. NTA. Why does you taking care of your hygiene mean anything about hers? So so bizarre that she\u2019s turning your absolutely benign behavior into something about her that she is insecure about. Hope it doesn\u2019t turn into a pattern. But I guess you\u2019ll find out!", "NTA. But it feels weird you went to your car instesd of asking her for a spare tooth brush.", "NTA\nSounds like this is a deep seated issue for her, and you stepped on a land mine.  Give her a chance to process this rather than just write her reaction in the moment into stone.\n\nBut she's gotta recognize that this has nothing to do with you.", "NTA. Normal people appreciate a partner having good hygiene habits", "Uhh what?\n\nI have insecurities with my teeth, but I sure as hell won't begrudge someone who takes good care of their own! Maybe it's a bit surprising that of all things in you car, it's a dental kit, but my friend keeps a to go bag with all hygiene/med/extra clothes/etc in hers just in case. It's not unheard of and she's just projecting that bitterness onto you. Especially if she doesn't keep up with dental hygiene the way you do  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. as a dental hygienist I am simultaneously impressed and proud of you lol. Keep at it!!", "Runnnnnnnnnnnn save yourself and your teeth", "NTA. I had a lot of dental problems growing up. If a girl had a dental kit, I'd say more power to you.", "> she had multiple cavities\n\nI also had cavities as a kid, and what I learned is that I have to take great care of my teeth. Electric toothbrush, mouthwash and floss, but still, that takes 5 minutes or less. Her reaction to his completely normal routine was weird.", "When you take a shower and shove her stinkiness in her face.", "You put this better than I did. Her behavior really troubles me. Does she think everyone around her is watching her, or trying to bring her down? Kinda creepy.", "My thoughts exactly", "Yeah, and it's not even over the top. It's simple dental care.", "Dental kit makes perfect sense to me even though I might use different words.\n\nWhen we have a forum that includes people from nations all over the world, with  lots of non native English speakers, word choice is probably NOT the thing to focus on.", "Why can't a guy hope, and be prepared?  It's not like most women don't know that most single men will accept an invitation to get laid at the drop of a hat.", "So you don't brush your teeth throughout the day? It's perfectly normal for some to pack a toothbrush to work or school or anywhere. Nothing presumptuous about that. It's presumptuous if OP had a whole sleepover bag ready for the date. But who knows, maybe OP is one of those who packs an emergency \"what if I need to get changed or spend the night\" bags in their car, regardless if they have a date or not.", "Presumptuous to hope to get laid and still want to keep up his oral hygiene?\n\nIt's not like he said, \"I brought my dental kit, so you have to sleep with me!\"", "Hope and preparation for the score!", "A friend always has a slighter bigger purse and she always has a small toiletries bag in it. It has a toothbrush with the toothpaste built in, rinse free bath wipes, a contact lens case filled with solution, deodorant, a pair of underwear and a pair of socks.", "The best things to have in an unexpected overnight kit are:\n- toothbrush/toothpaste \n- deodorant\n- folding hairbrush/comb and hair ties if you have long hair\n- socks \n- underwear\n- can also be nice to get a little solid perfume or sample size perfume/cologne to put in there.\n\nWearing the same pants two days in a row is normal, wearing yesterday\u2019s shirt? Probably no big deal. But socks and underwear get *icky* after a single day. And having a toothbrush and deodorant help keep you fresh, and the hair care stuff is obvious. The perfume sample is something extra nice and is important if you might have to be in public for an extended time the next day because your shirt *will* start smelling.\n\nI have one of these kits put together in a little makeup pouch from Ipsy and it just lives at the bottom of my bag and I\u2019ve been very grateful to have it with me a few times!", "> The amount of nights I ended up either crashing on random couches or beds sometimes in my younger years \n\nWhen I was in uni and didn't have a car, I'd put a bit of toothpaste on my finger and \"brush\" my teeth with it, which, of course, was a shit method, lol. But it did make me feel a bit less gross.\n\nBut keeping one in your car takes no effort and it can be a lifesaver when you're as anal as oral hygiene as I am. At  least there's something I do well in my life \ud83d\ude02", "Real world advice is always welcome."]}
