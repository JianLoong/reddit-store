So Bob invites me to hang out with him and a friend of his, let's say Jim, and tells me beforehand that Jim has been having a rough time financially, so we make a plan where Bob will buy us all lunch, and then I will buy dinner. No problem.\n\nSo the 3 of us eat lunch, and the bill ends up at about \\~$75 total; not cheap, but not too bad. Bob pays for it as planned.\n\nLater on, Bob and Jim are planning for dinner. Bob feels like having steak, so Jim asks me if that's alright, and I respond with something like \"sure, that's fine\". He double checks to make sure it's ok, but I want to help, and I don't mind if it's a bit more expensive than lunch. So Bob and Jim discuss options. I'm not consulted - I don't live there, so I don't know what's good, anyway. I trust their judgement.\n\nThe only thing I know about the place is \"they sell steak\". I'm mentally prepared for something on the expensive side - say, $150 total. I'm ok with that much.\n\nThen we walk in the door. ...This place is fancy, uh-oh. Menus come. The average plate cost is \\~$75. I am astounded, and awkwardly say like, \"Uh, wow, this place is like...really expensive.\" Jim concurs, and again asks if I'm sure I want to pay for dinner. Awkward subtle negotiation follows, in which I explain I was expecting at most $150 and persist that I can at least cover that much. (Jim has eaten here several times, and Bob knew the prices.)\n\nNote: I have a pretty nice job, and this wouldn't have caused me true problems, merely stung. But I feel like just because I CAN afford it doesn't make it ok to EXPECT me to, especially without warning. I seldom eat out, in large part because it's expensive. Bob knows this about me.\n\nSo I buy something on the low end \\~$45; Bob picks the cheaper of two options \\~$70; Jim orders something \\~$90. A few drinks ordered. I'm angry with Bob, but act normal; I don't want to cause more of a scene in front of Bob's friend. After eating, the check comes. With taxes and tip, it's \\~$300. I pay, and in the car Jim hands me $150, and I mumble thanks/apology.\n\nLater I send Bob a text to tell him that what happened was not ok, and that I didn't appreciate them picking such an expensive place without consulting me, especially because it ended up being Jim who paid the extra which was the opposite of what we wanted! I then add that I don't want to take turns paying for meals anymore (A Bob tradition that I've long found uncomfy); that hanging out should be about time with friends and not negotiations. I later add that I do appreciate him setting up the day for us though.\n\nA few days later he calls me, and says calmly that I went back on my word, he felt humiliated in front of Jim, I put a price on our friendship, and we're no longer friends. My response was that he demanded something unreasonable of me, and it wasn't ok.\n\nI hate conflict, and I feel bad that he was so upset. What do you guys think?

This whole one person pays for meals for everyone rotation business is asking for trouble, because it always works out that one person ends up with a huge bill and others sometimes end up paying way less for their turn.

He obviously chose the cheaper of the two meals THEN picks an expensive place. Jim also chose to have a good time knowing that he was on someone else's dime while having financial problems.

It's Bob that put the price on your friendship, not you.", "Bob knew what he was doing when he offered to buy lunch versus dinner. Lunch is the cheaper option. If he insists again, you take lunch and give Bob dinner.", "why would you accept money from the friend who is struggling financially if you wanted to help him like you said. discussing your anger at the situation with Bob is warranted but you shouldn't have accepted money from Jim who triple checked if you were okay with paying.", "ESH except Jim. I think you and Bob should have agreed on a budget before you went out for lunch and dinner. That would have 100% spared the awkwardness of \u201cis it ok if I get\u2026\u201d which is just so uncomfortable. What you guys did for Jim was really nice but unfortunately due to poor planning, he was left feeling like a burden and forked out $150. When I go out with my friends I tell them what I\u2019m okay with spending on a meal and we work around that. If the lines for communication were more open instead of tangled up in the money dance it would have saved a lot of trouble.", "ESH. Planning/communication fail on both your and Bob's part.\n\nIf the idea was for you and Bob to cover Jim's meals, then you could have just said \"we'll split the tab\" on both lunch and dinner---instead of him covering lunch (obviously cheaper) and you doing dinner.\n\nBut the rest of it? When they started floating restaurant ideas, why didn't you look online to see the menu and price range? Instead, you just blindly went along.", "Hmm NTA i think, that whole concept is iffy to me, might as well just go dutch or pay your own, its not even like this.\n\nId be happy to buy food for a couple of friends, but would not be impressed if they chose somewhere incredibly expensive and ordered expensive dishes.\n\nImo, this is the equivalent to saying, hey can you help me pay for a trip somewhere, and rather than getting a \u00a3100 flight they choose first class at \u00a31000 and expect you to pay.", "Info:  They asked you many times about steak you said fine.  Then you saw prices and again said it was fine.  Why not just say you didn\u2019t budget for such an expensive place and go elsewhere??", "ESH. Since you were paying for the meal, you should have taken the lead the on the restaurant selection. You should never trust anyone else to look out for your finances. Bob should have chosen a more reasonably priced restaurant and he shouldn\u2019t have gotten mad at you for standing my your budget.", "NTA but your friend is. He should have picked up the tab for him and his friend, not you.", "NTA.  Jim double checked twice that OP was OK with the choice of restaurant. And when OP said  it was more than he expected, Jim said he'd help covered the cost and *ordered the most expensive meal* of the 3 and that was *double* the price of what OP ordered. He could have ordered a less costly dinner if he, too, was worried about cost.  \n\nThey could have left and gone somewhere less expensive.

Dinner ALWAYS costs more.", "Bob is the arsehole. You and Jim, NTA.\n\nFunny how Bob got to pay $75 for all 3, then ordered a $70 steak for himself and drinks.

People like Bob and Jim take advantage of people like you who they think they can push around easily.\n\nYou went to visit Bob. Jim is a stranger to you, so you should never have agreed to pay for him. If Bob wants to float his friend, that's his choice. But you did, so...\n\nThen when Bob suggested he buy lunch and you buy dinner, you should have said no. It's obvious that lunch costs more than dinner.\n\nThen when they asked about steak, you should have said no. Steak restaurants are typically more expensive than average restaurants.\n\nThey were using you. If you're down on finances you should not be allowing your friends to float your lunch *and* dinner. That's crazy. But if you are mooching, it's 100% worse to suggest an expensive restaurant and buy a costly meal.", "NTA- you and bob could have split both meals. It would have come to $187.50; a little more than you wanted to spend, a lot more than bob Wanted to spend.", "Jim is NTA. Your friend is because he knew dinner would be more $. You for accepting the $ from Jim.", "NTA. Bob used you and is now gaslighting you about it.", "Sorry but YTA\n\nIf you knew that you had a set ceiling when it came to the total bill, the time to make that declaration was when Jim asked \"Is steak ok?\". You response should have been that steak is fine, but as you do not know the local restaurants you would just like to keep the meal under $150-$200. You were well within your rights to alert them of a limit.\n\nEveryone in the modern age has a cell phone that is perfectly able to look up local restaurants, see the reviews and the price indication of said establishment ($, $$, $$$, $$$$). Had you bothered to asked the name of the restaurant before agreeing you would have been aware of their price point.\n\nYou had another opportunity(keeping in mind, the longer it is into this outing the more uncomfortable it becomes) to address the situation when you sat and actually saw the prices on the menu. No one FORCED you to remain there or to order anything, and you could have just insisted that you all find another restaurant.\n\nThis was all a factor of your discomfort with confrontation, though honestly I never understood people who use that issue when it comes to speaking up because what usually happens is EXACTLY this, where you allow the situation to play out knowing full well that you do not approve and waiting until it is all said and done to actually confront it which is much worse and MUCH more uncomfortable.\n\nSorry, next time speak up and let your concerns/opinions be heard BEFORE it gets out of hand.", "YTA. You didn't tell Bob what your limit was, didn't check the prices beforehand, and agreed to everything when Bob double checked with you. Were they supposed to read your mind to know what you were willing to spend? I think Bob is slightly TA for letting Jim pay when it was supposed to be a treat for him and also for choosing such an expensive place without explicitly telling you, I would never choose an expensive place when someone else is paying. But then again, you agreed to everything and didn't make an effort to double check. Maybe he assumed you were well off and that's why you didn't ask about prices. You should've paid for the dinner and learned your lesson to communicate more clearly next time.", "ESH, it seems like bob was trying to use you. Especially with the whole \u201cJim had been having a rough time financially\u201d but it doesn\u2019t sound like you communicated with him. You never communicated price points or checked prices for that matter, it\u2019s not that hard.

That\u2019s honestly very nice that he wants to do that for his friend who has having \u201cfinancial troubles.\u201d And that\u2019s on him to do. You don\u2019t even know this guy! I would feel so awkward if I were Jim and my friend (Bob) is asking his friends to pay for things for me? \n\nAlso, as has already been mentioned, (especially considering that Jim is part of Bob party) Bob knows that dinner is pricier than lunch. Everyone knows this. Bob should have offered to get dinner for the group, and you get lunch. \n\nYou\u2019re TA for not speaking up sooner. Sounds like they, especially Jim, asked multiple times if the restaurant was okay? Those were your opportunities to check it out on your phone. $100/person is about the going/average rate for a dinner at a nice steakhouse plus a drink or two and taxes/tip. Yes, it is a lot of money, but it\u2019s not unusual or unexpected. \n\n\nI would chalk all of this up to a learning experience.", "ESH - YOU bought \"a pig in the poke\".  You agreed to pay for dinner, which is always more expensive than lunch.  Your friend, for locking you into a deal that was unfair.  JIm, for letting other people pay for his meals AND THEN ORDERING EXPENSIVE ITEMS. \n\nBTW, YOU are far better off without a \"friend\" like Bob!", "YTA\n\nThis is poor communication on your behalf. Nobody had an issue with paying besides you, so it\u2019s your job to voice what you\u2019re comfortable with paying. Saying you can only pay $150 once you guys are already seated in that restaurant is a major AH move. These guys aren\u2019t mind readers. You had zero right to be angry. If price was going to be a big deal to you, you should\u2019ve told Bob before he picked that restaurant that you wanted to dine somewhere more affordable or within your range. You didn\u2019t do that and instead humiliated your friends and came off as extremely cheap and rude. It\u2019s not really surprising that Bob wants nothing to do with you anymore.\n\nWhile Bobs tradition might be strange, you\u2019re still TA for voicing your frustration with it only once it backfired on you and you had to pay for the most expensive meal.

He\u2019s the AH.", "NTA, especially since you established you didn't want to carry on this weird little tradition. You set a clear boundary, and Bob didn't like it. That's on him, not you.", "I'm not sure what you're used to, but in my area a main dish at a steak restaurant costs $50-$70. So expecting the entire meal to cost $150-$200 would be unrealistic, and frankly kind of naive.\n\nEven if everyone ordered a $50 main ($150 total), add in two drinks per person ($60), a starter ($20), tip (20%), and tax (7%), and you can estimate $295 *minimum*.\n\nI don't want to call you an AH because I think you made an innocent mistake, but you could have avoided embarrassment with a tiny amount of research and math", "NTA", "NTA - I hate doing the one person pays the bill between friends, there\u2019s always some little expectation or someone feeling like they got screwed or taken advantage of as a result. \n\nAlso, some people don\u2019t really understand that if one person is paying the bill they probably don\u2019t want to pay for your $11 martini on top of a steak and appetizers. \n\nWhen the in-laws take us out they always get multiple appetizers and steaks, drinks, dessert, you name it, at every meal.

OP said $150 was fine, and when they saw the prices they said they were uncomfortable with it. if you seriously can\u2019t see that Bob is a shitty friend, you\u2019re probably the person who does this to your \u201cfriends\u201d too.", "Not that I\u2019m going to claim it\u2019s high quality, but I *can* get a steak at Applebee\u2019s for <$20. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have expected a $300 price tag for three people just because it\u2019s \u201csteak\u201d.\n\nBob was definitely the asshole trying to pull one over on OP", "I agree, he said it was fine, but it also sounds like they led him along and got him to agree to a bunch of little yeses at a time. \n\ncan you do your part and pay for dinner if i get lunch - easy yes\n\nwould steaks be ok? - yeah i love outback/medium priced steakhouse\n\nthis place looks fancy, but not all fancy places have extremely expensive meals - so ok, this is fine\n\nfinally get menu, sees prices are average $75 plus drinks and appetizers, are expensive tip puts it over the top - now what\u2019s he supposed to do, barge out of the restaurant?\n\nif he was told from the start you are expected to pay for a $300 plus dinner when it\u2019s not a special occasion, he\u2019s have said no very quickly, it\u2019s an old sales trick that gets people every time\n\nnot saying it was malicious, but it begs the question", "How is OP the victim? While I do think it's weird and in bad taste of Bob to ask his friend to pay dinner for a stranger and then choose a really expensive restaurant, OP could've said no at any point and set boundaries. If Bob had invited Jim along and then just left so OP would have to pay or if he'd lied to OP about what and where they were going to eat, it would be a different story. But they both agreed to split it weirdly and OP was asked TWICE if steak was fine, which even I know is expensive and I've never eaten steak. Even if Bob was taking advantage of OP being nice and not knowing the area, google is free. Who agrees to pay for dinner and doesn't check the prices beforehand or communicates how much they are willing to spend? Bob doesn't strike me as a nice person, but he didn't do anything wrong here except that he let Jim pay in the end when he wasn't supposed to pay anything at all. If anything, Jim is the victim here, told he'd be treated to lunch and dinner and then ending up paying more than Bob and as much as OP did.", "I\u2019m not 100% attacking OP I\u2019m just saying OP was negligent and an AH to himself.  He had 3 opportunities to back out of an expensive dinner.  He willingly agreed to go for steak.  By me at a steakhouse even the chicken cost 30 dollars a person.\n\nI would never willingly pay for steak for others.  Yet OP said it was fine twice.\n\nSo while he\u2019s not an AH and his friends are he failed to do his due diligence. He had many opportunities to communicate his preferences *before* they sat down for dinner.", "I don\u2019t eat steak so it\u2019s all the same to me lol but agreed they suck for wanting to go to the expensive steakhouse on some else\u2019s dime.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying the OP was an AH to himself.  He failed to properly communicate and state his desires.  He should have stated his budget when deciding places.  Sure steaks fine but have to keep it around X amount.\n\nThey stuck for choosing an expensive place without properly communicating it.  Also for choosing expensive meals on somebody else\u2019s dime.\n\nI know when I offer to pay I research a place before I agree to pay for it.  \n\nMight get downvoted for this but oh well.\n\nESH.", "> OP could\u2019ve said no at any point \n\nhe did. \n\n> Even if Bob was taking advantage of OP being nice and not knowing the area, google is free. \n\nAKA, \u201ceven though Bob is an AH who takes advantage of their \u201cfriends\u201d, it\u2019s still OPs fault for getting taken advantage of.\u201d \n\nthis is *exactly* my point lol, someone treats their friend like crap and people on here find a way to make it the friends fault over technicalities.", "I mean agree to disagree, but they took a clueless out of towner to an expensive restaurant unsuspectingly and ran up the bill on him. No friend would do that.", "I see your point, but you can't sit there and agree to everything that's suggested and then be like \"whaaat, this steak restaurant is expensive? But I'm only willing to pay x amount!\" when you had every opportunity to check it out before going or set a budget. Both very normal things OP didn't do. It's not like Bob surprised OP with steak, he was asked if he was fine with that. If a friend was nonchalant about paying for steak and didn't care about which restaurant to go to, I'd assume they were well off too. While it isn't nice to pick an expensive place and not mention it, I think it was very obvious that it was going to be expensive and that OP would have to pay more than Bob, even before they arrived at the restaurant. OP's an adult and he should really learn to set boundaries. Therefore, I think calling OP a victim is a bit much, calling Bob an asshole, I can get behind.", "Agreed about them not being friends.  However I always make sure I know what I\u2019m agreeing to before I agree to it blindly.\n\nHave a good day nice discussion."]}
