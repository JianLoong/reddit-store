I\u2019m just wondering, as someone who has been inpatient and who has a dad who takes mental health very seriously, if they\u2019re having a strong reaction out of concern, but are going about it all wrong.

Honestly, they don\u2019t owe you more than that if this has been going on a for long time. (Aside from having to follow procedures that protect your legal rights.)\n\nPerhaps your parents set ground rules and boundaries for everyone\u2019s sake.

Regardless, you had an argument with your parents, and ran out and turned your location off.\n\nCan you, just for a moment, put yourself in their shoes and think of the terror they went through not knowing if you were going to harm yourself again?\n\nParents are not superhuman. People don\u2019t get to your stage of mental health/ drug issues overnight. Maybe your parents have done all they can.\n\nYou have a small windows of opportunity to get your life back on track - by living according to their/ agreed upon rules - while you still have a roof over your head.\n\nTheir next step could be to evict you.\n\nI hope you will take this as a wake up call.

If you don't know what it is, talk to them.", "Don't lie to yourself, you've done things that make them think that way. Guaranteed, shitty situation anyways. 18 shouldn't be considered an adult tbh.
