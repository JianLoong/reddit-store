However, I doubt your sister is following an age-appropriate sleep schedule if this 1yo is waking up from a 3 hour nap at 5pm. Babies that age should be getting 2-3 hours of daytime sleep *total* - as in, split between typically 2 naps/day (mine was on 1 nap/day at 1yo but she was early and 1 nap/day would mean nap in middle of day not late afternoon). Probably why the baby isn't sleeping through the night yet, too, if they're getting way too much daytime sleep.", "NTA. Not your monkeys, not your circus.", "She signed up for the sleepless nights,  not you. NTA. I have kids and this comes with the territory. She's just jealous.", "NTA", "I'm torn on this one. As others have said, a child could wake at 5:00 and still go to sleep at bedtime, possibly 8;00 rather than 7:00 as it's often a three hour cycle. It's entirely possible that the child would still sleep through. It's more the expectation from the parents that is the issue, that someone will sleep in the living room so they can both work nights. However I think at that late stage you could have done that one night, just then said never again, rather than one of them presumably missing work last minute. At 19 I imagine you can probably cope with one broken night. I'd probably have done the night then ripped them to shreds about it the next day.", "NTA\n\nThey chose to have children so it's on them to find child care.\n\nIt's no wonder the children keep them up at night if they are putting the kids down for naps until 5. No kid is going to be tired enough to go back to bed 2 hours later unless they are sick.\n\nGood on you OP for saying no and sticking to it.", "So she lied about you being able to sleep and got you over there on false pretenses and\u2026 she\u2019s trying to call you the AH? LMAO NTA you did great. Way to stick to your guns.", ">there is no way a kid is waking up from at 5pm from a nap and going back to bed 2 hours later\n\nThis is actually just factually incorrect. 1 year Olds DO wake up from a 3hour nap then go to bed for the night 2 hours later. The problem isn't actually the nap, the problem is with scheduling and since sister mentioned sleepless nights, her kids probably don't have a schedule. A 1 year old on a schedule absolutely should be taking a 3 hour nap, waking up, playing and feeding, then going down for a 8-12 hour overnight sleep. Sleep begets sleep in babies. \n\nSource: Healthy Sleep Habits - Happy Child by Dr. Marc Weissbluth. It is the definitive western science on sleep science for babies/toddlers/children. \n\nNote: I agree with NTA, I agree with your point.
