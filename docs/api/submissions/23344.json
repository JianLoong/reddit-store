If it was, she could've easily gotten a real babysitter.", "Nta\n\nShe lied, there is no way a kid is waking up at 5pm from a nap and going back to bed 2 hours later. They need the money, and apparently they think you *don't* need money, because them working is more important than you working. \n\nThey are parents, so they can't *both* work night shifts anymore. If one is day, one is night, so be it, if they become passing trains in the night for the next couple years, it's what they chose by becoming parents.", "NTA it's their kids why should you ever suffer sleepless nights because of them", "Nta\n\nYou are doing someone a favour and they try and bait and switch you by lying. Not acceptable.\n\nCancel move on.\n\nIf anyone asks why you would cancel last minute the only acceptable answer is because it was the last minute when you discovered that sister was lying to you.", "NTA. But woo boy, is your sister an AH. She thinks it\u2019s \u201ca small ask\u201d and \u201cnot a big deal if you have one sleepless night\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201chard for her to be sympathetic\u201d because she thinks she and her life choices are more important than you and that her needs take precedence over yours. She seems to feel very superior to you because she\u2019s older and has children.

There is no way that child will go back to sleep 2 hours later. What on earth was your sister thinking.", "Definitely NTA. And I applaud your extremely mature way of handling it. With that being said, continue that  mindset and don\u2019t even reply to the text.  If you already did, don\u2019t engage any further.

They should have regular childcare arrangements in place. Not to mention, it should be obvious that unless they have a regular babysitter, both parents can't work the same shift. I had friends who worked opposite shifts (one did days, the other nights) until their youngest was in kindergarten because they couldn't afford daycare. They did what they had to do. These are your sister's kids, not yours and if someone needs to have a sleepless night, it's your sister.", "So she lied to you and then got angry of the consequences of her lies?

Your sister sucks.", "Good for you!!   For not caving when she proved that she didn't care one whit about your schedule, only about her own needs.\n\nNTA.  You're awesome.

Srtop babysitting for her.", "NTA, she tried to trick you and got found out. No more babysitting for her.", "Oh wow. I was so ready to call you TA for making assumptions about the kid's sleep schedule and canceling for probably no reason (my one-year-old can easily nap until 5, then go down at 7:45 and sleep through the night until 7 or later), but then I got to the point where your sister revealed she expected the kids to keep you up all along. Big NTA.", "Is she even paying you?\n\n> it's such a small ask and that the kids keep her and her husband awake all the time and it's not a big deal\n\nLol no. They ain\u2019t your kids. Good on you for standing up for yourself, NTA.", "ESH\n\nLots of one-year-olds will wake from a 3 hour nap at 5pm, and then sleep through the night again at 8. So your assumption that he wasn't going to go to sleep is probably false. Afternoon naps are completely normal for one-year-old children.\n\nI was all set on calling you the asshole until your sister admitted that she had been lying to you, and that her younger kid does not in fact sleep through the night. Because \"can you sleep in my house because I can't leave my kids alone in the house while they are sleeping\" is a completely different request from \"my one year old will be up half the night. Can you babysit?\"\n\nSo the only reason I'm calling you an AH at all is that you didn't know she'd been lying about her kid's sleep patterns until after you bailed out on her.", "This is a hard one but I'm going to say YTA. But your sister was too. It was wrong of her to push that on you, and to risk your sleep. But it's also wrong of you to cancel at the last minute when you had agreed and they were counting on you. IMO you should have stayed and when she came back made it clear you wouldn't be babysitting for her again in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
