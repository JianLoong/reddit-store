However, I doubt your sister is following an age-appropriate sleep schedule if this 1yo is waking up from a 3 hour nap at 5pm. Babies that age should be getting 2-3 hours of daytime sleep *total* - as in, split between typically 2 naps/day (mine was on 1 nap/day at 1yo but she was early and 1 nap/day would mean nap in middle of day not late afternoon).

As others have said, a child could wake at 5:00 and still go to sleep at bedtime, possibly 8;00 rather than 7:00 as it's often a three hour cycle. It's entirely possible that the child would still sleep through. It's more the expectation from the parents that is the issue, that someone will sleep in the living room so they can both work nights. However I think at that late stage you could have done that one night, just then said never again, rather than one of them presumably missing work last minute. At 19 I imagine you can probably cope with one broken night. I'd probably have done the night then ripped them to shreds about it the next day.", "NTA\n\nThey chose to have children so it's on them to find child care.\n\nIt's no wonder the children keep them up at night if they are putting the kids down for naps until 5.

LMAO NTA you did great. Way to stick to your guns.", ">there is no way a kid is waking up from at 5pm from a nap and going back to bed 2 hours later\n\nThis is actually just factually incorrect. 1 year Olds DO wake up from a 3hour nap then go to bed for the night 2 hours later. The problem isn't actually the nap, the problem is with scheduling and since sister mentioned sleepless nights, her kids probably don't have a schedule. A 1 year old on a schedule absolutely should be taking a 3 hour nap, waking up, playing and feeding, then going down for a 8-12 hour overnight sleep.

NTA, your sister is a liar full stop, she intentionally tried to trick you OP.  And then tried to act like you were in the wrong?  Dishonesty, self-entitlement and accusation = never babysit for her again, she\u2019s a liar and a user.", "Cool story, not relevant since the sister admitted that the kids would have kept OP up after telling OP that they would sleep through the night since OP needed a good night's rest.", "Right, toddlers sleep a lot more than people think, simply because they're so chaotic when they don't.", "Yeah, I was thinking that a one year old going back to sleep at a reasonable bedtime after a long afternoon nap isn't really all that far out there, but then sister outed herself.", "Yes it's not unusual. But there is also a chance that the child will not sleep again till midnight or even longer which the OP did not sign up for.", "I'm a parent and you're very much NTA. For one, they're not your kids. Also, it's not like you could just lock them in their rooms at bedtime and go to sleep or something. Your sister needs to figure her childcare out in a way that doesn't involve you.", "NTA.  They\u2019re not your kids, it\u2019s not at all your responsibility to give up any sleep whatsoever on their behalf.", "NTA. She straight up lied to you about the sleeping schedule. Maybe the kids wouldn't keep them awake if they didn't sleep for 3 hours only 2 hours before bedtime.", ">and it's not a big deal for me to have just one sleepless night\n\nShe knew exactly what she was doing and she lied to you. Definitely NTA. Don't fall for it ever again. Not your kids, not your sleeplessness.", "At my baby shower (before my daughter was born a month later), a former SIL said to me, \u201cOnce you have kids, you never sleep through the night again.\u201d\n\n\nYeah, most times true\u2026it\u2019s called BEING A PARENT! All that crap/guilt the mom tried to lay on her younger sister about how \u201cthey get kept up all the time, the younger sis can have just one sleepless night/etc.\u201d was just total CRAP/BS!!! This is not the 19 yr old\u2019s problem that her older sister had kids! NTA", "NTA your sister is a liar!", "NTA.  She knew you would have a very late night.  She can not compare actual parenting at nights to doing someone a favour.  You have no kids and do not need to go through sleepless nights that go with parenting.", "Yeah, I caught that too!", "If a kid is taking a 3 hour nap and still sleeping mostly through the night, great! If this particular kid isn\u2019t sleeping through the night, I would probably start with not letting him take a 3 hour nap in the late afternoon. An hour maybe, or 3 hours a bit earlier in the day.", "op=NTA\n\nYou didn't want to do it--you caved with specific conditions attached.\n\nShe NEVER intended for you to be able to sleep through the Night. Sister should NOT have lied to you.  That sucks(guilting you also sucks)", "You are not an AH.  Your sister was deceptive with you.  I would have a hard time with ever babysitting again knowing she is willing to lie for her own benefit.  kt", "NTA. The kids keep them up all of the time because they are parents. They sign up for it when they decided to have sex trophies. You, however, did not. \n\nYou made the terms for babysitting very clear. Your sister agreed to those terms, lying to you because she admitted the children keep her and hubby up all of the time. Then tried to force you to babysit when she knew full well that the circumstances were no longer what had been agreed upon. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t agree to babysit for her ever again. Your sister doesn\u2019t respect your time, your job, or you in general. She can find and pay a babysitter.", "NTA.  She enjoyed having a quiet afternoon and did not care about child being up late.  Not her problem.  She can hire a live in care giver.", "not your circus not your monkeys. nta", "NTA but this whole situation makes me sad.\n\nHow can two parents both work the night shift? Do they just sleep all day and the babies are stuck in a playpen?\n\nDo they usually have a sitter for days?", "Given that I got that flair by having enough of whatever metric this subreddit uses to give them out, I don\u2019t know what you think you were trying to achieve with calling me by my AITA-given title \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nIt\u2019s not erroneous to point out that with this particular child, who the mom outright sister would give OP a sleepless night, it is going against the agreement made. OP\u2019s sister knew that having the baby wake up that late, it would result in a sleepless night for OP. What any other fucking child in the universe is able to do has no bearing on what that particular child does. Other children being able to go to sleep and sleep through the night two hours after waking up from a three hour nap has no bearing whatsoever on the child who doesn\u2019t. Just because plenty can doesn\u2019t mean that it is erroneous to say that a child whose fucking mother knows it would cause a sleepless night to isn\u2019t going to sleep through the night *when the fucking mother admitted it would be a sleepless night*! The erroneous comment is you pointing out that other children can go to sleep through the night after waking up from a three hour nap less than three hours before bed.", "I don\u2019t think your an asshole. Guess I just view things differently. I love taking care of my young family members despite not getting anything back in return, not being good with kids, or if it inconveniences me. Because they are family and they would do the same for me.", "NTA. It\u2019s called paying a sitter. They should have kept the kid up as long as possible, since you have work in the AM and this was a favour, with rest as a stipulation to the deal. They failed to uphold their end, they lost out on a babysitter. People treat family like free sitters. No, sorry. Your kid, your problem. And I say this as a parent x4. I would be ashamed to act like an entitled ass. My kids, my problem. My joy, too! But 100% my responsibility.", "NTA boy she is stupid, she just lost you as a 1 or 2 hour sitter for a very long time", "Nope, NTA\n\nShe lied about it and then dismissed your need to sleep. They need to take care of their own damn kids", "NTA\n\nDoes your BIL have a brother they could call to do unpaid child care?  There is always the presumption that women should provide free child care.  They should start calling male relatives first", "Well your kids aren't relevant here.", ">She said they both sleep through the night and they go to bed at 7pm\n\nThis is fucking **GREAT** news! I have a 3 weeks old baby and she wakes us up every 3-4 hours! \n\n7 more days to go until I can finally get a full night's rest again!\n\n(Optimism mode off)..\n\nNTA...", "I\u2019m a pretty flexible person, but these kids need to be on a consistent schedule especially if babysitting is required.  It took us awhile to get there but by the time a baby is a 1 yo his parents should have gotten him on a semi-regular bedtime.  (Variances will occur, they may be small, but they\u2019re people.)", "NTA. When will family members stop bestowing their own kids on their relatives? Not my kids, not my problem. Hire a babysitter and leave us alone.", "Actually, our kid does exactly that. He'll have his second to last meal of the day around 4-5-6, sleep 1-2 hours, eat his last meal of the day, and sleep 10-12 hours through the night. At almost 6 months. \n\nNow, I don't know if the kid in question does this, but it's not impossible. \n\nBut that is beside the point. OP is NTA, and has every right to nope out of babysitting if she feels like her sister isn't trustworthy. Nobody, except the parents, is responsible for taking care of those kids, and it seems like OP's sister tried to pull a fast one. \n\nGuess she learned that FAFO is a thing..."]}
