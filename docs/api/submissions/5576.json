In fact, the majority of wine we see in stores today won\u2019t age for very long at all.\u201d\n\nHence my statement that most wines don\u2019t improve with age.\n\nYour statement \u201cIt can ruin some wine but not all\u201d is the opposite of the common knowledge that \u201cIt ruins Most wine\u201d", "Thank you wish you could tell this to the other comments that keep telling me it\u2019s spoiled and rotten", "Brother, I know exactly what ageing food is. I know what rotten food is too. Thank you for the vocabulary lesson, but it's not needed. NTA anyway, you like your food rotten and your mother should respect that.", "Even then, they didn't age wine in bottles - they were aged in barrels. Which is where those 'oak' notes come from."]}
