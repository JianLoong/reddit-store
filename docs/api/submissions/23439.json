NTA.\n\nHe embarrassed himself, you \"exposing\" him was just basic honesty to prevent a charlatan from being a charlatan.  Sounds like you have a moral compass but he doesn't.  You did the right thing.", "So he raised you to lie to his mother instead of being honest with her? \n\nHe's got no moral high ground, here. He shouldn't be a liar and try to turn his daughter into one.\n\nNTA.", "NTA according to your father\u2019s logic he raised you to lie to your grandmother for his gain, BUT not snitch on him for his deception. \n\nYour dad was trying to steal your graduation present.", "NTA. Call me biased, I just think as far as electric cars go, teslas are garbage cars for the price. You're much better off with a toyota, cheap to maintain. That said, there is a tax write off if you buy an electric car (this could be statewide and not federal so don't quote me on that) so you would save on gas and help your grandma write a little bit off for the purchase. Good on you for snitching, what a lousy move by your dad.", ">he didn\u2019t raise me so I could expose and embarrass him.\n\nWhat kind of parent puts a child in a situation where the child is forced to expose his attempted fraud against his own mother?!?
