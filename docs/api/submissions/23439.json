Call me biased, I just think as far as electric cars go, teslas are garbage cars for the price. You're much better off with a toyota, cheap to maintain. That said, there is a tax write off if you buy an electric car (this could be statewide and not federal so don't quote me on that) so you would save on gas and help your grandma write a little bit off for the purchase.

Every time I see a Tesla, I wonder how many of the people involved in making it were subjected to harassment and abuse re: their gender, sexual orientation, race, etc., because the stories of what his companies' employees have to tolerate are pretty appalling.\n\nIncidentally, I was just reading an article the other day about the dangers cars present to pedestrians, and why pedestrian deaths in the US are so much worse, and increasing, compared to just about every other country where they have been decreasing for decades. One of the things mentioned was that EVs are more dangerous to pedestrians because their batteries weigh so much that EVs wind up being heavier than standard gas-powered cars. I also find it slightly alarming that, when EVs catch fire after an accident, they can *keep* catching fire for days afterward \u2013 when Richard Hammond crashed an electric Rimac and it caught fire, it kept catching fire for *five days;* the first battery cell caught fire, which caused the next one to catch fire, then the next one, then the next one...
