Call me biased, I just think as far as electric cars go, teslas are garbage cars for the price. You're much better off with a toyota, cheap to maintain. That said, there is a tax write off if you buy an electric car (this could be statewide and not federal so don't quote me on that) so you would save on gas and help your grandma write a little bit off for the purchase.

This was just meant to be a gift from your grandma to you as a congradulations. Your dad stuck his nose in and its his fault if he gets it bitten off", "NTA.  Your dad sounds like a female dog.  You're better off getting the car and moving out.  I'd bet he'd even try to sell it to get the Tesla.", "NTA.  Your grandma promised you a car, not your dad.

NTA!!    NTA!!!  \nBut your father sure is an AH!!", "I quite agree that OP is NTA, and her dad is one. \n\nPersonally, I also wouldn't want to support Elon Musk. Every time I see a Tesla, I wonder how many of the people involved in making it were subjected to harassment and abuse re: their gender, sexual orientation, race, etc., because the stories of what his companies' employees have to tolerate are pretty appalling.\n\nIncidentally, I was just reading an article the other day about the dangers cars present to pedestrians, and why pedestrian deaths in the US are so much worse, and increasing, compared to just about every other country where they have been decreasing for decades. One of the things mentioned was that EVs are more dangerous to pedestrians because their batteries weigh so much that EVs wind up being heavier than standard gas-powered cars. I also find it slightly alarming that, when EVs catch fire after an accident, they can *keep* catching fire for days afterward \u2013 when Richard Hammond crashed an electric Rimac and it caught fire, it kept catching fire for *five days;* the first battery cell caught fire, which caused the next one to catch fire, then the next one, then the next one... These things aren't exclusive to Teslas, obviously; I just find them interesting.", "welp. I guess we have to start choosing whether our cars are on fire, or the arctic", "NTA.\n\n\"*So, Dad.

Of course your father is angry.  He doesn't get his toy.\n\nIdeally, he should have raised you to tell the truth, and not not tell a lie.\n\nIf telling the truth embarrassed him, then it was his fault for wanting you to tell a lie.\n\nNTA", "Apparently he raised you to be bullied and manipulated, and now he is crying because it didnt take\n\nNTA", "NTA. He was trying to screw over you and your Grandma. Your Grandma offered *you* a car.", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m confused. Your dad was planning on stealing your car? Or having you sign the car over to him but not tell your grandmother? Or having you pay the insurance on the car he drives?", "NTA. Poor grandma. I wonder what it must've been like being OP's dad's mom. This kinda behaviour doesn't just randomly happen.

Atleast you know the sad truth about your dad, but given as you said \"I'm scared he would..\", means your already sadly aware of the kind of person he is.  \n\n\nEdit: OP, was he planning on buying you a Toyota, or expecting you to do without, or planning to buy a cheap used car?", "***he didn\u2019t raise me so I could expose and embarrass him***\n\nNTA.  He needed to be 'exposed and embarrassed.'  BIG TIME.", "NTA your dad is VERY sketchy. He wants to lie to his mom, he can do that without you.

They are all over glorified toys for well to do people. The current battery tech is absolutely horrible for the environment, and a grossly inefficient usage of resources.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, from what I've seen of Tesla e-vehicles, the interior design creeps me out. OP would be better off with a good Toyota hybrid. Had a Toyota Camry hybrid and the gas mileage was awesome and it lasted for over 300k miles. The newer ones are even more awesome in terms of miles per gallon.", "Yep. Have fun driving your Toyota for 300k or more if you change the oil once in a while.", "I mainly suggested them for the tax write off but you're right on all counts. don't forget they love to freeze in even mild winter weather, lmao", "Was he raising you as a liar then? nta", "NTA, you stopped him from taking advantage of your grandma.

I mean, that would be the logical conclusion, right?", "You forgot stealing from his own child. NTA op", "NTA\n\nTrying to hijack a gift intended for you is a scummy thing to do.  Trying to squeeze more money out of grandma is a scummy thing to do.  I don't know what your father is thinking, but the actions you describe seem pretty shitty.", "NTA. Your grandma promised YOU a car. Not him.", "Your dad:  Wants his child to lie to grandma, and dupe her into buying him a very expensive car.\n\nYou:  Tells grandma, afraid that otherwise Dad will go behind back and cheat grandma, thereby saving grandma from being duped.\n\nI'm pretty clear that the A here is your dad, and that you're NTA.  In fact, you're a very honest person and if you dad were also honest, he'd be proud of your integrity.", "Yeah, where was the promise to replace the car. Grandma wants OP to be mobile and is willing to buy a new car so her grandson has a safe and reliable mode of transport. All dad wants is a shiny new toy, he should man up and ask his mummy for himself and not play sneaky buggers"]}
