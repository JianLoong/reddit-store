My husband and his ex had a bad breakup, since she was also in a relationship with someone else and thought that my stepdaughter was his. She broke things off with my husband. He and I were already in a relationship when he had to take a paternity test and found out he was her father. Her mom also has a problem with me, because she thought that my husband would get back together with her.  \n\n\n  \nEx has 3 other kids with her partner. When she was pregnant with her 3rd one. My stepdaughter came to live with us because there was no room for her at her mom\u2019s house. At the time we had a lot going on, just bought a home and were in the middle of renovations. We stayed in the house, to save money. It wasn\u2019t a livable situation for a 4-year-old but decided to take her in anyway. We went through tough times with her during these 3 years and everything just became stable. Our home is finished and financially we are doing very well.   \n\n\n  \nI'm currently five months pregnant, and though it wasn't a planned pregnancy, my husband and I are happy about it. However, my stepdaughter is not very excited about a new sibling. She even asked my mom if we would send her away now that we were having a baby. Someone at her school told her that she might be sent away because we wouldn't care about her with a new baby in the house, and she's worried that everything will change again.  \n\n\n  \nMy husband and I decided to throw a big birthday party for her to make her feel special. Everything has already been planned and paid for by my in-laws and parents. Her birthday is on the 22nd and her party is on the 25th. She had her weekend with her mom and usually, she gets dropped off at my in-law\u2019s home, so I\u2019m never in contact with the ex. This Sunday ex dropped her off at our home and yelled at me about the party. She said a bunch of horrible things about my family and that she would send people to disrupt the party if my family was there.  \n\n\n  \nMy stepdaughter asked if her party would be canceled because that\u2019s what her mother said. I told her honestly that we might have to cancel it because we want to make sure it is safe and fun for everyone. I told her we would still celebrate her birthday, no matter what. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow my husband is a bit upset that I told her. I just wanted to be honest with her in case we did have to cancel the party due to her mom\u2019s threats. her mom has done this before and I just didn\u2019t want her to feel disappointed again. I of course didn't mean to upset her, I just think it's awful to lie to her and then we do end up having to cancel or the party does end up being disrupted. Idk. He told me he understood, but was still upset. My stepdaughter is still very distraught. I just didn't want her to feel disappointed.

This little girl has abandonment issues, I can recognize them from my own childhood. Cancelling her party may be a warranted consequence, but please think of the long term emotional and relationship damage this can do. She needs reassurance that you, like her other mom, are not sending her away because you replacing her with your own new baby. This could become a huge issue that comes back throughout her life if handled wrong.", "If you're concerned about safety, call the police.\n\nDo not cancel the party.  Doing so will be a huge disappointment to stepdaughter and a victory for her mother.\n\nYTA", "Soft YTA. Your stepdaughter is feeling insecure about her place in your life. She's already been sent away by one parent who didn't have room for her after starting a new family, she saw you guys struggling to make it work with her only to be having another baby as soon as it does start working. Of course, she believes her classmate that she's going to be sent away. Her mom wants to create a rift, and that's why she threatened the good time you're trying to show her daughter. From the child's fragile perspective, canceling the party would just be proof that she's a burden. \n\nMove the location of the party so the mom doesn't know where it is. Let the mom know that to keep things peaceful, you think it's best if she celebrates separately from you and your husband.", "YTA Your stepdaughter is seven years old,  insecure about her future with your family, and you tell her you might cancel her birthday party because of some random rant by her unhinged mother. All you had to do was reassure her you'd celebrate her birthday and the grown ups will figure it out.", "YTA, if you cancel the party you\u2019re basically confirming her fears in her mind.", "Can your hubby get full custody?  It sounds like the ex is unstable. \n\nOf course ask step daughter first.", "Soft YTA. Typically I'd agree that honesty is the best policy but this child is 7. She has seen some major upheavals in her life and made to feel left out, unwanted, and put to the side.\n\nHer mother is definitely TA, but you need to be more cognizant that she doesn't need unfiltered truth all the time. Perhaps it would have been better to tell her that her mother is trying to cause trouble but you're committed to celebrating her birthday and you'll figure this out together as a family. Try to be more comforting. This poor girl just wants to be loved and feel special on her birthday, surely you can empathize with that.", "YTA.... she is seven years old. Her life seems so sad- her own mother didn't even want her (it is lame excuse to not have \"room\") and it seems like she is still so worried that she is going to be abandoned. She deserves this party. Have it anyway, tell the mom to fuck off and you will call the police if anybody shows up and makes a scene. Stop living life around her- set boundaries and adhere to them. I also think that was not the way to tell her IF the party really has to be cancelled.. if the mom is seriously a danger though, call the police. Get a restraining order.", "YTA\n\n'I just wanted to be honest with her'....\n\nThe fuck is wrong with you. She's a severely traumatized seven-year-old and you doubled down on that trauma with your 'honesty'. Your job as a step-parent, and your husband's job as the bio parent is to ensure this poor baby has a stable, safe feeling, loving environment; NOT one in which you're 'being honest with her' by letting her know that her own mother can still hurt her, even at a distance.", "yta\n\nyou are proving to stepdaughter that she is not a priority \n\nclearly her mum is emotionally abusing her , why have you not looked into full custody \n\nat this point the ex has threatened you that should be enough for you to take legal action", "YTA. You're validating her fears. Can you move the party? Put someone on bouncer duty?", "Yta 'I'm not sure honey, I need to talk with your daddy' is just as honest.  She's *7*, you and her dad need to *protect* her.", "YTA.\n\nI feel so bad for that kid. She already went through so much and you're going to cancel her birthday party because her mother made some \"threats\". \n\nGo to the cops. Hire some fucking security and let that poor child have her fucking birthday party for God's Sakes.", "YTA because you didn\u2019t handle this well.\n\nYou\u2019re right that your stepdaughter deserves the truth. Where you made a mistake was on focusing on the wrong truth.\n\n\u201cStepdaughter, no matter what we are going to have your birthday party. It may look a bit different than we originally planned but nothing will stop us from celebrating you and making sure you feel as loved as you are, because you are so loved.\u201d", "You didn't have to lie to her you could have just said \"we'll figure it out\" and then you know figure it out. She's 7 and people close to her are telling her her party will be cancelled and she will be sent away when the new baby comes (which she must already have trauma from when she was sent away from moms when there was no room for her because of a new baby) so of course she's distraught when you told her that this might be happening. YTA yes. You did not handle this well.", "You do know if she shows up call the police. Or splurge a bit to hire security to assist. The party should carry on. At least you weren\u2019t trying to punish the birthday girl. Her mom is threatening to ruin things. So kinda the a hole. As in caving into one person over many. Might even let the police know ahead there might be trouble and why. Maybe a patrol car might be allowed to drive around at times to see if all is okay. And if she makes good on the threats could be the last time she gets to see her daughter.", "YTA so you hire security and make sure they can get through the front door, you don't cancel a birthday party and then have a conversation with a child and blame the other parent no matter how disgusting they are.", "I don't know where you stand with respect to getting full custody of your step daughter. However, her sending away the child when she had other kids and now threats to disrupt the party will make great ammunition in a custody battle. \n\nHave the party. Keep security on standby (it could even be trusted parents and friends). If bio mom tries to disrupt the party, get your lawyer involved and get a restraining order against her. No judge will allow a parent who violently sabotages a child's birthday party to be involved in the child's life.\n\nThis might even go a long way in resolving the insecurities your step daughter has vis a vis her life. She would see you as the parent who would go the extra length for her happiness and bio mom as a threat.", "The girl was bred out of her own home. She deserves a party.", "YTA. Surely if you\u2019re holding it at your home you have the ability to check the door before answering, in the event that her mother does turn up - so you just don\u2019t let her or anyone with her in? And likewise if you\u2019re out in your garden, surely have a lockable gate and only allow access through the main front door? \n\nEdit: and if it\u2019s a public venue, is it not possible to give a list of names / invitees to the staff in order to avoid anyone arriving who isn\u2019t invited? \n\nYou\u2019ve gone for the nuclear option with this poor girl, in a really misguided attempt to be honest with her. She already sounds like she\u2019s unsettled thanks to things her classmates have been putting in her head about the new baby, so yours and your partners job is to make her world as secure as possible, not throw up other potential stressors for her to be upset over even more.", "YES, YTA. All of the adults in this narrative SUCK. I implore you and your husband to get into parenting classes ASAP and get the daughter into therapy yesterday.", "Yta for even telling her anything about it before discussing it with your husband. And if you seriously scared by the threats you can either change the venue, call the cops cancelling should have been a last resort", "YTA.\n\n\"We noticed my step-daughter has abandonment issues because she's worried about having to leave when the baby is born, so we decided to throw a party to fix everything. \n\nNow we probably won't have the party for safety reasons, but let me explain that to a seven year old as if they would understand the issue and not equate no party = no love\"", "YTA- She's going through a lot of stuff for a 7 year old. She just got forced out of her mom's home because they couldn't take her on with the 3 new kids. You're pregnant and she's scared that it's gonna happen, because it's already happened to her. You promised a party and already have it paid for. \n\nThis child has no mother essentially, except you, because her own mom is a piece of work who'd rather focus on the new children. You need to be the mother this girl needs. And that includes throwing the party you promised.\n\nIf her mom is threatening and acting this way, get security or cops involved so the party can be thrown. Also you and your husband need to get full custody. I don't think courts will look too kindly on the ex for abandoning her daughter, because she chose her newer kids. Add in the threats and custody should be somewhat easier.\n\nDo the party!", "YTA. give me a break. this kid has already gone through enough shit as a 7 year old. she's dealing with fears or potential abandonment again with you being pregnant, and now you are telling her she won't get a party because that's apparently the only way you know how to deal with her mother's threats? please. if it's that much of a concern then hire security. this girl has dealt with more than enough of the adult bullshit as it is.", "Yta. She's 7 and been through a lot already.  I understand wanting to be honest, but she's not an adult with full understanding.  Nobody would fault you for lying to a 7 year old to make them feel validation & love.  I'd suggest taking this as a learning moment for future parenting.", "YTA So why couldn\u2019t you just change the venue, or hire bouncers or something? Why cancel it outright? The only person you\u2019re hurting is your stepdaughter when you do that and you\u2019re feeding right into her biomom\u2019s plan. And to be honest I think if you do have to break bad news to her you should have first communicated with your husband about it.", "Yta for not being able to perspective shift before Opening your Mouth.\n\nYou didn't need to entertain the notion of the party being cancelled or jump on board without talking with your hubby.\n\nStop. Examine why the hell you did that?", "ESH- this is all adult conversations you shouldn\u2019t be including the child. \u2018Being honest\u2019 with a 7 year old is hurtful because she hasnt the adult shield yet to deal with kind of conflicts.", "YTA canceling a 7yr olds party because adults can\u2019t or won\u2019t act like adults.  Don\u2019t want to disappoint the stepdaughter?  What do you think you did when you told her the party is cancelled?  The child probably told her mom about the party because she was excited and crazy mom probably talked about all kinds of hateful things including how to ruin the party the entire time she had the child.  When crazy mom dropped the child at OP\u2019s home instead of the in-laws she should\u2019ve known there would be a problem.  OP should let DH handle the ex.  Right now both mom\u2019s are a disappointment to this child.  A 7 yr old doesn\u2019t need honesty when OP\u2019S spine is a piece of string.  If your going to interact with the ex then you need to advocate for the poor kid and not le the crazy woman win.  The ex got what she wanted, the kid is disappointed and it OP\u2019s fault.  Another bonus for the ex is no matter what what happens now the besides having a party won\u2019t matter because that child will remember the party as cancelled.  How much you want to bet the ex will foot with the kid around how she doesn\u2019t matter because if she did then they wouldn\u2019t hav canceled.  Poor kid too much of her childhood is being ripped away by uncaring adults.  How will she be treated when the baby arrives thats another issue that the ex is probably filling her head with.  Now she has to worry about being sent away because you have your own baby and she\u2019s nothing to OP.  Have that party and be an adult and call the police also report her threats.", "Unfortunately this thread has a lot of bitter BMs and the second you said you were a step mom they were going to judge you negatively. I suggest looking at the threat r/stepparents if you want more helpful advice. I\u2019m going with NTA because you were honest and your intentions were pure AND you told her you were still going to celebrate her birthday no matter what. It seems a-lot of people are intentionally skipping that part. I suggest getting security for the party if possible as well as created a group chat with all the adults coming to inform them of the situation and threats.  Tell SD you and her dad will do all you can to throw her the best party ever.", "YTA. SO MUCH. \n\nYou fucked up so badly here. Instead of reassuring your stepdaughter that she will still have her birthday party, the message she\u2019s gotten instead is \u201cI\u2019m not worth a party. Mommy said bad things to Stepmom and Stepmom says Mommy is bad and Mommy is my mommy so I am bad, too.\u201d\n\nThis is core memory formation time for a child. She will never, ever forget this. Even if you push the party through, this is a moment she will never forget. You need to get her into therapy to help her come to terms with the changes happening in her life. You need to form a stronger, more cohesive, bond with your stepdaughter so she never doubts your love for her. You need to readjust your Honesty Gauge (TM) to take into consideration the relationship you have with the person AND their ages instead of hiding behind \u201cI was just being honest!\u201d because that automatically makes you an asshole. \n\nStorytime: I have a JustNo mother. My entire childhood she\u2019d dangle really fun things to try getting me to behave to get this thing as my reward only to make it so punitive that just breathing wrong or looking at her wrong would result in Fun Thing being taken away from me. I remember every single one of those occasions and how each one made me feel unworthy, unloved, and unvalued, and I am nearly 40 now. Result: I haven\u2019t spoken to the woman in over 8 years. Why? She told me on multiple occasions how much she resented me and hated me for being born when I was\u2026like I had any choice in the matter of my conception. Also result: I\u2019ve been in intensive therapy for over a decade to try unpacking and fixing all the wounds and toxic thinking that woman issued me. \n\nDon\u2019t make your stepdaughter responsible for the actions of her mother. It\u2019s an accident of biology and DNA, nothing else.", "YTA. \n\nShe's a 7yo girl going through a great deal of stress, uncertainty and upheaval. \n\nIt is your job to keep her safe, and indeed to feel safe. She needs to know she can rely on you as a safe adult. It is your job to ensure that her mum doesn't make her feel unsafe. \n\nYou need to keep your promises to this little girl, or she will stop trusting grown ups.", "YOu were well intentioned, but 100% YTA.  This kid has already been discarded once because her parent started a new family.  Now she is terrified you are going to do it again, and you break a promise to her.  It doesn't matter the reasons, it doesn't matter whose fault it is, but you move heaven and earth to make sure that that little girl gets her birthday party and that she is the center of the universe.  If you have to hire the local chapter of the Hell's Angels as security to keep her mother and her family out, you do what you need to do, but the little girl is already terrified.  You do not break a promise to her.", "YTA why are you letting this woman control you and your family?

She even asked my mom if we would send her away now that we were having a baby. Someone at her school told her that she might be sent away because we wouldn't care about her with a new baby in the house, and she's worried that everything will change again.\n\nThis child is scared of being abandoned a second time and needs reassurance from both you and her father that you will not let that happen again. This party is obviously a big deal for her, and you agreeing with her mother about possibly cancelling it will have her contemplating what else will happen.", "Rather than the blatant honesty to a seven year old, you could\u2019ve/should\u2019ve said I hope not. Then she knows you don\u2019t want to and if it does have to be cancelled, she wouldn\u2019t think it was your fault. \n\nHowever there are options that have been suggested to you, simply MOVE the location. My suggestion would be to your parents house, if they\u2019d allow it.", "NTA. Could you have said it a better way? Of course! But you didn\u2019t tell her out of malice. Nothing has been canceled yet, and it doesn\u2019t need to be. If you think there\u2019s any ounce of truth to the threats made, call the police or hire security for the party. There are solutions around exes threats and you don\u2019t have to disappoint your stepdaughter just because her bio mom is insane.", "YTA. That 4 year old is walking on the razors edge of a total break down. She needs support, she needs to be lifted. You might not think it was a big deal but that child thinks shes disposable enough. You dont cancel the party, you call the cops if something gets disrupted.", "Soft YTA \n\nEither your step daughter probably feels abandoned by her mother since she already thinks you\u2019re gonna send her away.

Like how are you not calling to police? Also \"send some peopl\" who  TF is she going to find to disrupt  a kids Birthday party? Skeletor?

I feel for you knowing you are stuck in the middle of a situation you haven't created or added to. Your SD has probably been lied to since birth so lying to her again about her narcissistic mothers behaviour isn't going to make anything better either but withholding certain truths wont do no harm. You shouldn't cancel the party though, don't let a self centred AH dictate to you and your family what you can and can't do. Show your SD the support you already have by throwing her this party and including her in the plans for your newborn (Congrats by the way). Parenting your own is difficult enough.

She doesn't need to be stressed out by what's going on between the adults.  I say this as a former foster parent who had to deal with unbelievable sh!t with the biological family.

She definitely sounds like she has some abandonment issues, which is understandable considering *everything.* Family therapy might be better than just one-on-one, since it would help you navigate how best to handle her issues.", "You do the party as planned and you hire some people to keep ex and her family out.

That may include not allowing her on the property, and also hiring security to remove her if she tries anything, and the police if she causes a problem.

There are plenty of options, but the important thing is to keep a calm and stable environment for your stepdaughter.", "I completely understand wanting to be transparent with your stepdaughter. Could you have handled it better? Yes. Do these things happen when you're stuck between a rock and a hard place? Absolutely. \n\nYou are NOT the AH for anything. BUT I think given all the things this little girl has been through you and your husband need to sit with her and talk everything through about the party, her safety being important to you both, and how she is still a part of your family with or without a new baby. She needs to know that you are never going to abandon her. \n\nIn terms of what other people have said, think about the options you have to make the party happen in a safe way,  and have this discussion with your husband. He is probably hurting badly, too, given the situation, and I know how horrible it feels from the step-mum side of it. You need to help each other out or it just gets worse.\n\nBottom line: Speak to and involve your stepdaughter (but remember as awful as her mother is, she is still her mother), lean on each other when it gets harder, and remember to think carefully before you speak. \n\nWe all make mistakes, and I guarantee you every parent or stepparent on here has put their foot in it at some point.

My husband and his ex had a bad breakup, since she was also in a relationship with someone else and thought that my stepdaughter was his. She broke things off with my husband. He and I were already in a relationship when he had to take a paternity test and found out he was her father. Her mom also has a problem with me, because she thought that my husband would get back together with her.  \n\n\n  \nEx has 3 other kids with her partner. When she was pregnant with her 3rd one. My stepdaughter came to live with us because there was no room for her at her mom\u2019s house. At the time we had a lot going on, just bought a home and were in the middle of renovations. We stayed in the house, to save money. It wasn\u2019t a livable situation for a 4-year-old but decided to take her in anyway. We went through tough times with her during these 3 years and everything just became stable. Our home is finished and financially we are doing very well.   \n\n\n  \nI'm currently five months pregnant, and though it wasn't a planned pregnancy, my husband and I are happy about it. However, my stepdaughter is not very excited about a new sibling. She even asked my mom if we would send her away now that we were having a baby. Someone at her school told her that she might be sent away because we wouldn't care about her with a new baby in the house, and she's worried that everything will change again.  \n\n\n  \nMy husband and I decided to throw a big birthday party for her to make her feel special. Everything has already been planned and paid for by my in-laws and parents. Her birthday is on the 22nd and her party is on the 25th. She had her weekend with her mom and usually, she gets dropped off at my in-law\u2019s home, so I\u2019m never in contact with the ex. This Sunday ex dropped her off at our home and yelled at me about the party. She said a bunch of horrible things about my family and that she would send people to disrupt the party if my family was there.  \n\n\n  \nMy stepdaughter asked if her party would be canceled because that\u2019s what her mother said. I told her honestly that we might have to cancel it because we want to make sure it is safe and fun for everyone. I told her we would still celebrate her birthday, no matter what. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow my husband is a bit upset that I told her. I just wanted to be honest with her in case we did have to cancel the party due to her mom\u2019s threats. her mom has done this before and I just didn\u2019t want her to feel disappointed again. I of course didn't mean to upset her, I just think it's awful to lie to her and then we do end up having to cancel or the party does end up being disrupted. Idk. He told me he understood, but was still upset. My stepdaughter is still very distraught. I just didn't want her to feel disappointed.

Nice.", "Honesty is not always the best policy. Take it from someone who left an abusive ex husband and has shared custody of a 7yr old. She always asks why I don\u2019t love her daddy anymore, I take the hit with a \u201csometimes people realize they love each other as friends, and that\u2019s ok\u201d. Never in a MILLION YEARS will I ever tell her that her dad covered the spectrum on abuse and I was lucky to get out. He treats her amazing and she was too young to remember most of it. It\u2019s our jobs as parents to protect them, even if it\u2019s by not telling the truth. I know when my daughter is older she will be able to put the pieces together and then we can have the conversation. \n\nAs a soon to be mum and a step mum, it\u2019s your job to protect these kids. You should have told her the party is still on, and the adults will figure it out. She\u2019s worried you are about to throw her away like her bio mother. You should be working twice as hard to make her feel essential to your family - include her in decorating baby\u2019s room, shopping for clothes, and ask if she also wants to paint her room/get a new comforter to celebrate being a big sister again. If you don\u2019t\u2026 well you\u2019re likely to have a jealous and sad little girl that doesn\u2019t understand why the baby gets 90% of your attention. \n\nAlso, when the baby is here have her help you choose an outfit for the day, and give her little tasks so she can feel included and help her bond with the baby. My daughter struggled with this the most when my husband and I had a baby 18 months ago. We bought her big sister shirts, decorated, asked for her help on picking clothes/stuffies etc for the baby boy. She even got to help pick what I decorated his cake for his 1st birthday! That first year is hard enough with just a baby and it\u2019s really easy for other kids to feel left out, even without the trauma this little girl already has. \n\nTalk to her dad about seeing a child therapist as well.

This means framing the party as a surprise for your stepdaughter, because you never want to put the burden on the stepdaughter to protect herself from her mom. If there are relatives who have a history of oversharing with the mom, then they don't get to know the details of the party. It's pretty straightforward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This Sunday ex dropped her off at our home and yelled at me about the party. She said a bunch of horrible things about my family and that she would send people to disrupt the party if my family was there.\n\nWhy did you listen to this? In this situation, you usher the stepdaughter inside immediately and call the police if the mom insists on standing on your property yelling threats. You don't engage. You don't even tell her you're calling the police: You just do it. It's baffling to me that your stepdaughter has lived with you for three years, yet you seem to have no idea how to handle her mom. \n\nYour poor stepdaughter has dealt with a lot of insecurity and abandonment in her short life. Your job, as a functional parent, is to shield her from as much of it as you can. As so many others have pointed out, there are several ways to prevent the mother from disrupting the party without canceling the party. Refusing to engage with any of those and instead just telling her it might have to be cancelled -- ESPECIALLY when you say it's happened before so you should have been prepared for this -- under the guise of \"just being honest\" is cruel. It's important to be honest with kids, but it's also important to plan ahead to protect them and consider alternatives.

For most of us, that's the bare minimum for being a mediocre human being, not something that deserves a gold star.", "Very soft YTA  While it is good to be honest, sometimes we are too honest to children, and make things worse. She's 7 years old, and your answer made her more anxious and have more to worry about. It would have been better to simply reassure her that you would celebrate no matter what, without more details. You didn't do it to be malicious, but it wasn't the best handling. But also far from the worst way. I hope she gets to have her birthday!\n\nMight be a good idea to look into security for the party.", "YTA. I would literally never say something like this to my stepson. You find ways to make stuff happen as a parent and like several people have said you reassure her that things will be okay, despite the fact there may be a chance of a big party not happening.", "YTA. A very big smelly one.\nWhat was your real motive by saying this? The child sounds like it is experiencing trauma and you are now adding to it. As much as you are trying to avoid the mother and drama it also sounds like you are also avoiding the child\u2019s emotions. You should take some consideration for others feelings. You sound like a very fake person. Have some empathy.", "YTA \nOP has no say in whether the party goes on or is canceled!  It is your in-laws family and her father putting on the party.  She overstepped her boundary as a stepparent and added more stress in this poor girl's life!", "I'm saying NTAH. You're still saying you'll celebrate the party and are just thinking of everyone's safety. Though I do prefer the idea of moving the party to a different location and hiring the police or security. I saw someone else mention having them help shop for the baby, which is a great idea! Having her be involved and letting her know that her opinions are important to you is crucial right now. So, NTAH, but could've handled it differently. Keep letting her know she's not a burden.", "NTA but wrong in many Cases", "YTA .It doesn't feel like you should need to be reminded that this is a 7 YEAR OLD CHILD. Look at the questions she's asking! This child is petrified - there is SO MUCH anxiety about being sent away, not being wanted, being unloved because of the new baby and all the changes. It was so nice to plan a big party to make her feel special, but honestly why aren't you just having serious talks with her about how this is her home, that you and her dad will never \"send her away,\" and that she will be loved even more with a new baby sibling and not be forgotten. Reassurance is what this child is screaming for.  You should be reconfirming these things for her every day. Who knows what she's hearing at home with her mom in addition to school? She needs to hear from you and her dad, all the time, that she has an important place in this family. That the baby needs a big sister. That you need her to be a good big sister.\n\nThe issue with the ex is an adult issue. The mother said some awful things in front of her own child and it's clear that this made the child worry AGAIN, that something would be taken away. The party would be cancelled.. and Instead of reassuring her about her fears, you made them worse. All you needed to say was, \"I won't let anything ruin your party, don't worry.\" This child does not need \"honesty\" from an adult at 7 years old. She's showing you what she wants and needs - REASSURANCE. Just show her that you always have her back. Worrying about the party was something you should have kept to yourself, as it's an adult concern. And you shouldn't let the mother's threats ruin the party you promised her.", "She\u2019s 7. Jfc.

Hope you're not this terrible at parenting your own child.", "Your stepdaughter will need a lot of reassurance that she's not expendable and not going to be forced out of her home when the new baby comes along. She has experienced those things already so she knows they can happen. I think your heart is in the right place and the party is a great idea. Knowing her mother is dangerous, it makes sense to try to avoid her disrupting the party. Canceling it though - is there another way? to keep the promise to the child while also protecting her and the rest of you from the malevolent mother/ex? Maybe move the party to another location that she doesn't know about. or change the date without telling anyone who would tell her. \n\nI wish she would leave you all alone. That little girl needs some dependable adults in her life, and you and your husband are giving that to her. Good parenting!", "YTA.

That little one has been through hell and back and the least you could of done was tell her yes and simply change the location of where the party was supposed to take place and, maybe, keep the location from the bio mom.

All these people calling OP the AH for not \"simply\" hiring security or being prepared to call the police... I wonder if they'd finance the first? And we don't know a thing about the police in their area. What we do know due to OP's comments is that the girl's mother is a racist and stereotyping OP's family as being criminals.\n\nOP was put into a really bad place and had to make a decision on how to handle this. Was it the best way? No - but that's easy to say in hindsight.", "Yep. That's right. That's what police is for. Can you make a prior complaint coz of the threat and have the police pass by to check on you'll on the day of the party? I don't know if that's possible where you are but worth a try. Also, let the mother know you are filing a police complaint against her. \n\nThe kid doesn't have to go through this. What must she be going through with all this in her head at such a young age. Her own mother sent her away coz she dint have place for her with her new kids. Now she is confused about her place in your house and you are considering canceling the one thing you were doing to make a her feel better. Common... kid needs more love. \n\nAlso, I get you told her the truth coz you don't want her to be disappointed but seriously.. her mom threatened to ruin the party and your conclusion was to straight cancel it? This kid needs to be protected from a mother like that. Someone needs to stand up for her and do right by her.

ESH.", "Hire security.  If any disruption happens, let them take care of it. \n\nDo not cancel the party.", "I agree with the above. Don't cancel the party. And please get SD involved with planning for the baby. Shopping for clothes, helping to plan for the shower, ask her how the baby's room should be decorated. Also, maybe redecorate her room a little ( new comforter, etc). Letting her help plan will make her feel much more involved. And tell her no matter what anyone else says, she is going to stay with you and & her Dad.\n\nAlso, that kid saying that to her is a little bit of bullying. If it happens again, you should tell her teacher.", "I think this is fair. In all honesty when I saw the post title I was assuming this would be another situation where the stepkid in question did something the OP didn't like leading to the OP canceling the event out of spite or to \"teach the kid a lesson.\" That's not what happened here, though. Sounds like there's some legitimate concern that the ex may cause issues based on her track record. I agree with the soft YTA because OP shouldn't have told the kid they may have to cancel the party, but I chalk it up more to inexperience. I know she's had a role in the kid's life for a long time but she's a stepparent so I wonder if she feels like she doesn't have any say in what happens with the child, that it's all up to the bio parents.", "This. While it is understandable, what OP did, a seven-year-old is too young to understand that complexity, and the reason why her party may have to be rescheduled. It would still hurts and older child, but they may at least have been able to understand. It is such a shitty situation for that poor seven year old.", "This. There was really no need to put further strain, stress and anxiety on an already over anxious and fearful child. I feel so incredibly sorry for this child with a mother so unhinged that she would be so petty to go and ruin her own child's birthday party just because OP's family would be there and is helping put it on. Like, as a parent myself I can't fathom any situation in which I would want to harm my child in such a way. \n\nOP, as the adults in this situation it is on you and your husband to ensure the stress, anxiety and strain of dealing with this unhinged woman is on YOU, not the child. The child should not have to be putting up with this but unfortunately since her mother has weekend visits she does...but at the least you can ensure your home is safe to her and that she knows she is safe there. \n\nFigure out how to fix the problem without putting the problem on the child.", "My husband is already in the process and was advised to document as much as possible.", "This!!!", "I agree. Additionally, I don't think it's good for OP to reinforce ANY of the shitty things bio mom says (directly or indirectly). I know at that age, OP'S response would have me scared that everything my bio mom says might be true. This child was looking for comfort and reassurance in the face of emotional abuse and OP didn't supply.\n\nIt seems like OP and husband have been kinda viewing this kid as a burden from the day they took her in.

Hire security since you\u2019re doing so well financially, tell the ex under no uncertain terms anyone coming to disrupt will be removed and if they refuse to leave will be arrested for trespassing, and start thinking like a problem solving adult with a child\u2019s best interest in mind", "Wow...

Way to make an already scary and threatening situation with your step daughter worse. While yes you should be honest with kids, there is a way to do so age appropriately. Also, she did not need honesty right in that moment. You needed to wait and speak with her father to see how to proceed. Secondly, I hope your husband made a police report about the threats. It needs to be documented and it needs to be reported to the courts. Ex is making threats, traumatizing her daughter further, and interfering with the parenting and running of the household. None of those things are okay. Husband might want to get the custody agreement modified. Please have husband get his daughter into therapy.

Have the party, keep the police number handy.", "I can see why. Your husband is still probably very angry with you for falling into his ex's trap, and doesn't trust you right now. Because that's exactly what happened. His ex knew that if she made a scene and threats,  you'd not only want to cancel it, you'd tell your vulnerable stepdaughter it's not happening. Which she can later use to make you the bad guy in her eyes. Your husband knew that. That why he wasn't going to say anything. You however fell for it. Congrats.

OP is pregnant now, 3 years later, with an unplanned pregnancy, so clearly she was planning a new baby and new life with her husband from the beginning?

She sent over a bunch of people that come in there, making a fuss and breaking things how traumatized with a child be at that point?

You can hire off duty law enforcement to come to the party. Give them a list of everyone that\u2019s invited and no one else comes in unless the parents say ok.

Op can gather evidence through ring or other cameras and file for a no contact or restraining order on the footage if she can catch her, which doesn\u2019t sound like it would be hard tbh", "OP said they were stable. Stable does not equal well off. In addition, for those that are harping about this: telling SD that cancelling is a possibility is less traumatic than cancelling it out of the blue. Yes, OP and bio Dad should do everything in their power to make sure that doesn't happen, but the reality is cancelling is still a possibility. And risking injury and harm to SD and others is not worth that risk. Now, I would suggest, if possible, you change where the birthday is being held at and only let those invited know.

I think I'd rather have my Mom and her friends make asses out of themselves than have to hide the fact that people love me and want to celebrate my birthday.

I\u2019m well aware of the holes, but consistent and multiple reports with no resolution will get officers in trouble. Also, even if nothing is resolved with the child, they can subpoena every officer involved as a witness and use the reports to get a no contact or restraining order even if just for op, making their home a place mom cannot go without risking jail time and third party contact is not allowed depending on the state. It sucks, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s perfect, but have the reports as back up for future use. Also, trespassing and threatening, if mom shows up, would at least force them to remove her and then file a report on the incident which could help op and father in custody court. Police did nothing when I was raped and I understand the holes in the system, but you can\u2019t give up on a child because mom is a verbally abusive racist. What kind of example does that set for the daughter? She may be physically safe, but she\u2019s not actually safe at all. Caving to moms antics only harms the daughter.", "It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t get that, but this is a time to gather evidence to prove this is happening. You can always file a report even if they choose to act. My mom works with police as a labor lawyer. They do get reprimanded if they have multiple reports and consistently do nothing. Even if you get the report of what happened and witness statements, you can bring it to custody court or file a no contact order which would ban mom from op\u2019s home making it a safe place.

Does this not make sense? If she\u2019s dangerous, evidence only supports their claim for custody. Maybe even a no contact order for op only could make a huge difference.", "Exactly. If someone comes to disturb the party, the police can get involved. Until then, there is no crime.", "People on Reddit think the cops are concierges they can call to deal with inconveniences.", "It depends on the situation, but tell them you\u2019d like a report filed. Police will be reprimanded for failure to investigate. Either way, punishing the child here isn\u2019t right. If mom shows up threatening, it\u2019s trespassing at least. If you can catch her on camera pulling shit, it can be brought up in custody court. Parental alienation is taken seriously, depending on the state. If mom is such a concern, putting up cameras would help a lot. Keeping every communication via text or email. Get a ring doorbell and refuse to let her in. What is mom going to do if she shows up but the door is locked? Break in with a whole family of witnesses? Seems like the perfect time to gather the family in defense. Prep the police and say you\u2019ve received threats for an event on this day and you fear for your life. Calls are recorded. Even if they don\u2019t post a patrol car, there\u2019s proof to intent and planning if she does pull shit. I\u2019m not claiming it\u2019s perfect, you have to fight, but I feel it is more than worth it to stop mom. If you cave now, during dads parenting time, you\u2019re enabling her control over her daughter when she isn\u2019t the primary caregiver and in someone else\u2019s home. This behavior can and probably will escalate which is unsafe for everyone including the new baby. How will this affect the new babe if mom is still doing this during hand offs? How will this affect the stepdaughter if this behavior just continues as is? It\u2019s not just about the safety of the stepdaughter, but dad\u2019s rights and op\u2019s safety and that of their unborn child.", "It is fully ludicrous to me that these are your suggestions.\n\n1. OP may live in a 2-party consent state. There are in fact laws about recording someone without their consent. \n\n2. It is bananas to think that *a child's birthday party* is worth buying and provisioning cameras. A missed party is perfectly survivable. \n\n3. \"Evidence\" is great. Evidence that you get by exposing a child to a potentially violent altercation between her biological mother and attendees of her birthday party is absolutely not worth it. What you're suggesting here is tantamount to using a *child* as bait. \n\n4. It's fully possible that the party is held at a location that *can* be set up in such a way that OP's mom and whichever people she chooses to bring for backup can be prevented from coming into contact with the party while it's in session. We don't have that information, so saying it's easy or achievable is not really based in reality.\n\n5. Being honest within reason with children is extremely important, both from a respect standpoint and so that they have sufficient information to protect themselves. This kid was present when her mother made these threats. She knows about them. Yes, sometimes when a person with a history of unstable behavior is specifically promising more unstable behavior, you have to take potentially unpleasant and unfair steps to take yourself out of harm's way. OP probably could've been more strategic about it, but a kid who witnessed threats asking if threats were going to be taken seriously deserves a generally honest answer.", "Yes, exactly. Definitely file a report, you want allllllll this nonsense documented when the next custody hearing rolls around. I just meant, don\u2019t expect the police to show up to prevent unspecified mischief, unless you\u2019re in a really small town or something."]}
