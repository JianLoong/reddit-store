My husband and his ex had a bad breakup, since she was also in a relationship with someone else and thought that my stepdaughter was his. She broke things off with my husband. He and I were already in a relationship when he had to take a paternity test and found out he was her father. Her mom also has a problem with me, because she thought that my husband would get back together with her.  \n\n\n  \nEx has 3 other kids with her partner. When she was pregnant with her 3rd one. My stepdaughter came to live with us because there was no room for her at her mom\u2019s house. At the time we had a lot going on, just bought a home and were in the middle of renovations. We stayed in the house, to save money. It wasn\u2019t a livable situation for a 4-year-old but decided to take her in anyway. We went through tough times with her during these 3 years and everything just became stable. Our home is finished and financially we are doing very well.   \n\n\n  \nI'm currently five months pregnant, and though it wasn't a planned pregnancy, my husband and I are happy about it. However, my stepdaughter is not very excited about a new sibling. She even asked my mom if we would send her away now that we were having a baby. Someone at her school told her that she might be sent away because we wouldn't care about her with a new baby in the house, and she's worried that everything will change again.  \n\n\n  \nMy husband and I decided to throw a big birthday party for her to make her feel special. Everything has already been planned and paid for by my in-laws and parents. Her birthday is on the 22nd and her party is on the 25th. She had her weekend with her mom and usually, she gets dropped off at my in-law\u2019s home, so I\u2019m never in contact with the ex. This Sunday ex dropped her off at our home and yelled at me about the party. She said a bunch of horrible things about my family and that she would send people to disrupt the party if my family was there.  \n\n\n  \nMy stepdaughter asked if her party would be canceled because that\u2019s what her mother said. I told her honestly that we might have to cancel it because we want to make sure it is safe and fun for everyone. I told her we would still celebrate her birthday, no matter what. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow my husband is a bit upset that I told her. I just wanted to be honest with her in case we did have to cancel the party due to her mom\u2019s threats. her mom has done this before and I just didn\u2019t want her to feel disappointed again. I of course didn't mean to upset her, I just think it's awful to lie to her and then we do end up having to cancel or the party does end up being disrupted. Idk. He told me he understood, but was still upset. My stepdaughter is still very distraught. I just didn't want her to feel disappointed.

This little girl has abandonment issues, I can recognize them from my own childhood. Cancelling her party may be a warranted consequence, but please think of the long term emotional and relationship damage this can do. She needs reassurance that you, like her other mom, are not sending her away because you replacing her with your own new baby.

She's already been sent away by one parent who didn't have room for her after starting a new family, she saw you guys struggling to make it work with her only to be having another baby as soon as it does start working. Of course, she believes her classmate that she's going to be sent away. Her mom wants to create a rift, and that's why she threatened the good time you're trying to show her daughter. From the child's fragile perspective, canceling the party would just be proof that she's a burden. \n\nMove the location of the party so the mom doesn't know where it is. Let the mom know that to keep things peaceful, you think it's best if she celebrates separately from you and your husband.", "YTA Your stepdaughter is seven years old,  insecure about her future with your family, and you tell her you might cancel her birthday party because of some random rant by her unhinged mother. All you had to do was reassure her you'd celebrate her birthday and the grown ups will figure it out.", "YTA, if you cancel the party you\u2019re basically confirming her fears in her mind.", "Can your hubby get full custody?  It sounds like the ex is unstable. \n\nOf course ask step daughter first.", "Soft YTA. Typically I'd agree that honesty is the best policy but this child is 7. She has seen some major upheavals in her life and made to feel left out, unwanted, and put to the side.\n\nHer mother is definitely TA, but you need to be more cognizant that she doesn't need unfiltered truth all the time. Perhaps it would have been better to tell her that her mother is trying to cause trouble but you're committed to celebrating her birthday and you'll figure this out together as a family. Try to be more comforting. This poor girl just wants to be loved and feel special on her birthday, surely you can empathize with that.", "YTA.... she is seven years old. Her life seems so sad- her own mother didn't even want her (it is lame excuse to not have \"room\") and it seems like she is still so worried that she is going to be abandoned. She deserves this party. Have it anyway, tell the mom to fuck off and you will call the police if anybody shows up and makes a scene. Stop living life around her- set boundaries and adhere to them. I also think that was not the way to tell her IF the party really has to be cancelled.. if the mom is seriously a danger though, call the police. Get a restraining order.", "[removed]", "yta\n\nyou are proving to stepdaughter that she is not a priority \n\nclearly her mum is emotionally abusing her , why have you not looked into full custody \n\nat this point the ex has threatened you that should be enough for you to take legal action", "YTA. You're validating her fears. Can you move the party? Put someone on bouncer duty?", "Yta 'I'm not sure honey, I need to talk with your daddy' is just as honest.  She's *7*, you and her dad need to *protect* her.", "YTA.\n\nI feel so bad for that kid. She already went through so much and you're going to cancel her birthday party because her mother made some \"threats\". \n\nGo to the cops. Hire some fucking security and let that poor child have her fucking birthday party for God's Sakes.", "YTA because you didn\u2019t handle this well.\n\nYou\u2019re right that your stepdaughter deserves the truth. Where you made a mistake was on focusing on the wrong truth.\n\n\u201cStepdaughter, no matter what we are going to have your birthday party.

She's 7 and people close to her are telling her her party will be cancelled and she will be sent away when the new baby comes (which she must already have trauma from when she was sent away from moms when there was no room for her because of a new baby) so of course she's distraught when you told her that this might be happening. YTA yes. You did not handle this well.", "You do know if she shows up call the police. Or splurge a bit to hire security to assist. The party should carry on. At least you weren\u2019t trying to punish the birthday girl. Her mom is threatening to ruin things. So kinda the a hole. As in caving into one person over many. Might even let the police know ahead there might be trouble and why. Maybe a patrol car might be allowed to drive around at times to see if all is okay. And if she makes good on the threats could be the last time she gets to see her daughter.", "YTA so you hire security and make sure they can get through the front door, you don't cancel a birthday party and then have a conversation with a child and blame the other parent no matter how disgusting they are.", "I don't know where you stand with respect to getting full custody of your step daughter. However, her sending away the child when she had other kids and now threats to disrupt the party will make great ammunition in a custody battle. \n\nHave the party. Keep security on standby (it could even be trusted parents and friends). If bio mom tries to disrupt the party, get your lawyer involved and get a restraining order against her. No judge will allow a parent who violently sabotages a child's birthday party to be involved in the child's life.\n\nThis might even go a long way in resolving the insecurities your step daughter has vis a vis her life. She would see you as the parent who would go the extra length for her happiness and bio mom as a threat.", "The girl was bred out of her own home. She deserves a party.", "YTA. Surely if you\u2019re holding it at your home you have the ability to check the door before answering, in the event that her mother does turn up - so you just don\u2019t let her or anyone with her in? And likewise if you\u2019re out in your garden, surely have a lockable gate and only allow access through the main front door? \n\nEdit: and if it\u2019s a public venue, is it not possible to give a list of names / invitees to the staff in order to avoid anyone arriving who isn\u2019t invited? \n\nYou\u2019ve gone for the nuclear option with this poor girl, in a really misguided attempt to be honest with her. She already sounds like she\u2019s unsettled thanks to things her classmates have been putting in her head about the new baby, so yours and your partners job is to make her world as secure as possible, not throw up other potential stressors for her to be upset over even more.", "YES, YTA. All of the adults in this narrative SUCK. I implore you and your husband to get into parenting classes ASAP and get the daughter into therapy yesterday.", "Yta for even telling her anything about it before discussing it with your husband. And if you seriously scared by the threats you can either change the venue, call the cops cancelling should have been a last resort", "YTA.\n\n\"We noticed my step-daughter has abandonment issues because she's worried about having to leave when the baby is born, so we decided to throw a party to fix everything. \n\nNow we probably won't have the party for safety reasons, but let me explain that to a seven year old as if they would understand the issue and not equate no party = no love\"", "YTA- She's going through a lot of stuff for a 7 year old. She just got forced out of her mom's home because they couldn't take her on with the 3 new kids. You're pregnant and she's scared that it's gonna happen, because it's already happened to her. You promised a party and already have it paid for. \n\nThis child has no mother essentially, except you, because her own mom is a piece of work who'd rather focus on the new children. You need to be the mother this girl needs. And that includes throwing the party you promised.\n\nIf her mom is threatening and acting this way, get security or cops involved so the party can be thrown. Also you and your husband need to get full custody. I don't think courts will look too kindly on the ex for abandoning her daughter, because she chose her newer kids. Add in the threats and custody should be somewhat easier.\n\nDo the party!", "YTA. give me a break. this kid has already gone through enough shit as a 7 year old. she's dealing with fears or potential abandonment again with you being pregnant, and now you are telling her she won't get a party because that's apparently the only way you know how to deal with her mother's threats? please. if it's that much of a concern then hire security. this girl has dealt with more than enough of the adult bullshit as it is.", "Yta. She's 7 and been through a lot already.  I understand wanting to be honest, but she's not an adult with full understanding.  Nobody would fault you for lying to a 7 year old to make them feel validation & love.  I'd suggest taking this as a learning moment for future parenting.", "YTA So why couldn\u2019t you just change the venue, or hire bouncers or something? Why cancel it outright? The only person you\u2019re hurting is your stepdaughter when you do that and you\u2019re feeding right into her biomom\u2019s plan. And to be honest I think if you do have to break bad news to her you should have first communicated with your husband about it.", "Yta for not being able to perspective shift before Opening your Mouth.\n\nYou didn't need to entertain the notion of the party being cancelled or jump on board without talking with your hubby.\n\nStop. Examine why the hell you did that?", "ESH- this is all adult conversations you shouldn\u2019t be including the child. \u2018Being honest\u2019 with a 7 year old is hurtful because she hasnt the adult shield yet to deal with kind of conflicts.", "YTA canceling a 7yr olds party because adults can\u2019t or won\u2019t act like adults.  Don\u2019t want to disappoint the stepdaughter?  What do you think you did when you told her the party is cancelled?  The child probably told her mom about the party because she was excited and crazy mom probably talked about all kinds of hateful things including how to ruin the party the entire time she had the child.  When crazy mom dropped the child at OP\u2019s home instead of the in-laws she should\u2019ve known there would be a problem.  OP should let DH handle the ex.  Right now both mom\u2019s are a disappointment to this child.  A 7 yr old doesn\u2019t need honesty when OP\u2019S spine is a piece of string.  If your going to interact with the ex then you need to advocate for the poor kid and not le the crazy woman win.  The ex got what she wanted, the kid is disappointed and it OP\u2019s fault.  Another bonus for the ex is no matter what what happens now the besides having a party won\u2019t matter because that child will remember the party as cancelled.  How much you want to bet the ex will foot with the kid around how she doesn\u2019t matter because if she did then they wouldn\u2019t hav canceled.  Poor kid too much of her childhood is being ripped away by uncaring adults.  How will she be treated when the baby arrives thats another issue that the ex is probably filling her head with.  Now she has to worry about being sent away because you have your own baby and she\u2019s nothing to OP.  Have that party and be an adult and call the police also report her threats.", "Unfortunately this thread has a lot of bitter BMs and the second you said you were a step mom they were going to judge you negatively. I suggest looking at the threat r/stepparents if you want more helpful advice. I\u2019m going with NTA because you were honest and your intentions were pure AND you told her you were still going to celebrate her birthday no matter what. It seems a-lot of people are intentionally skipping that part. I suggest getting security for the party if possible as well as created a group chat with all the adults coming to inform them of the situation and threats.  Tell SD you and her dad will do all you can to throw her the best party ever.", "YTA. SO MUCH. \n\nYou fucked up so badly here. Instead of reassuring your stepdaughter that she will still have her birthday party, the message she\u2019s gotten instead is \u201cI\u2019m not worth a party. Mommy said bad things to Stepmom and Stepmom says Mommy is bad and Mommy is my mommy so I am bad, too.\u201d\n\nThis is core memory formation time for a child. She will never, ever forget this. Even if you push the party through, this is a moment she will never forget. You need to get her into therapy to help her come to terms with the changes happening in her life. You need to form a stronger, more cohesive, bond with your stepdaughter so she never doubts your love for her. You need to readjust your Honesty Gauge (TM) to take into consideration the relationship you have with the person AND their ages instead of hiding behind \u201cI was just being honest!\u201d because that automatically makes you an asshole. \n\nStorytime: I have a JustNo mother. My entire childhood she\u2019d dangle really fun things to try getting me to behave to get this thing as my reward only to make it so punitive that just breathing wrong or looking at her wrong would result in Fun Thing being taken away from me. I remember every single one of those occasions and how each one made me feel unworthy, unloved, and unvalued, and I am nearly 40 now. Result: I haven\u2019t spoken to the woman in over 8 years. Why? She told me on multiple occasions how much she resented me and hated me for being born when I was\u2026like I had any choice in the matter of my conception. Also result: I\u2019ve been in intensive therapy for over a decade to try unpacking and fixing all the wounds and toxic thinking that woman issued me. \n\nDon\u2019t make your stepdaughter responsible for the actions of her mother. It\u2019s an accident of biology and DNA, nothing else.\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks for reporting my comment for suicide, stranger. You overstepped. I said no such thing, nor did I imply I was suicidal. You need to stop. \n\nReplies to the below people: You\u2019re reading too much into my own story share. I shared it out of concern that OP may be leaning too far into punitive measures of punishment that have nothing to do with the daughter\u2019s behavior. I shared mine as a demonstration of how this kind of \u201cdiscipline\u201d can cause harm to a child. \n\nAlso, for those who are like \u201cnOt AlL cHiLdReN\u201d\u2026 Obviously not. Everyone responds differently to situations and circumstances. THIS child is already being repeatedly traumatized. THIS child is already showing worrying signs of excessive fears (replacement, abandonment, etc.) and THIS child needs to be handled with extra care.\n\nThat is the point of my storytime.", "YTA. \n\nShe's a 7yo girl going through a great deal of stress, uncertainty and upheaval. \n\nIt is your job to keep her safe, and indeed to feel safe. She needs to know she can rely on you as a safe adult. It is your job to ensure that her mum doesn't make her feel unsafe. \n\nYou need to keep your promises to this little girl, or she will stop trusting grown ups.", "YOu were well intentioned, but 100% YTA.  This kid has already been discarded once because her parent started a new family.  Now she is terrified you are going to do it again, and you break a promise to her.  It doesn't matter the reasons, it doesn't matter whose fault it is, but you move heaven and earth to make sure that that little girl gets her birthday party and that she is the center of the universe.  If you have to hire the local chapter of the Hell's Angels as security to keep her mother and her family out, you do what you need to do, but the little girl is already terrified.  You do not break a promise to her.", "YTA why are you letting this woman control you and your family?

She even asked my mom if we would send her away now that we were having a baby. Someone at her school told her that she might be sent away because we wouldn't care about her with a new baby in the house, and she's worried that everything will change again.\n\nThis child is scared of being abandoned a second time and needs reassurance from both you and her father that you will not let that happen again. This party is obviously a big deal for her, and you agreeing with her mother about possibly cancelling it will have her contemplating what else will happen.", "Rather than the blatant honesty to a seven year old, you could\u2019ve/should\u2019ve said I hope not. Then she knows you don\u2019t want to and if it does have to be cancelled, she wouldn\u2019t think it was your fault. \n\nHowever there are options that have been suggested to you, simply MOVE the location. My suggestion would be to your parents house, if they\u2019d allow it.", "NTA. Could you have said it a better way? Of course! But you didn\u2019t tell her out of malice. Nothing has been canceled yet, and it doesn\u2019t need to be. If you think there\u2019s any ounce of truth to the threats made, call the police or hire security for the party. There are solutions around exes threats and you don\u2019t have to disappoint your stepdaughter just because her bio mom is insane.", "YTA. That 4 year old is walking on the razors edge of a total break down. She needs support, she needs to be lifted. You might not think it was a big deal but that child thinks shes disposable enough. You dont cancel the party, you call the cops if something gets disrupted.", "Soft YTA \n\nEither your step daughter probably feels abandoned by her mother since she already thinks you\u2019re gonna send her away.

Your SD has probably been lied to since birth so lying to her again about her narcissistic mothers behaviour isn't going to make anything better either but withholding certain truths wont do no harm. You shouldn't cancel the party though, don't let a self centred AH dictate to you and your family what you can and can't do. Show your SD the support you already have by throwing her this party and including her in the plans for your newborn (Congrats by the way). Parenting your own is difficult enough.

It's your job as the adult to keep worrisome derails like the mama drama away from the kids.  She didn't need to know about that.  You could have quickly moved the event somewhere else and made sure the guests were informed or hired security if you think the mom is really that psycho.  Your stepdaughter deserves to be a child!  She doesn't need to be stressed out by what's going on between the adults.  I say this as a former foster parent who had to deal with unbelievable sh!t with the biological family.

She definitely sounds like she has some abandonment issues, which is understandable considering *everything.* Family therapy might be better than just one-on-one, since it would help you navigate how best to handle her issues.", "You do the party as planned and you hire some people to keep ex and her family out.

That may include not allowing her on the property, and also hiring security to remove her if she tries anything, and the police if she causes a problem.

There are plenty of options, but the important thing is to keep a calm and stable environment for your stepdaughter.", "I completely understand wanting to be transparent with your stepdaughter. Could you have handled it better? Yes. Do these things happen when you're stuck between a rock and a hard place? Absolutely. \n\nYou are NOT the AH for anything.

She needs to know that you are never going to abandon her. \n\nIn terms of what other people have said, think about the options you have to make the party happen in a safe way,  and have this discussion with your husband. He is probably hurting badly, too, given the situation, and I know how horrible it feels from the step-mum side of it. You need to help each other out or it just gets worse.\n\nBottom line: Speak to and involve your stepdaughter (but remember as awful as her mother is, she is still her mother), lean on each other when it gets harder, and remember to think carefully before you speak. \n\nWe all make mistakes, and I guarantee you every parent or stepparent on here has put their foot in it at some point.

My husband and his ex had a bad breakup, since she was also in a relationship with someone else and thought that my stepdaughter was his. She broke things off with my husband. He and I were already in a relationship when he had to take a paternity test and found out he was her father. Her mom also has a problem with me, because she thought that my husband would get back together with her.  \n\n\n  \nEx has 3 other kids with her partner. When she was pregnant with her 3rd one. My stepdaughter came to live with us because there was no room for her at her mom\u2019s house. At the time we had a lot going on, just bought a home and were in the middle of renovations. We stayed in the house, to save money. It wasn\u2019t a livable situation for a 4-year-old but decided to take her in anyway. We went through tough times with her during these 3 years and everything just became stable. Our home is finished and financially we are doing very well.   \n\n\n  \nI'm currently five months pregnant, and though it wasn't a planned pregnancy, my husband and I are happy about it. However, my stepdaughter is not very excited about a new sibling. She even asked my mom if we would send her away now that we were having a baby. Someone at her school told her that she might be sent away because we wouldn't care about her with a new baby in the house, and she's worried that everything will change again.  \n\n\n  \nMy husband and I decided to throw a big birthday party for her to make her feel special. Everything has already been planned and paid for by my in-laws and parents. Her birthday is on the 22nd and her party is on the 25th. She had her weekend with her mom and usually, she gets dropped off at my in-law\u2019s home, so I\u2019m never in contact with the ex. This Sunday ex dropped her off at our home and yelled at me about the party. She said a bunch of horrible things about my family and that she would send people to disrupt the party if my family was there.  \n\n\n  \nMy stepdaughter asked if her party would be canceled because that\u2019s what her mother said. I told her honestly that we might have to cancel it because we want to make sure it is safe and fun for everyone. I told her we would still celebrate her birthday, no matter what. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow my husband is a bit upset that I told her. I just wanted to be honest with her in case we did have to cancel the party due to her mom\u2019s threats. her mom has done this before and I just didn\u2019t want her to feel disappointed again. I of course didn't mean to upset her, I just think it's awful to lie to her and then we do end up having to cancel or the party does end up being disrupted. Idk. He told me he understood, but was still upset. My stepdaughter is still very distraught. I just didn't want her to feel disappointed.

You should be working twice as hard to make her feel essential to your family - include her in decorating baby\u2019s room, shopping for clothes, and ask if she also wants to paint her room/get a new comforter to celebrate being a big sister again.

My daughter struggled with this the most when my husband and I had a baby 18 months ago. We bought her big sister shirts, decorated, asked for her help on picking clothes/stuffies etc for the baby boy. She even got to help pick what I decorated his cake for his 1st birthday! That first year is hard enough with just a baby and it\u2019s really easy for other kids to feel left out, even without the trauma this little girl already has. \n\nTalk to her dad about seeing a child therapist as well.

She said a bunch of horrible things about my family and that she would send people to disrupt the party if my family was there.\n\nWhy did you listen to this? In this situation, you usher the stepdaughter inside immediately and call the police if the mom insists on standing on your property yelling threats. You don't engage. You don't even tell her you're calling the police: You just do it. It's baffling to me that your stepdaughter has lived with you for three years, yet you seem to have no idea how to handle her mom. \n\nYour poor stepdaughter has dealt with a lot of insecurity and abandonment in her short life. Your job, as a functional parent, is to shield her from as much of it as you can. As so many others have pointed out, there are several ways to prevent the mother from disrupting the party without canceling the party. Refusing to engage with any of those and instead just telling her it might have to be cancelled -- ESPECIALLY when you say it's happened before so you should have been prepared for this -- under the guise of \"just being honest\" is cruel. It's important to be honest with kids, but it's also important to plan ahead to protect them and consider alternatives. YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> My stepdaughter came to live with us because there was no room for her at her mom\u2019s house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It wasn\u2019t a livable situation for a 4-year-old but decided to take her in anyway\n\nAlso, YTA for the above. You don't get extra credit in life for not rejecting your 4-year-old stepdaughter who has nowhere else to go. For most of us, that's the bare minimum for being a mediocre human being, not something that deserves a gold star.", "Very soft YTA  While it is good to be honest, sometimes we are too honest to children, and make things worse. She's 7 years old, and your answer made her more anxious and have more to worry about. It would have been better to simply reassure her that you would celebrate no matter what, without more details. You didn't do it to be malicious, but it wasn't the best handling. But also far from the worst way. I hope she gets to have her birthday!\n\nMight be a good idea to look into security for the party.", "YTA. I would literally never say something like this to my stepson. You find ways to make stuff happen as a parent and like several people have said you reassure her that things will be okay, despite the fact there may be a chance of a big party not happening.", "YTA. A very big smelly one.\nWhat was your real motive by saying this? The child sounds like it is experiencing trauma and you are now adding to it. As much as you are trying to avoid the mother and drama it also sounds like you are also avoiding the child\u2019s emotions. You should take some consideration for others feelings. You sound like a very fake person. Have some empathy.", "YTA \nOP has no say in whether the party goes on or is canceled!  It is your in-laws family and her father putting on the party.  She overstepped her boundary as a stepparent and added more stress in this poor girl's life!", "I'm saying NTAH. You're still saying you'll celebrate the party and are just thinking of everyone's safety. Though I do prefer the idea of moving the party to a different location and hiring the police or security. I saw someone else mention having them help shop for the baby, which is a great idea! Having her be involved and letting her know that her opinions are important to you is crucial right now. So, NTAH, but could've handled it differently. Keep letting her know she's not a burden.", "NTA but wrong in many Cases", "YTA .It doesn't feel like you should need to be reminded that this is a 7 YEAR OLD CHILD. Look at the questions she's asking! This child is petrified - there is SO MUCH anxiety about being sent away, not being wanted, being unloved because of the new baby and all the changes. It was so nice to plan a big party to make her feel special, but honestly why aren't you just having serious talks with her about how this is her home, that you and her dad will never \"send her away,\" and that she will be loved even more with a new baby sibling and not be forgotten. Reassurance is what this child is screaming for.  You should be reconfirming these things for her every day. Who knows what she's hearing at home with her mom in addition to school? She needs to hear from you and her dad, all the time, that she has an important place in this family. That the baby needs a big sister. That you need her to be a good big sister.\n\nThe issue with the ex is an adult issue. The mother said some awful things in front of her own child and it's clear that this made the child worry AGAIN, that something would be taken away. The party would be cancelled.. and Instead of reassuring her about her fears, you made them worse. All you needed to say was, \"I won't let anything ruin your party, don't worry.\" This child does not need \"honesty\" from an adult at 7 years old. She's showing you what she wants and needs - REASSURANCE. Just show her that you always have her back. Worrying about the party was something you should have kept to yourself, as it's an adult concern. And you shouldn't let the mother's threats ruin the party you promised her.", "She\u2019s 7. Jfc. This poor kid has been through so much and you\u2019re threatening to take away a party because the adults in her life can\u2019t get their sh*t together. This poor baby.", "Yta", "Definitely the asshole. Hope you're not this terrible at parenting your own child.", "Your stepdaughter will need a lot of reassurance that she's not expendable and not going to be forced out of her home when the new baby comes along. She has experienced those things already so she knows they can happen. I think your heart is in the right place and the party is a great idea. Knowing her mother is dangerous, it makes sense to try to avoid her disrupting the party. Canceling it though - is there another way? to keep the promise to the child while also protecting her and the rest of you from the malevolent mother/ex? Maybe move the party to another location that she doesn't know about. or change the date without telling anyone who would tell her.\n\nThe child is probably very scared of her mother and feeling like she has a lot of power. So the more you and your husband can show her that the mother isn't in charge, the better. The child will feel more secure if the mother isn't seen by the family as a threat, only as a nuisance. You can make that a reality. You can do this. \n\nI wish she would leave you all alone. That little girl needs some dependable adults in her life, and you and your husband are giving that to her. Good parenting instincts.", "YTA. This poor little girl just wants stability and it be wanted yet you constantly mention how no one, including you, wants her. You should absolutely have a party for this child and stop pulling her into your adult drama.", "She is a traumatized seven year old little girl whose constantly hearing that she'll be sent away once the new baby gets there and her bio mom is trying to do everything she can to make her daughter feel even more traumatized. That little one has been through hell and back and the least you could of done was tell her yes and simply change the location of where the party was supposed to take place and, maybe, keep the location from the bio mom. I give you kudos for trying to be honest but she's already feeling like she's unwanted, you should do more to make sure she knows that she's wanted and loved.  \n\n\nSoft YTA", "Bio mom sounds like a massive piece of work. The poor girl is already traumatized thanks to her actions and now she is threatening to disrupt the party? That woman clearly does not care about her daughter in the slightest", "She said she had a problem with my family being there. She always refers to my family as criminals. She knew we were having a party, my husband told her months ago. To be honest I don't even know what the problem really is. She has always felt a certain way about me and she just keeps antagonizing us.", "The first empathetic reply I've seen here. All these people calling OP the AH for not \"simply\" hiring security or being prepared to call the police... I wonder if they'd finance the first? And we don't know a thing about the police in their area. What we do know due to OP's comments is that the girl's mother is a racist and stereotyping OP's family as being criminals.\n\nOP was put into a really bad place and had to make a decision on how to handle this. Was it the best way? No - but that's easy to say in hindsight.", "Yep. That's right. That's what police is for. Can you make a prior complaint coz of the threat and have the police pass by to check on you'll on the day of the party? I don't know if that's possible where you are but worth a try. Also, let the mother know you are filing a police complaint against her. \n\nThe kid doesn't have to go through this. What must she be going through with all this in her head at such a young age. Her own mother sent her away coz she dint have place for her with her new kids. Now she is confused about her place in your house and you are considering canceling the one thing you were doing to make a her feel better. Common... kid needs more love. \n\nAlso, I get you told her the truth coz you don't want her to be disappointed but seriously.. her mom threatened to ruin the party and your conclusion was to straight cancel it? This kid needs to be protected from a mother like that. Someone needs to stand up for her and do right by her. These incidents happening with her today are going to shape her life.", "This OP, your husband needs to also step up, she just threatened you, her own daughter and him just because she's jealous and bitter. ESH.", "Hire security.  If any disruption happens, let them take care of it. \n\nDo not cancel the party.", "I agree with the above. Don't cancel the party. And please get SD involved with planning for the baby. Shopping for clothes, helping to plan for the shower, ask her how the baby's room should be decorated. Also, maybe redecorate her room a little ( new comforter, etc). Letting her help plan will make her feel much more involved. And tell her no matter what anyone else says, she is going to stay with you and & her Dad.\n\nAlso, that kid saying that to her is a little bit of bullying. If it happens again, you should tell her teacher.", "I think this is fair. In all honesty when I saw the post title I was assuming this would be another situation where the stepkid in question did something the OP didn't like leading to the OP canceling the event out of spite or to \"teach the kid a lesson.\" That's not what happened here, though. Sounds like there's some legitimate concern that the ex may cause issues based on her track record. I agree with the soft YTA because OP shouldn't have told the kid they may have to cancel the party, but I chalk it up more to inexperience. I know she's had a role in the kid's life for a long time but she's a stepparent so I wonder if she feels like she doesn't have any say in what happens with the child, that it's all up to the bio parents.", "This. While it is understandable, what OP did, a seven-year-old is too young to understand that complexity, and the reason why her party may have to be rescheduled. It would still hurts and older child, but they may at least have been able to understand. It is such a shitty situation for that poor seven year old.", "This. There was really no need to put further strain, stress and anxiety on an already over anxious and fearful child. I feel so incredibly sorry for this child with a mother so unhinged that she would be so petty to go and ruin her own child's birthday party just because OP's family would be there and is helping put it on. Like, as a parent myself I can't fathom any situation in which I would want to harm my child in such a way. \n\nOP, as the adults in this situation it is on you and your husband to ensure the stress, anxiety and strain of dealing with this unhinged woman is on YOU, not the child. The child should not have to be putting up with this but unfortunately since her mother has weekend visits she does...but at the least you can ensure your home is safe to her and that she knows she is safe there. \n\nFigure out how to fix the problem without putting the problem on the child.", "My husband is already in the process and was advised to document as much as possible.", "This!!!", "I agree. Additionally, I don't think it's good for OP to reinforce ANY of the shitty things bio mom says (directly or indirectly). I know at that age, OP'S response would have me scared that everything my bio mom says might be true. This child was looking for comfort and reassurance in the face of emotional abuse and OP didn't supply.\n\nIt seems like OP and husband have been kinda viewing this kid as a burden from the day they took her in. Now that you're financially stable, it's time to start treating her like she's truly part of your family. Her needs have been consistently put on the backburner throughout her life; she needs comfort and consistency as a developing little human.", "Right?! Be honest with her that her mom isn\u2019t super happy with the party so you\u2019ll hire some \u201chelpers\u201d to make sure that things don\u2019t get disrupted but she\u2019s so special and deserves a big birthday party to be celebrated \n\nAnd get this kid some therapy asap!  \n\nGet it together, OP, I read that whole pointless paragraph about your Reno\u2019s and how you took her in anyways (spoiler: she\u2019s your husbands daughter so giving her a place to live is pretty much what you legally have to do, you don\u2019t deserve the credit you think you do for that), and while reading I kept thinking \u201cI must have read the title wrong, no adult with functioning brain cells and empathy would tell this child no for her birthday party after all this.\n\nAnd yet.. here we are!  Hire security since you\u2019re doing so well financially, tell the ex under no uncertain terms anyone coming to disrupt will be removed and if they refuse to leave will be arrested for trespassing, and start thinking like a problem solving adult with a child\u2019s best interest in mind", "Wow... I'd say the bio mom is the problem..  She made threats.  They need to take the kid away from her", "Making promises that may not be kept do not encourage a sense of safety.", "Honestly, just from ex's sh!t-talking and threats alone, hubby should go back to court to get full custody.     \nAnd speaking of being completely honest, hubby should at The Very Least shut down ex's sick gameplaying by saying flat out, \" this ends now or you won't even get weekends with my daughter!\".", "Which would include being honest with her. \nGood parenting sometimes means doing the hard stuff because it's what's best.", "YTA. Way to make an already scary and threatening situation with your step daughter worse. While yes you should be honest with kids, there is a way to do so age appropriately. Also, she did not need honesty right in that moment. You needed to wait and speak with her father to see how to proceed. Secondly, I hope your husband made a police report about the threats. It needs to be documented and it needs to be reported to the courts. Ex is making threats, traumatizing her daughter further, and interfering with the parenting and running of the household. None of those things are okay. Husband might want to get the custody agreement modified. Please have husband get his daughter into therapy. She is struggling because of an adult that is supposed to be protecting her. As for the other kids making cruel comments, husband needs to address this with the school, that type of behavior is also not okay.", "Was she supposed to tell her that her mother is a liar?", "I\u2019m curious to know if you\u2019re a parent?", "Lying to her then having to cancel the party would be much worse.

The party idea is very nice, but it's not going to solve things. You need to think about how you're going to make her feel included as more things begin to focus on the baby, and especially AFTER the baby is born. Can you make her feel special as a big sister? Can the two of you sit down together and decorate a special onesie for the baby, or paint something together in the baby's room, so it can be her special big sister gift?
