During the course of our 9 months my extremely social GF and I go out together several times a week and may run into anywhere from 2-10 people she knows.

This wouldn\u2019t be an issue for me personally if it didn\u2019t happen to us every single time we go out. A lot of times even when we are on a clearly defined date night we end up in these kind of situations and i would like to keep it moving and enjoy our quality time together, but it doesn\u2019t seem to ever happen where we can just enjoy our own time together without having to keep up appearances with her random friends. A lot of times it\u2019s people she doesn\u2019t even seem to be that interested in keeping a relationship with anyway and she will sometimes talk shit about some of these people we just had conversations with. Last night we got home and got into a fight because I was feeling exhausted by the fact that we can\u2019t go anywhere without this type of shit happening and I think I made her feel bad. We got into a fight and I complained to her about wanting to not have to engage in conversation with every single person she may know on a date night and that I would like to enjoy our quality time together without the extra social interaction with random people. She feels like I\u2019m trying to \u201ckeep her all to myself\u201d and that if I don\u2019t feel like engaging with those people I can simply stay home. I get that you can\u2019t control who is gonna be where but she doesn\u2019t seem to understand my perspective that quality time is supposed to be intimate and that it would be nice not to have to engage in conversation with ever single person she knows from Facebook or wherever when we go out.

Even as an extrovert salesperson it can get exhausting for me with her stopping to chat with half the town. \n\nThat being said, your girlfriend isn't doing anything wrong. She is being polite to people she knows. Over the years my wife has gotten better at offering a polite greeting but quickly disengaging from most conversations in a tactful way. It sounds like your girlfriend simply needs to learn how to shorten those interactions to a place where she is still being polite while maintaining respect for your time with her.", "INFO: what would you like her to do differently in these situations? Be specific.", "INFO... Have you ever had a calm conversation about this with her or did you just wait until you were in your feels and then pick a fight with her?", "NTA. But you two need to communicate better. You need to explain that there are times you want to go out have an intimate one-on-one date. You can\u2019t control her running into people she knows but maybe she can learn to say, \u201chey, it\u2019s great to see you, this is my bf and we\u2019re on a date so excuse me for not staying and chatting\u201d. There may be some people she feels more obligated to chat with for a short while but especially those she has less of a connection with, this might be a compromise. \n\nAlso assure her that you\u2019re not trying to keep her to yourself or isolate her. Maybe when you set out discuss whether this is a \u201chey I\u2019m on a date\u201d or a we\u2019re just cruising, let\u2019s be social outing.", "INFO: where are you having these dates? Intimate dinner dates vs going out for a drink at the bar date changes it a bit. Where are you going out? The latter is definitely be more socially appropriate for her friends to be striking up long convos with her when they bump into her so maybe her friends aren\u2019t aware that you guys are on a proper date and she maybe has trouble ending conversations with people out of feeling anxious to do so. (it can be hard!) \n\nFair that it\u2019s annoying/frustrating for you to constantly be dealing with but also not your gf fault for running into people she knows. I think a compromise here would be to maybe plan some more dates a little further out of town to avoid running into people so much. Tbh overall -  NAH", "I recently got off a two hour flight and heard to women who'd met on the flight shout 'i love you! ' to each other as they left. \nSome people make friends really easily and can talk for hours about very little. I find it annoying and I can see why you would too.", "INFO: Have you had a calm discussion with her about this, without getting raised emotions involved? Also, have you tried planning a more private and intimate date, like maybe a picnic or cooking a romantic dinner, etc?", "NAH, unless you guys can\u2019t compromise over time. It sounds like she JUST learned this is a button for you, after spending a long time thinking it was okay. Have a calm conversation with her outlining exactly what you feel and proposing compromises. Make it clear that you love that she has a wide social circle and you would never take that away, and that your real issues with this are very narrow and specific. And go easy on her for a while. It may take a while for her to get used to a new way of doing things.\n\nIf she can\u2019t or won\u2019t change, you might have to chalk it up to a fundamental personality difference and move on.", "ESH. Or maybe NAH. I guess it depends on how truly attentive each of you are to the other's needs and how much each of you care about making sure the other has their needs met.\n\nIf your GF knows a lot of people and/or if you live in a small town where running into familiar people is unavoidable, you can't expect to go out and not have these encounters. You also can't expect her to simply ignore them because that's going to lead to hurt feelings all the way around -- her friends are gonna feel pushed away, and she's going to feel trapped and isolated if she feels like she can't talk to people she knows while you're around. Your GF sounds like she has major extrovert energy, and people like that need social interaction to maintain their energy.\n\nHowever, asking her to limit the time she spends chatting other people up when the two of you are meant to be spending quality / intimate time together is not an unreasonable ask, especially if you have outings that the two of you explicitly designate as a \"date night.\" Surely her friends can understand the concept of \"oh hey, nice to see you, how are you doing, I'm on a date right now so I can't stay and chat but we can catch up over the phone / on FB afterward!\" But it also sounds like maybe she doesn't understand your own introverted energy and how important it is to you to have that quality time with her where you don't feel like an afterthought. Some people need that full attention to be reassured that they matter.\n\nThis could be a communication issue, or it could be a compatibility issue. If the two of you can find a compromise (\"social\" outings vs. \"date night\" outings comes to mind), then that's gonna help matters. But if both of you are too focused on just \"this is what I need\" then this isn't gonna work out at all.", "NTA\n\nShe can't help running into people but she could tell them she's busy, on a date, and she'll catch up lately. Of course you want to keep her to yourself during a date. But, TBH, I don't think your gf is going to change.", "NTA.

I am not. It is exhausting. \n\nYou don't have to participate in the chit chat. Even better to excuse yourself and physically walk away.", "Nah. My best friend is like this, and it drives me up a wall. We don\u2019t see each other often because we live in different states. Usually, I drive to see her because she doesn\u2019t drive. When we go out to a restaurant, she will engage in 10-15 min conversations with neighbors, acquaintances, and sometimes even homeless people she has never met before. To me, it comes across as if she is putting on a show to demonstrate how popular she is. And I feel like it\u2019s disrespectful of my time. I make the 1hr commute to see her, and she spends her time talking to strangers!\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I live in a town as well. And I\u2019m friends with my neighbors, people across town. But if I am hanging out with a friend or on a date, and we run across an acquaintance - I nod, say a quick hello, maybe introduce each other, and keep it moving. So to me, this behavior is off putting and disrespectful.", "NAH. both of your views are valid. after reading some of the other comments, i think it might be a good idea to start having distinct date nights that are held places that aren't bars. like, if you're sitting at a restaurant together it's clearly time for you both to privately spend as a couple, and if she's getting up to go chat with other people that's definitely rude. but it's also kind of weird to expect her not to chat with people at a casual place like a bar or something. so, i think you need to better section off or define your \"couple\" time so that you both are aware of what the boundaries are more clearly in this kind of thing.", "NTA there are certain moments in life where doing a \"Stop and chat\" is totally inappropriate - like when you and gf are on a date", "ESH\n\nits not your gfs fault that people recognise her everywhere so you shouldnt get into a fight abt it with her\n\nur gf should know better than to just \"stop and chat\" every single time. she clearly has no respect for u", "Simple = NTA = Your girlfriend is the asshole, not you.\n\nYou are not an asshole for being annoyed that your GF and you can't go anywhere without running into 10 people she knows. You have a valid preference for having quality time with her without interruptions or distractions. \n\nYou are not trying to keep her all to yourself, you are just asking for some boundaries and respect for your date nights. \n\nYour GF is being insensitive and dismissive of your feelings and needs. She is also being hypocritical if she talks shit about some of the people she chats with.", "More info: Who started the fight, or how did it start? IF you started a fight over this, YTA. She can't control the other people who see her. It seems like you want control over her social interactions, and that is concerning. (If she were asking for advice about this, your behavior might be seen as a red flag.) This is clearly something you don't handle well, and maybe you should seek therapy if you'd like to continue your relationship with her.", "YTA But not for being annoyed, rather for bringing it up the way you did.\n\nYou snapped at her and that is entirely uncool. Also, asking her not to talk to people puts her in a very unfair situation. Instead, try having a calm conversation with her about making an effort to keep conversations shorter while you two are on your way to a preexisting plan. \n\nAlso, she might only be badtalking those people because she can sense your reluctance. She can tell you aren't having a good time, and is trying to cheer you up and get you to engage after the fact.", "YTA.  What would you have her do, ignore people?  As you said, she's social.

She's spreading her attention around so much that there is not enough left for you. \n\nI can imagine being defensive if I were in her place and my partner pointed this out to me.

I\u2019m not trying to isolate her at all. I just wish she could keep it brief because a lot of times our dates end up being so long in the tooth with these social interactions that by the time we get home we skip sexy times because she\u2019s too tired because it\u2019s so late.

For a 9 month old relationship you really shouldn\u2019t be feeling the way you are (re: your previous posts) Im afraid to say I really don\u2019t think you guys are compatible.
