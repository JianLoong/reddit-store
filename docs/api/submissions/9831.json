The staff know me and the security know me, the cashier guy likes me whenever we interact he's always smiling and asking questions.\n\nA neckwarmer I wear over my nose, a beanie that goes over my forehead so you can only see my eyes, black cargos, black sweater, jordan 3s and I havent had a haircut I wear my nike tech hoodie unzipped and throw the hoodie over my hat so it doesnt look oddly shaped. I'm also 6'2 and black so I can understand how people can find it intimidating and ill occasionally pull it down if I walk past women or people with kids just so they completely know im not a threat but most of the time I dont care, Im not going to hurt or steal, this is just how I dress its anti social but its comfortable and works for me. I'm not going to dress to fit in or to make myself seem \"less threatening\", I dont think I should change how I dress just because I happened to be born into a stereotype where people that look like me do bad spooky things.\n\nI get to the store and I walk in, neckwarmer up, security obviously recognizes me and he's watched the cameras everytime I go in, I usually buy the same thing everytime. A guy walks up to me and taps me on hand and says \"dont wear the mask respect the store\". I said \"dont touch me\" then I took my headphones off and he said it again, he also said he was the co owner which he wasnt. I said no im not taking my mask off -> not to be a dick the store is empty, all the staff know me it'd be pointless taking my mask off and im quick im not tryna spend 2 minutes shopping at night. <- Security comes and puls this guy away because he knows me and can tell the guy starting what I see as unnecessary problems. He knows I dont steal and there's no problem. After saying no the guy was basically talking shit and non sense he's really annoying me so I talk about his fake watch. I dont think he was actively trying to provoke me but this weird idea that taking my neckwarmer down will somehow change anything is stupid, \"but cameras\" no one is wasting time looking for a thief that steals \u00a310 worth of chocolate. I have no reason to steal to make that clear to redditors I know yall selectively read which is why your perspectives will be.. interesting.\n\nThe fact he touched me and then told me to do something that isnt required by law, by the store, there's 0 sign of anyone stealing and the store is basically empty annoyed me as I usually just walk in, no one causes problems and im out. Feel threatened tells security \"watch the tall black guy with the mask on\", I dont care just dont touch or talk to me lmao. \n\nSome people dress \"anti social\" and you can be cautious that's understandable but it doesn't matter. The banker wearing a suit will steal your pension while smiling in your face and you'll smile back but you're worried about a guy tryna buy some chocolate with a neckwarmer.

I just felt it was unnecessary for him to even approach me that and him touching me.. I try to understand why from his perspecitve and there's just too many alternatives for the option he chose to make sense.

As a former retail manager, I actually fucked up one time and allowed customer complaints to push me to ask a shopper to either take down their good or take off their gaiter that was fashioned around their face. It was the wrong thing for me to do then, and it's the wrong thing for them to have done to you. \nIt's no one's business what you wear. That is head to toe and includes facial coverings. Things that concern stores in regards to theft (large backpacks, out of season hoodies, etc) are the only things that should be regulated and that regulation should be posted and enforced uniformally \n\nAlso, hell no, no one should ever, ever touch you", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to take a mask off or any other article of clothing on your persons just because someone doesn\u2019t like it.  He was definitely an AH for coming up to you and touching you in the first place.\n\nEdit: spelling error", "NTA. You can wear whatever the hell you want. It\u2019s not your job to convince other people to feel at ease in your presence. I\u2019m guessing this is like a 7-11 (US)?  I go in pajamas when I want a snack - who cares? The cashier and the security guard don\u2019t.\n\nNo one gets to touch you, no one gets to materially misrepresent who they are (re he\u2019s lying about being a co-owner to manipulate you into doing what he wants? Hell no), and it\u2019s a him problem, not a you problem. Get your late night snack. And he can fuck right off.", " NTA. There\u2019s *no way* I\u2019m going up to *anyone* and telling them to take their neck warmer down. It\u2019s none of my business. And, on top of that, tapping you on the hand? Ballsy.", "\"Respect the store\"? What the hell did he mean by that? Tell that loonie you're a ninja. :)\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYou weren't doing anything wrong, breaking any laws or store rules, or causing any problems. Pretty sure your neck warmer meets the dress code for grabbing late night snacks. \n\nThe nerve of that guy to tell you to \"respect the store\" while refusing to respect your personal space. Some people just suck ass.", "NTA. Jesus people suck.", "NTA - The guy did not work there, and therefore it was not his place. If he had an issue he should have said something to an employee or just left.", "NTA\n\nThe person who came up and touched you was wrong to do so. He was also wrong to insist you to remove your face covering. Whether you made an insulting comment about his watch afterward really doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nYou\u2019re dressed comfortably and aren\u2019t wearing anything that\u2019s inappropriate for the weather or the situation. You\u2019re just going about your own business without bothering anyone. And I\u2019ve got no sympathy for somebody who\u2019s nervous because you\u2019re a Black man who decided to dress in whatever way. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to change how you dress, and it\u2019s comfortable for you, then you shouldn\u2019t have to change it. You have every right to occupy space in the world, and the asshole who decided to come and mess with your space was wrong.

I can\u2019t imagine being in your shoes and having to deal with crap like that even once, much less regularly.", "NTA. No one should be touching you, and people still wear masks all the time.
