I'm also 6'2 and black so I can understand how people can find it intimidating and ill occasionally pull it down if I walk past women or people with kids just so they completely know im not a threat but most of the time I dont care, Im not going to hurt or steal, this is just how I dress its anti social but its comfortable and works for me. I'm not going to dress to fit in or to make myself seem \"less threatening\", I dont think I should change how I dress just because I happened to be born into a stereotype where people that look like me do bad spooky things.\n\nI get to the store and I walk in, neckwarmer up, security obviously recognizes me and he's watched the cameras everytime I go in, I usually buy the same thing everytime. A guy walks up to me and taps me on hand and says \"dont wear the mask respect the store\". I said \"dont touch me\" then I took my headphones off and he said it again, he also said he was the co owner which he wasnt. I said no im not taking my mask off -> not to be a dick the store is empty, all the staff know me it'd be pointless taking my mask off and im quick im not tryna spend 2 minutes shopping at night. <- Security comes and puls this guy away because he knows me and can tell the guy starting what I see as unnecessary problems. He knows I dont steal and there's no problem. After saying no the guy was basically talking shit and non sense he's really annoying me so I talk about his fake watch. I dont think he was actively trying to provoke me but this weird idea that taking my neckwarmer down will somehow change anything is stupid, \"but cameras\" no one is wasting time looking for a thief that steals \u00a310 worth of chocolate. I have no reason to steal to make that clear to redditors I know yall selectively read which is why your perspectives will be.. interesting.\n\nThe fact he touched me and then told me to do something that isnt required by law, by the store, there's 0 sign of anyone stealing and the store is basically empty annoyed me as I usually just walk in, no one causes problems and im out. Feel threatened tells security \"watch the tall black guy with the mask on\", I dont care just dont touch or talk to me lmao. \n\nSome people dress \"anti social\" and you can be cautious that's understandable but it doesn't matter.
