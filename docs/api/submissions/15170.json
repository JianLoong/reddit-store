She has always had tantrums (and still does) when something didn\u2019t go her way or she didn\u2019t get what she wanted. Don would often just give in. His go to line is \u201cyou need to pick your battles\u201d but I never saw him picking any. He\u2019d just get Amy whatever she wanted, let her eat what she wanted, do what she wanted. No curfew or rules or chores at his house, so of course he became the preferred parent.

That has been a major win. I am pretty happy she does that, but I don\u2019t think I should pay her for it. So I\u2019ve decided to stop giving her pocket money. Don\u2019t get me wrong I pay for her school lunches, money for the bus, and phone, but I\u2019m no longer giving her extra money just for existing. \n\nDons parents give Amy $100 every 2 weeks anyway, which she spends immediately on clothes or makeup. So I think that\u2019s more than enough. But it\u2019s never enough for Amy and she\u2019s accusing me of neglect for refusing to give her an allowance.

She needs discipline from her father, not an allowance.", "NTA, she's getting a huge amount of money already and it certainly isn't neglect. She's about old enough to work, if you wanted to give her the opportunity to make money put the onus on her to show how many hours of work she is doing and what that is worth to her, then have her research local jobs and get a sense of what she can expect in a year or two with a part time job.\n\nAccountability outside you and your ex husband is probably the only hope for righting her course at this point. Have her get a part-time job or volunteer, both to get her some experience and consequences, but also to help prep her for college applications and independence down the line. 100 a week on clothes and makeup is an insane amount of wasted money. She needs to understand what it means to earn it.\n\nHer dad needs to also cut it out with the money before she hits adulthood totally unable to fend for herself.", ">She says all her friends get an allowance from both their parents and that I should give her money for doing her homework and keeping her room clean\n\n\n\nNo, she really shouldn\u2019t. There is no point arguing with a bratty 14 year old. She believes she is entitled to an allowance, she absolutely isn\u2019t, but likely won\u2019t understand that until she experiences people living more difficult lives then her own. She\u2019s going to go to her friends who will agree with her and tell her you are a terrible mean monster. The fact that she used the word neglect is telling, she has no idea about life.\n\n\nNTA and don\u2019t feel bad about it, regardless of how she will try to make you.", "NTA. Every kid tells their parents their friends all get allowances and their friends parents are better. It's just typical teenager behavior.", "NTA, your daughter is spoiled, and your ex fostered that behavior. I probably wouldn't be able to talk to him without screaming.", "Nta.. my parents never gave me an allowance and I was never bratty enough to say that it was neglect. Don has spoiled her stupid clearly and you are doing the right thing as a mother to bring her back down to earth. Now would be a good time to teach budgeting. $100 every 2 weeks on makeup and clothes at that age is ridiculous. She could be saving up so much.", "I know how frustrating it is to try to coparent with someone who won't be a team with you, and it's a constant comparison. I read in the comments that you are in therapy...have you thought of doing some together with your daughter? My daughter and I were going through a rocky time when she was at that age, and we did monthly sessions together, in addition to her weekly one on ones, and it was super helpful. Probably saved our mother/daughter relationship and helped us see each other's perspectives. It sounds like your daughter is being manipulated to choose one parent over the other, and you just can't take that laying down. You may not have any control over what happens at his house, but you do control yours. \n\nPer the actual situation at hand, I don't think any kid deserves an allowance for, as you said, just existing. School work, doing her own laundry and keeping a clean room are minimum expectations for her own personal upkeep. Who else is going to do those things? If she were doing some additional chores, that would be different. I think the purpose of an allowance, for parents who choose to do that, is to teach the value of working for something. So I'm going with NTA. I hope you and your daughter can find some middle ground.", "NTA-and to her argument, We didn\u2019t give out allowances to any of mine (nor pay them for grades or completing chores). If any of my kids needed something, we bought it. If they didn\u2019t need it, we didn\u2019t buy it.", "NTA you explained your reasons OP, now go through with it. Be the voice of reason. As she gets older, have certain conversations early. Also, just start listening. Look at other resources about how to do gentle parenting. Her room's a mess and she can't find something? Tell her that she'll find it eventually. No worries.", "NTA, but her father is.", "NTA even without the Grandparents contribution. $200 a month is a crazy amount for a 14 year old. I'm not surprised she's spoiled. Ideally you'd all be a united front, with that money being conditional upon her completing chores at both homes, but I fear you're perhaps fighting a losing battle here.", "NTA. he is. she's spoiled.", "NTA. I never had an allowance growing up. I was still expected to do chores around the house without complaint.", "NTA\nShe already gets a very generous allowance of $2400/yr. If she saved up for a few months she can buy herself almost anything a teenager could want. Going any further with the allowance would just teach her bad spending habits.", "NTA...it sounds like she has all that she needs.", "NTA.  *Good* parenting is tough, and it seems that your ex takes the easy way out, at your daughter's long-term peril. **Good for you** for thinking of her in the long term.  \n\n\nIt may be that you need a completely different tact in how to handle your daughter; in the face of the parenting vacuum created by your ex, traditional methods may fall flat.....", "NTA.  At her age, I didn\u2019t have an allowance.  I had to ask for money, or save birthday/Christmas money, or help around the house to earn it.  I probably got about $40/month for the mall or movies with friends by asking, though I usually had to give back anything I didn\u2019t spend (and my mom taught me to be pretty choosy about how I spent my money - we were house-poor for a couple chunks of my childhood, and she grew up poor due to having 10 siblings, so I knew the value of money even when I didn\u2019t have to earn it).  It\u2019s been 25 years, so that\u2019s about a third of what your daughter is getting as allowance from her grandparents.  If she\u2019s not willing to earn a second allowance, it seems silly to me that she thinks she should have one.", "NTA she will have a rude awakening ....", "\u201cMom\u2019s the boss but while you\u2019re here you can do whatever you want\u201d : coward parenting at its finest ! What an ass. \n\nYou're NTA, but your ex is a piece of work.", "I would say ESH. Get Amy individual therapy as well as family therapy for the both of you.", "NTA. My children do not get allowance for chores, they are allowed to live here. That is part of being a family and being part of a team. We all have to do our part. I do plenty I don\u2019t get paid for. I do give them opportunities to earn money above and beyond their chores for pocket money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe ask for that to be lowered a fair bit 50-65 a month is fair. My advice would be: 200 a month however half goes to a savings account and she needs to help a lot more around the house, maybe get a few hobbies. IDK tho really it\u2019s something you definitely need to take up with Don and is definitely a major concern.\n\nNTA also no way is neglect even involved here", "NTA. So NTA!  My experience with my eldest daughter was so similar that this made me laugh at a memory. When discussing allowance again, I got frustrated and said to my daughter, \"No one gets money for existing. We don't deserve payment simply because we breathe.\" We eventually made an agreement where each chore had a value, and she was paid for what she completed. If it was not done on our agreed upon days, no payment was given. \n\nSome days, my eldest was a challenge in how she tried my patience. It was very difficult because I was the only one to teach her what growing up needed to be. I yearned for when I could be more than just \"the heavy,\" her father's nickname for me because of discipline and structure. She is 26 now, and a nurse who is to be married in November. While we aren't best friends, we enjoy hiking, shopping, doing crafty, cooking, home things, even just hanging out with tea and books. Take a deep breath, do the best you can, and remind your daughter that you love her no matter what.", "I never got an allowance when I was growing up. And I still did a lot of chores since I was the only child. A kid isn\u2019t entitled to an allowance.", "NTA, and if she thinks that's neglect it shows how well you've sheltered her from the harsh realities of this world.\n\nKeep her on the track to be a successful adult, even though she's resisting it - try to demonstrate a little more of the consequences of actions (specifically in rewarding good behaviors and try not to react to the bad behaviors). It's hard to predict whether she'll ever recognize the benefits of what you're trying to teach, but if she can create some good habits you'll be able to tell.", "NTA\n\nShe shouldn't have to work for a basic allowance! With $100 every two weeks from her grandparents, that is taken care off. If they withdraw their generousity it would fall back to you and your ex to provide for a basic allowance. The details about how much is basic and what you should and could ain't a topic for this discussion.  \n\n\n>She says all her friends get an allowance from both their parents and that I should give her money for doing her homework and keeping her room clean, but honestly, it\u2019s a fight to get her to do even that.\n\nBonus allowens comes AFTER successfully doing these things for the week, simple as that. Failed to accomplish those things, next week she has a new chance to get her bonus for that week.", "NTA. You should also stop paying for lunches. She is old enough to make lunches so go to the store get food tell her if she wants to eat she will make her lunch. In addition pocket money is for chores above the normal expected ones for being part of the family. If she wants money she will do her homework, do the chores and maintain a pleasant attitude. She will get her pocket money every 2 weeks. My mother had my sister and I washing our own clothes at 7 years old and making our own lunches along with chores so your teen can step up!", "NTA.", "She gets $100 every two weeks by the grandparents, what else does she want lol that's more than enough she's 14. She should learn to not spend everything at once and then complain she wants more.", "NTA. Nobody will ever give her anything in her life for her lack of effort going forward. She might as well learn that now.", "op=NTA\n\nnope on allowance for those things.  Those are her \"duties\" as a child(homework) and human being(room clean)", "Nope NTA ... at all... an allowance isn't a right. \n\nBut do it's been said an allowance also ISN'T given for chores; chores and helping in a shared home are a given and a responsibility so basing her allowance off her contribution isn't valid anyways. \n\nPull up the parenting experts suggestions and go by that....$1/yr of age .... So she'll get $14/week... sit her down and explain that you'll give her the $14/wk BUT you're gonna do homemade lunches since school lunches aren't a right either. She can chose to use her allowance money for her lunches or keep her $$and eat cold lunch. \n\nLastly while it's good co- parenting to observe similar routines and things on custody time; your ex has ZERO obligation to abide by your standards, routines, or rules. ZERO. And you have ZERO right to push them. What he's doing is manipulative and detrimental parenting but that's his prerogative. \n\nPersonally I would sit her down and explain your expectations. Clean room. Laundry. Dishes or whatever weekly chores. And monthly chores. If she chooses not to do them then she can chose not to have her access to anything on her cel phone and use parenting apps to remove it.", "NTA. $200/mo with no strings attached is already a ton, and you pay for her needs. At 14, she should be old enough to get an afterschool/weekend/summer job if she wants more money. A very fair compromise for her would be to just volunteer to dive her to interviews/to work. She might find the experience civilizing.", "Her father refuses and says she doesn\u2019t need therapy but I\u2019m working on it. I am already in therapy.", "*they are allowed to live here*\n\nAs opposed to what? And they're not *allowed* they're *required* by law to be housed by you if you don't wanna be charged with neglect of a minor.\n\nI'm not saying allowance is required but what you said sounds horrible, like they should be happy that you, a person who decided to create them, are allowing them to have shelter. Like, what the fuck?", "\"allowed to live here\". Of course they are! They are your kids! They are your responsibility. But I think I kind of agree with you. I just wouldn't phrase it like that.\nI don't personally think kids should get allowance for doing chores, because chores are something we all do. I don't get paid for cleaning my own home and kids aren't either because it is part of living. We all do our part.\n\nIt's also important to teach these things to your child because our job as parents is to teach the child to be independent and able to live in the world. The monthly allowance is also part of teaching your child to handle money. But it's not something you are always entitled to even if you misbehave.", "If Amy is also having school problems, ask her teacher to recommend family therapy as it usually goes better than you recommending it."]}
