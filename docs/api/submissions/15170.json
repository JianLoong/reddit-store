She needs discipline from her father, not an allowance.", "NTA, she's getting a huge amount of money already and it certainly isn't neglect. She's about old enough to work, if you wanted to give her the opportunity to make money put the onus on her to show how many hours of work she is doing and what that is worth to her, then have her research local jobs and get a sense of what she can expect in a year or two with a part time job.\n\nAccountability outside you and your ex husband is probably the only hope for righting her course at this point. Have her get a part-time job or volunteer, both to get her some experience and consequences, but also to help prep her for college applications and independence down the line. 100 a week on clothes and makeup is an insane amount of wasted money. She needs to understand what it means to earn it.\n\nHer dad needs to also cut it out with the money before she hits adulthood totally unable to fend for herself.", ">She says all her friends get an allowance from both their parents and that I should give her money for doing her homework and keeping her room clean\n\n\n\nNo, she really shouldn\u2019t. There is no point arguing with a bratty 14 year old. She believes she is entitled to an allowance, she absolutely isn\u2019t, but likely won\u2019t understand that until she experiences people living more difficult lives then her own. She\u2019s going to go to her friends who will agree with her and tell her you are a terrible mean monster. The fact that she used the word neglect is telling, she has no idea about life.\n\n\nNTA and don\u2019t feel bad about it, regardless of how she will try to make you.", "NTA. Every kid tells their parents their friends all get allowances and their friends parents are better. It's just typical teenager behavior.", "NTA, your daughter is spoiled, and your ex fostered that behavior. I probably wouldn't be able to talk to him without screaming.", "Nta.. my parents never gave me an allowance and I was never bratty enough to say that it was neglect. Don has spoiled her stupid clearly and you are doing the right thing as a mother to bring her back down to earth. Now would be a good time to teach budgeting. $100 every 2 weeks on makeup and clothes at that age is ridiculous. She could be saving up so much.", "I know how frustrating it is to try to coparent with someone who won't be a team with you, and it's a constant comparison. I read in the comments that you are in therapy...have you thought of doing some together with your daughter? My daughter and I were going through a rocky time when she was at that age, and we did monthly sessions together, in addition to her weekly one on ones, and it was super helpful. Probably saved our mother/daughter relationship and helped us see each other's perspectives. It sounds like your daughter is being manipulated to choose one parent over the other, and you just can't take that laying down. You may not have any control over what happens at his house, but you do control yours. \n\nPer the actual situation at hand, I don't think any kid deserves an allowance for, as you said, just existing. School work, doing her own laundry and keeping a clean room are minimum expectations for her own personal upkeep. Who else is going to do those things? If she were doing some additional chores, that would be different. I think the purpose of an allowance, for parents who choose to do that, is to teach the value of working for something. So I'm going with NTA. I hope you and your daughter can find some middle ground.", "NTA-and to her argument, We didn\u2019t give out allowances to any of mine (nor pay them for grades or completing chores). If any of my kids needed something, we bought it. If they didn\u2019t need it, we didn\u2019t buy it.", "NTA you explained your reasons OP, now go through with it. Be the voice of reason. As she gets older, have certain conversations early. Also, just start listening. Look at other resources about how to do gentle parenting. Her room's a mess and she can't find something? Tell her that she'll find it eventually. No worries.", "NTA, but her father is.", "NTA even without the Grandparents contribution. $200 a month is a crazy amount for a 14 year old. I'm not surprised she's spoiled. Ideally you'd all be a united front, with that money being conditional upon her completing chores at both homes, but I fear you're perhaps fighting a losing battle here.", "NTA. he is. she's spoiled.", "NTA. I never had an allowance growing up. I was still expected to do chores around the house without complaint.", "NTA\nShe already gets a very generous allowance of $2400/yr. If she saved up for a few months she can buy herself almost anything a teenager could want. Going any further with the allowance would just teach her bad spending habits.", "NTA...it sounds like she has all that she needs.", "NTA.  *Good* parenting is tough, and it seems that your ex takes the easy way out, at your daughter's long-term peril. **Good for you** for thinking of her in the long term.  \n\n\nIt may be that you need a completely different tact in how to handle your daughter; in the face of the parenting vacuum created by your ex, traditional methods may fall flat.....", "NTA.  At her age, I didn\u2019t have an allowance.  I had to ask for money, or save birthday/Christmas money, or help around the house to earn it.  I probably got about $40/month for the mall or movies with friends by asking, though I usually had to give back anything I didn\u2019t spend (and my mom taught me to be pretty choosy about how I spent my money - we were house-poor for a couple chunks of my childhood, and she grew up poor due to having 10 siblings, so I knew the value of money even when I didn\u2019t have to earn it).  It\u2019s been 25 years, so that\u2019s about a third of what your daughter is getting as allowance from her grandparents.  If she\u2019s not willing to earn a second allowance, it seems silly to me that she thinks she should have one.", "NTA she will have a rude awakening ....", "\u201cMom\u2019s the boss but while you\u2019re here you can do whatever you want\u201d : coward parenting at its finest !

My children do not get allowance for chores, they are allowed to live here. That is part of being a family and being part of a team. We all have to do our part. I do plenty I don\u2019t get paid for.

Maybe ask for that to be lowered a fair bit 50-65 a month is fair. My advice would be: 200 a month however half goes to a savings account and she needs to help a lot more around the house, maybe get a few hobbies. IDK tho really it\u2019s something you definitely need to take up with Don and is definitely a major concern.\n\nNTA also no way is neglect even involved here", "NTA. So NTA!  My experience with my eldest daughter was so similar that this made me laugh at a memory. When discussing allowance again, I got frustrated and said to my daughter, \"No one gets money for existing. We don't deserve payment simply because we breathe.\" We eventually made an agreement where each chore had a value, and she was paid for what she completed. If it was not done on our agreed upon days, no payment was given. \n\nSome days, my eldest was a challenge in how she tried my patience. It was very difficult because I was the only one to teach her what growing up needed to be. I yearned for when I could be more than just \"the heavy,\" her father's nickname for me because of discipline and structure. She is 26 now, and a nurse who is to be married in November. While we aren't best friends, we enjoy hiking, shopping, doing crafty, cooking, home things, even just hanging out with tea and books. Take a deep breath, do the best you can, and remind your daughter that you love her no matter what.", "I never got an allowance when I was growing up. And I still did a lot of chores since I was the only child. A kid isn\u2019t entitled to an allowance.", "NTA, and if she thinks that's neglect it shows how well you've sheltered her from the harsh realities of this world.\n\nKeep her on the track to be a successful adult, even though she's resisting it - try to demonstrate a little more of the consequences of actions (specifically in rewarding good behaviors and try not to react to the bad behaviors). It's hard to predict whether she'll ever recognize the benefits of what you're trying to teach, but if she can create some good habits you'll be able to tell.", "NTA\n\nShe shouldn't have to work for a basic allowance! With $100 every two weeks from her grandparents, that is taken care off. If they withdraw their generousity it would fall back to you and your ex to provide for a basic allowance. The details about how much is basic and what you should and could ain't a topic for this discussion.  \n\n\n>She says all her friends get an allowance from both their parents and that I should give her money for doing her homework and keeping her room clean, but honestly, it\u2019s a fight to get her to do even that.\n\nBonus allowens comes AFTER successfully doing these things for the week, simple as that. Failed to accomplish those things, next week she has a new chance to get her bonus for that week.", "NTA. You should also stop paying for lunches. She is old enough to make lunches so go to the store get food tell her if she wants to eat she will make her lunch. In addition pocket money is for chores above the normal expected ones for being part of the family. If she wants money she will do her homework, do the chores and maintain a pleasant attitude. She will get her pocket money every 2 weeks. My mother had my sister and I washing our own clothes at 7 years old and making our own lunches along with chores so your teen can step up!", "NTA.", "She gets $100 every two weeks by the grandparents, what else does she want lol that's more than enough she's 14. She should learn to not spend everything at once and then complain she wants more.", "NTA. Nobody will ever give her anything in her life for her lack of effort going forward. She might as well learn that now.", "op=NTA\n\nnope on allowance for those things.  Those are her \"duties\" as a child(homework) and human being(room clean)", "Nope NTA ... at all... an allowance isn't a right. \n\nBut do it's been said an allowance also ISN'T given for chores; chores and helping in a shared home are a given and a responsibility so basing her allowance off her contribution isn't valid anyways. \n\nPull up the parenting experts suggestions and go by that....$1/yr of age .... So she'll get $14/week... sit her down and explain that you'll give her the $14/wk BUT you're gonna do homemade lunches since school lunches aren't a right either. She can chose to use her allowance money for her lunches or keep her $$and eat cold lunch. \n\nLastly while it's good co- parenting to observe similar routines and things on custody time; your ex has ZERO obligation to abide by your standards, routines, or rules. ZERO. And you have ZERO right to push them. What he's doing is manipulative and detrimental parenting but that's his prerogative. \n\nPersonally I would sit her down and explain your expectations. Clean room. Laundry. Dishes or whatever weekly chores. And monthly chores. If she chooses not to do them then she can chose not to have her access to anything on her cel phone and use parenting apps to remove it.", "NTA. $200/mo with no strings attached is already a ton, and you pay for her needs. At 14, she should be old enough to get an afterschool/weekend/summer job if she wants more money. A very fair compromise for her would be to just volunteer to dive her to interviews/to work. She might find the experience civilizing.", "Her father refuses and says she doesn\u2019t need therapy but I\u2019m working on it. I am already in therapy.", "*they are allowed to live here*\n\nAs opposed to what? And they're not *allowed* they're *required* by law to be housed by you if you don't wanna be charged with neglect of a minor.\n\nI'm not saying allowance is required but what you said sounds horrible, like they should be happy that you, a person who decided to create them, are allowing them to have shelter. Like, what the fuck?", "\"allowed to live here\". Of course they are! They are your kids! They are your responsibility. But I think I kind of agree with you. I just wouldn't phrase it like that.\nI don't personally think kids should get allowance for doing chores, because chores are something we all do. I don't get paid for cleaning my own home and kids aren't either because it is part of living. We all do our part.\n\nIt's also important to teach these things to your child because our job as parents is to teach the child to be independent and able to live in the world. The monthly allowance is also part of teaching your child to handle money. But it's not something you are always entitled to even if you misbehave.", "If Amy is also having school problems, ask her teacher to recommend family therapy as it usually goes better than you recommending it.", "I\u2019m a psychologist who works primarily with trauma and neglect, and I legitimately laughed out loud when you said your daughter accused you of neglect for not giving her an allowance. \n\nNeglect would be failing to feed or house her. Neglect would be failing to take her to the hospital after she broke her neck in a car accident. Neglect would be refusing to take her to a therapist and calling her \u201cdramatic\u201d if she became suicidally depressed. That\u2019s what my clients go through every single day and it\u2019s amazing to me that your daughter thinks her experiences come anywhere close to this.  \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for refusing to give her an allowance. She\u2019s done absolutely nothing to earn one and if she wants money that badly, she can work for it - babysitting, mowing lawns, whatever. She\u2019s old enough to learn how the world works. And crying \u201cneglect\u201d just because she doesn\u2019t get her way ain\u2019t it. \n\nI wish I had more detailed advice for how to handle things with your daughter, but my specialization is adults. What I *can* tell you is that teenagers tend to think in very black-and-white patterns and are also quite egotistical. It\u2019s a natural part of brain development and with the correct guidance, they become less self-absorbed. For now, maybe you could tell your daughter that you want to be able to understand her perspective, and you\u2019d also like her to understand yours. Maybe write a list of all the things you have to do to keep the house running - be *super* detailed. Including things like cleaning the floors, cleaning windows and walls, cleaning out sink drains, paying property insurance, car registration, income tax, etc. literally everything you can think of. Then explain to her that these are all things you do *for free* because it is the expectation of an adult to do these things. The expectation of a teenager is *at minimum* to do their homework and clean their room. So if she would like to be rewarded for going above and beyond, she needs to *do* something to be rewarded. And again, make sure you explain to her that you want to understand her perspective as well (given that teenagers are egotistical, this will be essential so that she feels validated and understood). \n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA\n\nI don't give my kids allowance either. They all do their own chores, keep their rooms clean and do their own laundry. They also make good grades, shower and go to bed at a decent time. I'm also divorced from their dad and he has a different set of rules as well. Sounds like Amy is entitled but it's your job as her mom to stick to your guidelines and boundaries. It's hard but she has to learn some way.", "NTA, however it's too bad she doesn't seem to have a clue about setting money aside and good luck trying to do that with the allowance she gets from others. Maybe, instead of giving her an allowance, you could set money aside for her with middle to long term goals of her choosing? It could also be a holiday somewhere with you.  Be transparent but don't give it access to her just yet?", "NTA - that appears to be your ex's position.", "NTA\u2026oh boy, if everyone does it, then do must you!  Hmmm\u2026I wonder how many of those parents buy their kids school lunches or make them pack?  How many get money for the bud plus an allowance?  How many get 200 a month?   I might do a sort of chat and find out just how much the other kids get, because I guarantee they are not getting 200.", "NTA. She doesn't need hundreds of dollars every month. She needs some discipline and structure. My father raised me with \"There's no point in getting an allowance. One day you'll be an adult. Nobody is going to reward you for washing dishes or folding laundry\". Your ex and his parents are setting your daughter up for future struggles and failure.", "nta", "Unfortunately he refuses to discipline her as he says it doesn\u2019t work. He said to me the other week that she has him wrapped around her little finger. He sounded almost proud.", "Here I was, thinking the other day that \"hmm, my 40 dollars a month is actually a bit high for allowance now that I think about it\"\n\nApparently not. 200 is a high allowance lol.", "Amy is so used to having her dad give her everything that she\u2019s unable to see the value of money, hard work and discipline. She sees me as an inconvenience and my attempts to teach her good habits as an impediment to the life she wants. She thinks her dad will always be there to bail her out or pay for whatever she ruins, and maybe he will. Maybe I\u2019ll always be the bad guy to her, the one who says no where Don always says yes. But at least I know I tried my best to teach Amy what I could, and when I say no, it is not out of malice or cruelty, no matter what she believes. \n\nI know teenagers are inherently selfish creatures but I\u2019m just so tired of being unable to reach her. I can\u2019t force her to grow up into a good, empathic person. I tried, but it has been so hard. Don said to me that he wants to be her confidant, the parent she trusts and goes to for advice all the time. The implication being that I, in the background, am the cruel, evil witch trying to thwart him. I have never stood in the way of his relationship with her but I think now that I should have stood for something more than I did, rather than remaining agreeable and refusing to choose my own battles because I was afraid of him making things difficult for us. \n\nI am trying now, with a lot of therapy behind me, but I fear it may be too little, too late. We have family counselling booked, with Amy to see the psychologist first. I hope it helps her. I don\u2019t know what to do otherwise.", "It is hard, believe me. I never wanted to get in between them but maybe I should have.", "Yes, I have family counselling set up for Amy and I, to focus on Amy and her anger first. But she is mostly just angry with me so I imagine I\u2019ll come into it fairly early on. I am so scared of her and for her. All the time.", "Yes. He was very clever in manoeuvring it so that he has always remained in a favourable position in Amy\u2019s eyes. All that matters to him is being seen as the good guy who is doing right by everyone. So he panders to me by saying he agrees with me but it\u2019s never \u201cwe, your parents have decided\u201d - it\u2019s \u201cyour mother has decided. Your mother is the boss. Your mother has the final say.\u201d When it comes to any difficult decision or getting her to do something, like getting an eye test or going to the doctor or attending counselling. Everything with Amy has this undercurrent of defiance and resentment and I am fairly certain now that Don is the source. I have done a lot of reading on parental alienation. He has never had a partner since I left him 13 years ago. My husband (I remarried when Amy was 4) thinks he still carries a torch or obsession for me, or still wants to control me, and he has been using Amy to do so. If so - it\u2019s sick. But I don\u2019t know what I can do. \n\nAmy worships her dad and threatens frequently to leave to go live with him. Fortunately, she likes her current group of friends at school, and Don lives far enough away that she would have to change schools if she did move. So she is staying with me during the week. But it\u2019s so hard. So, so hard. I feel so sad for her, knowing the loneliness and misery she may face if she decides to be this kind of person.", "I am glad your daughter came around and you have a better relationship. I long for the same one day. My own mother passed when I was 22, and we had a love/hate relationship. I never got to apologise to her for treating her like crap when I was 13. \n\nWe tried the chores with value thing, she stopped doing the chores after a couple weeks because it wasn\u2019t enough money. I couldn\u2019t afford more. She can just get more from her dad or his parents, and does anyway. She comes home after her weekends with him and shows me all the things she bought. She is always so proud and happy, but she just leaves things all over the floor and they get ruined in the end.", "Thank you. I try to explain things to her but she just doesn\u2019t think these things apply to her or that she will have to do them for herself eventually. She usually falls back on the old \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about that now\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll be rich and get a servant\u201d.\n\nAmy has always lacked empathy and will focus only on what she wants to the exclusion of all else, and it\u2019s only gotten worse with puberty. I can only hope with counselling and time she will come to see that I\u2019m not out to destroy her life but to help her build a better one.", "Have you told her any of this?", "Aww hugs, Mama. I promise you, this is only one season of life \u2764\ufe0f", "Yeah I am actually surprised that she doesn\u2019t live with her Dad full time. Do you think he would allow it? Just because he has her on the weekends doesn\u2019t mean he wants to be a full time parent. \n\nKeep doing what you are doing, it may stick. Truthfully 14 is a hard age in general. She may grow up and mature. That just takes time.", "I hear you and understand what you are going through. His family had what I thought was tons of money, bought her whatever she desired when she was with them, and when her father saw her she could do anything she pleased. And I am talking Italian leather bags, Coach purses, shoes, a fur coat, Clinique makeup, things that I could and would, never dream of spending that much on. The majority of the things laid on her floor and were ruined. One or two things I saved, only to sell second hand when she was in need of a car. Because in between these spending sprees, her father was either not paying support, or paying less than ordered and with my income and eventual full medical disability; money was very tight. However she never went without a need. She may have gone without many of her wants, without designer and name brand items from me, etc... But she also learned the value of yard sales, thrift store shopping, using Facebook marketplace, and upcycling or refinishing what is an item that has a life left in it. Sadly, both sets of her grandparents are no longer with us. You have my deepest sympathy with your grief over your mother. I am sorry you did not get the opportunity to say what was so important. The mother in me believes that she understood; but I cannot be certain. Now that his parents are gone, he learned there was not a huge sum of money to draw from once the debts were paid. \nI guess what I am trying to say is that our children, most children- learn far more from our consistent actions.  She may be giving you an awful, challenging, painful time now; but hold onto hope that it could be different. Youth and money do not last forever. I know your love and dedication to her does. She may put you through so much heartache for years yet... But with your great example to lead her, I hold out hope for your daughter. Don't lose hope. You are doing a great job.  \n\nA social worker friend of mine says often that angst, ennui, and discontent with just about everything that isn't exactly their way should be part of the definition of teenager.", "Maybe it's time for Dad to get full custody, since he has no issues with her issues? And your issues are directly related to his lack of parenting.", "NTA. I've never had an allowance in my entire life and my cousins who are your daughters age haven't either. She sounds incredibly spoiled.", "NTA. Give her a list of what you expect. she must do it for 1 month with no exceptions, no missed chores. Once she gets to the end of that month, you will pay her for the CHORES (not cleaning her own room or washing her own clothes, those are her personal things that she does for herself) which are things for the communal household. And then pay her weekly after ALL chores are done correctly. Thats the deal, no negotiation, no arguments and if she tries to argue its back to square one where she has to do a solid month before the allowance resumes.", "NTA for sure, he is not doing her any favors by refusing to prepare her for adulthood. I do want to suggest one thing in case you haven\u2019t tried it that may hopefully help get her to do chores. It may also be helpful when it comes to her being mad you won\u2019t give her allowance if she\u2019s only willing to do her laundry.\n\nMaybe you could take an hourly rate and break down chores to how much time they may take on average, then offer that much in allowance for each chore completed. Maybe do the same with completing school work, but preferably not based on grades since the main goal to start should be just getting her school work done. That way he\u2019s not her only source of money and while she\u2019s still gonna be upset that the chores are how she earns it at your house, she will have motivation.\n\nI\u2019m betting that\u2019s pretty much what you did originally, but were you giving her the same amount regardless of how many of her chores she completed? If that\u2019s the case then maybe she just figured doing the bare minimum in chores didn\u2019t matter because completing them all made no difference in how much she got. He is undoing work you are trying to do with your daughter to help her grow up to be independent, he\u2019s pretty much just being the fun parent. Fun parents are fine to an extent, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have to actually parent. It should just mean that the kid is able to enjoy time with their parent, not the dynamic your ex has created. It\u2019s unfair to you and it\u2019s unfair to your daughter, how is she supposed to be able to take of herself one day if she never learns how to or builds the habits she will need in life.\n\nOne other question which may or may not be relevant, but has she been tested for ADHD or any learning differences? Even with everything he is doing that is causing these issues with your daughter it may be possible there is more contributing than just him. Executive dysfunction causes so many of the things you described, like issues with even completing schoolwork or doing any chores, hell even the way it seems like she argues with you since emotional dysregulation is a major aspect. It may be worth looking in to. Your ex is definitely creating the perfect environment for the issues happening with your daughter, but the way you describe them makes it seem like more could be going on, especially since she only seems him on weekends. I\u2019m autistic/adhd and can see similarities to how I was over these things at her age, although I didn\u2019t receive allowance or have divorced parents.\n\nI\u2019m not saying I think she for sure has ADHD, just that it could be worth looking into and getting her evaluated. I have a lot of helpful resources I would be happy to send you, that way even if she doesn\u2019t have it you still have access to them. A lot of the resources have helpful advice about these things that can be applied to kids who aren\u2019t neurodivergent in some way.\n\nGood luck, you are stuck in a rough situation. My sister and her husband are going through similar with their daughter/my niece at the moment and my sister talks to me about it often. It\u2019s taking a toll on her, I can only imagine how much of one this is taking on you. I hope things begin to improve, teenagers are rough and an ex who refuses to coparent make it even harder.", "So ask her for the contact info for her friend\u2019s parents. You probably want to know these people anyway. Bet she doesn\u2019t want you to talk to them.  \n\nShe can earn money babysitting, doing yard work and running errands, tutoring younger kids, or walking dogs.  Explain that the allowance her dad gives her is her allowance and any extra she wants she can earn.  \nHow were you raised by the way?", "NTA.  She's getting more than enough money for doing absolutely nothing.", "Has your daughter been to therapy? Have you let your ex know he's raising an entitled brat and NOT setting her up for success? Have you explained to your daughter that you're trying to mold her into an adult?", "NTA - make a chart of all the things you give her an allowance for and the price associated with it.  Have her check it off and prove she did it and pay her for just that thing.  If she stops doing it, show her the chart and say it's up to you to do it and earn the allowance.   Don't get into any further discussions.", "Great, he can fund her life until she gets married then. I really can't see her having the discipline to go to college and graduate or stay long enough at one employer.", "Wow, I wonder whose f-king fault is that! Unbelievable.", "How is she going to be rich though? What's her plan there?\n\nMy dad was rich, but he certainly isn't now. Any number of things can happen to wipe a person out financially."]}
