Adoptions, nor raising kids is suitable for everybody.", "NTA - I can see why your friend brought it up but she should have dropped it. It was a nice suggestion but once you made it clear that adoption wasn't what you wanted, her insisting you make a super important life decision and then hanging up on you when you declined was rude and immature on her part.

There's no guarantees there either because sometimes the most relevant factor is how cut you are to be a parent. My parents had one adopted child (me) and one biological child (my sibling), and our mother never came around to loving and bonding with either of us. Parenthood was not for her. \n\nTotally different story with our dad -- he loved us and bonded with us and saw us equally as his children, biology be damned. My sibling and I joke about who got which genes even though there is no shared DNA between us. The only time it has ever been any kind of consideration is when it comes to medical history.\n\nAmy was unacceptably preachy and pushy. Also a hypocritic by saying adoption is better when she didn't adopt her own children, which is a hurtful attitude towards her biological children. You're n.t.a. for saying and knowing that you don't believe you could love an adopted child, but you chose incredibly hurtful language.  \"Nothing but a consolation prize\" was a horrible thing to say to an adopted person.

I agree with others that your friend could have let the topic drop a little sooner, but it\u2019s also great that she is so enthusiastic about adoption as an adoptee. Not all adoptees feel that way. I don\u2019t think YTA because you want to pursue fertility treatments but to talk to an adopted person as you did is pretty rude.\n\nAlso, I do think she is right that people can absolutely open their hearts to love children who are not of their own bodies. If you\u2019re really not interested in it, that\u2019s fine, but looking at adoption as second-best is sad.", "NTA\n\nDear Amy just kept pushing and pushing and pushing.

That's absolutely your choice and she doesn't have any say in what you do for your family.\n\nThat being said, I do think your views on adoption is a bit of an issue. Even if that's how you feel, I can see exactly why that would hurt Amy's feelings. Even if it's just your personal feelings and you're fine with adoption in general, it can sting to hear that someone feels like adoption can be viewed as a consolation prize and that you can't love or bond with an adopted child just because they're not biologically related. I think it can be a dangerously closed-off mindset that no adopted child wants to hear. I know it's why these feelings are preventing adoption from being an option for your family, and that's clearly a smart decision, but I do think the way you told her can be seen as cruel and misinterpreted to your feelings on adoption in general.", "YTA.  I was with you until you said adopted children are a \"consolation prize\"  Who the hell talks about a child like that?!?  Seriously?!?  A human is not something you go win at a fair. Your comment was repulsive.", "NTA. My husband and I had 3 miscarriages in a row and he still feels the same as you and I respect that. I hope you guys get your baby soon <3", "NTA. I specifically pick NTA because Amy *is* being an asshole. Cannot stand self-absorbed people who think what's right for them is the universal only right way to be, and anyone who differs has something wrong with them.", "NTA\n\nAdoption is not for everyone. Even though she is adopted, she herself has 2 biological kids. Not to say she won't adopt in the future, but she already has what you want for you so in my point of view she was beyond insensitive, specially after you told her multiple times you were not interested in that.\n\nYou might have been a bit hard with your words, but she was so insistent you ran out of appropriate excuses. And to be honest, a child really is not a toy or dress you get to pick and take home and see if you like it. It's a commitment for life, and if you don't love that child like your own, they will know, and that is not fair on them.", "NTA. \n\nAdoption isn\u2019t for everyone.

Adoption isn\u2019t for everyone and that is absolutely okay.", "NAH. On your end, anyone who tells you how *you'll* feel or how you *should* feel about being a parent is a moron. No one gets to tell you what you can and can't be comfortable with. Just like childfree people getting told how they'll change their mind later. It's fine to want kids but not want to adopt.  You alone know yourself and what situations would and wouldn't bring out the best in you as a parent.  \n\nHaving said that, you're an adult.  You *have* to have learned by now that rejecting someone's identity so tactlessly to their face was a bad idea. The only reason I don't call you an AH here is because you tried to side step and she kept pushing her views on you, which makes it a wash. \n\nOn her end, I get it. Millions of kids need homes and she knows first hand great it can be.  She wants to share that joy with others. That's lovely.  What isn't lovely is trying to tell others how they will or should feel about something as big as children. \n\nYou're each entitled to your own views of the world and to your own views of yourselves.

If Amy felt that passionately about adopting why did she have two biological children and no adopted children?", "I get that adoption is not for everyone but i don\u2019t like how you say that adopted children are consolation prize.

It's a lengthy process with a lot of costs. I know people who have adopted. Between actual adoption fees, plus the entire process with screenings and home visits, etc., they've said it ends up costing between 75-100k per child. And it takes between 1-2 years to adopt.

And the child can have trauma resulting from it. \n\nI wish you the best of luck in your fertility treatment.", "ESH but more so Amy.

Having or not having children, and how you choose to do it, is an intensely personal decision. She shouldn't have pushed. And you are both right that adoption should never be thought of as a backup plan for people who are disappointed they can't conceive biological children.

She needed to be put in her place.", "Because she was getting pushy and not accepting earlier answer?", "I didn\u2019t read OP\u2019s comment as calling Amy a \u201cconsolation prize\u201d, but of how he\u2019d feel about an adoptee versus a biological child. \n\nI\u2019m an adoptee, and I\u2019ve spoke with several adoptees whose adoptive parents were infertile and did treat them like a consolation prize.\n\nI\u2019m honestly glad that OP was truly honest about how he\u2019d feel about adopting now so that an adoptee isn\u2019t brought into a situation where they are thought of as a consolation prize because that is just unfair to them. \n\nI think Amy as an adoptee took those words personally.", "He said he didn't think he should adopt, because he doesn't think he'd be able to get over thinking of adoption in that way. And he's right. People who think of adoption as a backup plan to embark on only after conceiving biologically has failed shouldn't be adoptive parents.", "He gets to have his feelings.  She needed to shut up.", "I think you should read the post again.", "Care to explain? I think it's clear OP isn't an asshole at all, and only opened up to more directly and honestly explain their feelings/fears when pushed to because his friend wouldn't accept his initial response. It's a clear NTA.", "I could be mistaken but I don't think he was referring to all adopted children as a consolation prize. I believe he was saying that's how he would feel personally which would not be fair to the child. And I believe the woman he was speaking to was adopted herself, she does not have adopted children. I think maybe his wording was poor, but she kinda kept pushing him after he simply said adoption was great but just wasn't for him.", "The way I read that is that Amy said consolation prize, not OP.", "Yea was going to add this re costs - if ivf works for them, it would likely be cheaper than adopting ultimately and may even take a shorter amount of time.", "Now you're doing the same thing Amy did. Do you really think that OP and his spouse are unaware of the existence of surrogates? They should consider exactly what they want to consider, and nothing else.", "I have loved many kids that weren't mine. Nieces and cousins and kids at the preschool where I worked. I would have given my life to save theirs. That being said, when my daughter was born I felt a love like I never even thought was possible. An overwhelming supernatural type of love. So personally I would be afraid of having an adopted child that I may be lacking that exact same type of love for. Maybe I would feel the same for them, but I am not 100% sure. Therfore I think it would be wrong for me to adopt. I think many people feel this way and it doesn't make them selfish at all.", "She might have been an adopted child but she didn\u2019t adopt her children so I don\u2019t know what leg she has to stand on here.", "This in spades. Absolutely right to be honest with yourself when saying adoption is not for you, but you just told your friend she is her parents consolation prize. That was uncalled for, you can be honest without being mean.", "Oooooo that\u2019s good!!!", "Even a poorly phrased can pack a punch. That\u2019s clearly how the other person seemed to take it.", "Maybe this \u201cfriend\u201d will learn for next time.", "\u201cI\u2019m not interested in continuing this conversation, so I\u2019ll need to end it now. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\nAnd then hang up. Fewer words and less effort than what OP said. \n\nWould the friend still be mad? Yeah, probably. Would OP be an AH? Not in the slightest.", "I see, i read it \u201cadopted a baby\u201d.  Thanks.", "Nope. OP introduced that opinion.", "And maybe he\u2019ll also learn you can\u2019t call people consolation prizes\u2026 I hear a lot about adoption as my work is related to reproduction. But \u2018consolation prize\u2019 is a first and let\u2019s be honest it\u2019s awful. You can adjust it\u2019s not for you, that you don\u2019t know if you have the energy (it is a very long and taxing process), the requisite and so on, but calling a kid and your friend a consolation prize it\u2019s quite demeaning.", ">Amy was hurt, said that adopted children are not a consolation prize, and hung up on me. \n\nReally? Because the way the sentence is written, Amy is the one who expressed being hurt, and the one who hung up on OP, and there's nothing in between to suggest OP is the one who said it.", "She was warned to settle down. She refused. She got what she deserved."]}
