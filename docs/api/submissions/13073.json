She is a full time waitress and recently got pregnant and asked me for my advice on keeping it or not. I wasn\u2019t about to tell her what to do, so instead I just asked logical and realistic questions, e.g. it costs around 300k to raise a kid. Thats 1400 a month. Can you do that? You also live with roommates who probably don\u2019t want to hear a crying baby. Can u afford to move somewhere else? \n\nHer answer was that she isn\u2019t ready to have a kid, but can be when it comes, aka apparently have $10k saved up?\n\nAnyways, Imma not comment on that anymore. But to continue, I suggested maybe she think about something more sustainable instead of being a night waitress. It\u2019s inconsistent money in a volatile industry. And it\u2019s at night. Sure doing it now is easy bc ur young but imagine going to ur 7pm to 2am shift after taking care of a baby all day. And vice versa, being able to take care of a baby after working all night. \n\nShe took this offensively and then passive aggressively started sending me TikTok\u2019s about how waitresses and bartenders \u201cwho don\u2019t have real jobs\u201d make in one night what I make in 2 weeks (maybe not really aimed to me bc I make $150k). And then started to go on a rant about how she knows so many ppl who are waitresses and have families.\n\nI told her she twisted my words. Never said she didn\u2019t have a real job, I said maybe a job that isn\u2019t sustainable. I gave her the example of when I worked for an investment firm as an overnight trader. Obviously a real job just not sustainable.\n\nIdk I just thought my suggestion was a good one\u2026. Maybe too opinionated?\n\nEdit: I texted my friend and apologized if I came off rude and elaborated saying I meant to say that if you\u2019re going to have a baby, you should think about a job that has benefits, has PTO, maternity leave, etc.\nAnd also continuing to follow multiple of my fellow redditors\u2019 advice on NOT giving any more advice, telling her I\u2019m here for support, and that she should seek out women who have been in similar situations.

Like when you're planning on having a kid, you read, listen, and talk to people. You know that it is going to be exhausting, that you'll be sleep deprived, that you will have less free time.

Now, I have to say, that in my country, waitstaff works for a set monthly salary, and tips for waitstaff is just extra bonus/for fun. Mostly college students work in that branch because of the hours, but I also know of some single moms doing it. If it is different in your country, I understand your \u201cjudgement\u201d of the job, but also keep in mind, she must be very stressed out as well, plus hormones, so the wording you used, might have come off judgemental to her, hence her sending the tiktoks and mentioning what is earned in said profession. Waitressing is very hard, but she is used to it, so just because you wouldn\u2019t be able to do it, does not mean she won\u2019t be able to do it. She asked for your advice on what to do with her pregnancy, and instead, got some unwanted judgement about her job, so that makes me lean towards YTA.\n\nEdit: typo\n\nEdit two: I just read you hoped a parent would comment: I am a parent, my children are still children, but a bit older, and I am a single parent.", "NTA.

Being a waitress can be great money, but it\u2019s exhausting work, and unreliable. Add that to a night shift, It\u2019s just not realistic With a newborn. Plus, with the guy not being on board with keeping it, something tells me he\u2019ll only be helpful for so long.\n\nAnd her housing situation is no longer going to work. If this was a child, sure. But we\u2019re talking about an infant. Most roommates are not going to want to deal with that.\n\nHer entire situation sounds like it\u2019s something she could make do with when you have a child, not a newborn where the guy isn\u2019t emotionally all-in.\n\nIf she wants advice on what to do here, then she has to at least think about these questions in order to get the answer for herself. No one can tell her what to do here, but deep diving into this situation and looking at the future without the rose-colored glasses is what she has to do to find her answers.\n\nNTA", "NTA she didn't want your opinion she wanted your validation.", "NTA because she set you up to fail.

She knew what she wanted to hear and in her eyes anything else would have made you an AH.", "Info- is the baby daddy in the picture and does he plan on taking care of his child?", "NTA. You were being realistic and just trying to help your friend see the reality of parenting and the high costs that come with it.

It\u2019s gives me anxiety personally to give advice on kids bc I don\u2019t have any! And that\u2019s ANOTHER good point. She has no benefits as a waitress. I think she\u2019s on her parents benefits though I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll wave that off by saying the baby daddy is a teacher and can get benefits. \n\nAlso\u2014 she does not date the baby daddy but is convinced if she goes down this route of having a baby, she\u2019ll \u201cfall in love with him\u201d. I\u2019ve never been pregnant but do women usually become this hallucinogenic when pregnant? (Im 26F) I\u2019m sorry if that sounds mean.", "Yeah I personally think she\u2019s being selfish over wanting to keep it. And trying to make hypotheticals work (like I COULD be ready when it comes!) \n\nI also asked her about childcare but ur point is spot on. She needs to look for a babysitter that\u2019ll be available those hours. That\u2019s even worse", "Thank you. Maybe it\u2019s because I never really gave my opinion until the end bc I was trying ask questions and help her make her own decision", "I agree.

She hasn\u2019t texted me since (this happened yesterday evening) and I\u2019m not really too butt hurt over it bc it\u2019s just clear immaturity but.. idk I just hope she comes to her senses", "I appreciate you giving a different perspective. In the US, waitresses are legally allowed to be paid below the $7.25 national wage minimum. I think she once told me she gets paid like $5/hr? Can\u2019t say that with 100% confidence though. \n\nAgain, never said night waitressing wasn\u2019t a real job. I said it isn\u2019t a sustainable job.\n\nI think you\u2019re correct that maybe my wording wasn\u2019t the best.", "Yeah her maturity level is\u2026 personally not ready to have a kid imo. But I kinda refrained from saying harsh opinions like that", "She\u2019s told the baby daddy, who said he\u2019s supportive of either decision she makes but said he wants her to get an abortion. He said he\u2019d be there for the kid if she decided to keep it. Though he was really pushing for her to get an abortion, and from seeing the texts that he sent, was actually kinda manipulative about it imo. He would text as if she already made her mind up to get an abortion like \u201cI know it\u2019s hard what you\u2019re doing but I\u2019ll be there for you when you get it done\u201d", "Reading you have Asperger\u2019s clears up why you said what you said and in the way you did it. \n\nHer thinking it will be a magical falling in love with the baby\u2019s father, is probably very wishful thinking and not in a good way. I understand completely why you are not willing to say directly that having that baby would be a terrible idea, but maybe you can suggest her to talk to other women who have been in her shoes. Find them online, and hopefully hear from different women who went with different scenarios. (Women who went through with the pregnancy, as well as women who haven\u2019t.) \n\nBecoming a parent is something so out of the realm of what you can imagine in your head of what it\u2019s going to be like, it\u2019s setting expecting parents up for so much disappointment on what it\u2019s actually like to be a parent. Which is great, but also so very very difficult and comes with a lot of heartache.", "> but do women usually become this hallucinogenic when pregnant? (Im 26F)\n\nnah..it just sounds like she's immature and irresponsible.  Well also I'll clarify...I'm a man...so what do I know about being pregnant? During the early stages of pregnancy my wife was clearly hormonal, but she didn't have her head in the clouds.", "Mmmm.. you NTA but seems like you\u2019re navigating some slippery AF terrain.

You offered your advice when asked.  If it were me, moving forward, I would just offer support to the extent I can and hold back on advice.", "While you might not have said it with so many words, I think it is the way it came across to your friend. My sister also has asperger\u2019s, so that did clear up for me the way you reacted to your friend, but since you two are a lot younger than me and my sister, she probably has not developed the understanding, that comes with time and effort, to understand the way your brain works differently from hers. \n\nNTA is my final judgement, but please have another talk with her. Explaining that what you say, might sound rude or judgemental to her, but was never your intention, and try to best as you can, explain that you are just worried, BECAUSE you care.\n\nEdit: $5/$7 an hour is ridiculous, and while I applaud those who can raise their children on such a salary, would certainly not recommend, and even though the baby\u2019s father right now says he\u2019ll help, there are no guarantees in life, and she should expect to have to do this all by herself. No matter how good of a friend anyone is, no one can be co-parenting with her, there is going to come a time, when least convenient from my experience, where she has to work, but her baby will also be sick (pooping and throwing up the whole day, while running a fever). And there will be no one to come watch the baby, and her boss will most likely not care that she is unable to come in, and just find someone else to do her job. So yes, I understand completely now, what you been by not having a sustainable job.", "Nta\n\nAs others said, she asked your opinion, and you gave it. \n\nIf bf was all on board with an income to take care of baby and friend, then her pay becomes supplemental to household, but that doesn't sound like case. If he's pushing that hard for abortion, I think there's a solid chance his plan is to let friend be a single mother, and you were spot on that her roommates don't want a crying baby in the place, so she'll need to cover rent, childcare while at work, and all other hidden expenses of a baby.", "My friend knows this too and manages to remember it most of the time. But I think on a touchy subject like this it may be overlooked lol. Just out of curiosity, what was different about what I said and the way I did it?\n\nAlso\u2014 I agree with you. A lot of what she was saying was wishful thinking with no actual plan to implement it.\n\nShe\u2019s also said that her baby daddy and I were the only ones of her friend group to say she should get an abortion (me saying it indirectly by saying realistic things, I guess). Meanwhile\u2026 none of her friends have children.\n\nI think you\u2019re so right that she should speak to other women who actually have children. It\u2019s shoes I\u2019ve never been in and neither has she. If she decides to text me again then I won\u2019t offer any more advice, I\u2019ll just say that she should seek out women who have been in similar situations.\n\nThis was a great comment. Thank you.\n\nEdit: typo", "That\u2019s honestly what I figured. I think my friend is just immature and hoping for the best", "Yes I agree. It\u2019s already a sticky subject \ud83e\udee0 telling a woman what to do with her body.

But she got what she asked for but now I don\u2019t think I can give any advice lol", "To add to that, waitstaff jobs in the US typically do not have any health benefits. All of what you just said is true\u2026 especially about the part when, at the most inconvenient times, it appears there\u2019s nobody to watch your kids and risk losing your job\u2026 I am scared for her when that time comes, but most of all scared for her possible child", "From what I gather from your original post, you basically avoided her question, by deflecting and telling her, her job isn\u2019t sustainable. So, pitting myself in her shoes, I\u2019d probably be a little offended too, especially the pregnancy hormones really don\u2019t help lol. \nAt the heart of every argument, lies assumption. She probably assumed you would respond by either choosing one or the other, or just be cheerleading, like seemingly everyone else is. Putting myself in the position you were put in, I might have not have answered at all, but instead ask her, what she really wants, and what she needs to accomplish that, and then proceed from there. Tell her, that while you will root for her no matter what, you are scared for her and will not be cheering for choices that you think will not be the best for her/her situation.
