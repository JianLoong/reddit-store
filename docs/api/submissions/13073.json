She is a full time waitress and recently got pregnant and asked me for my advice on keeping it or not. I wasn\u2019t about to tell her what to do, so instead I just asked logical and realistic questions, e.g. it costs around 300k to raise a kid. Thats 1400 a month. Can you do that? You also live with roommates who probably don\u2019t want to hear a crying baby. Can u afford to move somewhere else? \n\nHer answer was that she isn\u2019t ready to have a kid, but can be when it comes, aka apparently have $10k saved up?\n\nAnyways, Imma not comment on that anymore. But to continue, I suggested maybe she think about something more sustainable instead of being a night waitress. It\u2019s inconsistent money in a volatile industry. And it\u2019s at night. Sure doing it now is easy bc ur young but imagine going to ur 7pm to 2am shift after taking care of a baby all day. And vice versa, being able to take care of a baby after working all night. \n\nShe took this offensively and then passive aggressively started sending me TikTok\u2019s about how waitresses and bartenders \u201cwho don\u2019t have real jobs\u201d make in one night what I make in 2 weeks (maybe not really aimed to me bc I make $150k). And then started to go on a rant about how she knows so many ppl who are waitresses and have families.\n\nI told her she twisted my words. Never said she didn\u2019t have a real job, I said maybe a job that isn\u2019t sustainable. I gave her the example of when I worked for an investment firm as an overnight trader. Obviously a real job just not sustainable.\n\nIdk I just thought my suggestion was a good one\u2026. Maybe too opinionated?\n\nEdit: I texted my friend and apologized if I came off rude and elaborated saying I meant to say that if you\u2019re going to have a baby, you should think about a job that has benefits, has PTO, maternity leave, etc.\nAnd also continuing to follow multiple of my fellow redditors\u2019 advice on NOT giving any more advice, telling her I\u2019m here for support, and that she should seek out women who have been in similar situations. It\u2019s been an hour that I\u2019ve been left on read :(. Oh well.\n\nEdit 2: she replied and said I won\u2019t ever know what she\u2019s feeling with being pregnant and having to abort it and now from my text she feels depressed. Tbh it kinda pissed me off and I basically went off saying that it\u2019s basically irresponsible for her to have a baby right now because her job can\u2019t support a baby, her baby daddy has one foot out the door but is saying different, she needs to find another (most likely more expensive) place to move to bc her roommates don\u2019t want to deal with a crying baby, and her other friends who are also her age and telling her to have the baby, are constantly doing drugs and partying all the time and are making empty promises to her saying they can watch her baby while she works a Friday and Saturday night shift. And lastly, I told her shes being extremely selfish and not considering the baby in any of this. With this response I am prepared to be called the AH, but my patience has run thin with helping\ud83d\ude02. I feel like nobody has come to her to tell her the realistic truth and she\u2019s been living in an immature fantasy land and the person who will be hurt the most from this delusion is her baby. This friendship is possibly over from this word vomit I texted her but I am okay with that. She sent a final text saying \u201cthanks for making me depressed. Now I\u2019m crying.

If it is different in your country, I understand your \u201cjudgement\u201d of the job, but also keep in mind, she must be very stressed out as well, plus hormones, so the wording you used, might have come off judgemental to her, hence her sending the tiktoks and mentioning what is earned in said profession.

Explaining that what you say, might sound rude or judgemental to her, but was never your intention, and try to best as you can, explain that you are just worried, BECAUSE you care.\n\nEdit: $5/$7 an hour is ridiculous, and while I applaud those who can raise their children on such a salary, would certainly not recommend, and even though the baby\u2019s father right now says he\u2019ll help, there are no guarantees in life, and she should expect to have to do this all by herself. No matter how good of a friend anyone is, no one can be co-parenting with her, there is going to come a time, when least convenient from my experience, where she has to work, but her baby will also be sick (pooping and throwing up the whole day, while running a fever). And there will be no one to come watch the baby, and her boss will most likely not care that she is unable to come in, and just find someone else to do her job.

A lot of what she was saying was wishful thinking with no actual plan to implement it.\n\nShe\u2019s also said that her baby daddy and I were the only ones of her friend group to say she should get an abortion (me saying it indirectly by saying realistic things, I guess).

If you are extremely wealthy, then you can afford to hire a nanny or use a very high quality licensed care facility. OR you can find an employer that offers day care on the facilities as part of the benefit package.\n\nSo the issue is that she has a completely unrealistic idea of how difficult it will be. For her to \\*brag\\* that she has $10,000 saved shows how little she understands the economics and logistics of raising a kid.\n\nAs you point out, she is going to have to find a new apartment - and probably one where she lives by herself. She is going to have to get some kind of furniture as well as baby stuff. You can scrounge around and minimize the cost but it is still expensive and the baby turns into a toddler so the costs keep going on.\n\nShe is young. Obviously she isn't in the kind of committed relationship where the man seems to be in the picture offering support - economic, emotional and logistical. \n\nObviously it is a woman's choice but I would never have chosen to have a baby at 24 under those circumstances.", "NTA for giving your opinion when asked. \n\nBut... From your post it sounds like you look down on people in the service industry and that vibe is probably what she is reacting to.", "YTA, because you are grossly exaggerating the cost.\n\n\"e.g. it costs around 300k to raise a kid\" That figure and similar always assume that (a) the parents need to buy a bigger house and (b) one parent - the mother, of course - will give up well-paying work for some years to bring up the children.\n\nIf it really cost $1400 a month to bring up a kid, practically nobody could do it. And yet here we all are.", "NTA", "NTA she asked for your advice and you answered. If she can\u2019t handle the realities of what it takes to raise a kid, then she shouldn\u2019t have one. There are options beyond just abortion too, like adoption.", "I would be afraid she needs help from other people. I would feel quilty not helping her, but i can't take care of a kid", "you were unnecessarily horrible to her. your opinion on whether or not she should have a baby is actually irrelevant.", "Seconded, honestly. My mom had me bc she wanted someone to love her unconditionally. She was not fucking ready to be a parent. She'd take me to work with her at her job in a night club. Occasionally, she'd drop me off with one of her friends and fuck off to who knows where for however long. There was never enough money. Our lights and water would get turned off and we've been evicted more times than I can count. Once, we were homeless and slept on a floor of a church. If you're not prepared to make sacrifices and you don't have the money, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't have kids. When I was 16 I told my mom that I was going to spend the night with my grandma. I packed a small bag and left and fucking refused to go home. I refused to ever live with her again. I left so much of my shit at my mom's house, but I couldn't take it anymore. I'm in my 30s now and I still resent the fuck out of my mother. I only talk to her on the phone once a week, and even then, I only do it while high, bc I can't be sober and put up with her shit.\n\nSure, OP's friend could probably raise a kid to adulthood with the lifestyle she currently has. But will the child be happy, healthy and safe? Or will they grow up to feel nothing but anger towards their mother?"]}
