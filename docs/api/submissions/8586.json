Sure you can force feed them plants if you want them to suffer, probably be malnourished and probably get sick and die because they aren\u2019t eating a biologically appropriate meal. especially considering since she jumped down your throat calling her an idiot was nice; there is much more colorful language you could have used; I\u2019d like to know if her parents were siblings or if they dropped her on her head as a child \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 she better be careful an idiot like her could easily fall off that high horse she\u2019s on and hurt herself lol", "NTA - your house, your pets, your expertise, your rules.\n\nShe has the option not to be in your space if she wants, but she doesn\u2019t get to impose unhealthy diets on your animals or to criticise or judge you for the appropriate care you are giving them.", "NTA.\n\nNot every animal can eat some kind of vegan substitute.

I keep 3 breeding pairs of mice specifically to create food for my snake. They live in large, comfortable cages & are well taken care of. I rotate the mating schedule to make sure I don't let the males over-breed the mother mice. \n\nA live mouse gets on the head to render it unconscious before getting dangled into my snake's cage. The unconscious mouse doesn't suffer for more than a moment & my snake gets the healthiest meal that I can provide. I also don't have to worry that the mouse could injure my snake by biting or scratching him during mealtime. \n\n*For the record, I tried using frozen mice. Sadly, my snake refused to cooperate. My vet said that most likely his original owner had never used anything but live food while the snake was a juvenile.*\n\nEdit to add judgement.", "NTA \n\nThe friend wants you to apologize for what exactly? Ensuring your pets are properly fed? If they were in the wild, they'd be eating other animals. That's how nature works. \n\nThe only fake ally here is Sam.

Would be like trying to feed a cat vegetables, their bodies require specific animal proteins to survive.", "At first I thought perhaps she was criticizing with the idea that I was killing the rats myself - which I don't, specifically because I don't have the heart for it & I love rats as pets - but hey if I wasn't comfortable feeding animal products to my pets, I wouldn't keep snakes in the first place.", "Because she can't see the original animal I guess she manages to overlook the sheer hypocrisy going on there", "Cause she seems like one of those idiot people who can't comprehend how a burger is a cow. If it don't look like an animal then it's fine, but she shat her pants cause you had whole animals in the freezer instead of kibble.", "These are the type of people who tell you to buy your meat from a grocery store because it is 'more humane'. They exist. You're definitely NTA in this situation. I would have called her far worse. I'm an Iowa farm girl - I grew up helping my family render our own meat when the opportunity presented itself. I've also worked in a local slaughter house. Processing the meat yourself can definitely be more human than buying from a grocery store that gets their supply from a slaughter house.\n\nNot to say that slaughter houses are intentionally cruel... They just have a very high volume to push out in a very short time. Many of the animals are treated far superior to the humans actually working to process them.\n\nEDIT: at least they are when entering the slaughter house. I can't speak for how they were cared for at the farms where they came from."]}
