It's always been really weird to me.\n\nIn working in pet stores, sometimes we got them to accept frozen-thawed by rubbing rat bedding on them then rubbing it off, but some would only live feed. Which is insanely less than ideal, but sometimes you have to weigh the health of the snake against the humane-ness of the life of the rat, and that's when you truly realize the animal world is not always pretty.\n\nOne thing I absolutely hate is when you see videos online of people harassing a snake that just ate until it pukes out its food (sometimes the prey is still alive, other times it's not) and unless it's eaten a pet, or tried to, there is no reason to mess with a snake that is eating. (With a few exceptions, such as the invasive snakes in Florida from people getting cheap retic/burmese and simply releasing them outside when they get too big as they are killing the local ecosystems.)\n\nA big point being, being an animal lover, sometimes means that some animals are lower in the food chain, some animals, no matter how much you love them, may have others of their kind that are prey. I've had friends who had pet mice, but also had snakes and fed frozen-thawed to their snakes. Because they knew the difference in what is your pet and what is food for another. We humans can pick if we eat meat or other things for nutrition, animals don't as they are not built that way.\n\nThere are also times understanding maintaining an eco-system and being an animal lover can conflict. You can hate hunting, you can hate the killing of any animal, but as far as maintaining an eco-system goes, sometimes overpopulation happens. Hunting/culling in those situations is required because if you don't, the eco-system will collapse. As humans have removed a lot of the predator animals in some areas, it can lead to things like deer over population and if they were left unchecked, they would run out of food and they would end up starving and suffering.", "I have to feed my dog Wild Boar and another annoying protein because he is allergic to everything (basically life at this point).

PETA\u2019s official position is animals are better off dead than in captivity in any capacity. Even the ones that\u2019d die without humans because we\u2019ve messed with them, like hair sheep. NTA", "NTA. This would have angered me so much. I genuinely genuinely detest people like these who think that they can give vegan substitutes to carnivores.", "NTAH, she is an idiot. You're providing the nutrients they need. Abuse is altering an animal's diet to fit inside your belief system. Nature is beautiful, and it is ugly.", "NTA \n\nShe has the option to choose what she eats and doesn\u2019t but she doesn\u2019t get to choose what carnivorous or omnivorous animals eat - that\u2019s just hubris to think that a snake has to comply w her morals", "NTA. You called a spade a spade. She's probably the kind of idiot that would feed a cat a vegan diet.", "She didn't even ask if there WAS an artificial plant-based substitute available. People need to know their shit before they get all righteous about it.", "Wait till she finds out what the cats eat", "NTA. Being \u201cvery passionate about animals\u201d must be secret code word for idiot.", "NTA, she knows nothing about actual animal husbandry. She\u2019s passionate about the idea of animals, not reality", "NTA I\u2019m vegan and she needs to do some research about animals and their natural diets if she\u2019s so passionate", "NTA.\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for, your assessment is 100% accurate.", "NTA\n\nShe does sound like an idiot. OP have nothing to apologise for", "I agree she\u2019s an idiot. But gassing an animal is not actually more humane as they suffocate and are very much alive and visibly/audibly distressed while they actively suffocate. Apparently cervical dislocation is the most humane for rats. Though I\u2019m no expert. I just know from videos that gassing any animal is far from humane.", "Plus taking the predators out of the ecosystem tends to result in to many prey animals which can really screw up the ecosystem. The example that often gets bought up is that reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone (after they were wiped out by humans) has significantly helped the biodiversity there by preventing other species from overgrazing.", "I laughed out loud reading this \ud83d\ude02", "It's also why people who legitimately value the environment/ecosystem/animals still support hunting seasons in specific areas. \n\nFor instance, in the Northeast USA, there's deer hunting season. This is vital for the ecosystem because we chased off/killed all of their natural predators (wolves, coyotes, mountain lions, bears). But the deer remained. And if their numbers are left unchecked, the deer population will rapidly destroy both themselves and the entire ecosystem.\n\nIt sounds inhumane. But it is objectively necessary for *something* to hunt and kill the deer regularly, for the sake of the deer as well as every other organism in the deers' ecosystems.", "That\u2019s not a vegan thing, that\u2019s a neglectful parent thing. The journalists who are employed by news corporations funded by animal agriculture love to highlight when a vegan family is neglectful by painting it as all vegans do this. But there\u2019s no \u201cmeat eating parents kills baby by feeding only xyz\u201d headlines it\u2019s just \u201cneglectful parents starve baby\u201d.", "Have looked into this. I had my friend send me pics of what she feeds her pets, as I too was concerned that she may be forcing an unhealthy diet on them. Confirmed she does feed them regular pet food from the cold section of the pet produce, so I guess it's just my pets that should suffer /s", "\"news corporations funded by animal agriculture\".  Okay crazy, lol.", "This is actually an issue of pretty significant contention among reptile keepers where I live. It is against the law to live feed here, as well as the dangers to the reptile of live feeding - however some reptiles are just very fussy. The only keepers I have ever heard of that have had animals that only live feed very much keep it on the down low.", "Fun fact, did you know cats can eat meat baby food? They love it. We had to resort to that with added vitamin supplements for our one cat that was having issues with grain.", "It\u2019s true. Some of the biggest advertisers are the meat, egg and dairy industries therefore news agencies are funded by animal agriculture. Doesn\u2019t take a genius to work that out"]}
