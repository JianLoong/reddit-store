A lot of ppl are vegan for lots of different reasons, and even those that are vegan bc they're against animal cruelty and consumption can be understanding of other ppl who participate in that. You can't know beforehand how a vegan is going to react to that-everyone's going to have their own values/boundadies/etc. \n\nAlso, if the friend knew what kind of pets OP had beforehand, she shouldn't be surprised about what OP feeds them. You can't claim to be an animal lover when you 1.) can't acknowledge that many animals are omnivores or herbivores, and 2.) genuinely believe animals that eat meat to survive can live on a plant-based diet.", "An animal lover and animal rights advocate should understand that some animals feed on other animals. \nThe vegan's idea of the snakes diet would harm the snake.", "Horses will slurp up baby chickens pretty damn quick if they can get them.", "Wouldn't they be omnivores then?

Obviously NTA and no you don\u2019t owe this offensively ignorant woman an apology.", "It isn't any different. You're NTA and truly, she is an idiot. I've always said that the reason I can't have a snake is because I'd have trouble feeding it live animals. Your solution is extremely humane and responsible. What does she expect you to feed them? Snake pellets? \ud83d\ude02", "Love that you took in a lot of those not so popular animals. Even if there are reptiles, that have mixed diet (bearded dragons, green iguanas) they still need their crickets. But for plant based.

They need animal proteins *and most can't even digest plants that contain protein like humans can*, and will lose muscle mass.

One cow may \"feed many humans\", but we still kill tons and tons of cows every day to feed humans. And the treatment of cows on the industrial level is pretty inhumane. It sounds like these rats at least are not tortured the way cows are. If you're feeding a carnivore, some other must die; ironically, humans are omnivores so we aren't really killing cows because we would die without meat the way a carnivore would, we just do it because it tastes good.
