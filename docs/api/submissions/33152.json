It will be hard because obviously your brother is dealing with alot but that shouldn\u2019t take away from your joy.\n\nEDIT: And should have included congrats \ud83c\udf89wishing you an awesome new year!", "NAH. Life's rocky and I feel for your brother but that should not change your plans at all. Hopefully your brother will find in himself to be able happy for you despite his situation.", "NTA. If you want to give your brother a head\u2019s up, that might be nice but not at all necessary. And congratulations!!! That sounds like a very romantic way to propose!!", "YWNBTA. Your life doesn\u2019t revolve around your brother\u2019s life! You proposing to your girlfriend shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him. You can give him a heads up if you feel the need to, especially if he\u2019ll be attending this proposal, but you shouldn\u2019t put your plans on hold because of what\u2019s going on in his marriage/life. \n\nGood luck! I hope she says yes!!", "Nah you're chill. Hope she says yes!", "NTA\n\nJust take the time maybe to mention it to him and that you had this all planned out.", "NTA,\n\n\nCongratulations! Also, congratulations on having your guest list reduced by one.", "NAH\n\nNobody is asking you to stop living. Your bro gave you a heads up. Return the courtesy, but live your life.", "Life goes on. Nta-that said, it might be something think about as to what you plan around your bro (like you can\u2019t blame him for being a downer if you make him best man or MC, or along those lines). I would check with him to see how he would like to be included for wedding stuff (ya never know, maybe he\u2019ll handle it like a champ)", "Being a good bro is being aware and sensitive to what your bother\u2019s going through right now.

You shouldn't let your brother pull you down from marring someone you really do love.", "The divorce, as sad as that is, is your brother's life. Not yours.

I don't even understand what one thing has to do with the other.", "ywnbta at all! you can't put your life on hold , every time there will be some else in someone else's life going on. you gotta live your own life!
