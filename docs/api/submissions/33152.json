It will be hard because obviously your brother is dealing with alot but that shouldn\u2019t take away from your joy.\n\nEDIT: And should have included congrats \ud83c\udf89wishing you an awesome new year!", "NAH. Life's rocky and I feel for your brother but that should not change your plans at all. Hopefully your brother will find in himself to be able happy for you despite his situation.", "NTA. If you want to give your brother a head\u2019s up, that might be nice but not at all necessary. And congratulations!!! That sounds like a very romantic way to propose!!", "YWNBTA. Your life doesn\u2019t revolve around your brother\u2019s life! You proposing to your girlfriend shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him. You can give him a heads up if you feel the need to, especially if he\u2019ll be attending this proposal, but you shouldn\u2019t put your plans on hold because of what\u2019s going on in his marriage/life. \n\nGood luck! I hope she says yes!!", "Nah you're chill. Hope she says yes!", "NTA\n\nJust take the time maybe to mention it to him and that you had this all planned out.", "NTA,\n\n\nCongratulations! Also, congratulations on having your guest list reduced by one.", "NAH\n\nNobody is asking you to stop living. Your bro gave you a heads up. Return the courtesy, but live your life.", "Life goes on. Nta-that said, it might be something think about as to what you plan around your bro (like you can\u2019t blame him for being a downer if you make him best man or MC, or along those lines). I would check with him to see how he would like to be included for wedding stuff (ya never know, maybe he\u2019ll handle it like a champ)", "Being a good bro is being aware and sensitive to what your bother\u2019s going through right now.  How would you feel if the roles were reversed and you were the one going through the divorce?", "You wouldn't if you have been planing this then you should! You shouldn't let your brother pull you down from marring someone you really do love.", "The divorce, as sad as that is, is your brother's life. Not yours. Propose to her if you're ready for that step in the relationship. YWNBTA", "YWNBTA, but maybe consider giving him a heads up ahead of time?", "YWNBTA\n\nYou can\u2019t stop living your life bc of things going on with other people.\n\nCongrats!", "Being a good bro is being aware and sensitive to what your bother\u2019s going through right now.  How would you feel if the roles were reversed and you were the one going through the divorce?", "YWNBTAH. However, as a brother, I would give him a heads up. Don't need to ask him permission, but if you give him the courtesy of letting him know personally ahead of time, he can react graciously in front of the rest of the family.", "Life keeps happening no matter what is going on in your life, or anybody else's life. You can't put yours on hold to make others happy. Have your proposal and enjoy the moment. NTA", "Have you asked him if he'd have a problem with it? You're NTA either way but giving him a heads up would be kind, especially if he's going to be there too.", "NTA. I don't even understand what one thing has to do with the other.", "ywnbta at all! you can't put your life on hold , every time there will be some else in someone else's life going on. you gotta live your own life! Congrats!", "This \u261d\ufe0f\n\nGreat response", "This is the answer\n\nNTA", "\ud83e\udd23 thanks", "NTA.  You don\u2019t have to put your life on hold because of your brothers situation.  Definitely let him know what\u2019s going on but you don\u2019t have to change anything and it\u2019s not rude to move forward with your plan.  Honestly, just be courteous of how he\u2019s feeling and don\u2019t shove the fact you\u2019re getting married in his face every chance you get like many couples do.", "NTA", "NTA Just give him a heads up, and if you were planning on including families in the proposal, check if he would be comfortable with it.", "Your proposal would likely be a welcome distraction for your brother. I would bet that he\u2019d love to see you happy and ready for the next phase of your life. NTA but you are, indeed a very  thoughtful and considerate brother. Your bride is lucky to have you.", "No. Nta", "NTA. You may want to give him a heads up privately to give him time to process as another commenter suggested. I also assume you aren't planning on him being there during the proposal. Good luck!", "NTA. Your life doesn't change because he is having the natural end of his relationship. You can still be sensitive. I mean, don't do it at his party, or in front of him, or any thoughtless crap like that. But if it is just you and your girlfriend at a party somewhere, go for it.", "Your bother\u2019s marital breakdown has nothing to do with your hopes to marry your girlfriend and vice versa. You absolutely would not be TA if you propose to your girlfriend on NYE. The only slightly uncouth thing would be to propose to her in front of your brother but I assume you\u2019re not doing that. Good luck, hope she says yes!", "No, NTA\n\nHis life might have taken a wrong turning but that\u2019s separate from yours. Do you think that you shouldn\u2019t ever get engaged because he\u2019s unmarrying?\n\nJust don\u2019t propose as a spectator sport. Do it privately without an audience.", "Life goes on, talk to your brother see what he thinks but you need to get on either your life. PS tell your brother not to move out. Live separately in the same house otherwise the divorce will fuck him.", "Don\u2019t do it in front of him. Tell him privately maybe even via text so he can react privately that you\u2019re going to be proposing and you just wanted to let him know.", "NTA\n\nYour life doesn't have to be put on hold for his", "NTA\n\nI would tell your brother your plans. But also tell him you will support him through his divorce. The world won't stop cause he's getting divorced, and a good brother will still support your marriage (especially if it's just a formality at this point).", "NTA. I\u2019m in the midst of planning my wedding, meanwhile my sister is going through a divorce. But, on top of that, she is a photographer and will be the photographer for my wedding\u2026again, while she\u2019s going through a divorce. \n\nFor the record, she offered (I was going to ask but she offered first). She\u2019s able to separate her own experience from mine and is able to just be happy for me. I would hope your brother could do the same.", "I would go on as planned. His problem should not affect your plans .", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your brother but you can\u2019t pause your life for others.", "No", "Why should you put your future on hold because your brother's marriage is crumbling down? If you put everything on hold for others you will never get to live the life you want. Don't put your plans on hold because of your brother's failing marriage. You're not the AH. If he gets upset with you and isn't excited for you then he is the AH for being selfish.", "NTA. I don't see what one has to do with the other. His divorce has been coming for a long time. Don't put your life on hold, but don't expect much from him in the way of interest or support. He's in a very different place.", "NTA\n\nHis life issues are not a reason to postpone your plans. Maybe give him a private heads up and don't spring the news on him where your partner is going to hear his reaction.", "No you can\u2019t put you life or happiness on hold because he going through a divorce", "NTA, and I don't think your brother should even be worried. We all have our own lives, and yours is not put on hold for something that is really not related. I wouln't be upset if my brother got a new car while mine was in the shop.\n\n\nAnd I encourage you to not listen to anyone who says to tell him privately or give him a heads up beforehand. He likely doesn't want to even think anymore about what he is going through, let alone feel like some sort of charity case that needs to be handled with kid's gloves. Do your thing without making his scenario an issue. Otherwise, you are likely to hurt his feelings.", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you wait for THAT kind of thing, you will never have a life.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m going through a divorce right now. My sister and her boyfriend are going to get engaged any minute now.\n\nDespite the pain my wayward spouse is causing me, I\u2019m not going to let it take away from my joy at my sister finding her lobster. I helped design the ring, I\u2019ll be one of the first people she calls, and I\u2019m going to be so f**king happy for her.", "As long as you don\u2019t do it in front of your brother, NAH. It sucks he\u2019s going through a rough time but life goes on for other people.", "WNBTA\n\nYou should not have to put your life on hold because your brother has held onto a woman who's hated him for years.  \n\nTho you can low key stuff around him for awhile just to be \"sensitive\" to his feelings.", "Not sure if this is AITA territory - is there any existing conflict to judge or do you just want advice???", "100000% this and NTA", "I spent too much time in Trinidad and now MC means something different to me.", "This! NTA for me UNLESS he\u2019ll actually be witnessing it. If it\u2019s just private and he\u2019ll find out later with the rest of the family, it\u2019s fine.", "Would you feel guilty if someone planned something then delayed their own happiness because of you?", "Master of Ceremonies or Mc Donalds?", "Although a private heads up for the brother in case he needs to process complex emotions before he can be happy for OP would be nice.", "Who said anything about a delay?  Just don\u2019t do it front of your bro!", "Op never said they would propose in front of their brother. Even if they did, i\u2019d hope their brother is mature enough to realize that other relationships exist even when his is going poorly"]}
