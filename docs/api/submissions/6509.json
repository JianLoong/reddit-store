She and Nico both offered to pay for me to go so I thought explaining the situation to her would make her understand it wasn\u2019t because of her or because of the money. That backfired because she told her family who are now upset with Nico\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nHis girlfriend is accusing me of doing this intentionally to turn Nico\u2019s family against her which wasn\u2019t my intention.

This might be kind of relevant.", "This post seems to have a lot of missing reasons. Both your ex bf and Nico's current gf were concerned about you and Nico's closeness but you don't want to tell us exactly why, which leads me to think you are the AH.", "You\u2019ve intentionally made this about you. Multiple people are uncomfortable about your relationship with Nico, and I feel like you\u2019re intentionally leaving information out regarding that.

I also don't blame Nico's sister for getting upset at you for not coming because I think you should've thought about this more instead of making it about you, Nico, and his long-term gf because that day was about his sister. Bit of a tactless judgement made on your part imo, which with more context might make me change to Y T A. There seems to be missing pieces of history between all of you, and it doesn't make sense how you would vehemently not want to go to this event just because one person is slightly inconvenienced by you being there.\n\nETA: Because of OP's comments in the thread, I'm switching to YTA. She very much made this about her.", "YTA. You absolutely threw Nico's gf under the bus there. Neither Nico or his gf had told you not to go; this was 100% your choice. There was no need to mention Nico's gf to the sister. Either go and support your friend, or don't go, all fine. But dropping someone else in it isn't fair.", "YTA.\n\n1. It's not your place to judge \"what might happen.\"  You should ask questions and get clarity with all in involved.\n2. There are multiple people bothered over your relationship with Nico.  That should tell you something.  I suspect you two are not acting as \"friends\" and acting as more than that.  People on the outside know the difference.\n3. Combining the two, you knew this would cause a problem. Your wording in telling Nico's sister why you weren't going wasn't flattering to Nico's girlfriend.  Why else would they be upset with Nico's girlfriend?", "So there's not one, but two people who apparently are made uncomfortable with how friendly you and Nico are with each other... \n\nAnd you chose THIS precise moment to acknowledge and respect that?\n\nAs opposed to the... who knows how long ago that those people expressed themselves?\n\nI gotta be honest it's *really* hard to interpret that as anything other than you choosing your timing rather carefully to make things about you and stirring up drama overseas. \n\nAll while you can comfortable sit far, far away from the actual fallout you've caused. Rather convenient it seems. \n\nI'm not saying that's what you're doing but I can certainly see why others think it is.   \n\n\nThere *has* to be details about the relationship between you and Nico that you are leaving out, and I've seen several other commenters ask about them while you ignore and evade. Hard to pass judgement without knowing more of this situation and what's really going on but you're not painting a very flattering self portrait dear.", "YTA. Nico\u2019s sister is the one getting married, and you shouldn\u2019t punish her and her spouse-to-be for something that her brother\u2019s girlfriend did. You\u2019re free not to go to the wedding, but it still makes you TA. You wouldn\u2019t be TA if you hadn\u2019t told Nico and her girlfriend the reason why you didn\u2019t want to go, and instead said that you\u2019re afraid of flying or something like that.", "YTA.\n\nYou should have just gone to the fing wedding. Next time don't overthink like this.", "I mean\u2026 You could have spoken to Nico about this first. Whether it was intentional or not, you kind of blindsided your friend here. If I was Nico, I\u2019d be upset that my lifelong friend hadn\u2019t bothered to tell me what was going on. \n\nI think YTA for that oversight alone.", "Sounds like someone likes drama. If this was really about Nico and his relationship then you know telling his family that Nicos GF was the reason you weren't going wasn't going to end well for Nicos GF. I highly doubt you didn't know that was going to happen.", "im going against the grain with NTA. the bride who asked why OP couldn\u2019t go to the wedding was told im not going because my best friends girlfriend asked me not to out of respect for their relationship. the closeness is immaterial and the need to put distance is immaterial to the actual issue. someone who was not throwing an event uninvited someone they had no right to exclude. so OP was supposed to lie as to why she wasnt coming to save face for Nicos girlfriend who couldnt be bothered to tell her own boyfriend that she didnt want his best friend at the wedding? yeah his sister is going to be mad that crossed massive boundaries for his sister who has a right to be pissed.", "YTA but also INFO\n\nsooo since your bf broke up with you over nico are you hoping this is finally your chance to snag him by causing drama and making his family hate his gf?\n\nAre you hoping that by saying welll it's her fault im not coming would make him break up with her so you can finally profess your love for him??\n\nGirl  your bf broke up with you over Nico. You say he thought yall were too close and you always took his side but I feel like you're downplaying a lot here.", "NTA. You tried to do what is right by the family by making sure everyone is comfortable. Sure, you should have gone to the wedding anyway because you are there to support your friend, not Nico and his girlfriend. However, Nico and everyone else deserves to know what a nasty person the girlfriend is before she joins the family.", "If your genuine intention was pure hearted then NAH but I honestly doubt that\u2019s the case. I feel it\u2019s pretty obvious that that would have ended up backfiring into the gf\u2019s face. This seems almost planned as a way to get the family to dislike the gf and intentionally create drama.", "NTA but I don't understand why you should distance yourself from him. Unless he himself come and tell you he doesn't want to be your friend anymore, why should you distance from him? It's your friendship and, as long as it's just that, no one else has the right to interfere.", "You were supposed to be there for ur friend, not the gf. Gf needs to own up to what she said. Never say anything in the dark that you can't own up to in the light. If this is the case, she said what she said and just has to own it.", "ESH\n\nYou must be either very young or very na\u00efve to not have known how this would blow back on you, and on Nico and his family.\n\nBut also, Nico's GF sounds like a piece of work; if she's 1) giving ultimatums 2) because she's insecure about the friendship between the two of you, then he's probably better off without her and I hope he does the right thing by kicking her to the curb.\n\nIn the future, please try to be more tactful about interpersonal conflict.", "NTA Once again this week, I don't get all the Y T As. You only told them the truth. Why does \"his girlfriend wants me to stay away from him\" need to be a secret? Why were you obligated to keep that a secret from everybody for her? It's absurd to exoect you wouldn't or shouldn't tell anybody that. It's not confidential.\n\nI also can't believe people are blaming YOU for your boyfriend trying to forbid you from keeping your male friends! He's not the first to do that, and that's never defensible!\n\nI'm seeing so much victim blaming in this thread, and I'm sorry you're dealing with it. You had every right to refuse a partner's ultimatum to drop friendships, you had every right to turn down an invitation, and you had every right to tell people your friend's girlfriend wants you to stay away from him.", "nta, nico and his sister and family sure are.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
