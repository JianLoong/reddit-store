It was a small problem that bubbled over, not a \"real\" issue. \n\nFor people out there with ADHD partners - especially guys with ADHD girlfriends and wives - I learned two things that could help you in the future.\n\n1: rejection sensitivity is a common symptom of ADHD, especially in women. It stings extra when someone tells you \"no\". That's why I got a big reaction from my wife. I didn't feel like I was \"rejecting\" her, only setting a boundary, but she felt differently, and her feelings matter to me.\n\n2: lots of people with ADHD have been told their entire lives that they are too much. and that they should take it down a notch. This is true of my wife, who has a very big personality. Hearing me ask her to control her wrist buzzes seemed a lot to her like I was telling her to be smaller, to shut up. \n\nThose two things combined created hard feelings on her end. There was always going to be some conflict when I set that boundary, but I could've been more sensitive, and she could've been more communicative and understanding.\n\nThese are the travails of marraige. It was a little speed bump and we got over it.

I felt really sad for your wife when you told her you weren't interested in hearing about the things going on in her life. Sometimes my bf and I will send multiple paragraphs to the other during the day about something. It's not demanding attention, we just wish we could be in the same room talking like normal but we can't bc work so we just shoot each other texts. Then we read them and respond when we have time to. I would **NEVER** even think about asking them to not tell me about their day and I would NEVER act like their messages were dismissable and permanently mute them. I actually like hearing about the person I love's life and I hope you learn to appreciate the fact that your wife wants to share her life with you.", "Overhelping and excessive caretaking should be avoided. You need to set real boundaries as it relates to her disordered thinking. You aren't a coping mechanism. You aren't a reassurance machine. Don't infantilize your GF. She needs to give you space while she learns to deal with trivialities on her own. Sometimes a person's desire to feel needed will lead directly to an unhealthy dependence and eventually resentment in both sides.", "she is allowed to have feelings, too, and she was fine once we talked it out. it just needed talking.", "Yeah I\u2019m sure you know what\u2019s best for his marriage and this situation that he\u2019s already resolved", "Just because we can be in constant contact with our partners doesn't mean we should. There's no reason to share the trivialities of your day as they happen. Not every thought nor interaction needs to be shared with our person. You can try writing some of your thoughts down to share with each other when you're physically together. I think it is likely that you find that much of what you write down is of little importance and no more than a fleeting thought. \n\nIt's a mistake to treat a marriage like a 15 year old treats an online discord dalliance. Intimacy is related to the quality of communication rather than the volume.", "I never needed to learn that fact! I love my wife and the time we spend together. It was just the wrist buzzing that was the problem. We worked that one little thing out, and now I have a better appreciation of how she processed that conversation. Onwards!"]}
