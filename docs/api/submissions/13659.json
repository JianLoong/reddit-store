It was a small problem that bubbled over, not a \"real\" issue. \n\nFor people out there with ADHD partners - especially guys with ADHD girlfriends and wives - I learned two things that could help you in the future.\n\n1: rejection sensitivity is a common symptom of ADHD, especially in women. It stings extra when someone tells you \"no\". That's why I got a big reaction from my wife. I didn't feel like I was \"rejecting\" her, only setting a boundary, but she felt differently, and her feelings matter to me.\n\n2: lots of people with ADHD have been told their entire lives that they are too much. and that they should take it down a notch. This is true of my wife, who has a very big personality. Hearing me ask her to control her wrist buzzes seemed a lot to her like I was telling her to be smaller, to shut up. \n\nThose two things combined created hard feelings on her end. There was always going to be some conflict when I set that boundary, but I could've been more sensitive, and she could've been more communicative and understanding.\n\nThese are the travails of marraige. It was a little speed bump and we got over it.

I felt really sad for your wife when you told her you weren't interested in hearing about the things going on in her life. Sometimes my bf and I will send multiple paragraphs to the other during the day about something. It's not demanding attention, we just wish we could be in the same room talking like normal but we can't bc work so we just shoot each other texts. Then we read them and respond when we have time to. I would **NEVER** even think about asking them to not tell me about their day and I would NEVER act like their messages were dismissable and permanently mute them. I actually like hearing about the person I love's life and I hope you learn to appreciate the fact that your wife wants to share her life with you.", "Overhelping and excessive caretaking should be avoided. You need to set real boundaries as it relates to her disordered thinking. You aren't a coping mechanism. You aren't a reassurance machine. Don't infantilize your GF. She needs to give you space while she learns to deal with trivialities on her own. Sometimes a person's desire to feel needed will lead directly to an unhealthy dependence and eventually resentment in both sides.", "she is allowed to have feelings, too, and she was fine once we talked it out. it just needed talking.", "Yeah I\u2019m sure you know what\u2019s best for his marriage and this situation that he\u2019s already resolved", "Just because we can be in constant contact with our partners doesn't mean we should. There's no reason to share the trivialities of your day as they happen. Not every thought nor interaction needs to be shared with our person. You can try writing some of your thoughts down to share with each other when you're physically together. I think it is likely that you find that much of what you write down is of little importance and no more than a fleeting thought. \n\nIt's a mistake to treat a marriage like a 15 year old treats an online discord dalliance. Intimacy is related to the quality of communication rather than the volume.", "I never needed to learn that fact! I love my wife and the time we spend together. It was just the wrist buzzing that was the problem. We worked that one little thing out, and now I have a better appreciation of how she processed that conversation. Onwards!", "i have adhd and do the same thing as your wife often, but i also get easily distracted and annoyed by notifications when i'm trying to focus. so my recommendation is using Do Not Disturb (works on your phone and watch). i recently realized that you can tailor exactly which notifications come through, which is super helpful! also, good job to you guys on communicating effectively and empathizing to find a solution that works for you both.", "I just read the original now and, uh... You sure have a very low tolerance for a random thing (alerts) for someone purported to be neurotypical... Just a thought.\n\nBut super glad y'all talked it out successfully! Yay for adult interaction, still undefeated!", "Do you both have iPhones? If you have your phone/watch set to do not disturb when your wife sends you an iMessage she will have the option to \"notify anyway\" for urgent messages, but otherwise can send as many messages as she wants without the notifications coming thru. You can also make a \"personal\" do not disturb setting to allow just her notifications through, or just the app that you use to text her with, as a symbolic gesture - and tell her you'll use that mode at times when an excitement fueled slip up of the \"one text\" rule might be less irritating than other times.", "I text my boyfriend all of the time. He has me (and everyone) on a constant mute. This means I can text him to my hearts content, and I know it won't disturb him, and that he'll check his phone and answer often. Just like OP does. It doesn't make me less special, it doesn't mean he's mot interested in what's going on in my life, in fact it just means he sets the appropriate parameters for him to be able to make me welcome at any time I want, and it's pretty great. Muting someone doesn't mean not caring, and nowhere in this post does it sound like OP doesn't care.", "To some of us it does feel like a demand, nothing anyone says will make it FEEL different to me, I much rather have the face to face conversation once we are both home, i want to listen, but not through multiple texts during the day\n\nI hope you learn to appreciate that people have different needs and feelings and that both sides are equally valid, because you sounded quite condescending to OP", "the *immediacy* is what gets me with the apple watch. I can and do ignore my phone but my watch is just all up in my goddamn grill!", "This is the answer to so many conflicts; I\u2019m glad the two of you got it sorted out!", "Man, I bet you\u2019re going to get a lot of \u201cbut NTA! Set boundaries!\u201d replies here, but as a woman with ADHD, I have to say what I appreciate is your understanding of and sensitivity toward your wife. Sometimes no one has done anything \u201cwrong\u201d and there\u2019s miscommunication or assumptions or just years of baggage that make something really hit a sore spot. Being able to talk about that last one with empathy is so key. She\u2019s lucky to have you.", "I married a whole-ass woman, not just the parts of her that are \"easy\". \n\nI'm sure I drive her a lil nuts in various ways too!", "Right!! I'm definitely used to being told to shut up regularly as an ADHD person and RSD does like to tell me no one wants to hear me.", ">I married a whole-ass woman, not just the parts of her that are \"easy\".\n\nMan, the number of husbands that feature on this sub that need this on a piece of paper stapled to their foreheads...you're one of the good ones!", "\"...and her feelings matter to me.\"\n\nLove this.", "I struggle with ADHD and I always send a lot of texts at once. I'm not doing it intentionally, but sometimes I forget to send information that is important to the text.", "I mean I have ADHD too but just because we're different doesn't give us the right to overstep people's boundaries and/or annoy the hell out of them.\n\nI am glad you both worked it out and I hope for your relatively good communication to keep on going!", "As a women with ADHD, I just want to say you are exactly the type of partner she needs. Thank you for setting clear boundaries, and thank you for being understanding of her rejection sensitive dysphoria. I hope she treats you with the same level of respect and accommodation!", "Woohoo! I remember the original post. So happy to hear y\u2019all worked it out. Very eye opening with the adhd realizations too!", "Communication saves the day! I'm glad to hear for both you and your wife that you're both communicative and want understand each other.\n\nI'm so glad that you learned those two big facts! I never had a partner understand the being made to feel small thing until I met my husband because he also has ADHD.", "She should try writing all of her messages out on her phone in a note app when she wants to buzz you multiple times. This will often deliver the same dopamine hit as actually sending you the message but it\u2019ll let her come back to her thoughts and decide which ones are important enough to share.", "she is my wife, I want to have functionally zero boundaries with her!", "But they clearly like doing it", "Totally agreed. He says it made her feel special to be the one that he gets notified of\u2026well, that\u2019s a privilege that she needs to treat as such. If she just HAS to share the latest gossip then she can send it via a method that doesn\u2019t notify him immediately, like an actual text instead of the designated app. And/or learn to use paragraph breaks instead of sending multiple texts.", "alas, she is a greenbubble", "The app already is the exception to his no notifications rule and she didn\u2019t respect it.", "I'm a woman with ADHD and my partner decided to cut down on how often he used WhatsApp. We don't live together and it really upset me to know he wouldn't be replying to any messages until x time. Of course, anytime anything popped into my head I'd message him straight away because I'd forget to tell him about it later. I didn't pressure him to check messages and I didn't tell him how upset it made me. \n\nHonestly, if I was your wife and you set this boundary with the explanation and umderstanding you've given in your update, I would just feel loved.", "Just turn off notifications. How hard is that?", "While I can respect that, it's kind of impossible to not have boundaries. But that might be my autistic black and white thinking and you not actually trying ro be literal. Because when you say have \"no boundaries\" it sounds like \"oh I wouldn't care if you didn't ever clean up after yourself\" or \"oh go ahead and have sex with other people, I don't care\" or basically her doing things that bother you or possibly hurt your feelings.\n\nBut I think I get the gist of what you mean and I'm just taking it too literally.", "You have to have boundaries with everyone, that is how relationships with anyone works.", "You have to have boundaries in every relationship. It really sounds like you baby your wife.", "LOL. Same here. I have ADHD also and am guilty of the rapid fire texts :/ I\u2019ve always done that though and no one\u2019s ever said anything. I\u2019m now thinking if I should change that, haha. Everyone knows I\u2019m just random hahahaha", "If you don't mind sharing, what was the solution you came up with? \n\nAlso, I'm so happy to read this update :)", "Every comment you make demonstrates what a loser you are IRL.", "Ok well that\u2019s the real problem \ud83d\ude02", "I'm the exact opposite. My phone is permanently on silent while my watch is all that I get notifications on. I WANT to know about it immediately but can ignore it easier on the watch rather than the phone. \ud83e\udd23", "Woman w/ ADHD (married to Man w/ ADHD lawl) here to second this x1000! Ah, the feeling of being too much, everywhere, all the time. It\u2019s validating to read others\u2019 experiences, and I hope your wife knows she\u2019s not alone. \n\nOP, you and your wife are (and will continue to be, I believe) awesome for each other. Thanks for sharing your story, and best wishes for your future.", "she IS loved!!!", "yeah, it's fine, just tiny semantics! I do have \"boundaries\", its just that I have as few as possible with her.", "well, if this is what you consider \"babying\", and if she is fine with this resolution, then okay.", "honestly, it is so dumb simple. \n\nwe moved the \"us\" app (Google Chat) to her second screen and moved the app we use with everyone (Signal) to her home screen. \n\nshe can still access my wrist, but she has to think about it for an extra quarter second. It has solved 100% of the problem.", "Maybe this is one of those things where I shouldn\u2019t be super complimentary because you\u2019re \u201cjust\u201d doing it right. Like when people fawn over dads for taking their kid to the playground, you know?\n\nBut fuck it. Your attitude is A+ and I try to cultivate the same mindset in my relationship. \n\nAnd I do think it\u2019s a little harder to have that attitude when your partner is neurodivergent and you\u2019re not. So thanks for the wholesome and nuanced take.", "where's the xkcd hyphen bot when you need it?", "Thank you for the clarification! \ud83d\ude05 I'm still learning / improving my own social skills and trying to learn not to take things literally all the time. You seem like a very kind and understanding person. Not many neurodivergent people are lucky to have people like that in their lives. Thank you for being willing to learn and understand people who are different. Your wife is very lucky.", "You and your wife came to a satisfactory conclusion. Good for you! I do not see this as you babying your wife.", "As long as you're good with walking on egg shells and letting ADHD be the excuse for it all then good for you. None of my nevermind what others do in their relationship.", "My partner is a lot like you, OP. I have ADHD too, but only got a formal diagnosis last year. A few weeks after I noticed that he seemed to understand a lot more about how my brain was functioning. So if I got overstimulated or had what would seem to most as an overreaction, he would ask, \u201cis your brain telling you I don\u2019t love you? Because I do love you and I will always love you.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long to realize he\u2019s done a bunch of research and reading about being a partner to someone with ADHD and how it makes their brain work. It\u2019s a beautiful thing that you\u2019ve done the same. \n\nPeople saying she should respect the boundary and that you shouldn\u2019t accommodate\u2026 it\u2019s wonderful that you are accommodating her as much as you can. And to those people I ask- when was the last time you fought your brain and won? It is incredibly difficult to fight with your own brain, and requires a lot of training on how to do it. It\u2019s not as straightforward as you\u2019d like to think. For instance, right now stress is exacerbating my trichotillomania, which is telling me to rip out my hair. I have been fighting it for weeks but I still have a bald spot. For the foreseeable future I will be wearing a hat all day every day (and a bonnet at night) because if I can easily get to my hair I will tear it out. I can\u2019t control it. I wish I could. The hat makes an extra step and since it isn\u2019t hair it\u2019s much easier to tell my hands not to mess with it. \n\nMore people need partners like you. I\u2019m really glad the two of you were able to work through it and find a way to set the boundary while still allowing her to feel like she is loved just as she is. It\u2019s an important thing to us neurodivergent folks.\n\nSo yay for you!", "she's worth it \ud83e\udd70", ">when was the last time you fought your brain and won?\n\nwow talk about an armor-piercing question! My partner and I are actually both on the waitlist for an ADHD assessment but it seems a dead cert we both have it - his is more hyperactive, mine is definitely inattentive plus I'm also autistic. So we're at cross purposes with each other a lot of the time and it's definitely gotten way worse since we had covid. My RSD was always pretty bad and he tends to shoot from the hip without thinking about how his words come across if he's stressed (and therefore under increased brainload). Not a good combo\n\neta (bc adhd brain means never getting it all in first go): I feel you on the trichotillomania. I actually started tweezing my leg hairs and pulling out pubic hair so as not to create a bald spot on my head or a gap in my eyelashes (i have a couple and I know that with sjogren's syndrome my eyes need all the protection they can get from dust!)", "thank you!"]}
