It was a small problem that bubbled over, not a \"real\" issue. \n\nFor people out there with ADHD partners - especially guys with ADHD girlfriends and wives - I learned two things that could help you in the future.\n\n1: rejection sensitivity is a common symptom of ADHD, especially in women. It stings extra when someone tells you \"no\". That's why I got a big reaction from my wife. I didn't feel like I was \"rejecting\" her, only setting a boundary, but she felt differently, and her feelings matter to me.\n\n2: lots of people with ADHD have been told their entire lives that they are too much. and that they should take it down a notch. This is true of my wife, who has a very big personality. Hearing me ask her to control her wrist buzzes seemed a lot to her like I was telling her to be smaller, to shut up. \n\nThose two things combined created hard feelings on her end. There was always going to be some conflict when I set that boundary, but I could've been more sensitive, and she could've been more communicative and understanding.\n\nThese are the travails of marraige. It was a little speed bump and we got over it. Thanks to all the commenters!\n\neta: this was the solution\n\n>honestly, it is so dumb simple. \n\n>we moved the \"us\" app (Google Chat) to her second screen and moved the app we use with everyone (Signal) to her home screen. \n\n>she can still access my wrist, but she has to think about it for an extra quarter second. It has solved 100% of the problem.", "created_utc": 1680292974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127xdge/update_aita_for_removing_my_wifes_wrist_privileges/", "score": 1329, "replies": ["i love this (i have the same multitext adhd flavor as your wife) and its comforting to see your resolution", "Honestly I have ADHD and you did nothing wrong you set a boundary and she just needs to respect it", "I'm glad you guys were able to work through this. I felt really sad for your wife when you told her you weren't interested in hearing about the things going on in her life. Sometimes my bf and I will send multiple paragraphs to the other during the day about something. It's not demanding attention, we just wish we could be in the same room talking like normal but we can't bc work so we just shoot each other texts. Then we read them and respond when we have time to. I would **NEVER** even think about asking them to not tell me about their day and I would NEVER act like their messages were dismissable and permanently mute them. I actually like hearing about the person I love's life and I hope you learn to appreciate the fact that your wife wants to share her life with you.", "Overhelping and excessive caretaking should be avoided. You need to set real boundaries as it relates to her disordered thinking. You aren't a coping mechanism. You aren't a reassurance machine. Don't infantilize your GF. She needs to give you space while she learns to deal with trivialities on her own.

There's no reason to share the trivialities of your day as they happen. Not every thought nor interaction needs to be shared with our person. You can try writing some of your thoughts down to share with each other when you're physically together. I think it is likely that you find that much of what you write down is of little importance and no more than a fleeting thought. \n\nIt's a mistake to treat a marriage like a 15 year old treats an online discord dalliance. Intimacy is related to the quality of communication rather than the volume.", "I never needed to learn that fact! I love my wife and the time we spend together.

You sure have a very low tolerance for a random thing (alerts) for someone purported to be neurotypical... Just a thought.\n\nBut super glad y'all talked it out successfully! Yay for adult interaction, still undefeated!", "Do you both have iPhones? If you have your phone/watch set to do not disturb when your wife sends you an iMessage she will have the option to \"notify anyway\" for urgent messages, but otherwise can send as many messages as she wants without the notifications coming thru. You can also make a \"personal\" do not disturb setting to allow just her notifications through, or just the app that you use to text her with, as a symbolic gesture - and tell her you'll use that mode at times when an excitement fueled slip up of the \"one text\" rule might be less irritating than other times.", "I text my boyfriend all of the time. He has me (and everyone) on a constant mute. This means I can text him to my hearts content, and I know it won't disturb him, and that he'll check his phone and answer often. Just like OP does. It doesn't make me less special, it doesn't mean he's mot interested in what's going on in my life, in fact it just means he sets the appropriate parameters for him to be able to make me welcome at any time I want, and it's pretty great. Muting someone doesn't mean not caring, and nowhere in this post does it sound like OP doesn't care.", "To some of us it does feel like a demand, nothing anyone says will make it FEEL different to me, I much rather have the face to face conversation once we are both home, i want to listen, but not through multiple texts during the day\n\nI hope you learn to appreciate that people have different needs and feelings and that both sides are equally valid, because you sounded quite condescending to OP", "the *immediacy* is what gets me with the apple watch.

Set boundaries!\u201d replies here, but as a woman with ADHD, I have to say what I appreciate is your understanding of and sensitivity toward your wife. Sometimes no one has done anything \u201cwrong\u201d and there\u2019s miscommunication or assumptions or just years of baggage that make something really hit a sore spot.

I'm glad to hear for both you and your wife that you're both communicative and want understand each other.\n\nI'm so glad that you learned those two big facts! I never had a partner understand the being made to feel small thing until I met my husband because he also has ADHD.", "She should try writing all of her messages out on her phone in a note app when she wants to buzz you multiple times.

He says it made her feel special to be the one that he gets notified of\u2026well, that\u2019s a privilege that she needs to treat as such.

Of course, anytime anything popped into my head I'd message him straight away because I'd forget to tell him about it later. I didn't pressure him to check messages and I didn't tell him how upset it made me. \n\nHonestly, if I was your wife and you set this boundary with the explanation and umderstanding you've given in your update, I would just feel loved.", "Just turn off notifications. How hard is that?", "While I can respect that, it's kind of impossible to not have boundaries. But that might be my autistic black and white thinking and you not actually trying ro be literal. Because when you say have \"no boundaries\" it sounds like \"oh I wouldn't care if you didn't ever clean up after yourself\" or \"oh go ahead and have sex with other people, I don't care\" or basically her doing things that bother you or possibly hurt your feelings.\n\nBut I think I get the gist of what you mean and I'm just taking it too literally.", "You have to have boundaries with everyone, that is how relationships with anyone works.", "You have to have boundaries in every relationship. It really sounds like you baby your wife.", "LOL. Same here. I have ADHD also and am guilty of the rapid fire texts :/ I\u2019ve always done that though and no one\u2019s ever said anything.

I do not see this as you babying your wife.", "As long as you're good with walking on egg shells and letting ADHD be the excuse for it all then good for you. None of my nevermind what others do in their relationship.", "My partner is a lot like you, OP. I have ADHD too, but only got a formal diagnosis last year. A few weeks after I noticed that he seemed to understand a lot more about how my brain was functioning. So if I got overstimulated or had what would seem to most as an overreaction, he would ask, \u201cis your brain telling you I don\u2019t love you? Because I do love you and I will always love you.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long to realize he\u2019s done a bunch of research and reading about being a partner to someone with ADHD and how it makes their brain work. It\u2019s a beautiful thing that you\u2019ve done the same. \n\nPeople saying she should respect the boundary and that you shouldn\u2019t accommodate\u2026 it\u2019s wonderful that you are accommodating her as much as you can. And to those people I ask- when was the last time you fought your brain and won? It is incredibly difficult to fight with your own brain, and requires a lot of training on how to do it. It\u2019s not as straightforward as you\u2019d like to think. For instance, right now stress is exacerbating my trichotillomania, which is telling me to rip out my hair. I have been fighting it for weeks but I still have a bald spot. For the foreseeable future I will be wearing a hat all day every day (and a bonnet at night) because if I can easily get to my hair I will tear it out. I can\u2019t control it. I wish I could. The hat makes an extra step and since it isn\u2019t hair it\u2019s much easier to tell my hands not to mess with it. \n\nMore people need partners like you. I\u2019m really glad the two of you were able to work through it and find a way to set the boundary while still allowing her to feel like she is loved just as she is. It\u2019s an important thing to us neurodivergent folks.\n\nSo yay for you!", "she's worth it \ud83e\udd70", ">when was the last time you fought your brain and won?\n\nwow talk about an armor-piercing question! My partner and I are actually both on the waitlist for an ADHD assessment but it seems a dead cert we both have it - his is more hyperactive, mine is definitely inattentive plus I'm also autistic. So we're at cross purposes with each other a lot of the time and it's definitely gotten way worse since we had covid. My RSD was always pretty bad and he tends to shoot from the hip without thinking about how his words come across if he's stressed (and therefore under increased brainload). Not a good combo\n\neta (bc adhd brain means never getting it all in first go): I feel you on the trichotillomania. I actually started tweezing my leg hairs and pulling out pubic hair so as not to create a bald spot on my head or a gap in my eyelashes (i have a couple and I know that with sjogren's syndrome my eyes need all the protection they can get from dust!)", "thank you!", "I love the resolution here and your take aways.   My wife also has ADHD and the rejection sensitivity is real.  I am a clinical psychologist and I specialize in  working with neurodiversity and the statistics are WILD.  For example, kids with ADHD are told by  adults and peers that they are lacking 20,000 times on average by the time they are 12.   A lot of what folks deal with is a traumatic response to this sort of thing as a kid.  It is FUCKED.", "I think you came off as unintentionally controlling and cruel in your original post, and I\u2019m someone who can understand both points of view. I have ADHD and sensory processing disorder. I have an apple watch, and getting too many buzzes (which feels incredibly uncomfortable to me) can literally make me cry. So I take personal responsibility (the way you expect your wife to about her texts) and remove the watch if I\u2019m getting overwhelmed. If you can\u2019t control your reaction to stimulation, it\u2019s your job to do what you need to be comfortable. I promise your wife tries. I guarantee she texts you multiple times because the thoughts come and go so fast, she\u2019s worried they\u2019ll disappear before she can share them with you, the person lucky enough to be the recipient of her love, with whom she wants to share. I would guess it's almost impossible to grow up a woman with ADHD without being told you are too much, that you talk too much, to calm down and be quiet. Many of us hold the trauma of being silenced and rejected. You\u2019ve reinforced it, all while expecting her to adapt to YOUR non-typical needs. That is what your irritation about notifications is: Non-typical. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, this should help you both understand each other. Your discomfort at something most people are fine with is a common experience for your wife and many others. I am glad you can both empathize with each other now, and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s working hard at being a good, listening partner as well. ADHD doesn\u2019t give us a free pass, but you don\u2019t get one from being \u2018typical\u2019 either. I\u2019m proud of you for compromising, try to remember the balance of needs going forward. It\u2019s not easy but it's worth it!", "Thanks so much for educating yourself about RSD, I hope more people do! It's relatively unspoken about compared to other parts of ADHD but it can potentially be one of the worst symptoms, mine is severe enough that I can set it off by myself (accidentally wasting food is my number one issue) and it often leads to a self-harm fit akin to autistic meltdowns. There's always just an assumption that the person is a sore loser or too sensitive but fucking up or being told no for me at least feels like a fire alarm has just gone off in my head and it's uncontrollable, and if the person with ADHD is undiagnosed or doesn't know about RSD there's an immense amount of guilt and shame because they don't know *why* their feelings are so overwhelming compared to those around them. Just by your update being on the front page of AITA you're helping people learn about something that may significantly impact their lives.\n\nAlso you're a fucking awesome husband, best wishes to you and your wife having a long and happy marriage.", "Seriously i feel you so much about the notification thing. None of my medias or apps have unread notification. I have to mute everything because the single red dot appearance will HAUNT me until i open it. And the sound? One is fine, 2 is annoying, but any more than that and i just start to get either stressed out or pissed. I'm glad you could have a conversation with her though!", "NTA!

Do you happen to have a reference I can use?", "Yup. You can see from my comments my reaction to the chronic lateness discussion recently.

God if I'd known about it as a teenager I think I would have made some *very much* better choices. :X", "Damn, I'm like the OPs wife and boy does it sting to see that statistic laid out like that, since it echoes exactly how I feel.", "I call it gatling-texting.", "i guarantee she texts you multiple times because the thoughts come and go so fast, she\u2019s worried they\u2019ll disappear before she can share them with you, the person lucky enough to be the recipient of her love.", "Woman w/ ADHD (married to Man w/ ADHD lawl) here to second this x1000!", "the right them is out there for you", "it was honestly hard to understand because I am somewhat opposite from her in that way. If someone doesn't like me, fuck 'em, I'll be better off anyway. So it was good to know that she operates differently", "I do. because she rocks and is my rock", "I swear that future generations will laugh at us and our notifications", "i mean the original post was him saying hed only turn on her wrist buzzes if she didnt multitext. when she couldnt do that, he said, \"hey, since i dont want my wrist buzzing as much as it has been, im turning off your wrist buzzing privileges.\" thats literally doing what you said, taking care of his own needs. idk why anyone is acting like he was cruel for trying to arrange an agreement and then renegotiating when that agreement wasnt upheld.", "My RSD and PDA are at constant war with each other, and it's usually when I need them both to shut up that they finally get together in harmony and make me miserable", "Don\u2019t be surprised when it happens again and again and again for the rest of your life. Your not the AH and you won\u2019t be then but she will.", "This is so real. Sometimes it's no one's fault and feelings got hurt anyway. And that's okay.", "Luckily for me it doesn't always kick in, like if someone on the street started pointing out problems with my clothes and face that wouldn't do anything because my appearance isn't something I value. The trigger is if *I* feel like I did something wrong or disappointed somebody I care about, so if your wife is the same then she really does care about your opinion regardless if she thinks you're right or wrong. Makes me wonder if narcissists feel RSD lol.", "Notifications are fucking annoying, especially when they\u2019re vibrating on your wrist when you\u2019re trying to work.", "Notifications are just a pain. I'm 20 and i've been thinking this way since i have a phone (so probably like...12-ish)", "Most people were saying he seemed patronizing and treating his wife like a child, wording it like he was revoking privileges you would do for your kid. Most people didn't see it as cruel in the original from what I saw.", "I hope you learn to appreciate the fact that your wife wants to share her life with you.", "<3", "Amen to this. It's worth it to work through stuff!", "relevant username?", "aww this is heartwarming, thank you", "To be fair, a lot of what is on the sub is straight up abuse. Commenters get lots of practice telling people to leave abusive relationships and not much practice telling people they need to communicate better in healthy ones. Probably because the people in healthy relationships aren\u2019t posting here all that often", "I'm being condescending because I'm being honest? Again if that works for you then go for it lol. Stay blessed now."]}
