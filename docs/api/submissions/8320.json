I mostly stay away from home, due to college\n\nMy mom has developed a habit of snooping around about me, trying to know everything about me, basically being \"too nosy\" in my stuff, it is possible that she was always like this, i just didn't know until I had somethings to hide from her. I normally used to tell her almost everything like about girls I liked or the 1st time I tasted alchohol and stuff like that. She knew the passcode to unlock my phone because I didn't really think she would try to snoop into my phone. \n\nSo I went to visit a friend of mine and I smoked weed there for the first time and I asked my friend to record a video of me doing it and it was just there in my phone. Now as you can already guess, she snooped in and found the video, sent it to my friend's mother with whom I had smoked and went to his house to talk about it all. While I didn't have any knowledge about this until 2 weeks had passed and I found out from someone else.\nI felt bad, betrayed both by my friend(the one I was smoking with) and my mother\n\nWell, I was feeling down and I decided to do something about it. I intentionally put a condom in my wallet, I kept it in a place you wouldn't generally find unless you are searching thoroughly and boom! Today when I was leaving for somewhere without telling her, my mom told me with a nearly crying face \"If you are going to have sex, don't lay on this bed\" (We share the same bed)\n\nThen i told her that I did this intentionally and that I knew she would try to snoop, she started giving excuses like she only needed money. Then I told her straight that if she doesn't respect my privacy, I will lose my respect for her. So that's it, AITA?\n\nAdditional info : Yeah, about the bed sharing thing. I am not financially independent yet, so I can't move out yet and I haven't been provided another room because you all are forgetting, not being given privacy is the main issue here. I'll move out soon as my college ends and my job begins.", "created_utc": 1674733127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lpv1p/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_if_she_doesnt/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The whole \u201cif you\u2019re going to have sex you can\u2019t sleep in this bed\u201d is giving off very very weird vibes.

Your mom shouldn't be snooping really. \n\nI guess you need to evaluate what kind of relationship you want with your mother and put in the work to have that (just like she should). \n\nI will say broadly, if you're doing something you don't want others to know about.

It's none of her business what her adult son does in his free time, so it's time for you to change your passwords and set some boundaries.\n2. She didn't even ask you about the video; she tattled on you to your friend's mom like you were 7.\n3. She snooped some more and flipped out.\n4. ...you share the same bed? As an adult man with his mom? What the hell?\n\nSo I think you should look into covert s\\*xual abuse. It's when no one specific incident happens, but a pattern of emotional behavior still causes a weird bond and emotional damage. I suspect she may have been treating you like a partner rather than a son. Has she confided about her life to you about things that a husband/partner would normally be privy to? Does she like when you share with her because it makes her feel \"special\" rather than being helpful with her advice? Is she helpless sometimes and needs you to come to her rescue? Does she always get weird about your relationships with other people and try to stir up drama? Look into this--it would explain a lot about her behavior and the bed thing.\n\nEdit: typo and clarity", ">basically being \"too nosy\" in my stuff, it is possible that she was always like this, i just didn't know until I had somethings to hide from her.\n\nThat's certainly possible, but it's also possible that as you've gotten older, she's become more conscious that you don't need her in the same way - or, maybe more to the point, that she doesn't have as much control. Some parents don't deal with the empty nest very well. \n\n> I smoked weed there for the first time and I asked my friend to record a video of me doing it and it was just there in my phone.\n\nI mean...why tho? \n\n>I was leaving for somewhere without telling her, my mom told me with a nearly crying face \"If you are going to have sex, don't lay on this bed\" (We share the same bed)\n\nWhoa, okay, this took a turn. You share the same bed? \n\nMaybe this is culture shock talking, but why do you share a bed with your mother? I can think of very few scenarios where it would be either acceptable or healthy for a mother to share a bed with her 22-year-old son. \n\nThis casts everything above in a bit of a different light. If you share a bed because of understandable financial or housing challenges, that's one thing. But I'm not getting that vibe. Maybe I'm reading too far into it, but I get the sense that there are unhealthy attachment issues at play here, which would explain the snooping and the invasive behaviour but also make it very important for you to remove yourself from the situation or actively start setting boundaries.\n\n**NTA**, but...yikes.", "NTA Why are you sharing a bed with your mother? That aside mummy needs to keep her nose out and you need to set boundaries.", "NTA. You really need to learn more about enmeshment and how unhealthy your dynamic with your mum is. Having boundaries with other people, including parents, is healthy. The fact it\u2019s taken you until 22 to have boundaries with her is not. Her reaction to all of this is immensely unhealthy and downright infantilising.", "wth did i just read move out now and get your own bed \n\ni am not putting a judgment on because you got bigger issues here\n\nget a job get your own place and leave your 22 time to grow up", "You share the same bed?", "Way to bury the lead \u2014 end of the fourth paragraph! \u201c(We share the same bed)\u201d is the entire story here, imo.

I would probably be asking for separate beds personally (two singles in the same room for example), or sleeping on the couch, but if you are comfortable with that then that's your decision.\n\nHowever. You need to set boundaries with your mom. Her going behind your back and through your stuff is odd. Change your phone passcode. She's unhealthily attached to you and probably needs therapy. The \"if you're going to have sex you can't sleep here\" comment is weird, you're an adult, you can have sex somewhere and have a shower it's not like you'll come home gross.

The dynamic here is extremely abnormal. \n\nAs others may have alluded it is not normal for an adult son to share a bed for (I assume weeks) with their mother. Occasionally one or two nights in a hotel if you are traveling but in a living situation that is far too intimate. That is not normal or healthy boundaries.\n\nAnd as you can see, this lack of boundaries has trickled down into other areas of your life with your mother going through your phone and your things and knowing far too much about your life. I imagine that when you finally decide to set boundaries she will **raise absolute hell**.\n\nI **strongly** advise that you meet with a therapist and explain this dynamic with him or her. The therapist can then explain to you what is and is not normal and healthy (none of what I'm reading is normal), and can help you set boundaries. You **really** want to do this, because if you are raised without proper boundaries you will not set them in your own life AND you will not properly respect other people's boundaries because you don't know what healthy boundaries look like. You are seriously going to fuck up your interpersonal relationships with other people until you get this sorted out. \n\nA good therapist can guide you through this conversation with your mom, and better set you up for relationships for the rest of your life.
