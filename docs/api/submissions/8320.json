I mostly stay away from home, due to college\n\nMy mom has developed a habit of snooping around about me, trying to know everything about me, basically being \"too nosy\" in my stuff, it is possible that she was always like this, i just didn't know until I had somethings to hide from her. I normally used to tell her almost everything like about girls I liked or the 1st time I tasted alchohol and stuff like that. She knew the passcode to unlock my phone because I didn't really think she would try to snoop into my phone. \n\nSo I went to visit a friend of mine and I smoked weed there for the first time and I asked my friend to record a video of me doing it and it was just there in my phone. Now as you can already guess, she snooped in and found the video, sent it to my friend's mother with whom I had smoked and went to his house to talk about it all. While I didn't have any knowledge about this until 2 weeks had passed and I found out from someone else.\nI felt bad, betrayed both by my friend(the one I was smoking with) and my mother\n\nWell, I was feeling down and I decided to do something about it. I intentionally put a condom in my wallet, I kept it in a place you wouldn't generally find unless you are searching thoroughly and boom! Today when I was leaving for somewhere without telling her, my mom told me with a nearly crying face \"If you are going to have sex, don't lay on this bed\" (We share the same bed)\n\nThen i told her that I did this intentionally and that I knew she would try to snoop, she started giving excuses like she only needed money. Then I told her straight that if she doesn't respect my privacy, I will lose my respect for her. So that's it, AITA?\n\nAdditional info : Yeah, about the bed sharing thing. I am not financially independent yet, so I can't move out yet and I haven't been provided another room because you all are forgetting, not being given privacy is the main issue here. I'll move out soon as my college ends and my job begins.\nMy parents just live together, that's it. There is no affection and my life has been miserable. My dad has his own room and doesn't want to share with anyone \nAbout the weed thing, it was my first time trying it so I wanted to keep it with me as a memory(because I am never gonna do it again)\n\nEdit : Thanks for your advice everyone, they were really valuable. I'll keep them on mind\n\nUpdate : Some people asked me to look up enmeshed and emotional incest, I did and it does seem to be the case for me. And I will shift to my uncle's home for now to end the bed sharing thing, thanks", "created_utc": 1674733127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lpv1p/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_if_she_doesnt/", "score": 641, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As an adult man with his mom? What the hell?\n\nSo I think you should look into covert s\\*xual abuse. It's when no one specific incident happens, but a pattern of emotional behavior still causes a weird bond and emotional damage. I suspect she may have been treating you like a partner rather than a son. Has she confided about her life to you about things that a husband/partner would normally be privy to? Does she like when you share with her because it makes her feel \"special\" rather than being helpful with her advice? Is she helpless sometimes and needs you to come to her rescue? Does she always get weird about your relationships with other people and try to stir up drama?

Some parents don't deal with the empty nest very well. \n\n> I smoked weed there for the first time and I asked my friend to record a video of me doing it and it was just there in my phone.\n\nI mean...why tho? \n\n>I was leaving for somewhere without telling her, my mom told me with a nearly crying face \"If you are going to have sex, don't lay on this bed\" (We share the same bed)\n\nWhoa, okay, this took a turn. You share the same bed? \n\nMaybe this is culture shock talking, but why do you share a bed with your mother? I can think of very few scenarios where it would be either acceptable or healthy for a mother to share a bed with her 22-year-old son. \n\nThis casts everything above in a bit of a different light. If you share a bed because of understandable financial or housing challenges, that's one thing. But I'm not getting that vibe. Maybe I'm reading too far into it, but I get the sense that there are unhealthy attachment issues at play here, which would explain the snooping and the invasive behaviour but also make it very important for you to remove yourself from the situation or actively start setting boundaries.\n\n**NTA**, but...yikes.", "NTA Why are you sharing a bed with your mother?

The dynamic here is extremely abnormal. \n\nAs others may have alluded it is not normal for an adult son to share a bed for (I assume weeks) with their mother. Occasionally one or two nights in a hotel if you are traveling but in a living situation that is far too intimate. That is not normal or healthy boundaries.\n\nAnd as you can see, this lack of boundaries has trickled down into other areas of your life with your mother going through your phone and your things and knowing far too much about your life. I imagine that when you finally decide to set boundaries she will **raise absolute hell**.\n\nI **strongly** advise that you meet with a therapist and explain this dynamic with him or her. The therapist can then explain to you what is and is not normal and healthy (none of what I'm reading is normal), and can help you set boundaries. You **really** want to do this, because if you are raised without proper boundaries you will not set them in your own life AND you will not properly respect other people's boundaries because you don't know what healthy boundaries look like. You are seriously going to fuck up your interpersonal relationships with other people until you get this sorted out. \n\nA good therapist can guide you through this conversation with your mom, and better set you up for relationships for the rest of your life.
