That's terrible and I am sorry", "NTA. Say \"You married him\", every time she says that to you. Every time. If she doesn't like it, she'll stop doing it to you.", "NTA at all. Your mom is being emotionally abusive calling you that, not to mention incredibly childish.\n\nI would recommend family therapy but I'm not sure your mom is in a place to go there. I would just walk away, leave the room, when she calls you that. Seriously NOT okay.\n\nGood luck. Is there a school counselor or someone you can talk to?", "NTA, but maybe this is how it all started with your dad.  I don't know your story with your dad. and don't need to know. but hearing this level of abuse directed to her own son makes you wonder if this is why your dad left.", "Definitely NTA. Your mom, on the other hand\u2026 The suggestion that you just walk away is a good one. Leave the room entirely. Have you tried talking to her about this when you\u2019re both calm rather than in the heat of the moment? Let her know how hurtful it is and that she\u2019s really screwing up your relationship. Best of luck.", "NTA\n\nAbusers tend to repeat behaviours if they get the reaction they want. You have every right to be upset with her, but by screaming at her you\u2019re allowing her to believe she can\u2019t be that horrible because you\u2019re also losing your temper. \n\nNext time she does it, mutter \u201cpathetic\u201d under your breath (just once), turn and walk away. She might start screaming louder or try to get in your face, but just glance at her with pity and go about your day. \n\nYou being the adult will infuriate her and she might try it a few more times, but eventually she\u2019ll give up when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants. \n\nI wish you luck, OP, and I hope you\u2019re near an age where you can move out and move on.", "NTA\n\nYour mother and you should be able to disagree without bringing  your father into this.\n\nI wish I had suggestions for you to change her behavior because it is demeaning other than trying to stop conversation the moment that happens, leave, go to your room, leave the house etc.  I do not recommend escalation.", "NTA. She needs to cut that shit out.", "NTA that\u2019s just her being abusive and using him to degrade you. Don\u2019t believe it.", "nta obligatory though unironic suggestion of going to therapy.", "NTA; I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through and the way your mom is reacting. If your principal doesn\u2019t get back to you in a timely manner, reach out to the guidance counselor or the school nurse.", "NTA\n\nThat's mean of her to say, especially when she chose to marry him but you didn't choose him as a father.", "Both of my parents have been doing this to me for the last 30 years since their divorce,\nI see them very rarely. Neither of them have a relationship with their grandchildren because they haven\u2019t shown they can behave like adults.\nNTA. Tell her to grow the hell up, or this will be her future too.", "OH!

Maybe a bit below the belt but sometimes you have to.", "Make a request in writing. He'll have to address it that way. Or contact the counselor directly. Some schools can be very supportive and sometimes you have to push to remind them they should be more concerned about you than their bottom line.", "I'm sorry for what you're going through. From your post, your mom doesn't sound like a good person by the way she verbally abuses you. That said, having a family fall apart is super tough, and fear makes people do crazy things. It's not excusable, though, and I'm very sorry you're dealing with this. None of this is your fault.", "How would you feel about showing her this thread?", "I don't think you should say pathetic. That sounds like it will escalate.

She was your father for decades, and it has only been a few months.  You are both still learning what the :new normal\" is going to be, and with you hopefully going on to higher education, your life may be in a bit of a flux for several years in the future. \n\nYour mom is wrong to use that tactic.  It is unfair to argue in that manner.  To me, it reflects the myriad of emotions she has about your father, and places them on you.  Ideally therapy, but finding good, inexpensive  (free) therapy is not easy.\n\nHang in there.    Good luck.", "Yea it definitely sounds like having someone to mediate with your mother is the right call.", "I'll email him."]}
