Let mom put him up.", "The fact that he seems to have lost 2 jobs close together makes me think there\u2019s something going on with the brother that needs to be addressed. It sounds like they would be better off moving in with the mom", "The deposit was the same amount as one month's rent ($2k) and as much as I would love to loan him another 2 grand to keep him out if my apartment I can't really afford to be out 4k with the promise that he 'might' be able to get a good paying job. His old one paid exceedingly well for the position and on a realistic standpoint he is unlikely to find a singular job that pays just as well. To keep his apartment he will either have to get really lucky or get multiple jobs.", "Sadly their rent is not only much higher than mine, my brother still hasn't been able to pay me back the money he owes me for his security deposit (both are $2k, so if I pay a month's rent for them I'll be out $4k)\n\nWhile it wouldn't bankrupt me, realistically it would be near impossible for him to pay me back as it is actually really unlikely for him to get another job that pays as well as his old one (our position doesn't pay 6 figures or anything but lays well enough that he was able to make ends meet for a family of 4 in a two bedroom apartment in a nice area. My apartment is near some shopping centers and a park but isn't as nice so the rent is much lower). I'd love to just loan him the money, but unless he can find a comparable job salary he is looking at having to move soon anyway to something cheaper and all I would be doing is delaying the potential inevitable while selling out money I'm not likely to get back", "He didn't lose two jobs. We work for the dame company and our company transfered him to a different location which resulted in him needing to move (which was why he and his family stayed with me the first time). Due to reasons I am unable to disclose at this time he was let go from his position today.\nThe problem is he chose an apartment that would be very difficult to pay for without this position, so now that he doesn't have it, moving is pretty much an inevitability regardless of what I do since it unlikely he will get another job that pays just as well.", "The company was initially helping them when he transfered by paying a couple weeks at a hotel and most of the payments for the storage unit where the vast majority of their stuff still is (they were transferring out of state but due to being in winter at the time many of the roads were closed down so the company agreed to pay the storage unit for their belongings till they can go back up and get them when the roads open).\nThis is why they didn't have furniture and the most they've gotten so far is a couch and the beds they needed. Cookware and such was donated from the extra my mom and I have. When they ran out of Company Dimw for the hotel I let them use my second room to give them a bit more time to look and finalize paperwork so they wouldn't end up stuck in an apartment in a really bad area of the city.\nThe company, until he was let go, as still offering to pay for movers and the truck to get the rest of his stuff down here but I'm unsure if that will still hold.\n(When they transfered me I got the same deals)\n\nA lot of the money issues does come from the fact that, as I said before, the job pays very well for what it is but it isn't like a 6 figure salary or anything. Even for me, I would have hesitated at the apartment he chose due to the price but it is in one of the best areas in the city and next to one of the best schools so I could understand with why he went with it instead of trying for something a little lower priced in a less nice area.\nGot a bit of reference but not go into details, our company pays us Biweekly and my brother and I made the same amount. I could cover one month's rent at my place for less then one pay check, but he needed a paycheck plus some from the next to cover just his rent. He still had enough to pay his bills and food, but rebuilding his savings from the move was going to be a slow process with 4 mouths to feed especially after needing to get even temporary replacements for household items they needed.\n\nMy brother has been a pretty responsible person overall prior to this. He always made sure he could make ends meet and he's only ever had to ask for my help about twice before so a lot of this was just a bad luck on his part.", "We both work for the same company and they actually transfered him, resulting in him needing a new apartment. This was how and why he stayed with me the first time", "OK. Well, maybe mom needs to loan him money. You have done your part and you were disrespected. Tough lesson for them to learn but one that they need to learn. NTA.", "And this time he won't move out again. Because he does not have a job. So he will stay, and let you pay for them.", "NTA. They didn't respect your home the last time.", "Can you and your mother give him money to pay a month's worth of rent?", "NTA.  4 extra people when you are used to living alone is ...A LOT!  Especially people who can't follow 1 rule.  Is the brother going to get unemployment benefits, or did he to something to get himself fired?  If they moved in with you, there is no telling how long they would stay, which could be a total nightmare.  It would be less stress on everybody right now, if (and if you all could afford it) to help them make rent.  It's also time to see what government/charity safety net is out there like emergency food stamps, etc.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThat was a very simple rule. Heck, I'd follow that even if I was not told. \n\n\nSIL messed up.", "Your mom can take him in if shes so concerned. They already disrespected your one rule, that's a hard pass from me. NTA"]}
