He told me that that was impossible but that the issue was that he wanted MY PS4 back, since he was going to chip it (basically he is going to \"hack\" it to be able to install games without having to buy them). Obviously I told him no and gave him my reasons, but he said no and that he wants my PS4. \n\nI told my mom this and she came up with the argument that my sister doesn't have two consoles so my dad is making it even, to which my sister jumped in and said that she didn't give a shit about having one or two consoles, If I am more comfortable with the PS4, I should keep it, since it is mine, my mom stayed silent and didn't say anything. \n\nI cried, screamed and got mad because if I knew that my dad was going to ask me for it 3 YEARS LATER, then I should've kept the PS3 and this problem didn't happen.

Could OP's dad just waltz in and take her clothes if he wanted to or take her bed? And would she still be in the wrong for complaining?\n\nI can see how some people think that crying and screaming over this is an overreaction but as a counselor, I've often seen things like this happen in abusive households. A child forms an emotional bond with an object e.g a toy because they feel safe or comfortable with it, and the object being taken away ellicits intense emotional reactions.\n\nNow I'm not saying your family is abusive nor am I jumping to conclusions but what you said about your dad not allowing you to get a job or buy a ps4 yourself gives me an inclination of financial abuse and it could explain why you had such a visceral reaction. What would happen if you were to buy a ps4 yourself? Are you allowed to buy other things for yourself?\n\nMy advice to approach this is to maybe try to reason with your mum and get her to buy you the ps4 or maybe explain to your dad that you'd sell the Xbox to buy another ps4.\n\nAlso slight YTA for playing Overwatch :)", "NTA but I'm not voicing my opinion on parents like that here anymore because the mods are ridiculous about what you can and can't say", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou don't take gifts once given especially when it comes to family.

A gift is a gift, end of story.  That being said, you REALLY need to work on dealing with your emotions and some better communication strategies.  It's such a simple thing, but seriously just work on taking a few deep breaths when you feel yourself getting frustrated - you can practice regularly while playing video games.  It's way easier to dismiss people when they're being overly emotional compared to having a calm, rational discussion.  'Dad, you gave me this as a gift.  Do you really think it's okay to demand it back without a replacement?'", "NTA.

But it's also just a gaming system...so this is a bit 1st world problems kind of thing.  These things are seriously like $100 now, so just go mow a few lawns or something and buy one.", "Quite dramatic over a video game console but I\u2019m gonna say Nta. It\u2019s not cool to try to take back a gift like that", "NTA. If you were not his daughter, he would not have done this. Similarly if he wasn't your father you wouldn't have cried and screamed.

Move out and take your belongings with you, if you want them to be yours..", "[deleted]", "YTA for how you reacted, considering you're 18 years old. However, the sentiment that the PS4 is yours and that you've taken care of it is entirely valid but your strong emotional response, including crying, screaming, and getting mad is an overreaction.", "A PS4 really isn't worth all this drama, honestly. Your dad shouldn't be taking back a gift after giving it to you, but at the end of the day it's his house and his rules so you'll have to abide by it for now. Your sister seems to not care very much so just ask her if you can carry on playing your games on it, I'm sure she wouldn't mind unless you're on there 24/7. If you really want another PS4 or whatever then just buy your own one with your own money. You said you're 18, so you're old enough to work.", "YTA not because you assumed that it's yours but because you're so childish you don't speak to them anymore over a freaking console..  family in my eyes is the most important thing in life and the fact that you prioritize your console over your family to me is a definite shame", "You don\u2019t say how old you are, so this is more general feedback. A gift given is not usually requested to be returned; it no longer belongs to the person who has possession of it previously. Either it wasn\u2019t a gift, or your dad changed his mind. It sounds like he changed his mind, which makes him an asshole. \n\nScreaming and crying when you\u2019re frustrated is a sign of poor emotional regulation, so you\u2019re absolutely an asshole for that. \n\nESH", "ESH, but you suck the most in this situation.\n\nYou cried and screamed? Over a Playstation?\n\nJesus.", "ESH\n\nIs your dad an asshole? Yes. \n\nDo you and your sister _each_ have _another_ console? \n\nAlso yes.

Sorry, but YTA.  Did you earn the money and buy the PS4 or the tv you play it on, or the room you play it in, or the clothing on your back? No? It's not yours.   \n\n\nI understand that you are upset. You are using that system and your Dad wanting to take it from you so that he can do some illegal, shady sh#t is wrong.   \n\n\nBut yelling at people and acting all entitled is not the way forward here. Screaming at people will almost always make you an AH.   \n\n\nIt's not that you're upset. It's that you are being an AH in the face of that upset.   \n\n\nIf you want a PS4, it's time for a job. I know you're a teen. It's clear in your writing, but I was making my own money by the time I was 14. I was babysitting. So was my brother. I worked at camps. I worked mowing yards. I made money. You can too. Maybe not enough for living on your own, but certainly enough to buy a PS4 that you can really call your own, because it's yours, not because you feel entitled to anything of your parents that happens to be in a room you call your room, but isn't.

They are an opportunity to try different career options and see if you'd like them.   \n\n\nWhat's going on in the bigger picture here? How are you working towards your adult independence? And how are your parents supporting your working towards adult independence?   \n\n\nThat would make a lot more sense here for the level of upset over a stupid machine. Is the PS4 symbolic to you of not being allowed your own path in life? Cause that's a whole different deal there.", "She\u2019s 18. She can do what she wants.\n\nStep 1) apply for jobs sneakily\n\nStep 2) get job and figure out exit strategy\n\nStep 3) exit", "so you think an 18 year old adult can just excuse shitty behaviour by saying its difficult to control my emotions ?  this is not a 4 year old.", "Literally nowhere in this post has this person stated that she cannot buy a new PS4 or get a job.", "Of her inability to control her emotions, maybe.", "And feelings are very rarely the reality of our situation, and are not who we are. \n\nFeelings are just something we *have*, and identifying with them leads to nonsense like crying and screaming over a used PS4 that we'll still have access to, and apparently with an even larger selection of games *for free*.", "Yes, but he collects them and doesn't want to sell any, he has shelves with each console in the order they came out. \n\nI guess so, he's selfish. and it has happened several times that when I have asked him for a game as a birthday gift, he has told me that he didnt have money, but he could buy the gow 2018. \n\nMy grandmother is on my side, she says it was a gift and that he doesn't have the right to take it away from me, but my mom defended my dad.", "Wouldn\u2019t they still be paying a lot due to the conversion rate?

I feel sorry for OP.", "i don't really know, but he wants more emulators when he can fucking run them on his Xbox. \n\nThe worst thing is that he uses the Xbox more than the PS5, I mean it seems stupid to me that he is so mad about wanting my PS4.", "In an ideal world then yes.", "NTA. What kind of father gives his kid something and then makes them give it back? I\u2019m sorry this is happening."]}
