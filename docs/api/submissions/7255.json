Early last year we slowly allowed her back into our lives. We decided with a new year to have a party at our house with the entire family so our mother could meet my wife\u2019s (33f) family. \n\nMy MIL and BIL along with his family are very religious. My wife and I prior to the party spoke with them about keeping their religious views to themselves since my sister would be there with her fianc\u00e9e. They agreed to be respectful at our house. \n\nAs the party was happening, I overheard my BIL mentioning Sodom and Gomorrah. He stated, \u201cGays are condemned to hell, unless they repent of their sins and stop indulging in their sinful ways\u201d Unbeknownst to them, in college I studied Apologetics and Theology. I also studied the Bible in its original context when it was written in Hebrew and Greek. My aunt was also quite religious, but wasn\u2019t condemning like they are. She\u2019s the reason I decided to study the Bible.\n\nBack to the party, I wanted to shut down my BIL permanently. We got into a biblical argument. I referred to the original Hebrew translation, the Sodom and Gomorrah story was not about gays. He argued what his English Bible currently says. I mentioned the food laws in Leviticus as he\u2019s a huge bacon eater. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re not under law anymore, that doesn\u2019t apply to us.\u201d I argued if we\u2019re not under the law of the Old Testament any longer, the Sodom and Gomorrah story is completely pointless to use against the LGBTQ+ community. \n\nHe says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d Why not, I asked. He said immorality is wrong and still applies to us today. I argued our bodies are still the same as when the food laws were written. He started getting irritated at that moment. I then stated, \u201cChristians, like you, will only apply specific rules from the Bible that fit your agenda while overlooking the others that would inconvenience your lifestyle.\u201d He didn\u2019t know how to respond, he walked away. \n\nThe next morning I get on FB to find this lengthy post from him, calling me a blasphemy. He further said he was scared for my wife and child, as I was leading them down a dark path to hell since I brainwashed them with my \u2018satanic\u2019 views. To make it worse, my MIL shared the post. My MIL shared that she felt a dark spirit while at our house and fears something \u2018jumped\u2019 on her, then asked for prayers of deliverance. \n\nThe entire ordeal has embarrassed my wife to the point she doesn\u2019t want leave the house and show her face in public. My wife\u2019s POV is that during the party I should have politely reminded my BIL of our discussion instead of choosing to challenge his beliefs. She says in doing so, the public bashing posts would have never been made and I wouldn\u2019t have wasted time from the party to argue with a brick wall. My POV is that I feel my sister\u2019s pain when people deliberately display their hatred/opposition for her lifestyle. I\u2019m quite frankly over their crap and throwing the Bible at my sister.", "created_utc": 1673640160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b3z4i/aita_for_throwing_scripture_around_to_point_out/", "score": 527, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not religious myself, but I feel it's general knowledge, at least in the US, that they don't follow those rules aside from like the ten commandments. Eating/touching pork, wearing clothes made out of more than one material, selling your daughter into slavery are also common ones people use as a gotcha, but no modern christian follows. Old Testament is usually more of a set of stories that helps them navigate issues, but they don't see it as an end all be all. It's the Jews/Levites who follow that. So it's the Hebrew Bible and more of a history/supplemental information with only the fundamentals being required for Christians. It's like asking why Muslims don't follow the New Testament. Jesus is a part of Islam, but they view him as a Prophet and not the son of God. They like him but Mohammad supercedes him, so they recognize The Injil and not the New Testament or Old Testament as they view those as falsified, corrupted, and outdated even if they can agree with some of what is in there.\n\nThe New Testament supercedes Old Testament and does also talk about homosexuality and eternal damnation, which if you were to point out hypocrisy, that would be the book to use.\n\nSo again, NTA. I'm just saying it was a flawed argument and there would have been better ways to defend your sister from their nonsense. Though it doesn't seem like their family had any good comebacks or much of a defense either, so I wouldn't expect them to be able to defend themselves even if confronted with hypocrisy from the correct texts. It might have gone over their heads anyway.\n\nIf I got anything wrong, sorry. Like I said, I'm not religious, but this has been my understanding, and what I feel like is the general concensus on modern/mainstream christianitys stance.
