She asked, you said no. She\u2019s not entitled to your clothes - even outside of the fact that they don\u2019t fit her. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nEven putting the size issue aside, you don't owe her your dress. She asked, you denied. \n\nIf she wants a dress, she can buy one or get a personalized dress stitched similar to yours, but you don't HAVE to give the dress and you don't need a reason for it, even though you have a reasonable one.", "NTA - I can see why you'd rather not say 'yes' and then watch her rip your dress apart. Your mom should just talk to your delusional sister instead of blaming you... it's not like she has any rights to your clothing? She can just  buy her own and see how well a XS fits her.", "NTA it\u2019s easy in families to fall into a pattern of giving the boat rocker anything they want when they make a stink. It becomes so second nature that you start to feel like you\u2019re in the wrong for not giving in to their demands. We could ask the question another way: Am I the Asshole for not letting my sister ruin my dress and swallowing the cost? You need to calmly talk to your mom alone about the pattern you\u2019ve all fallen into and how unhealthy it can be.", "NTA. If she is not going to fit, she is not going to fit. She is much more likely to damage the dress trying to fit in too.", "NTA\n\nSize doesn\u2019t matter here. It\u2019s yours, to lend out (or not) at your discretion. That boundary should be respected.", "NTA. Why do people not get that no is the final answer. It\u2019s not 20 questions.", "NTA.  after calling  you that disgusting word?   Over a dress?   She can forget it...and go buy one herself", "NTA. No obligation to lend. Period. The more favorable factor here is that you already know this is not going to fit her, which could lead to any number of ways that your dress might be ruined (e.g., zipper sticking, buttons popping, rips/tears, stretching fabric, etc.). Why should anyone have to accept that risk? I cannot think of any. On the point of your mother's comment, one would suppose, hypothetically, that you could offer a dress if your sister (or mother) is willing to agree beforehand to pay for any necessary repairs for damage that your sister does to the dress--but it does not make you TA for not offering that option, especially if neither your sister nor mother ever asked you to offer it.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt won't fit anyway, she would just ruin it. She can do that to her own dresses.", "NTA However did you specifically say no because of her weight without being prompted for a reason? If so, I could understand why the argument happened, in any case you're not obligated to lend anything unless you agree.", "NTA. No means no and I wouldn't lend your sister anything ever again if that is how she treats you.", "Info: did you tell her she couldn\u2019t borrow it because of her size?", "NTA\n\nYour sister is clearly in denial about her weight gain, but to avoid any discussion you could've just let her borrow the dress as it wouldn't fit her anyway. Your sister is an AH though for not accepting your no, which you had every right to say.", "[deleted]", "Did she try on the dress at all? \n\nAre you certain that it would not fit?\n\nWould her wearing the dress have damaged it?", "NAH. But i would have given her the dress so that she could find out by herself that it doesn't fit her at all.", "NTA for saying no. You\u2019re allowed to deny someone borrowing a possession, that\u2019s how owning thinks work.\n\nHowever it was rude to assume the dress wouldn\u2019t fit, if that was the only reason you said no. Sizing runs differently and it\u2019s possible it could fit. You could have let her try it on and decide whether or not to lend it based on that.\n\nAlso, you might want to try giving her a little grace. She\u2019s probably not in denial so much as incredibly self conscious and stressed by the weight gain. Saying something like that could be making it worse.", "[deleted]", "YTA for not letting your sister borrow a dress for a wedding. While it is understandable that you may not want to lend out clothes that have never been worn, you could have handled the situation better. Instead of outright refusing, you could have explained to your sister that the dress would not fit her and offered to help her find something else to wear. It is not fair to call your sister in denial or shame her for her weight gain, and it is important to be supportive and understanding, especially when it comes to something as important as a family event.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your clothes, your right to say no.", "NTA, as someone who has gained weight since 2020 (was size S and now size L), your sister is not going to fit your dress no matter how much she denies it. It\u2019s your dress and she\u2019s not entitled to your closet. I understand her feelings that she\u2019s no longer her old size, but she really should go buy something that currently fits her.", "NTA\n\nIt isn\u2019t going to fit her. But it\u2019s your dress and it\u2019s your choice to loan clothing out or not regardless of the reason.", "NTA. You both are grown a$$ women. She asks, you decline, done. How on earth does mom even have a say?!? Your dress, your rules.", "What was she going to do with an xs, wear it as an earring? NTA", "So better to see the dress rip apart when trying it on? It's not like her sister is entitled to her clothing.", "Yes the material isn\u2019t that stretchy and the dress is even a bit tight on me so it wouldn\u2019t have fit her.", "I can see where you\u2019re coming from but don\u2019t agree. Sister isn\u2019t necessarily an AH for being in denial but she absolutely is for calling OP a c\ud83d\udc9cnt for not bending to her will. Based on the mother\u2019s reaction this is common behaviour for the sister e.g throwing tantrums to get her way and acting like a spoiled child. Maybe trying on a dress that won\u2019t do up or maybe barely fit over her head might be a wake-up but I doubt it because she must already deal with her old clothes no longer fitting", "The OP knows what size her own body is.  And what size her own dress is.  Do you really think she can't look at her sister and know whether or not the dress would fit?", "She\u2019s a size large and the dress visibly doesn\u2019t fit her, the material isn\u2019t all that stretchy and if I had thought it would fit her I\u2019d let her have it.", "I assume she did say 'sorry but this specific dress you want is too small' or something alike...  if the sister had even tried it on, it might have even ripped in the process just to make a point.  Also, OP said there was no shaming involved.", "Read OP\u2019s comment that the dress is visibly too large, and agree there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying no if she thinks it\u2019s likely to get damaged", "I don't think the sister is entitled to her clothing but I'm struggling to understand why her trying it on means she would have \"ripped it apart\" or damaged it for certain. I don't feel like the average person forces clothing on to the point of damage. I'm sure it happens but I'm going to assume her sister is a normal person that would stop trying to put it on if it's not fitting.", "Oof... then no, you are not obligated to let your sister damage your dress because she doesn't want to see that her body has changed.\n\nNTA.", "Fair", "[deleted]", "So why not just let her try it on?  If it doesn't fit problem solved and no hurt feelings.", "I told her that it may be too small, because it was too tight on me and I told her that our other sister had a dress similar too the one in my closet", "Probably because it's likely that the dress is small enough that she tears it or otherwise causes damage. Then the problem not only still exists, but it's worse and now both OP and her sister have hurt feelings.", "Because the dress could rip?", "Could be to save the sister\u2019s dignity? If you know it won\u2019t fit, and someone\u2019s in denial about their size, then maybe it would\u2019ve made the sister feel worse", "if that's truly how you worded it, then NTA. unless you were rude or offensive in the way you told her she wouldn't fit, like making comments about her weight or something, there's nothing wrong with not letting someone borrow your clothes, it is yours after all. especially since it's already almost too small for you and you offered an alternative solution by suggesting your other sister had a similar one as well. there's really no reason for her to have called you the c word.", "Your mum? You are 24, not 14. Make it clear to Mummy Dearest that choosing what you do with your own belongings is none of her business. Your sister should have bought a dress or figured it out rather than be a brat about it.

I had a similar fight with my sister years ago (not due to size, i had wanted to wear this dress to her wedding. She wanted it for her bachelorette party and i told her no.) She got my dad involved and after getting my side he told her that it was my dress and i had every right to tell her no. The reason doesnt matter. No is reason enough.", "Seriously? How does she think that she could fit into that size dress?", "Tell mom she can buy her a dress that fits her, instead of mom insisting she ruin yours.", "NTA. She would have stretched and ruined it. And you don\u2019t have to lend her your dresses, regardless.", "This right here, if I had an award I\u2019d give you it! \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nTell your mother she can hand over one of her favorite dresses and not be difficult to your sister.", "NTA", "NTA but if she is so much bigger than you give her the damn dress so she can realize it doesn\u2019t fit? I mean unless it a type of material that rips easily she wouldn\u2019t be able to get it on even\u2026. Right?", "Sure have her pay you for it because you know she\u2019s going to ruin it!", "NTA, they\u2019re your clothes and you\u2019re not obligated to share them with anyone.

Her sister wears a larger size than OP. The dress that is too small for someone smaller than her is going to be too small for OP\u2019s sister. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s on the rack and at a store, where sizing runs differently. This is something from OP\u2019s closet that doesn\u2019t fit OP, who is several clothing sizes smaller than her sister. If it doesn\u2019t fit someone smaller because it\u2019s too small, it won\u2019t fit someone larger than the first person who was too big.", "No to so many things in this.", "> if I had an award I\u2019d give you it!\n\nI had a few coins lying around, and took care of it.", "If it\u2019s too small, either the material is going to stretch in a way that would ruin the dress, tearing will occur at the seams, the zipper might break (I\u2019ve done that too clothes less than a full size too small, never mind 3-4 sizes too small), or she could get pissed and intentionally ruin/damage the dress for not fitting. OP can\u2019t even wear it, and she\u2019s multiple sizes smaller than her sister."]}
