Your mom should just talk to your delusional sister instead of blaming you... it's not like she has any rights to your clothing? She can just  buy her own and see how well a XS fits her.", "NTA it\u2019s easy in families to fall into a pattern of giving the boat rocker anything they want when they make a stink. It becomes so second nature that you start to feel like you\u2019re in the wrong for not giving in to their demands. We could ask the question another way: Am I the Asshole for not letting my sister ruin my dress and swallowing the cost? You need to calmly talk to your mom alone about the pattern you\u2019ve all fallen into and how unhealthy it can be.", "NTA. If she is not going to fit, she is not going to fit. She is much more likely to damage the dress trying to fit in too.", "NTA\n\nSize doesn\u2019t matter here. It\u2019s yours, to lend out (or not) at your discretion. That boundary should be respected.", "NTA. Why do people not get that no is the final answer. It\u2019s not 20 questions.", "NTA.  after calling  you that disgusting word?   Over a dress?   She can forget it...and go buy one herself", "NTA. No obligation to lend. Period. The more favorable factor here is that you already know this is not going to fit her, which could lead to any number of ways that your dress might be ruined (e.g., zipper sticking, buttons popping, rips/tears, stretching fabric, etc.). Why should anyone have to accept that risk? I cannot think of any. On the point of your mother's comment, one would suppose, hypothetically, that you could offer a dress if your sister (or mother) is willing to agree beforehand to pay for any necessary repairs for damage that your sister does to the dress--but it does not make you TA for not offering that option, especially if neither your sister nor mother ever asked you to offer it.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt won't fit anyway, she would just ruin it. She can do that to her own dresses.", "NTA However did you specifically say no because of her weight without being prompted for a reason? If so, I could understand why the argument happened, in any case you're not obligated to lend anything unless you agree.", "NTA. No means no and I wouldn't lend your sister anything ever again if that is how she treats you.", "Info: did you tell her she couldn\u2019t borrow it because of her size?", "NTA\n\nYour sister is clearly in denial about her weight gain, but to avoid any discussion you could've just let her borrow the dress as it wouldn't fit her anyway. Your sister is an AH though for not accepting your no, which you had every right to say.", "[deleted]", "Did she try on the dress at all? \n\nAre you certain that it would not fit?\n\nWould her wearing the dress have damaged it?", "NAH.

You\u2019re allowed to deny someone borrowing a possession, that\u2019s how owning thinks work.\n\nHowever it was rude to assume the dress wouldn\u2019t fit, if that was the only reason you said no. Sizing runs differently and it\u2019s possible it could fit. You could have let her try it on and decide whether or not to lend it based on that.\n\nAlso, you might want to try giving her a little grace. She\u2019s probably not in denial so much as incredibly self conscious and stressed by the weight gain. Saying something like that could be making it worse.", "[deleted]", "YTA for not letting your sister borrow a dress for a wedding. While it is understandable that you may not want to lend out clothes that have never been worn, you could have handled the situation better. Instead of outright refusing, you could have explained to your sister that the dress would not fit her and offered to help her find something else to wear. It is not fair to call your sister in denial or shame her for her weight gain, and it is important to be supportive and understanding, especially when it comes to something as important as a family event.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your clothes, your right to say no.", "NTA, as someone who has gained weight since 2020 (was size S and now size L), your sister is not going to fit your dress no matter how much she denies it.

Sister isn\u2019t necessarily an AH for being in denial but she absolutely is for calling OP a c\ud83d\udc9cnt for not bending to her will. Based on the mother\u2019s reaction this is common behaviour for the sister e.g throwing tantrums to get her way and acting like a spoiled child. Maybe trying on a dress that won\u2019t do up or maybe barely fit over her head might be a wake-up but I doubt it because she must already deal with her old clothes no longer fitting", "The OP knows what size her own body is.  And what size her own dress is.  Do you really think she can't look at her sister and know whether or not the dress would fit?", "She\u2019s a size large and the dress visibly doesn\u2019t fit her, the material isn\u2019t all that stretchy and if I had thought it would fit her I\u2019d let her have it.", "I assume she did say 'sorry but this specific dress you want is too small' or something alike...  if the sister had even tried it on, it might have even ripped in the process just to make a point.

I don't feel like the average person forces clothing on to the point of damage. I'm sure it happens but I'm going to assume her sister is a normal person that would stop trying to put it on if it's not fitting.", "Oof... then no, you are not obligated to let your sister damage your dress because she doesn't want to see that her body has changed.\n\nNTA.", "Fair", "[deleted]", "So why not just let her try it on?  If it doesn't fit problem solved and no hurt feelings.", "I told her that it may be too small, because it was too tight on me and I told her that our other sister had a dress similar too the one in my closet", "Probably because it's likely that the dress is small enough that she tears it or otherwise causes damage.

The dress is yours. ...I'm not seeing how her not having a dress that fits her properly is your fault...especially since your dress is way too small for her. And I can say that bc I'm plus sized.

Either would be acceptable as far as I am concerned but trying to understand why she resorted to calling names. You never have to loan out your clothes, let alone one that you haven't even worn yet. She could have ruined it by trying to force herself into, and since she isn't admitting her weight gain, would have probably blamed it on you anyway. Or she wouldn't have tried in on until she was getting ready to go and then blamed you because she had to stay home when the dress didn't fit. Hopefully, after this, she will never ask again. Your sister definitely should not have called you names.  Sorry, but you did not have to give her the dress to wear, and your mother is definitely wrong to say so. Is your sister the \"Golden Child\" in your family? Your mom's response kind of implies that she might be. Or maybe your mom is just as unrealistic about your sister's weight gain as your sister is?", "NTA either way but especially as it was a dress OP hasn't even worn herself yet.", "I wholly agree that no means no.  The size has a significance beyond the labels or weight gain:  if the sister tried to wear the dress that was several sizes too small for her, and which OP had reportedly not yet worn, it's quite likely that she would have damaged it. At the very least it would have been badly stretched out.  \n\nWomen's clothing sizing varies wildly, but [the difference between XS and L](https://www.dresssizes.org/xs-s-m-l-xl.htm) is, conservatively, the difference between size 2 and size 12, and at least 7\" at each of waist, bust, and hip.

And no, before someone comments, I am not tiny, my weight has fluctuated a lot over the years, I've just learned cut and fit matter more than size.\n\nEdit: forgot to add, NTA.", "As someone who has lent items and never received them back, noooooooooo bad idea.", "In no world would an XS an L be the same size due to different brands.", "A size L pweson will not fit into an XS dress without destroying it.  Your mother should know that.  It's time to stop tiptoeing around the truth and have a frank discussion with her about size and accepting the truth.\n\nOffer to measure your sister around her breasts, waist, and hips.  Then lay the dress flat on the table and measure it.  (It measures 10\" at the waist multiply by two and you have the waist measurement.)  Show her the difference between what will fit her and that dress.  If she doesn't accept it, brutal hinesty.  \"You are 6\" inches to wide for it.
