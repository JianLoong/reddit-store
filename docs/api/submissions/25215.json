Also because I'm generally pretty pro sex work/sex stuff. She may have been reacting in the moment and didn't mean the comment on her safety - hopefully. I'd argue this kind of \"sex work\" is even less exploitative than actual sex work, and in that way it's actually safer.

Damn, congrats on finding this financial life hack.  \n\nMy advice would be to have a gentle talk with her about the limits of what you will and won\u2019t do, and maybe point out that this is a less-exploitative alternative to *actual* porn.  Maybe bring up that your clients are likely very emotionally invested in these characters - fictional characters, who cannot be harmed by this - or else they wouldn\u2019t want *that character.*  They don\u2019t want a generic hot body, they want a character with a personality and a backstory, looking hot.

I think it falls within the gray area that maybe you could have asked but I don't think it's reasonable for her to be so upset like this.\n\n Just because you're drawing naughty pictures doesn't mean that you're cheating on her or that you're some bad person.

She never said that she didn't want you to do that, and I think that it's in a gray area that I wouldn't think would be obvious to people that they wouldn't want you to do that. I think that people who post sexy pictures of themselves are in that gray area too. Not full on nudity but just risque or revealing pictures.

At the same rates?", "That's because straight porn dominates the industry and the whole point of it is to humiliate and degrade women.\n\nGay porn is degrading to men too, but at the same time men are also doing the degrading.\n\nIn conclusion, read a book.", "When does it become porn.", "He has an Instagram of his hobby made 3-d renders, his \u201cporn\u201d is private commissions for people they pay for, op isn\u2019t into making it for personal use and doesn\u2019t upload it to his insta which makes sense", "Is having a finsta and a priv and showing someone your finsta first \u2018hiding things\u2019?\n\nNo.  The guy prolly has the \u2018normal\u2019 insta for more \u2018respectable\u2019 folks that wouldn\u2019t want to get art signed by someone known for drawing porn", "\"Any normal woman would be\"\n\nActively fuck off with that.  Sincerely, a woman.", "And Scrooge McDuck.", "I would give your wife some time. Let her know that it isn't about anything sexual and stop describing it as porn. Take her to a museum and a high-end art gallery show her real art. Explain the difference there is a difference between nudity and sex but she doesn't understand that. Is the only time she is naked for sex and bathing? Education is the only thing to change her mind. I mean, an R rated movie has the same type of content. Have her see an r rated movie with you or Healer Redo. That shit will make your work look like Sunday school material.", "I deployed a new server at work the other day. I very much didn't bother to show my wife.  Am I hiding things from her?", "It\u2019s sad how insecure some people are in their relationships. It really is.", "I have to admit that if I don't wish to discuss something, I change the subject but I don't see that as hiding it. I see it as private but of asked directly, I would answer the question without lying. Again just maintaining privacy.\n\nBut then, those are my values I place on something. Your values on the same thing  may well be totally different.", "Hey if you can find me an anti-porn group that is not anti-virtualporn and is actually focused on exploitation, point me in that direction.\n\nIn my experience, talk of exploitation is a tactical misdirection to get people on board with total porn bans. \n\nSimilar to Republicans claiming they are only against illegal immigration, but Republican policies include restricting legal immigration.", "Out of curiosity, would you give a pass for animated porn featuring children?", "\"I can't define it, but I know it when I see it\"", "\u201cPornography\u2013\"porn\" or \"porno\" for short\u2013is material that depicts nudity or sexual acts for the purpose of sexual stimulation.\u201d\n\nUnless OP is making them for the express purpose of being getting off on/with them than they are simply 3D printed figurines of fictional characters. What OPs customers do with them is a different story. \n\nLike those car calendars with bikini models they aren\u2019t porn but people do use them as masterbatory aids", "Exactly.  My wife knew if I was playing a video game I particularly liked.", "Agreed I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s something he chose to do because he thought he was doing anything wrong more for the fact he knew she wouldn\u2019t approve and he wanted the peas still", "It's *extremely* weird that you care so little about his art. I feel bad for him.", "Do you know your wife's hobbies?\n\nIf your wife was an artist, would you ask to see her art sometimes?  \"What are you working on right now, hon?  I'd love to see your work.\"\n\nAnd it's weird his wife never asked him that, too.  \n\nHell, my sister lives in California, but I knew when she switched from knitting to leatherworking.  My Christmas got changed from a scarf to a wallet.", "Sure.  \n\nBut your biggest hobby/side gig is the kind of thing most people share with their wives.", "Nailed it. Remember TraffickingHub? It's from Exodus Cry. An anti porn group. They made up lies and people believed them. They've destroyed sex workers' income. The best part? Laila, the founder? She's posted CSAM on her Twitter. She's actually the problem, but she's managed to convince people that sex work is by telling lies.", "First of all, rest assured, your hentai is safe. But sometimes, the Evangelicals are right. Falwell going after Playboy and Penthouse is one thing. Today's porn is just so fucked up in so many different ways, I don't know where to begin or end, and besides, you don't need me to tell you. At some point, any rational adult knows that not every woman wants cum in her face like she were being christened with water from the fountain of youth. In fact, I'm willing to bet most women do not feel the ritualistic desire for bukkake, ever. But in porn, they all do.\n\nIf you could end the mass exploitation and degradation of women with the sacrifice of cartoon porn, would you do it? I think it would be inhumane not to.", "I\u2019d say skimpy outfits and suggesting posing are made for sexual stimulation. It absolutely is porn. Not explicit, but porn nonetheless.", "OP has outright stated multiple times that it's porn, and that it's \"lewd\" and sexual. So it's weird to be like \"Umm actually, it's not *technically* porn.\"\n\nLike, I think the guy would know...\n \nEither way, you know what's not going to save OP in this argument? Fighting over the technical definition of pornography.", "As Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said during *Jacobellis v. Ohio*, \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d \n\n\nIt\u2019s porn bro", "Fair point. Thanks for your perspective. I could revise my statement and say my husband only shows me work he is particularly proud of anymore.\n\nIt seems we have no real understanding if have shared values. Like, does he perceive this work as being deviant in some way? Might he have guessed she would feel this way? The fact that he works in the living room on an unsecured device and was genuinely surprised by her reaction lends credibility to NOT deceiving her, but everything you noted is at least a version of lying by ommision.", "And his wife knew he did art. Just not what kind. To me it is just art so I would probably would have been doing it in front of her before we got married. \n\nI can see that it may be a form of porn though but as someone already pointed out, erotic art/ Jessica Rabbit...? She doesn't float my boat but she supposed to be a 'sexy' cartoon character and apparently, it's a turn on for some people.", "Idk, sounds like you bought into the moral panic.\n\nWhy would we ban something that harms no one?\n\nIf these evangelicals want to win over more people, they should put forward a reasonable position.\n\nAll porn bad is not reasonable and that seems to be all we are getting.\n\nLike I said. I assume there are some people who are against exploitive porn in good faith, but I have yet to find a single anti-porn group that is working for the right reasons.", "Playboy had a 10 year old Brooke Shields nude shoot. Thats fucked up. Not every naked person is being exploited but on the same token many of them are. That being said we are talking about anime characters that are not real people so what\u2019s the spiral here? If ppl wanna beat their meat to some sexy cartoons who am I to say boo\u2026 it\u2019s better than a fuckin human trafficking victim or heroin addict.", "Do you think that way when you see women in \u201cskimpy\u201d outfits that they are purely for sexual stimulation?", "Not your bro and no it isn\u2019t figures like OP described are sold in nearly every comic book store and collectibles shop they aren\u2019t porn they\u2019re just risqu\u00e9 \ud83d\ude44", "Again, you have nothing to worry about. Porn isnt going anywhere. I asked a completely hypothetical question: if you could save these women from porn, and all the bad messages porn sends to men, would you be willing to sacrifice cartoon-porn?", "And not all porn is bad, but I'm going with most.", "Dude, come on. \n\nIt\u2019s about context in this specific scenario. These people are commissioning OP to have certain characters be specifically dressed and posed in arousing ways (ie provocative and stimulating), so in this case, it is porn.\n\nA woman in a skimpy outfit minding her own business is obviously not meant to sexually stimulate people around her, or that should at the very least the normal and moral thing to assume as some other random person also minding their own business.\n\nLet\u2019s not be obtuse about it.", "Relax bud, whatever makes you sleep at night. \n\n*1000% porn*", "I mean yes but it is an incredibly baiting and misleading question. \n\nWould you be willing to ban women from voting or speaking in public if it brought an end to all murders?\n\nIt is a ridiculous ask for a ridiculous hypothetical. The kind of strategy used in radicalization\u2026 which is why I assume you have already been radicalized yourself.", "Also not you\u2019re bud", "Bro, chill. I'm not on a crusade, I was just following the logic of these groups you disdain. To me, it seems like you support the crux of their mission, which is to end porn because it exploits and degrades women. But your support ends when that mission also includes eradicating the relatively marginal (but substantial in and of itself) cartoon-porn.\n\nI have had no encounters with any anti-porn groups. But, I can certainly see why they exist: porn is a disgusting industry, and we all enable it with our mouse. But if some higher power gave me the opportunity to destroy porn, including cartoon porn, well then I think that is an easy decision to make, unless I'm high on coke and super horny.", "Easy friendo, we can at least all agree that op should\u2019ve been honest with his income"]}
