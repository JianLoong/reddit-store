Also because I'm generally pretty pro sex work/sex stuff. She may have been reacting in the moment and didn't mean the comment on her safety - hopefully. I'd argue this kind of \"sex work\" is even less exploitative than actual sex work, and in that way it's actually safer.

Damn, congrats on finding this financial life hack.  \n\nMy advice would be to have a gentle talk with her about the limits of what you will and won\u2019t do, and maybe point out that this is a less-exploitative alternative to *actual* porn.  Maybe bring up that your clients are likely very emotionally invested in these characters - fictional characters, who cannot be harmed by this - or else they wouldn\u2019t want *that character.*  They don\u2019t want a generic hot body, they want a character with a personality and a backstory, looking hot.

It's not that weird. He has never seen me at my workplace and has no idea what I do day to day. Certainly hasn't seen my \" work product\". \n\nIf he wasn't hiding it , then is he really an AH?", "Your opinion", "Is it? He\u2019s being commissioned it\u2019s not like these are his ideas", "In her shoes, the way I would view it is that since he shared some of his work and only chose non lewd images, then he was hiding the fact that he does lewd work. Your husband doesn't share any of his work with you, he's not hand picking what you do and don't see so you only have one view of his work, you just see none of it. To me, that's different than 'happening' to choose to share only non lewd work. I understand where she wild feel betrayed and like he hid things and in my view point he did. Is doing nude work okay? Sure. Do I think she's overreacting? Absolutely. Do I think, intentionally or not, he hid he does lewd work? Yes."]}
