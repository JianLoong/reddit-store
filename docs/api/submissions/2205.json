Before I tell this story I have worked customer service a lot and this hostess was the first customer service worker I have ever snapped at.\n\nSo I had an order for pick up at a local italian restaurant. I got to the restaurant a little early, checked if the order was ready and the hostess said no, but it should be about ten minutes. I thanked her, sat down down and played on my phone during the wait, and even gave them an extra few minutes. Finally i got up and asked about the order. Hostess once again told me \u201cabout ten minutes\u201d. I was slightly annoyed that fifteen minutes after being told ten minutes I was again told it would be ten minutes, but shit happens, I get it. I sat down and again waited fifteen minutes. Finally I went go the hostess again and asked about the order, to which she told me it was almost done and they will bag it up shortly. Once again I sat down and waited, now kicking myself for not just dropping the order and moving on. Again I waited over ten minutes. Finally I asked the hostess AGAIN about the order and surprise surprise, it was going to be a few more minutes. I was pretty annoyed by this point and without thinking I just blurted out \u201cDid you actually check or are you just saying that again?\u201d She gave me a look like I was being unreasonable so I explained to her that I had been waiting for almost an hour because she kept saying it was almost ready. She looked exasperated but said she would go check on it. The kicker is that I watched her go behind the bar to check for it, she came back empty handed, and than pulled it the order out from the behind her counter\u2026 meaning it had been ready. She handed it to me without looking at me or saying anything, no apology, just a curt nod and that was it\u2026. Im not necessarily proud of this next part, but I told her that she had just wasted almost an hour of my time and to maybe consider checking before telling people it wasn\u2019t ready in future.\n\nJust to be clear, the restaurant was not overly busy, and even if it had been I can forgive a kitchen being backed up, it happens. I feel weird about snapping at a customer service worker but cant help but also feel slightly justified since she apparently had the order for a while and just had not bothered to check.

She was asleep on the job which cost you much time. And you did not snap at her. You defied her canned responses and  that was a perfectly reasonable response to the nonsense she imposed on you . You rightly forced her to face the issue.

I had a hostess pull this trick on me at a relatively expensive seafood restaurant. Didn\u2019t look for order for 30 minutes but it was ready the whole time.", "NTA. You were a lot nicer to her than almost anyone else would have been. No one wants cold food because an employee is not doing their job and simply paying attention. Hopefully she changes her ways, because the next person she does that to may not be so kind.", "NTA.  Gives customer service workers a bad name.", "NTA, I get why this happens, but it doesn't excuse it.\n\nI'd often turn off about 80-90% of my mind at work too, but you gotta remember to at least keep enough of your mind on.  Think she was just in NPC mode, and forget the step where she actually does check on the order.", "I started out thinking Y  T  A, but waiting an hour for a delivery order?  NTA.  With what you are doing time is money and that hostess wasted your time.\n\nShe should have checked with the kitchen.  Orders go missing, fall on the floor, etc and so on.

What time was the order supposed to be done? You stated you got there early, how early?", "NTA.\n\nI had the same issue a few months back with a Biryani place near me. Kept giving me the run around and I finally snapped and told the hostess (after waiting for over 1.5hr and she refusing to cancel my order), that her not checking was ridiculous. I told her to check as one CSR to another, she needs to get herself in gear bc a front of house takes the hit, and to get correct information when presented with a problem. Saying \u201c15 mins more\u201d 2-3 times is a joke and a quick way to make someone angry. \n\nHonestly I haven\u2019t ordered from there again.\n\nAre you able to leave a comment on what occurred to the person who ordered? That way they know you didn\u2019t go galavanting or something?", "NTA But this was intentional bc this restaurant doesn't want to deal with these delivery services anymore. Do you tip when you pick things up? I wouldn't take orders from there again.", "And they\u2019ll take it out on delivery driver saying they waited too long.", "NTA. I would have complained to the restaurant.", "NTA\n\nYou sound pretty polite actually", "NTA\n\nBut learning point for you to challenge after the first delay.\n\nImagine that was your food... An hour delay is ridiculous and the poor end customers food would've been cold\n\nAnd sadly... As the delivery driver you'll likely be blamed from both sides \ud83d\ude16", "NTA. I would have insisted they remake the food; after an HOUR sitting, it's not safe to eat anymore.", "NOT the AH.  You were totally justified for getting upset.  You waited almost an HOUR and the food was ready all along? Holy moly that would have infuriated me no end!", "NTA, you started politely and finally had to get to the point in order to complete your job. She didn't even check on the order, which is now late and likely cold for your customer.", "NTA your reaction was mild. They wasted your time .", "NTA, but as a fellow gig worker, at that second \"ten more minutes\", I'm dropping the order. The most I'll wait for an order is 10 min. Otherwise I'm losing money.", ">You were a lot nicer to her than almost anyone else would have been\n\nIncluding the kitchen. Letting food die in the window is an easy way to piss off the cooks. If she ever moves to waitressing she's going to find out pretty quick.", "I honestly would have asked for the manager and gotten a refund. I'm not paying for cold food because you're lazy.", "It was behind the hostess's podium the hole time. She is just a lazy asshole.", "I was going to say it's almost as bad as taking food to the wrong table, but even that can be an honest mistake.", "Wrong table happens but everyone that's worked in a restaurant remembers the endless dinging from the chef as he says, \"How hard is it to run the food\". A more polite chef will ask what the specific server is up to and a meaner chef will start swearing at any server that comes up to the window. \n\nHonestly once its left the pass its not our problem anymore. Unless it comes back. Unless of course the server let it die and then yeah it is once again the servers problem.", "NTA. You are extremely nice. I would have demanded it be reheated for sitting 30+ minutes getting cold.", "NTA. I think that anyone who disrespects someone in customer service is at the bottom of the food chain. \n\nBut the audacity of this lady not doing her job\u2026", "NTA \n\nThat was 100% her fault", "NTA - I\u2019m currently a host and have worked in restaurants for a long time. I used to doordash on the side too, so I feel like I understand both sides. It\u2019s the easiest thing to do just to check if an order is ready. The first two times I\u2019d assume the kitchen was backed up and they didn\u2019t start the order until the driver arrived. Almost a hour though? That\u2019s way too long. You didn\u2019t even really snap, just told her that she had you (and the food getting bad) for almost a hour for no good reason.", "Ask Jerry Seinfeld, he did an entire episode on this.", "NTA\n\nShe actually didn't do her job, and you were far more patient than you needed to be. \nIronically, if you'd been a jerk and insisted she double check or asked for the manager etc, without being patient, you'd have gotten your order on time. \ud83d\ude36", "NTA, you gave her opportunity to do her job with the upmost understanding. She failed to do anything until you decided you had enough of being sent in circles. The industry gets a lot of A-holes as customers but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t get a lot of a-holes as workers either.", "NTA\n\nTbh I'd report her to higher management. Someone like that is going to cause issues for the entire restaurant. A lot of innocent people are going to end up screamed at because of her.", "This is a very bad AITA post. It\u2019s boring, the answer is obvious, and there barely seems to be any conflict for even OP whether or not they could be the asshole. Downvoted. NTA.", "ESH but goodness, do what every other delivery driver does- pick up another order while you\u2019re waiting. \n\nAn entire hour? This is just as much your fault as hers at that point.", "I once went to get cheap pizza from a place that has the automated warmer ovens and give you a code for pickup. Waited, waited... waited... no email saying it was done. Waited. After about 30-40 minutes I get in line and finally get to the front and the last looks for my order and pulls out our of the back warmers behind the counter. I had been watching and had seen it in there for a long time but you can't see your name or anything, I just assumed those were hot n ready like the rest in there were...\n\nI asked if they'd been waiting there for 30 minutes, we look at the receipt, yes they had.  I asked for them to be remade because it's already cheap pizza and the best time to eat it is when it's almost gong to burn your mouth, the extra cheese is the best thing on those abs it's not with the calories when it's rubber.. \n\nShe acted like it was my fault I didn't ask earlier- and said i should have known it would be waiting in the back cabinet... like what? when the whole point of the automated thing is to just see your name or the email that is done, put in the code and get your fresh pizza. I told her there's NO WAY I would have known to ask sooner because all the instructions say is to wait for the conf or your name to be on the board, etc, and finally about 15 minutes after est ready time is when I finally asked. They finally remade it but the fact she thought I should know to ask BEFORE the estimate time or before my name pops up without it saying anywhere to do that... oh well", "Cost more than time but also money and possibly a poor rating.", "NTA\n\nI've had my ticket get lost on the floor. After 20 minutes, the woman at the counter went back, looked, found it, apologized profusely, and stuck my order in to be made next. Accidents happen, and I'd rather the freshly made food that hasn't been sitting out for ages.\n\nAccidents are accidents and can be fixed and forgiven. Incompetence is a different story.\n\nOP didn't seem harsh, just truthful. The actions of the hostess show that she knew she screwed up, and hopefully she learned from it.", "I have had drivers text me to tell me that the food wasn\u2019t ready when they arrived and sent me updates until they got the actual food.  I\u2019m sure that way they didn\u2019t get blamed but I appreciated knowing where to lay responsibility and wouldn\u2019t rate them poorly when the food didn\u2019t arrive when expected.", "And you just know that if you had done that she would\u2019ve told you to wait for the confirmation.", "I mean, that one was your fault.", "As someone who did delivery in the past, that's exactly why. If your food is 30 minutes late because I had to wait forever at the restaurant, I want you to know I'm not the roadblock in that situation.", "I understood and appreciated it plus when I get a request/text from the app to rate it I can assign the proper rating to the right party"]}
