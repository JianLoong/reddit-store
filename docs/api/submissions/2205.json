Before I tell this story I have worked customer service a lot and this hostess was the first customer service worker I have ever snapped at.\n\nSo I had an order for pick up at a local italian restaurant. I got to the restaurant a little early, checked if the order was ready and the hostess said no, but it should be about ten minutes. I thanked her, sat down down and played on my phone during the wait, and even gave them an extra few minutes. Finally i got up and asked about the order. Hostess once again told me \u201cabout ten minutes\u201d. I was slightly annoyed that fifteen minutes after being told ten minutes I was again told it would be ten minutes, but shit happens, I get it. I sat down and again waited fifteen minutes. Finally I went go the hostess again and asked about the order, to which she told me it was almost done and they will bag it up shortly. Once again I sat down and waited, now kicking myself for not just dropping the order and moving on. Again I waited over ten minutes. Finally I asked the hostess AGAIN about the order and surprise surprise, it was going to be a few more minutes. I was pretty annoyed by this point and without thinking I just blurted out \u201cDid you actually check or are you just saying that again?\u201d She gave me a look like I was being unreasonable so I explained to her that I had been waiting for almost an hour because she kept saying it was almost ready. She looked exasperated but said she would go check on it. The kicker is that I watched her go behind the bar to check for it, she came back empty handed, and than pulled it the order out from the behind her counter\u2026 meaning it had been ready. She handed it to me without looking at me or saying anything, no apology, just a curt nod and that was it\u2026. Im not necessarily proud of this next part, but I told her that she had just wasted almost an hour of my time and to maybe consider checking before telling people it wasn\u2019t ready in future.\n\nJust to be clear, the restaurant was not overly busy, and even if it had been I can forgive a kitchen being backed up, it happens. I feel weird about snapping at a customer service worker but cant help but also feel slightly justified since she apparently had the order for a while and just had not bothered to check.

She was asleep on the job which cost you much time. And you did not snap at her. You defied her canned responses and  that was a perfectly reasonable response to the nonsense she imposed on you . You rightly forced her to face the issue.  She should have apologized to you.", "NTA\n\nAfter reading the title, I was all ready to tell you to chill and it's not her fault the place got slammed or the kitchen fucked up, or whatever.... but yeah, no.

I had a hostess pull this trick on me at a relatively expensive seafood restaurant. Didn\u2019t look for order for 30 minutes but it was ready the whole time.", "NTA. You were a lot nicer to her than almost anyone else would have been. No one wants cold food because an employee is not doing their job and simply paying attention. Hopefully she changes her ways, because the next person she does that to may not be so kind.", "NTA.  Gives customer service workers a bad name.", "NTA, I get why this happens, but it doesn't excuse it.\n\nI'd often turn off about 80-90% of my mind at work too, but you gotta remember to at least keep enough of your mind on.

With what you are doing time is money and that hostess wasted your time.\n\nShe should have checked with the kitchen.  Orders go missing, fall on the floor, etc and so on.

Kept giving me the run around and I finally snapped and told the hostess (after waiting for over 1.5hr and she refusing to cancel my order), that her not checking was ridiculous. I told her to check as one CSR to another, she needs to get herself in gear bc a front of house takes the hit, and to get correct information when presented with a problem. Saying \u201c15 mins more\u201d 2-3 times is a joke and a quick way to make someone angry. \n\nHonestly I haven\u2019t ordered from there again.\n\nAre you able to leave a comment on what occurred to the person who ordered?
