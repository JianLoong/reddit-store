So I met this woman (34 at the time, call her Jess) when I was 28. My Brother Kurt (24) also worked with us, he's a married man at this point. \n \nHer and I started sleeping with each other with no real crazy strings attached, but certain agreements none the less. If you're sleeping with other people let me know, etc. Including a rule that she made, stating she'd never sleep with my brother.\n \nWell, a few months pass, and it's my birthday so I threw a party at my house. Weirdly, Jess, my brother, and my brothers wife didn't show up and didn't answer any of my messages. Wouldn't you know it, Kurt was cheating on his wife with Jess.\n \nNot only did this create a tumultuous relationship with my brother, but I had to uproot my work environment for a new place, new friends (Jess lied and told people we never did anything together, so they thought I was the jerk). Then my parents even got involved and begged me, knowing what he did, to allow him to stay with me after his wife threw him out.\n \nThen Jess and Kurt get married! So now she's my SIL. And in the four plus years she's never apologized, Kurt isn't the greatest there either. They have also never even attempted to be an aunt or uncle to their only nephew. In 4+ years I think they bought him 1 present, maybe 2. They've never asked to visit, planned a day with him, or even Facetimed to say hi, in 4 years.\n    \nNow, she sends me an email out of the blue, only after I've been saying for years how batshit insane this all is, to apologize to me. She didn't even spell my wife's name right in the email, nor acknowledge her lack of even attempting to act like an aunt or a family member. And I'm 100 percent certain her parents and family don't actually know the real story, and they've reached out to invite me to places. Including ruining our families Christmas with my parents by flying in and my parents even chose to go over there, instead of being with their only grandson. \n \nAITA for not supporting their marriage, attempts to have children, or general want for them to be around as a \"family\" in a way that could directly affect my families life?", "created_utc": 1677077489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1191m2n/aita_sil_wants_to_apologize_4_years_later/", "score": 1426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's actually your parents loss.\n\nYou owe your parents nothing and you owe your brother less.\n\nBut your SIL wants something from you but just hasn't said it yet.", "Definitely NTA, but I suggest forgiving them anyways if you haven't already (you don't even have to tell them you forgive them). That doesn't mean you have hang out with them or believe the things they say, but I bet it will be a big weight off your shoulders if you do.", "It's the equivalent of 'this is definitely my last cookie of the day...' as you reach into the packet for a cookie that is not your last cookie. Putting the cookies back in the pantry and saying 'there are no cookies to be had' is the way to go.", "\u201cMarried brother\u201d", "Maybe she settled for the wrong brother. NTA", "As per him they're aware since they begged OP to let his brother stay with him after being kicked out by his wife while the parents knowing the full story... Looks like someone's the favorite/golden child and it's not OP", "Yes I was also confused about the timeline! How were you having a baby at the same time this was going down, OP?", "I forgave them a long time ago. But I definitely don't want them in my life, and I guess they don't like that?", "I was thinking.... she is pregnant and want a better treatment for their kid then what they do to their nephew.", "I can't upvote this enough", "I'm like half sure the whole thing is a half assed attempt at \"can't you just apologize to him so we don't have to choose you so obviously\".\n\nIt's a win win for the cheaters. Either he accepts the apology and they're golden, or he doesn't and that makes it all his fault.", "Yeah please give us an update whenever you find out what it is! I have a feeling another shoe is about to drop.", "Does that mean I need to start saying \"Right off the bact\"?", "Ah; excuse me while I remove this foot.  I seem to have gotten you mixed up with someone else, except for the FWB; I did understand that bit. Sorry for the mix up. My badly tempered point is that they were friends and he had a reasonable expectation of trust.\n\nBut, I think the point you're really trying to make is that OP doesn't need her for any closure; and advising t OP  to take radical ownership; minus the shame, for the good of their mental health?  Then I agree.", "Cheating does indeed have a broader meaning than sleeping with others, ever heard of people cheating on tests or cheating at games?\n\nYou can have an open relationship with someone, but if person A is designated as off limits, but then you sleep with person A then you are, in fact, cheating.  Because you are not following the agreed upon parameter of the relationship.  Such as what Jess did here.\n\nIt's easy to make someone appear as creepy and stalkerish, and often that can be seen worse than being a cheater.  If he was upset over the deception and affair (between brother, SIL, and Jess) this likely would have been noticeable at work.  People might wonder why he was so invested in his brother's relationships.  Without that bit of information that she was also involved with OP it can make him look like a jealous, stalker, creep who is obsessed with Jess.  Which would cause issues.\n\nJess owes him an apology for lying to him about sleeping with his brother, about lying to others about the true nature of her relationship with OP, and more if she truly wants to make amends.  Also,  knowing the BIL's wife's name is a good start to make amends.", "No worries, I appreciate the candor.\n\n\nI'd say my main point is that bad things (the friend) happen to good people (OP), and learning to cope with that for the benefit of your mental health and future is unfortunately a reality of life.  OP was absolutely wronged but in my opinion being NTA solves nothing in this story.\n\n\nWe may disagree, and that's fine. In my view she blew up his month or even year, but even if just for his mental health the rest of his life can't be the responsibility of this (admittedly shitty) ex-\"friend,\" and I feel like he's trying to make that the case."]}
