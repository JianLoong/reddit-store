So I met this woman (34 at the time, call her Jess) when I was 28. My Brother Kurt (24) also worked with us, he's a married man at this point. \n \nHer and I started sleeping with each other with no real crazy strings attached, but certain agreements none the less. If you're sleeping with other people let me know, etc. Including a rule that she made, stating she'd never sleep with my brother.\n \nWell, a few months pass, and it's my birthday so I threw a party at my house. Weirdly, Jess, my brother, and my brothers wife didn't show up and didn't answer any of my messages. Wouldn't you know it, Kurt was cheating on his wife with Jess.\n \nNot only did this create a tumultuous relationship with my brother, but I had to uproot my work environment for a new place, new friends (Jess lied and told people we never did anything together, so they thought I was the jerk). Then my parents even got involved and begged me, knowing what he did, to allow him to stay with me after his wife threw him out.\n \nThen Jess and Kurt get married! So now she's my SIL. And in the four plus years she's never apologized, Kurt isn't the greatest there either. They have also never even attempted to be an aunt or uncle to their only nephew. In 4+ years I think they bought him 1 present, maybe 2. They've never asked to visit, planned a day with him, or even Facetimed to say hi, in 4 years.\n    \nNow, she sends me an email out of the blue, only after I've been saying for years how batshit insane this all is, to apologize to me. She didn't even spell my wife's name right in the email, nor acknowledge her lack of even attempting to act like an aunt or a family member. And I'm 100 percent certain her parents and family don't actually know the real story, and they've reached out to invite me to places. Including ruining our families Christmas with my parents by flying in and my parents even chose to go over there, instead of being with their only grandson. \n \nAITA for not supporting their marriage, attempts to have children, or general want for them to be around as a \"family\" in a way that could directly affect my families life?", "created_utc": 1677077489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1191m2n/aita_sil_wants_to_apologize_4_years_later/", "score": 612, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are being a hypocrite.", "Nta, I'm of the mind that actions speak louder than words, and every one of your SILs actions speaks very clearly. Personally I would limit the families exposure to people like her and your brother, cause at best it's continued indifference, at worst it's manipulations and toxicity.", "[removed]", "NTA you owe her nothing. I wonder what they want.", "NTA. Get her to apologize in person and secretly record her admitting what she did so that you can send it to the people who didn\u2019t believe. Then laugh and tell her to get the hell out.", "NTA.\n\nI don't really care what the reason is that they are reaching out now, you are not obligated to accept the apology. The only people they really need to make their peace with is whatever Deity they believe in.  I am sorry you were put through so much betrayal but I hope you are now surrounded by an amazing family of your own, and friends who you value. You don't need this relationship- you can forgive someone without letting them back in your life.   \n\n\nIf however you do decide to hear them out and accept the apology, (and they are truly sincere and do the work to be better) you will truly have to learn to move past it and that's the hard part. You would be TA if you said you accepted it, and then continued to lord it over them.", "NTA but why would you want them in your life or that of your child and wife? Seriously you're way better off without them and their minions.", "NTA. Please update us when you find out what they want.", "NTA. But only you can judge what she meant to you at the time. Did your brother know you were intimate or was he in the dark when he slept with her? If he was in the dark, it may be worth having a one on one with him over a beer or twelve.  Something is going down between them or with one of them.  You haven't seen them for four years because they are embarrassed. If she really didn't mean that much to you and if she is willing to come clean to your Brother, Parents, Wife and friends, then I'd consider laying that ghost to rest.  But if it's a a secret apology between the two of you, then it's not worth the paper it was written on.  Unless it's in her handwriting and you post it online knowing you are pulling the pin on that particular grenade.\n\nIf she were out of the picture, I'd say don't give up on your Brother.  I still have a very good friend who dated a girl for a couple of years who I subsequently dated six months after they broke up.  It was a bumpy road for a few years, but I always tried to take anything she said about him after the fact with a grain of salt, and she didn't say too much.  Just that she was young. Women make you crazy sometimes.  Pass the BeerNuts.", "**NTA**    There has probably been pressure to \"do something\" to paper over the rift.\n\nI'd recommend sending a response, copied to both sets of parents and your brother, that states how their betrayal (and get specific) affected you and point out that the rift she created -- and their refusal to acknowledge  your hurt -- has profoundly affected your child's relationship with his extended family to the extent that his own grandparents have marginalized him.   I would also be sure to underline the correct spelling of your wife's name in the note.", "Reply \u201cI don\u2019t know you\u201d and block", "NTA!! you can go NC with them if you choose", "INFO what did she apologize for? Just for sleeping with your brother, or what? \n\nI would say you should accept the apology if it will stop the family division, but if she's not trying to actually make amends for not being a good family member, she probably wants money, but it's hard to tell until she reveals her true motive.", "I just want to know if it\u2019s known to you, OP, that Kurt is your parents\u2019 favorite child. Because that\u2019s one reason I can think of why your parents will choose to go to Kurt and Jess for Christmas, instead of spending time w/ your son. \n\nI think that, in your choice to not support Kurt and Jess, you\u2019re also going to have to come to terms with losing some of your family members - including your parents, by how it all looks like. It sucks but I\u2019m in that boat as well: my SO\u2019s family favors a different sibling, so they\u2019re always going to rally to that sibling.  Everyone else - yes, including those very siblings that rally to that One Golden Sibling - is left to their devices to figure shit out, no help.", ">Including ruining our families Christmas with my parents by flying in and my parents even chose to go over there, instead of being with their only grandson.\n\nThis part is odd to me.  If this woman is so terrible and OP's situation is so righteous, why would parent's opt to leave OP for christmas?  Why would OP need to uproot their entire life and find new friends over a he-said she-said?\n\nThat and the insistence that SIL is \"supposed to be\" this engaged aunt to OPs kid.\n\nSomething is missing.", "Irrelevant to the content of your post, but FYI for anyone the word here is tack, not tact.
