So I met this woman (34 at the time, call her Jess) when I was 28. My Brother Kurt (24) also worked with us, he's a married man at this point. \n \nHer and I started sleeping with each other with no real crazy strings attached, but certain agreements none the less. If you're sleeping with other people let me know, etc. Including a rule that she made, stating she'd never sleep with my brother.\n \nWell, a few months pass, and it's my birthday so I threw a party at my house. Weirdly, Jess, my brother, and my brothers wife didn't show up and didn't answer any of my messages. Wouldn't you know it, Kurt was cheating on his wife with Jess.\n \nNot only did this create a tumultuous relationship with my brother, but I had to uproot my work environment for a new place, new friends (Jess lied and told people we never did anything together, so they thought I was the jerk). Then my parents even got involved and begged me, knowing what he did, to allow him to stay with me after his wife threw him out.\n \nThen Jess and Kurt get married! So now she's my SIL. And in the four plus years she's never apologized, Kurt isn't the greatest there either. They have also never even attempted to be an aunt or uncle to their only nephew. In 4+ years I think they bought him 1 present, maybe 2. They've never asked to visit, planned a day with him, or even Facetimed to say hi, in 4 years.\n    \nNow, she sends me an email out of the blue, only after I've been saying for years how batshit insane this all is, to apologize to me. She didn't even spell my wife's name right in the email, nor acknowledge her lack of even attempting to act like an aunt or a family member. And I'm 100 percent certain her parents and family don't actually know the real story, and they've reached out to invite me to places. Including ruining our families Christmas with my parents by flying in and my parents even chose to go over there, instead of being with their only grandson. \n \nAITA for not supporting their marriage, attempts to have children, or general want for them to be around as a \"family\" in a way that could directly affect my families life?", "created_utc": 1677077489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1191m2n/aita_sil_wants_to_apologize_4_years_later/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are they aware of this mess?", "NTA\n\nYour SIL's apology was as genuine as a 3 dollar bill.  For crying out loud, she couldn't be bothered to spell your wife's name correctly.  From what you said here, she's taken **no** real concrete actions to **SHOW** regret.\n\nSuch as actively work with her family to restore your reputation.  Or come clean about exactly what happened.

She never told him she was sleeping with his brother behind the wife's back, after OP and her both agreed to let the other person know if they had additional sexual partners (probs for health reasons).

I suppose in your books he shouldn't be bitter about that either?", "She's the one that spread lies and told people.", "She has no obligation to tell her coworkers about her sex life!", "So OP is at fault for trying to clear his name from her lies and getting everyone to hate him?
