I took allergy shots for 3 years and a daily allergy pill. Allergies are to the dander, not saliva. She just doesn't like your dog. You have to make your decision which it sounds like you have. \n\nAs long as it's a good home where you know he will live out his life happily, NTA. \n\nIf you send him to shelter, YTA. \n\nBtw, your wife's manipulation of the situation makes her an AH in my book.", "NTA. And I\u2019m a huuuge dog advocate who\u2019s fostered over 50 dogs. Just do it the right way. Find him an even better home than you give him.

You cant have mine but I highly recommend the breed!", "NTA. Dog allergies are from the dander, NOT the mouth or hair or whatever she says. Claritin works wonders, and if she\u2019s still having a difficult time she could be prescribed a nasal spray.", "NAH, but I still feel bad for your dog.

My brother is super deathly allergic to cats. Like just bad. Amd I know the pain. Your wife has been a trooper by keeping the dog. But if she is in pain bc of allergies, I would say find a new loving home for your dog with ability to always have contact with him.  I re homed my 2 dogs and a cat after my brother was dying from the animals at home. I re homed in 2011. My last dog just passed away 1 week ago. I kept contact with the families and I got pics and everything of my loved pets. But I put family (humans) first. \n\nSo no NTA", "NTA \nI am also allergic to animals. I can relate that I would never ask my partner to give a dog away. If you have an animal, then you are responsible for it. But I also would neither move together nor marry a man when I am allergic to his dog. I am astonished that your wife has tolerated this situation for so long.\n\nSo I would also try to rehome him.", "YWNBTA. Your wife, a human person is suffering. Find the dog a good home and let your wife enjoy life.", "YTA\nAll this dog knows is you. When you get a pet you make a commitment to be it\u2019s caretaker and family and do right by them- not just until it\u2019s inconvenient. \nTry to find a place with more room if this is part of the issue. Perhaps a friend or family member can help out with them until you can get the space situation sorted. Get air filters- they can help SIGNIFICANTLY with allergens. Talk to your vet about whether your dog needs a dental cleaning as this is often a source of foul breath especially in bulldogs. Ear infections and facial fold debris and general skin issues on such hot-mess breeds can also be very stinky so they may be able to help resolve some of it. Talk to her about allergy med options. Use couch covers you can easily wash, get rid of carpets and other unnecessary soft surfaces which harbor allergens.  \nI know it\u2019s tough and not a situation any of us want to find ourselves in, but there are lots of options to try before rehoming. At the end of the day the dog deserves a home with folks who want to be with him and the situation needs to be liveable, but there\u2019s a lot to consider", "I've adopted two adult dogs over the years, and they adapted faster to their new home than the puppies I've bought. Don't feel guilty about rehoming the dog if you find a good family for him, but be upfront about any issues the dog may have and have a trial period of a couple of weeks in case it proves to be a bad match. \n\nHowever, allergies like this is typically due to dander, not smell. YWBTA if you don't pop in at the doctor's office to confirm that your wife is actually allergic to the dog before you make a decision. It could be something else that's causing her symptoms and/or she might be able to get allergy pills. Or it's just that she doesn't like your dog and knows that \"I hate his smell\" isn't going to change anything. Either way, unless you don't want to keep the dog for your own reasons, get her an allergy test.", "This is weird to me.  My husband had a cat when we started dating.  I'm allergic to cats.  I got allergy shots, I take zyrtec and fluticasone. \nI would NEVER have wanted my husband to have to give up his beloved pet. Has she even tried these things.  Why did she marry you? It's not like you adopted the dog against her wishes after you were married.  \nAlso,  for everyone saying allergens only come from dander that is incorrect.  \n\nFrom the mayo clinic: \n\"Cats and dogs\n\nAllergens from cats and dogs are found in skin cells the animals shed (dander), as well as in their saliva, urine and sweat and on their fur. Dander is a particular problem because it is very small and can remain airborne for long periods of time with the slightest bit of air circulation. It also collects easily in upholstered furniture and sticks to your clothes.\n\nPet saliva can stick to carpets, bedding, furniture and clothing. Dried saliva can become airborne.\"", "NAH, it's a tough situation and no one sounds especially insensitive here.\n\nI love animals and usually come down pretty hard on people for rehoming pets out of convenience, so I hope my NAH is worth something here.\n\nI think you should try a combination of Claritin and air purifiers and see how much that helps. Sometimes it doesn't make a dent in the problem, but sometimes it works miracles, so you never know.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I'd also think real hard about options for getting back into a place with more space. You said she works from home - is it possible for you to also work remotely, and perhaps move to a cheaper area?\n\nIf those options don't work, then the only option left is to rehome. You're not an AH if you're doing it as an absolute last resort. Just make sure the dog goes to a loving family you've vetted and that you trust, please don't hand him over to a shelter.", "If she knew she was allergic, why did you both keep seeing each other? And if she knew she was allergic to the dog, why would she decide to live with you? Truly sounds like this may be a test on her part. She wins and knows she can control you if you get rid of the dog. If you leave her for the dog, then she knows you were not worthy of her. Just cause she doesn't say anything about the dog, she still could be testing you to see if you will do the right thing for her.", "ESH.  Your wife is an AH for not being upfront about her allergies or dealing with them before you got married.  You are an AH if you give up your dog because it is your dog; it has bonded to you.  \n\nYou are a package deal with your dog; tossing her aside is never right, and if your wife is okay with this, there is something very wrong with her.", "Came to say the same.
