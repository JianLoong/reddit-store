She has provided me with emotional support, a shoulder to cry on, and amazing advice. She's also bailed me out of some tough financial situations. As such, I try to be there for her just as much as she has for me. She lives in a different part of the state so we don't see or talk to each other often, but we're both a phone call away. \n\nBecause I'm bad with dates, I sent her a happy birthday three days later that her actual birthday. I was supremely embarrassed and angry with myself that I totally spaced out. She didn't mind and said it actually helped extend it, but I told her that was unacceptable and that I would make it up to her. So I got her a beautiful Burberry scarf as a birthday present. The present was a long time coming. She loves high quality things although she'd never buy stuff for herself or expect anyone to buy it for her. Plus she's been going through some physical health challenges and she's been feeling very down lately. So I decided to get her something to match her inner beauty. \n\nMy girlfriend(28f), was pissed at me. She said that it was far too expensive just to get for a friend and the money would have been far better used someplace else. And such an extravagant gift might lead people to believe that I had feelings for her. I feel like that's complete garbage. I'm very financially secure and we have separate finances, I can afford a splurge on myself or loved ones every now and then. Plus gift giving is my love language, my girlfriend is the usual beneficiary of this. She even told me it was like being together with Santa Claus. Plus she's my best friend, I have no feelings towards her other than platonic love and vice versa. And did I mention that she's happily married and obsessed with her husband? \n\nI told my girlfriend she was being ridiculous and getting jealous for no reason. She said that if I couldn't see the problem with this, then it wasn't worth talking about. My gf has never shown any jealousy towards my best friend before, and I told her what the deal was with her from day one. So this is pretty much came out of nowhere. \n\nSo reddit, although I don't think I'm the ahole, I just need to know if is there is something here that would make me the ahole?", "created_utc": 1667239833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yijspi/aita_for_buying_my_best_friend_a_burberry_scarf/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But as this is not the case..", "Your girlfriend does realize Santa Claus' whole schtick is giving gifts to everyone on earth, right? Like, those elves aren't just working on things for Mrs. Claus so she can feel secure in her relationship.\n\nNTA.", "NTA! What a wonderful thoughtful gift. I love how you describe your friendship, she totally deserves a lovely present. She also lives far away from you. And your GF describes you as a live in Santa! She knows you\u2019re a giving person!! No reason to get jealous at all.", "NTA. It\u2019s very generous of you. \n\nIf I had to hazard a guess, I\u2019d say your GF thinks that money should\u2019ve been spent on her. \n\nEdit: It almost feels like your GF sees your gifts as things she entitled to - hence the jealousy.", "NTA Apparently gf only likes your gift giving when you're giving gifts to her! You're not allowed to give them to anybody else or it makes her jealous. Seems like she's the type to think \"If you're spending money on gifts I should be getting those gifts!\"", "NTA. She's your friend. You gf knows she's your friend. It was a gift that you can afford. No casualties here. Gf doesn't get to say that it's too much unless she's insinuating something else. Why would it make anyone think that there's more going on? She knows you're friends. Presumably your friend's husband knows that you're friends and doesn't mind. So why would anyone else think anything untoward? And even if they do, so what?", "NTA. It's your money. You decide how and who to spend it on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you were showering your friend with expensive gifts and things like that every day it would have been a different story. You were just trying to make your friend's birthday special. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople need to understand that there can be platonic relationships between females and males. Your girlfriend being one of them.", "You absolutely have feelings for her, they just aren\u2019t romantic ones! It\u2019s great when you can splurge on a gift for a loved one, that they wouldn\u2019t treat themselves to normally. I guess she doesn\u2019t want Santa to spread the love. If money was tight or you gave her crappy gifts I could understand her jealousy but alas that is not the case. \n\nNTA!", "NTA - nah she\u2019s just mad she didn\u2019t  get the scarf.", "Money be more useful towards something * else...\n\n*someone else and that someone is her.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you did something nice for a friend, nothing bad about that, especially if it\u2019s within your budget to do so. I do wonder though, do you buy nice things like that for your girlfriend? That\u2019s the only way I could see it slipping into the AH territory is if you don\u2019t buy luxury gifts for your gf and she sees you doing it for another woman, even if it\u2019s just a friend situation.", "NTA - This person is a dear invaluable friend. A person you love. Also, you are financially secured, have separate finances and, \"...can afford a splurge on myself or loved ones.\"  Your life will grow very small if you do not nurture the ones you love and those who love you back. Best to you.", "NTA - what a lovely present. Honestly they are a spurge but they last forever and are not obscenely expensive especially the wool blends versus pure cashmere.\n\nYour GF is jealous of your relationship with your friend. Yes indeed the money would have been better spent someplace else in her words which means spent on her.\n\nThis is not a pretty look and while it isn't a reason to break up, it certainly would give me pause to think about whether this is a pattern and whether it might escalate in terms of control and jealousy when you are nailed down and married.", "NTA, tell her there are easier ways to communicate that she would also like a Burberry scarf than by getting shitty about you getting one for someone else.", "NTA. But I am wondering if your girlfriend thought the money should have been spent on her instead. Does she expect gifts? I hope she is not upset because she feels entitled to your money.", "See, if this was like, you got your girlfriend a cheaper gift for her birthday, and then an expensive scarf for your friend, I could understand her being upset.\n\nBut a one-off gift, which you can afford, and where your girlfriend is *very* aware already of how much you enjoy using your spending money to gift people you care about?\n\nDoes seem a bit oddly insecure of her.\n\nI'm reluctant to call her an asshole - there's a difference between being insecure and being an asshole - so in the absence of any further information on where her thought processes are coming from, NAH.\n\nYour friend's definitely lucky to have you as a supportive friend.", "NAH. I can understand your girlfriend feeling jealous but it sounds like you guys talked it over and everything is ok. As long as you're giving your gf the same attention, all is good!", "NTA.\n\nBreak up with your girlfriend, not because you're bored but because she has work to do on her own.", "NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend isn't worried about the money, or that someone \"might think\" got have romantic feelings for your friend. She thinks you do. She's not jealous of the scarf, she's feeling threatened.\n\nYou might be able to reassure her with an open conversation. Or this may be when you find out your gf isn't mature enough for an adult relationship.", "Info: how expensive is this scarf? A scarf seems like a reasonable gift to me", "NTA You have a  long-standing verifiable platonic friendship with this woman.\nWhile expensive gifting can cause others to question the relationship, your girlfriend is not your wife and ultimately has little say in how you spend your extra money  I  curious what your friends spouses reaction was to the gift \nBUT YOU CLEARLY STATED GIFT GIVING IS YOUR WAY OF SHOWING APPRECIATION. ot shouldn't have been a shock to your girlfriend", "NTA! Your GF knew if the relationship way before hand. A long time ago my husband bought a card and flowers for an employee for Mother\u2019s Day because she was sad she didn\u2019t have her kid with her (she got it taken away from her). He has a heart of gold and wears it on his sleeve. I told him you can\u2019t do that unless you do it for all of your employees it looks bad and can give the wrong impression. I\u2019m saying this only because to others it can give the wrong idea. For some reason your gf is right in one sense but she knew of the past with your friend and there shouldn\u2019t have been an issue. Your gf may feel a little jealous in my book.", "NTA  \nPerhaps when your GF is your wife things will be easier.
