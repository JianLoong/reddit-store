I'm not sure why your brother is so angry. You have every right to buy things second hand. It's nice, when he is worried about you, but he could have asked in the first place.

If you would be struggling, you wouldn't have a phone or just a Huawei.", "There's nothing wrong with simplicity, not getting a fancy car or the newest phone whenever it's released. If that's the only reason he thinks that you're poor, then NTA. You never \"made yourself look poor\", you just don't care as much about materialistic things as he does. \n\nWhat confuses me is the fact that he states he was worried for you being poor. Is there a reason he's had to worry about your financial situation? (For example: you were doing very bad financially for a while and never informed him you're doing better now)\n\nEDIT: Just read another comment that suggested the brother might have wanted you to send him money /freeload on your salary. That is indeed the only way his anger would make sense..", "NTA.\n\nI have no idea what your brother is on about.   Do you think that if your brother had known about your salary, he'd have expected you to give money to him?   That's the only way this makes sense.\n\nWorrying about somebody who has a working car, an apartment, and an old phone seems intrusive to me.  It's weird to be judging somebody else on how they spend their money.\n\nThat said, you're allowed to spend money now. If you buy [insert luxury], it won't keep you from eating or paying the rent.  It's sensible to have savings, but you don't have to save all your money for a rainy day.", "NTA\n\nHe's furious because you didn't boast to him about your salary? Huh? It's not like he was sending you money for support thinking it's necessary and then, hah-HAH, you were just conning him.", "Info:  Has he ever helped you out financially thinking you needed it?", "NTA.

You don't feel that you do now or ever did have any obligation to tell him about your personal finances, nor do you care to know about his.

If you are out earning him he may have lashed out at the surprise.\n\nThat said you do you. Any issues he has with how you spend your money is on him.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think that is really why your brother is mad, either. If he was so worried about your finances, why didn\u2019t he ever talk to you about it?", "I am curious, did your brother ever express his worry for you vocally or through actions like giving you money or gifts, maybe buying you things - groceries, household items, or even little luxuries that people may not buy themselves because they can only afford life\u2019s necessities.", "NTA. I agree, who the fuck cares. If you're happy being minimalist then that's all that matters. Your brother needs to find other stuff to worry about and if it was such a concern, why didn't he inquire into your wellbeing?", "NTA. If he was worried about you, he could have talked to you and you would have reassured him that you have everything you need.

You brother uhhhh, I don't know, could have actually talked to you if he had concerns.", "NTA, you are choosing to live life how you please. There is nothing wrong with choosing to live in a minimalistic way. If you are happy that's what is important. I suspect he is angry for several reasons. It could be he thought your poor financial system reflected badly on him, that he maybe was hoping if you had that much money that you would help him out or get things for him. It could be a similar thing to your being ashamed of being poor and him being angry about that. It genuinely could be out of a degree of concern. In which he thought you were struggling and was worried about how you were doing in life and he just didn't process the emotions well or in an adult fashion. There are probably a few that I have missed on reasons but your NTA and you won't really know why this is an issue unless you talk to him about it.", "NTA. It\u2019s weird that he is this worried about it. Why has he been \u201cstressed out\u201d about it? So strange.

So, I appreciate how you view things.\n\nNo one else on earth is entitled to spend your money for you - no matter their very real needs. I remember being forced to buy a new car because keeping the old one running monthly was like a car payment anyway. I also remember my very real anxiety and sleepless nights about feeling over extended. So, I feel for your brother's predicament, but, you aren't responsible for his anxieties, his needs, or his ideas about how you *should be* living. I don't regret wasting time much anymore. But, I never feel good about wasting money. Whatever it is I invest in - it has to feel like a worthwhile expense to me. (And I treat myself often enough. I just never learned to play around with my money. I remember all too well when I had NONE.)", "NTA. Your brother might be jealous, or upset you haven\u2019t been spending your money on him. Clearly you\u2019ve done nothing wrong here.", "NTA. Your brother is manipulated by society and social media. You should be showing everything to everyone every chance you get. Flex your wealth all the damn time.\n\nI have a used car, old (ish) phone, haven't bought new clothes in 3-4 years, and get my hair cut once every 2-3 months.\n\nSome people finance fancy cars, have the newest flagship phones, buy clothes almost every weekend, and get their hair cut every week or biweekly.\n\nIt's insane.\n\nDon't worry about it though.", "NTA. People think they can tell who is rich or not based on the things they buy.  That belief is constantly reinforced through ads telling you people will think this and that about you if you buy the right status symbols.  But in reality, it's all bullshit.

It's not like you're asking him for money.", "YTA if your brother has expressed his concern to you and you did nothing to let him know you're financially stable.

Every country is different and it's well known that Germany is behind with all technology stuff. All phones I had were passed down by family members or friends.

It may have kept him up at night or otherwise caused a lot of fear at whether he was going to (and if he was able to) pull OP out of a financial hole if things went really bad.

If it wasn\u2019t for his sacrifice, his family would never have gotten out of poverty. His sister has thankfully been grateful and helped him a bit when she became a doctor.

She worked at a very manual-labor type job for about 30 years and had saved up like half a million dollars, and owned her house outright. The only thing that made me sad was the fact that she barely ever spent money on herself -- even when she really needed something like medical care.

I ask because I wonder if his anger comes more from realizing you\u2019re better off than he is, and you could\u2019ve been helping him all along. If it was really about worrying if you were okay financially he for one would\u2019ve asked in general, and/or offered help.

That said if he suddenly starts asking for help and/or loans, just know that is in fact why he was angry. If that\u2019s the case, you need to set firm boundaries. It\u2019s okay to help, but help doesn\u2019t mean saying how high every time they say jump. He should absolutely be paying you back, and it shouldn\u2019t be a constant thing. More like a rarity in extreme circumstances. All of this aside though, you never actually led on that you were poor. You just never led on that you were wealthy which is a completely different thing.
