I'm not sure why your brother is so angry. You have every right to buy things second hand. It's nice, when he is worried about you, but he could have asked in the first place.

If you would be struggling, you wouldn't have a phone or just a Huawei.", "There's nothing wrong with simplicity, not getting a fancy car or the newest phone whenever it's released. If that's the only reason he thinks that you're poor, then NTA. You never \"made yourself look poor\", you just don't care as much about materialistic things as he does. \n\nWhat confuses me is the fact that he states he was worried for you being poor. Is there a reason he's had to worry about your financial situation? (For example: you were doing very bad financially for a while and never informed him you're doing better now)\n\nEDIT: Just read another comment that suggested the brother might have wanted you to send him money /freeload on your salary. That is indeed the only way his anger would make sense..", "NTA.\n\nI have no idea what your brother is on about.   Do you think that if your brother had known about your salary, he'd have expected you to give money to him?   That's the only way this makes sense.\n\nWorrying about somebody who has a working car, an apartment, and an old phone seems intrusive to me.  It's weird to be judging somebody else on how they spend their money.\n\nThat said, you're allowed to spend money now. If you buy [insert luxury], it won't keep you from eating or paying the rent.  It's sensible to have savings, but you don't have to save all your money for a rainy day.", "NTA\n\nHe's furious because you didn't boast to him about your salary? Huh? It's not like he was sending you money for support thinking it's necessary and then, hah-HAH, you were just conning him.", "Info:  Has he ever helped you out financially thinking you needed it?", "NTA.

You don't feel that you do now or ever did have any obligation to tell him about your personal finances, nor do you care to know about his.

If you are out earning him he may have lashed out at the surprise.\n\nThat said you do you. Any issues he has with how you spend your money is on him.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think that is really why your brother is mad, either. If he was so worried about your finances, why didn\u2019t he ever talk to you about it?", "I am curious, did your brother ever express his worry for you vocally or through actions like giving you money or gifts, maybe buying you things - groceries, household items, or even little luxuries that people may not buy themselves because they can only afford life\u2019s necessities.", "NTA. I agree, who the fuck cares. If you're happy being minimalist then that's all that matters. Your brother needs to find other stuff to worry about and if it was such a concern, why didn't he inquire into your wellbeing?", "NTA. If he was worried about you, he could have talked to you and you would have reassured him that you have everything you need.

You brother uhhhh, I don't know, could have actually talked to you if he had concerns.", "NTA, you are choosing to live life how you please. There is nothing wrong with choosing to live in a minimalistic way. If you are happy that's what is important. I suspect he is angry for several reasons. It could be he thought your poor financial system reflected badly on him, that he maybe was hoping if you had that much money that you would help him out or get things for him. It could be a similar thing to your being ashamed of being poor and him being angry about that. It genuinely could be out of a degree of concern. In which he thought you were struggling and was worried about how you were doing in life and he just didn't process the emotions well or in an adult fashion. There are probably a few that I have missed on reasons but your NTA and you won't really know why this is an issue unless you talk to him about it.", "NTA. It\u2019s weird that he is this worried about it. Why has he been \u201cstressed out\u201d about it? So strange.

So, I appreciate how you view things.\n\nNo one else on earth is entitled to spend your money for you - no matter their very real needs. I remember being forced to buy a new car because keeping the old one running monthly was like a car payment anyway. I also remember my very real anxiety and sleepless nights about feeling over extended. So, I feel for your brother's predicament, but, you aren't responsible for his anxieties, his needs, or his ideas about how you *should be* living. I don't regret wasting time much anymore. But, I never feel good about wasting money. Whatever it is I invest in - it has to feel like a worthwhile expense to me. (And I treat myself often enough. I just never learned to play around with my money. I remember all too well when I had NONE.)", "NTA. Your brother might be jealous, or upset you haven\u2019t been spending your money on him. Clearly you\u2019ve done nothing wrong here.", "NTA. Your brother is manipulated by society and social media. You should be showing everything to everyone every chance you get. Flex your wealth all the damn time.\n\nI have a used car, old (ish) phone, haven't bought new clothes in 3-4 years, and get my hair cut once every 2-3 months.\n\nSome people finance fancy cars, have the newest flagship phones, buy clothes almost every weekend, and get their hair cut every week or biweekly.\n\nIt's insane.\n\nDon't worry about it though.", "NTA. People think they can tell who is rich or not based on the things they buy.  That belief is constantly reinforced through ads telling you people will think this and that about you if you buy the right status symbols.  But in reality, it's all bullshit.

If he was only worried about OP he should have been relieved or happy but mad makes me think he wants some himself, lol.", "Eh, and I just wanna say that poor/homeless people also can't have phones... Nice that all are answering, like this is the USA. I'm still from Germany, we still have one of the worst internet connections. Noone is giving you a phone as a present. Not even all of our schools have internet. I worked with kids for a few years and they used the phones of their parents, because they didn't have anything else. Every country is different and it's well known that Germany is behind with all technology stuff. All phones I had were passed down by family members or friends. I had to move to a big city for a good internet connection and even in my last apartment, my neighbours asked to share the internet, because I was the only one in the house, who had one. The others had to pay extra to get one and surprise, they couldn't pay that...", "Since one has to do so many things over the phone/email, and doing so does not betray you\u2019re homeless, and makes it easy to stay in touch with people when one of you moves, having a smartphone is one of the things that makes being homeless much, much easier. You can frequently charge it and use wifi in libraries. \n\nComputers are much more of a luxury; a smartphone is almost essential.", "I'm from Germany. I talked from the perspective of a person living in Germany. Noone passes down Iphones here. I got my first smartphone from my cousin and all phones me and my siblings have, were passed down by a family member. Having an Iphone is an extravagance here. Same as having a computer. My brother just got a laptop because of corona and he had to fight over it with my other brother.", "I'm from Germany, we don't have such programs... Phones aren't a necessity here. Not even pencils for kids are necessities here.", "Probably, he doesn't really sound like he would be concerned for OP.", "I was super proud of myself back when I saved up money for the Galaxy S3. It was so cool!", "I didn't say that Huawei is bad... I had one myself for years and it's still kind of working most of the time. I meant that a Huawei is better to buy when you are poor, because it doesn't cost much and doesn't break easily. I could drive over mine with a car and it would still be fine. But an Iphone costs as much as a used car and when I got the old one as a present from a friend, because he couldn't resell it, the glass broke within 2 months.", "Exactly !", "Agreed.  I am financially comfortable and could buy a bunch of flashy outfits, but wearing my 5 year old Levi's and ratty band t-shirts is fine by me.", "Who said \"buy buy buy\"?  Not me.", "It would depend on what you define as frivolities.  The things you might call frivolities I might call daily comforts.\n\nIf you decide to save everything that's not spent on essentials until you're 55, then you're putting 30+ years of your life on hold for the sake of a future you may not live to see.", "A sea yacht is luxury no mater how reasonable you are on the rest of your purchases.", "Yeah also I think as a big bro I can see a world where he was still paying for dinners or trying to be helpful assuming OP was poorer than they were", "Op is probably mooching off big bro and now he is mad.", "Yeah, INFO needed- is he gifting her stuff? Money? Always paying the bill if they eat out together?", "Unfortunately this was my first thought. Why else react *angry*, and not just regular surprised?", "Or maybe he is worried for him as a big brother since they are both raised in poverty? The OP and the brother need to communicate more .", "Or maybe the brother worried that he should be helping OP out. Not everyone is greedy.", "If you don't want these \"daily comforts\", it would be a waste to spend money on them.  OP obviously doesn't want this stuff.  If I had all the money in the world my house would be a bungalow in my old neighbourhood, my car I might upgrade to a Prius wagon once the Camry becomes cost inefficient, and my extravagance would be a second pair of Yeti chairs.  Believe it or not, not everyone values materialism.\n\nAnd because my natural inclination is frugality I retired from job as a secretary seven years early, and I missed nothing of significance.", "Yeah, the minimalist that has paid for all their own stuff is probably mooching /s", "He said he owns his apartment and his car. I highly doubt he's been asking brother for help", "There were a lot of possible emotions to have in this situation. Relief, happiness that the OP's life is going better than thought . . . Anger would not be my go-to emotion unless someone had been faking poor in order to get money from me. Which doesn't sound like the situation here.", "Or op been mooching off big bro and now he is mad", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s rational (it\u2019s not) but anger can often show up when something negative turned out to be unnecessary. The brother was apparently very worried for an extended period of time that OP was struggling financially. It may have kept him up at night or otherwise caused a lot of fear at whether he was going to (and if he was able to) pull OP out of a financial hole if things went really bad. Finding out that was unnecessary worry may have switched on the anger. If that\u2019s the case OP will probably get an apology from their brother fairly soon.", "I became disabled in my late 40s.  I'm very grateful that I had traveled to Europe before that happened.", "Good for you.  People are not a monolith and don't all want the same things."]}
