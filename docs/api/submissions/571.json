She lives abt 30min away and it's not easy to hang out often in person. Bc of this, I had no idea she'd started smoking weed regularly til she mentioned it this summer.\n\nLast night, I was invited over to watch a movie. I agreed. I assumed we would be going out to see it in the theater, but it wasn't until we were almost at her apt that I was told we were watching a movie at her apt instead. And also that her roommate and his friend would be there too. When I got to her apt (which is small and has only one window), I was hit with the strong smell of weed. I didn't mention it bc it's none of my business and people smoke all the time in the city. I also figured she was noseblind to it and felt it would be rude/embarrassing to bring it up since there wasn't much she could do.\n\nDuring the movie, her roommate and his friend each took a hit from a homemade gravity bong they'd recently made. They didn't go out onto the fire escape and the smell was strong. This was the first time I met them and no one else was bothered, so I didn't feel like I could complain. It'd been abt 2.5hrs and had a pounding headache. Carly excitedly showed me the bong and wanted me to get close to watch, but I said the smell was giving me a headache, hoping she'd get the hint. She nodded but didn't seem to fully get it. She sat inside to hit it on the windowsill, but bc of how the bong was made, a lot of smoke leaked into the apt and I had to go sit down, dizzy and overwhelmed. This was the first time I'd been exposed to the smoke for a long time and found out it made me feel like shit.\n\nThe bong was hit 3 more times when I was there and for the rest of the night, I felt awful. I had a headache, stomachache, and even though I showered when I got home, it felt like the smell was stuck in my nose, which was nauseating. This morning was the same, plus my heart was pounding, my brain felt really slow, and I was extra anxious for no reason.\n\nI want to be able to prevent this in the future and keep hanging out with Carly. I'm worried that by asking her not to smoke when I'm there, it'll sound like I'm judging her for smoking at all, since I don't smoke or drink (a personal choice, that makes me the \"token straight-edge\" according to her friends). I don't want to be a burden for her or her friends.

I abhor cigarette smoking - and weed is a really stinky version of cigarette smoke.\n\nBut I'm afraid \"their house, their rules\" applies here.\n\n\nWhen your friend invites you over next time just be honest.  Tell her that you prefer to not spend time in her home.  No judgement. You have absolutely no problem with her smoking, but the smell gives you migraines.  You enjoy your time with her, and you don't want it to be punctuated with a headache.\n\nYour friend will either (a) tell her roommate not to smoke while you are around, or (b) will agree to meet and spend time elsewhere.\n\nIf she gets defensive and argumentative - then you came off sounding judgey", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were fine to ask, but they were fine to decline.", "YTA \n\nYou cannot control what other people do in their own homes. Just don't go there and have your friend come to your place. You can definitely tell her why you can't go there, but you can't expect everyone to change for you.", "NAH and you could ask them not to smoke in their own home but don\u2019t be too surprised if they turn you down. It might be best to suggest you meet outside their home because smoke bothers you", "NAH\n\nYou're allowed to ask them not to smoke in your presence for your comfort. They're also allowed to refuse your request.\n\nBut definitely say something.", "NAH. You\u2019re never an AH for requesting an accommodation. You only become one when you become belligerent upon receiving a response you don\u2019t like. Likewise they wouldn\u2019t be an AH for refusing to accommodate because it is their apartment. Go ahead and ask, if they refuse then it\u2019s better that everyone meet in public, or for you to host.", "Ywbta because you\u2019re asking the roommate to change his behavior in his own apartment while you are there. I would suggest instead that you only make plans with Carly when her roommate isn\u2019t there and ask Carly not to smoke or do things out where you aren\u2019t in an enclosed space with smoke. You\u2019re not the asshole for not wanting to be around the smoke, but you can\u2019t dictate the roommates choices in his home", "NAH. It's not rude to ask, just make sure you tell her  why (it gives you a headache/makes you nauseous) and that it comes w/no judgement, and if she or her roommates say no, respect that. It's their place so it's up to them, but they probably have no idea how bad it hits you. Just be honest and not demanding, hopefully they'll be chill either way.", "NTA. Tell them that the smoke from the weed makes you sick and if possible could they wait til you\u2019re gone to smoke. If she objects just say you understand it\u2019s her home and she is welcome to visit you at your home but she needs to leave the drugs at home. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of for not wanting to be around drugs and alcohol. I refuse to be around smokers of any kind. I can\u2019t even be around candles before I start coughing and gasping for breath.", "If they're that oblivious that you're uncomfortable with them smoking, you'd do best just not going over there again.  Just decline any future invitation and let them know that their second hand smoke makes you physically ill. At that point, they can have the opportunity to volunteer to stop smoking or just accept that you can't be around it.  \n\nNTA  I'm thinking Carly and her friends knew what they were doing, especially with labeling you the token straight-edge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And this is coming from someone who has been on both sides (either indulging in front of others or not doing it around people who were) in the past.\n\nIt's their apartment, so they can deny your request.

They can say no & that's fine, it'd be an AH move for her to push it, but what's wrong with just asking?", "Geez why are you so harsh she's not judging just asking if she can do her a favor.

It's just common sense to not tell people what they can do in their own home. You can ask, but they don't have to comply. Chances are good that just the smell of the apartment will make her sick.

I didn't say she couldn't ask, but if she does, it's not cool. \"My house, my rules\" does apply here.", "That's why she isn't she's asking if she can make a little change to accommodate her like excluding meat dishes when serving a vegan.", "Bad analogy. It would be more like removing all the meat from your house for a vegan guest."]}
