I know what I'll say may sound hash but I hate kids, seeing kids remember of the time at the foster care so I really can't enjoy spending time with them and can't pretend I do. \n\nMy brother had a baby with a girl after school. They weren't really together and she didn't wanted the baby but brother did so she kept it and gave it to my brother. Now my brother was very different to me. He loved kids and specially kids in need, he loved to help and I know he was always a better person. We grow apart when we grow up because of how different we were, but were still in contact though text mostly. \n \nMy brother and I were born with a congenital heart disease (Eisenmenger syndrome) which if you're not familiar with the disease it basically means that without the right care, our hearts/ lungs will just stop working (to put it on easy terms). My brother had a heart attack when he was just a few hours old, that's how we found out we were sick basically. Obviously no one wanted to adopt us because we were like little bombs, we have known our whole life that we were probably gonna die young as we couldn't get the surgeries we were meant to. My brother always took care of himself, but sadly he died of a heart attack fifteen days ago. \n\nHis daughter is staying with a friend of my brother, but she had asked me to fill for custody of the child and this is where I might be the asshole. I told her I will not so that, I can't take care of her and I dont want to. She said that I'm the only family she has now and I can't let her alone. I think that she should contact her mother, she's this child's family not me, I don't deserve to be put in this situation. It's best if she goes to her mother. This woman is insisting that I take her with me because its what my brother wanted. How can I take care of her if I can't even look at her and pretend not to hate her? I despise children, there's nothing I can do and I feel like I'm being put in a situation where I either do what they expect from me or I'm the bad guy.
