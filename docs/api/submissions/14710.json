I know what I'll say may sound hash but I hate kids, seeing kids remember of the time at the foster care so I really can't enjoy spending time with them and can't pretend I do. \n\nMy brother had a baby with a girl after school. They weren't really together and she didn't wanted the baby but brother did so she kept it and gave it to my brother. Now my brother was very different to me. He loved kids and specially kids in need, he loved to help and I know he was always a better person. We grow apart when we grow up because of how different we were, but were still in contact though text mostly. \n \nMy brother and I were born with a congenital heart disease (Eisenmenger syndrome) which if you're not familiar with the disease it basically means that without the right care, our hearts/ lungs will just stop working (to put it on easy terms). My brother had a heart attack when he was just a few hours old, that's how we found out we were sick basically. Obviously no one wanted to adopt us because we were like little bombs, we have known our whole life that we were probably gonna die young as we couldn't get the surgeries we were meant to. My brother always took care of himself, but sadly he died of a heart attack fifteen days ago. \n\nHis daughter is staying with a friend of my brother, but she had asked me to fill for custody of the child and this is where I might be the asshole. I told her I will not so that, I can't take care of her and I dont want to. She said that I'm the only family she has now and I can't let her alone. I think that she should contact her mother, she's this child's family not me, I don't deserve to be put in this situation. It's best if she goes to her mother. This woman is insisting that I take her with me because its what my brother wanted. How can I take care of her if I can't even look at her and pretend not to hate her? I despise children, there's nothing I can do and I feel like I'm being put in a situation where I either do what they expect from me or I'm the bad guy. This woman also told me the child's mother may not want to take her in and she'll end up in foster care which I know is horrible.

No?\n\nWhy?\n\nIf I am not obligated to do something for a stranger, I am not obligated to do it for a relative.", "Well I doubt she\u2019s as likely to sexually abuse or traffic her. Keep in mind Tates was pulled out of Romania.", "In Romania? That might be true in the US, but is much less likely to be true in Romania. I don\u2019t think someone who despises children is a good caregiver for a vulnerable recently orphaned child, but I also think it\u2019s idealistic to act like this child isn\u2019t facing a very rough life in a very broken system.", "Nobody agrees? Oh no! I could not possibly give less of a shit.  \n\nRight and wrong don't depend on what's popular.  Leaving your neice to the wolves falls squarely in the \"wrong\" category. So what sorts of things could one use to justify this wrong? You've submitted \"trauma\". I've rejected it. She's 28, and her neice is a child. She knows exactly what's waiting for her neice if she rejects her (your favorite excuse for asshole behavior, trauma), and she's gonna leave her to it anyway. This is horse shit, and she has no business feeling OK about doing this to that poor girl. \n\nWe're not gonna see eye to eye on this. I understand if you don't want to invite me to uour birthday party.\n\nEdit: remember how both her and her brother cam be assholes at the same time? Come on, we just talked about this.", "You understand it? Children are people. \n\nHating on any other group of people puts you in massive ahole/facist territory. Hate women? Hate foreigners? Hate other races? Hate anyone with a disability? = you're an Ahole.\n\nBut you think hating children is fine? Nah, it's not. There's something deeply wrong here.", "Probably the kid too, but hey.", "I'm bringing snacks as a last meal", "Yes and that connection could drop dead any time due to the same issue that killed her father. Why put her through that again?", "Heck I have kids and will protect your right to ascend this hill with my life.", "All aboard Hill Mountain!", "\"The bodies on the hill\" what lies beneath?  Coming to you soon on Hulu", "That's so dumb. Everyone dies eventually. No matter who takes responsibility for the child will die as well. I can't believe that's a real opinion", "That is true about her mother.  I guess I was hoping that she had matured since the daughters birth,  as she sounds like she was young, not that that's an excuse,  I was a very young mother and didn't walk away from my children\n\nI am currently raising one of  my grandsons, who is 2, and have been since he was 4 months old. However, due to his medical and behavioral issues,  a result of a brain injury,  we could not take his little brother,  who was also removed from his parents at 4 months old a year later. It would not be safe for the little one. We tried for a while, but it didn't work out. He is with an amazing foster family, and we get weekly visits.\n\nEveryone's circumstances and abilities are different. I really do not believe it makes anyone a bad person to know their limitations and be self-aware enough to realize that they are not the best option."]}
