I know what I'll say may sound hash but I hate kids, seeing kids remember of the time at the foster care so I really can't enjoy spending time with them and can't pretend I do. \n\nMy brother had a baby with a girl after school. They weren't really together and she didn't wanted the baby but brother did so she kept it and gave it to my brother. Now my brother was very different to me. He loved kids and specially kids in need, he loved to help and I know he was always a better person. We grow apart when we grow up because of how different we were, but were still in contact though text mostly. \n \nMy brother and I were born with a congenital heart disease (Eisenmenger syndrome) which if you're not familiar with the disease it basically means that without the right care, our hearts/ lungs will just stop working (to put it on easy terms). My brother had a heart attack when he was just a few hours old, that's how we found out we were sick basically. Obviously no one wanted to adopt us because we were like little bombs, we have known our whole life that we were probably gonna die young as we couldn't get the surgeries we were meant to. My brother always took care of himself, but sadly he died of a heart attack fifteen days ago. \n\nHis daughter is staying with a friend of my brother, but she had asked me to fill for custody of the child and this is where I might be the asshole. I told her I will not so that, I can't take care of her and I dont want to. She said that I'm the only family she has now and I can't let her alone. I think that she should contact her mother, she's this child's family not me, I don't deserve to be put in this situation. It's best if she goes to her mother. This woman is insisting that I take her with me because its what my brother wanted. How can I take care of her if I can't even look at her and pretend not to hate her? I despise children, there's nothing I can do and I feel like I'm being put in a situation where I either do what they expect from me or I'm the bad guy. This woman also told me the child's mother may not want to take her in and she'll end up in foster care which I know is horrible. I don't know what to do here. \n\nIn case it is necessary to know, we live in Romania.", "created_utc": 1681408942, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kxnxb/aita_for_not_taking_over_custody_for_my_brothers/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know your limits and walking away from this is okay.\n\n\"I know he was always the better person.\" -- OP you wrote this as if comparing his interest in kids to your non-interest.

For 1- you\u2019ve been honest about how you feel, and quite honestly that wouldn\u2019t make for the best situation for you or your niece.\n\nFor 2- you also have the same rare condition as your brother and don\u2019t know how much longer you will have (granted none of us do, but it\u2019s slightly different in your situation).   If you took her in she could quite possibly be faced with losing then two loved ones and caregivers In possibly a short period.   \n\nIt\u2019s a very difficult situation,  but contacting the mother first would be best and then if she refused unfortunately your niece would have to enter the system.   \n\nAlso, I am curious if the niece has been tested to make sure she doesn\u2019t have the disease as well. \n\nIn any case I am very sorry for both of your loss", "NTA - its not your responsibility to take care of someone else kid, being family does not require you to do that.   \n\n\nalso some people just don't like kids and thats okay, its not that big a deal and i never understand why others get so butt hurt just because not everyone wants a kid", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then she has to go through this all over again. It is better to find someone one now than make this poor girl lose someone else just as unexpectedly.", "I really feel for you here. She won\u2019t be a child forever and you may end up like sisters. But at the same time you will suddenly need to become a parent which is not what you want. Either way this child must be in hell right now with no parents and having to go and live with people she doesn\u2019t know, whether that\u2019s you or her mother it\u2019s not going to be easy for her. I have to say NTA because you are in a a really difficult position and also given your own health perhaps she would be better with her mother.", "This isn\u2019t an asshole/not the asshole type question. Your choice will greatly impact both yours and your nieces life. \n\nMost parents hate their kids but love them even more, it\u2019s not easy to look after them and there will be ups and downs but it is all usually worth it in the end. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t rush to a decision as you are probably still grieving but if I were you i would have a serious think about it and also talk to your niece about it too. \n\n\nYou would need to give up a lot but it would also save her from a shit system you know all too much about, it\u2019s only 6 years for you so you will be 34 when she is an adult, but to her it\u2019s 1/3 of her life. \n\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. There should be a social worker that handles this and the first point of contact should be the girl's mother not you. \n\nTaking her in when you don't want her will show. It will be bad for both of you. Feeling unloved and not wanted can become a big trauma. Just because you're family doesn't mean that's the best thing for her. \n\nI love kids, but I can also accept and acknowledge that some people are not suited for kids or they just don't like or want kids period. It shouldn't be so hard to understand that people are different. \n\nAnd it seems like you have a very strong dislike for kids,  maybe a result from something in your childhood, I don't know. But that's more than enough of a valid reason on its own. You shouldn't have to feel guilty for feeling the way you feel.", "Nta oof. This situation sucks on several levels.  But someone who hates kids should 100% not be a guardian of a child.", "No one is the asshole here. This is a really sad situation. I think you should consider taking the kid in as she\u2019s 9 and not super young like baby age, so she will be more like a mini roommate. If she does go to care try and visit her and stuff bc that\u2019s jus so sad. But if u really feel like you can\u2019t take her don\u2019t. \ud83e\udd7a", "NAH for sure. It is your choice for a lot of reasons and as others have said think about it, weigh the options, and make your choice.

Maybe you think of her as more of a tiny roommate that needs a friend? You both loved your brother, so that\u2019s a good binder", "NTA. But you really should take her in if the mother won't since you know how foster care is in your country, even with your concerns around your life expectancy.", "How old is the kid?\n\nI think there should be a social worker on this case trying to find out where the mother is. She might be in a completely different place in life now than she was when she had the baby. She might even want to get to know her child. That's the number one solution.\n\nI would think you would feel bad for the kid knowing what it is like living in foster care. Kinda makes me think YTA for not stepping up. BUT I also think you are not suited to be a caretaker and you need therapy. You don't need to want kids of your own or even like kids. But I think you have deeper issues that makes you feel this strongly about children in general. And you need to work on those. \n\nAnyhow. Your brother is the real AH for not having a plan for this moment, knowing the state of his health.", "People who don't want children shouldn't have children so NTA.

This kid if half your brother, and has done nothing to you... and you want to send them into the foster system. Did you really have that much fun there yourself, that this is the fate you want for your only neice? When you're too old to take cate of yourself and need assistance, I hope you ask this kid. And I hope she asks me for advice on what to tell you.", "NAH. But\u2026 please realize you hated children when you were in foster care because you were in a shitty situation interacting with other kids in shitty situations.  Taking in your niece would involve building a relationship with one specific young person who your brother loved.  I don\u2019t think you can compare her to the kids you encountered when you were her age.  Also, there are plenty of people who don\u2019t like children in general but love their own because of the bond and the relationship that is built.  Please take this into consideration before making a decision.", "YTA\n\nAs bad as foster care is in Romania, the child is better off without you\u2026", "Nah you won\u2019t ever have to see or hear from her again. Plus you know how bad the foster system is so she will really suffer being all alone so since you hate kids that should make you happy at least", "Your allowed to say no but to be honest it's an AH move imo.  that baby is all that's left of a brother you loved. Try to get the mother to take the child, and if she won't you should step up.\n\n I would imagine that 20 years from now I would hate myself for not stepping up and taking care of the only remaining part of my cherished family member.\n\nBut this is my opinion, you are free to choose whatever you think is best, but I doubt you'll feel good about yourself when it's said and done.\n\nSorry for your loss regardless.", "I'm sorry to hear of your brother's death, my condolences.\n\nThe NTA bit. Your brother would have wanted what is best for his daughter. You're certain that you'd be a terrible father. So on that front, she wouldn't be cherished if you adopted her. It doesn't sound as though your brother planned for this, which is peculiar knowing as you do that life can be precious but very brief.\n\nThe YTA bit. What's the alternative? You haven't outlined the alternative future for your niece very much. Truthfully, I don't know enough about the Romanian adoption system to have an firm opinion, but it feels like it's bad enough for you to baulk at putting her into it. If it is a magnet for abusers, then even if your going to pretty much ignore her as she grows up at least that would be in a safer environment?\n\nYou need to find the child's mother and have an honest conversation with her. Did you brother leave any papers with this 'friend'? He might have had something planned for this eventuality.", "sad situation all around.  i'm sorry you hate children, because they are the most precious things in the world.  i'm sorry you can't find a way to have compassion for her and give her love and take her in.   my judgement is based on what i think everyone should do and that is to do the right thing no matter how much you think you're getting a raw deal.
