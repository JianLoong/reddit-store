No thanks.", "NTA. Expecting free accommodations is an ah move on his part though", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t let someone stay in my house when I am not there either.  I find that very strange.", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult who has the responsibility to find his own accommodations. If you're not comfortable sharing your home with the children, you shouldn't be forced into it. \n\nIt's not wrong if him to ask, but it is wrong for him to be upset and hold it against you. \n\nI don't like living with kids myself,  but due to situations,  I am now living like that.  And it is chaos.", "NTA.. If you don't want people on your house when you are not there then that is fine.. they don't pay your rent", "NTA - Asking to be a guest when you are there is not unreasonable, but essentially demanding a free AirBNB with three unknown kids is pretty entitled and unreasonable.  If they can't afford the trip, they shouldn't make it under the presumption that someone is just going to give them a house.", "NTA you made very understandable reasons and then you have to think of your kids and family to how would they feel having three people they met once sleep in they bed look in they stuff play with their stuff", "NTA. What was the plan if you weren't going away, stay with you anyway? Get your parents to help with accommodations? \n\nI'd really like to know how long ago he asked. A month? A week? Yesterday?", "NTA, I don't like the sound of people I don't really know in my house while I'm not there either. Your reasons to be worried are completely valid.", "NTA - You are not making him spend a ton of money on a hotel or Air BnB since you are not forcing him to visit your parents for the holidays.", "NTA. If money is right then he shouldn\u2019t drive 6 hours away when his new family won\u2019t fit at his parents house and he didn\u2019t have money for a hotel.", "NTA. Your reasons aren't unusual. Your bro is the AH.", "NTA.  We're talking about your primary residence, not an Air BnB.  I get that your brother is trying to save a few bucks, but it's unreasonable to expect someone to hand their primary residence off to a handful of strangers for a few days.", "NTA he's a grown man, shouldn't he have thought about accomodations months ago?", "NTA your house, your rules.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nThey will destroy your house and get mad at you if you get mad at them for doing it.", "NTA he can invite your parents to his place.", "NTA. It\u2019s your home. You are allowed to say \u201cno\u201d for any reason you want (or give no reason at all). Also, your brother is not entitled to use your home just because he is family (and he is too cheap to get a place for himself). \n\nHonestly, I would have a problem with people I don\u2019t know being in my house as well, even if a relative were with them.", "NTA Just no. It is one think to have people as guest but to not be there?! Who knows what they do? If they snoop through your stuff, use everything, steal or break your belongings? Before you go you would secure important things snd stuff that nobody should find, then the cleaning. Afterwards you must check what they did and again the cleaning.\n\nAnd who wants people sleep in their bed? Maybe read their personal documents? You will find months later reminder that they were there and this not in a positive way.\n\nAll this just because they want to save some bucks? Why haven't they booked an airbnb or hotel a long time ago? Christmas is in a few days! They planned to stay with you the whole time. Too bad. I hope you have a camera and your parents don't have an emergency key...", "NTA: Would you be willing to let/trust your parents to stay in your house and have your brother and family stay at their one-bedroom? Just be sure to have cameras at your place to make sure they follow through. My guess is your parents refuse.", "I mean it's your house, but you know your brother is struggling.  Is he normally trustworthy?  Are their things that would be hard for you to replace?  Sometimes we take risk with family, while I wouldn't say you are an AH I think you could be a better brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His own choices are making him spend money. With that entitled little temper tantrum, it's obviously in your best interests to not have him in your home unsupervised. He already thinks he's entitled to free access to your home, what else will he think he's entitled to when you're not around?", "NTA", "NTA, this is a big ask.", "NTA. It is your house and personal space.\n\n>I know he's recently gotten furloughed and money is tight but still, I dont like the idea.\n\nWith that said, if you have a good relationship with him; perhaps assist him in getting a hotel/airbnb if your own finances can afford it. Otherwise it might be cheaper for Mom and Dad to simply visit him.", "He is asking too much of you. NTA.", "NTA , if it were just your brother or you were more familiar with his family I might think differently but probably not. It\u2019s not in any way unreasonable to not want anybody let alone strangers in your house without you present", "NTA\n\nSince when is family entitled to other houses if the host isn\u2019t even home. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t let my brother stay in my house with his \u201efamily\u201c - but strangers to me, if I wasn\u2019t home.", "NTA- That's such a strange request.", "NTA..if ya'll were staying at home for the holiday where would he have stayed?

I wouldn't want people i don't know in my home either.", "NTA.\n\nMy MIL's family was always \"we're all family, so just walk in and make yourself at home\", and I never could understand it. Thankfully husband didn't pick it up from her.\n\nIt's okay to have a different standard and it's okay to say no. If he really wanted this favor, I don't understand why he wouldn't have spoken to you earlier so you would have a chance to at least facetime the family etc and see if that might help.", "NTA then I guess he can\u2019t afford to come for Xmas I wouldn\u2019t let them stay either", "NTA", "NTA", "You're NTA, but check your vibe with how you treat your brother and his wife. You specifically call his three step children \"her kids\" and I can tell you with an attitude like that you're going to drive a wedge between you and your brother. They are now THEIR kids. Something to think about moving forward.", "INFO: what is your parent's input? Didn't they have some kind of plan for hosting them? Could they stay in your house with your brother and help keep an eye on things?", "I still don't like the idea of anyone in my house while I'm gone. But my house wouldn't be great for my parents either. No bedrooms on the first floor and my parents have joint issues and don't do well with stairs. It just wouldn't work out even if I was comfortable with that.", "We get along fine. But I haven't lived in the same city as him in my adult life so I really don't know him that well anymore. I don't doubt his intentions, but 4 strangers in our place where my family lives while gone is just very unnerving to me. I was that age, we broke stuff, kids in my class stole, you name it. I just don't know them well enough to have any trust or not built up.", "He refers to them as her kids. Their dad is still around and there's no plans to adopt or anything like that. My brother and I are both adopted so its not a blood/bio thing.", "My parents haven't had any input in these discussions. But they certainly aren't able to keep an eye on 3 kids at all times.", "And if you made that arrangement, there\u2019s no question that your brother and his family would stay at your house anyway.", "I get it.  I guess for me, this is causing a rift. Is the worry of your stuff worth not having much of a relationship with your brother going forward.", "Thanks for clarifying! I was kind of shocked you said \"her\" given the nature of your post - but if that's the norm and he also refers to them as hers, I can't see it offending anyone. I just didn't want you to say something to your brother and set him off since he's already mad.", "Just weird that your brother would be showing up with a whole ass new family in tow and not have discussed arrangements with your parents! NTA - but I think you should consider giving it a chance to let them stay."]}
