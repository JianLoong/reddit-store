How about parents stay at your house and brothers family in the condo? If they want free accommodations? Hmmm?", "NTA for setting a boundary and sticking to it, but as an outsider not knowing the history or relationship with your brother, it is a reasonable request from a sibling to make given the circumstances you\u2019ve mentioned. By refusing, you\u2019re implying  that you don\u2019t trust him to make sure that your property is respected (not broken/stolen/messy) while his family is staying there, and that could really damage your relationship. Valueable items can be put away, or even replaced, but people cannot be. Times are tough for some people now, and he may not have been expecting to have to budget for accommodations. That\u2019s on him of course, but could be the reason he is so defensive.", "NTA.   But for the sake of him being family and to keep peace, maybe you could install deadbolt locks on all the bedroom doors so all your valuables could be put away and remain safe.   Then you could tell him he could stay there but the bedrooms are off limits and he will have to bring an air.mattress.  you could also give strict rules about what was allowed during their stay and have him sign it and agree to pay for any damages.  Another alternative would be to say he & his wife could stay there and the kids could stay w grandparents \n\nMaybe all of that would.be enough to get him to back off from wanting to stay,and if he  agrees to those terms, being uncomfortable would discourage them from overstaying their welcome and possible discourage any future requests to stay with you.  And that way he nor your parents can say you wouldnt allow him to stay.", "NTA. If anything, the fact that you only met his stepkids AT HIS WEDDING says a lot about his approach to merging these two families. He doesn\u2019t give the stepkids a chance to get to know their new family, but expects the new family to let the stepkids stay in their home? AH move right there", "NTA why aren't your parents traveling to see him. It's a lot easier for 2 to travel and stay with the family of 5 than the other way around.", "NTA. If you keep any spare keys around your property, remove those.

He isn't coming to visit you, there is no reason for him to stay in your home.\n\nIt also makes a lot of extra work for you. I would have to clean my home top to bottom if someone stayed there for a week. Changing sheets on beds, and cleaning bathrooms is a lot of work. I wouldn't trust anyone who said they would do it either. It would be nice for you to do but I would not be comfortable with someone living in my home while I wasn't there.", "NTA  it's a giant ask to bring someone's else's 3 kids! to stay in your home while you aren't there!", "Nta. Absolutely not. If this entitled now, imagine how bad it\u2019ll be when they have full access. Stuff will definitely be dirty, broken, missing and you\u2019ll never be made whole or always wondering where that one thing went", "NTA. You don\u2019t know them (minus your brother obvi). My friend and I went on a trip to the city my fianc\u00e9s Mom lives in. She spends summers in our state so she wasn\u2019t going to be at her place - while it would\u2019ve been nice to stay for cheap, I didn\u2019t think it was my place to ask as I was just her sons girlfriend of a year and a half (at the time). She ended up offering us her place and use of her car under the condition we didn\u2019t get her in trouble with the condo board lol. We paid her (even though she didn\u2019t ask us too), made sure her car was full, cleaned the place top to bottom including laundry and ensured everything was how she left it. Were 30 & 27 though and there were no kids. I have a child (and now baby), and unless I knew someone\u2019s parenting style and overall personality it\u2019s be a hard pass for me", "YTA it\u2019s not a \u201csomeone\u201d it\u2019s your brother. If you don\u2019t trust him to take care of your house, that\u2019s just bad family dynamics. I could never turn my brother and his wife/kids away\u2014 especially if I knew he was struggling & just wanted some time with my parents. \n\nWhat\u2019s a family for, if not to make life easier on hard days? Everyone seems to think the brother is being entitled\u2026. Guys he didn\u2019t show up with bags and his family, he asked. \n\nIdk I feel like people these days can\u2019t even be there for their own family\u2026 it\u2019s very sad. \n\nWhy not just make it contingent on them leaving the place clean and paying for damages?", "I would ask him if he would feel comfortable with your whole family. Going to stay at his house while he and his family isn\u2019t home for the same amount of days that he wanted to stay at your house. See how comfortable he would feel then. His poor planning is not on you to fix.", "NTA & it\u2019s pretty entitled to assume you\u2019d just hand over your house to them. It\u2019s their responsibility to have enough money to cover their own expenses plus I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re expecting to stay for free? Tell him it\u2019s your home, not a free hotel.", "NTA - it's your home and he shouldn't guilt you into doing something that makes you uncomfortable! If money is tight, why can't your parents come to his city and stay at their place for Christmas? Seems 2 adults travelling and staying in, what I presume is a house large enough to accommodate them, would be easier than trying to corral 3 kids on a 6 hour drive and figuring out accommodations for a family of 5.", "Oooh this. Loop in a trusted neighbor and call authorities immediately with any unauthorized access", "NTA. You could discuss your issues with him and ask for a $500 deposit, but I will also bet they might trash the house if you did that. With his three standard, ordinary, not-wicked kids, you quite possibly would come home and find toys missing. It happens, and it would guarantee bad feelings forevermore. Just not a good idea, and I'm so sorry.", "NTA whatsoever. Your brother is being entitled and unreasonable. I know very few people who would want someone staying at their place while they are gone. Especially when you barely know most of them apart from your brother. Not to mention, if you feel this way now just imagine how you\u2019ll be feeling once you are away and they were there. You\u2019d probably be constantly worried and thinking about it which in turn would ruin your own trip for you.", "I think it's harsh, but am not calling you the AH because it's your house and you're entitled to decide who stays there. \n\nDoes your brother have a history of breaking your stuff and not taking responsibility for it? Don't you trust him? Could you pack away anything you're worried might break and/or would be expensive or hard to replace?", "Also if he is furloughed then traveling for Christmas is not really a necessity...", "We seem to be in the overwhelming minority here, but I agree.", "He DID get to the week before Christmas without making reservations, which does not impress me with his common sense.", "Right? Like if my own brother was going through a hard time, I would do what I could to help. \n\nThis guy won\u2019t even be in town and refuses.", "Nta, i don't know anyone who'd want people in their home while they're gone themselves. Especially a bunch of literal strangers. You'd have no idea if they're gonna respect your home, or you'd come back to pile of ashes. I wouldn't take the risk to find out either.", "NTA. What entitlement. I have maybe 5-10 people in the whole world who I would let stay at my home alone while I was gone. I've known most of them at least 20 years (others my entire life) and none of them are children.", "NTA. Tell him to rent a room and be responsible for his own family", "I would typically agree with this take. Except, it's not his brother he doesn't want there and I feel it would be different if it was just the brother. \n\nHe's met the new wife's kids once at his brother's actual wedding, they only live 6 hours away..... They are clearly not close or it was a very rushed wedding, or I think the brother has massively failed here by not putting more effort into bringing his brother and his brother's family together with his new family before marriage and before asking to stay at their home?", "So OP should acquiescence to every single demand her brother ever makes, in case not doing so causes \"a rift\"? Have you ever heard the missing stair analogy?", "NTA\n\n100% they will wreck something", "NTA...of course not. People cannot expect you lend out your home, they just cannot. Even if you had known the kids and didn't want it, that would be OK too. Your home, your choice. Your brother though.....wooo....I would not forget how he tries to guilt you in letting them stay. I would be very disappointed in the brother.", "NTA.\n\n\nYour house is not a air bnb. And if he can't afford the visit the  he should not be traveling anyway.", "NTA\n\nNo one stays at my place unless I am there. Thats a perfectly reasonable boundary to have. You also dont know the new wife or her kids, and I guarantee those kids are going to be getting into your kids stuff. Shit will get moved, broken or taken.\n\nIf he is unhappy with the cost of hotels or Airbnbs then he should have either started planning and saving earlier or offered to host your parents at their house.\n\nThis fucked up idea that just because you are siblings you have to share everything just pisses me off. Your both adults and it really sounds like he needs to grow the hell up. \n\nHey adult sibling, lend me your house and all your and your families stuff so I can be a cheapskate oh and I'm bringing 4 people you basically dont know into your personal space while your not there and if you dare say no Imma throw a tenper tanty", "Ok hear me out, I\u2019m going to say ESH based off of my culture. I\u2019m Filipino and we\u2019re generally known to be accommodating people and offer what we have even if we don\u2019t have much. But I get it. Brother sucks for feeling entitled to stay at their house and OP sucks for being, I don\u2019t know\u2026 annoyed? at his brother for asking. I\u2019m not saying he should say yes but he should understand why they are asking.", "Tell yourself whatever you like to feel ok about it.  I hope you and your kids don\u2019t ever have to ask him for a favour.", "Rein, not reign.", "If the brother is struggling then he shouldn't be traveling.", "NTA. He should feel just fine. I\u2019m sure if OP ever needs any help he\u2019s adult enough to figure it out without getting pissy coz someone don\u2019t do what they ask.  Why the hell is the brother even traveling if he has no job and can\u2019t afford a hotel.", "Exactly. It would make more sense for the parents (2 people) to travel to the son versus a family of 5 traveling with one parent is without a job.", "Of course they shouldn't and I never said that.  But I guess they should decide if this is the hill they want their relationship to die on.  And I'd say the same thing to the brother."]}
