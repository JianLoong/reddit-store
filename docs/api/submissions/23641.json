One of the conditions of me moving back in was that we wouldn't talk politics at all. My mom and I can have really good and fun discussions on other topics and I genuinely enjoy talking with her, but there are certain topics that just put me in a bad mood.\n\nNaturally, my mom can't follow this rule. We don't see eye to eye on pretty much any political issue, but she can believe whatever she wants. I just don't want to talk about it. I find political discussions completely draining and exhausting, and there's nothing productive to be gained from it when my mom argues that America's biggest problem is that \"it's getting more brown\"\n\nYesterday while having lunch with her I mentioned how I almost got caught out in the rain while going cycling, and my mom couldn't resist but use that comment to make a snide remark about climate change not existing. That lead to an argument, eventually a shouting match, in which I told her that I absolutely cannot wait to move out again and that living here has been a mistake for me and my mental health.\n\nA day has passed since then, and I've been thinking about what was said, And I don't know if that was too harsh or something. My mom isn't one to show emotion (in fact I never know how she feels), so I really don't know how she took that comment. On the other hand, it's true - it has been constantly stressful living here, and feels like walking on eggshells when any topic can veer toward a political discussion.\n\nFor the record, I am planning to move back out, but it will take about another 1-2 months right now.\n\nTl;dr: during a heated argument with my mom, I told her very clearly that I cant wait to move back out and that I hate living here with them.", "created_utc": 1690899170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fds6y/aitah_for_telling_my_28m_mom_64f_that_moving_back/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it cannot be honored it's just as reasonable to part ways, so NTA.", "Your request to avoid any political topics is reasonable, and your mother has consistently violated that reasonable request and boundary. She's ignored those boundaries by needlessly making snipe remarks that devolve into political shouting matches. I don't know what she expected to happen other than push you away.\n\nNTA", "OK. So it seems that your mom is basically credulous and ignorant, and channels Fox News talking points without any attempt at critical thought. You're willing to avoid discussing certain topics in order to keep the peace, but she just can't manage to avoid regurgitating Hannity or whoever.\n\nNTA", "NTA. For someone to say climate change isn't real is galling. The other comment is of course, racist. Dealing with people who are on the extreme right side of politics IS exhausting as most of what they believe is nonsensical.\n\nYou just told her the truth, that you can't wait to move out and moving back in was a mistake. Shrugs shoulders.", "NTA. It's not your fault that she can't keep an agreement or that she doesn't understand the difference between the climate and the weather.", "NTA you've set your boundaries and she's ignored them", "NTA. \n\nYou both agreed, no political talk. If she can't keep up to that rule, it's all on her. Good luck with you moving out again.", "NTA. Your mother made an agreement with you and she is failing to keep her end. I doubt she has malicious intentions, but there is a reason why you insisted on this rule before moving in. While she might argue that it wasn't her intent to bring up a political topic, she can't claim that as a reason for not dropping it immediately once she becomes aware that she had stumbled onto a political issue.\n\nIf you really feel bad, there's nothing stopping you from apologizing for *how* the sentiment came out, without apologizing for the underlying truth of your statement. That also would give you an opportunity to calmly restate your intention to move out (and what that timeline is if she doesn't already know), and request that she make a greater effort in the time you are still there.\n\nAlso, as someone who has been through variations of this with each parent, I have some advice on what worked for me: \n\nThe first time they bring up an off-limits topic, remind them that it is off-limits, and offer them the opportunity to change the topic. If they don't change immediately (including if they attempt to argue whether what they said *actually* qualifies as the off-limits topic), end the conversation by saying goodbye and leaving the room/hanging up the phone. Repeat as necessary.", "NTA but why are you getting into arguments about climate change. It takes two to tango.", "INFO:  Is moving out a feasible reality?  I wouldn't live in a situation with constant arguments, if I didn't have to--especially as an adult.", "Nta. You were honest after she broke your agreement.  Next time she does this walk away.  Do not engage. Mom is an idiot you will never change an idiot. Get out now!", "I try not to talk about politics, religion and racism with certain people. If you both know you strongly disagree on the matter there's no need to talk about it and cause a argument so I completely agree with asking that to keep the peace. You guys had a agreement she isn't keeping her end of it so I don't think saying how you want to leave is bad. Always speak up for your mental health. NTA sorry your mom has wonky beliefs. Incredibly happy you didn't let racism become a part of you just because you were exposed to it.", "Like for me I'm black but my daughter is half white. Family will sometimes make comments that seem like being half white is something we need ignore because of racism in the country. They say things that basically I feel will make her hate half of who she is like some completely deny her white half and see her as just black. Like they can feel how they want but I will not tolerate it spoken in my presence nor will I tolerate her father's sides prejudice stuff about black people around us. I have to be more vocal about it because it affects my daughter. All this to say I completely understand where you're coming from.  It really sucks.", "You moved back at their request.  This is important.  There was an agreement in place which you mom chose to ignore.  (My guess is that she isn\u2019t even aware when she has shifted to political topics; it sounds like her politics have become an important part of her identity.)\n\nThat said, things said in the heat of argument can be phrased in a hurtful manner.  You could have spoken about your fear with any conversation going political.  You could have spoken about the eggshells.  You could have said that you needed to move out because of the eggshells.  \n\nBut your comment was more frustration with a desire to be more injurious than productive.  I suspect a calm conversation about, I can\u2019t live here any longer because\u2026.would have have potentially been more impactful.  \n\nSo, ESH (although you only the tiniest amount).", "Been in environments like that before, where the host is just overflowing with this compulsion to disgorge political awfulness, but they're the only one allowed to do it. It's absolutely lose lose. If you don't engage, you just have to passively take vile abuse and they always walk away thinking they've wowed you with their sage gibberish. If you do engage, only thing you accomplish is souring the relationship.\n\nIt's the sort of thing you might put up with for a few hours from relatives you almost never see, but it's like nails on chalkboard every second and anyone would go mad living that way. Often leads to borderline abusive dynamic where you feel like a punching bag who has to just sit there and take it.\n\nYou have to draw a hard line. Only way we've ever made any progress here is by enforcing any truce terms (everyone stopped coming to family reunions because it was so bad and nobody wanted that). If you have no leverage to enforce with and your parent has no willingness to abide, not much you can do other than get out. Definitely NTA, take care of yourself for sure.", ">  I don't know what she expected to happen other than push you away.\n\nI can answer that, she expects me to \"think for myself\" and to stop being \"brainwashed\" by the media", "Love this comment! Agree completely.", "Yeah but in this case OP set the rule \"don't talk about politics\" and their mother is breaking it by making statements intended to get a reaction and start an argument. Even if OP doesn't argue back this isn't solving the issue.", "I'd rather not get into details as of why, but it is a reality in about two months, if everything goes well \ud83e\udd1e", "And by thinking for yourself, she means, \"This is my viewpoint, and I expect you to have the same!\" IE, brainwashing you.", "This is funny in a way because The Media\u2122 does not cover climate change as the emergency that it is.", "You're NTA. There was an agreement and she has chosen not to abide by it. That said, this isn't about \"discussing politics\". Climate change denial isn't \"politics\", it's somewhere between political misinformation and straight-up delusion. She's expecting you to indulge her delusions. You're just asking her not to talk about them.\n\n(I do think less of you for indulging a racist though. As the saying goes, if there's a Nazi at the table and 10 other people sitting there talking to him, you got a table with 11 Nazis.)", "I\u2019m telling you this from experience, she wanted you to move back so she could have someone to fight with. Some people don\u2019t feel good about themselves unless they\u2019re trying to make someone else look inferior.", "NTA. Mom's pushing your buttons, looking for an argument. Politics is simply her choice of button. Have you had that 'walking on eggshells' feeling since you were young? I doubt this behavior just came up recently.", "You can be NTA, and you can still decide to apologize for yelling and maybe for some of what you said, if you do have regrets. It might have hurt her feelings. Sometimes it's hard for parents to admit that. \nI've had almost the same situation many times with my Dad. Living together definitely makes it harder. All the best. My Dad eventually stopped watching Angry Cable News and things got much better.", "NTA for standing up for yourself and deciding to move out   \n\n\nFor the sake of your mental health, is there a way you can disengage from political talk in the remaining time you're living at home? Could you simply get up and walk out of the room when your mom brings something up?", "> My guess is that she isn\u2019t even aware when she has shifted to political topics; it sounds like her politics have become an important part of her identity.)\n\nYou're absolutely right. During our argument, she straight up said the 3 things she cares about most are (and I quote) the climate change bullshit, the gender bullshit being pushed on children, and globalization and white replacement.", "I hate to admit it, but I mostly agreed with them politically when I was younger. As an only child, I didn't have much else to go by. \n\nThis waking on eggshells feeling only started when I moved out and went to college, and largely 180'd most of my political stances", "She doesn't want you to think for yourself, she wants to think for you.", "Funny how scientific research that prove a fact different than her ideas count as brainwashing and not the enormous amount of podcasters that spout rants without any evidence. I'll bet you she doesn't fact check her sources either", "Seeing as how you can't move out again right away leads me to believe that you weren't really asked to come back, but you needed to and they offered to take you in. If that's the case, you don't get to tell her how to speak in her house (although her views do sound awful). You're 28, this wouldn't be a problem if you were independent. ESH", "NTA. My mother is just like this and tried this a couple of times after I moved home to help her care for my dying father. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this helps, but whenever she tried to bait me, I would calmly state \u201cWe agreed not to discuss this.\u201d  I had to say this about six times the first time she tried - I just kept restating \u201cWe agreed not to discuss this and you are not upholding your end of the agreement.\u201d without addressing any other part of her nonsense. She eventually stopped.", "Your mom is goddamned right that America's biggest problem is getting more brown. Between heatwaves, fires and hydrologic problems. And what are the politicians doing? Nothing!\n\nWhat, she does not mean brown like that? She's TA.", "NTA.... good luck", "And you'd be completely wrong. I won't go into too much detail, but I was planning to sell my condo and my mom invited me to move back in to make the selling process easier. 1-2 months is how long until the sale closes and I can find a new place to live.", "You could try arguing back with nonsense.  When she says America's problem is \"it's getting too brown\" ask if she means because the ozone layer is depleted causing more people to tan, or if it's the rise of sunless tanning?  Then you can talk to her about the benefits of each and move the topic to skin care.  \n\nSounds like you'll never get her to see your perspective or anything logical, so why use logic?  Fight crazy with crazy.  And if you get stuck, bring up conspiracy theories.  Like Britney Spears dying years ago (pre-kevin federline) and being replaced by a clone to continue her music career.  Or who really killed Marilyn Monroe (was it the Kennedys?  The mafia?).", "Mom here! My kids all lived with me off and on in their 20s and my son had to move back in with us recently until he decides what his next step is. He\u2019s told me before he can\u2019t wait to move out which I completely understand. He loves having his own place and I never take it personally. She should be able to respect your wishes. I do not discuss politics because it is so draining so I totally get that. Sometimes we lose our temper but if you want you could apologize for yelling but still make it clear that your boundaries stand!!! Good luck\u2026 Reddit Mom", "NTA, it sounds like the truth though. Good luck getting out of there!", "NTA. As an adult human, you made a request. She, as an adult human, chose not to comply. So you move out. Simple math.", "\ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd15", "NTA\n\nThe next time she says \"it's getting more brown\", respond with....  \"Huh, the native Americans would disagree with that.  There's clearly too many white people!\"\n\nWhat I sometimes do with people that are politically opposite is just agree with them, in a very flat tone.  You know, \"Sure, that must be right!  I've heard it so many times, how can it not be?!\"  Or \"Absolutely, there's no data/science/statistics/whatever that backs up those claims!\"  All while rolling my eyes.\n\nAnd sometimes, if I don't care if I ever see them again, \"Let's just stop.  You think I'm misinformed and I know you're stupid.  Let's just leave it at that.\"\n\nEdit: fixing typos.", "NTA\n\nPlease also be aware that at your mother's age, you need to watch out for signs of dementia.  We're dealing with this now with my MIL and the filter has come off of her mouth.  Any conversational discretion she had is just gone, and it's difficult not to take it personally.", "NTA.  I'd be counting the days when I would never have to talk to someone like that again.", "NTA. But I wonder if mom is doing it on purpose and baiting OP into a argument. Some people just want to argue about things.\n\nI'd tell OP to not take the bait if so. I learnt that you can just ignore comments sometimes and it widens out better than escalating or fighting back. In most cases it's not like you are going to change their mind. \n\nThere are polite ways to talk and discuss about politics that OP and mom seem incapable of doing. So perhaps OPs boundary is the best method.", "right, cause I'm sure none of her political stances are influenced by whatever media she consumes", "Omg, I laughed out loud at this! I love this take. Fight crazy with crazy. Amazing."]}
