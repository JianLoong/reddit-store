She's the first of my friends to be pregnant, so I'll be 100% honest and say that I don't know the netiquettes surrounding it. \n\nI was talking to my mom and the topic of presents came up (where we live, it's more common to give gifts after the baby is born). I know that it's more usual to give gifts for the baby, but my friend had told me that she has several bags full of clothes and old toys at home from her SILs, I decided to get something for my friend. \n\nFor once, I basically got her a care package with all of her fav snacks and instant foods (her fav Ramen, Pizza, Lasagna). Her husband - who is the cook in the relationship - gets paternal leave in August and while he still offered to cook and meal prep for her, we all know that life happens and sometimes there is no time, or you have a bigger appetite/get hungry earlier. So I just thought it would be nice for her to have some low effort food at home, just in case.\n\nSecondly, I got her a coat. Yes, it's May, but she was talking about this coat all winter and never bought it because she didnt wanna spend money on her own with the baby on the way. I really wanted to get her something for herself, because she talked a lot about how she's scared to be only viewed as mother and not her own person. For example, she hates how her in-laws will greet her tummy before they greet her or how they refer to her as \"Mama\" instead of her name. \n\nMy mom told me that it's a stupid gift, as again it's more custom to get something for the baby (or relating to the baby). When I told her that they have a lot of clothes, nappies and clothes (as she suggested to just get a 'care package' with this), she said that you can't really have too much of this. My mom also said that this present might come across as me not respecting my friend's decision to be a mother, which is absolutely not how I want it to come across as. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is this a stupid present?", "created_utc": 1685190041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t6015/aita_for_my_baby_shower_gift/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a mom, that\u2019s a great gift. It\u2019s well thought out and meaningful. A care package is an awesome idea. \n\nWhat you could do if you like is throw in a baby book or a piece of clothing so there is something for baby too\u2026 so you cover all your bases if you think others will give you a hard time. Mom & dad are going to need easy to grab foods and she may not bring herself to spend money on a nice coat again because they have the baby so you did great.", "NTA\nYou know your friend best. If you think she will appreciate the gift, than go for it! \nI've done something similar loads of times, but I usually also throw in something small for the baby.\nMaybe like a gift certificate for clothes. Those are usually good for a long time and she can use it when the baby is a little older or to boy something for a special occasion.", "NTA-A lot of people focus solely on the baby which is fine but it\u2019s nice to see someone remember that mom\u2019s there too and show mom some love.", "NTA -- Your gift sounds absolutely lovely. I'm sure your friend will love the care package and coat.", "Nta. It's really sweet.\n\nAsk your friend if there is anything she wants for herself and the baby. \n\nGive her the baby gift at the shower and maybe take her out for coffee/lunch and give her her gift.", "NTA - for comparison, all we want as expectant parents are doordash gift cards. We would love it if we got a care package like that!\n\nAlso in the past, I have gifted parents Starbucks giftcard (in addition to diapers or something), and they all said it was a lovely bonus gift that I thought about them.", "I don\u2019t think so at all! She\u2019ll get a ton of stuff for the baby from everyone else so she\u2019ll appreciate you thinking of her specifically", "NTA.  Very thoughtful gifts.", "NTA\n\nShe said shes getting a ton of clothes and toys, so if you got one, itd just get lost in the pile. As others said, you know your friend better than strangers on the internet. I think you did good.", "NTA.  Stick some nice chocolate in there too.", "NTA.  Not a stupid gift for your friend. who is in need of some TLC.  You should get a gift specifically for the baby as well, which would let your friend know you care about both her and her baby.", "NTA. your gift is for your friend who you know best and acknowledges what she herself will want. i would add something small for the baby, maybe a blanket, socks, maybe a book or stuffed animal for the future! what you're doing is fantastic and i'm sure your friend will love it :)", "Your gifts are very kind and thoughtful. You listened to what she needed and wanted and responded accordingly. That\u2019s being a great friend. Your mother is being weird. NTA", "I f'ing love your gift and the thought you put towards your friend. NTA.", "NTA - Your gift is fine. And especially the food is showing that you respect her as a mom because your thought was to get her things that are easy to deal with. Any mom would appreciate that.\n\nEdit: If you really want to get something for the baby, diapers are always appreciated too.", "NTA you know your friend. If you think she'd appreciate the gesture toward her needs rather than more nappies and onesies, go for it.  It's not traditional but that doesn't make it wrong.", "NTA you\u2019re giving her her oxygen mask, and I love it!  \n\n\nMaybe include a sweet note about how important it is to take care of herself, so she can be the best mother for her little one.", "I\u2019m not sure, I would say NTA because you have good intentions. If you want a care package for your friend, look up things that might help her aftercare. Witch hazel, icy pads, ring pillow, etc. will be needed for at least a week after vag birth. If she is having a planned c-section, you might want to research things for her comfort.", "Nta sounds like a good gift", "NTA Ignore your mom. It\u2019s not for her. I bet your friend will love this.", "Nta but you could throw in a pacifier or something", "It's an incredibly thoughtful gift. Clearly your friend has shared with you that she's feeling like just a vessel for a child recently, and the coat is a great way to remind her she's important and deserves nice things too. But I do agree with the posts of others saying you should get something for the baby as well. Just a cute babygrow with a picture or slogan you'd both find funny maybe??? It may cone across that you aren't interested in her child if you don't acknowledge it some way.", "As a mom to a 3 year old and 9 month old, I would have loved this as a gift!!!

This gift shows that you are a good friend!", "NTA\n\nMy mother has a plant that someone gave her at her baby shower for me. She still loves and appreciates the plant because it\u2019s the only gift someone got for her, not for me. She felt very seen with that plant.\n\nMy mother loves plants, and your friend has expressed explicit interest in the coat and the same feelings my mother had back then. I think it\u2019s very thoughtful.", "NTA. That's lovely. My SIL always used to get gifts for her being a mum. I would get her things and stick a note on them saying, \"NOT TO BE USED BY ANYONE BUT SIL,\"", "NTA--I make it a point to make a \"mommy\" basket when I visit new parents/baby.  A lot of times, everyone gets stuff for the baby (clothes, toys, etc...) but the parents--especially if a first time mother--are also in need.  My basket usually consist of things a bit more post-partum related (nipple balm (if breastfeeding), pads, perineal stuff (spray/bottle, wipes, pads, etc...), snacks, fuzzy non-slip socks, etc)...I sometimes include a bottle of wine if I know they'll appreciate it *and* their taste.  I will usually bring along one or two small items for the baby but it's usually one of those \"my first books\" or something and a toy that lights up and plays music that is meant to help calm/distract the child.", "Absolutely NTA, you\u2019re a very thoughtful friend. (Also sorry, have to point out the word is \u2018etiquette\u2019 no \u2018n\u2019 needed).", "Nta. This is the best present! I had a baby a year ago, and I wouldve loved it if my friend did this for me. It's true, everyone forgets about the mother.", "NTA I made my SIL a care gift plus gift for the babies.\nI got her pjamas, snacks, vouchers, and baby recovery items. It's a nice gesture and also highlights that she is being thought about, too.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d say you\u2019re considering their needs in a personal and loving way. Good for you!\n\nFwiw a friend of mine gave his brother and SIL a bottle of decent whisky because he reckoned they\u2019d need it.", "NTA, although my one worry about the coat is that her body is going through a lot of changes and getting the right fit might be hard. It could be a huge letdown if she finally gets the coat she wants but can\u2019t wear it.\n\nI\u2019d also suggest giving her the coat (or any other personal gift that isn\u2019t related to the baby) privately, just because baby showers usually involve a public opening of gifts and you\u2019re giving something that isn\u2019t a typical shower gift and will draw a lot of attention due to that. Give her the care package at the shower and the coat another time. And think about adding a copy of one of your favorite books from when you were little - books are always welcome.", "Your gift is very sweet. Unfortunately, a lot of people \"forget\" that a mom is still a person after having a child. I have a lot of friends who are moms and even on their birthdays, people will give them baby gifts. You're giving her a gift based on her as a person, not her status as a mom to be.", "NTA because you\u2019re a caring friend BUT your mum is right. In the context of a baby shower, that would not be a good present. You should get her a typical baby present and add on the care package or coat for her personally. The baby shower is to focus on the BABY. You\u2019re really sweet to focus on your friend too outside of motherhood, but that should be in addition or outside of the baby shower present", "I wouldn't say YTA. You have good intentions but I would still include something for the baby. Maybe ask her, the husband or someone else close if they still have something missing? If not get something little or something individualized/special for example maybe a little blanket or a nappy or a snuggly with the babies name stiched to it. Or what we got ones a friend  cause she is more of a practical person and doesn't want things, was a CPR class on babies. She thought it was super cool.", "Sorry, YTA. Listen to your mama. I guess this is why baby registries exist for baby showers. So that people don't buy stupid gifts for a baby gift.", "Add a book that your friend can read to her bub. Baby related but still all a out your friend.", "She didn't have a registry", "That was kind of a joke? Meaning, if you had a registry, the last thing your friend would have put on it... was a coat \ud83d\ude2c", "You speak as if you know that the friend doesn't want the coat.", "Does it matter? Would you buy roller skates for someone who doesn't have legs?", "No but if my friend was talking about the roller skates she wanted all year but didn\u2019t buy, yea. I\u2019d get her roller skates.", "Do peoples arms fall off while giving birth? She will want a coat in the colder months", "Wow... did you hear the \"woosh\" going over your head?", "Bad... just bad.", "How? You never had a friend buy you a gift you wanted before?", "Yes? But I'm not even sure how that's relevant, or how the argument dissolved into such a ridiculous point \ud83e\udd23", "She bought a gift her friend wanted, that isn\u2019t arsehole behaviour"]}
