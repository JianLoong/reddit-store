She's the first of my friends to be pregnant, so I'll be 100% honest and say that I don't know the netiquettes surrounding it. \n\nI was talking to my mom and the topic of presents came up (where we live, it's more common to give gifts after the baby is born). I know that it's more usual to give gifts for the baby, but my friend had told me that she has several bags full of clothes and old toys at home from her SILs, I decided to get something for my friend. \n\nFor once, I basically got her a care package with all of her fav snacks and instant foods (her fav Ramen, Pizza, Lasagna). Her husband - who is the cook in the relationship - gets paternal leave in August and while he still offered to cook and meal prep for her, we all know that life happens and sometimes there is no time, or you have a bigger appetite/get hungry earlier. So I just thought it would be nice for her to have some low effort food at home, just in case.\n\nSecondly, I got her a coat. Yes, it's May, but she was talking about this coat all winter and never bought it because she didnt wanna spend money on her own with the baby on the way. I really wanted to get her something for herself, because she talked a lot about how she's scared to be only viewed as mother and not her own person. For example, she hates how her in-laws will greet her tummy before they greet her or how they refer to her as \"Mama\" instead of her name. \n\nMy mom told me that it's a stupid gift, as again it's more custom to get something for the baby (or relating to the baby). When I told her that they have a lot of clothes, nappies and clothes (as she suggested to just get a 'care package' with this), she said that you can't really have too much of this. My mom also said that this present might come across as me not respecting my friend's decision to be a mother, which is absolutely not how I want it to come across as. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?

In the context of a baby shower, that would not be a good present. You should get her a typical baby present and add on the care package or coat for her personally.

If not get something little or something individualized/special for example maybe a little blanket or a nappy or a snuggly with the babies name stiched to it. Or what we got ones a friend  cause she is more of a practical person and doesn't want things, was a CPR class on babies. She thought it was super cool.", "Sorry, YTA. Listen to your mama.

OP, I'm like you, and I really appreciate the way you think - yes, the person is having a baby, but they are still a person and it's great to be spoiled for who they are. It also shows you listen to her and the things that irked her (tummy greeting!!). I had a friend who had cancer and a double masectomy, she then fell pregnant and was kinda sad she wasn't able to breast feed... But this girl loved her wine - so for her shower I got her a really delicious bottle of red wine, because let's celebrate the wins here, ya know?? And it gave her a laugh and she really enjoyed the present that was just for her!

Like, if they are on Reddit they could still see it and say holy shit that\u2019s me that\u2019s my story. \u2026.I\u2019ve always wondered this", "NTA as a pregnant lady this sounds fantastic and kinda made me cry at how thoughtful it is. It shows you see her for her and care for her", "NTA I know a lot of moms who would love this present. Your mom is just old school but she doesn\u2019t realize that the new generation isn\u2019t caught up in what the \u201crules\u201d are and it\u2019s the thought that counts", "NTA.\n\nBest baby shower gift I got was a Door Dash gift card to bring me food after my girls were born.", "NAH \n\nI think you're a great friend.", "NTA. I love that you got HER a gift. A woman doesnt stop being herslef when she has a baby but people tend to stop seeing that. I applaud you.", "NTA. If the baby complains, then you have a problem.", "NTA. Many mothers have postpartum issues, and something just for them helps. I did something similar for my friends, and they all really appreciated it.", "NTA, that's a wonderful gift. For example, when I got an extra baby thermometer, I asked the person giving the gift to exchange it for a gaming mouse. I'm a person with my own interests, not just a womb with tits.", "NTA at all. I am childfree and feel sad watching my friends and relatives lose their identities to just being a mom. They are people that are also mothers. I ONLY give gifts that I know they will not get themselves because someone has conditioned them to think it's selfish to think of themselves with a child otw. I also make sure to consider ways to keep their sperm donors or rogue relatives from co-opting the gift as much as possible - female relatives are the worst bullies. There\u2019s no reason that mom shouldn\u2019t get something she loves that will make life easier or her feel better about herself. You can\u2019t make happy well-adjusted babies with unhappy parents.\n\nExamples: multi surface or grippy phone/tablet stands that you can mount on anything, recliner with ottoman with my friend\u2019s name embroidered on the headrest (the husband tried to keep it as his gaming chair and I moved it out of his stupid man cave where he avoided child care myself), cleaning vouchers, gift cards to ladies apparel stores, designer bags large enough to pass of as diaper bags if needed, a fancy knife set for my chef friend, mattresses, a very expensive collectible from a childhood favorite that doubled as a mobile in the nursery, care package of international snacks from a place we traveled together but mostly things he had food insensitivities to, self-care products, spa vouchers, massage vouchers that were only in her name, supportive footwear, high quality size specific sport nursing bras that she said were too hard to justify at that price that could be used as regular sports bras after lactation, etc. \n\nOnly once did I get a baby specific item and that was because I listened to my friend\u2019s husband tell her that the little rinky dink stroller from baby 1 was fine for the next kid (ignoring that toddlers don\u2019t all of a sudden walk calmly with mom) so she got the Cadillac of multi baby strollers custom ordered in a color he absolutely despised.", "NTA\u2026you did good.  Do not listen to your mom.  I am sure your gift was much appreciated.", "NTA: I always bring gifts for the mother, and they\u2019re always the most appreciated gifts at the shower. Being pregnant can often be thankless and isolating, so knowing you\u2019re thinking of your friend is sure to brighten her day too.", "NTA it's thoughtfully chosen.\n\nAnyone can buy yet another package of newborn-sized onesies that won't get worn because no baby needs 89 of them.", "One of the teams I supported sent me one of those fancy snack basket things after I had my daughter and more than a decade later it still makes me smile. Even with both of us home full time those first couple weeks we could barely think let alone cook nutritious meals, and tasty food we could just stuff in our face kept the blood sugar up.\n\nThe coat is so thoughtful too, especially if you're sure it's not too small for her post-partum. Maybe include a little note about how you're so happy for her, about to be a mom, but you wanted her to remember that she is loved for just herself too. \n\nYou don't have to include anything for the baby, but if you have a chance to browse the picture books section, you might find something that speaks to your friends' style and interests. I really liked this cute board book we had \"Urban Babies Wear Black\" that reminded me of my goth-aesthetic and city loving self at a time where everything was feeling suburban and bland.", "NTA i would disregard everything your mom said. \n\nIt\u2019s traditional to get things for a baby but when I had a baby shower, I would have been THRILLED to get a gift just for me. \n\nI hope this becomes a trend", "NTA. As a women who is also due in less than 3 weeks.... I love your gift. So thoughtful. You're a good friend.", "Just make sure it's big enough. I didn't fit anything after.", "The title threw me a little because the coat sounded a bit odd if this were to be at a baby shower event itself. NTA, and it sounds like you put a lot of effort and thought in, OP.", " You are respecting your friend\u2019s concerns. And, the best gift brought to me after the emergency birth of my son was a basket full of snacks", "Those are usually good for a long time and she can use it when the baby is a little older or to boy something for a special occasion.", " Especially after the clothes are all outgrown.", "The other books to get are: the Shit no one tells you AND Toddlers are assholes, it's not your fault. Now I can tell you I would LOVE that care package when I was pregnant. It was very thoughtful and I'm sure the friend will appreciate someone getting HER a gift and not just for the baby.\nNTA If you want to add a gift, onesies in Newborn size. People often skip and get 0-3 months but those tend to be HUGE on a newborn. And newborn diapers", "My wife has been begging for \"Goodnight Goon\" for when our little critter pops out, I'm ordering it and a couple of cryptid baby books a coworker recommended next check to surprise her.", "You might want to check out \u201c C Is for Cthulhu\u201d & others by the same authors", "I'll check it out, it should fit in with the hazy dell set I was looking at, thanks for the suggestion!", "NTA, your mom is forgetting what it was like to be a new mom. Most of the time the mom is forgotten, even with medical care everything revolves around the baby. \n\nThat was incredibly thoughtful to give something specifically for your friend. I would have killed to have someone think of me and send food or show up to help. My husband worked long night shifts in a physically demanding job at the time and we had a toddler. My recovery sucked, especially trying to take care of a newborn and 3yr old. \n\nYou're a great friend, keep that kind of thoughtfulness going because I bet you'll be the only one that thinks of her.", "With the addition of next size up diapers, your gift sounds awesome. Just double check with the cook on freezer space so they\u2019re ready.\n\nETA: NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou know your friend and the care package sounds great.\nThe coat could maybe wait for her birthday?\n\nThe point of this gift-giving is the beginning of a new life in a family, so I would suggest giving something that helps everyone (the care package does, but the coat does not).\n \nIf it matters: I am also from a country that does gifts after birth of the baby.", "NTA. Your friend needs that more than you\u2019ll ever know. Trust me.", "Perfect gift and very thoughtful! \n\nNTA", "NTA very practical and thoughtful gift", "NTA. Your gift sounds incredibly thoughtful and sweet.", "That was a well thought out gift. Take a smaller present for the baby but definitely bring this and show your friend you listen to her and care about her feelings. Nta you kind kind person", "Nta i dont have children yet but almost all my coworkers do. Whenever we would have a baby shower for them i would get a gift for the baby like diapers and wipes or bath stuff and clothes but i always put in a gift card for mom as well with a note stating that i wanted them to be able to buy something for themselves since i know everyone is focusing on the baby.\n\nThey all loved it, i feel like of course the baby is important but people need to remember and celebrate the mother as well so i always make sure to do that. \n\nSo no theres nothing wrong with your gift and your friends going to love it.", "NTA, Like most commenters I think it is a great idea. But the coat: yea, great idea, but .... fashion ..... Will she still like it next winter? Maybe a card good for a one-day shopping spree for a winter coat like that one. Or a picture of the coat to be used towards .... And a 'shopping spree' can also be Internet these days. \n\nGreat idea, just seeing some potential little pitfalls ....", "NTA this is a really thoughtful gift I would of loved to have some pre-made meals gifted to me.", "NTA that is an amazing gift and a great idea.  I have never thought of doing that for friends having babies.", "NTA\n\nThere are such thoughtful and heartfelt gifts.", "NTA. That's a really nice and well-thought gift. When my first nephew was about to be born, his mom had TONS of clothing and caring items and the only thing they needed was a carseat and a changing table. We were asked to not get gifts (again, tons of stuff) so my mom and I went to this really fancy chocolaterie and got her special chocolate (hand made, no nuts, she has allergies). The look on her face was worth more than what we spent on it. It was something she could enjoy after the pain and sleepless nights she was about to have.", "NTA-I got a care package as a gift at my baby shower, and I absolutely LOVED it! I got pajamas, a nice robe, some snacks and self care items\u2026I used the pajamas and the robe at the hospital, which was so much better than the itchy garments I was offered. I think what you\u2019ve done is thoughtful and kind, and your friend will appreciate your gift. You could even arrange it into a cute gift basket and label it \u201cPostpartum Care Package\u201d or something along those lines. \n\nHowever, if you\u2019re worried your gift will cause some drama, you could always put in a gift card to the place she is registered at, or maybe some books she can read to her newborn. But again, I really do think your friend will love what you\u2019ve done :)", " NTA Everyone will give her things for the baby. You\u2019re reminding her that under all of that she\u2019s still a person.", "I guarantee you they\u2019ll appreciate and use your gifts more than half the stuff the asked for and thought they wanted. Nobody should ever say such things about such a thoughtful gift. NTA", "You are a wonderful friend! Your mom is way overthinking. NTA", " NTA I would have loved something like this for myself!", "NTA\n\nPersonally I like to get something for baby (it helps if they have a registry of what they need)\n\n*and* something special for Mom! It's so thoughtful you're doing that for your friend because so often the Mom gets forgotten because of all the baby madness\n\nI'm sure if you add a pack of diapers you will be fine", "Oh love I would have really really liked someone gifting me something like that. Of course she'll need all that stuff for the baby and yes at times you can have too much of something. I bet she will love the gift. Thought you would say a sex toy or something lol. That is very very thoughtful of you.", "NYA. After watching the younger generation having kids, it seems your gifts are great ideas. She will get plenty of baby things. I give gift cards, so they can get the right size clothes, diapers and formula/food as needed, when needed.   I still have to get the annoying toy that the kids always love and parents hate.", "Hi, \n\nI\u2019m about to be a new mom. Our baby shower is tomorrow. Today, our friends hosted a party focused on us, and got us gifts. When I tell you I\u2019ve been balling for the last 4 hours. \n\nThey got us gifts for each of us individually, a lot of our favorite snacks, some gift cards to order in and for date night, and some items for us as a couple. My best friend said \u201ctomorrow, there\u2019s going to be a ton of gifts for baby girl. Today, this is to remind you that you guys are also people outside of just being parents\u201d. \n\nSo, what I see is that you see and heard your friend. As a mom, that\u2019s important. You are a great friend. \n\nNTA.", "I could be wrong, but there's a really good chance it'll be her favorite present. Definitely NTA", "NTA! You are SUCH a caring and thoughtful friend! \ud83d\udc96", "There is nothing stupid about this, you are a kind and thoughtful friend. Definitely NTA", "That sounds so thoughtful! Agree with other posters you can toss a baby outfit in and call it good. Getting mom a gift is always such an after thought but it is a really nice thing to do if someone can afford an extra gift. It also sounds so sweet to me that you got her the coat she wanted and her favorite foods. Personally if you were my friend I'd adore it all. Nta. I think your mum is just thinking of the more traditional style of baby shower gift and there is nothing wrong with that either.", "You are a lovely, thoughtful friend. The baby shower is for gifts for the mum too. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I think it\u2019s great that you got something for the mom. Everyone else is going to buy something for the kid who won\u2019t even care. We don\u2019t generally have baby showers where I live but when I visit loved ones in the maternity ward I always bring a gift for the bay and for the mom. What you did/you\u2019re doing is very thoughtful.", "NTA. I\u2019m an event planner. Ive seen hundreds of baby showers. This is a GREAT gift.", "Add something small and sweet for the baby too. Explain your considerate thinking in a card to her", "NTA I think your friend would be happy getting something that isn\u2019t for the baby", "As a pregnant person I would love this NTA", "So you got a gift that is something you know 100% that your friend will like and that she wouldn't buy for herself. \n\nIsn't that exactly what a gift should be? \n\nNTA", "Your friend has already expressed worry about being seen only in relation to the baby. You have provided a gift that sees her as a whole. I think she will likely cry and be very appreciative. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Any new mom would love something aimed at her! Easy foods, especially ones she likes are a wonderful idea!", "NTA this is wonderful \ud83d\udc9d", "NTA\nThat\u2019s a wonderful gift", "That is a wonderful present!  I completely disagree with your mothers opinion.  Your gift is very sweet and thoughtful.  I know from experience that a woman that has just given birth feels utterly exhausted and her hormones will start going crazy afterward.  Giving her something to make her feel good for after the baby is born will mean a lot to her.  She will know how special your gift is.  I would have loved having the care package and coat.  Nice job!", "NTA I have given care packages before to moms and they have always loved it.", "NTA. I love that you see she is still your friend. You see that she is struggling with things like ppl touching her and seeing her as just a mom already, and will struggle with food. The food is practical and thoughtful and the coat is so sweet and thoughtful.\n\nYou obviously love your friend deeply, and you likely know her better than your mum does.", "Agreed. I always gift a momma gift alongside baby items when my friends have their babies. \n\nThere's so much excitement surrounding the new addition, and sometimes the mom gets lost in the hustle and bustle. \n\nMy absolute FAVORITE gift when I was pregnant with my daughter was from my bestie. She gifted me a basket of baby items, but also a cute printed out voucher for 5 different 1-hour sets of babysitting. She gave me a gift card for a massage as well.\n\nMy kiddo was in the NICU after she was born, and it was such a stressful time. Once we all got settled in at home, my friend would show up and watch the baby so I could shower or nap. After a few months of recovery, she insisted I use the massage certificate while she watched the baby. It felt so nice to do something for ME that wasn't mom related. I keep that in mind when gifting to pregnant friends. \n\nIt sounds like OP is keeping her friend in mind while gifting, and I'm sure it will mean a lot!", "Gift certificates that can be redeemed for time holding the baby so they can take a nap or a shower.", "I agree. This seems like a really thoughtful package that will remind the friend that she still gets to be an individual while taking on a new role as mom. \n\nOP, if you decide to add in something for Baby, sensitive skin wipes and diapers are always appreciated. Also I'm sure your friend will be happy with some visits from you when she's ready after the birth.", "A cute set of matching mommy/baby shirts or something would be a nice thing to add.", "I love that book used to read it to my nephew it was the only thing that got him to sleep some nights.", "Yes! I got that book and bath bombs for my friend when she was pregnant and she loved it.", "A woman doesn't stop being herself when she has a baby, but people stop seeing it.", "Check out Hazy Dell Press. We have several of their books and my kids love them. \"Don't Eat Me, Chupacabra!\" is a favorite.", "My kid and I loved Goodnight Goon and The Runaway Mummy!\n\nAlso highly recommend Julia Donaldson books.\n\nAnd as they get a little older The Book with No Pictures is hilarious.", "That's the set I'm looking at actually, that 5 box set with \"Monster ABC's\" and \"Get Dressed Bigfoot\" just looked like it'd be up her alley (and hopefully his too).", "You\u2019re 100 years old with 4 nieces and nephews and think you know everything right?"]}
