She's the first of my friends to be pregnant, so I'll be 100% honest and say that I don't know the netiquettes surrounding it. \n\nI was talking to my mom and the topic of presents came up (where we live, it's more common to give gifts after the baby is born). I know that it's more usual to give gifts for the baby, but my friend had told me that she has several bags full of clothes and old toys at home from her SILs, I decided to get something for my friend. \n\nFor once, I basically got her a care package with all of her fav snacks and instant foods (her fav Ramen, Pizza, Lasagna). Her husband - who is the cook in the relationship - gets paternal leave in August and while he still offered to cook and meal prep for her, we all know that life happens and sometimes there is no time, or you have a bigger appetite/get hungry earlier. So I just thought it would be nice for her to have some low effort food at home, just in case.\n\nSecondly, I got her a coat. Yes, it's May, but she was talking about this coat all winter and never bought it because she didnt wanna spend money on her own with the baby on the way. I really wanted to get her something for herself, because she talked a lot about how she's scared to be only viewed as mother and not her own person. For example, she hates how her in-laws will greet her tummy before they greet her or how they refer to her as \"Mama\" instead of her name. \n\nMy mom told me that it's a stupid gift, as again it's more custom to get something for the baby (or relating to the baby). When I told her that they have a lot of clothes, nappies and clothes (as she suggested to just get a 'care package' with this), she said that you can't really have too much of this. My mom also said that this present might come across as me not respecting my friend's decision to be a mother, which is absolutely not how I want it to come across as. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?

She felt very seen with that plant.\n\nMy mother loves plants, and your friend has expressed explicit interest in the coat and the same feelings my mother had back then. I think it\u2019s very thoughtful.", "NTA. That's lovely. My SIL always used to get gifts for her being a mum. I would get her things and stick a note on them saying, \"NOT TO BE USED BY ANYONE BUT SIL,\"", "NTA--I make it a point to make a \"mommy\" basket when I visit new parents/baby.  A lot of times, everyone gets stuff for the baby (clothes, toys, etc...) but the parents--especially if a first time mother--are also in need.  My basket usually consist of things a bit more post-partum related (nipple balm (if breastfeeding), pads, perineal stuff (spray/bottle, wipes, pads, etc...), snacks, fuzzy non-slip socks, etc)...I sometimes include a bottle of wine if I know they'll appreciate it *and* their taste.

It could be a huge letdown if she finally gets the coat she wants but can\u2019t wear it.\n\nI\u2019d also suggest giving her the coat (or any other personal gift that isn\u2019t related to the baby) privately, just because baby showers usually involve a public opening of gifts and you\u2019re giving something that isn\u2019t a typical shower gift and will draw a lot of attention due to that. Give her the care package at the shower and the coat another time. And think about adding a copy of one of your favorite books from when you were little - books are always welcome.", "Your gift is very sweet. Unfortunately, a lot of people \"forget\" that a mom is still a person after having a child. I have a lot of friends who are moms and even on their birthdays, people will give them baby gifts. You're giving her a gift based on her as a person, not her status as a mom to be.", "NTA because you\u2019re a caring friend BUT your mum is right. In the context of a baby shower, that would not be a good present. You should get her a typical baby present and add on the care package or coat for her personally. The baby shower is to focus on the BABY. You\u2019re really sweet to focus on your friend too outside of motherhood, but that should be in addition or outside of the baby shower present", "I wouldn't say YTA. You have good intentions but I would still include something for the baby. Maybe ask her, the husband or someone else close if they still have something missing? If not get something little or something individualized/special for example maybe a little blanket or a nappy or a snuggly with the babies name stiched to it. Or what we got ones a friend  cause she is more of a practical person and doesn't want things, was a CPR class on babies. She thought it was super cool.", "Sorry, YTA. Listen to your mama. I guess this is why baby registries exist for baby showers. So that people don't buy stupid gifts for a baby gift.", "Add a book that your friend can read to her bub.

Those are great gifts. I have no idea what your mom is talking about with your gifts \"not respecting her decision to become mother\" that's so weird and no one is going to think that.", "Nta. That sounds great. I have 2 kids and that care package sounds like it would have been great.", "NTA. As a recently new mother I really appreciated that my friends and family did not ignore me as a person and treat me as \u201cjust a mom\u201d after I got pregnant and had the baby. This is a very thoughtful gift and your friend should appreciate it. \n\nIf you want to do something for the baby too you could also include a baby toy or a cute onesie (maybe themed to something mom likes? My friend gifted me a birdwatching onesie and I loved it! Here\u2019s a tip with gifting baby outfits: don\u2019t gift newborn clothes, give them something 1 to 2 sizes up.

You mom should keep her opinions to herself.", "NTA, this kind of gift would have been refreshing and very appreciated after I became a mom! Now that I\u2019ve been through it myself, whenever my friends have a baby I make sure to give them multiple items that are for them. Literally everyone else will drown them in baby stuff because it\u2019s the \u201cfun\u201d stuff. You are a great friend for using all you know about your friend to gift her so thoughtfully. Good job!\n\nEdit to add: If you want to make sure she knows you aren\u2019t excluding the baby from your gift maliciously, just include a note explaining your thought process!", "NTA.

When I was pregnant, people gave me baby things for my own birthday and Christmas. I would have loved a gift just for myself.", "NTA. I bought my friend a mum care package when she first told us she was pregnant. I got her a token baby grow but the main present was for her.

I'm sure your friend will love the care package and coat.NAT", "It has to be a boomer thing; when my best friend gave birth we went together to visit and she brought some onesies and thought I was insane for bringing my friend snacks and candy.", "I recommend a book called \u201cgo the f*** to sleep\u201d", "Nta. That sounds great. I have 2 kids and that care package sounds like it would have been great.", "I do not care what is going on or what I'm growing inside me.. A gift of my favorite foods is ALWAYS the answer.  I don't care if I'm on a diet, the occasion is a funeral and/or my husband is a stay-at-home chef.. I always want a huge bag of Swedish Fish and spanakopita.", "It may cone across that you aren't interested in her child if you don't acknowledge it some way.", "NTA. This is the BEST present. OP, I'm like you, and I really appreciate the way you think - yes, the person is having a baby, but they are still a person and it's great to be spoiled for who they are. It also shows you listen to her and the things that irked her (tummy greeting!!). I had a friend who had cancer and a double masectomy, she then fell pregnant and was kinda sad she wasn't able to breast feed... But this girl loved her wine - so for her shower I got her a really delicious bottle of red wine, because let's celebrate the wins here, ya know?? And it gave her a laugh and she really enjoyed the present that was just for her!
