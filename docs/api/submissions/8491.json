Jenna is married and has a two year old, she is a SAHM because she is disabled. She lives on the west coast in a small apartment with her family. Megan lives with me and attends university, she is currently in her first year of obtaining a master's. \n\nRecently, Jenna's husband lost his job and they cannot afford rent on Jenna's disability. Jenna asked my parents if they could move home, I overheard the conversation while visiting my mom and offered for Jenna to move in with me since my parents home is small and in a small town with few job options. Jenna happily agreed and said they would move in at the end of this month since their landlord is allowing them to break the lease since they've been good tenants for 7 years. \n\nNow the way my house is set up is important. I have a three floor home, the upstairs is completely renovated into a mil suite. It has a small kitchen, a bedroom, a smaller bedroom, a small living room and a bathroom with a tub. My first floor is irrelevant. However my basement has a bar, family room, a bedroom and then a huge room with a small bedroom and small bathroom with a standing shower in it. The basement is completely finished. The huge room is probably 1k sq feet. We were going to turn this room into a home gym so it has nice flooring with thick padding underneath. The small room bedroom attached can fit a full size bed but not a queen.\n\nWith that said Megan and her dog live in the upstairs room. She does not use the kitchen for anything, I cook all her meals for her since she busy with school. So when I told her Jenna was moving in I said she was going to get moved to the basement room since Jenna would use the kitchen and the division of the two rooms would allow her and her husband some level of normalcy.\n\n Megan flipped out and said that what I was expecting is wrong since she has lived there longer and she is tired of everyone catering to Jenna all the time. She doesn't want to be in a nasty basement with bugs and not have carpet. She didn't feel like moving anything and wanted to take baths (we still have a bath on the first floor she could use). I told her my husband would move the large objects and I'll help her pack everything.\n\nHerr strong emotional reaction is making me feel like i would be an asshole if I made her move. My husband is very much on it's our house and it's our decision. Jenna has no clue what room she is getting so she probably won't be disappointed either way but I feel like logically the basement makes more sense for Megan, especially because she can take the dog for a walk easier this way. I however only have a few days to get this figured out. \n\nI'm not sure though WIBTA for making her switch rooms?\n\nEdit: for clarification Megan does not pay rent, utilities or food costs. Jenna would also not be expected to pay for rent, utilities or food.", "created_utc": 1674854103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mwa12/wibta_for_making_my_sister_move_to_the_basement/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the laundry is in the basement, Jenna might find having laundry on the same floor easier, and also might like a step in the shower better for her mobility issues", "NTA. Both of those spaces sound really great. I think since Megan eats with you, she should consider moving to the basement. That way Jenna could cook for her family and it wouldn't be as much of an inconvenience as having her trying to cook in your kitchen and haul it upstairs or have them take over your kitchen while cooking & eating.

Yes, it\u2019s your home, and you can choose how to use it, but you could have at least talked to Megan about why things were changing. I can\u2019t blame her for being upset- she\u2019s going from basically having her own apartment to a basement bedroom. The reasons your giving the MIL suite to Jenna (privacy) are the same reasons Megan probably enjoys living there. You mentioned she uses the kitchen and bathtub as well- so those activities are being relegated to a shared space. That, honestly, really sucks for her. \n\nShould she be understanding and kind about it? Sure. Is she obligated to like being kicked out of a space she considered hers for something less private without warning? No. \n\nI\u2019m sure there will be people be sayin N T A because Megan doesn\u2019t own the space and is \u201cacting entitled\u201d but I honestly think anyone who gets moved out of their living space with no warning has the right to be a bit upset about it.", "    NTA.

It might be your right, but when egos are involved how you do things is as important as what you do.\n\nMegan is obviously a smart young woman, sit her down and explain all your reasoning, ask her why she is so set against moving and listen to her answer, hopefully feeling that she's being listened to will be enough - and if there are bugs, get that sorted before she moves, no one wants to sleep with bugs!

You didn\u2019t even ask Megan, you just said what was going to happen. I\u2019d be pretty upset by that too.

If your other sister doesn't know which floor she'll have, she'll be happy with the currently unoccupied floor. You think the basement would be better for your current housemate but she disagrees. She's studying for her masters, disrupting her home environment is going to have some impact. She shouldn't have snapped at you or anything, but all you can do is ask her if she'd be willing to move, and be prepared to evict her if you still want your own way when she declines.", "Come on YTA , you didn\u2019t even think to inform her that you were planning on moving another person who has needs in with their spouse? When you live with ppl you talk things like this over and at that you\u2019re expecting her to give up her personal space and move , I\u2019d be mad too if you chose to communicate last minute, when you live with people that\u2019s what you have to do .

She's taking this waaaaay further than is reasonable.", "NTA \n\nIf you are the only one paying for the house and expenses then you don't owe anything to Megan. If she honestly believes that your (fully renovated) basement isn't a suitable place to live then why would she want her disabled sister and her two year old child to end up there instead? It sounds like she resents Jenna from her comments and is taking this decision personally when in reality it's the most logical and compassionate option.\n\nMegan will probably be upset about it for a while but ultimately she will be fine in the basement. Free housing with meal service is a damn good arrangement even if the floor isn't carpeted.", "Can you answer their edit\n\n>You say the basement is completely finished. Does it really have more bugs than the other two floors?", "Megan does not pay rent and neither would Jenna. She lives with me because I live very close to her university. She picked it with the intent of living with me from the start. She has lived with us since she was 18. This way she can focus on school not bills or anything else. \n\nMy sister was in a bad car accident when she was younger than caused my mom to stay with her for a year when my sister was 10. This was very hard for her and she has been in therapy since for her feelings of abandonment. Other than that I have not noticed favoritism but I am completely open to understanding that I may not notice it since I'm not experiencing it.", "I definitely thinks it\u2019s worth asking Jenna what she would prefer because of her disability and having a toddler. Lugging a 2 year old, diaper bag, laundry, etc.  (and their stroller if it can\u2019t be left anywhere else) up to a 3rd floor can be a lot even without a disability. Plus being in the third floor the kid\u2019s normal activities could be loud whereas in the basement the kid can be more active without disturbing anyone below.", "Ask Jenna about her specific needs. A walk in shower is usually more accessible than a tub. Especially if it\u2019s big enough to have a bench.", "Ask the disabled person what they need and defer to that.  Give her the specifics of both situations and let her decide.", "It does. I have some mobility issues & would actually prefer the downstairs. If my legs give out narrower stairwells are better & fewer steps are ALWAYS appreciated, even if it's steeper.", "That's all well and good, if you want to be a doormat. Your sister is already benefiting greatly from your generosity. If I treated my sister such, and then she started making demands, like which part of the house she would live in rent-free, she would swiftly be out the door and on her own.", "Jenna isn't trying to dictate in which space she will live rent-free, either. She's actually grateful to have a place to live.", "All of that is true as far as it goes, but everyone who lives in a place is likely to think of it as their own. Not even in the sense of being \"my property\" so much as the sense of being \"my home.\" \n\nMegan is being kicked out of her home, so her older sister can have it. Yes, she's being offered another place, right downstairs... but that isn't *home* to her, so of course she's unhappy. \n\nI still think it's reasonable that she move so that the family who's going to make use of the kitchen, and that kind of thing, have the upstairs apartment. But it's not unreasonable that she's upset about it, and it should have been handled tactfully with her. However rational and necessary it is that it happen, nobody is going to enjoy having to give up a home they loved, even if they're being offered a different one. The new place may be a perfectly reasonable place to live, but it isn't HOME.", "Not only living there rent free in what amounts to a very nice little apartment, but getting all her meals cooked for her, too!", "Exactly. She is still receiving a massive favor from her sister. Free lodging and cooking??? Who cares if she was there first? She is a guest, period, and has no entitlement to any of the house at all.", "Hence why i said twice, she is not obligated to do so, just because its your place doesnt mean the only option has to be your way or the highway straight up...  \n\nAnd you're spinning your own fiction when you feel the only end response from asking is \"yeah, I really wasn't asking'... not saying she must, but why wouldnt someone get an input? Nothing wrong with that.\n\nIf she still says no, at least, you heard her out, and you made that decision according to that, to me it beats just telling because you can... That's counter productive in my humble opinion.\n\nI've been in situations where i could just tell how things are going to be, but instead i asked for input and opinions first, and people appreciated that... this is just an opinion and piece of advice, she doesnt have to take, but in the long run, i know that mindset does pay off:)", "The point is she's settled, there's no real issue if she doesn't move other than OP thinks she'd prefer it in the basement.", "Shiii , with the way the talk abt it , yeah , I just go of the vibe the post give,they both hate the dayum basement , she\u2019s also planning on putting a gym in there , so yeah , she can just tell the girl to move atp", "I sure did. Thank you.", "Oops. Missed it. No. I wouldn't say so. We (my husband and I) spend most of our time in the family room in the basement and we sometimes see spiders but that's any room of a house I feel. She did see a centipede once while doing her laundry and that freaked her out pretty bad.", "I believe the upstairs floor is the 2nd floor, not the 3rd. It's a 3-floor house including the basement.", "Fair enough, but if she persists in making everything miserable then she can find her own home.", "What? Did you even read the post? And who taught you how to type?!", "It's totally finished with two bedrooms, a bathroom, a bar and a family room. She may or may not put a gym in it, but there's more than enough for one and space for someone to comfortably live in...for free.", "Sorry to take so long to get back to this.\n\nNAH.\n\nWhat?\n\nYeah. That surprised me, too.\n\nI went into detail of why I voted the way I did. It\u2019s long. Here\u2019s the key takeaway: Talk to Megan and really listen to her. You\u2019re still free to do what you want. But give her a chance to be heard.\n\nGood luck to you and yours. You are the sister I aspire to be. \n\n1.\t You obviously get along with your younger sister to be willing to house Megan + dog rent-free. The fact that you\u2019re adding Jenna + family rent-free to the mix warrants waiving the \u201ccandidates must be deceased for five years\u201d requirement to begin the canonization process.\n2.\tMoving is a major stressor. I can see why Megan is upset about moving, particularly now that the semester has started. Uprooting one\u2019s home base SUCKS. Even if it\u2019s just two floors away. Yes, it is your + husband\u2019s house so y\u2019all have final say over it. **BUT\u2026** talking to Megan about the situation before talking to Jenna would have been ideal. What\u2019s done is done, though. What can you do at this point? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m not really sure, but maybe try having a very honest conversation with Megan? Ask and listen to her feelings regarding the situation. Hell, she might even have a solution that works better for everyone. Who knows? I don\u2019t (that\u2019s what I **do** know). Maybe even apologize for not talking to her before talking to Jenna. That said, I do NOT think you should apologize for opening your home to Jenna + family. Sorry. I\u2019m going to stand with husband on the \u201cmy house\u201d rule here. **You and he** get to choose whom y\u2019all invite to live with you.\n3.\tYes, Megan is 23. Yes, she had some trauma with her mom leaving her for over a year when she was younger. It\u2019s important to not discount her feelings. And, sure, I WANT to say something to her like, \u201cPut on your big girl panties and bear witness to the incredibly awesome act that your sister and brother-in-law are performing! Reliable accounts of miracles are important in the canonization process!\u201d But I ALSO know that saying something like that isn\u2019t going to help Megan get over those feelings. Anyway, she gets to feel how she feels. Now, how she *acts* on those feelings is another matter entirely. Being snarky/petulant and saying something like how she\u2019s tired of the family catering to Jenna isn\u2019t terribly constructive. But, again, we need to keep in mind the age gap between Jenna and Megan. *Presuming* Jenna left for college at 18, that would mean that Megan was 7 years old when Jenna no longer lived at home full-time. Let\u2019s also keep in mind that OP presumably stopped living at home full-time at 18, essentially making Megan an only child at 9 years old. So, let\u2019s stop and think about that. You are a 13-year-old girl when your mom takes off for a year to be with someone you might not remember all that much from your childhood. Maybe you only see this person a couple of times a year. Big sister is a GROWNUP. Why does Mom need to live far away with this grownup and not be around to be mom to a young girl? Yeah, I absolutely see why Megan needed (and likely still needs) therapy. That sense of abandonment/loss might possibly also get exacerbated when she experiences larger upheavals in her life. Maybe. That\u2019s just a guess. But to me, changing living areas is a major upheaval.\n4.\tI\u2019m not a fan of bugs (having hedgehogs has helped with that). If you asked me in my early 20s to move into a space where I thought the likelihood of bug interaction was going to be higher than my current living space, you bet I\u2019d be freaked out and upset. And it probably would have taken a lot of time and effort to convince me that the bug occurrence rate wasn\u2019t really higher in the new space than it was in the old space.\n5.\tI get you\u2019re trying to do right by your sisters, and I REALLY appreciate that. As such, after you talk with Megan, talk with Jenna. If Jenna hasn\u2019t visited your current house yet, give her a video tour. Ask her which area is going to be easier for her to navigate. She might surprise you and tell you she would **prefer** the basement. Who knows? Sure, the kitchen in the upstairs area is pretty cool and isn\u2019t really being used right now, but navigating the stairs might be more of a concern to her.", "So the laundry room is down in the basement? So she will still not have privacy down there, since everyone will be down there daily to their laundry? Or is the laundry in a completely separate area with so that she can lock the door and keep everyone out? Will the noise from the laundry be disturbing her studies and tests?", "Well, sure. But is she \"making everything miserable,\" or is she simply being understandably upset about being kicked out of her own home with little warning? She's not entitled not to go, but she's within reason to be upset, I think. \n\nAlso, there may be a certain amount of burying the lede in this post. Megan objected to a basement with \"bugs and no carpet.\" No carpet is a mild nuisance in a chilly basement, but not a big deal, but *are* there bugs? What kind? How many? Might make sense to get an exterminator in before anyone at all has to live down there. I wouldn't want to move from a bugless top floor to a buggy basement either.", "I lied about the ages in the original post a bit for privacy. Clearly defaulted to the correct ages on accident. My younger sister is currently 23 the accident happened when my younger sister was 10 so 13 years ago. My older sister is actually 37 not 34 like the post says. They have a 14 year gap and yes my sister was a full blown grown up for most of my youngers life. Megan was a whoopsie baby.", "So the laundry room is down in the basement? So she will still not have privacy down there, since everyone will be down there daily to their laundry? Or is the laundry in a completely separate area with so that she can lock the door and keep everyone out? Will the noise from the laundry be disturbing her studies and tests?\n\nAlso will she have to deal with them on the rest of the private areas? If they are downstairs, will they be using the common bathroom or will they be expected to go back upstairs?", "The basement does not (in my opinion) have a bug problem. We hang out down there basically every day in the family room and I've only ever seen the normal amount of bugs one would see in a house. My sister saw a centipede in the laundry room once and understandably freaked out.", "D\u2019oh! Sorry for not putting 2 + 2 together regarding privacy. Hopefully this thread is too deep for most people to read.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019m cool with deleting that post script from my reply and just using one set of ages and please delete your comment if you\u2019d like.", "The laundry room is actually like a walk in closet off of the family room in the basement. I don't think it would be too disruptive but I understand it may be. \n\nNo the basement room has a private en suite bathroom so whoever has the downstairs room will need to use the common kitchen and the laundry room but everything else would be private.", "Well, I'm not sure what you consider \"the normal amount of bugs one would see in a house.\" But I do know that I see a big difference between the number of bugs I'm comfortable tolerating in the place where I go once a week to do the laundry and the number I'm comfortable tolerating in the place where I go to sleep every night. You might want to offer your sister an exterminator's evaluation of the basement and treatment of anything they find, if that might help her accept sleeping down there.", "NTA it\u2019s your home and I will tell her if she keeps acting like this, you can kick her out she\u2019s not entitled to anything.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. Yes she is not paying for rent and she absolutely should be grateful to have a space to live.but any person would be upset to simply\nhave someone announce they are moving out of their space. If that was how that conversation went than ESH. Should have been a collaborative conversation where you talked with her about it even if the final decision was yours.", "YTA", "YTA  It is your house but she has been living there for some time. You stuck your nose in to help your other sister and thats kind but it wasnt necessary.  \n\nNow because you invited more people into your home, you feel this is your other sisters issue.\n\nNo its your issue that you created.\n\nYou technically can make her move but IMO it would be a jerk move, making you a bigger AH and cause tension with all 3 of you,", "She is not paying a dime. OP even buys the sisters dog food and pay the vet bills.", "So apart from uprooting Megan from her space you\u2019re also depriving her of her privacy because you expect yourself, husband, Jenna and her husband to be able to access it whenever you want to do laundry?", "The laundry room is in the basement not the specific room I want her to move to. She would never have people in her room unless she wanted them."]}
