Putting cameras in the closets sounds like symptoms of schizophrenia. \n\nI think instead of going with the idea of thinking he's a creep maybe consider he needs mental help?

Thats pretty creepy to put up that many cameras inside the house without asking, how can that much be for security especially if its just you guys living there?", "NTA that\u2019s super creepy of him. If it was just common living spaces then fine, whatever. But to secretly put cameras up in the bedrooms? Yuck. Gross. Very disturbing and weird.", "NTA. Cameras in the bedrooms and closets are not for security.", "The fuck? Why the closets?? Putting cameras up without your mom\u2019s permission makes your brother an asshole. Putting up crazy amounts that infringe on everyone\u2019s privacy is another asshole move. I understand the living room and kitchen though. But the closet? I don\u2019t think Sully is gonna come out of it. Might want to check bathrooms though.", "NTA.\n\n1) In common spaces in *one's own home*, fine.\n2) Bedrooms, bathrooms, a hard no in any home you might, maybe, possibly anticipate visitors.\n3) Closets, why?\n4) In a home where you (*royal you*, mind) are not the primary renter, no.\n5) In a home where you are not the primary renter, & have not asked for & ***recieved*** permission to install them, no.\n6) In a home where you've not notified/informed any other residents of their presence, no.\n\nUgh", "NTA.\n\nBut he won't be moving out as your mom will likely relent unless this is the straw that broke the camel's back and she's really had enough of the mental health issues he refuses to get help for (probably because he has no insight and everyone else is the problem).\n\nCameras in the main living areas I can understand.  The issue is he didn't tell anyone they were there.  Cameras in the bedroom are okay if they are approved and everyone knows they are there... but even so, this is a very gray area.  You would want cameras controlled by the owner of the bedroom and they can turn them off when they are in there - so just turned on when they are not.\n\nGuest bedroom is creepy, closets are even creepier.  I would get an expert to check the bathrooms in case you missed one.", "NTA. To put in cameras in communal areas is super weird & controlling but once they go into bedrooms it becomes incredibly creepy.", "NTA. Doorbell is fine, rooms with an outside door are fine, kitchen and living room is getting a little strange but only a problem because he didn't tell your mother he was doing it.\n\nThe bedrooms are completely out of line.", "NTA,and yuck even the bedrooms", "Hang on, he lives with your mother? And he's put up cameras in bedrooms? Communal areas is fine, if she's aware he's done it, but bedrooms and closets is definitely taking it too far, check the bathrooms. He's clearly installed concealed cameras and not your usual security type cameras. NTA", "NTA bro needs checked by the cops though", "NTA. You should buy an RF detector and check the entire house. Your brother is a creep. Best of Luck.", "because he's very territorial and made it so bad that no one wants to stay there ever so we think of it as his", "I guess their mom lives somewhere else?", "if this is a true story then yes, yes he is.", "yeah he has a lot of mental help issues but refuses to get therapy or go to doctor or anything.  tried many times but he refuses", "when did i ever say it was my brothers house", "I\u2019d have kicked him out way before this but this is really messed up.

That is creepy..sorry", "Who's THAT clueless about privacy?", "My kid set up a camera in their bedroom in my house, without asking permission or telling anyone.
