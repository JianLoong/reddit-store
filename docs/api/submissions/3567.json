Look for peep holes.\n\nEdit: NTA \nHe's a peeping tom. Since your mother didnt know, he was spying on her. Sounds like a weird perv.", "Yep, that many cameras in those specific places (bedrooms/closets), he's streaming that stuff online somewhere.", "\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "Yes this right here and maybe this is just me but if you\u2019re going to put up security cameras for protection wouldn\u2019t you normally put them on the outside of the house??? Or am I missing something \n\nNTA", "He owns the house his an asshole but he can put them up", "Maybe he saw that old horror move where the menacing calls were coming from inside the house?\n\nNTA", "He lives in their mom\u2019s house. That\u2019s why he\u2019s getting kicked out.", "And bathrooms! I saw a Reddit last week where the stepdad put a camera in his stepdaughter\u2019s shower head. \ud83d\ude2c", "Yeah, they're gonna find mom in a jar one of these trips", "[deleted]", "nobody said that", "He wants to catch the clothes hangers multiplying. \ud83d\ude05", "Clothes hanger porn. Omg!", "NTA", "NTA. Call the police on this creep.", "NTA creepy\u2026 glad he is getting kicked out.", "NTA\n\nThis is wild. First of all, putting cameras in private spaces is super fucking weird. Why on earth would he need a camera in his mothers room?\n\nBut even worse it\u2019s NOT EVEN HIS HOUSE.", "NTA. Aside from just being skeezy, filming someone in a location with a reasonable expectation of privacy (e.g., a bedroom) without that person\u2019s knowledge is illegal in most jurisdictions.", "NTA. Check the vents in the bathrooms for cameras as well.", "In lots of places this is illegal. It is especially illegal if he does not own the house. NTA. Also, be wary of this stuff in the future and keep any kids and other vulnerable folks (including your mother if elderly and vulnerable) away from him.", "I have a camera in our spare bedroom, originally in there for kittens when they were kept apart from the house until they were bigger. My MIL stayed there last week. Not only did I unplug it, I put the unit in a closet under stuff, just so she wouldn\u2019t think it was plugged in. A live camera in a closet is WEIRD.\nNTA", "NTA- he\u2019s his this from your mom who is the actual home owner which doesn\u2019t make sense if they were for security. Why would he hide them from your mom if the reason for having them was innocent also if it\u2019s for security reasons why hide them in the closet? Start checking bathrooms and again in the bedrooms asap. Also did he hide them in your moms room?!? He\u2019s 30 years old and is way to old to be pulling crap like that.", "OP=NTA\n\nYour brother is not just an A-H, but he's a freaking creep too.  If he really meant this for security he would have TOLD his mother(and anyone sleeping in a relevant bedroom).\n\nEWWWWW!!!!", "NTA. It\u2019s your moms house and he didn\u2019t tell her?", "NTA and your brother is creepy.", "Somewhere out there is a website where he was streaming all this.  NTA", "I'd want to know where the video was going, who was watching it, if it was being stored, and if it were being shared out in any way.", "scams? or scans?", "It's a very short post, dude.  Try reading it.", "Where does it say he owns the house? It said he lives with his Mom and Mom is kicking him out because of it.", "My (step) niece\u2019s stepdad had cameras set inside the knobs on the medicine cabinet of niece\u2019s bathroom, and another parallel to the monitor-mounted camera on her computer.\n\nEmbedded in the knobs of her closet door and bedroom door.\n\nHe was trading the videos with other like minded men and boys.\n\nDon\u2019t go to the cops, go to the State Troopers. Local cops are more likely to take less action, the troopers don\u2019t give a fuck about local connections.\n\nYes, stepdad is in prison, not jail. Since it was across state lines, the troopers got the FBI involved.", "Do you mean Scream? \n\nDid you call Scream an old movie?", "Sorry to break it to you, friend, but Scream came out over a quarter century ago.", "no, the original reference is to When a Stranger Calls.", "omg...WHEN did that happen?? lol", "@charlatan_red YOU TAKE THAT BACK - my god.
