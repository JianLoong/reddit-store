If you\u2019re not sure she\u2019ll believe you, maybe pick up one of BIL\u2019s calls and let your wife listen in, so she can hear for herself. DON\u2019T let her pay for the wedding. Hell, tell BIL\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, too. Best case scenario there won\u2019t even BE a wedding.

If this is the view he holds, it\u2019s likely to be the view he will have if, god forbid, his wife has fertility issues. You wouldn\u2019t be telling your wife out of ruining BIL\u2019s wedding, you would be telling her because you two are a partnership.

Her brother \"Matt\" is getting married this year and she promised to fund the wedding.

He went on about how kids are important and \"advised\" me to go knock some chic up and have a kid so my lineage won't be cut off. He said my wife, his sister won't leave me but she'll be around to raise the kids since she's desperate, and won't divorce me because no man will want to get together with a 35+ inferitle woman so that's a \"win win\". I was shocked by what he said. Seeing the other guys laughing I thought it was a joke but he said he was \"for real\". I snapped and started arguing with him saying he was out of line to say this about his sister, who is paying for his wedding. He told me he was just giving \"advice\" but I told him that I'll tell her what he said. He freaked out and begged me not to because then there won't be a wedding and this will cause problems between him and his fiancee. More importantly, it will ruin his relationship with his sister. He said he loves her and doesnt want her to be upset. I left immediately.\n\n\nHe keeps calling but I keep hanging up.
