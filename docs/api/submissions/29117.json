My wife feels like we should use it for the family or save it. I tried to explain that I do feel I should be free to use my work bonus as I wish. She is calling me selfish and claims I do not understand what marriage means. \n\nI see no issue with a bonus being used solely by the person who earned it. I told her if she got a bonus I would not question what she did with it. She then replied if I got one I would use it for us as a family. \n\nAm I the asshole and in the wrong here?

Yes, marriage is a partnership etcetera.  But a marriage is also two individuals.  Having something for yourself isn't selfish,  it's important for your mental health.

It can be saved or spent as you or her wish and there would be no accounting for it to each other at all.

Doesn't matter who earns more. This is the set up you agreed on.\n\nBut now that you get a bonus, you're going back on the agreement and using bad logic to justify it. Even as a reward for hard work, a bonus is still a part of your overall compensation at your job. What this means is now your wife sees that you are perfectly happy to break your current set up if it's going to be something that benefits just you. \n\nYou've decided to be in a relationship with combined finances.

If it's a few hundred dollars, have fun with it. But if you got something in the thousands... I think it's fair of her to expect some of it to go to savings or family use.

Your company gave you a bonus as a 'gift' for good work. Yeah it's included in your salary, but a bonus is a GIFT. If your wife expect this 'bonus' to go to the family, then any bonus she might get at this job or any other job should also go to the 'family' but I bet money that if she ever got a bonus, she'd want to use it on herself and not put it towards the family. Women are funny about that kind of stuff, they want all the man's money to be shared, but if the tables are turned then that is different and she can only use it on herself. Some might consider it is misogynistic but it isn't by any means.\n\nReminds me of a video I saw once, a couple are at the store buying groceries and the man wants to buy a case of beer, the wife says no because it cost too much ($10.99) and he puts it back angrily. Next thing is he finds a package of make up and asks about it and that it costs almost $30), she says it makes her pretty to which he reply's \"so does the beer for $10.99\". Now that might be bad, but it proves a point....if the woman wants it, the cost is not an issue, but if the guy wants it then it costs too much. Same point here.....you want something to use on yourself snd she says no, but wants the money to go to the 'family' which pretty much means she wants to use it on herself. Screw that\n\nput your foot down and tell her this is money that YOU earned as a gift from your employer and you are entitled to use it as you feel fit for yourself - she won't like it but she cannot dictate everything you do with YOUR money, whether it's joint finances or not. It's not joint if she's trying to control all of it", "You got that bonus at work because you busted your ass for it, unless she somehow assisted she isn\u2019t entitled to it.

This is my first job in my field after school. We recently had a performance review and I got a raise and bonus. My wife feels like my bonus should be considered family money. My wife does not get monetary bonuses at her job, she works on an hourly rate. I also do earn more, and pay a higher percentage of our household expenses.\n\nWe got into it because I wanted to keep my bonus and use it on myself. My wife feels like we should use it for the family or save it. I tried to explain that I do feel I should be free to use  my work bonus as I wish. She is calling me selfish and claims I do not understand what marriage means. \n\nI see no issue with a bonus being used solely by the person that earned it. I told her if she got a bonus I would not question what she did with it. She then replied if I got one I would use it for us as a family. \n\nAm I the asshole and in the wrong here? If I am considered to be, I will go apologize to her tonight. \n\nWe are both 26, no kids.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We keep a little for ourselves as a \"treat yourself,\" then the rest is put towards the household. And usually we say something to the other person about how we're going to spend the money. Like, I got a bonus last year of around $900 after all the taxes were taken out, so I asked my husband if I could buy a switch with a portion of the money, then the rest would go towards the house. Same went for him with any bonuses he got. I got a bonus once that was taxed all to hell and was basically pointless to get, so that all just went to the house. We pick and choose, but we always save the option for a \"treat yourself with your bonus money\"", "Pretty much this. If the bonus is an unexpected variance you don\u2019t rely on then I think it\u2019s 100% justified to treat yourself a little.

Community property states might say differently.", "I am leaning towards saving it and putting it towards my dream car fund. \n\nNo debt to speak of, outside a mortgage payment and her car lease payment.
