My wife feels like we should use it for the family or save it. I tried to explain that I do feel I should be free to use my work bonus as I wish. She is calling me selfish and claims I do not understand what marriage means. \n\nI see no issue with a bonus being used solely by the person who earned it. I told her if she got a bonus I would not question what she did with it. She then replied if I got one I would use it for us as a family. \n\nAm I the asshole and in the wrong here?

Yes, marriage is a partnership etcetera.  But a marriage is also two individuals.  Having something for yourself isn't selfish,  it's important for your mental health.

Even as a reward for hard work, a bonus is still a part of your overall compensation at your job. What this means is now your wife sees that you are perfectly happy to break your current set up if it's going to be something that benefits just you. \n\nYou've decided to be in a relationship with combined finances.

If it's a few hundred dollars, have fun with it. But if you got something in the thousands... I think it's fair of her to expect some of it to go to savings or family use.

Your company gave you a bonus as a 'gift' for good work. Yeah it's included in your salary, but a bonus is a GIFT. If your wife expect this 'bonus' to go to the family, then any bonus she might get at this job or any other job should also go to the 'family' but I bet money that if she ever got a bonus, she'd want to use it on herself and not put it towards the family. Women are funny about that kind of stuff, they want all the man's money to be shared, but if the tables are turned then that is different and she can only use it on herself. Some might consider it is misogynistic but it isn't by any means.\n\nReminds me of a video I saw once, a couple are at the store buying groceries and the man wants to buy a case of beer, the wife says no because it cost too much ($10.99) and he puts it back angrily. Next thing is he finds a package of make up and asks about it and that it costs almost $30), she says it makes her pretty to which he reply's \"so does the beer for $10.99\". Now that might be bad, but it proves a point....if the woman wants it, the cost is not an issue, but if the guy wants it then it costs too much. Same point here.....you want something to use on yourself snd she says no, but wants the money to go to the 'family' which pretty much means she wants to use it on herself. Screw that\n\nput your foot down and tell her this is money that YOU earned as a gift from your employer and you are entitled to use it as you feel fit for yourself - she won't like it but she cannot dictate everything you do with YOUR money, whether it's joint finances or not. It's not joint if she's trying to control all of it", "You got that bonus at work because you busted your ass for it, unless she somehow assisted she isn\u2019t entitled to it.

This is my first job in my field after school. We recently had a performance review and I got a raise and bonus. My wife feels like my bonus should be considered family money. My wife does not get monetary bonuses at her job, she works on an hourly rate. I also do earn more, and pay a higher percentage of our household expenses.\n\nWe got into it because I wanted to keep my bonus and use it on myself. My wife feels like we should use it for the family or save it. I tried to explain that I do feel I should be free to use  my work bonus as I wish. She is calling me selfish and claims I do not understand what marriage means. \n\nI see no issue with a bonus being used solely by the person that earned it. I told her if she got a bonus I would not question what she did with it. She then replied if I got one I would use it for us as a family. \n\nAm I the asshole and in the wrong here? If I am considered to be, I will go apologize to her tonight. \n\nWe are both 26, no kids.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

E.g., maybe a portion goes to bills, a portion to savings, a portion to a joint family fund, and a portion to an individual allowance for each of you that can be put toward things just for you. This keeps you both happy, by yourselves and with each other. Then you don't need to wait for bonuses and try to make a case for why she should get no say -- instead, you would already be getting a regular percentage of joint income, bonus included, that lets you save up for these kinds of purchases for yourself. So does she, so she can't complain. Sometimes couples don't need this kind of breakdown to avoid resentment and confusion, but some do, and there's nothing wrong with that. \n\n(If you feel like you can't purchase what you want without a big dumb amount of money, and you aren't willing to save toward it... well, yeah, then maybe consider it's a bad idea.)", "NTA - depending on how you proposed it.

Technically I bring home the larger paycheck but it\u2019s never *my* paycheck- it\u2019s ours.", "This literally penalizes your wife twice. Not only does she not have access to the bonus money, but you\u2019re pretending the bonus isn\u2019t part of your income which it absolutely is. So you\u2019re not taking it into account when you split the bills. \n\nIf you were splitting the bills 60% to 40%, depending on the size of that bonus, it could easily shift the way bills should be split to 65% to 35%. But instead you\u2019re just acting like all that bonus money should be yours AND it doesn\u2019t count towards your income. Literally stuffing your wife twice.", "Well you have now", "I do this too. Gift for me, gift for him.", "I literally am watching g a show where the boss gives a guy a bonus and he says \"go buy your wife something nice\". A person can do that and still treat themselves", "So I recently had two windfalls. One was from my congregation (I'm a pastor, and it's pastor appreciation month). $250, it went to a family expense. Did I feel cheated? A little, as the Last one was used in the same way. \n\nThe second windfall: My aunt left me $10K when she passed last year. $2500 is going into my IRA, $2500 into my wife's IRA, $2500 for my wife to do whatever she'd like with, and $2500 for me to do the same.\n\nIf my wife told me that all $10K needed to go to the household (IRAs, or bills), I'd be beyond hurt. There's a few things I've been wanting for a while now but haven't had the finances, and 25% for myself isn't too much, imo.\n\nThe big problem here is that they're both approaching this as all-or-nothing. Either it all goes to the household, or it all goes to OP. Probably the best thing to do is split it between the two; of not 50/50, then 60/40 or close to.

Sorry.  Your bonus is part of your paycheck.  If you were a stay at home dad, or working at a job without bonuses and your wife got a big bonus and said, hon stay home with the kids I\u2019m going to Hawaii, or I\u2019m buy myself a diamond bracelet.

Last time I got an unexpected windfall I bought my partner a bunch of presents because *I love buying presents for him*", "I just did my job to the best of my ability if that is enough to get notice and a bonus awesome. Even if no bonus was at play I would still be doing my job to the best of my ability. \n\nUnless you are saying I should be cynical and view my bonus as something I am entitled to because it is not. I am not entitled to a bonus, and I refuse to treat it like an expectation when it is not. \n\nYou can shit my view all you want, but it was nice to receive and to be noticed and acknowledged. Even if they did not, I will not adopt this cynical work view many posters seem to have.\n\nIt was shocking because I just did my job, but I guess in their eyes I did my job well enough to receive something extra. That is how I view it, not going to take the wind out of my sail.", "Why should he?\n\nThey've never had a discussion about this, apparently. They should have, but they didn't. That said, they agreed to a division of income and expenses that works for them, pays their bills, allows them to save, and has kept them both happy. This money falls outside that agreement, but comes from the same source as some money that falls within that agreement (his work). It's nuanced, but he really should be the one deciding where it goes, because he earned it. \n\nIn my view (and apparently in his), bonuses fall into a similar category as inheritances or gifted money. It is not part of the same agreement that divides base income, unless it has explicitly been made part of that agreement. It feels to me like his wife is being greedy here, honestly, trying to bring that money within her control. Bonuses are not salary, they're even *taxed* differently. \n\nHonestly I think OP and his wife need to set up both a joint pool of money and their own separate 'fun' ones, and have some discussions about how odd things like lottery winnings, inheritance, bonuses, and gifts should be divided.\n\nedit: All this 'it's not worth a divorce over' talk applies just as much to her as it does to him. In the end, however, I think clarity and mutual agreement over financial matters are *definitely* worth considering divorce over, because disagreements will fester and cause resentment.", "My husband gets a quarterly bonus and the one around Xmas time is usually a little bigger. Since the recent economic downturn his bonuses don\u2019t quite cover how much we\u2019ve fallen behind each quarter. Forget keeping it for himself, it\u2019s a necessary part of our income.", "Hahaha same. We got some retro pay recently and I was like oh hello debt and that\u2019s where it all went.", "Why would you need a second PS5 lol?", "It is not growing I just never originally gave a range, nor do I think I gave one now.", "She has her own job.

LOL", "I am no longer working extra jobs, but when I did I still did my fair share.", "Logistically enjoyment money is mostly my income. Since we have an agreement to do what we can to max out retirement contributions and a flat 20% of our earned income goes into savings. She does not have much left for fun and stuff after doing that and covering her car payment.\n\nSo she is free to use the third account as her fun money. We each have an allocated amount for personal enjoyment but she is free to go over I do not sweat it.\n\nI have always been the one to mostly fun our trips even before getting this job, I would work multiple jobs to do so.", "She\u2019s getting the pleasure of his company, surely that\u2019s enough?", "Bingo!", "Do you think she would be able to go without his income and do what she wants?", "You're looking way too deep into that. I wouldn't take your advice either.", "It is true though.", "This is how I do it as well except he never wants anything so I usually get myself or the household one nice thing and then rest just goes straight to savings because frankly, I don\u2019t need the whole freaking bonus to treat myself.", "Is this the \"the fall of the house of usher\" by any chance?", "My husband and I haven\u2019t told our families that we\u2019re already married.

Just because they are married , it doesn't mean they do and have everything together.", ">Unless you are saying I should be cynical and view my bonus as something I am entitled to because it is not.\n\nNo, it's the complete opposite. It's an unexpected windfall. When that happened to me recently, I bought some presents for my partner, **because I like him**, spent about the same amount money on myself, paid off debt, and bought some stuff for our new place. You're doing marriage wrong, bud.\n\nLast time I got a bonus at work, which I personally worked my ass off for, I was happy to be recognized for my work *and* happy to have more money to share with my partner, and that was *before* we combined finances.

Baldurs gate 3 is an example.  And going from no loading (ps5) to so much loading (ps4) is rough.  \n\nIf I had a second ps5 upstairs I could play whenever I wanted, on a faster console, and it would replace the ps4.    \n\nI admit it\u2019s a want more than a need, and it\u2019s definitely not a priority at all.  But I want it and also admit I can\u2019t justify the expense while there are a number of other \u201cfamily\u201d things it could go towards.", "It doesn't necessarily mean overtime, but it's far more likely than not that it did. You typically get a bonus by going above and beyond yes? He very likely had to do more than the standard amount of work to earn it, in which case she would have had to do extra work at home because he wouldn't have been able to pull his weight there.

So if you make $60K and she makes $40K/year, then EVERY BUDGET CATEGORY is funded 60% by you and 40% by her. Both you and your wife should have EQUAL amounts of fun money set aside each month. This is what it means to be married. If you decided to do something different this is your choice, but legally, if you were getting divorced, this is how it\u2019s looked at - all her income and all your income is both of yours for the time that you are married.", "OP would you take your head out of your ass and acknowledge the tsunami of YTA responses?

Luckily we are a team and all the money from all the incomes goes into 1 account and that's our money to budget for every expense.

I don't  think many understand marriage anymore.", "The point is that each of your \"fun money\" pools should also be equally funded, after taxes and after required deductions (or deductions you've both decided together are good ones to make, such as insurance and retirement contributions), and including all of your income: wages, bonuses, etc. Your household has $X total, regardless of whose check it originally came from.", "It\u2019s really not at all impossible to do. Let\u2019s say her annual salary is $50K, she maxes out her 401 K to the tune of $22,500, so we\u2019ll say her take home is $20K/year (after taxes, insurance, etc.). Hopefully you\u2019re also maxing out your 401K, so even if your gross is $100K/year pre tax let\u2019s say your take home is $58/year (after taxes, insurance, etc). \n\nThe fact is the amount doesn\u2019t really matter, the percentage matters.
