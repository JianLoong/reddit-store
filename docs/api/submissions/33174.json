Anyone taking offence for us, do one, ya numpty.  NTA, enjoy your poster buddy.", "I don't think it's discriminatory. It seems more symbolic to me. British is not to be taken in a literal sense.

An argument could be made.\n\nIs it discriminatory? Yes. It is making a clear statement that if a person comes from or identifies as British, they may not be granted service.

But in typical American fashion, you all screamed bloody murder at being forced to pay back your loans, and decided you'd be better off without. \n\nAnd to further reinforce my point, you also failed to repay the FRENCH for their assistance in your oh-so-noble-and-brave rebellion against the British crown. \n\nAs an Australian, this is such typical \"MERICA!\" bullshit. You all think you're the greatest thing to ever have come into existence, and completely ignore the damage, lies, cruelties and general horribleness that you, like _every_ nation, has perpetuated against other people, and your own. \n\nYou're not special. You're not smart. You're not unique flowers showing the world the best way to live. You're not the bastions of freedom and kindness you so desperately need to believe you are. \n\nThe downvotes I'm going to receive from all the Americans will only reinforce my point.
