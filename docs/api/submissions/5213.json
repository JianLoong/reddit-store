Sure, you didn't know about Eva when you married and had kids with your husband. And having a stepkid sprung on you out of the blue is jarring, but your husband feels the exact same way. Worse, probably, because he missed out on all this time with his daughter. Rather than having empathy for him and her, you're focused on not wanting a random kid. And if you're the type of person who doesn't want stepkids, then that's how you feel.

Glad to see I\u2019m not insane.", "What is it that you disagree with? I\u2019m speaking facts.", "The fact that he created her means, what?  His responsibility is to provide for her and teach her how to grow up to be a good human being. It\u2019s not a lifelong vow. \n\npeople who divorce or breaking the vow. That doesn\u2019t change the sanctity of the vow. And it\u2019s often due to the very issue I raised. People have kids and then stop nurturing their relationship.\n\nWhat makes more sense to put energy into: someone who\u2019s going to leave your house after 20 years or someone who\u2019s going to live with you for 70 or 80 years?", "Would def leave rather than raise i child i dont want to raise that i didn't birth \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd", "That seems unlikely if \"any\" man regularly uses protection. \n\nPerhaps it's slightly different but I'd be gone if it turned out my husband had a kid and wanted to raise it. I specifically make sure all my partners are with me on not wanting kids.", "Her children are not \"unsafe\" from a newly-abandoned 7-year-old. JFC. And their relative \"discomfort\" (if they even have any . . . the 1-year-old likely won't know the difference, the 3-year-old might actually be excited to gain a sibling, you have no idea) compared to THEIR HALF-SIBLING'S, WHO JUST LOST EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS, is asolutely negligible. This argument is absolutely ludicrous.\n\nOP is allowed to be shaken, and to say that this takes some getting used to. Trying to throw money at the issue, and suggesting that it is reasonable to ship a newly-abandoned 7-year-old \"abroad to school\" is the epitome of heartless and cruel. This is her husband's child, her childrens' half-sibling. This child poses no threat to anyone . . . she is the vulnerable one here, not OP, and not OP's children.", "Why is she evil? If she knew about the girl beforehand, then yes. But nobody knew. You aren't an ass just because you don't want to raise somebody's else child. Divorce him - you guys just don't have the same goals anymore. \n\nNTA", "I agree. I can\u2019t say I\u2019d be happy either having it come out of the blue, not expecting it at all, and then to know instantly that you\u2019re expected to just move another child in full time that essentially neither her or her husband even knows\u2026 that\u2019s a lot.", "The child didn\u2019t lie and claim they were aborted - an irresponsible parent did.\n\nChildren aren\u2019t responsible for being the sin\u2019s of their parents.\n\nChildren have the right to be loved and cared for by their parents. Only an AH who wants to abandon their kids would say otherwise.", "I don't necessarily disagree with your conclusion, but... lots of AH things are 'well within people's rights' to do.", "I actually plan to adopt a child when I have the financial means to do so. \n\nMy mum was adopted and it was her dream to adopt a child into our family but she passed away young and I plan to do that for her.\n\nAnd if it was my husband's child he didn't know about I would take it in. because I am a grown adult and that is the responsible thing to do, especially if you earn 700k a year.\n\nShe has no excuses!", "\n\n\"Um he has a responsibility to her kids because they're hers (???) AND his even if they divorce\"\n\nNo shit Sherlock, this child is also his. She would expect him to take care of *his other 2 children even if she wasn't in the picture or if he had started a new family*", "I would hope that op can remember having a child 7 years ago.\nHe's acting stressed out, because he also got lied to. It's not like he deliberately looked for the child to take her in. He found out and tries to not be a deadbeat who just ignores her to his own daughter. I don't think he is all that happy about the situation either", "He called her an AH because she suggested that they send the kid of to a boarding school. Out of sight out of mind. That is classic evil step mom vibes.", "He probably waited for the DNA test. I can get that because I\u2019m his eyes he wanted to make sure that the ex wasn\u2019t just trying to pawn off a random kid. Your last sentence is a giant assumption.", "no. the title says \"am i the ah for not wanting my husbands kids\", thats the question to my answer that she is not the ah. i did not make any judgement on the husband or anyone else but ops question.", "it does not. i merely answered her question. stop assuming stuff, jesus christ, leave me alone.", "Maybe it does. I wouldn\u2019t marry someone who didn\u2019t agree that kids come first, so I wouldn\u2019t know.", "But if you have to choose, you choose your young child. \n\nHis wife should be a sane person and realize that this has to happen because there\u2019s no other choice. He\u2019s actually legally obligated to take care of this child.", "In other words, you are.", "yeah i have emotional reactions to people spouting totally asinine bullshit, as you did. in what world is having emotions a bad thing? i get that you're a ghoul and think that a 7 year old should raise herself because her dad \"owes\" his spouse more than the human he created, but most people aren't like you. idk if you have heard of \"divorce\" but spouses leave all the time, and i have a feeling OPs husband will be one of them.", "We weren\u2019t told he asked. We were told Rose said she did. She might have done that because she didn\u2019t want him in her life anymore, not because he asked.", "Nope. As a parent you take on the life long responsibility of raising and caring for another human being. Maybe you would have a point if we are talking about a grown up but this is a child who needs adults to survive. The husband should prioritize the health and safety of a human that he created that cannot care for itself, over an adult that is not reliant on him.", "So what if they leave the house? They\u2019re still your child. A vow is just some pretty words that can be taken back at any time. In reality, it\u2019s worthless compared to the child you created. Marriages end all the time for all sorts of reasons, being a parent never ends. So my kids being around is more of a certainty than my partner. You\u2019ve got some messed up priorities.", "same. i don't want to be a mother in general but a step mother is a definite no. i have a step mom and god knows i don't want to traumatise a poor kid.", "That's true but as we all know, birth control is not 100%, not even vasectomies.", "Ya and this kid IS NOT HERS, Einstein. He has obligation to those kids but she doesn't have any obligations to this one whatsoever", "That\u2019s all very reasonable. But I also think the OP is not being unreasonable. This is a lot to process. She may come around in time. But right now, it\u2019s a massive shock. I dare say he would probably react very similarly if the situation were reversed. In general, men are less tolerant of another man\u2019s child that a woman is of another woman\u2019s child.", "Doesn\u2019t make it OK for him to call her name. This is a massive shock to her and he can\u2019t really critique how she handles it.", "It\u2019s not. At all.", "These replies are referencing the rules of the sub. N T A means OP is not an asshole but someone else is. N A H means nobody is an asshole. Y T A means OP is the asshole. Your reply is going to trigger the algorithm to count your judgment as someone else being the asshole. That's what they're trying to tell you. You can read the rules section for the explanation.", "In terms of sentence structure, you are correct. In terms of the actual usage of terms in this subreddit, visible over there in the sidebar, you're not. NAH is used when there's no assholes involved in the sitaution. \n\nNTA as used here is short for 'You're not the asshole, that other guy is'. That's why you see NAH when a couple has differing opinions on pets and NTA when someone writes in to ask if they're wrong for not wanting their spouse to give all their money away to relatives.\n\nPersonally, I don't really care either way since this isn't likely to be the top comment, which is the only time it matters, but wanted to put this so you wouldn't feel like you were being inexplicably hounded on this.", "Thats literally how this sub works.", "Then you will probably get a divorce if you put more energy into your kids than your partner.  feel free to Google the subject. You might be surprised at what you find.", "He is legally obligated to provide for the child. It doesn\u2019t mean he has to take her in.  We see scenarios on Reddit all the time of people who don\u2019t raise her biological children or who have some sort of other arrangement with them rather than the traditional parent child relationship. He could put her up for adoption. He could do a number of things. He is not obligated to bring her into his existing family.", "You\u2019re welcome to think what you like. Do you have anything else to discuss except for my possible identity?", "We\u2019re having a discussion. You need to set your emotions aside. Calling my comment \u201casinine bullshit\u201c isn\u2019t going to get us anywhere. It\u2019s not gonna make me respect your point of view.  Where did the OP say that the child should raise herself?\n\nEveryone has emotions; but is a bad thing to be ruled by your emotions. You can\u2019t think clearly when you are doing so.\n\nI doubt the husband would be so magnanimous if the OP suddenly brought home a seven-year-old from her previous husband.  He needs to give her time to process this instead of expecting her to immediately act like June Cleaver.", "Still, the father was told there was no child. Therefore, no responsibility. But like I said, it\u2019s now up to him and him alone to make that decision now. And if OP isn\u2019t okay with his decision, then she can decide on whether she wants to stay.", "You don\u2019t have a \u201clifelong\u201c responsibility to your child. Legally, it ends at 18. As a parent, one would hope that you would continue to be supportive and active in your child\u2019s life; but they are not your main priority. And if you maintain your marriage, then everything else will take care of itself.", "There is no need to take a personal shot at me. My priorities are none of your business. I am here discussing the topic and have not made any comments about you. \n\nBut I will explain it to you one more time: if you want someone to stay with you in your old age and nurse you, and clean up when you can\u2019t retain your bodily functions and all of the other stuff. Then you need to put the energy into them. Don\u2019t ask your kids to do it, because they will be busy with their own families.", "Oh absolutely it's a lot to process. I just don't like where she made the proposal to simply send the child away and just send her money. That is something you think about when you're in no position to even raise one child but not just because \"you don't want to\".", "You can 100% critique how someone handles it. OP is valid for her feelings and I get that it\u2019s a shock, but she made vows and if she will not honor said vows then she should not be in a marriage.", "Nobody is adopting a 7 year old. Get real. \n\nThere is almost no way she is mentally well enough or mature enough for boarding school. \n\nThis small child just got abandoned and by the sounds of it likely suffered years of neglect. She\u2019s going to be damaged and need help.\n\nIf OP\u2019s husband is willing to just abandon her, OP should be concerned that he will abandon her children, on a whim.", "We see those scenarios all the time because they generally cause trauma and conflict!", "Legally it ends at 18. Morally, it started when you decided to have a kid and never ends.", "So you\u2019re just a bad parent, then.", "I disagree. He put his wife in a extremely difficult position. He shouldn\u2019t expect her to immediately start making cookies for the new kid.\n\nShe did not sign up for an extra child.", "Where does it say no one will adopt a seven year old? That is still quite young. How do you know she\u2019s not mentally well enough for a boarding school? How about other family members?", "I totally disagree. Once you have raised a child and sent them out into the world, your obligation ends.  it\u2019s a nice bonus if you can continue to act as a parent to your adult child. But you\u2019re not morally obligated to do so.", "I honestly feel bad for her young children.  Looks like she plans on abandoning them once they turn 18 and they don't have a choice.", "You know nothing about my parenting and I could not care less what you think. I am not the subject of this post. Why don\u2019t you stick to the topic, which is not my parenting skills.", "She may not have signed up for it explicitly but this ties into in sickness and in health. The husband did not know that the child existed. Is it a surprise that sucks? Yeah but that\u2019s life and OP either needs to get a divorce or help raise the kid.", "This is neither sickness nor health. The husband is not sick and neither is the child.  if we\u2019re going to go that route, then a spouse should also tolerate infidelity, since that would fall under the \u201cfor better or for worse\u201c part of the vows."]}
