It can be a sign of racism, but it's not automatic.  You probably just should have lied and said you won't date co-workers, or something like that.

She could have / should have let it drop that you did not want to date her. But why, oh why, would you say what you did? WTF were you thinking? All you had to say is, \" you're just not my type\" and leave it at that.

She should have let it go but OMG yes YTA and a fucking racist.", "Technically NTA, but I think that might have come out wrong, dude. I would say just tell her you aren't her type or simply that you aren't attracted to her. However, she sounds EXTREMELY persistent, and would have absolutely demanded why, so, as chicken as this sounds, I would have probably just made something up. People have dating preferences, and you cannot help if you aren't attracted to her, or to anyone, for whatever reason. If it's not there, it's not there. And honestly, I personally think she is in the wrong because she resorted to outright harassing you. You owe absolutely nobody a relationship, for any reason. You didn't even owe her an explanation. That sounds like it was a hard situation to be in, no matter how you tried to handle it", "NTA - But you done fucked up.  The appropriate answer would be that I'm not attracted to you, and please stop harassing me about it.\n\nWe're in a time where you can have a dating preference with race, but if you vocalize it against certain races, you are going to get cancelled.\n\nYou needed to take initiative on this at work and tell HR exactly what happened.  If you are in a 1 party consent state, I'd record your meetings with HR, and maybe even your interaction with this person or coworkers that are messing with you.\n\nI'd personally be looking for another job.", "Oh shit. You were NOT until I got to the end. It's totally fine to not be attracted to someone. And it is odd that she kept pushing it after you said no. \n\nBut jeez, to simply say you're not attracted to an entire skin tone? (sorry if that's not the right phrasing!) Perhaps you've not yet met a black girl that you're into, fair enough, we can't help who we have and haven't met. That's just really not a nice thing to say \ud83d\ude1e it's sad that you're so closed minded \n\nYTA", "Y T A. At best, you have an unconscious bias, which is still typically derived from systemic racism. At worst, you\u2019re actively racist (which doesn\u2019t appear to be true, but I don\u2019t know you so who knows).\n\nIn any case, that was absolutely an asshole thing to say. When you reject someone for something outside of their control, it is an asshole move. Add to it the racial insensitivity behind this comment, and you should start looking for a new job, potentially in a new field cause shit like this sticks.\n\nEdit: upon comment and rereading, the fact that she keeps asking about this would definitely be harassment so ESH.

Racist because of a preference? I don\u2019t think so.", "Agree that he shouldn\u2019t have brought race into the conversation.

Really helpful.", "Keep saying that and click your heels three times, see if that works.", "Yes it's brilliantly diverse here, to the point it's almost unnoticeable :) Sorry for calling you closed minded, the added context does help. Not sure if much can be done to fix this, but wishing you luck in your dating!", "This is a good idea. OP, definitely write out your thoughts, so you don't lose track of them during the meeting. I am the type where I would forget everything I wanted to say, and writing everything out really helps.", "I agree I could be better at this.", "Not a worry, I can see how a close minded person would be likely to get themselves into a similar situation.
