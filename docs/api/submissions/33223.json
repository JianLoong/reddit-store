I am 20 weeks pregnant with bad nausea, right before we left I felt I needed to throw up. Because I know how important it is to my husband that we attend mass and we did not go last week, I decided to rally and go. We had to leave in about 3 minutes so I put on my clothes and ate some crackers so I would feel a bit better.\n\nI told my husband I was not feeling well, I just nearly threw up, but I am going to attend still. He said callously \"are you wearing tights?\" I said \"they're leggings.\" He responded in a judgy tone \"you can't wear leggings to church.\" I said \"well, these are the only pants that fit me now so either I wear these or I am not going at all. Plus, I see people wearing leggings all the time there.\" He sighed and said \"okay..\" passive aggressively, which irritated me. So I said \"Perhaps you should be focusing on the fact that I'm sick and nearly just threw up rather than what I am wearing.\" He responded rudely, \"you are always sick.\" That angered me as I felt it was dismissive and uncaring. \n\nHe seemed very moody in the car so I tried to bring up the argument to resolve it, but he told me to leave him alone so I did, but eventually I told him I did not want to sit next to him in church feeling upset and wanted to make amends before we went inside. He again told me to leave him alone and move on. \n\nI sat in church next to him very upset. There is a moment where the priest says we should offer people a sign of peace, and typically my husband hugs me in that moment. Today, he hugged me and I did not hug him back because I was feeling very hurt by him. After mass, we got back in the car and I told him he owed me an apology for his behavior this morning. He gave me a genuinely nice apology. But then, he said \"you really upset me by not giving me a hug in church this morning and you should apologize to me for that.\" I thought that was absurd, so I told him that I did not want to give him a hug because of how mean he was to me this morning and I was feeling hurt. He would not accept this answer and when we got home it turned into another argument.\n\nI wanted to resolve this issue and have a nice day together, and told him this. I said that he cannot expect a hug from someone when he was mean to them before, and that I had tried to make amends in the car but he refused to. He said that me not wanting to give him a hug was ridiculous and me not hugging him was embarrassing. I said that he has to understand his behavior has consequences. He told me the only way he was going to move on from this is if I apologize to him for not giving him a hug, and I told him  I was not willing to apologize to him for something I did not feel like was wrong.\n\nHe got really angry from that point on, stormed out, took my car and left to go to his mom's house.

It's likely more about control and appearances. He's more concerned about how things look to others (you wearing leggings to church) than your well-being (being pregnant and nauseous). His reaction screams of someone who values external perceptions over genuine support for his partner.\n\nYour husband's refusal to discuss the issue in the car and his expectation of normalcy in church (like expecting a hug) paint a picture of someone who's not just avoiding conflict but is possibly manipulative. He wants to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of a happy, normal couple in public, regardless of the reality.\n\nThe apology feels more like a strategic move than genuine remorse. It\u2019s like he\u2019s ticking off a box: \"Apologize, then demand an apology for a trivial matter to shift the blame.\" His reaction to not getting a hug seems disproportionately dramatic, almost like he's using it as a weapon to make you feel guilty.\n\nThis is manipulative and controlling. He's punishing you by storming out and taking your car, a clear power play. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s saying, \"If I don\u2019t get what I want, I\u2019ll create inconvenience and emotional distress for you.\"\n\nYou standing your ground in not hugging him in church was a small act of rebellion against his unreasonable expectations and manipulative behavior. Refusing to apologize for it is you asserting that you won\u2019t play into his narrative where he\u2019s always the victim.\n\nYour husband seems more interested in maintaining appearances and exercising control than in addressing the real issues in your relationship. Your reaction, while it might seem stubborn to some, could be seen as a necessary stand against emotional manipulation.\n\nThis isn't just a simple marital spat; it\u2019s a red flag for deeper issues in the relationship, possibly rooted in control and manipulation.\n\nSuggestion? Beyond couples therapy, which might help, keep an eye out for these patterns. If they're consistent, it might be time to question the health of the relationship overall. Control and manipulation can escalate, and it's crucial to protect yourself, especially with a baby on the way.", "Oh boy. Yet another sad tale of a woman with two children, one of which is her husband.  \n\n\nNTA.  \n\n\nLeave him?

What\u2019s he gonna be like once there\u2019s a baby?", "NTA - you gave your husband a chance to reconcile before church and he continued to be rude, so why would you suddenly want to pretend everything was okay by giving him a hug? It was just for show\u2026 how hypocritical and childish of him.\n\nBetter make sure he understands he doesn\u2019t get an emotional support parent for the delivery\u2026 and maybe consider hiring a doula to make sure your needs are met because he seems more interested in himself right now.", "So, your husband is a controlling AH and you\u2019re focusing on the hug?

Why should you return a hug when he's been obnoxious all morning? \n\nMost of all, why does he take \\*your\\* car when he goes storming off? Did he leave you without transport? Will he do the same again if he gets annoyed with you when you're 38 weeks pregnant?", "Honey, a good husband wouldn\u2019t find attending Church more important than the well being of the woman he loves and the mother of his unborn child. The fact that you\u2019re \u201calways sick\u201d, should make him MORE sympathetic not LESS. It honestly sound like you have much bigger problems than an argument about hugging. He sounds really selfish and uncaring.", "NTA. \n\nBut you did marry one of those Christian men who is the head of the household and makes the decisions. This is your life. I'm really sorry. When the baby comes it's going to be 10 times worse. You gave up your autonomy to a bad leader. And I say this as the daughter of a Christian pastor. Who would put his wife's comfort before going to church, because he understands that going to church is a performative thing, and taking care of your family is the Christ-like thing to do.\n\nYour husband cares more about performance than he does about your well-being, and that directly contradicts the Bible. He is a bad Christian and a bad leader and a bad head of the household. He is doing a disservice to you, to your baby, and to his faith.", "NTA but you definitely married one. \n\nHe sounds controlling and insufferable. It may be better for him to stay with his mom until she can teach him better. Clearly he missed important lessons growing up, and it's time to retrain him, or rehome him.", "NTA. There are consequences for actions... he was hurtful that morning so you didn't hug him back. He should have taken it as a message, not as a reason to continue an argument.\n\nWhen I was pregnant, I learned where every bathroom in every store was located and threw up in them all. I often would tumble out of the car and vomit in the front yard of my home bc I couldn't make it into my house to throw up in privacy. For me this lasted 7 1/2 months.\n\nYour husband is ridiculous for taking your \"morning sickness\" as some sort of insult towards him. That is just crazy!  I started picking out what to eat based on what it tasted like when I threw it up later... sounds gross, but the whole situation was gross. Baby turned out super happy and healthy - so totally worth it.", "It's making me feel ill reading this post. Your husband may attend church, but his behavior isn't very Christian.", "NTA. I think there are some significant issues going unaddressed here. He seems to be resentful of you being ill while pregnant as though you're not a team and he didn't have a part in putting you in your current condition. He also seems to be petty and holding grudges when things don't go exactly his way. He seems to expect you to just \"get over\" your hurts and upset, but he's allowed to hold onto perceived slights indefinitely until you properly defer to him and show penance. These are things that would give me serious pause. I'd really reconsider whether this is the kind of relationship you want to raise a kid in. I hope you have a good support system.", "Nta  your body autonomy is yours", "ESH. Please go get some marriage counseling (from a real therapist, not a priest) before you bring a child into this emotionally immature mess.", "WTF  The AH took a sick pregnant person's car?  That says it all.", "NTA. OP, I hope you have a good relationship with your family, because right now is time to go home to them.

Cut your losses and run.", "I know this isn\u2019t what the post is about but I\u2019m sitting here thinking about how there\u2019s people that still go to church regularly LOL", "attending was important for him. Do you think you have free will? Can you decide to not go? will he punish you if you don't? Will he use silent treatment?\n\nIs he a good husband? From what you've written, he doesn't seem to particularly care about your health or the pregnancy. I think you need to talk to a therapist as well as to your support system (friends and family) .\n\nWill this man support you through the rest of pregnancy and child birth? /will he help with childcare and help you during recovery? Do you feel respected and supported generally? \n\nA lot of men tend to show their true sides when their partner becomes pregnant because they think they're trapped them with a baby and they can't leave.

But you caught me with not having anything else to wear (do you have maternity things?) and I definitely don\u2019t think you have to apologize for not extending peace directly to him. He does NOT get to decide what you wear. I think you need to leave and go to your parents or a friend\u2019s house asap. Tell someone to pick you up and pack a couple bags of essentials. Your husband is an abuser with anger management issues. Get some counseling asap. You made a huge mistake marrying him & I have no idea how you got to this stage because I can\u2019t believe there weren\u2019t warning signs. He needs to get in therapy now as well so he can figure out if he can get control of himself, but it\u2019s not your job to get him in therapy.

There is not a single store nearby me that sells maternity clothes. Up until 1.5 weeks ago, I was able to wear all of my normal clothes. My belly \"popped\" in the last 1.5 weeks, so nothing fits except for leggings now. So I ordered a bunch of maternity clothes online, because, as I said there are no stores nearby.

He did not decide to do that so clearly it was not that big of a deal in the end that I was wearing leggings.\n\nFurthermore, this church is extremely casual.
