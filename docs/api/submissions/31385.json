It isn't your father's wife's fault, and sounds like it isn't your mother's fault.  Your father was the cheater who put everyone else in a bad situation.  In this situation, your mother sounds the most grounded and responsible.  She does seem to have a good heart on her shoulders, I'm glad you had that support system.  \n\nI am glad for you that you enjoy your father and want that relationship with him.  His wife did not leave him when he had an affair and held resentment at the reminder of said affair.  Again, that is his fault, not yours.  But through that, he keeps seeing you and thus, she is in your life at least to some degree.  \n\nHer change in attitude since she can't have children herself is  somewhat surprising.  She could just get more resentful and be a bigger problem between you and your father.  You are a lady who isn't fully mature, she is a grown adult who should be.  She has treated you poorly for years even though this situation isn't your fault, she can suck up some of your attitude back.\n\nThat being said, she does live with your father full time and unless he is going to leave her, she still has his ear more than anyone else does.  Ultimately this will be a question of importance to you.  She may be a great woman who was put in a tough situation as it sounds like your mother must be.  You decide if you want to give her any chances to show that to you.  It does sound to me like it could be valid that she wants an important piece of her husband's life to be there for him.  \n\nMost importantly.  None of this is your fault!  You presented what read as a very fair representation of the situation.  That can be difficult when you are an involved party and have been wronged.  You don't have to let this woman into your life now, or later.  But it may well be easier and more pleasant if you did.  Only you can decide if and when to do so, and if she is still crossing boundaries.  Either way, this situation was not your fault and continues to be \"not your fault\".  Remember that for the rest of your life.", "YTA. I am at a loss to understand what she has done to you that was voluntary. Frankly I think she is the only innocent party. I agree with your father", "NTA.  Your father and his wife put you in an impossible situation. \n\nIf his wife has an epiphany and realized that she should not have spent decades blaming you for her husband's infidelity, then she really should have told you about this change of heart, and then offered you baby steps toward a relationship, and only if you were both ready.  \n\nThis, though, is all kinds of messed up.  She can't have a child, and now she realizes you are the closest thing to a daughter she will ever have ... And she is projecting her desires onto you.  \n\nThat ain't healthy for her or for you.  Best you steer clear.", "NTA.  When she learned of her husband's affair she had two choices: leave or stay and treat the baby (you) with common human decency.  She chose option 3: make the innocent baby the scapegoat.  Stay away from her especially while she's dealing with her infertility.  Your plan of only seeing your dad away from her is a good one.", "Why not?

If she had such a problem with the cheating she should have divorced her husband instead of trying to ruin a child\u2019s life.\n\nEDIT: this woman has also abused the OP both verbally and physically as per the recent comments. She is no saint. Definitely not good enough for Reddit to emotionally manipulate a 15 year old into being the \u201cbigger\u201d person like the controversial section is trying their best to do.", "I love how this sub is emotionally manipulating a 15 year old into \u201ctrying to be a bigger person\u201d and warming up to a woman who has proven she can discard the kid in a moment\u2019s notice. \n\nShe literally tried to ruin a child\u2019s life and made the child the embodiment of cheating rather than the husband who actually cheated. She should have divorced the husband instead of making sure a child became fatherless.", "I understand your point but you ever had a 15 y/o daughter? Cause it gets wild sometimes.

I was frigging 7 I thought my mom was dying and I couldn\u2019t be there to see her and I was going to have to live with this crazy woman that wants to throw me out in the yard.

She may be right, my be wrong.", "She's an asshole, but so is your Dad. \n\nIf he wanted to spend more time with you, he would have. That's on him, not her. He had an affair. Had a child.

Absolutely not a good reason to treat a child this way, she needs therapy. \n\nNow, you seems to put all the blame on her...but the only true culprit is your dad no? Why did he let her sabotage your relationship? He is a grown man and should be able to put his foot down and have some boundaries. In the end, HE was the one making the final decision. HE is your father, therefore the only person that you should held accountable for his actions. You can definitely hate his wife, but in the end your father is the only one responsable.", "No. \n\nYour stepmom isnt either. It wasnt her fault for you being separated from your father. It was his fault knowing he was married to someone else and decided to go on vacation from marriage with your mom. \n\nIts a sad turn out. But just know you and her are the accidental victims.

But what you said was extremely harsh. This is NOT an excuse for her behavior, she\u2019s definitely the bigger AH in this situation. But this situation has been hard for her, knowing her husband cheated and betrayed her and the vows he made to her. Infertility is really heartbreaking for a lot of people. What you said to her is she essentially did something to cause/deserve being infertile and being cheated on. That\u2019s out of line. She needs therapy to deal with her stuff, she should not be taking anything out on you. But all of this is essentially on your dad. He lied to 2 women, he caused a pregnancy outside of his marriage, and HE chooses to not be more involved in your life.

You are totally innocent in this- your father made mistakes in order for you to come into being, but once you did, you became your own entity. Dad's wife was wrong to ever take it out on you or make you feel like you somehow deserved her rage no matter WHAT she was feeling about her disloyal husband. She was an adult, and you are a child.

There is no excuse in the universe for an adult taking out their anger about an unrelated situation on a child. \n\nYour father sounds like he's trying to make everyone happy, but that just isn't always possible.

That's wrong, and it does make him the AH as far as I am concerned. He doesn't have to have been mean to you himself for him to have enabled her unacceptable behavior. \n\nYou are NTA of course, but your father and his wife absolutely are. If she didn't want her infertility brought up she didn't need to bring it up herself. By bringing it up she was trying to manipulate you into feeling bad for her and forgiving her for 15 years of unacceptable behavior and now she's angry that you didn't buy it- and good for you. Your father shouldn't have so much as allowed her to be in the room with you, if all she wanted was to manipulate you and pretend nothing was wrong after everything she's done.", "NTA.

The kindest thing to do for yourself and your dad's wife is to avoid her. What you said was harsh, and in other circumstances, it could even be considered cruel, but it was also entirely predictable. You're fifteen and she tried to corner you into committing to a relationship that she's deliberately undermined at every turn for your entire life.   \nOne thing I will note is to be careful cutting your dad too much slack in this situation. He was the person with the most knowledge and context going into that lunch, but he still let his wife blindside you. He's shown himself to be the kind of person who is going to do whatever keeps his life most comfortable, which means this might not be the last overture he facilitates.", "NTA, Your dad\u2019s wife definitely tried to play you, The fact your father let her even do that after knowing how she treated you for years says a lot and he didn\u2019t even make her apologize before he let her ask you to be back up kid.\n\nAsk her how would she feel if she could have kids ?

Probably not.\n\nDon\u2019t be a back up child.", "Yea you show them treat the other person that was treated like garbage and not the dad who caused it all.

I\u2019ll be mean too. \n\nIn a few years you\u2019ll understand that women who are infertile did not do anything to cause it. It\u2019s not the result of her mistreating you.

Fun thing about life, you are situationally right to feel the way you do. 100% none of that makes you an AH. But saying that absolutely does. I get you are hurt and a kid, so you get some leeway while you learn to vocalize your feelings in an okay way. But it was still not okay to do.\n\nOn the other hand, that lady is delusional to think any person would be chill with her after everything. And to legit ask to be your step mom, gross.

She made what seemed like sincere effort but then as we all age just gradually regressed when I didn't immediately want to consider her a parent. Slightly distant became adversarial after my Dad got cancer. Escalated pretty nastily in some weird ways because she was a weird lady... But that's another story. Long story short I tried a final time to mend things with her. My Dad died a few days later. She hasn't been a part of my life, my wife's, or my daughter's. People don't always act loving when they don't get the love they think they deserve.\n\nAll that said, what you said came out of a place of hurt and anger, and was undoubtedly harsh in that moment. I dunno that she deserved that, that's for you to know, but if you feel bad about it that's a feeling to address too and you may want to act depending on how you truly feel about that. It sounds like you knew this would devastate her. It's not weak to say \"I'm sorry\" if that's what you feel.

They\u2019ll give them so many chances & accept the bare minimum from their parents.\nSo if a bio dad was kind enough to OP, but only hurt other ppl w/o OP knowing or is good at shifting blame so they look like a victim/innocent, it\u2019s not surprising to see someone absolve them & love them.\nFor example, dad could literally blame the wife for not seeing OP to OP\u2019s face, & then tell the wife another story entirely to placate her. How would OP know?\n\nShe\u2019s still a kid and has a decade left before her brain fully matures. And abuse especially changes the biology of the brain. Also, her mom did nothing wrong. She\u2019s apparently a good mom, w/ a good fianc\u00e9, & didn\u2019t know bio dad was married.", "Honestly it\u2019s a really common theme on the different cheating subs", "100% on him ONLY IF:\n\nmom did not know or had no reason to know. ie, no wedding band, obvious signs he\u2019s married, etc.\n\nif she knew or should\u2019ve known he was married she is partly to blame \n\nless than 50% worst case tho even if she knew\n\nedit: but in this story she did not know so this is a moot point, just wanted to clarify the line here", "There\u2019s nothing complex about cruelty towards an innocent child.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty damn straight forward, actually.", "Cruel? Once may have sent a child to her room maybe because she couldn\u2019t look at her\u2026 maybe. Even if she did she didn\u2019t harm her or abuse her ffs.", "\u201cCruelty\u201d"]}
