My mom didn\u2019t know he was married and broke it off when she found out but she was already pregnant. She decided to have me and has always been a great mom to me. A lot of my friends don\u2019t get along with their moms but mine is really cool and I wouldn\u2019t trade her for anyone. My dad takes me out on the weekends to do things and visits on holidays, but I\u2019ve never lived with him or anything. When I was younger he had to take me to his house for a few hours one time when my mom was really sick and his wife yelled at him and I had to stay in a bedroom away from her because she was so mad. My mom explained the cheating when I was older and realized how weird the situation was compared to friends with divorced parents. I have feels about it, but he\u2019s my dad so I try to not think about it a lot. I know my dad\u2019s wife hates me and is the reason I can\u2019t see him more, so yeah, she has a reason to be mad at him, but also screw her.\n\nSo a couple of months ago, my dad started asking if I would like to spend whole weekends with him. I said I would be ok with it if it wasn\u2019t at his house. He said his wife wants me to come and she\u2019s had a change of heart. Sounded really sus so I said no. Then this weekend she wanted to come have lunch with my dad and me. She said that she realized how important I am to my dad since they can\u2019t have kids now and that she would like to make up for it all and be my step-mom if I would let her.\n\nIt really made me mad because my whole life she\u2019s made it really hard to see my dad and now she wants to be nice? I might be TA because I told her that if she can\u2019t have kids that\u2019s karma for how she treated me and she\u2019s never going to be anything but my dad\u2019s wife. She started crying and my dad told me later that was a terrible thing and I need to apologize. My mom said that she put me in an unfair situation and I should probably avoid talking to her right now because she\u2019s having to deal with infertility and hasn\u2019t really gotten over things.\n\nAITA?

Just know this: None of the weirdness you have been feeling around not being able to see your dad at his house while you were growing up is your fault. Not one little bit! You are probably right that your dad's wife wants contact with you now only because she is infertile. But it would be nice if you could remember that the weirdness wasn't really her fault either. The arrow points to your father! If you were to give her a chance some time in the future when things have quietened down, you might find that she's not such a bad egg. If she could become an adult to count on, that wouldn't be a bad outcome of the whole debacle, since you can never have too many people you can count on.

All of her past shitty behavior toward you is coming back to haunt her. \n\nThe question for you is, do you want to set fire to this bridge? It'd be easy to do, but she's a part of your dad's life and will likely continue to be. If you want to spend more time with him, it will be with her at his side. She has realized - perhaps way too late - the value of having a relationship with you, and has made a tentative effort reach out to you to make peace.\n\nAs your dad's wife, she is a person you'd probably benefit from having a good relationship with.

It isn't your father's wife's fault, and sounds like it isn't your mother's fault.  Your father was the cheater who put everyone else in a bad situation.  In this situation, your mother sounds the most grounded and responsible.  She does seem to have a good heart on her shoulders, I'm glad you had that support system.  \n\nI am glad for you that you enjoy your father and want that relationship with him.  His wife did not leave him when he had an affair and held resentment at the reminder of said affair.  Again, that is his fault, not yours.  But through that, he keeps seeing you and thus, she is in your life at least to some degree.  \n\nHer change in attitude since she can't have children herself is  somewhat surprising.  She could just get more resentful and be a bigger problem between you and your father.  You are a lady who isn't fully mature, she is a grown adult who should be.  She has treated you poorly for years even though this situation isn't your fault, she can suck up some of your attitude back.\n\nThat being said, she does live with your father full time and unless he is going to leave her, she still has his ear more than anyone else does.  Ultimately this will be a question of importance to you.  She may be a great woman who was put in a tough situation as it sounds like your mother must be.  You decide if you want to give her any chances to show that to you.  It does sound to me like it could be valid that she wants an important piece of her husband's life to be there for him.  \n\nMost importantly.  None of this is your fault!  You presented what read as a very fair representation of the situation.  That can be difficult when you are an involved party and have been wronged.  You don't have to let this woman into your life now, or later.  But it may well be easier and more pleasant if you did.  Only you can decide if and when to do so, and if she is still crossing boundaries.  Either way, this situation was not your fault and continues to be \"not your fault\".  Remember that for the rest of your life.", "YTA. I am at a loss to understand what she has done to you that was voluntary. Frankly I think she is the only innocent party. I agree with your father", "NTA.  Your father and his wife put you in an impossible situation. \n\nIf his wife has an epiphany and realized that she should not have spent decades blaming you for her husband's infidelity, then she really should have told you about this change of heart, and then offered you baby steps toward a relationship, and only if you were both ready.  \n\nThis, though, is all kinds of messed up.  She can't have a child, and now she realizes you are the closest thing to a daughter she will ever have ... And she is projecting her desires onto you.  \n\nThat ain't healthy for her or for you.  Best you steer clear.", "NTA.  When she learned of her husband's affair she had two choices: leave or stay and treat the baby (you) with common human decency.  She chose option 3: make the innocent baby the scapegoat.  Stay away from her especially while she's dealing with her infertility.  Your plan of only seeing your dad away from her is a good one.", "Why not? Doesn\u2019t mean OP has to forgive her but nothing wrong realizing your mistakes and trying to do better.", "> If she could become an adult to count on, that wouldn't be a bad outcome of the whole debacle\n\nI love how the comments like yours are manipulating the OP into trying to depend on a woman who would rather make sure a child is fatherless and discarded than have a spine and divorce her cheating husband. If she had such a problem with the cheating she should have divorced her husband instead of trying to ruin a child\u2019s life.", "I love how this sub is emotionally manipulating a 15 year old into \u201ctrying to be a bigger person\u201d and warming up to a woman who has proven she can discard the kid in a moment\u2019s notice. \n\nShe literally tried to ruin a child\u2019s life and made the child the embodiment of cheating rather than the husband who actually cheated. She should have divorced the husband instead of making sure a child became fatherless.", "I understand your point but you ever had a 15 y/o daughter? Cause it gets wild sometimes.  Add to that the chaos she was brought into. Just like her step mom, she\u2019ll learn things as she moves through life and probably cringe at her comments at some point in life. I\u2019ll lean NTA.", "When my mom was really sick and had emergency surgery and my dad was the only one who could come get me from school until my grandparents could get there, she yelled at me and told me to get out and then shut me up in a room alone while she yelled at my dad and stomped around until my grandpa came. I was frigging 7 I thought my mom was dying and I couldn\u2019t be there to see her and I was going to have to live with this crazy woman that wants to throw me out in the yard.  Every time my dad spends more than a couple hours with me she spams his phone until he picks up and calls to yell at him until he leaves. Even on my birthdays. I hate her.", "She isn\u2019t realizing her mistake and doing better tho, she would\u2019ve no doubt continued to behave the same way if she could\u2019ve had children herself. She sees OP as a last resort to \u00abhave a kid\u00bb for her own selfish reasons.", "Very few mistakes can top \u201cmaking sure a child sees their father as little as possible because you\u2019re too spineless to leave the actual cheater and focus all your hatred on a kid\u201d.", "That\u2019s OP\u2019s perspective sure. And how she wrote this. She may be right, my be wrong."]}
