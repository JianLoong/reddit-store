I had never had my own room growing up and share a room with a roommate in my current living situation to save up money. I always felt the need to share and felt guilty when I wanted to be alone in my room but couldn't since someone else was there. The only time I had a room all to myself was when my roommate or sibling was away. Even so, I didn't feel like I truly had a room to myself.\n\nWhen discussing the use for one of the spare rooms in our soon to be house, I mentioned wanting to turn it into a bedroom for myself when I want to be alone. My fianc\u00e9 was confused and said he wanted to use the spare room for an at home gym instead. The other spare room will be an office for when my fianc\u00e9 needs to work from home. I argued that he already has a claim over one of the spare rooms and I should be allowed to use the other one for myself. I told him that I was looking forward to having a space all to myself, where I can be alone when I want, and am the only person that has access to. He argued that the point of moving in together was to share everything with each other and not just coexist in the same space.\n\nHe said he would change his mind on wanting a gym if we agreed to turn the second room into a guest bedroom that both of us can use when we want to be in our own space. I feel like I would still be sharing. If I have a room to myself to use and he wants to be alone at times, I can just go into my own room, and give him the space he wants. We would be splitting expenses 50/50 so I don't think I am being that unreasonable.

Wow, he says that you should share everything with each other then he commandeers the extra 2 bedrooms for himself? What a jerk. You are an equal partner and if he uses one as an office, you should be able to get the other as a bedroom, craft room, or whatever else you want to do with it.

This is actually a thing. Not all couples require all space to be  shared space, if an individual has a need for periods of solitude that needs to be addressed.

Your fianc\u00e9 is not making fair compromises, and as others have pointed out, it is not reasonable for his starting point to be that he gets both the other rooms (\"his office\" and \"his gym\"). It would be reasonable, as others have suggested, for you each to have an office. The criticism that I alluded to is, it is very strange that you want your special room to be such that *only you* have access to it \u2014 this would mean, a room that has a key which only you have, or a door that is forbidden to be even opened by someone other than you \u2014 this is distinct, of course, from a scenario in which it is understood that this is your space and it shouldn't be used by other people. The former is a bizarre scenario for a married or engaged couple, but it sounds like there may be some experiences in your life that are leading you to want this; you and your fianc\u00e9 should get to the bottom of this intentionally, so that you can come to a solution that meets your needs (and his). It might be that your post's wording didn't convey exactly what you meant, and in this case, I'd go for an unconditional NTA.\n\nI would say that contrary to some of the other messages, and to your allusion, the expense split (50/50) is quite irrelevant to the current discussion. This would be pertinent to housemates or people in a non-engaged relationship, but at your stage, what determines how the space is divided **must not** be how much money each person is spending on (e.g.) the mortgage or rent, but rather the shared desire of two committed partners to meet each other's needs. If you stopped working, would you suddenly be OK with giving up all say in how your home-life is organized? If your fianc\u00e9 stopped working, should he be ok with that as well? It is good to find a way to break out of that transactional mindset, and move into the mutual problem-solving mindset.", "NTA.

If it was a \u201chome office\u201d, or \u201creading room\u201d or \u201clady cave\u201d or whatever you want to call it and was a room that you decorate however please and you can lounge and relax in when you want to do private things and your solo hang space then does that accomplish what you were looking for? If so, then explain it to him that way. If he has no issue anymore, then everybody else commenting here acting like he is just trying to bully you out of claiming one of the rooms is misunderstanding what\u2019s going on.", "YTA\n\nReddit has a propensity for completely equal divisions of everything and they'll die on that hill, even though that isn't how the world works\n\nHim having the office sounds like a work need, if it was a gaming room or something I'd be more sympathetic  but it's an office space, a one which presumably you will share if your work in the future ever necessitates it.\n\nIt's not a fun room. Your room is and that's unfair and seems odd. \n\nYour reasoning is fine, you want some of your own private space, sounds like it's based upon a lot of underlying mental health issues though which I hope you iron out before you grow your family and have kids, space is expensive. \n\nIf his office doubles as his gym/ gaming room and you get your private space, that would work and be okay.\n\nBecause under the way you want it, every space in the house is shared except these two rooms. His room is work focused and offers nothing to him except the March on for wages and you get a personal and private sanctuary. How is that fair?

What you want is entirely reasonable and would fall under a 50/50 split of \"he has his office, I get my own room.\" That said, the way you're phrasing it seems... odd. If I was in his shoes I would think it was an odd request because who needs their own bedroom to be alone when we already have a bedroom? \n\nWhat you're looking for is super common but most of the people I know don't call it \"my alone time room\" but more like a man-cave/Femme-den (or pretty sure its technically a boudoir, despite the lingerie modeling connotation it's adopted in the US), or personal office, or a study. If you were to call it any of those things I'm sure it would have gotten across a lot smoother. \n\nI'm also assuming he doesn't consider his office or gym space to be \"his\" space but more of a shared space that just so happens that he will almost solely use. So he probably just sees things as 3 shared rooms and no one gets their own space. So just keep pointing out to him that the office will be his man cave and he can stick the home gym in there and be alone and you get your own office space. \n\nThis goes with the caveat that he's acting in good faith but misguided, and actually yields to the idea of you have a space since thats important to you and he needs to readjust his mindset.

Your husbands need for a second room comes from having to have a space to work from. That almost shouldn\u2019t even count as a room to choose from it already has a necessary purpose going in. 1 room left over. Should you have more of a say with what happens with it? Of course. But should it be all yours with no access to your husband? I can see why he would be a little upset. Can\u2019t you?", "NTA\n\nI think the problem with your suggestion is that you want to have two bedrooms. One for you+fianc\u00e9. One for just you. \n\nThat\u2026. Sounds like a massive waste of space. \n\nBut wanting one of the two rooms to be your space is fair. \n\nIs his office a room you will be using? Or is it exclusively for him? I know at least the primary use is for him to work in, but does it have a secondary use?\n\nSo my bf and I also have a 3 bedroom house for ourselves. We do indeed have the two extra rooms as one room for each of us.\n\nHis room? Is also our guest room. We have the extra bed in there. Also the dog\u2019s kennel. But he has his hobby/collection stored in this room and it will be decorated with the stuff is his that doesn\u2019t really fit into \u201cour\u201d space. \n\nMy room? Is a library/office. It holds his fiction books along with all of mine. Also a kitty litter box. \n\nOut of those two rooms - mine is more exclusively mine, and from a glance can seem slightly unbalanced. But - my partner also has an entire garage for his use. So if we look at square footage he has significantly more space in the house than I do. \n\nBut he is also the person who generates a shitton of mess that drives me insane. So having my room be one that he\u2019s basically banned from ensures I have somewhere that I always will be comfortable in. If I go into a room and use it, he would never know because I never leave any mess behind. He seems incapable of doing so and it\u2019s by far the biggest issue in our relationship. \n\nSo\u2026 it\u2019s ok to make space dual-purpose. But things need to be fair for you. If you will also have a computer/desk space in the home office then it makes sense for the other room to also have a secondary use. \n\nI\u2019d suggest making your room a guest room. Not for your bf. But for if you genuinely invited guests over to stay. The room can be decorated by you and primarily used by you, make it into your hobby room if you have any hobbies, but having a spare bed in there for when you do have guests could help maximize the space. \n\nAs it is with your bf right now? He\u2019s an asshole. How the fuck he thought \u201cok so this second room is my office and this third room is my gym\u201d\u2026. How he managed to honestly think that was a fair distribution of the home is beyond me. He can make ONE room into a home office/gym. But that means you get to make the second room into what you will want to use.

I get that it's something you've dealt with your whole life, but isn't the spare bedroom idea kind of fair? Neither of you would be there as full time as your actual shared bedroom \\[and if you are maybe rethink the relationship?\\] - so it would be a shared space but not in the same way that your bedroom would be.

I would not pay 50% of rent/mortgage for the house where I\u2019m not allowed to use 30% of space. Are you also not allowed in the office?", "YTA. Presumably the office is something that you can use as well. An office, like a gym, is something that can be shared.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think you are ready to move in. \n\nMaybe live by yourself for a while.", "NTA. However this may be an unpopular opinion. But, I think you should reconsider getting married. You\u2019ll never be alone and you\u2019ll never have a space that\u2019s your own. And, also why does he get to have both spare rooms while you only share the bedroom?", "I can\u2019t decide between N T A and N A H. \n\nAnd I say that as someone who has had a separate bedroom since I moved in with my partner - AND we both have separate \u201coffices\u201d since his kids moved out. \n\nIt\u2019s very normal for people to expect to share a bedroom with their partner, so it\u2019s ok that he might be a bit weirded out by your preference *initially*. \n\nAnd that might come out indirectly, like suggesting the guest room is also shared. \n\nSo let him have some time to absorb your suggestion - so long as he is doing the work to consider it. \n\nAnd\u2026 his assumption that he gets both spare rooms for his personal use is insanely selfish, but again it might just be careless. He might just be excited for what he\u2019d like & (temporarily) forgot he\u2019s sharing the space. \n\nSo a lot of this will come down to what his underlying character is like, on a day to day basis. \n\nIs he a genuinely kind & loving man, who will put himself out regularly to make sure your needs are being met. \n\nFor example: I wake up later than my partner - he was already at work (from home) today when I woke. He heard me wake & made me a fresh pot of tea (sooo lovely & kind) & texted me that it was done. So very sweet. But I texted back that I want awake enough to come down yet - so he brought it upstairs to me. Outrageously kind of him. And it\u2019s not that I\u2019m some pampered princess - we are both kind to each other. \n\nINFO - My question is - do you have many stories of him inconveniencing himself in small & medium ways (ie not just occasional grand gestures) on a regular basis for you. \n\nWe have separate bedrooms & actually sleep apart most nights (early bird & night owl). But to start with it was more about day time space. \n\nWe both need downtime on our own occasionally - so initially 1 evening a week id leave him downstairs to watch TV and go read in my room. \n\nThat took him a while to get used to, but it\u2019s good for both of us so we do it more naturally now. \n\nIs this more about you having a space to yourself or specially having a separate bedroom? ie do you want to sleep apart from him?\n\nBecause otherwise why not set it up as your own \u201coffice\u201d - you both get a room for work & hobbies. That\u2019s how our offices are set up - all my craft mess & music stuff goes in there. And I have a comfy armchair. \n\nI\u2019ve got a friend who setup her office recently with a small desk and a \u201cday bed\u201d (a single bed that looks like a sofa) so she can \u201cwork from sofa\u201d if she prefers & they have a bed for guests.\n\nETA: also\u2026 my partner has his gym setup in the shed with a huge door. So in the summer he feels like he\u2019s doing a work out outdoors. That might be an option too\u2026?\n\nETA 2: there\u2019s a thing they say about framing (thing) as \u201cus against the problem\u201d rather than \u201cme against you\u201d which I think applies here. If you are buying a house together then I can promise this will not be the last time you both have different opinions on what to choose about something (we just put in a new kitchen last year and our design tastes are VERY different from each other - took a huge amount of effort but we designed something we both love eventually!). Figure out early on how you get both people\u2019s vision clear & then *jointly* go about finding a solution that gets most needs met for BOTH of you.", "It seems like it\u2019s more about being upset that you want to have space away from him. NTA", "I think you need to live by yourself if possible because that sounds like something you need. If you can't and have to move in with boyfriend, no, he doesn't get to commander two entire extra rooms and no, he does not get one extra room and joint custody of another extra room. That doesn't work either. NTA.\n\nYou turn the extra room into whatever and put a bed in there so you can have your space. He can put gym stuff in his office. It doesn't sound like he works from home full time anyway.", "Info: how big are the rooms? \nHow often do guests spend the night and if it's often, where will they sleep?\n\nNTA for wanting your own room, but if his office is closet sized for example and the room you'd like is bigger, I can understand talking about both your needs and figuring out a FAIR compromise.\n\nFor example my husband shares his gaming room/office with the 3 cats and their litter (they sleep there at night so he always has to put everything away in the evening). The freezer, washer and dryer are also in his room.  So my room is a bit smaller and we hang the laundry there.  He also puts some of his stuff in my room, so the cats and kids don't take it.\n\nEdit to say my room is nicer btw; high-low desk, cabinets for all my crafts, getting a cool book case next... While he gets the pleasure of having to vacume before he can work, and listening to the washer and dryer a few times a week lol. But this is a solution were both happy with,  as mine is next to our kids rooms while his is downstairs. So after their bedtime I can only do quiet crafts in my room or use the table downstairs, and he can play in his game room without waking the kids or driving me mad with the persistent clicking of his mouse.\n\nEdit 2: just read it again and even more firmly NTA. He doesn't need his office room every day to work and he still wants it to be his room. Then he can also store his shit there. Also air beds are a thing, so guests can just sleep on those in either of the spare rooms if guest spend the night, right?", "You\u2019re not unreasonable for wanting use of the second spare bedroom. \n\nHowever, demanding he not have access to the room is not acceptable. No one should be banned from spaces in their own home. \n\nAnd I can\u2019t blame him for being upset that you want to use it as a bedroom, and to sleep separately, even if it\u2019s only some nights.

I got one of the best rooms of the house as my space / office because I'll use it more often and I really need this room for myself. No children, no husband, no one enters. And we have a craft room in our basement. Mostly his, but ill use it if needed. \n\nI think in the end it is not the same space but we are both happy with it. And this is what counts.

Can you both co-own the office? Are you going to use the home gym? How often will you actually use your private bedroom? Do you just need a place to like read a book or something? Most of the rest of the world would find the concept of a private room to be an alien super luxury.\n\nYour BF is kinda wasteful with the home gym.  Home gyms are also kind of a waste if there is a commercial gym nearby or on the commute route.

But it doesn't sound like you're proposing a better use for the space. You could probably throw a fancy lawn chair, tv, and mood light in the gym if you needed a space to be alone.\n\n(EDIT: As an example of unequal but fair division, here is my wife and I. I get one room that is half office and half storage for camping and sporting equipment. My wife can use it whenever she wants but it's too crowded for her, so that's \"my\" space. Lol. My wife gets a whole wardrobe room, the closets in the guest bedroom, and studies in the mostly empty second floor/attic of our apartment.)\n\nI suspect your partner is unable to grasp how your private room is at all practical or provides utility to you or to him.

This should really be a question of whether or not you move in together right now. Are you planning on having kids? Which secondary bedroom will be repurposed as a nursery first? This could be an ongoing argument. You are only 24. There is no need to rush in to living with someone else or getting married. You've always had a roommate situation. Can you afford to get yourself a one bedroom or a studio apartment? Or have your roommate move out/ into a different room so the one you currently share is just yours? Your fiance probably doesn't want to view your home together as space that's mine and yours, but ours. He also probably doesn't have your lived experience of always having to share, so he can't relate to your need. There's a good chance he sees the office as work space and not personal space.

You get the my space alone experience and he gets to have a unified home, one where you both agree to what the space in spare bedrooms are used for and not his way or your way.

It seems to be an unfortunate combination of miscommunications and privacy concerns. I would like to mention that after living with a partner for a long period of time, it can be important to find time for yourself. Developing a secluded spot where you can just exist, without the constant pull of responsibilities and personal upkeep affecting your every move. It can be exhausting, I get it. \n\nHowever, I don't think your fianc\u00e9e's plan comes off as selfishly as some other commenters are implying. It doesn't seem like his primary motive for \"commandeering\" the two rooms has anything to do with segmenting the two of you or guaranteeing \"alone time\" for himself. It's for two very specific purposes: a space to work, I'm guessing which brings in at least half your income, and a space to work on physical improvement. Your choice to not engage in the physical space does not suddenly make it a selfish or immoral idea on his part, as everyone knows keeping good care of yourself is paramount and doing it at home is by far the most convenient solution.\n\nNow, you seem to bring up this concept of fairness when talking about this issue. I do not believe it's a fair comparison to block off an entire section of the house for a purpose which does not specifically require that room. Work, exercise, sleep, kitchens, bathrooms, they all require a specific setup in that room to function properly. But to just catch some alone time? Literally any room in the house, away from the other humans, is going to do the job just fine. You may prefer a specific spot, and that's ok, you can fluidly negotiate things like your schedule, usage of different parts of the house, visitors, interactions with your fianc\u00e9e, etc. Literally the world is yours to do as you wish, especially in your own home.\n\nThat being said, I think the desire to permanently and irrevocably section off a part of the home for only your personal use is extremely odd and somewhat uncomfortable. It makes me uncomfortable that your first decision in the partnership is to create boundaries, instead of being open to breaking them down. I would suggest you think on why you feel the need to ask for this.", "I\u2019m not sure how to rule on this because it isn\u2019t about alone time. If it were just about alone time either of you could shut yourself up in the bedroom and boom you\u2019re alone.

Anyway, if you\u2019re gonna push for this just be clear that what you want is to OWN the 3rd room, while he owns his office, and all other space is shared.

They are just not the loudest voice in the room at the moment!", "Tbh, if it\u2019s guy friends you live with in said void, they probably won\u2019t pay for decor. Thrift store it up and make yourself smile!!", "Yep..  it understandable to want the experience to have your own room but not when you are moving in with your fiancee. She should live independently first so she can experience it. Or at the very least. Have her own room with a roommate. She's now treating her fiancee like a roommate... it seems very immature and not like someone ready for marriage.", "Best marriage decision we ever made? Not sleeping in the same bed nightly. It\u2019s the best!!!", "I have my own bedroom for this reason. My boyfriend would rather me get enough sleep than demand I share a bed with him.", "I was worried my partner and I wouldn't be sleep compatible but in a king bed we both sleep really well. I do still need a body pillow between us because I need to have some kind of barrier to feel comfortable (autism thing).\n\nI don't get people who refuse to make their partner's life better!\n\nI hope your sleep situation has improved! And your MIL sounds like a treasure...", "People can love each other and still have areas of conflict.", "I love my flat pillows though", "Lol, yep.\n\nEarly on, my husband didn't have a preference until suddenly he did. It used to be like pulling teeth to get him to look at design styles or work with me to decide on a overarching color scheme for the home (coordinate paint colors, wood/carpet/rugs, etc), but occasionally he'd show up with something that was emotionally important and non-negotiable.\n\nLike a deer head he inherited from his father.\n\nSomehow he entered our marriage believing this was him being accomodating rather than pushing all the work of making the decisions onto me while occasionally throwing wrenches into the works.\n\nLuckily communication is a marvelous thing.  He's gotten much better about expressing interest, opinions, and giving me a heads up about things he hopes to someday add in.  He no longer believes he's *supposed* to not interfere with home decor unless it's something he just absolutely can't do without.\n\nI like our home a lot more when it's a blend of us and not just like my old student apartment aesthetic.", "Exactly and growing up our bedroom wasn\u2019t just a place to sleep. We often had a desk and bookcases and a tv and stereo, maybe even a game console or computer. It was all ours and it was a true multipurpose room just for us. You could lounge about with a good book or watch a movie or just get some much needed peace and quiet. \n\nThere is nothing saying either the office or the third bedroom couldn\u2019t double as a guest room when needed. Given her fianc\u00e9 wants to share the third bedroom and also use it as a guest bedroom though I have only one question\u2026 is he going to share his office with you? If the office is all his then I don\u2019t think asking you to share your bedroom/possibly also guest bedroom with him."]}
