I had never had my own room growing up and share a room with a roommate in my current living situation to save up money. I always felt the need to share and felt guilty when I wanted to be alone in my room but couldn't since someone else was there. The only time I had a room all to myself was when my roommate or sibling was away. Even so, I didn't feel like I truly had a room to myself.\n\nWhen discussing the use for one of the spare rooms in our soon to be house, I mentioned wanting to turn it into a bedroom for myself when I want to be alone. My fianc\u00e9 was confused and said he wanted to use the spare room for an at home gym instead. The other spare room will be an office for when my fianc\u00e9 needs to work from home. I argued that he already has a claim over one of the spare rooms and I should be allowed to use the other one for myself. I told him that I was looking forward to having a space all to myself, where I can be alone when I want, and am the only person that has access to. He argued that the point of moving in together was to share everything with each other and not just coexist in the same space.\n\nHe said he would change his mind on wanting a gym if we agreed to turn the second room into a guest bedroom that both of us can use when we want to be in our own space. I feel like I would still be sharing. If I have a room to myself to use and he wants to be alone at times, I can just go into my own room, and give him the space he wants. We would be splitting expenses 50/50 so I don't think I am being that unreasonable.

He gets to dictate what the rooms are for? And they're all for him? Oh hell no. Put your foot down. You're paying half the bills you get to make some decisions. He gets an office and wants a gym that won't be used? Nope. Tell him put his gym equipment in the office.", "NTA. I\u2019m a huge advocate that even couples need their own space to be in sometimes. It\u2019s very codependent to share everything all the time.", "NTA \n\nIf you split everything 50/50 then you should both get 1 bedroom for personal use, if he wants claim to both extra rooms he will have to pay 75% of the rent and expenses. \n\nStand your grown", "NTA\n\nYou have one room together and he has the other room - could make it into a gym/office. The other room should be yours. Equal split.\n\nHowever I think it might have been the way you phrased what you wanted to do with the room that has thrown him off. You\u2019ve said you want a separate bedroom from him where you can be alone. I think he\u2019s panicked thinking you will be in there all the time.", "Wait! Is everyone missing the point? She has an issue sharing a room with a man she has agreed to share her life with.", "Exactly, your office!", "\u201cWhat\u2019s mine is mine, what\u2019s yours is also mine\u201d\n\nThis was my exact thought. He sounds like a controlling person who only prioritizes his own wants and needs. \u2639\ufe0f", "I think some of this does depend on how fully the office room is actually just a workspace. If it's fully just used for work and nothing else? That's not really his half, since it only exists so he can pay rent, and they both need to compromise. If he also uses it as a gaming room/hobby room? That 3rd room should be hers to do with as she pleases.", "And the office is only when he works from home, implying he doesn\u2019t work from home every day.", "Where does it say OP wouldn't use the gym too?", "Women are often marginalised in home spaces. If you look at the wfh data - men get an office. Women work in the kitchen, dining room etc.", "That last part exactly. It is normal, healthy, and necessary to have space apart from your partner. There is nothing wrong with that space being a bedroom, if she wants, or perhaps just a \u201chang out\u201d space or a space dedicated to a hobby. People have a lot of twisted ideas about how you *have* to sleep in the same room as your partner or your relationship is falling apart/someone is cheating/other miscellaneous bullshit. In the end, what works for you best is what\u2019s going to keep you happy in your relationship.", "If he only works from home occasionally, he could easily have a gym with an area for work in the same room.", "This. You might learn new things about yourself, maybe even find that you prefer living alone. \n\nI sure did. I never knew that my mental health could / would drastically improve just by having a space of my own, without interruption from others.", "Do we know that the gym wouldn't be for both of them?", "Oh, women get \"she sheds\" outside.", "I got my space in the end!", "That's a matter of perspective. I completely understand OP wanting her own space. I have ASD, and I need my own space to be alone and decompress. Unfortunately, I can get territorial regarding the space I've designated as my retreat, and I become very stressed and anxious when others are in it. Right now, it's my bedroom. If I was living with a partner, I would not want that to be a room that we're supposed to be sharing.", "They both sound like they have some growing up to do", "Neither my parents nor grandparents slept in the same rooms for 20+ years.  Some people are just not 'sleep compatible'.  My mother always ALWAYS needs the TV to be on, my father needs silence and darkness.  \n\n\nJust saying, it's not as weird as you think it is.", "I'd say OP is NTA because they're bringing up this preference in living conditions before they even move in together.", "Lol I am married and have my own room. It's my crafting room. And no one goes in there but me. not my husband, not my kids. \n\nI agree it's not been talked out. But everyone should be able to have their own safe space. I think it's nut to think just because your married means you can have your own space.", "But she doesn\u2019t want an office, why should she let him decide how all the space is used?", "It sounds like using this room as her personal space every day is more important to her than being able to house the occasional guest.", "His compromise is he gets a room to himself (instead of two) and she gets nothing. That\u2019s not reasonable.", "Being willing to give up just one of the two spare rooms he\u2019d claimed for himself isn\u2019t a compromise when she still gets nothing. It doesn\u2019t sound like he likes her.", "His refusal to meet her well articulated and reasonable need for a private space is weird.", "So he gets an office to himself, a gym to himself, and all she gets is half the bedroom? Why isn't he prepared to share the space.", "Some people need more solitary time to be happy and emotionally healthy. Fulfilling that need for her is not unreasonable. \n\nI wonder why you don\u2019t think his wanting a home office or gym is unreasonable. Why can\u2019t he work and exercise in the living room if constant togetherness is necessary in marriage?", "How is he being unreasonable?  He gave up his gym and offered to make the extra room a spare bedroom?", "Haha... Arguments and fights are perfectly normal in a relationship between two INDIVIDUALS. I would honestly worry if in a relationship there is never a disagreement. And yes sometimes it gets heated and yes sometimes I know I am unreasonable, so I need my space to calm down. And I am an introvert so a room for myself to reload my batteries is also needed for that. I have a crafts room with a bed.\n\nAnyways OP NTA for wanting your own space in your house, perfectly reasonable especially since your partner already has one picked out.", "Who said she wanted a gym? He gets an office to work in that's his space and now wants a gym? Why does he get to have all the rooms dedicated to him?", "But... she doesn't want a home gym? Or an office space? And he's demanding both. Why should he get to decide what both rooms are used for?", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she wants to use his home gym or his office. Why does he get to decide how all space in the house is used?", "It's not. Not even close.", "No it's not. NTA.", "OP isn't clear what the purpose of the room would be. It could be a study for all we know.", "I mean, the whole point is that OP did *not* have her own room her whole life. It's the whole first paragraph.", "It doesn\u2019t really matter if she\u2019s allowed to use it, she\u2019s not interested in having one, or at least not as interested as she is in having a room for herself.", "That\u2019s not how she wants to use this space. He doesn\u2019t get the deciding vote on everything.", "Have you seen her say anywhere that she wants a home gym?", "For real. So many of these comments make me feel suffocated just thinking about what their relationships must be like. Being married does not mean you never get space to be your own person and have your own things.\n\nWe were at an engagement party doing one of those \u2018advice for the couple\u2019 games recently and my husband\u2019s was \u2018it\u2019s OK to have two tubes of toothpaste\u2019: ie, not everything has to be a compromise, sometimes you can just have your own.", "I think it\u2019s still relevant even though I don\u2019t think he should decide what everything\u2019s used for. The difference is having a whole room you don\u2019t let anyone else use versus having a work space that everyone has access too.", "yup. The whole \"we share everything\" is super weird too. \n\nYou need to have alone time so you don't end up losing your entire individuality in your relationship. \n\nNTA I can't believe he wants to take both of the spare rooms.", "He already said he\u2019s willing to give up the gym in order to create a guest room for both of them but that is still not enough for her because she feels that she would  still have to share. YTA is what she is.", "\u201cHis gym\u201d???\nHe already has a whole room to himself. Him giving up one of his TWO rooms is not compromise. And it only becomes fair when she gets a room for herself. When she voiced her need for her room, he should have had empathy and realized her needs are just as important as his. \n\nOP, put the gym equipment in the garage or join a gym, and give the room a purpose for yourself and take it. If he wants a guest room, put a bed in his office (like most guest rooms these days).", "Because his initial position was two rooms for himself and none for her, and his \u2018compromise\u2019 is one room for himself and still none for her.", "I won\u2019t lie, I skimmed and didn\u2019t see the compromise.", "OP is very clear and states \"bedroom\" several times. There is no mention of any other possible role for the room besides that.", "And a stupid reason to waste a perfectly good room.", "Omg! So funny he said that. I can't use the toothpaste my husband  likes because it makes me sick. So I have my own tube. \n\nBut I agree. It makes me feel very suffocate that people are saying you can't have your own space.", "He\u2019s willing to give up one of the rooms he\u2019d claimed for his personal use, but he still gets to decide how it will be used (for something she doesn\u2019t care about). That\u2019s not a compromise.", "Why are you assuming only he would use the gym?", "Where did op say that the gym would only be for the BF?", "A guest room fulfills what she\u2019s looking for but it\u2019s still not good enough for her. There\u2019s no debate regarding the office because he works from home sometimes so an office is needed.", "I\u2026didn\u2019t? I was responding to the characterization of the previous commenter. \n\nTo clarify: maybe they would both be free to use it. But he wants it, OP isn\u2019t interested. His wants shouldn\u2019t be honored and hers ignored. Both should be honored.", "You don\u2019t need to ask this question 50 times on the thread, dude. OP isn\u2019t interested in the gym."]}
