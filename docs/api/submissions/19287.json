If she is going to be busy then I have more time but generally we are 50/50.

I'm not really focused on finding someone right now but a couple of my friends are, how do I put this,  \"aggressively single.\" They'll shoot their shot with everyone. If I happen to meet someone in passing and we click I might pursue something but I'm never out with a \"mission\" on my mind.

I don't see how that's your problem or what you can really do about it. Ideally, they should work on themselves so that something about them is appealing to women too. Otherwise, maybe they should decouple hanging out with you from pursuing women. The solution isn't to ask you to become less attractive.\n\nAlso it's worth noting that (1) maybe the reason is that these women weren't even interested in a relationship in the first place so they were happy to talk about something less flirtatious and (2) it's not even like having a kid is some guaranteed turn on.

People don't like desperation, so if they see someone mature and responsible they'll obviously be more attracted to that person. \n\nYour friends are projecting and need to chill.", "NTA. Sounds like the girls just want to chat to a clearly pleasant, sensible family guy, rather than somebody whose vibe is just screaming 'Shag me now!' ten seconds after being introduced. Maybe if your friends were a bit less desperate, they'd have more success.", "I\u2019m a person who is mostly attracted to women, but I would give the dude telling me about his cute kid waaaaay more of a chance than his creepy friends giving off \u201chit it and quit it\u201d vibes. \n\nEspecially if I was at work and a table/group of shitty guys was aggressively hitting on me while I\u2019m just trying to do my job and he was the only one being respectful.

On top of that, it's clear you love your daughter and spending time with her which are two more 'green flags' for the women. \n\nWhat do your friends do when flirting? If it's the classic yet cringe-y pick up lines (like 'are you from Tennessee? Because you're the only 10 I see' or 'are your legs tired because you've been running through my mind all day') they just might not be the women's type but if they're trying to 'neg' the women...well then I can understand why the women are losing interest in them and focusing on you. \n\n(Also you might want to tell your friends that calling grown women 'girls' may be another reason why they're not getting dates.)", "NTA being a good dad is an attractive trait, especially when you are in your thirties and the women you are pursing are as well. Your friends are just mad they can\u2019t play that card.", "NTA - but if they're bringing you out as a wingman, and you suck as a wingman, don't be surprised if they stop inviting you out.

The women you're talking to aren't uninterested in them because you're there. They're just ignoring your friends' sleaziness faster because you act like a decent human being.

Shame!\"", "it\u2019s gross that we have to make men think about the women close to them to recognize women they don\u2019t know are also people. but that doesn\u2019t take away from your point. op, those women your friends are \u201cexamining\u201d are people the same way your daughter is. your friends will look at her that way as she gets older. how does that make you feel?", "> Want to clarify that I have no problem with my friends.

From the description, they sound like many other insecure young single men to me, but I wouldn't describe that as \"creepy\", more like immature, or unaware. Depends on what age they are. Honestly, for college boys or right out of college, this type of behavior is pretty average. Many young guys don't really know what they're doing around women.", "That\u2019s exactly what it is. Because OP is just a chill guy talking about his daughter, if they aren\u2019t looking to hook up with someone they will obviously feel a lot more comfortable talking to him than some dude that\u2019s hitting on them.
