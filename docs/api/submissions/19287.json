I'm not really focused on finding someone right now but a couple of my friends are, how do I put this,  \"aggressively single.\" They'll shoot their shot with everyone.

I don't see how that's your problem or what you can really do about it. Ideally, they should work on themselves so that something about them is appealing to women too. Otherwise, maybe they should decouple hanging out with you from pursuing women. The solution isn't to ask you to become less attractive.\n\nAlso it's worth noting that (1) maybe the reason is that these women weren't even interested in a relationship in the first place so they were happy to talk about something less flirtatious and (2) it's not even like having a kid is some guaranteed turn on.
