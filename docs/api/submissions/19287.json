We just didn't work out as a couple. We've not had to involve the courts or anything and we share the kid equally. Obviously if I am going to be busy with work for a week she has more time. If she is going to be busy then I have more time but generally we are 50/50. All this to say that my daughter is a big part of my life and I'm not a \"weekend dad\"(no disrespect to fathers who only have that much custody though)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I have free time I hang out with my buddies. I'm not really focused on finding someone right now but a couple of my friends are, how do I put this,  \"aggressively single.\" They'll shoot their shot with everyone. If I happen to meet someone in passing and we click I might pursue something but I'm never out with a \"mission\" on my mind. My focus is mainly on my daughter and career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm out with friends and girls are around us and a couple of my friends are chatting them up. It's a group setting so I will chime in or they'll ask me something. I don't try bring up my daughter quickly but she is the most important part of my life. If I get asked what I like to do or what I did last week. The answer is usually going to involve my daughter. My phone background is a picture of my daughter. I usually leave earlier than others because of her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently a friend told me that I am \"stealing all the attention\" but bringing up my daughter and bragging about how good of a father I am. I've never talked to girls while we were out in a flirtatious way and I don't think I brag. I don't think telling someone you took your kid to the park is bragging. They said the \"dad routine\" is causing girls to lose interest in them and focus on me. Of my group of friends only two of them(the aggressively single ones) have complained about this. I don't want to ruin their night but I can't change my whole personality while out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEXTRA- Want to clarify that I have no problem with my friends. A couple of them are just the type to hit on every woman they see. I've not seen a waitress, bartender, receptionist, nurse, flight attendant etc they haven't tried. Even in passing they are just looking around examining all the women. No shame to him, that's just how he is.

Literally all those situations you list in your edit, for example. Like it sounds mostly like your friends harass women in the job who in turn focus on you and your daughter because you're not being creepy and it makes it harder for your friends to keep hitting on them.\n\nRight now it's NTA, but if you don't see the problem for what it is and reconsider those friendships so your daughter doesn't grow up seeing you excuse creepy misogynist men \"date\" by using women as objects to get laid you'll be the A H.", "NTA as a single woman in your age bracket, you\u2019re not stealing the attention because you have a child, you\u2019re getting the attention because you have something more interesting to talk about then your buddies do.

Your friends need to work on themselves if they want more attention.", "NTA\n\nI think your friends are mistaken about why women seem more interested in you,  and it likely has less to do with you having a daughter than you think.  Many women when they hear a child is involved, the first thing they think about is \"oh great, an ex to deal with, child support to deal with\" not  \n\"Oh what a sweet guy taking his child to the park\".\n\nSince having kids is often a barrier to dating, not an incentive, i offer that your friends more than likely have qualities or behaviors that deflect and push away women, rather than your \"dadness\" being a magnet pulling the women away from them and to you.", "NTA.

Also, are your male friends coming on quite strong to these women?\n\nI suspect the women are showing more interest in you not because you are an active father, but because you aren't 'out on the pull' as we say in the UK. Therefore you're probably having genuine, sincere and respectful conversations with these women, which is an energy they are responding to much more positively than your friends \"want attractive woman for my girlfriend\" energy. I also suspect if any of your friends are father's, they would prefer you match their parenting energy rather than they have to put in more effort to match yours.", "> A couple of them are just the type to hit on every woman they see.

In other words, even if they were right... their premise is... being honest about who you are leads women to prefer you over them... I don't see how that's your problem or what you can really do about it. Ideally, they should work on themselves so that something about them is appealing to women too. Otherwise, maybe they should decouple hanging out with you from pursuing women. The solution isn't to ask you to become less attractive.\n\nAlso it's worth noting that (1) maybe the reason is that these women weren't even interested in a relationship in the first place so they were happy to talk about something less flirtatious and (2) it's not even like having a kid is some guaranteed turn on. Lots of people would be hesitant to get into a relationship with a person who has a kid.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with honestly answering a question someone asks.", "NTA.

I won\u2019t say you\u2019re a bad wingman but they probably feel that your responsible dad vibes really are overshadowing them. \n\nHonestly you don\u2019t have to hide that part of you.
