Within those two years I realized that I put my emotional needs to the side to tend to his. \n\nFor example, if we are both having a bad day, I would put my emotions to the side so he can talk about what is bothering him and I can comfort him. He\u2019s admitted to me that he feels I am the stronger one, emotionally, out of the both of us. Now here is why I get upset and can not tend to his love language. One of his love language is words of affirmation, and he constantly asks me if I still love him or if I\u2019m happy with him. \n\nRecently something happened to me physically where I was in a lot of pain and could only lay down to get some type of relief, if any. My boyfriend was there with me while I was in pain however kept asking me if I still loved him and if i was happy with him. I got fed up to the point where I told him I wouldn\u2019t answer that question anymore and to stop asking me. I could tell I hurt his feelings but I was in a lot of discomfort where I needed him and I got upset that I had to put my physical and emotional suffering to the side to tend to him once again.

In general I would expect your partner to be able to manage to put himself aside at least to some degree to be there for you under circumstances such as these.  \n\nIt also seems odd to me to place the burden or demand of providing these affirmation when you are clearly in a position of needing support. It would possibly be different if he were caring for you and you just thanked him and told him you love and appreciate him rather than him asking you this all the time.
