Maybe you can ask yourself why you end up putting aside your emotional needs to tend to your partner's emotional needs? \n\nWhile you may both gain some benefit from therapy, he is definitely in the wrong here in this situation. Even with all of my own mental health problems, I can't imagine ever seeing my partner struggling in the physical pain you describe and not doing everything in my power to help alleviate that pain. \n\nI hope your recent injury gets better soon!", "NTA. \n\nMy 'receiving' love language is words of affirmation. Which means I respond best  to (when appropriate) thank yous, you did a good job on xyz, I appreciate you doing abc, etc. Instead of, for example, being given a gift as a thank you for doing something for someone. It is not a constant barrage of insecure questions so you keep telling me that you care regardless of what you need. You are not describing a love language; your boyfriend is emotionally insecure, which is not the same thing at all.", "NTA. \n\nThe way in which he is conducting himself is not love language. It sounds like he needs to go to therapy for some self-work and self-learning. \n\nI suggest sitting down with him in a neutral and calm way and let him know how his behaviour is impacting you. Suggest he see someone (a professional) about it. Then agree to sit talk about it again in 1 -2 weeks for example to address how that\u2019s going and make sure the original conversation was productive. \nHave the conversation a chance to hear both sides and thoughts, but maintain your boundaries too. \n\nGood luck and remember this little quote, \u2018don\u2019t light yourself on fire to keep others warm.\u2019", "I had to re-read this because I thought this relationship was between two 14 year olds. \n\nNTA. Your boyfriend needs to learn that there is an appropriate time and place for reaffirmation of your feelings/commitment to him.", "Not wrong but human ..", "NTA\u2026Sounds like your boyfriend needs therapy.   You needed him and all he could do was think of himself.  You needed help.  Now was not the time for him to play on his insecurities.", "NTA. The time is over when women had to totally subordinate their own needs to those of their men. And yours seems worse, he interrupted your actual pain, to demand you reaffirm HIS needs are all that matters.\nYou're doing all the emotional heavy lifting in the relationship; eventually, the labor will wear you out. He's an emotional vampire, and he'll drain you dry.", "NTA but I think both of you have issues to work on therapy.\n\nYour need to hide everything you're feeling and be always \"the stronger one\" probably comes from childhood trauma where you had to constantly be there for other people and never had anyone for you. As much as it's easier to deal with some things this way, it's not healthy. A relationship is a space where both should feel comfortable being vulnerable towards each other and rely on each others.\n\nFor instance, his constant need for reassurance is probably because he has anxious attachment and always had to \"earn\" everyone's love, so he doesn't know how to be loved simply for who he is. \n\nYou're used to have people relying on you and he's used to having to earn other's people's affections. Basically you guys seems to be trauma bounded. But as much as it seems it works, it really doesn't, so you guys have things to address in therapy. \n\nIt makes me wonder why does everyone has a need to be a good guy and a bad guy and why people make your bf a bad guy when he's clearly just anxious just because he's a man.", "Asking constantly - even when you are in pain - is not his love language. Love language is how you show love for others.\n\nHe is needy and annoying. \n\nNTA", "You just realise that this relationship is all about HIM and HIS feelings and you are not that important in his life except as a sounding board to parrot back endless affirmations of his fabulousness.. Yes I made that word up. He sounds exhausting and self centered. NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. \nhonestly talk to him about this and if he gets mad or smth or shoves it aside then this isn\u2019t healthy.\nlike bro is insecure and constantly needs reassurance when YOUR in physical pain. cmon he is not 2.", "This means he should go around affirming people with his words because that\u2019s how he shows love. It doesn\u2019t mean he can demand you to make him feel secure and loved on demand. Another people will never make him feel secure-he has to do the emotional labor and find that within himself. He\u2019s using you as a bandaid", "oh, wow. I think you have managed to blow right past the point where considering wether a relationship is healthy, becomes unhealthy.", "I'm in a 10 year relationship where we constantly ask eachother if we love eachother. \"Do you love me?\" \"Yes\" or \"no\" depending if we wanna tease eachother. Why would u say it's not healthy? Sometimes u just wanna hear the other person say it. Sometimes u are insecure and need validation that everything is alright. You're wrong and I'm sorry for you. This advice is wrong and if she listens to it she's not gonna have a good time. She was sick, he was taking care of her. She was in pain and shut him down. That's all. You're overcomplicating it with your own stuff here. How did he show he's thinking of himself 1st while he's taking care of her? Please...If you want a long term relationship you have to put your partner 1st. Like he did while he was taking care of her. This is just a question", "Making such unconditional statements about something so subjective and abstract as the very concept of *love* must be a really fucking wild way to spend a Friday night.\n\nI mean, we're talking about **LOVE,** a word which is an umbrella term for anything from parental affection to a zealous fondness for beer cheese dip.\n\nTL;DR : Only a Sith deals in absolutes, I will do what I must.", "Yeah, chicks be so demanding, if there's multiple jokes about sth on the internet it must be so for the entire population it is talking about /s", "Which ones did you find disgusting? As far as I can tell most of them (and most upvoted) are saying NTA and that the relationship dynamic obviously isnt working well for OP as it is now, which she expressed herself (she constantly has to put her needs aside). Sure, ultimately she needs to figure it out herself, and it would be nice if she could help bf with his issues of insecurity, but the form of help he's demanding is draining her - doesnt have to be a breakup, but sth needs to change.\nAlso, the point is he maybe took care of her physically but at the same time demanded sth from her while she was the one in need of support and then got upset when she wouldnt do that in her weakened state. That's not ok behavior.", "This! I love (lol) the idea of love languages, because it\u2019s really interesting to see how people can show they care to their friends and family. But this guy? Literally no. He\u2019s just using you to affirm his insecurities. If words of affirmation were really his love language, he would be the one giving with no expectations back.\n\nEdit: I read about this stuff as deeply as I do astrology. Don\u2019t take it as law, just something fun.", "NTA. Words of affirmation are one of my bf\u2019s love languages too, and he has an anxious emotion style, which can make him a bit more needy than my avoidant self. HOWEVER, if he brings something his anxious attachment has flagged to my attention and I fill the need/explain my reasoning for not filling it, I get an upbeat \u201cokay!\u201d and then that\u2019s the end of it. Asking for constant reassurance on the same topic over and over again especially when you listen to him all the time isn\u2019t healthy. You\u2019re not a partner, you\u2019re a therapist, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting enough pay for that.", "You said \"She was sick, he was taking care of her.\"\n\n\"Taking care of her\" is a far reach from...\n\n>My boyfriend was ***there with me*** while I was in pain however kept asking me if I still loved him\n\nAsking **constantly** is fine if BOTH people are cool with it. However in this instance, she isn't and it's starting to grate on her. Honestly I find people who do this insufferable. It goes from cute (if it's every now and then) to annoying very fast, (if it's literally all the time!). She needed him to actually look after her, she was literally in physical pain. Instead it sounds like he was just sitting around asking for validation. That's **not what the situation called for**. I can only go with the side of the story I've heard, there maybe more to it, but anything else is just fabrication at this point.\n\nIf she is **always putting her feelings to the side** to comfort him - and he is never doing it for her - then it's **not** an equal relationship. She might as well be his shrink. Honestly I feel sorry for you if you think that is a healthy relationship lol.
