Something traumatic has happened to your child and she associates grandma with the trauma.\n\nI was traumatized by my cousin when I was your daughter\u2019s age.  He was late teens and he thought it would be funny to emotionally terrorize me.  The specific details aren\u2019t important, but It got so bad that when he came to visit, I would scream and run to my mom.  I refused to go see my aunt because I was afraid he was there.  My parents being young adults too, didn\u2019t understand and didn\u2019t do anything to stop it.  I am almost 60 and I can remember those times as vividly as yesterday.  The only time I ever slept well was when I was married and my husband was by my side.\n\nSo, you need to get your child to an experienced trauma therapist who specifically treats children.  You need someone experienced who can help your child unpack what has her terrorized,  you should also see a pediatrician and have a physical done to make sure there wasnt physical abuse.\n\n3 years old is old enough to ask do you want to sleepover at grandma\u2019s.  It sounds like when you said yes to the overnight, you never asked your daughter.  There should never be overnights or unsupervised visits unless you are asking your child first if that is what they want.  You need to start giving your child control over some of parts of her life, like choosing to do or not visits, etc.\n\nFYI - my son at the same age was suddenly afraid of the dark, specifically his closet.  We all of a sudden we\u2019re having to go through a routine of leaving the closet doors open, having a night light.  Checking everything\u2026. He started having nightmares and running into our bedroom at night.  It drove me crazy trying to figure out what was causing this sudden change in behavior\u2026 I monitored all of his movies, etc.  until one day he put in favorite Disney movie, a cute funny g rated movie, and the movie previews came on and showed a preview of monsters inc.  And suddenly, I found the reason for all the behaviors\u2026. I removed the movie, we had a talk about what he saw, and it was months of undoing all of that damage from a movies preview\u2026\n\nLastly, you and your husband are responsible for the health and well being of your child.  You are not responsible for fulfilling MILs desires.  Your child is not MILs emotional support animal.  Your child has been terrorized by something at MILs house.  You need to eliminate MIL and anything associated with MIL until you find out the source of your child\u2019s terror.  She cannot advocate for herself.  That is your responsibility.", "Yta for forcing her to go overnight when she was clearly distressed what kind of parents are you.", "Thank you! They are the only ones she reacts to like that.

He brushed it off because all I could say was \u201cscary\u201d and he said it was because of the facial hair. He never was alone with me again, but I was still deeply terrified of him. I only saw him once or twice a year and as I got older I would just calmly walk out of the room when he entered. I avoided him at all costs. When I was a teenager he died and I cried. A lot.
