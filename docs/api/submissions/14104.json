She washes them after the bathroom but that's about it unless she is told otherwise. She will constantly wipe her face into her hands or cough/sneeze into her hands. I (the assistant manager) have tried every attempt in the book to get her to understand this is not only disgusting but a health code violation. I don't know if its because she is an older lady or what but she will ignore me, roll her eyes, or just rinse her hands for ten seconds. I tried pulling her aside, in the moment coaching, trying the nice approach but nothing is working.\n\n\nSo onto the incident to bring me to write this post. She was taking care of two customers and was pouring milk from the milk gallon. It was empty so she dropped it on the floor and proceeded to step on it with her foot to crush it. She then picked it up and threw it away then went to continue to make drinks. The customers were watching her whispering and looked uncomfortable. I then sternly asked her 'can you wash your hands please? What you just did is a health code violation.'\n\nShe got an annoyed look on her face and rinsed her hands for ten seconds then grabbed paper towels. I then continued in the same tone 'can you use soap please.'\n\nShe got more annoyed and washed her hands properly. Then after the customers left she came up to me to tell me she didn't appreciate the way I called her out in front of the customers and I should have pulled her aside after they left to tell her to wash her hands. This isn't her first food service job and she knows how to wash her hands. I asked why she didn't and she cut me off saying 'I am not your child do not speak to me like that.'\n\nSo then I explained I have tried pulling her aside in the past and she ignored me. She continued saying 'I am not your child don't speak to me like that.'\n\nI then gave the example if she were the customer in that situation what would she have done? She said she would have walked out. I said 'exactly so why didn't you wash your hands?' \n\nShe continued to say I am not her child however and the message I was trying to get across did not go anywhere so I walked away. She tried to say more things but I said 'we are done with this conversation'\n\nI have gone to my boss in the past and she gave me the advice I listed above which didn't work. I also can't write her up because my boss will throw the write up out as she likes this barista since they go to the same church.\n\nAITA for sternly asking my barista to wash her hands?\n\nEdit to add: I wasn't dismissing her feelings during the conversation she had every right to be upset however where this is a reoccurring issue I am at my wits end to get her to follow basic health code. I was trying to get her to see it from my point of view", "created_utc": 1680738316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12d278f/aita_for_sternly_telling_my_barista_to_wash_her/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
