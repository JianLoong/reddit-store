All of us kids are adults and don\u2019t live at home, though my youngest sister was still at home when the divorce was going through.\n\nWe do Christmas with my family every other year, and our spouses families every other year. Post-divorce, it has been hosted by the siblings and we let my parents come on separate days. This year it\u2019s our family\u2019s turn and the usual routine is to stay at my older sisters, who has a big house. That was slightly up in the air and the siblings were chatting about maybe doing it differently. \n\nMid-october my mom announces to us all that she\u2019s rented a house and gives us dates to come stay in the days following Christmas. She has a terrible history of power-plays and I didn\u2019t really trust this. My siblings were mostly ambivalent to my concerns, but I convinced them we needed to have some solidarity so I replied to her email on behalf of all of us and said that we were already planning Christmas, but if she wanted her days to be at this house we could make that work. I also asked why she didn\u2019t talk to us about planning, and whether my dad was invited knowing he likely wasn\u2019t but wanting to clear the air on that. She have a brief reply ignoring all of my questions and saying that she\u2019d host us on the day.\n\nSoon after, us siblings are trying to plan our Christmas events. My youngest sister opts not to show up and says they have no preference. My older sister (the one who usually hosts) shares that my mom and youngest sister were going to come to her house for Christmas. Knowing this, we all agree it would be easiest to just do Christmas at her house again. A few days after we settle on this, my youngest sister asks us why we are traveling there and says she won\u2019t come because they don\u2019t want to travel. She is 19 and very emotional immature, so when we explain that she told us she didn\u2019t care she hurls insults and leaves the group chat. \n\nWhen I tell my mom that we\u2019re going to my oldest sisters instead she says she\u2019s not coming unless my youngest sister does. I convinced her to meet with me and I did my best to ask what she felt like I wasn\u2019t understanding and implored her to come to the family Christmas. She argued with me (often outright berating me in a public setting) about how our gathering isn\u2019t \u201cfamily Christmas\u201d, then complaining that we didn\u2019t involve her in planning while side stepping me pointing out that she didn\u2019t involve us in planning her.\n\nI\u2019m obviously quite mad at her, as well as my little sister but less so because she\u2019s being enabled by my mom, and frankly my other siblings who I think are going to my moms Christmas as well. \n\nDid my best to stay as objective as possible, but let me know if I can clarify anything.", "created_utc": 1703175153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nqkn0/aita_for_thwarting_my_moms_attempts_at/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I really had trouble following this.  But it comes down to one thing.  Your family has a history or Christmas drama, and it casts a pall over everyone's celebrations.  Starting next year, consider something different.  Set out a date and time you are going to host a gathering, and make it clear that whoever of your family members wishes to come is welcome.", "So your mom is controlling and came up with a plan to host everyone for Christmas and no one else, but you, seems to mind. Despite everyone else seeming to be fine with her plan, you have decided to block her idea, even signing everyone\u2019s names to your email, even though they weren\u2019t entirely on board. Now there are hiccups with the new plan, so, rather than talking with your youngest sister to hear her reservations, you dismiss her feelings by saying she\u2019s emotionally immature, and confront your mom in public, where everything devolves into a public fight.\n\nI say this as someone who has spent my life trying to thwart my own parents\u2019 power plays and controlling behavior and have come to realize that I\u2019ve taken on some of the very behavior I hate: it sounds like you and your mom share the need to control and call the shots. I know you have good intentions, but your post was rife with examples of you steamrolling others in the name of making sure your mom didn\u2019t get her way. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to dump on you at all, as I realize there are a lifetime of layers and examples and reasons why you feel the need to control this so much and you may be 1000% right about every single one of your fears. But, if no one else is concerned with your mom\u2019s plans, YTA for turning this into a thing. Sometimes people change, but more often everyone else need reminders of why a good plan and solidarity are key.", "ESH you and your mom are both controlling. I suggest sticking to your husbands family every year and extracting yourself from this drama", "NTA. You're the hero who saved Christmas from your mom's power-hungry plot. If she wants drama, tell her to audition for a soap opera. Your family Christmas is not a stage for her one-woman show.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think in trying to stay objective I made it a little convoluted. \n\nWhat you\u2019re saying I should do, is basically what I\u2019m trying to do this year. I told my mom I would go to the Christmas that everyone planned collectively, and that I think it\u2019s a bad precedent to set that anyone can skip it and try to do their own. There are two grandkids in the mix now (one mine) and I think this sets us on a track of three christmases (siblings, mom, dad) and that\u2019s just shitty for everyone IMO.", "I had a hard time following it, too, and gave up three quarters in, but do agree on the ESH.  It screams family drama!!!", "I really appreciate this response!\n\nI would like to contextualize a few things, and see if your mind is changed.\n\nI was not alone in concerns about my mom, and I had the support of all siblings and my wife and sister in law but my younger sister. No email was sent without input from everyone else. \n\nI absolutely tried to talk to my younger sister, we all did, but she threw walls in our face and accused of us things plainly not true. I can list examples if you like. \n\nI also initially tried to talk to my mom in private, and she slipped out and said she\u2019d talk another time. I offered to meet her in public specifically because I didn\u2019t want things to get out of hand because she can be a lot in private. My brother also met with her and brought his wife, and they had a terrible experience as well. \n\nFinally, not everyone is okay with her plan. For one, it only allows for half a Christmas since we also have to figure out what to do with my dad. My brother and his wife are against it pretty firmly, and my sister expresses frustration but ultimately just doesn\u2019t want conflict so she\u2019s going with whatever. It\u2019s my youngest sister that\u2019s the only real holdout, and to be frank my mom showers her with gifts and enables her worsening substance abuse which makes her more on her side. \n\nNow, I do think you\u2019re right in saying that both my mom and I seek control. However, I want to emphasize that what I have pushed for with my siblings this entire time is that *we*, collectively, should make plans and not allow my mom to make them for us.", "So, my main question here is: I am defaulting to the Christmas plan that all the siblings collectively organize. My mom is planning her own and pushing it. Doesn\u2019t that make us different?", "I would say don't do drama at all.  You have your own family now, and you can do your own traditions.", "\ud83d\ude02 you don\u2019t know the half of it. There\u2019s like 3 other subplots going on right now. \n\nMy siblings and I were discussing our frustrations and my brother pulled emails from a few years ago, pre divorce, of my mom ignoring the Airbnb we all had agreed on and requested she get and getting a totally different one in a random place in Ohio. This shit has been going on for years", "It does, you're NTA.", "No. Your siblings don\u2019t care if your mom takes over the event. Only you care and only you\u2019re making it an issue. If they were all upset and against it than your be more in the right but your not. Why not just go to your husbands family and leave them to their plans with your mom?", "Well, one tradition I want to have is seeing my siblings!", "It might be time to start your OWN Christmas traditions!", "Well, my brother and his wife are against it and my sister generally isn\u2019t happy with how this is going and the one condition for her this year was being at her house on Christmas Day for her daughters first real Christmas. So I feel like I\u2019ve got the collective will. \n\nAlso, I like seeing my siblings! But yes, if this is the shit show to expect every other year we\u2019ll just skip this and go to my wife\u2019s family.", "And you can prioritize that, but if they won\u2019t then you aren\u2019t seeing them. You can\u2019t control other peoples actions.\n\nMy parents are also divorced and I\u2019m dealing with this Christmas drama. The best thing you can do is do what best for you and hope for the best while having backup plans for the worst.", "That\u2019s the general goal here. Siblings plan and parents are invited. I told my mom that when she met and that tipped her off big time. Apparently it\u2019s her \u201cright\u201d to plan the Christmas gathering. \ud83d\ude43", "Sorry yes wife\u2019s."]}
