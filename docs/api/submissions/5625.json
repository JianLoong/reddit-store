{"id": 5625, "submission_id": "zv4j5j", "title": "AITA for refusing to translate anime and kicking a girl out ?", "selftext": " \n\nMy friends and I had a game night on Friday evening. We ordered some take outs and played some board games, drunk some beer, etc. one of my friends invited his new girlfriend to join us (Sandra) which was totally fine with everyone, we\u2019ve all invited extra people at one point or another.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m a white woman who\u2019s in her early thirties and I speak fluent Japanese and work as an interpreter (from Japanese to my native language and English isn\u2019t my native language so forgive any mistakes). My high school offered Japanese classes with a native speaker when anime was slowly gaining popularity in Europe (mid to late 00s) and I took it because the classes where in English which I wanted to improve. I ended up falling in love with the language (Japanese) and ended up pursuing it for my degree. For context, when I was doing my bachelors, there were 20 people doing it, now the same university has 150 places. It\u2019s crazy how popular it\u2019s gotten in the past 15 years. Anyway, I digress. Sandra noticed all of my books which are in a few different languages and she got super excited when she saw Japanese ones. She was talking my head off all night and I tried to be as polite as possible even though I was bored. I\u2019ll admit, I don\u2019t see the appeal of anime and I don\u2019t watch it but if you like it, you do it. However, Sandra couldn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s not something I watch, she kept insisting that I must love it hence me learning the language. No amount of explanation worked, she just wouldn\u2019t let me talk to other people. I understand excitement, etc, but it was too much. I was so exhausted after that night.\n\nOn Saturday, she knocked on my door (without my friend, her boyfriend). I opened it without it looking. Apparently, we\u2019re now besties\u2026 She kept talking and talking and asked me to translate some subtitles for her. I replied that unfortunately I didn\u2019t have time to do it. She was persistent thought so I told her that sure, I\u2019ve got a slot open for August and it\u2019s x amount of money per character and give her rough estimate. Saying that she was pissed off is an understatement. She started screaming at me for gatekeeping (wtf) anime and Japanese language, that I didn\u2019t have a right to do that and as a white woman who\u2019s earning money on minority\u2019s language, I should at least share my services for free. She was extremely rude so I kicked her out.\n\nWell, her boyfriend called me later and got really pissed off because she told him completely twisted version of events and now he\u2019s angry with me.\n\nMy boyfriend thinks that I should\u2019ve just translated it this once just to be nice because she was probably just trying to become friends with me. And now I don\u2019t know, maybe I was too harsh and should\u2019ve just helped her this once.

And coming to your house uninvited for a repeat makes it even worse. People who are trying to be friends actually listen to other people.", "NTA. I work as an interpreter (different languages from yours), and I know how much work goes into translating materials. You have the right to a fair wage for your time and skills.", "NTA at all. You\u2019re fine. She was being pushy and weird. And then she tried to gain the moral high ground by acting all woke with terms like gatekeeping and acting as if you speaking Japanese as a white woman is somehow racist? While assuming speaking Japanese makes you an automatic anime fan? \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on in this argument.", "Why did you steal this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wc16ya/aita_for_kicking_a_girl_out_after_she_got_angry/)  ?????", "Just imagine life if you did translate that first set and convinced this girl that you were indeed best friends.  Oh the joys of dealing with her all the time.", "NTA, you do you. IMO kick her out, kick her bf out, and if your bf has a problem with you culling rude and toxic people, kick his ass to the curb too...do some pre-spring cleaning lol.", "You need to come teach me how to have boundaries.\n\nThis situation would have eventually come to this, and it will with her boyfriend, too. Just wait.", "NTA. If what you're saying is true (which I assume you have no reason to lie), then it's odd she doesn't get that Japanese isn\u2019t JUST about anime. You were more than polite to put up with her talking about it for an entire evening. If she showed up at your door, that in itself isn't bad\nbut still refusing to take a hint with the anime is. Telling her you have a slot and will charge by the character might be a tad asshole-y (though I'd probably do the same if I was annoyed, so no judgement!) \n\nAnd btw, your boyfriend saying you should've done it once is just naive, there's no way she would stop at that. \n\nAlso, for the white woman learning a minority language, I'm curious if she's also white because that sounds so hypocritical. If you have the drive and degree for learning Japanese, you owe nobody else that service for free! Definitely NTA.", "NTA, she asked you to do what you do for a living for free.", "NTA.  It took a long time to develop your skills and talent for translation. And it take skills and talent to actually produce a (written) translation. The only reasons you should produce a translation for her are if you want to do it and if she's willing to pay for it?  I have no doubt that someone else is willing to translate the anime:  why should you undercut them and take away their livelihood?  I hope that you price you quoted her was high enough to reflect your non-interest in her project.\n\nIt's also incredibly rude and entitled of her to think that you, or anyone, would drop all their other projects and assume that you would work on the translations.  Uhh, \"no, thank you.\"", "NTA- she showed up to your door without an invitation or I assume even your phone number to ask if it\u2019d be ok to stop by. I don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve gone the route of giving her your rate since she is dating one of your friends, it\u2019s a little jerky but she was also being very self involved and not respectful of your time and space either.", "Minority language?

She tried to haggle you to do paid services (for which you sacrificed years of time and effort) for free and tried guilt tripping you when you said no. Also, she tried to (after only meeting you once) act like your best buds to put added pressure on you. Trust me, if you had given in this one time, you'd have never heard the end of it. She would have just kept bugging you with (unpaid) requests.\n\n\n\n\nI have just scratched the surface and we've already unveiled multiple toxic or at the very least insensitive or worrying aspects of her behavior.
