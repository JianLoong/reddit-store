I think nudity is fine, some people think it's uncomfortable, regardless of who is right or wrong the overall goal is peacefully sharing a home with people you love. Maybe if you show your wife you're willing to compromise with the robe you can work out a few more ground rules like being naked in the bedroom or past normal bedtime.\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't think a 4 year old is going to be \"traumatized\" by nudity -- honestly seeing casual nudity seems a lot less traumatizing than all the shame around nudity. I feel like a teenager might have some strong thoughts about it though, so you might want to get in the habit of embracing robe culture before then.
