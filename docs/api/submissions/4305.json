My husband asked him how much he had saved so that he could help pitch in if needed because we live in a 2 bed room and babies take up space. He refuses to tell him what he has saved and anytime we try to show him apartments or homes for rent he brushes it off.

Our agreement was to allow him to live here for a couple months so he could save to get his own place. Not only has it been over a year but he is kinda inconsiderate.

He sounds awful.", "NTA. This derelict has overstayed his welcome by a year. Ignore his family. Are they all mooches too? Get him the heck out of there before Christmas.", "NTA but you may legally have to give him 30 days' notice", "NTA\n\nThere's a very good reason your family is telling you to put up with him: it's so they don't have to. I think that having over a year to save up (like he's eating your food, smoking your weed, and not contributing, short of a phone bill, car payment, and insurance he shouldn't have any other expenses) is very reasonable. Probably not a house unless the guy is making some serious money, but definitely some sort of apartment. Where did he exactly come from before? Was he living with other relatives before he moved in with you guys?", "NTA\n\n>we invited him into our home we can\u2019t just kick him out\n\nOf course you can. It\u2019s your home and you decide who gets to live there.\n\n>Our agreement was to allow him to live here for a couple months \n\nSo you have more than kept your end of the bargain - \u201ca couple months\u201d has long passed. I don\u2019t believe the agreement was \u201cwill house and feed and clean up after and support him for eternity\u201d.\n\nIt certainly sounds like you need to formally serve him with eviction paperwork if this is necessary where you live, although some places may not consider him a tenant if he has never paid anything. You need to learn what is required by your local laws.\n\nPerhaps all the complaining relatives are scared that when you get him out, he\u2019ll try to move in with them. I think you should print out some nice maps and directions to their houses.", "INFO just checking, you realize you aren\u2019t helping him by letting him stay right? BIL is suffering, because he\u2019s being stunted, mommyfied, coddled. It\u2019s enabling on a completely destructive level, so insidious, that his brain is beginning to believe he isn\u2019t capable of living without your care.\n\nYou know how those mothers make their kids sick for the attention? What you are doing to him is something like that, the difference is, you have him believing you are helping him, and he believes he needs your help.\n\nHe needs to get out ASAP. He needs to live in his own. He needs to either find a studio apartment, or a room on Craigslist. He needs to build back his self sufficiency, and that only happens when he does the hard work himself.\n\nThis needs to happen to help him to begin his life, without you propping him up.  He might whine, and cry, and claim he\u2019s unable to stand on his own, but that\u2019s only the mental trickery working against all of you.\n\nHe needs to find a place he can afford tomorrow, start looking immediately.\n\nHelp him. Give him back his life. He deserves to be free.", "NTA for kicking him out, but you probably legally have to give him more notice.\n\nI'd bet the reason he won't talk about his savings is because he hasn't saved anything. Maybe the family who is so worried about you kicking him out to make room for your child have guest rooms for him to stay in.", "NTA, but you need to do some research regarding tenancy laws in your city/state, because he has definitely lived with you long enough to have established tenancy, and will therefore have rights. You may not legally be able to kick him out without more notice.", "NTA\n\nInform them they are generous to offer up their places for him since he needs someone else to leech off of.\n\nHe is a grown man who has made no attempts to move out. Evicting him ia the only way because his original plan was not to go anywhere. \n\nHe has such a cushy set up there why would he move. He has a maid and a cook and everything is paid for.\n\nKick him out. He will never leave otherwise.", "NTA. He can and should kick him out. The ppl taking up from him can take him in.", "NTA, jeez, no, you don't owe him a free home just because he'd prefer being a freeloader! He should be embarrassed!", "Nta. Put his crap out front and change the locks. He's a bum", "Nta", "NTA. Five months ago you and he agreed on \"a couple months\" which in my world is two or three. In the meantime, he's been lazy, greedy, and unhelpful. Enough already. You owe him nothing.", "NTA - Pack him up and drop him at the most vocal family member's door. After all, he needs a place to stay and he is family. Surely they will be fine to take him in!\n\n(There was a post a while back where someone actually did that. They were judged NTA)", "NTA, you've been doormats long enough.", "You gave him a (free) place to stay for over a year OP, of course you are now obligated to support him for eternity \ud83e\udd23 nta. You should always prioritize your child.", "No savings is likely.", ">\"...we invited him into our home we can\u2019t just kick him out because we had a kid..\"\n\nOf course you can! In fact that is like the one unassailable reason to do so. The fact is, they don't want to have to deal with him so they're trying to put this on you. Hold firm, give him an official 30 day notice (for legal reasons, he's probably considered a tenant at this point so best to do it by the books) and tell anyone who gives you grief about it \"Great, I'll have him and his things sent over to your place right now).\n\nYou have a baby coming and not only will you need the room the stress this guy is causing is bad for the baby. Your husband should have had him out months ago. Tell him he's an AH too for not prioritizing his wife and child.\n\nNTA", "If family is so mad, they can take him in!\nNTA", "NTA. You should check to see what the laws are in your area to evict a tenant. \n\nEven though he\u2019s not paying, he could legally be considered a tenant.  You might have to send him eviction papers to make it legal.", "THIS.  Help move him in with those who are shaming you.", "What family member is us jumping???", "NTA- of course, those family that are kicking off should be taking their turn at housing him and see how they like it! You\u2019ve done more than enough and your husband needs to kick his brother out himself.", "Nta. He isnt contributing money and is smoking all yoru stuff and eating all your food. Plus him smoking in the house with a baby is so horrid. He is a grown man who can either sink or swim but you cant hold him up forever.", "NTA. Hes mooching off you guys. Tell his family that they should take him in as they are so concerned about him. \n\nA mooch with class is enjoyable to be around. A mooch who is inconsiderate deserves to be kicked out.", "You have a 2 bed \u2026 give them eviction papers the room now belongs to baby. You let him in for 2 months that is well gone \u2026 he has out stayed his welcome.", "Tell your family to take him in if they want him to have a home so badly.", "NTA. He is mooching off of you. He has had over a year to save his funds.", "NTA his free ride is over", "Nta\n\nYes you can just kick him out after the legal amount of notice", "NTA. He can go live with all the people who complained.", "NTA\u2026.I highly recommend the every person who called you an asshole you message saying what time is good for me to drop brother off at your place? For every month you take care of brother I will let him stay one month with me after he stays with y\u2019all. I\u2019m so glad you realize brother needs help so what months do you all want to take? \n\nAfter everyone else is done I\u2019ll add up the months and allow bro to stay with me!!! I guarantee this will left with crickets. Then no one can say shit. Especially after your very generous offer. \n\nI would very much have paperwork in order to evict him if he refuses to leave by the end of the month. In CA it\u2019s $800 to file and have it served properly.\n\nEdit for typo", "I've read enough of these posts to know when the family is calling you an AH and telling you to let the person stay, it's because they don't want to be next.
