He sounds awful.", "NTA. This derelict has overstayed his welcome by a year. Ignore his family. Are they all mooches too? Get him the heck out of there before Christmas.", "NTA but you may legally have to give him 30 days' notice", "NTA\n\nThere's a very good reason your family is telling you to put up with him: it's so they don't have to. I think that having over a year to save up (like he's eating your food, smoking your weed, and not contributing, short of a phone bill, car payment, and insurance he shouldn't have any other expenses) is very reasonable. Probably not a house unless the guy is making some serious money, but definitely some sort of apartment. Where did he exactly come from before? Was he living with other relatives before he moved in with you guys?", "NTA\n\n>we invited him into our home we can\u2019t just kick him out\n\nOf course you can. It\u2019s your home and you decide who gets to live there.\n\n>Our agreement was to allow him to live here for a couple months \n\nSo you have more than kept your end of the bargain - \u201ca couple months\u201d has long passed. I don\u2019t believe the agreement was \u201cwill house and feed and clean up after and support him for eternity\u201d.\n\nIt certainly sounds like you need to formally serve him with eviction paperwork if this is necessary where you live, although some places may not consider him a tenant if he has never paid anything. You need to learn what is required by your local laws.\n\nPerhaps all the complaining relatives are scared that when you get him out, he\u2019ll try to move in with them. I think you should print out some nice maps and directions to their houses.", "INFO just checking, you realize you aren\u2019t helping him by letting him stay right? BIL is suffering, because he\u2019s being stunted, mommyfied, coddled. It\u2019s enabling on a completely destructive level, so insidious, that his brain is beginning to believe he isn\u2019t capable of living without your care.\n\nYou know how those mothers make their kids sick for the attention? What you are doing to him is something like that, the difference is, you have him believing you are helping him, and he believes he needs your help.\n\nHe needs to get out ASAP. He needs to live in his own. He needs to either find a studio apartment, or a room on Craigslist. He needs to build back his self sufficiency, and that only happens when he does the hard work himself.\n\nThis needs to happen to help him to begin his life, without you propping him up.  He might whine, and cry, and claim he\u2019s unable to stand on his own, but that\u2019s only the mental trickery working against all of you.\n\nHe needs to find a place he can afford tomorrow, start looking immediately.\n\nHelp him. Give him back his life. He deserves to be free.", "NTA for kicking him out, but you probably legally have to give him more notice.\n\nI'd bet the reason he won't talk about his savings is because he hasn't saved anything. Maybe the family who is so worried about you kicking him out to make room for your child have guest rooms for him to stay in.", "NTA, but you need to do some research regarding tenancy laws in your city/state, because he has definitely lived with you long enough to have established tenancy, and will therefore have rights. You may not legally be able to kick him out without more notice.", "NTA\n\nInform them they are generous to offer up their places for him since he needs someone else to leech off of.\n\nHe is a grown man who has made no attempts to move out.

In fact that is like the one unassailable reason to do so. The fact is, they don't want to have to deal with him so they're trying to put this on you. Hold firm, give him an official 30 day notice (for legal reasons, he's probably considered a tenant at this point so best to do it by the books) and tell anyone who gives you grief about it \"Great, I'll have him and his things sent over to your place right now).\n\nYou have a baby coming and not only will you need the room the stress this guy is causing is bad for the baby.

Help move him in with those who are shaming you.", "What family member is us jumping???", "NTA- of course, those family that are kicking off should be taking their turn at housing him and see how they like it!
