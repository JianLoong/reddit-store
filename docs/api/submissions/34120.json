They regularly ask me for favors for their kids/grandkids but clearly I wasn't important enough to get a heads up text. Let them know I was disappointed they did not inform me they wouldn't be attending as we were waiting on them. Sister responds and makes a thinly veiled threat because she says I disrespected her. \n\nSo I live 2 hours away from my dad and he wanted to hang out for NYE. A few days ago my sister texts me that she heard our dad was visiting and she wanted to come hang out since she has never had the chance to do anything for NYE. In that conversation she invites her mom , step dad, my niece and her 2 grandkids (1 belongs to my neice) They all live in the same town I do only 15 mins away. I hadn't really budgeted for extra people. I only originally expected 7 (including my boyfriend and his family) but I decided to make it work. So we went to lots of different stores to add to the entrees and appetizers including buying regular soda. (This is important because we only drink zero or diet and my dad doesnt consume soda) I confirmed with them twice earlier yesterday and then even set up the party outdoors with patio heaters and our fireplace table since my sister is allergic to cats. This included deep cleaning , making sure everyone's clothes never came in contact with our cats, and using lint rollers on everything to eliminate any chance of cat hair. My dad arrived on time. A little after 10 I text my niece and sister that I turned on the smart lights so they can fnd my house since I live in a rural area. Niece never answers me. My sister only texts me that she had a drink ( 30 mins later).  They also regularly ask me for favors for their kids/grandkids or ask for my help with finding a new job or making resumes and expect immediate answers. My sister responded later today and made a thinly veiled threat as she took offense to me expressing that I was disappointed they could not inform me they weren't coming.
