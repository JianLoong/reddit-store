They regularly ask me for favors for their kids/grandkids but clearly I wasn't important enough to get a heads up text.

A few days ago my sister texts me that she heard our dad was visiting and she wanted to come hang out since she has never had the chance to do anything for NYE. In that conversation she invites her mom , step dad, my niece and her 2 grandkids (1 belongs to my neice) They all live in the same town I do only 15 mins away. I hadn't really budgeted for extra people. I only originally expected 7 (including my boyfriend and his family) but I decided to make it work. So we went to lots of different stores to add to the entrees and appetizers including buying regular soda. (This is important because we only drink zero or diet and my dad doesnt consume soda) I confirmed with them twice earlier yesterday and then even set up the party outdoors with patio heaters and our fireplace table since my sister is allergic to cats. This included deep cleaning , making sure everyone's clothes never came in contact with our cats, and using lint rollers on everything to eliminate any chance of cat hair. My dad arrived on time. A little after 10 I text my niece and sister that I turned on the smart lights so they can fnd my house since I live in a rural area. Niece never answers me. My sister only texts me that she had a drink ( 30 mins later).  They also regularly ask me for favors for their kids/grandkids or ask for my help with finding a new job or making resumes and expect immediate answers. My sister responded later today and made a thinly veiled threat as she took offense to me expressing that I was disappointed they could not inform me they weren't coming.

She's just salty that you're right, she was rude.", "NTA but next time they self-invite tell them no. Also stop jumping to their tune re resumes, jobs and help with kids.\n\nI'm still mad st my sister for demanding I do her resume right then to apply for a transfer to govt job in another state; she never applied.", "Clearly NTA. No matter what relation she is to you she can\u2019t walk all over you like that. You are the host and therefore you deserve to know who and how many people are coming to your house and everything else", "Why are you in contact with her? Cut her off.", "Nta and stop doing favors for them", "NTA\n\nUnless there was a serious misunderstanding it is just absurd to invite yourself and a bunch of other people and then not show up. Anyone would be annoyed by that unless there was a great reason. (e.g. if no one mentioned it because they were overwhelmed by someone suddenly being in the hospital and they forgot then that'd be somewhat understandable)\n\nShe can \"take offense\" as much as she likes, she was very rude to change your plans this much and then not even take responsibility and mention that they aren't going to make it. That isn't okay behavior, most older teens would realize that you are obligated to call or text and explain.", "NTA. Sounds like she and her family are using you quite often. Just stop with doing favors for any of them and don't invite them again until they honestly and properly apologized to you. That should include an apology gift as recompense.", "Someone as ungrateful as OP's sister does not deserve all the effort OP went through for the party and other favours.\n\nI would hope that OP's dad would have your back and talk to your sister", "That I clearly don't know who she is or who I'm messing with. For additional context:  She has attempted to assault another sibling in the past over a disagreement. Anger issues and impulsiveness I thought she moved past over the years", "Say it louder! It hurts my heart they are doing this to OP who seems to bend over backwards for them!", "OPs sister doesn't even deserve the time that OP spent on this post. He could just cut her off for good.", "Keep all the receipts for every interaction. \n\nNTA and Godspeed", "Go lc", "Go no contact with your sister. With the rest of her family, too, if they don't bother to at least apologize to you.", "For 2024 anything they ask for the answer is No", "You're allowed to say no.. Nta", "Good on you for standing up to her!\n\nIf she's doing that now I can't imagine what she'd do in the future when she doesn't get something she wants from you. I'd outright tell her that if she wants to threaten you then you won't be allowing contact anymore for your safety. I'd also make your father aware and just block her. You don't deserve to be threatened or mistreated like you are and if she wishes to continue being volatile she should do it to a brick wall.\n\nPlease be safe, that matters more than anything else, including her hurt ego.", "I did opt to block communication. I also informed our dad of my choice and he supports the decision"]}
