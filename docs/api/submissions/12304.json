If she doesn't like it, say, \"We'll send you some nice portraits.\"", "Why don't you plan a wedding you and your furnace can afford, don't accept any money from either of your parents? They may not be happy but you'll have the wedding you want. Accepting money for a wedding always comes with a few strings attached", "NTA. It's not help when it's held over your head. That's called manipulation. Your lives are to intertwined with theirs and they know it. This gives them power. Time to start saving for a new place and looking for new jobs. It might not happen over night. But it needs to happen. Bc this is only going to get worse when you have the baby. \"I can come by any time I want to see my grand baby. What do you mean I can't babysit when ever I want and demand your time?\" You get the picture.", "NTA put a stop to that now. You told her your mom is paying for catering and she said she\u2019ll do it herself? Nobody asked her. Ask her to pay for the cake", "You had us at the title. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, it\u2019s your day not hers. At the least with her attitude she should be treated like an ordinary guess, no information other than the invite until the day.", "NTA. Your MIL should butt out, especially as no one asked her opinion. Now, if your MIL wants to plan a wedding so badly, she should get married herself/vow renewal type thingy.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding, you should call the shots.", "NTA\n\nGo back to your plan to have a courthouse wedding.  Your MIl and Mom can host a reception later for their friends and family that they pay for and plan, without hassling you about it.", "Absolutely NTA. We ran into something like this when planning our vow renewal (since we had a court house ceremony and still wanted to do the full thing later). We had to set some pretty strong boundaries with her as she wanted to run the whole show.\n\nTrying to at least compromise, I asked her if she could make the cream cheese mints. I even gave her fabric swatches of our colors to help. When I went to pick them up, not only were they the wrong colors, they were also chocolates and not mints.\n\nEven better? The ceremony was the same day as my SIL's 21st birthday, who was one of my bridesmaids. We asked her at least a dozen times if she was okay with the timing of things, to which she always enthusiastically agreed. \n\nFast forward to our reception; the bridal party has just made their entrance, and before any of the special dances can even start, my MIL comes raging across the floor to the DJ and (loudly) demands to do the Mother & Son dance because, get this, she had planned a \"special\" birthday party for my SIL and they had to leave the reception early.", "ESH. You think you're mature enough for marriage and a baby, you should be able to say \"no\" to your future MIL over wedding choices.
