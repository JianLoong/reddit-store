Until relatively recently, women couldn't have bank accounts or open lines of credit. 100ish years ago, women couldn't own property and couldn't vote. Women could only get domestic labor related jobs that paid less. All of this is still a problem today because there is still a pervasive belief (especially among religious people with patriarchal values) that women are subject to men and are valuable primarily as sex objects, wives/domestic servants, and baby makers. Things are better now but it takes time to address generations of injustice and all that generational trauma is passed down mother to daughter. \n\nPart of achieving equality so that women don't have to \"use\" men as providers is for men to step up on the domestic duties they have been neglecting so women can work and earn to provide for themselves/contribute to the household.\n\nAll of this is a long way of saying your friend has responsibility in this situation.

I'm just going to talk about a pattern I see with men who cry about women being gold diggers or women not wanting to hold a guy down when he's poor or whatever. So hear me out, and although this might not mirror your story, it's still a guideline to what it is they're trying to get at:\n\nMen, particularly cis/het men love having all the benefits of the patriarchy (stay-at-home wife who wants for nothing, the glory of being a provider, kids, a picket fence, etc etc) but want NONE of the physical and emotional baggage of the patriarchy that'd be their only way of *retaining* the things that they want, ie. having a job and being a sole breadwinner.\n\nSo when the well runs dry, of course things start to fall apart. Men always want to blame women for actually believing in this decades-long propaganda. They blame them for being upset when the life this system promises both of them doesn't always work out. This idea of \"wahh women will leave you if you can't provide\" is a sort of existential fear that the crushing weight of capitalism will render them unable or unwilling to maintain the lifestyle the patriarchy promises them. So they shift the blame and make it a problem about loyalty.\n\nAs heavy and loaded as what I say may sound, just know that this is a pattern I always find with these types of people. Also, I agree that there's probably more to this problem than just finances alone. Child rearing is the most overlooked, exhausting, and unacknowledged work. And the fact that all of your friends completely skim over that as the reason for why she doesn't want the relationship anymore, just proves the point. And just because you're a lesbian doesn't mean that you wouldn't have the same problems they claim you won't understand. Money is money, child rearing is child-rearing. When you live in a society that holds so much weight on BOTH of those issues, with little outside help beyond the family unit, and neither your partner or you can't hold your fair share? Your relationship may crumble. But instead of these guys looking inward, or trying to hear their partners out, or trying to adjust their attitude and way of doing things *slightly*, they just blame the women. UGH.  \n\n\nEDIT: And although I know your friend is also a working woman, the same guideline applies. Doesn't want to maintain or at least \\*help\\* maintain what life has given him, and blames it on the girl if she leaves him.", ">The friends are split, some say it's true, women always leave men when they stop providing and I wouldn't understand because I'm gay.\n\nScrew these 'friends'.", "NTA.

It\u2019s not all relationships of course, and SAHD are becoming more common, but there are certain gendered issues/expectations that still disproportionately affect the women in an opposite sex relationship. \n\nHowever unlike previous generations, women of my age grew up being told \u2018girl power\u2019 meant we could have whatever career goals we wanted, we were just as capable as boys and we don\u2019t need a man to rely on. Plus very few households can survive on one income anyway in this cost of living crisis. But the increased opportunity and expectation for work outside of the home has not been coupled with a proportional lowering/sharing of the work within the average household. At the same girls that were being told they could have anything they put their minds to they were growing up alongside brothers who were not being taught the value in \u2018girly\u2019 things like compassion and taking the mental load. Many (realistically most) of us grew up seeing our mothers be the default caregivers and household managers in the majority of household. Those expectations are then very hard to break and continue on to the next generation who still see their mothers take on the bulk of those responsibilities and either juggle a career alongside it or take a step back from their chosen career path. Nor has increased expectation of women\u2019s work come with structural changes that would facilitate a more equal split. In many countries the parental leave and childcare systems force this dynamic further (to the detriment of men, women and children actually).\n\nI read a report on the BBC recently that was looking at people who are \u2018economically inactive\u2019 (so not unemployed and looking for work. It also wouldn\u2019t include the 9-12months of parental leave available in the UK as they would technically still be employed) in the 25-49 age group, 1.1 million people don\u2019t work due to caring responsibilities.

Stop providing **at all** that is.

Or do they sit on the couch playing video games all day whilst the baby cries and mum has her hands full cooking dinner, then take their anger, frustration and self esteem issues from losing the thing they think makes them a successful \u2018provider\u2019 out on the person they share a life with who is now taking sole responsibility for absolutely everything in the relationship. \n\nYour brother may have been dumped when he lost his job, but it probably wasn\u2019t only because he lost his job.

Their parents had wanted them to focus on school so they didn't have any chores. One person didn't know which was the washer and which was the dryer. She had seen them on TV but never used them.\n\nI also vividly remember a roommate who wanted to know what we (the two female roommates) were doing wrong with the kitchen floor because the it would get sticky sometimes. He was sure we were doing something wrong because his mom never mopped the floor. I told him she mopped when he was at school and said he could call his mom and ask if she had a mop.  He was suitably chastened."]}
