Curiously, there's no mention of cheating, abuse, neglect, depression, etc. He just lost a job and was being told he needed to find something from home. The maid issue should have been handled and dismissed as soon as the household income changed, but again, this just seems like something insignificant to throw your marriage away over when you're putting unrealistic work expectations on your partner. When he could have easily gotten a FT or PT job to supplement the income as he looked for remote work.
