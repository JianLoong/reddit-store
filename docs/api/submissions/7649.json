You funding more will not help her.", "Normally I\u2019d vote differently but given the circumstances and your synopsis of this guy NTA.\n\nTell her you\u2019ll save the money for her next wedding", "NTA\n\nPerhaps you should reach out to her with a compromise. If she and bf attend 10 marriage counseling sessions you'll put $$ towards wedding. If she has an impartial 3rd party guiding her through what marriage would be like with this guy, maybe she'll come to her senses.", "Reading the title I was sure ready to come out swinging but... you do in fact have a lot of legitimate concerns about the partner your youngest daughter has chosen, and as a father of two little girls myself I can easily understand where you're coming from. As fathers, we have our own ideas of what is best for our kids and naturally, we want them to have loving, supportive, coequal partners who will be able to carry their share of the responsibility of married life.   \n\n\nIf the unflattering portrait you paint of this guy is accurate, he is certainly not that. I would have deep reservations about my daughter marrying him as well. It sounds like she really just wants to be like her big sisters and is maybe rushing into things without having taken off the blinders that infatuation often puts over our eyes. When you're \"in love\" with someone it's hard to see their faults clearly. \n\nI think you could have been more diplomatic in how you phrased your answer to her, but I assume (uh oh) that you've at least told her some of the concerns you have about her partner. If not that's a conversation that needs to happen. At the end of the day, I wouldn't want my daughter to marry someone like the guy you describe either. \n\nNTA", "NTA and you\u2019re right to be concerned for your daughter, but please have a sit down conversation with her in which you express your love for her and that while you support her and she\u2019s always welcome in your life, you\u2019re concerned about this one specific major life decision because . . . and then fill in the blanks for her. She probably doesn\u2019t realize getting married means not only paying 100% of his life expenses but also handing over half her retirement + any messily assets she manages to build up while being the only one who works + paying for any secret debts he accrues while they\u2019re married + paying alimony + child support should they ever break up. \n\nOne exercise that could be helpful for her: what was her savings rate before he moved in and what is it now? Okay, so she\u2019s paying X% to keep her boyfriend. Making him her husband will make him cost 2*X%, assuming he doesn\u2019t start demanding lifestyle upgrades or take up new spending habits once they\u2019re married (which they usually do). Does she feel comfortable paying to keep some one in her life? He\u2019s not a SAHD and he\u2019s not even a housewife given that they live in filth, so what is she paying for exactly?", "Assuming that your older daughters' boyfriends also had to meet some minimum standard of approval before you paid for their weddings, NTA. You're not trying to dictate who your daughter marries, you're just not footing the bill for it. There's a big difference.", "NTA. But I\u2019d tell her the money will be available when they hit the 3 year mark.", "NTA.  Paying for your children\u2019s wedding isn\u2019t an obligation, it\u2019s your approval of the union and encouragement for their future.  I\u2019m glad you and your wife appear to be in sync on this.", "NTA. Put aside the wedding money and give it to her for the divorce, she'll need it more then", "Man.  Tough one indeed.  \n\nSticking with NTA  I, like you, think she's making a huge mistake.  Be there for her after the eventual divorce, but don't offer money while they are together.  Your daughter is choosing to play the game of life on the Hard Mode setting.  Nothing you can do about that except refuse to support it.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA on this one, because this guy sounds like a deadbeat.\n\nAt age 22, she\u2019s still pretty young. I know I certainly still had illusions about love conquering all when I was that age, and now I know love don\u2019t pay the bills.\n\nYour daughter probably sees \u201chis potential\u201d, but a man 8 years older than her at this stage in her life is already somewhat questionable, let alone one who can\u2019t hold down a job. I think you\u2019re making the right decision, op, but I also think you need to know this is going to (at least temporarily) damage your relationship with your daughter. I hope she comes around, and I would recommend to just continue being a loving and generally supportive parent (as in: supportive of healthy and good decisions).", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to your money. Spend it on what you want.", "NTA. It's not a requirement to pay for your kid's wedding. Ideally she'll come to her senses eventually, but admitting you made a bad choice in partners is never easy...until it's way too late.", "NTA. \n\nYou have some very legitimate concerns and she's acting like Ariel in the Little Mermaid with this whole \"Daddy I love him\" routine. \n\nThe only thing you can do here is iterate that you not spending money on the wedding is not because of a lack of love for her, but rather because of the concerns you have with them as a couple. Presumably you got to know your other daughters' partners well enough to feel like they respected your girls, that they would be equal partners and continue to foster a healthy relationship. The gift was to the couple, not your individual daughters.", "NTA - He is 8 years older and it seems like he wants to live off your daughter. I don't blame you for not wanting your daughter to marry a mooch. This doesn't sound like a partnership. \n\nI bet he's one of those guys that won't help do the daily duties because it's a 'women's job' \n\nI hope your daughter sees sense soon before she wastes more money on this guy.", "NTA\n\nI was not thinking I was going to vote this way but after all that you listed:\n\n1. He has poor hygiene\n2. struggling to pay bills\n3. unemployed\n4. they both live like slobs\n\nThis isn't about getting married, they want all the gifts and money that comes with it.", "NTA, but I hope she isn't someone that now has to 'prove' to you how committed she is once the parents disapprove.", "NTA. Normally I\u2019d vote the other way considering you paid for the other two siblings but considering your reasons are valid I\u2019m going for NTA. Maybe if she realizes this dude isn\u2019t the one and is more mature then you could pay for her next wedding if you have no concerns about her partner", "NTA he's definitely living off her.", "NTA. \n\nIt's your money. No one gets to dictate to you what you do with your money, that you worked hard for. The End. \n\nSecond, she sounds very immature. Her BF sounds very immature. And since they're not engaged (he hasn't asked her to marry him) I have the feeling she's the one pushing for marriage, not him. Which means, he probably doesn't want to get married anyway. Which makes the whole thing a non-starter. \n\nI have the feeling they will only be together as long as she supports him. He's using her. she'll keep pushing for marriage, he'll keep backing off, and then she'll catch him cheating or stealing from her or he'll find a more lucrative sugar mama. Time for you to sit back and watch the drama show. She'll survive the disappointment, and maybe it'll help her grow up", " NTA lol. your money your rules...", "Soft NTA.\n\nThe only reason I say soft is because you mentioned \u201cthey have no business getting married\u201d, when in fact, it\u2019s none of your business to decide that. After all, she is an adult.\n\nYou made it pretty clear that regardless of how you feel about her partner, they\u2019re free to elope- and I agree, if they want to be married, have kids, they should be free to do so. \n\nHowever, it is your money, and you decide what you do with it. Parents of a couple are not obligated to give money towards the wedding of a child. Having paid for your other daughters weddings does set an expectation, but you gave your reasoning. If she isn\u2019t satisfied, she can figure it out herself.", "This is a bit of a tough one.  I can understand why she thinks you should be paying for her wedding, but it really seems like you are just looking out for her so I'm going to say NTA.  I don't know that age is the issue.  Getting married young can work, I know that for a fact.  My parents married young and were happily married for 38 years when my mom passed away.  My husband and I married young and are now happily married almost 24 years.  I think the issue is more maturity and neither of these 2 sound terribly mature.  I can understand that from your daughter, but this man is 30, he should be a lot further along in life than it sounds like he is.", "NTA because your reasons to be opposed to a wedding are valid at this time, but what if in a year they are still together, still struggling financially and maturity wise, and then get engaged. Are you still going to refuse to support her choice and pay for the wedding as you have for your other children? The reality is you may not like the person she chooses to be with, and by refusing to accept that person you\u2019re also telling her you don\u2019t accept her for who she is. The way you talk about her is very negative and I find it hard to believe she doesn\u2019t pick up on what you think of her, if you don\u2019t change your view then don\u2019t be surprised when she decides you aren\u2019t someone she wants in her life.", "I'll go with NAH here. Other than you could have been more diplomatic about it. She's nine months into this guy and *in love*. That's not likely to last and you taking a hard stance that isn't going to be needed is unneeded. \"We'll talk about it when I see a ring\" is better for your relationship with daughter than \"Hell no, never\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My friend had a similar situation and did pay for the wedding, marriage lasted about 6 months. But it wasn't about her daughter's poor decision, it was about being fair and honoring her obligation to her daughter. You can do some pretty good damage by not being equal to kids if you read reddit, sometimes you've just got to sit back and watch the crash.

She being 5 years younger then the next sibling sounds like she was babied by you two.", "YTA but very soft. If your daughter was to tell this story from her perspective, most would think you are the AH as you never expressed any concerns about your other daughters' choices.\n\nIf you say no, you are likely damaging your relation with the daughter irrespective of whether you are right or wrong. You will also create a barrier for your daughter to come back if she ever feels unsafe in her relationship with bf/husband\n\nIt might be better to just ask her to delay the wedding by an year if she wants money from you.

He grew up to be a feminist and extremely well adjusted. If she turned out to be immature because the family indulged her, that's on you.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t back down\u2026\nLet\u2019s hope she wakes up soon and get\u2019s tired of this loser BEFORE she marries him.", "NTA.  $20K is a lot to throw away on a bad decision.

Sounds like her man needs to \"Man up\" and get and hold on to a job before they should be considering Marriage or Kids.

Hopefully, before any marriage.", "You are not the asshole. No one is required to pay for their children's wedding.", "NTA he sounds like my loser ex boyfriend. He might have mental health issues he needs help with, but from what you say, he's not in a place to be a good, reliable companion for your daughter.", "NTA, it sucks but at this point she has to make and live her own mistakes. Maybe it would make a difference if the family put on a united front, but \"interventions\" like you see on TV rarely work out in the short term.", "NTA. In this case it\u2019s more of protecting your daughter from a potential train wreck. You are not trying to stop her from getting married. You didn\u2019t try to control her. You just simply told her you would not be paying for the wedding or contributing to it. Is it unfair that you paid for her sisters weddings and not hers? \n\nWell\u2026that\u2019s a slippery slope. First off you\u2019re trying to protect her. And secondly it\u2019s your money to do with what you wish. Since a marriage isn\u2019t just about your daughter, but also about her future husband, it would stand to reason that you would want to like him enough to give them a $20K wedding gift as well. You don\u2019t care for him and he\u2019s not responsible enough to get married or be a responsible adult. So no, you\u2019re NTA. But, to be fair, if you\u2019re worried about favoritism, you could save the money you may have intended to give your youngest for a wedding gift to give to her at a later date when she needs it more. Like a down payment on a house, or her kids\u2019 college funds. Something else that would be more appropriate for her and not on the wedding. Heck you could even save it for her divorce costs if it comes down to that. They sound like they\u2019re not very mature or responsible or financially stable to be getting married. So that\u2019s a recipe for divorce. \n\nLet her elope. It\u2019s her choice to get married, she can pay for her own wedding, however it\u2019s funded and planned.", "Oof\n\nYou are in a tough spot because you contributed money to your other kid's weddings.  You don't want to seem like you are playing favorites, which I believe that isn't your intention.  The guy sounds like a loser.  I wouldn't want my kid in a relationship with them either, let alone get married.  She is young - only 22.  But the last thing you want to do is alienate her.  She needs a support system because that marriage isn't going to last.  I'm also concerned about her mental health. Was she always a slob or is this new behavior since the new boyfriend.\n\nI'm going to vote NTA based on context.", "I think your conversation with her about this should have been a lot different.  You should sit both of them down and set some clear expectations.  If you guys want me to pay for the wedding, here's some guidelines I have to make this work:\n1.  First... engagement.  let's see the ring?  Oh... we don't have one!  Let's figure that out and see how long we need to save up to get a ring.\n2.  Consistency on employment for a year or more.  \n3.  Pre-marital couples counseling... just throw this in here for added work so they can see compatibility \n\nJust coming out and saying NO sometimes can be harsh. Especially if after that, it's just all of your reasons for NO.  If it works, it works.  But also devising a plan can give them goals/a path to work towards.  PLUS, while doing this, they may see that marriage isn't for them.", "The real question is, why didn\u2019t you have this conversation with her from a different starting point?\n\nTell her all of your concerns, how you think she should wait for a while before marrying this person, and that you will pay for the wedding if she really wants to go through with it because you love her. But because you love her you\u2019re really afraid for her and the decisions she\u2019s making right now.\n\nKids tend to accept concerns and criticism when they\u2019re given out of love rather than as a dictation or ultimatum.\n\nNAH I guess because you\u2019re not really obligated to pay for anything, but I hope you find a better way to communicate with your daughter.", "NTA but you could also offer the daughter a compromise.  For every $1 she saves up the boyfriend must also contribute $1.  Then you also contribute $1.  This will at least make her feel like she isn't being rejected for her boyfriend.  And lets be honest, even if they did get some money together - how much will the two of them really save up?!?  Even if they each save a couple hundred dollars it won't harm you.  That token amount would at least save the relationship somewhat and when she realizes he is a loser she will still know you love her.", "[removed]", "I dont think you're an asshole but I'm going to suggest you go about this a little differently.

This dude ia going to suck your daughter dry.", "YTA.\n\nI get it, you know where this is going and doing what you think is right for your child but this is not your decision.  You don't get to choose her husband, her job, her career, or when and how many kids she has.  Those are her decisions.  If you paid for her sisters' weddings then you should pay for hers.  Not her second and third and fourth, but certainly her first.\n\nYou even admit:\n\n> she needs to understand that if she wants to make these kinds of adult decisions, then she will be treated like an adult\n\nbut you are not treating her like an adult, you are treating her like a child.\n\nWe (parents) have experience and wisdom that our children lack due solely to our having done things and made mistakes and watched others make mistakes.  We can share that wisdom with our children.  However, we do NOT know our children's world or all of the facts and circumstances surrounding it.  So it is for them to adapt and apply our advice to their situation.  And maybe they will make bad decisions despite this but they are their decisions and their lessons to learn.\n\nThat is not to say that it is easy to watch your child get hurt, physically, emotionally, mentally, or financially.  But sometimes it is the only way for them to learn important lessons.", "YTA, regardless of who she marries you are trying to pull a power play on your daughter, SHAME ON YOU!", "Not engaged but looking at venues \n\nBoth live like slobs, he\u2019s unemployed etc \n\nThat money isn\u2019t going to go toward a wedding \n\nNTA", "NTA - but there's more going on here. \n\nFirst: your daughter probably needs therapy, even it's just to help her sort out her thoughts. Maybe she has a neurodivergency? Regardless, the impulsivity of her actions means there's something going on that she desperately needs help with. \n\nSecond: the boyfriend sounds like a textbook Narcissist (of the actual, diagnosable Narcissistic Personality Disorder kind), and not supporting a relationship with him is the best thing you can do with your daughter. His behavior will NEVER get better from what you see... In fact it usually gets worse the longer you're exposed to him. \n\nThird: it sounds like there's tension between you and your daughter, and it has probably been there for a very long time. Whose fault is it? Doesn't matter, because it's there and needs to be worked through somehow. You want what's best for her, but she doesn't see it that way. Going together for counseling is a great step toward having a solid relationship.", "nta but dude, while i agree your daughter sounds immature and that this whole enchilada is a disaster, at the same time I would think you want to make sure she is safe and feels she can come to you with problems (such as maybe the lightbulb finally went on and she realizes her mistakes). By appearing critical of what she is doing and honestly cold, she may decide to not come to you for safety later.", "(Edit: ask her - if his mom is abusive, is she sure she wants to tie up her finances with her? This connects her legally not just to him, but to his parents. You could suggest that he go through the legal process to separate himself from his mother so she isn't considered someone who can make medical decisions if he's unconscious, inherit if he dies, etc. There's a good chance he won't do it. Which gives your daughter more to think about, and the connection itself give her reason to hesitate)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're not TA, but it's a bad idea. Deciding not to pay makes it easier for her to think of it as love/a relationship that's been treated unfairly. It will also seriously damage your relationship with her (because you paid for her sisters' weddings). Her eloping because of this, presumably without you there, also sends the message that you aren't there for her if you don't approve of her decisions. If/when she realizes that this guy is terrible, she's less likely to get out of the marriage because she'll have less of the emotional and financial support network she'd need (you may think 'of course I'd be there for her if she left him' but she's told you herself: she sees this as you not loving her as much as her sisters).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are you hoping to do by withholding the money? She already knows you don't approve. The only thing this does is turn the situation into something more adversarial. Instead of a parent whose words she should consider, even if she doesn't follow the advice right now, you're the 'bad guy.' It would be worth being the bad guy if it protected her, but this doesn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: A better approach: you and her disagree about the guy, and that won't change via argument. So change the focus. Tell her you'll pay, but talk about how good of an idea it is to marry a bit later. Try to find practical reasons that aren't related to the relationship being awful. Does she know his family well? This would legally tie her to them. If she and her husband are both in an accident, could there be a situation where his family, now her family, have power over her medical care (if for some reason you're not available - maybe you got in the accident too or maybe you're in another country or camping somewhere without service)? Does she want his family trying to claim her assets if something happens to her?\n\nYou could also suggest things that would let her find out the truth for herself. 'I know we don't agree on him. How about he babysits some kids? That way you can know for yourself whether or not he'll care for them.'\n\nYou could also think of ways to help her get the 'grown up' feeling she wants. It could even merge with this. Learning things about budgeting and how to look over all expenses shows how little he contributes and how much he spends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf possible, you can tell her that you'll pay, but it would wipe out all the savings you have liquid (everything else being in a retirement fund that'll be taxed to hell if you take it out early) and would prefer another 6 months of time to get it together.\n\nIf you think it would work, you could say you're concerned about the speed of marriage. But that could cause another argument.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes she want to be a housewife? He'll need to get a job then. Talk to her about it in terms of the future she wants, not the one you want for her. What are her specific goals and whether or not he fits into them.", "YTA - not that I necessarily disagree but you have to be prepared that what you see as 'doing the right thing' is essentially putting terms & conditions on one daughter's wedding that you didn't on the other two ... and setting up a situation that might end with a broken relationship with the one daughter.  \n\nAlso, you talk about her immaturity and desire to grow up ... and that type of thing almost always reflects back onto the parents and how they treated the children. So before dumping on her, perhaps a little introspection is in order.", "YTA. You can do whatever you want with your money, but by saying what you did, you only pushed her closer to the boyfriend. You could have had an adult conversation with her where you asked her about how this relationship makes her feel, and sincerely expressed your worries and what you are seeing from your side. You can still fix this, but you need to apologize.", "Yeah. She is 22 and taking care of an unemployed 30 year old that she only met 9 months ago.... Hopefully, she will come to her senses.\n\nIf I were OP and the rest of her family I wouldn't fight her on it - just be firm with not providing support. Once she realizes that she isn't getting the attention or feedback that she probably craves in the leadup to a wedding, nor is anyone actively trying to fight her decision, she may lose interest in this guy.

I'd avoid conjecture.\n\nI would also preface the conversation with something along the lines of \"I'm bringing this up because I love you and I want the best for you, and this will be the only time that I bring it up. I don't want you to think that this is a negative against you in any way just that I am seeing some things that concern me for a long-term relationship and I wanted to talk to you about what those are and why.

On top of that I didn't know what were red flags and why they were because I was relatively young and naive. I wish I had known what to look for back then it would have saved me so much. \n\nAnd then at the end, hopefully she stayed long enough to listen, I would say something like \"you are my daughter and I love you no matter what. I think you deserve to have the absolute best in the world, be it your prince charming and a castle or living on your own driving race cars (or whatever) and I don't want you to settle for less or have less because you feel like you don't deserve it.

He's really respectful and kind of not the best listener, not very a very good communicator (much like his father). He has two siblings he grew up with and a half brother that's about 15 years older than him. His half brother was kicked out of the house, around the time parker would have been in elementary school for being gay.(again his father is def an AH) Sounds like there's an obvious \"least favorite child\" right? \nFast forward to us dating. We live in an urban environment, not like New York but a pretty big city with a lot of people in it. He was going to college while renting in the city and he walked everywhere. I don't drive because of anxiety so I'm used to it, but he clearly was not always talking about how he wishes he could just drive around and how inconvenient everything is to get to. I asked him how he felt about saving up for a car and he told me he technically already had one. His younger brother lived just outside of the city and they were supposed to share the car that stayed at his brothers house. \"Sharing\" would go something like this. Parker says I need the car to go somewhere, his brother says no, end of attempt to share. OR Parker asks for the car, his brother says sure but you have to come get it. Parker takes two buses and a two hour walk to get to the car and has to take buses to get home after. \nThe car is eventually given to the younger brother, not strings attached and without asking/telling Parker at all except what his brother tells him. \nAs if this story isn't long enough fast forward some more and Parker and I are staying with his parents as the apartment we moved into was unlivable and we need to move in a rush. Upon moving in and talking to his mother we find out that not only did his younger brother get a car, so did his younger sister and his eldest half brother even though he was kicked out of the house. \nHis father explained this as him just not having the money to get a car for Parker since everyone else already had a car. The explanation made sense but it did nothing for how Parker feels. He's always felt like the least favorite, and the one everyone forgets and this set that in stone. He was the only one to not get something, and at the time got no explanation for what he did to be singled out. \nIn addition his dad \"threatened\" to help him buy a car or a scooter for his birthday and got him a frame for his diploma instead so, that probably didn't help.\n\nTl;Dr: why you may be right that she shouldn't be getting married it doesn't change that you are singling out one child and treating them differently from the others.

Plus usually divorce attorneys draft these so she would already have a go to attorney to work with if it comes to that.", "My bad when you said \u201cand that dad wasn\u2019t gonna bail you out \u201c I read it as as \u201c dad will not be bailing you out either, so don\u2019t go running to him\u201d Good dad*", "Then I am gonna vote NTA\n\nBut still try to not blur the lines between raising your daughter awareness and choosing their partner for them", "I also want to add that I have a young daughter and I can't imagine what it's like as a mom, doing the best you can, seeing her make choices that are hurting her. Seriously, good on you for standing up against the marriage she wants, because marrying him is going to hurt her so much.", "Oh that's rough. I hope she utilizes it more, or can find a better fit.", "Except he wasn't a child anymore, but a fully grown adult for one and sometimesthe truth hurts, but it's still the truth. Second, you totally just projected a bunch of shit no one even said, bro. Sorry you have parent issues. That's a you problem, though.", "Handing over the money wouldn't improve things, either.  It would be forgotten as soon as the next thing that had her acting demanding came up.  It's all too common with people like her and her leech.", "Good/bridal magazine style/princess wedding wish venues are booked.  Traditional venues are booked. \n\nNontraditional venues aren\u2019t.  Mine has 3 wedding receptions booked for June/July and we could do them every evening of each weekend or weekday if people wanted.  Rentals are a small sideline, not our focus.", "I absolutely agree.", "I have arranged for both, and have put her in contact with our insurance coordinator to help her change therepists. She has been to a psychiatrist, but only went once and never went back.", "Makes sense.", "I'm her dad.", "Exactly!\n\nOP, you've said that you and your wife have \"touched on\" your concerns about this relationship a couple of times with your daughter. It's time for a more serious, heartfelt conversation.\n\nYes, your daughter is an adult. Yes, she will have to deal with whatever consequences result from continuing to be involved with this man, especially if they get married. But here's the thing: your disapproval won't lessen the blow if the shit hits the fan. \n\nRight now, this guy is telling your daughter whatever she wants to hear, \"worshipping the ground she walks on.\" Right now, he's a balm for her self-esteem, so she can accept his flaws and believe his excuses. But this dynamic isn't sustainable. It won't last forever. Now, maybe they'll figure out how to help each other heal and grow and their relationship will thrive. Or maybe the relationship will burn out before they get married and have kids. Your daughter will be in pain, but at least she won't be legally bound to him. \n\nThere's no way to know for sure how this is going to go. But chances are that your daughter will fare better knowing that you and your wife are in her corner consistently. Sparkie_5000's comment above has wonderful examples of how phrase (and finance) that support.", "Not *a* child, *their* child.\n\nAnd not projection, common sense logic.", "Maybe tell her only after they've lived together, on their own financially, for 2 years - and engaged, lol.  Then you'll talk budget.\n\nEDIT:  NTA.", "She almost certainly abused him as a child. Probably emotionally, but that's worse in some ways.", "Because she's not feeding and cleaning up after him, no doubt.", "As someone who made a \"young & dumb\" relationship mistake, there are 2 things I can tell you:\n1. The more you disapprove, the longer the relationship will last. \n2. The more you financially support her, the longer it will last.\nI had hover parents, was not taught consequences, & was a bit spoiled. Man Mistake reduced the hovering so my newfound freedom hid his flaws. Money from the parents also hid his flaws. Absolutely, cut her off financially, and tell her you love her and that you know she'll became a successful adult.", "So sorry! Then let me change it to \"as a parent\"", "Naw bro, projection & your lack of life experience.", "This was my presumption.\n\nIf OP said \"oh your budget is $20k\"\n\nDaughter would be like - \"well what if we only spent $10K, can we have the rest now to buy a car/pay our rent/whatever\"", "Yeah my lack of life experience is why I think people should be kind, and that parents should make sure their child knows they have a strong support system if said child is dating someone the parents don't like.\n\nI'm clearly not thinking straight and letting emotion cloud my view.", "This is very similar to what I did. I am a bigger woman, and was always desperate for love. Dated someone online for months, never meant them, but was looking into uprooting my life to go to college across the country just to be with them. Realized it was unhealthy, and ended that. Met a guy, moved in with him, got engaged after 3 weeks, the whole nine yards. My parents asked me to wait to marry him until I graduated college. I was fortunate in that he dumped me and broke my heart, but saved me from a life of misery. Him leaving me was the best thing to happen to me. Long story short, just let her know that you will always love her and be there for her. If she has a goal she wants to reach (graduate college, get a certain level of pay, etc) encourage her to wait until that is met. If you tell her its because you don't like the guy, she will stay stubborn and stay with him to prove you wrong. If you tell her its so she can reach her goals in life, its much easier without kids, and being married really isn't any different than dating when you live together, she may just listen. Try to give her options or find a gray zone instead of the black and white that you two are at right now. Anything to give her some time to mature and realize that she deserves better. Also if/when she gets her heart broken again, give her a membership to eharmony or something similar. It matched me with my husband based on personality, and there was less focus on appearance than other dating sites and apps. It boosted my confidence whenever I was matched with someone, but there wasn't the pressure to become more physical before getting to know them that can be found with some other dating apps. (This is all personal experience, your mileage will vary. I just really identify with OP's daughter as it sounds so much like my life, I wanted to give my advice and story.)", "I do feel terrible for her though, she needs an intervention.", "Would you cover her therapy? Life goals? That maybe a better way to support her\u2026not the marriage. I\u2019d see it as giving them what they need, not necessarily what they want. She would shit on it now but leave it as a standing offer if you can find a gentle way of delivering it\u2026don\u2019t hinge it on if she got married. Just the money goes to her therapy, education or whatever\u2026make sure she\u2019s supported even if she cuts you off.\n\nOr straight up say you\u2019ll match her boyfriends direct contribution\u2026no one else can pay it. I\u2019m sure your other son in laws covered something equatable.", "Daughter is going to learn a hard lesson after they are married and have kids unless he shapes up. NTA", "I was a mess in my 20s.  Non existent self esteem from a lifetime of being bullied and no belief anyone could love me. In my case it translated into not trusting anyone. Safer but lonely.  I focused my energy on school and career. And started the long road to fixing me.\n\nBy the time I met DH I was in my mid 30s.  I had my life together. Had friends I trusted and hobbies I enjoy. Had built up a decent amount of self esteem, finished my master's degree and established my career.  I tease him he wasn't supposed to be Mr Right, he was supposed to be Mr-you'll-do-for-right-now (lol).  We've been together close to 25 years and he still tells me I'm beautiful and that he loves me.  Does nice things just because. He can drive me crazy, and I have given up hope of his socks making it into the laundry basket, but he is a genuinely good person that I love and respect.\n\nThe happier you are with yourself, the better people you attract.  Users can pick out the desperate ones every time.  I hope OPs daughter learns this before she does anything to tie herself to this looser permanently.", "I have a friend in the same boat. I love her to pieces, but she\u2019s engaged to a guy who frankly provides nothing. He hasn\u2019t had a job in years, does the occasional household chore but not the bulk, and spends all his time gaming. I keep thinking it would be one thing if he had any excuse for not doing anything, if he was disabled or going back to school to finish his degree or working on a novel or even streaming on Twitch. Nope. \n\nI\u2019ve just about given up that she\u2019ll see reason. It\u2019s a weird frustrating situation to be in, having someone close to you who is spending so much of their energy on someone who really doesn\u2019t deserve it.", "True, but it at least buys a few years for his daughter to work on herself in therapy and learn some important life lessons, without immediately alienating her.", "Oh. My. Gosh. I think you just changed my life.", "My family member did that.  He met his girlfriend online through mutual in person friends who thought they\u2019d like each other.\n\nOf course the kids thing was while they were dating online across oceans and continents in a very hypothetical \u201chey, I like you a lot.  If you ever got married would you want to have kids?  Or are kids something you Don\u2019t want or think you might want later?\u201d kind of way.  Like every other major relationship issue from if they\u2019d ever leave their home country to what their family relationships were like.\n\nThen they spent three years or so with alternating long working visas to each others countries and eventually got engaged and married and picked a home country.\n\nThree months online as a serious option when you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re being catfished is nuts.", "u/ThrowRA18348, I wanted to highlight the above comment for you in case you missed it. This is someone who has been where your daughter is, and I think that's really important. \n\nu/kirathegeek sounds like she's been in a *very* similar situation to your daughter - and she made it through. I think her comment gives a lot of insight into how your daughter might be thinking, and why she might be reacting the way she is. If you are thinking about how you might support your daughter or help her - especially in ways that *aren't* financial - please do read the above comment. \n\nkirathegeek, thank you for sharing your experiences.", "This is a great idea.", "Nooooooo.... This is a terrible idea. Financial support of any kind will hide his flaws.", "She has a therapist,  my insurance covers it. I was paying for her school until she quit because it was too much since she took on a second job to pay bills.", "I'm so sorry you witnessed that and sorry for the loss of your friend. That's truly awful. Have you looked into therapy as an adult? It might be helpful if you're struggling from that loss and what you witnessed, and it would be good to work on being able to get behind the wheel. Knowing how to drive is important, even if you don't need to drive right now. You never know where life will take you and might find yourself in a place where you need to be able to drive. I had (and still have to some extent) a lot of anxiety and fear about driving. I never witnessed anything like you did, but still am very afraid of hitting someone and injuring them (or worse). I didn't get my license until my early 20s so I can relate a tiny bit to your situation. It sucks, and I would prefer to never drive if it were feasible. I used to live somewhere that I could walk or take public transit, but now I live in an area where a car is required to get around. Along with therapy, I hired a very nice, patient driving instructor who had experience working with people who have driving-related anxiety. That really helped me a lot and might be something you could look into if you ever decide to try to learn to drive in the future.", "Calamityware.
