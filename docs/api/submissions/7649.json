You funding more will not help her.", "Normally I\u2019d vote differently but given the circumstances and your synopsis of this guy NTA.\n\nTell her you\u2019ll save the money for her next wedding", "NTA\n\nPerhaps you should reach out to her with a compromise. If she and bf attend 10 marriage counseling sessions you'll put $$ towards wedding. If she has an impartial 3rd party guiding her through what marriage would be like with this guy, maybe she'll come to her senses.", "Reading the title I was sure ready to come out swinging but... you do in fact have a lot of legitimate concerns about the partner your youngest daughter has chosen, and as a father of two little girls myself I can easily understand where you're coming from. As fathers, we have our own ideas of what is best for our kids and naturally, we want them to have loving, supportive, coequal partners who will be able to carry their share of the responsibility of married life.   \n\n\nIf the unflattering portrait you paint of this guy is accurate, he is certainly not that. I would have deep reservations about my daughter marrying him as well. It sounds like she really just wants to be like her big sisters and is maybe rushing into things without having taken off the blinders that infatuation often puts over our eyes. When you're \"in love\" with someone it's hard to see their faults clearly. \n\nI think you could have been more diplomatic in how you phrased your answer to her, but I assume (uh oh) that you've at least told her some of the concerns you have about her partner. If not that's a conversation that needs to happen. At the end of the day, I wouldn't want my daughter to marry someone like the guy you describe either. \n\nNTA", "NTA and you\u2019re right to be concerned for your daughter, but please have a sit down conversation with her in which you express your love for her and that while you support her and she\u2019s always welcome in your life, you\u2019re concerned about this one specific major life decision because . . . and then fill in the blanks for her. She probably doesn\u2019t realize getting married means not only paying 100% of his life expenses but also handing over half her retirement + any messily assets she manages to build up while being the only one who works + paying for any secret debts he accrues while they\u2019re married + paying alimony + child support should they ever break up. \n\nOne exercise that could be helpful for her: what was her savings rate before he moved in and what is it now? Okay, so she\u2019s paying X% to keep her boyfriend. Making him her husband will make him cost 2*X%, assuming he doesn\u2019t start demanding lifestyle upgrades or take up new spending habits once they\u2019re married (which they usually do). Does she feel comfortable paying to keep some one in her life? He\u2019s not a SAHD and he\u2019s not even a housewife given that they live in filth, so what is she paying for exactly?", "Assuming that your older daughters' boyfriends also had to meet some minimum standard of approval before you paid for their weddings, NTA. You're not trying to dictate who your daughter marries, you're just not footing the bill for it. There's a big difference.", "NTA. But I\u2019d tell her the money will be available when they hit the 3 year mark.", "NTA.  Paying for your children\u2019s wedding isn\u2019t an obligation, it\u2019s your approval of the union and encouragement for their future.  I\u2019m glad you and your wife appear to be in sync on this.", "NTA. Put aside the wedding money and give it to her for the divorce, she'll need it more then", "Man.  Tough one indeed.  \n\nSticking with NTA  I, like you, think she's making a huge mistake.  Be there for her after the eventual divorce, but don't offer money while they are together.  Your daughter is choosing to play the game of life on the Hard Mode setting.  Nothing you can do about that except refuse to support it.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA on this one, because this guy sounds like a deadbeat.\n\nAt age 22, she\u2019s still pretty young. I know I certainly still had illusions about love conquering all when I was that age, and now I know love don\u2019t pay the bills.\n\nYour daughter probably sees \u201chis potential\u201d, but a man 8 years older than her at this stage in her life is already somewhat questionable, let alone one who can\u2019t hold down a job. I think you\u2019re making the right decision, op, but I also think you need to know this is going to (at least temporarily) damage your relationship with your daughter. I hope she comes around, and I would recommend to just continue being a loving and generally supportive parent (as in: supportive of healthy and good decisions).", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to your money. Spend it on what you want.", "NTA. It's not a requirement to pay for your kid's wedding. Ideally she'll come to her senses eventually, but admitting you made a bad choice in partners is ever easy...until it's way too late.", "NTA. \n\nYou have some very legitimate concerns and she's acting like Ariel in the Little Mermaid with this whole \"Daddy I love him\" routine. \n\nThe only thing you can do here is iterate that you not spending money on the wedding is not because of a lack of love for her, but rather because of the concerns you have with them as a couple. Presumably you got to know your other daughters' partners well enough to feel like they respected your girls, that they would be equal partners and continue to foster a healthy relationship. The gift was to the couple, not your individual daughters.", "NTA - He is 8 years older and it seems like he wants to live off your daughter. I don't blame you for not wanting your daughter to marry a mooch. This doesn't sound like a partnership. \n\nI bet he's one of those guys that won't help do the daily duties because it's a 'women's job' \n\nI hope your daughter sees sense soon before she wastes more money on this guy.", "NTA\n\nI was not thinking I was going to vote this way but after all that you listed:\n\n1. He has poor hygiene\n2. struggling to pay bills\n3. unemployed\n4. they both live like slobs\n\nThis isn't about getting married, they want all the gifts and money that comes with it.", "NTA, but I hope she isn't someone that now has to 'prove' to you how committed she is once the parents disapprove.", "NTA. Normally I\u2019d vote the other way considering you paid for the other two siblings but considering your reasons are valid I\u2019m going for NTA. Maybe if she realizes this dude isn\u2019t the one and is more mature then you could pay for her next wedding if you have no concerns about her partner", "NTA he's definitely living off her.", "NTA. \n\nIt's your money. No one gets to dictate to you what you do with your money, that you worked hard for. The End. \n\nSecond, she sounds very immature. Her BF sounds very immature. And since they're not engaged (he hasn't asked her to marry him) I have the feeling she's the one pushing for marriage, not him. Which means, he probably doesn't want to get married anyway. Which makes the whole thing a non-starter. \n\nI have the feeling they will only be together as long as she supports him. He's using her. she'll keep pushing for marriage, he'll keep backing off, and then she'll catch him cheating or stealing from her or he'll find a more lucrative sugar mama. Time for you to sit back and watch the drama show. She'll survive the disappointment, and maybe it'll help her grow up", " NTA lol. your money your rules...", "Soft NTA.\n\nThe only reason I say soft is because you mentioned \u201cthey have no business getting married\u201d, when in fact, it\u2019s none of your business to decide that. After all, she is an adult.\n\nYou made it pretty clear that regardless of how you feel about her partner, they\u2019re free to elope- and I agree, if they want to be married, have kids, they should be free to do so. \n\nHowever, it is your money, and you decide what you do with it. Parents of a couple are not obligated to give money towards the wedding of a child. Having paid for your other daughters weddings does set an expectation, but you gave your reasoning. If she isn\u2019t satisfied, she can figure it out herself.", "This is a bit of a tough one.  I can understand why she thinks you should be paying for her wedding, but it really seems like you are just looking out for her so I'm going to say NTA.  I don't know that age is the issue.  Getting married young can work, I know that for a fact.  My parents married young and were happily married for 38 years when my mom passed away.  My husband and I married young and are now happily married almost 24 years.  I think the issue is more maturity and neither of these 2 sound terribly mature.  I can understand that from your daughter, but this man is 30, he should be a lot further along in life than it sounds like he is.", "NTA because your reasons to be opposed to a wedding are valid at this time, but what if in a year they are still together, still struggling financially and maturity wise, and then get engaged. Are you still going to refuse to support her choice and pay for the wedding as you have for your other children? The reality is you may not like the person she chooses to be with, and by refusing to accept that person you\u2019re also telling her you don\u2019t accept her for who she is. The way you talk about her is very negative and I find it hard to believe she doesn\u2019t pick up on what you think of her, if you don\u2019t change your view then don\u2019t be surprised when she decides you aren\u2019t someone she wants in her life.", "I'll go with NAH here. Other than you could have been more diplomatic about it. She's nine months into this guy and *in love*. That's not likely to last and you taking a hard stance that isn't going to be needed is unneeded. \"We'll talk about it when I see a ring\" is better for your relationship with daughter than \"Hell no, never\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My friend had a similar situation and did pay for the wedding, marriage lasted about 6 months. But it wasn't about her daughter's poor decision, it was about being fair and honoring her obligation to her daughter. You can do some pretty good damage by not being equal to kids if you read reddit, sometimes you've just got to sit back and watch the crash.

She being 5 years younger then the next sibling sounds like she was babied by you two.", "YTA but very soft. If your daughter was to tell this story from her perspective, most would think you are the AH as you never expressed any concerns about your other daughters' choices.\n\nIf you say no, you are likely damaging your relation with the daughter irrespective of whether you are right or wrong. You will also create a barrier for your daughter to come back if she ever feels unsafe in her relationship with bf/husband\n\nIt might be better to just ask her to delay the wedding by an year if she wants money from you.

I think it\u2019s a lot better to stop this now then later on when they have kids already and the guy is unable to maintain a job unless the daughter is able to cover everything money wise will be does the child care.", "There's going NC to remove oneself from toxic and harmful relationships, but there are also those who stonewall or go NC to emotionally punish/blackmail those who don't give them what they want.

Not everyone \"cuts off family \"", "Oh yeah, it\u2019d go down like a lead balloon but I doubt anything other than giving her the money would improve things at the moment.\n\nThe thing is, you know without a doubt that this guy is a bum, she\u2019ll either figure that out and leave or she\u2019ll stay to prove everyone wrong.

Good luck.", "Make sure if she goes through with it to get a prenup.", "While I don't disagree with you, I think a softer approach might be wiser in the long run. The harder you put your foot down the more she'll fight you and defend him. If you tell him you hate the guy and that he's a useless leech (not untrue), she's going to insist he's great and the love of her life and she WILL marry him (if only just to spite you).\n\nIt might be better to be... not necessarily supportive but... non-committal? Tell her you love her and want her to be happy and that you'll always be there for her but stop short of agreeing that he's a great guy, praising her decision to financially support him, and opening your wallet.\n\nIf she asks for money for the wedding, tell her you'll talk about it once things get more solidified (like a ring, a proposal, an announcement, etc.). Then instead of being judgmental, ask questions. Did he get you a ring? Why are you paying for your own ring? Are you guys going to buy a house? The housing market is tough! How much is a 20% down payment for a decent house nowadays? Wow! Catering is definitely costly! Are you happy if you can only afford to invite 50 people?\n\nTry to get the wheels turning in her head about how little he's contributing and what kind of sacrifices she's going to have to make if she marries a deadbeat. You don't have to pay for this wedding (obviously) but I'd rethink your approach since badmouthing him will only alienate your daughter even more. NTA", "She sounds like my SIL.

And as my parents did that once you are engaged we will talk about planning but are not comfortable giving her a number.   \n\nI have no idea how much my siblings weddings cost.     My dad did not like my (now ex) either but never really expressed it to me-  I wish he did however I also would have not reacted well if he did what you did.\n\nShe is \u201cin love\u201d pushing her is going to ruin your relationship and she will feel uncomfortable coming to you if she wants to leave or needs advice about him.\n\nEdit: Also it is your money so your budget for her could be 100 dollars and she will have to accept that but until she is engaged and formally looking at venues on her own I would not - engage right now with finances at all.", "OP's plan will backfire. It will push her closer to the guy and the need to prove it will work. And she will not feel like she can come to OP when she's in trouble.\n\nIf OP calmly told her that they think she is settling or other concerns (in a very objective but still supportive way) and treated her equally with her sisters ($20k for wedding), then OP would likely end up having greater influence and possibly make the daughter think twice.", "Maybe make a deal with her that if her boyfriend can hold down a reputable job for a couple of years, helps out around the house and contributes financially to the household as you won't be able too as you've got to save for the wedding. \n\nOf course the wedding be in a few years time if the bf can actually hold down a job. If it's true love then they'll still be together at the end.", "Is there a spoken expectation that you help pay for the wedding AND support them financially afterwards? You are between a rock and a hard place for sure. I like the idea of just saying you\u2019ll only ever pay for ONE wedding though\n\nCould you stipulate a timeframe for them to be together before you will chip in for the wedding?

She is just thrilled they have found eachother, and I'm pretty sure that is because she got him out of her house. \n\nShe loves him to pieces. Only child.

She is an adult and should be able to make her own romantic choices, but it's not unfair to tie a substantial monetary gift to a demonstration that she can support herself going forward."]}
