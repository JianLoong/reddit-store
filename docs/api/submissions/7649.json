You funding more will not help her.", "Normally I\u2019d vote differently but given the circumstances and your synopsis of this guy NTA.\n\nTell her you\u2019ll save the money for her next wedding", "NTA\n\nPerhaps you should reach out to her with a compromise. If she and bf attend 10 marriage counseling sessions you'll put $$ towards wedding. If she has an impartial 3rd party guiding her through what marriage would be like with this guy, maybe she'll come to her senses.", "Reading the title I was sure ready to come out swinging but... you do in fact have a lot of legitimate concerns about the partner your youngest daughter has chosen, and as a father of two little girls myself I can easily understand where you're coming from. As fathers, we have our own ideas of what is best for our kids and naturally, we want them to have loving, supportive, coequal partners who will be able to carry their share of the responsibility of married life.   \n\n\nIf the unflattering portrait you paint of this guy is accurate, he is certainly not that. I would have deep reservations about my daughter marrying him as well. It sounds like she really just wants to be like her big sisters and is maybe rushing into things without having taken off the blinders that infatuation often puts over our eyes. When you're \"in love\" with someone it's hard to see their faults clearly. \n\nI think you could have been more diplomatic in how you phrased your answer to her, but I assume (uh oh) that you've at least told her some of the concerns you have about her partner. If not that's a conversation that needs to happen. At the end of the day, I wouldn't want my daughter to marry someone like the guy you describe either. \n\nNTA", "NTA and you\u2019re right to be concerned for your daughter, but please have a sit down conversation with her in which you express your love for her and that while you support her and she\u2019s always welcome in your life, you\u2019re concerned about this one specific major life decision because . . . and then fill in the blanks for her. She probably doesn\u2019t realize getting married means not only paying 100% of his life expenses but also handing over half her retirement + any messily assets she manages to build up while being the only one who works + paying for any secret debts he accrues while they\u2019re married + paying alimony + child support should they ever break up. \n\nOne exercise that could be helpful for her: what was her savings rate before he moved in and what is it now? Okay, so she\u2019s paying X% to keep her boyfriend. Making him her husband will make him cost 2*X%, assuming he doesn\u2019t start demanding lifestyle upgrades or take up new spending habits once they\u2019re married (which they usually do). Does she feel comfortable paying to keep some one in her life? He\u2019s not a SAHD and he\u2019s not even a housewife given that they live in filth, so what is she paying for exactly?", "Assuming that your older daughters' boyfriends also had to meet some minimum standard of approval before you paid for their weddings, NTA. You're not trying to dictate who your daughter marries, you're just not footing the bill for it. There's a big difference.", "NTA. But I\u2019d tell her the money will be available when they hit the 3 year mark.", "NTA.  Paying for your children\u2019s wedding isn\u2019t an obligation, it\u2019s your approval of the union and encouragement for their future.  I\u2019m glad you and your wife appear to be in sync on this.", "NTA. Put aside the wedding money and give it to her for the divorce, she'll need it more then", "Man.  Tough one indeed.  \n\nSticking with NTA  I, like you, think she's making a huge mistake.  Be there for her after the eventual divorce, but don't offer money while they are together.  Your daughter is choosing to play the game of life on the Hard Mode setting.  Nothing you can do about that except refuse to support it.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA on this one, because this guy sounds like a deadbeat.\n\nAt age 22, she\u2019s still pretty young. I know I certainly still had illusions about love conquering all when I was that age, and now I know love don\u2019t pay the bills.\n\nYour daughter probably sees \u201chis potential\u201d, but a man 8 years older than her at this stage in her life is already somewhat questionable, let alone one who can\u2019t hold down a job. I think you\u2019re making the right decision, op, but I also think you need to know this is going to (at least temporarily) damage your relationship with your daughter. I hope she comes around, and I would recommend to just continue being a loving and generally supportive parent (as in: supportive of healthy and good decisions).", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to your money. Spend it on what you want.", "NTA. It's not a requirement to pay for your kid's wedding. Ideally she'll come to her senses eventually, but admitting you made a bad choice in partners is ever easy...until it's way too late.", "NTA. \n\nYou have some very legitimate concerns and she's acting like Ariel in the Little Mermaid with this whole \"Daddy I love him\" routine. \n\nThe only thing you can do here is iterate that you not spending money on the wedding is not because of a lack of love for her, but rather because of the concerns you have with them as a couple. Presumably you got to know your other daughters' partners well enough to feel like they respected your girls, that they would be equal partners and continue to foster a healthy relationship. The gift was to the couple, not your individual daughters.", "NTA - He is 8 years older and it seems like he wants to live off your daughter. I don't blame you for not wanting your daughter to marry a mooch. This doesn't sound like a partnership. \n\nI bet he's one of those guys that won't help do the daily duties because it's a 'women's job' \n\nI hope your daughter sees sense soon before she wastes more money on this guy.", "NTA\n\nI was not thinking I was going to vote this way but after all that you listed:\n\n1. He has poor hygiene\n2. struggling to pay bills\n3. unemployed\n4. they both live like slobs\n\nThis isn't about getting married, they want all the gifts and money that comes with it.", "NTA, but I hope she isn't someone that now has to 'prove' to you how committed she is once the parents disapprove.", "NTA. Normally I\u2019d vote the other way considering you paid for the other two siblings but considering your reasons are valid I\u2019m going for NTA. Maybe if she realizes this dude isn\u2019t the one and is more mature then you could pay for her next wedding if you have no concerns about her partner", "NTA he's definitely living off her.", "NTA. \n\nIt's your money. No one gets to dictate to you what you do with your money, that you worked hard for. The End. \n\nSecond, she sounds very immature. Her BF sounds very immature. And since they're not engaged (he hasn't asked her to marry him) I have the feeling she's the one pushing for marriage, not him. Which means, he probably doesn't want to get married anyway. Which makes the whole thing a non-starter. \n\nI have the feeling they will only be together as long as she supports him. He's using her. she'll keep pushing for marriage, he'll keep backing off, and then she'll catch him cheating or stealing from her or he'll find a more lucrative sugar mama. Time for you to sit back and watch the drama show. She'll survive the disappointment, and maybe it'll help her grow up", " NTA lol. your money your rules...", "Soft NTA.\n\nThe only reason I say soft is because you mentioned \u201cthey have no business getting married\u201d, when in fact, it\u2019s none of your business to decide that. After all, she is an adult.\n\nYou made it pretty clear that regardless of how you feel about her partner, they\u2019re free to elope- and I agree, if they want to be married, have kids, they should be free to do so. \n\nHowever, it is your money, and you decide what you do with it. Parents of a couple are not obligated to give money towards the wedding of a child. Having paid for your other daughters weddings does set an expectation, but you gave your reasoning. If she isn\u2019t satisfied, she can figure it out herself.", "This is a bit of a tough one.  I can understand why she thinks you should be paying for her wedding, but it really seems like you are just looking out for her so I'm going to say NTA.  I don't know that age is the issue.  Getting married young can work, I know that for a fact.  My parents married young and were happily married for 38 years when my mom passed away.  My husband and I married young and are now happily married almost 24 years.  I think the issue is more maturity and neither of these 2 sound terribly mature.  I can understand that from your daughter, but this man is 30, he should be a lot further along in life than it sounds like he is.", "NTA because your reasons to be opposed to a wedding are valid at this time, but what if in a year they are still together, still struggling financially and maturity wise, and then get engaged. Are you still going to refuse to support her choice and pay for the wedding as you have for your other children? The reality is you may not like the person she chooses to be with, and by refusing to accept that person you\u2019re also telling her you don\u2019t accept her for who she is. The way you talk about her is very negative and I find it hard to believe she doesn\u2019t pick up on what you think of her, if you don\u2019t change your view then don\u2019t be surprised when she decides you aren\u2019t someone she wants in her life.", "I'll go with NAH here. Other than you could have been more diplomatic about it. She's nine months into this guy and *in love*. That's not likely to last and you taking a hard stance that isn't going to be needed is unneeded. \"We'll talk about it when I see a ring\" is better for your relationship with daughter than \"Hell no, never\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My friend had a similar situation and did pay for the wedding, marriage lasted about 6 months. But it wasn't about her daughter's poor decision, it was about being fair and honoring her obligation to her daughter. You can do some pretty good damage by not being equal to kids if you read reddit, sometimes you've just got to sit back and watch the crash.

She being 5 years younger then the next sibling sounds like she was babied by you two.", "YTA but very soft. If your daughter was to tell this story from her perspective, most would think you are the AH as you never expressed any concerns about your other daughters' choices.\n\nIf you say no, you are likely damaging your relation with the daughter irrespective of whether you are right or wrong. You will also create a barrier for your daughter to come back if she ever feels unsafe in her relationship with bf/husband\n\nIt might be better to just ask her to delay the wedding by an year if she wants money from you.

He grew up to be a feminist and extremely well adjusted. If she turned out to be immature because the family indulged her, that's on you.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t back down\u2026\nLet\u2019s hope she wakes up soon and get\u2019s tired of this loser BEFORE she marries him.", "NTA.  $20K is a lot to throw away on a bad decision.

Sounds like her man needs to \"Man up\" and get and hold on to a job before they should be considering Marriage or Kids.

Hopefully, before any marriage.", "You are not the asshole. No one is required to pay for their children's wedding.", "NTA he sounds like my loser ex boyfriend. He might have mental health issues he needs help with, but from what you say, he's not in a place to be a good, reliable companion for your daughter.", "NTA, it sucks but at this point she has to make and live her own mistakes. Maybe it would make a difference if the family put on a united front, but \"interventions\" like you see on TV rarely work out in the short term.", "NTA. In this case it\u2019s more of protecting your daughter from a potential train wreck. You are not trying to stop her from getting married. You didn\u2019t try to control her. You just simply told her you would not be paying for the wedding or contributing to it. Is it unfair that you paid for her sisters weddings and not hers? \n\nWell\u2026that\u2019s a slippery slope. First off you\u2019re trying to protect her. And secondly it\u2019s your money to do with what you wish. Since a marriage isn\u2019t just about your daughter, but also about her future husband, it would stand to reason that you would want to like him enough to give them a $20K wedding gift as well. You don\u2019t care for him and he\u2019s not responsible enough to get married or be a responsible adult. So no, you\u2019re NTA. But, to be fair, if you\u2019re worried about favoritism, you could save the money you may have intended to give your youngest for a wedding gift to give to her at a later date when she needs it more. Like a down payment on a house, or her kids\u2019 college funds. Something else that would be more appropriate for her and not on the wedding. Heck you could even save it for her divorce costs if it comes down to that. They sound like they\u2019re not very mature or responsible or financially stable to be getting married. So that\u2019s a recipe for divorce. \n\nLet her elope. It\u2019s her choice to get married, she can pay for her own wedding, however it\u2019s funded and planned.", "Oof\n\nYou are in a tough spot because you contributed money to your other kid's weddings.  You don't want to seem like you are playing favorites, which I believe that isn't your intention.  The guy sounds like a loser.  I wouldn't want my kid in a relationship with them either, let alone get married.  She is young - only 22.  But the last thing you want to do is alienate her.  She needs a support system because that marriage isn't going to last.  I'm also concerned about her mental health. Was she always a slob or is this new behavior since the new boyfriend.\n\nI'm going to vote NTA based on context.", "I think your conversation with her about this should have been a lot different.  You should sit both of them down and set some clear expectations.  If you guys want me to pay for the wedding, here's some guidelines I have to make this work:\n1.  First... engagement.  let's see the ring?  Oh... we don't have one!  Let's figure that out and see how long we need to save up to get a ring.\n2.  Consistency on employment for a year or more.  \n3.  Pre-marital couples counseling... just throw this in here for added work so they can see compatibility \n\nJust coming out and saying NO sometimes can be harsh. Especially if after that, it's just all of your reasons for NO.  If it works, it works.  But also devising a plan can give them goals/a path to work towards.  PLUS, while doing this, they may see that marriage isn't for them.", "The real question is, why didn\u2019t you have this conversation with her from a different starting point?\n\nTell her all of your concerns, how you think she should wait for a while before marrying this person, and that you will pay for the wedding if she really wants to go through with it because you love her. But because you love her you\u2019re really afraid for her and the decisions she\u2019s making right now.\n\nKids tend to accept concerns and criticism when they\u2019re given out of love rather than as a dictation or ultimatum.\n\nNAH I guess because you\u2019re not really obligated to pay for anything, but I hope you find a better way to communicate with your daughter.", "NTA but you could also offer the daughter a compromise.  For every $1 she saves up the boyfriend must also contribute $1.  Then you also contribute $1.  This will at least make her feel like she isn't being rejected for her boyfriend.  And lets be honest, even if they did get some money together - how much will the two of them really save up?!?  Even if they each save a couple hundred dollars it won't harm you.  That token amount would at least save the relationship somewhat and when she realizes he is a loser she will still know you love her.", "[removed]", "I dont think you're an asshole but I'm going to suggest you go about this a little differently.

This dude ia going to suck your daughter dry.", "YTA.\n\nI get it, you know where this is going and doing what you think is right for your child but this is not your decision.  You don't get to choose her husband, her job, her career, or when and how many kids she has.  Those are her decisions.  If you paid for her sisters' weddings then you should pay for hers.  Not her second and third and fourth, but certainly her first.\n\nYou even admit:\n\n> she needs to understand that if she wants to make these kinds of adult decisions, then she will be treated like an adult\n\nbut you are not treating her like an adult, you are treating her like a child.\n\nWe (parents) have experience and wisdom that our children lack due solely to our having done things and made mistakes and watched others make mistakes.  We can share that wisdom with our children.  However, we do NOT know our children's world or all of the facts and circumstances surrounding it.  So it is for them to adapt and apply our advice to their situation.  And maybe they will make bad decisions despite this but they are their decisions and their lessons to learn.\n\nThat is not to say that it is easy to watch your child get hurt, physically, emotionally, mentally, or financially.  But sometimes it is the only way for them to learn important lessons.", "YTA, regardless of who she marries you are trying to pull a power play on your daughter, SHAME ON YOU!", "Not engaged but looking at venues \n\nBoth live like slobs, he\u2019s unemployed etc \n\nThat money isn\u2019t going to go toward a wedding \n\nNTA", "NTA - but there's more going on here. \n\nFirst: your daughter probably needs therapy, even it's just to help her sort out her thoughts. Maybe she has a neurodivergency? Regardless, the impulsivity of her actions means there's something going on that she desperately needs help with. \n\nSecond: the boyfriend sounds like a textbook Narcissist (of the actual, diagnosable Narcissistic Personality Disorder kind), and not supporting a relationship with him is the best thing you can do with your daughter. His behavior will NEVER get better from what you see... In fact it usually gets worse the longer you're exposed to him. \n\nThird: it sounds like there's tension between you and your daughter, and it has probably been there for a very long time. Whose fault is it? Doesn't matter, because it's there and needs to be worked through somehow. You want what's best for her, but she doesn't see it that way. Going together for counseling is a great step toward having a solid relationship.", "nta but dude, while i agree your daughter sounds immature and that this whole enchilada is a disaster, at the same time I would think you want to make sure she is safe and feels she can come to you with problems (such as maybe the lightbulb finally went on and she realizes her mistakes). By appearing critical of what she is doing and honestly cold, she may decide to not come to you for safety later.", "(Edit: ask her - if his mom is abusive, is she sure she wants to tie up her finances with her? This connects her legally not just to him, but to his parents. You could suggest that he go through the legal process to separate himself from his mother so she isn't considered someone who can make medical decisions if he's unconscious, inherit if he dies, etc. There's a good chance he won't do it. Which gives your daughter more to think about, and the connection itself give her reason to hesitate)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're not TA, but it's a bad idea. Deciding not to pay makes it easier for her to think of it as love/a relationship that's been treated unfairly. It will also seriously damage your relationship with her (because you paid for her sisters' weddings). Her eloping because of this, presumably without you there, also sends the message that you aren't there for her if you don't approve of her decisions. If/when she realizes that this guy is terrible, she's less likely to get out of the marriage because she'll have less of the emotional and financial support network she'd need (you may think 'of course I'd be there for her if she left him' but she's told you herself: she sees this as you not loving her as much as her sisters).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are you hoping to do by withholding the money? She already knows you don't approve. The only thing this does is turn the situation into something more adversarial. Instead of a parent whose words she should consider, even if she doesn't follow the advice right now, you're the 'bad guy.' It would be worth being the bad guy if it protected her, but this doesn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: A better approach: you and her disagree about the guy, and that won't change via argument. So change the focus. Tell her you'll pay, but talk about how good of an idea it is to marry a bit later. Try to find practical reasons that aren't related to the relationship being awful. Does she know his family well? This would legally tie her to them. If she and her husband are both in an accident, could there be a situation where his family, now her family, have power over her medical care (if for some reason you're not available - maybe you got in the accident too or maybe you're in another country or camping somewhere without service)? Does she want his family trying to claim her assets if something happens to her?\n\nYou could also suggest things that would let her find out the truth for herself. 'I know we don't agree on him. How about he babysits some kids? That way you can know for yourself whether or not he'll care for them.'\n\nYou could also think of ways to help her get the 'grown up' feeling she wants. It could even merge with this. Learning things about budgeting and how to look over all expenses shows how little he contributes and how much he spends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf possible, you can tell her that you'll pay, but it would wipe out all the savings you have liquid (everything else being in a retirement fund that'll be taxed to hell if you take it out early) and would prefer another 6 months of time to get it together.\n\nIf you think it would work, you could say you're concerned about the speed of marriage. But that could cause another argument.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes she want to be a housewife? He'll need to get a job then. Talk to her about it in terms of the future she wants, not the one you want for her. What are her specific goals and whether or not he fits into them.", "YTA - not that I necessarily disagree but you have to be prepared that what you see as 'doing the right thing' is essentially putting terms & conditions on one daughter's wedding that you didn't on the other two ... and setting up a situation that might end with a broken relationship with the one daughter.  \n\nAlso, you talk about her immaturity and desire to grow up ... and that type of thing almost always reflects back onto the parents and how they treated the children. So before dumping on her, perhaps a little introspection is in order.", "YTA. You can do whatever you want with your money, but by saying what you did, you only pushed her closer to the boyfriend. You could have had an adult conversation with her where you asked her about how this relationship makes her feel, and sincerely expressed your worries and what you are seeing from your side. You can still fix this, but you need to apologize.", "Yeah. She is 22 and taking care of an unemployed 30 year old that she only met 9 months ago.... Hopefully, she will come to her senses.\n\nIf I were OP and the rest of her family I wouldn't fight her on it - just be firm with not providing support. Once she realizes that she isn't getting the attention or feedback that she probably craves in the leadup to a wedding, nor is anyone actively trying to fight her decision, she may lose interest in this guy.

I'd avoid conjecture.\n\nI would also preface the conversation with something along the lines of \"I'm bringing this up because I love you and I want the best for you, and this will be the only time that I bring it up. I don't want you to think that this is a negative against you in any way just that I am seeing some things that concern me for a long-term relationship and I wanted to talk to you about what those are and why.

On top of that I didn't know what were red flags and why they were because I was relatively young and naive. I wish I had known what to look for back then it would have saved me so much. \n\nAnd then at the end, hopefully she stayed long enough to listen, I would say something like \"you are my daughter and I love you no matter what. I think you deserve to have the absolute best in the world, be it your prince charming and a castle or living on your own driving race cars (or whatever) and I don't want you to settle for less or have less because you feel like you don't deserve it.

Usually I'm all for things being equitable between siblings, even in the case where you don't approve of the spouse. If your daughter was 26 and had been with him for 2 years, my answer would probably be different (even w/ the other issues) but there are so many issues her you have to stack them on top of each other to fit into a football stadium.\n\nIf she does marry him, I would:\n1. Put the money aside. Worse case scenario, you have lawyer's fees for your daughter if they divorce, a down-payment for a home if she ends up leaving him or post high school education fund for your grandchildren. \n2. Update your will. Put the assets for your daughter into a trust so he can't get his hands on it and she can't spend it on assets that would be join ownership   w/ him. Home in her name only, education for the kids, etc.\n\nYou can always decide to give them the money and/or change the will later if he becomes a good husband & father. Keep in mind that doesn't mean he has to be perfect, but make your daughter happy and  not be the lazy, dead-beat, momma's boy we all suspect he is.", "Yeah\u2026.OP it\u2019s worth asking mom \n\nDoes he smoke weed, drink, or do other substances? \n\nThere\u2019s no engagement, he\u2019s unemployed, they live like slobs, and they want.

Money. \n\nI have a feeling they say things like they want to get married but I do not think the money is for a wedding. \n\nEither they are chronically lazy and want the cash or they are using something (or he is and she supports the habit) and want the cash.\n\nAsk her if she wants the cash or if you can pay direct to the venue.

I hope your daughter sees sense before wasting time (let alone having any kids) with this guy, who seems to have more red flags than China.
