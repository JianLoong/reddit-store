I also suggest you take a a bunch of pictures. If it doesn\u2019t disappear, call the police.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to give it to him. I hope your dad sides with you. If he doesn\u2019t see if you can take it to your moms or other relatives to keep it from him.", "NTA\n\nThe signed jersey is your personal property. Your stepbrother is not entitled to your property. No one in their right mind would expect you to hand it over.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the family meeting is because your stepbrother and stepmother realize they owe you an apology.", "NTA - it is yours, not his. Not sure if you mean he wants you to give it to him to wear during whatever game he is watching or permanently, but that doesn't matter. It is yours, and your choice.\n\nFrankly your SM needs to get over herself. In a blended family she should not be pushing her child's wants above what you want like this. What does your dad say?", "Why does you stepmother just decide that your stepbrother is entitled to have YOUR things???? NTA, but your stepmother and stepbrother is! Also your father definitely is as well if he doesn\u2019t have your back on this!", "NTA. Tell them your name isn't Cinderella and you won't be bullied into giving away your possessions.", "NTA. Why is your SM bullying you into giving g it to him? It\u2019s yours. Hold firm we are rooting for you.", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t imagine having a family that has the audacity to pull this kind of stuff. That is your personal property,  not his, and all rights of ownership belong to you - no matter whatever happens during this meeting. \n\nLike, what could he say that will grant him ownership \u201cI want it so give it to me.\u201d He has no rights to it and certainly doesn\u2019t have more importance than you.\n\nThe real AH in this situation is the SB and possibly the SM. It\u2019s clear the jersey is yours and that you still have an interest in it but she\u2019s actively ignoring that and putting her own son before you. Hopefully the dad comes in and helps out; this is a shitty thing he\u2019s pulled.", "NTA- don\u2019t sell it! Post the pic of you getting it signed and tag Steph in it, tell them what\u2019s happening. Also, document it all. This is not fair or acceptable to you. I\u2019m so upset for you.", "NTA. WTH- no to the family meeting! The jersey is yours. You\u2019re the one that met Steph Curry. If your dad and SM always give in to your SB, he\u2019s going to be even more of a spoiled brat than what he sounds like now. I am so sorry about this, OP. There shouldn\u2019t even be a question about this.\n\nETA: I hope your dad is sticking up for you in this. If not, shame on him!", "NTA \n\nHide it. Hide it now. If both are THAT entitled to it they will get it or ruin it so no one can have it. \n\nHide it well. Idk what your place looks like so you'll have to be creative about it and instead put the non signed one in the frame.", "NTA- I seriously don't mean to offend but is SB Autistic? Why on earth would he have any claim to your jersey?", "Nta, but if you don\u2019t have a lock on your door talk to your dad about one? God knows what else of yours they\u2019ll try and claim.", "NTA - stay away from your SB and SM - they both evil. Good luck with your Dad.", "NTA.\n\nIt is yours signed for you not the sb.  Why has your father not put a stop to her madness.", "NTA\n\nHe only wanted it after he found out it was genuine so odds are he wants it to sell online.

I get your SB is a young teen and \u201cwants something\u201d but honestly they\u2019re way, way, way out of line. I\u2019m a 38yo mom if that matters at all, this honestly makes my blood boil. Lock your doors and possibly hide your jerseys and any other valuables, even though that\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to have to consider in your own home. I\u2019m sorry!", "Why in the world is he entitled to your jersey because he wants it? By that rate, you should just ask your step mom for her wedding ring because you like it, and she should give it up, right? NTA", "NTA - can you give the short to your mom or mom's family to keep it safe?", "Don't give him the jersey at all", "NTA\n\nIts YOUR jersey, why should you have to give it to him? And why is your stepmom trying to force you?  I Hope your dad at least sticks up for you. I would be worried about leaving the jersey - they will probably try to steal it", "NTA, and hide that shit ASAP", "NTA: highly recommend moving the jersey to a safe location till they stop caring", "NTA\n\nTell them if it disappears you\u2019ll report it to the police. Tell them it\u2019s yours and they have no right taking it from you, and if they do, it\u2019s stealing. Do not debate with them, or defend your reasons for keeping it. Just repeat that no you are not giving it away and they need to stop badgering you about it. No means no. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your family sux.", "NTA. So ridiculous", "NTA\n\nYour stepmom & her child are on another level of entitled\u2026i hope your dad on your side.", "NTA... But you should get the jersey out of the house and somewhere safe.  I'd be afraid your SB or SM would take it. They sound really entitled.", "NTA\n the nerve. \nStepbrother is a whiny weasel .\nStepmother is a piece of work\nDad best put his foot down\nHow long before weasely stepbrother just steals it from Frame now he knows it exsists", "Nta. Can you keep it at your grandparents or somewhere for safe keeping?  Dont sell it. That is a good memory for you. Dont let sb ruin it", "NTA, don\u2019t give him anything", "NTA,\n\nif he didn't take the unsigned jersey, Try to write a fake signature on the unsigned one and then give it to him or even better.. put the fake jersey away and easy for them to find.  At least for awhile. If you live together, he'll probably try to swipe it, or worse his mom will. Just based on his inability to take a ' No' from you. hide the Real jersey away really well", "NTA but you might want to keep it somewhere secure that your stepmom and stepbrother don't have access to.", "NTA, but let your dad know how stepmom is mouthing off demands to give her son YOUR jersey. This is not your fight. Say no. Easiest 1 word response and stick to it.", "NTA. You need to hide that jersey somewhere safe. It'll either conveniently go missing or end up destroyed.", "NTA. Is your mom or your grandparents in the picture and trustworthy? If so put it in her place or go with your dad to get a safe deposit box and put it there.", "NTA.\n\nI recommend that you hide your jersey before both your stepbrother and your stepmother take it from you. FYI: if they do, then you can the police for thief (signed jerseys are worth A LOT of $$$)!!!", "Nta. U should move the jersey to somewhere safe", "NTA. What kind of twisted logic are they using? It's yours, why does he and his mom think they have any right to it?", "NTA and I am getting heated just reading about it going to a \"family meeting\". I hope you dad sticks up for you. It is YOUR shirt, end of sentence. And to ask...demand that you give it to him? Outrageous. What does he have that you can pester back about? Even if you don't care for it. Just to let him know how it feels. And his mom is a real AH as well. Please don't let them bully you!", "NTA, where is your dad in this? you are being bullied!", "This. Stepmom can she\u2019ll out the money to get her son one, demanding yours is ridiculous. Might want to find a place to store it though to be safe.", "The jersey needs to go to a trusted friend or relative for safekeeping like right now", "Call the police if it does **NOT** disappear?", "We just finished talking about it and my SB wanted to have it permanently but my dad said no before i could so its still in my room but my dad and SM are in a shouting match right now so i might just sell it so that way there is no more arguing about it.", "Put the fake signed jersey in the frame and hide the real one.", "I would find it suspicious, after all the brou-ha-ha. Why isn't it gone? IT'S A TRAP!!!!", "I'm glad your dad is sticking up for you -and I've had thought very, very little of him if he hadn't. Is SM always this unreasonable?", "Thats just what they WANT you to think", "He obviously did something to it and put it back! Don\u2019t trust it!", "And please don't sell it - it is yours, and your SM and SB need to learn not to be such entitled AH.", "This is the first time she has done something like this so i was kind of surprised+they just moved in last week so i cannot say if she is going to always be like this", ">they just moved in last week\n\nOh no. You need to get a lock on your door asap.", "Please don't leave it in plain sight. This kind of conflict often leads to theft or property destruction.", "I hope she won't be, for your sake. But it does sound like you have a great dad who isn't going to tolerate you being treated badly in comparison to her son. I certainly wouldn't put up with someone thinking that they were going to treat their kids better than mine either - the relationship would end first!", "You should not leave the jersey anywhere where it is easily accessible.  Either store it with a trusted family member or get some locks.\n\n\n\nLock the door to your room when you aren't in it.  Get a lock for your closet that uses a different key or combination and lock that one too.  Keep anything valuable in the locked closet.  Do not give a key to the closet to anyone else.  Your dad will likely need a key to the bedroom in case of emergency.\n\n\n\nYour stepmom or step brother will probably try to steal the jersey.", "Find a safe place to keep it where your stepmom cant find it. \n\nWe've seen what happens in other posts on this sub.", "Please put it safe - round a friends house or something. An 'accident' seems likely to me."]}
