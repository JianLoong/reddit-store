Does he know there are multiple dogs? Did you think Henry was secured somewhere when you were focusing on Homer?", "NTA. Derek was incredibly stupid. Why would he put his stuff on the floor in the first place? If the dog didn't get it, somebody might trip over it. Who uses the floor instead of a table?", "If he left it on the floor in a room your dog was expected to be in,  that\u2019s on him\n\nIf it was on a counter or area the dog is supposed to be trained away from, more reasonable to pay", "NTA It sounds like Derek is a few fries short of a happy meal to leave a bag of food on the floor in the same room with a dog!", "NTA\n\nWho in their normal mind leaves food on the floor in the first place?  Surely you would place it on a bench or table.\n\nThis is your home and Derek is a visitor who left his food on the floor...  it's also the dog's home....  Blame is on Derek.  You don't owe him a meal.  This is a consequence of his actions.", "NTA, based on your comments in response to another poster that the food was knowingly left on the floor of the same room the dog was in. \n\nI have a very food motivated dog. Training can only go so far. The vast majority of dogs, especially food driven ones, are going to eat food that is literally left on the floor next to them. It\u2019s expecting too much to tempt them to that extent.", "A lot of context is left out here.  You mention that Derek left the Starbucks on the floor and you went outside to corral a dog, while presumably he was not there with his food, or he would have prevented the other dog from getting it.\n\nWhat exactly happened?  Where was Henry when you left to get Homer?  Where was Derek?  Did Homer get out because of the delivery and so you knew it was there? \n\nI guess what I am getting at is that if Derek left the room thinking you were watching both of your dogs and you knew he had food on the floor, you probably should have given him a heads up about Henry being unattended.  If you were clueless about the food, and just focused on the dogs, then you can't really be held responsible.\n\nTo save peace, I would probably, if I had no clue about the food and Derek could not say that I was watching Henry, would still offer to split the cost.  It would be a goodwill gesture that would cost $10 . . . definitely worth it.  If Derek, left the food on the floor without your knowledge and without a clue as to where the dogs were, then he really just learned an expensive lesson.", "YTA. Your dogs are your responsibility. Every time your dog misbehaves, do you just go, \"dogs will be dogs!\" Nah, dude. Sure, maybe he shouldn't have put food on the floor, but ultimately it's your dog that got into the food. At least offer to pay for half. Both your dog and Derek can take the blame.", "YTA- because you need to train your dogs better.  You have a husky escaping the yard while another dog is eating whatever food he can find and needs to be contained with gates all over your house??\n\nThese are not well-trained pups.  For the dogs\u2019 own safety it\u2019s time for you to step up their training.", "NTA with the added information.   He found out and hopefully learned a lesson.    I don't pay rewards for stupidity.", "NTA. \n\nSometimes dogs get out the front door and most dogs can\u2019t resist food left on the floor. Nothing here suggests to me that your dogs need training. I assume they\u2019re house broken and don\u2019t bite people? I\u2019d say that\u2019s adequate. Derek is an idiot, but you might want to just pay up to keep the peace.", "YTA. It's your dog shouldn't be eating his food. If it's not his job to watch your dog, you should have your dog in a dog house, when you're away. \n\nHe is also the asshole. There could have been chocolate.", "YTA. Your dogs, your responsibility.", "YTA - train your dog. Huskys are notoriously tricky and need strict training. Dogs should be trained not to eat random food on the ground in case of poisoning.", "YTA. You\u2019re responsible for your dog.", "NTA, I don't see any obligation on your end to do that. Especially if he knows there is dogs, that was totally on him. I might personally feel bad and might offer but if he's acting like you owe him, hell naw.", "It's common knowledge that as soon as something hits the floor it belongs to the dog. If the food was on a chair, table, desk, stool, taped to the wall, whatever, I would say YTA. But being on the floor, any dog would presume it's fair game. NTA.", "NTA. He's 19 and knows how digs work. He willingly left his stuff in the floor and went to the bathroom.  Life lessons are hard. Blaming you when you weren't there for his stupidity makes him TA.", "YTA. The general rule is that if your kid or your pet breaks something, you as the responsible party are indeed responsible for replacing the item. Should the food have been on the floor, no, but still this is your dog who did the \u201cwrong.\u201d This is one situation where you just have to suck it up because your dog\u2019s actions are your responsibility as the owner.", "Any food on the floor belongs to the dogs.\n\nNTA", "NTA \nanyone who leaves food on my floor is essentially feeding it to the dogs. That\u2019s his own problem and I think it\u2019s rude that he would ask you to pay for it.", "YTA. Train your dog and/or pay for stuff they eat or damage.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But he's a scent hound who can smell food from a mile away. \n\nYou can't honestly believe that any dog is trainable to the point that it can be left alone in a room with human food on the floor and not eat it. That's what Derek did. The dog was on the couch. Derek was in a chair in the same room. Derek knew the dog was there and left him alone in the room with the food on the floor.
