Even in a lesbian relationship people automatically make assumptions surrounding words like, \"very upset\" and the repetition of the excuse alone would be treated as a red flag.

Shes inadvertently making you out as some kind of shut in or party pooper to her friends which isn't going to help them like you and it's going to only cause strain in all of her relationships.", "NTA.  She needs to grow up and learn to assert herself FOR herself.  Using you as an excuse is immature and rude toward you.", "NTA.  If I were you, I\u2019d make a public announcement to all the mutual friends that I found out my wife is doing this and it\u2019s not true.  Your reputation is already suffering.  I hope your wife reads this and realizes how selfish she\u2019s being.  There\u2019s other ways to pretend you\u2019re busy and can\u2019t do something.  Not to mention, you can just be ok with someone else experiencing a negative emotion. I hope your wife is getting therapy for her issues.", "It's okay to get touched out, and your wife will have to accept that about herself in order to solve this. The right group of friends won't be offended by it, and will welcome her whenever she wants to join them. \n\nHiding behind you sometimes is fine. Throwing you under the bus is not. It is okay for people to think you two are homebodies. It is not okay for them to think you are isolating her, or getting angry if she goes out. This is just something you too need to talk out, without pressure. NAH.", "NAH. Your wife needs to be able to set boundaries, but she isn\u2019t an asshole for it.", "NAH.\n\nYour wife has found a way to stick up for herself, and uses you as an excuse\u2026 it sucks, but at least she\u2019s standing up for herself.\n\nYour feelings are hurt because you are the scapegoat. This totally makes sense! \n\nHopefully you can find a good at for her to stick up for herself without throwing you under a bus\u2026", "No is a complete sentence that requires no explanation or justification. Women in particular have a very difficult time with this because we are indoctrinated to be sweet and kind. Ladies start practicing. This is one skill every female MUST have. It gets easier with time.", "NTA- I agree, but it is going to create stress in all of her relationships. The way his wife is wording it- and doing it on repetition- is going to cause problems. If I was her friend or family and was repeatedly hearing that OP wants her home or OP needs her or OP doesn\u2019t want her to go or some other variation, I would begin to become stressed and worried that my friend is being abused. What does the wife think is going to happen to other people\u2019s pet of OP and their relationship if she always makes OP the bad guy?  No wonder her friends and family don\u2019t like OP if this is what they are hearing.", "It\u2019s also just a potential issue for OP, her wife constantly using her as an excuse instead of just being honest or saying no could lead her friends to viewing OP in a poor light. They may start to feel OP is controlling. It\u2019s not a major issue considering that isn\u2019t the case, but these are her friends, people she wants in her life and cares about. Generally people feel it\u2019s important for their friends and partners/spouses to get along well, but this can cause them and OP to have issues getting along. Even if they don\u2019t begin to feel OP is controlling they will likely feel like OP is causing issues. It\u2019s not fair to OP.\n\nShe can use excuses, but using OP as one is just harmful in the long run. She could say she has stuff to do at home, or she\u2019s tired, not feeling well, all those things if she really isn\u2019t comfortable just saying no she doesn\u2019t want to go out.", "Exactly this!\n\nShe\u2019s fine with making OP the bad guy & that isn\u2019t right. At all \n\nNTA", "Exactly. She\u2019s giving people even more reason to not like her wife. Making her the controlling villain in their relationship.", "NTA... and every time she does this, correct it in front of them (Stand with the group \"Oh no hunny! I have NO problem. You wanted me to take care... this would be the perfect time!\") ... or after the fact (text or call the person) \"Hey! Wifey is totally available for your activity. She must have gotten her dates confused.\"", "NTA  \n\n\nShe is legit making you look bad depending on HOW she is phrasing it and I would not want my partner to use me as an excuse either.   \n\n\nMaybe she needs to look deep inside and figure out WHY she feels the need to make an excuse over just saying \"No thank you\" and leave it at that. Why make it more complicated than it needs to be?", "NTA and i would be pretty upset about this blatant selfishness. she\u2019s not a very good partner.", "NTA. She needs to stop this  She makes you sound controlling by saying \" OP would be upset if I wasn't home.\" She needs to learn to say \" Thanks for asking but I will be unable to go.\"  \" Thanks for asking but I have to work late.\"  Etc. She also  needs to learn to be comfortable around some other people not just you. Find a couples counselor.", "NTA She's making you the bad guy in a way. \"No I can't come out and play cause of my wife\". If your wife is willing to compromise, might be able to find a less harsh wording that accomplishes the same thing. But it does kinda need to be phrased in a \"I want a night in with my wife\" vs  \"I can't go cause my wife wants a night in at home\"", "NTA. She isn\u2019t being fair to you", "NTA i definitely understand what your wife is going through. I used to do the same thing with my dad when I wanted to get out of sleepovers. But that was when I was 14. Being able to stand up for yourself is an incredibly powerful life skill that adults need and using you as a crutch is only limiting your wife\u2019s ability to be taken seriously as well as painting you as the bad guy in many scenarios, possibly even making her friends feel worried for you wife. \n\nI know it sounds dumb but practice in a mirror. Do something that makes you feel confident. For me its putting on makeup and heels. Work on it everyday with simple tasks. I had a journal that I had to mark off that I gave 3 people genuine complements each week. Then I worked up to getting to know two new people\u2019s name every 3 weeks. Finally finishing with simple no\u2019s each time I didn\u2019t really want to do something. This is just what worked for me. Your wife not being able to say no by herself is doing herself a disservice. Your scenario is different from mine but I do know confidence makes anyone happier.\n\nSo NTA you weren\u2019t wrong to ask to not be an excuse and I think helping your wife say no is the most kind thing you can do.", "NTA", "NTA. I would very firmly ask her to top putting words in your mouth. I hate when people say I've said something when I did not. Let everyone know, subtly and kindly, that her choices are her own and not yours in front of her. Basically call her BS out.", "Your wife should be more conscious of how she talks about you to other people. You don\u2019t want to come off as a controlling monster. I think it\u2019s ok to use your spouse for excuses to get out of stuff, but it should be agreed upon first, and neutral stuff like \u201cwe have plans already.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. I think she only is if she keeps it up even after you\u2019ve explained how it makes you feel.", "NTA", "Yeah those excuses are unkind to you and if she's going to use you as an excuse they need to be neutral ones though that ship has probably sailed now that she's established this impression of your character so now if she changes the tone of the excuses it will likely just seem like she's trying to be less overt about you being controlling.", "Or it says She's a loving partner wanting to comfort her partner after a bad day.", "It might say that once, but repetition makes it looks suspicious. OP's wife is going to make her friends and family think that OP is trying to isolate her because she can't bring herself to be honest with the people in her life. She needs to grow up and grow a spine and stop ruining OP's reputation amongst her (the wife's) family and friends.", ">but doing so damages OP's relationships with those people and their image of OP, \n\nExcept that's not what OP said. What OP actually said was that her wife saying \"I want to be there for her when she gets home from a long day\" *might* make her look controlling. OP is valuing an imaginary potential slight over her wife's emotional wellbeing. Not to mention none of the excuses OP laid out sound controlling in the slightest. Claiming that people *must* take them as reasons to hate OP is also assuming that every single one of their friends is a moron who will jump to conclusions based on those innocuous excuses. If I heard somebody say they couldn't attend an event because they already had plans *with their wife* I wouldn't be confused or put off in the slightest.\n\nEasy YTA vote", "Yes! That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking. Wife is damaging OP\u2019s relationships with other people because it\u2019s easier for her than setting boundaries. That\u2019s a really crappy thing to do to a spouse. She\u2019s making her spouse \u201cthe bad guy\u201d in order to spare herself possible unpleasantness. NTA OP \n\nI\u2019m aware they\u2019re both women but I\u2019m using \u201cbad guy\u201d as simple shorthand for clarity.", "NTA honestly people pleasing to this extent leads to manipulation and dishonesty, which are best discouraged and avoided when possible. Empowering her to set firm boundaries and FOLLOW THROUGH with what intentions she\u2019s stated are good goals.", "This is a completely fine strategy with things like door to door salesmen \"Sorry, my wife makes these decisions. She's not here.\" [Door swings closed.]\n\nIt's not fine for friends and family that know both of you (unless it's true). Discuss it with her, share that you're not happy with it, and work with her on getting over her discomfort. That aside, some people I used to be friends with would be really pushy for a Reason I didn't want to do whatever thing, and this may be a stepping stone for your wife to openly sharing her preferences. Provided she's receptive and responsive when you talk to her about it, that's all pretty fair, imo.\n\nNAH", "NTA. I used to have a group of girlfriends where one of them always blamed her boyfriend for her not being able to hang out. For a long time we thought he was being a controlling dick. When someone eventually confronted him, he showed text messages that showed he was encouraging her to go out with her friends, but she just wanted to go and see him all the time so was pretending to us that he was the one preventing her coming out. It\u2019s not cool and yes, if she keeps doing this, friends are going to get the impression you are at best clingy and needy, at worst controlling and emotionally abusive.", "NTA - My roommate would use me as an excuse not to go somewhere.\nIt got me and them in trouble once when I didn't know they told someone we were apparently \"having dinner\" when we didn't actually go out and that someone was confused when they saw an Instagram post of me with someone else that evening.", "Hi thanks for your input. No, none of us are visibly queer actually. People are usually quite surprised when they first learn that we're queer and married to each other", "So if, every time you invited a friend out, that friend blamed her spouse for being unable to go out with you \u2013 not just because she has plans with her spouse, but because her spouse apparently can't be left alone, because her spouse would miss her, because her spouse would be upset \u2013 and you would never once wonder what the hell was going on? If that so, then I really hope that no one you know ever relies on you to pick up hints that they're being controlled by their spouse, because that's exactly how it happens. People don't just come out and say (or even themselves necessarily realize) that they can't go out because their spouse won't let them; they give excuses just like OP's wife. OP's wife is poisoning her relationships with the wife's friends and family by throwing OP under the bus instead of acting like an adult and speaking for herself."]}
