She\u2019s using you as an excuse for not being able to set boundaries with strangers and acquaintances. But in doing so creates stress in a relationship that is truly important to her.", "NTA\n\nHer comment says it all.\n\n>her friends wouldn't argue with her when I was mentioned.\n\nSo she's casting you as the boogyman. Of course this will leave a negative impression on people. Also, she needs to learn to own her refusals.", "NTA buts its sure not nice to make you the baddie when she doesn't want to do stuff. Tell her to grow a back bone and use her own self as an excuse to not do stuff and leave you out of it.", "NTA\n\nThis is a just a great way to ensure your assimilation into the family and friends is delayed even more! She needs to be hyping you up, not using you to avoid accountability for her own preferences", "NTA. However, I do think that since she prioritised her friends' and family's feelings over yours when you told her that you are uncomfortable with the excuse she used,   there is some work that needs to be done here.", "NTA. Would've said it's not so bad to make up fake plans with a partner now and then like \"Oh, we're at my partner's parent's place for dinner that day\". You know, benign stuff for people who don't take no for an answer.\n\nWhen that turns into sounding like \"Oh, she can't come out because her partner wouldnt like it\" then it reflects badly on you. It gives people the impression that she can't go out because you're tired, which is kind of ridiculous.\n\nI'm always careful about how I talk about a partner because I know that a huge amount of what my friends think about them will be based on it.", "NTA\n\nShe's going to make people dislike you and that's not fair.", "NTA.  Using your partner as an excuse is only okay when your partner doesn\u2019t mind it.", "Nta, my partner and I are go to excuses for each other but thats because we have discussed and agreed this. Doing it without your agreement in a way that paints you in a negative light is spineless immature behaviour. I would tell her each time she does this moving forwards you will contact them and give the truth. \n\nI would recommend discussing this further and helping your wife to get past needing to be the good guy all the time. If I can make a guess she is either the eldest or only child to old school parents and values herself poorly so feels she has to please others to make them like her. Please tell her this is not the way, those that matter won't care and those that care don't matter.", "NTA. It Is a Big Deal. Every excuses that is just a plain lie is a big deal. What about teaching/telling your wife to grow a spine and own her choices and decisions ? \nTo assume the responsibility of the truth, not to come with another lame excuse that doesn't imply you.\n\nBecause the sweetness of a person can become sour fast if it means in fact they are so avoidand of confronting arguments, and afraid of dealing with other's disappointment or whatever feeling, that they prefer to be dishonest. \n\nAnd for the fact that you mentioned that is very true indeed : she is painting an image of you to her friends that is not you and not flattering to you. And that is neither nice or sweet to do to a loving partner.", "There\u2019s a bigger issue than her using you for excuses, the real issue is she isn\u2019t hearing or listening to you. You asked her to stop doing that & she ignored you. That\u2019s a problem. \n\nSince she doesn\u2019t want to listen to you, tell her next time she blames you for her not wanting to go out you will contact her family or friends directly & tell them you have no issues with her doing whatever. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Her comments may lead her friends to have a negative view of you. That's not fair. I imagine that she's just going for an \"easy\" excuse instead of standing up for herself, but this can have a real effect on how her friends will interact with you.
