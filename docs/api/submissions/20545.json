She needs to be hyping you up, not using you to avoid accountability for her own preferences", "NTA. However, I do think that since she prioritised her friends' and family's feelings over yours when you told her that you are uncomfortable with the excuse she used,   there is some work that needs to be done here.", "NTA. Would've said it's not so bad to make up fake plans with a partner now and then like \"Oh, we're at my partner's parent's place for dinner that day\". You know, benign stuff for people who don't take no for an answer.\n\nWhen that turns into sounding like \"Oh, she can't come out because her partner wouldnt like it\" then it reflects badly on you. It gives people the impression that she can't go out because you're tired, which is kind of ridiculous.\n\nI'm always careful about how I talk about a partner because I know that a huge amount of what my friends think about them will be based on it.", "NTA\n\nShe's going to make people dislike you and that's not fair.", "NTA.  Using your partner as an excuse is only okay when your partner doesn\u2019t mind it.", "Nta, my partner and I are go to excuses for each other but thats because we have discussed and agreed this. Doing it without your agreement in a way that paints you in a negative light is spineless immature behaviour. I would tell her each time she does this moving forwards you will contact them and give the truth. \n\nI would recommend discussing this further and helping your wife to get past needing to be the good guy all the time.

And that is neither nice or sweet to do to a loving partner.", "There\u2019s a bigger issue than her using you for excuses, the real issue is she isn\u2019t hearing or listening to you. You asked her to stop doing that & she ignored you.
