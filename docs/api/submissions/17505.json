OP can approve of Trevor because she sees that he treats her son well and makes him happy without ever communicating with Trevor directly.\n\nLove isn't transitive - OP loves her son and her son loves his fianc\u00e9 but that doesn't mean OP must love her son's fianc\u00e9.  Plenty of people who do share a common language with their in-laws don't have a relationship that goes beyond awkward small-talk, and if OP would only make awkward small talk with Trevor if she could talk to him, neither of them is missing out on much.", "Yes NAH, this sub is ridiculous. It costs time, effort, and money to learn a new language. Years of effort and potentially thousands of dollars if you\u2019re not able to self study. As someone who successfully learned a new language, I can tell you it is a lot of work, and there\u2019s no way I would have done it if I wasn\u2019t self motivated.\n\nWhat right does the son have to demand her to work extra? If she doesn\u2019t want to cut an extra 1-2 hours a day out of her life she doesn\u2019t have to. People on this sub love to tell others to do, but let\u2019s see how far they would get being forced to study something they don\u2019t want to.\n\nAnd to those who say \u201cjust learn a few words\u201d, well that\u2019s a meaningless gesture. A few words is no where near enough to communicate.", "There's nothing to say the other part is. If the OP doesn't want to learn a new language as they can't be bothered when other channels of communication is present and the one who uses the sign language isn't bothered, then in my view the OP is not a AH. OP might have a different perspective to her son.", "It's not the same fucking argument at all. You were talking about it as a problem of laziness, but the deaf person is literally incapable of speaking and hearing English.", "Why wouldn\u2019t learning at least some basic signs be worth it unless you believed that communicating with your future son in law is beneath you or not of importance?", "YTA. Try making a little effort. Consider if the situation were reversed.", "OP=YTA\n\n<<Trevor in all this time hasn't seem bothered by it so I just didn't think it was worth it.>>\n\nYOU DECIDED both of these things and you say it all --YOU don't find it worth the bother.  \n\nIf you don't want to ruin your relationship with your son, make some d\\*mn effort.", "YTA. The audacity to say that Trevor doesn\u2019t have a problem with it because he\u2019s never brought it up to you. How? How would he bring it up to you? He can\u2019t communicate with you without an interpreter. He obviously does feel bad about it and has told Ricky to tell you because he CANT tell you\u2026 because you won\u2019t learn sign language. Like? This fact alone and the fact you didn\u2019t understand that is insane to me. Ricky is your son and Trevor is going to be a part of your family. It\u2019s something important to them and by not even trying you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t care about or respect them enough to put in the slightest effort. Huge YTA.", "In school we were always taught ASL because a student in the grade above me (a few years older but was held back) was deaf. His brother and I were always good friends growing up and he taught us all basic sign. I even had a French teacher in grade 9-10 ish years teach us the alphabet in French while also signing it. The student had a tablet but still. Another student came along who signed its an important skill to have even if you have to spell out words like I often do. You are very much the asshole. If a whole school can accommodate and teach all the students to sign then you can too. I feel like you will be the MIL that actually doesn't like their Son IL. Learn the basics it won't kill you.\nY A T H!!!!!!!!!", "Honestly the fact that you haven\u2019t bothered to even TRY learn ANY ASL over the MANY years your son has been dating Trevor would be enough for me to go less or no contact with you as a parent. You shouldn\u2019t have to be told to do this - you should\u2019ve wanted to do this proactively YEARS ago. \n\nYTA", "ESH. If he spoke a different language, would your son expect you to also learn the language?", "YTA\n\nTime for you to step up and learn how to communicate with your soon to be son in law. I would even have started learning when they were dating, if only to be able to communicate with someone close to your son. However, start now, its fairly straightforward and it will make your son happy (and his soon to be husband)", "This", "Yep. It's not as though the OP's son is expecting them to become fluent by the end of the month... but at least learn some basics. \n\nI've been taking online ASL classes since January and know enough to hold a decent conversation! I've also learned that a lot of ASL signs are pretty obvious (anything to do with music/instruments, and bowling are two examples that come to mind). So it's not too hard to pick up the basics.\n\nI also don't know any deaf/HOH people in \"real life\" who use ASL (met plenty of folks online). I'm just learning because I think it's an important skill and I want to be able to communicate if/when I come across someone who is deaf/HOH. \n\nOP, if you care about your son, you need to make the effort.", "It's not a totally fair comparison, but it does show something. You expect the Finnish person to learn English, you aren't willing to adapt. Learning sign language is terribly hard, it will cost months and months. It's not unfair OP did not jump into getting lessons the straight away.", "I personally would. I learn basic phrases to prepare for going on holiday in another country for a few days, so why wouldn\u2019t I at least try to learn the language of someone who is joining my family\n\nI learned makaton (simple sign) with both of my kids when they were non verbal toddlers, it made communicating their needs so much easier and they both still use some signs occasionally now (2 and 6 years old)", "YTA - What would you do if one of your grandchildren were deaf ?        \nIgnore them ?       \nHe is going to be a part of your family.          \nYour son is totally right.", "YTA\n\nYou weren\u2019t in the beginning but now he is family.

Even if you don\u2019t end up fluent, you should be able to learn some basics.\n\nThink how much fun you will have when you can talk to each other secretly in public", "ESH except Trevor\n\nFor you, you should put forth some sort of effort. He\u2019s been with your son for YEARS. Learn finger spelling at least. It\u2019s simple enough. Maybe a few common signs so that you can talk like the ASL equivalent of a toddler when around Trevor. \n\nRicky sucks because he should have told you WHY it was so important for you to learn sooner than he did. I\u2019d like to think if he had told you sooner, you\u2019d have put forth some effort.\n\nWhat is important now is that you ***DO*** learn some. What I would do is start with letters and numbers. Then ask Ricky and Trevor for a list of words that would be most helpful for you to know, then focus on them. Things like hello, goodbye, food/eat, drink, etc. It\u2019s not too late to fix this. You could even make it a surprise and learn to finger spell a simple message and send it as a video as a way of showing you\u2019re trying.

Ouch.", "I mean you could've learned some very simple sign language to communicate. Even that would show you put some effort in it. You don't need to be fluent in SL for deaf people to be appreciate the effort you did. \n\nYTA", "YTA I learned some basic signs when I was a checkout operator 23 years ago as we had a fairly regular deaf customer who would hand over a piece of paper to explain. And this is someone your son is with so you see more than I saw that person? You need to know that your son won\u2019t think spending time with you is worth it in the future because it\u2019s too much effort as you aren\u2019t prepared to be inclusive of his life partner.

Her twin basically interpreted for so long no one realised. Luckily as she's aged, technology has improved, but she has always struggled and never been comfortable letting people know she's deaf unless she had to. And by 'had to' I mean she told her watersports instructor several lessons in when he was on the point of firing her for not obeying the safety instructions he was yelling \ud83d\ude48 \nShe's not angry, but I am FURIOUS on her behalf that she was made to think this is such a dreadful thing that has to be hidden. I can see how it has gently warped her life; not because she's deaf, but because people don't know; so they think she's rude and ignoring them. She has literally come out of business meetings and complained (to me) she couldn't hear what was going on, but wasn't able to say anything about it. I was petrified that as she aged, she'd naturally lose the remaining 4%, but luckily the hearing specialist told her last time she's already lost the bit you lose with age. Big relief. To me, signing is not a limitation, it's a signal that you GAF and want to include your child. It's you giving them confidence that being deaf is not something you have to hide. Even if they don't need it, that knowledge that You Don't Want To Hide It must be fricking huge. HUGE."]}
