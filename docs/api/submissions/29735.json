You don't have to let her come to your house.  You certainly don't have to apologize! Tell her mother that is not usual behavior, that you will not tolerate it and that is why the daughter is not invited or welcome at your home.", "Fuck that noise. NTA. \"Fairness\" doesn't include \"inviting property damage into your house with no hope of accountability from responsible parties.\" The mom is ignoring and excusing the issue while making you out to be a villain. Your boundary here is a smart one, and is as fair as can be without leaving yourself open to be a victim. If the mom tries to cry foul, respond with the truth.", "Take pictures of the damage , share them with the other mothers gossiping and ask them if they feel this is ok or would they tolerate this child causing damage to their home.  The other stuff is pretty much kid stuff but the sharpie and any other damage is not acceptable.   I don\u2019t blame you one bit.", "Fuck that noise, indeed. NTA \n\nIf she continues to behave like this and continues trying to make you look like the neighborhood bad guy. Tell her you are more than happy to host her child. As long as she sends a deposit of $350 every time she comes over. The balance of which will be returned minus the cost for any damages\u2026\n\nIgnore the other silly comments. Who the hell sits with eyes peeled over an eight-year-old at all times. Checking in on them frequently is enough. In theory it should be anyway \u2026 They are old enough at that age to have a degree bit of control over themselves.", "NTA, 400 dollars in damage. Holy shit.", "nta, what lack of fairness? it\u2019s fair for you to exclude a child from your home when they consistently cause damage. mom is wild for asking you to apologize. trust me, you are nta.", "NTA - That amount of money in damage is insane. The mother should understand that that behavior is not normal and until she addresses the issue, her kid will not be invited.", "NTA...it's your home and you're allowed to set rules about acceptable behaviours. If the mother doesn't wish to address this, then she'll have to accept the outdoor play dates.", "NTA. You are not being unreasonable, and you don\u2019t need to be \u201cfair\u201d and punish your son or his other friends by not allowing them over. You gave her mom honest reasons and she is choosing to minimize those (huge red flag right there). You are also still making an effort to allow your kids play time together at the park. Other parents are likely having the same issues if this girl is visiting their homes- so don\u2019t worry about the gossip. It will sort itself out in the long run.", "NTA and I would counter her claims with the truth. If someone questions your actions or you overhear comments explain that the child has damaged your house, broken and stolen toys and her mother has done nothing.", "NTA and for the sake of fairness, maybe you should go to her house and take their soap and shampoo :)", "NTA The kid is destructive. I would just tell the kid's Mom that unless her kid can be a good guest she can't come over.", "NTA. 7 and 8 year olds should be old enough to be left alone for short period of time without causing this much destruction. This sounds like intentional bad behaviour enabled by the mom. It seems like this little girl and her mom may have to learn the hard way that when you can't behave, you stop getting invited. She can't be only acting this way at your house.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A child that behaves like that would definitely not be welcome in my house.", "She's being ridiculous. You have zero reason to feel bad about this.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Having a play date shouldn't need a security deposit. The reason she's not invited over anymore is because she has terrible parents.", "As a former teacher, I concur that this child's behavior is far from the norm - as is her mother's.\n\nI wouldn't have her back, either.  If for some reason she had to be in my home, I'd make sure that she was where I could see her at all times.\n\nYou would not have been out of line to send her home after the first incredibly naughty thing that she did, OP.  If this child, or another, causes a big mess again don't hesitate to tell them that their behavior is \"unacceptable and inappropriate,\" and that they would be going home immediately.  You don't have to raise your voice or get raspy with anger, just be firm.\n\nYour child is still young, OP, and you have years of play dates ahead of you.  Don't be afraid of being directive to children in your home, as long as you are pleasant about it.  Kids are accustomed to being given directions by grownups, and just need to know your rules.\n\nDon't worry about this other mother complaining about you - I'm sure that the rest of the community knows about her difficult child already.\n\nNTA", "This a million times over.

Do you not turn around to help other children?", "Do you know if she has done this to other families? You can\u2019t be the only ones who have property destroyed by her", "Why did she have a sharpie? Was that in the bathroom? Were the plants in the bathroom? All of this took place when you were making snacks?\n\nWhy did you let her over again after the first time shit went down?", "I would send her a bill of all the damage she did to your house last time.

She wanted you to apologize to her little shit? Tell the other parents what happened and ban the kid from your house", "NTA. You can explain exactly why it is that the girl is not invited over. It is your house and your stuff getting ruined. If the mother doesn't understand that then she has problems.", "NTA. When you behave badly, you don't get invited back.\n\nAnd can we just retire the argument that...\n\nAll children steal.\nAll men cheat.\nAll boys misbehave.\nAll girls mature faster.\nAll women are asking for it.", "This is your house, your family and your rules, fuck their opinions", "Tell her you'll start inviting her daughter again once the damages and stolen items are paid for.
