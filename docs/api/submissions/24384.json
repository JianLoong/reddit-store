I have a boyfriend \u201cMatt\u201d who I\u2019ve been dating for 7 months.\n\nMy birthday was last week, and I had a dinner party for some friends before we all went out to a club. There was 8 of including Logan and Matt. We had a little bit of a \u201cgift opening\u201d before dessert, and Logan gifted me an old copy of The Great Gatsby. \n\nThe book has a special significance to us, because for many years Logan and I lived in different countries. We kept in contact, but we didn\u2019t see each other in person for about 4 years. We finally got our parents to agree for me to fly to his country to visit in 2013. We were talking about what we were going to do on the visit and I really wanted to go and see The Great Gatsby movie, which had just come out, as it is my favourite book. Logan had never even heard of it, and I said  he had to read it before we went to see the movie. Logan was never academic, and to this day it is the only fiction book he\u2019s ever read all the way through (not counting children\u2019s books). Whenever I ask him to do me a favour he always replies with  \u201cI read The Great Gatsby for you, so I may as well\u201d and it\u2019s a running joke.\n\nWe always go big on birthdays but this book means so much to me. \n\nThe day after, Matt said he felt the book was an inappropriate gift, because of how expensive it is. I tried to explain to him that it\u2019s just a sentimental gift and that the cost isn\u2019t the point, but Matt said he feels weird that another man gifted me something that costs more than his car. This argument went on for a long time and Matt said that he thinks I should return the book, and if it means so much to both of us then Logan can keep it. I told him to grow up.\n\nWe\u2019ve been having this fight on and off for a week. Matt\u2019s saying that it\u2019s reasonable for him to be uncomfortable but I think he\u2019s being a jealous child. It\u2019s not like Logan gave me a giant diamond necklace just to show off, he gave me something heartfelt that means the world to me, and I think that should be more important than the fact that Matt thinks it\u2019s outside what he deems an acceptable budget. \n\nMy mother is saying to give Matt the benefit of the doubt and maybe ask Logan to keep the book for now and if one day Matt is more secure I can take it back. My dad is saying Matt\u2019s an idiot. My girlfriends are split.\n\nThis argument is just dragging on and I\u2019m leaving for my birthday trip tomorrow and I just need some perspective on whether I\u2019m being unreasonable wanting to keep the book?", "created_utc": 1691746881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o4ai5/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_an_expensive_birthday/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I saw you comment elsewhere you would be find if your boyfriend received a similar type gift from a female friend, but I honestly doubt that. It didn\u2019t happen and it is easy for you to just say that versus actually being in that situation.\n\n4. With a gift that expensive, I suspect your friend is making a romantic attempt with you.

So this leaves a few conclusions; Either your friend and yourself are very well off so something like a first edition of this book is nice, but doesn\u2019t break the bank OR just your friend is well off and you\u2019re used to him gifting you these types of things. \n\nBecause based on your reaction the fact that this book potentially cost thousands doesn\u2019t really mean much to you (in a \u201cwow that was a lot of money\u201d kind a way)\n\nEither way I have to assume your boyfriend maybe doesn\u2019t share your financial class and maybe is experiencing insecurity issues because of it.\n\nOr this could all be one made up story \n\nEither way I think you need to communicate with your boyfriend of the root of his issue", "NTA, as you are clearly in a side friendship with Logan, but my question is why is the book so expensive?", "ESH - If this is the first time he\u2019s spent this much money on you, it\u2019s a blatant power move by Logan to make Matt feel insecure and humiliate him in front of your friends, combined with a big romantic gesture. It simultaneously says \u201clook how much money I\u2019m willing to spend on OP\u201d and \u201clook how much closer OP and I are than you are with OP\u201d. If it was about the sentiment, it didn\u2019t have to be a super old copy of the book. \n\nMatt is being insecure and trying to make you return the book as a proxy for seeking assurance you don\u2019t reciprocate Logan\u2019s romantic feelings. He\u2019s not being clear about how he really feels and he\u2019s interpreting your refusal to return the book as a sign that you have feelings for Logan. \n\nYou\u2019re also an AH for making this about just the book and not giving Matt any reassurances about you and Logan. Yes he\u2019s being insecure, but imagine how you\u2019d feel if a close long time female friend of Matt gave him an overtly generous gift in a similar way. Are you telling us you wouldn\u2019t feel threatened in the same way? You don\u2019t have to return the book to give Matt appropriate assurance, and if Logan is a true friend and there\u2019s no romantic feelings on his part, he\u2019d understand and feel bad for making Matt feel bad.", "Girl, I'm sorry, let me make this abundantly clear : one the one hand you have a guy who gifts you a book worth \"more than a car\", and on the other hand a guy you have been with for less than a year who gives you shit about another guy's gift ?\n\nI'm sorry, I'm standing with Matt on this one, the gift is indeed inappropriate because it is indeed inappropriate to one-up a guy in front of his girlfriend in such an merciless and absolute fashion. \n\nOn the other hand, you need to face facts and understand that Logan is into you and girl, I would not hold back if I were you, the guy is a keeper. Sorry for Matt, but it's just no competition.\n\nNTA on the question. YTA if you keep playing blind and don't give Logan the chance he deserves.", "A book, a car, a necklace. Why does that matter? He gives a let's say $1500 present, which is out of proportion and obviously makes the bf feel a bit insecure. Dismissing that is crazy, especially cause you do not know the motives of the old friend. \n\nI mean, would you empty your savings and buy and old friend a super expensive gift, for no other reason than that it 'means a lot to that friend'?", "Sure, but it also is a bit over the top. OP isn't the AH, but I can definitely understand how the bf feels about this. This book likely costs well over $1000, which is not in proportion in this situation.", "There are no indications at all in the post that the bf would damage OP\u2019s property. Wtf?", "Exactly this. His jealousy is concerning. The way the mum says to give it back until the bf is more secure is worrying. It sounds like he has an inferiority complex because he keeps mentioning the cost. Friends of 18 years, trumps a bf of 7 months no matter the gender.", "This makes no sense. Even OP's mom agrees with the bf that the gift is excessive. Should she dump her mother as well?", "Quick search: The first edition casts about 5.000$, about 190.000$ to 240.000$ when it\u2018s signed.\n\nEdit: For clarification: OP never said it was a first edition, only that it was \u201eold\u201c. I don\u2018t think it\u2018s a signed book, that is just for context.", "They know each other, they haven\u2019t spent a lot of time together. Logan isn\u2019t around that much, he travels a lot for work, and he doesn\u2019t really make friends that easily, he and Matt never clicked. They\u2019re very different. Logan is a doer, Matt is a thinker like me. But they get on fine in casual conversation.", "If you're secure in your relationship the sex of the friend shouldn't matter. \nI don't know if it is American thing or not (and yes, I appreciate I'm generalising massively) but from experience I find that friendships are more sex segregated in America than they are in Europe.", "I don\u2019t think I would be bothered. Maybe (and this is a big maybe because I can\u2019t imagine myself caring) if it was something that was super expensive that had no meaning beyond being an over the top gift, I would be a bit like \u201cwhat the motive\u201d. But if it was something that genuinely had meaning in *their* specific relationship, I can\u2019t see myself being bothered no matter what the price was.", "Isn't the main jist of The Great Gatsby about a man attaining wealth just so he could be in the position to receive the love of a girl he had been madly in love with for years? I wouldn't be surprised if there were certain implications in that. I could also be reading too much into it, but books are all for reading into... \ud83d\ude43", "Okay, you are right. I did dismiss Mary\u2019s feelings and I guess what I said wasn\u2019t what I meant. It\u2019s not that I think Matt shouldn\u2019t feel that way, it\u2019s more I think him expecting me to act on the fact he feels that way is petulant. But again, you\u2019re right, I don\u2019t have the right to say he shouldn\u2019t feel a certain way. \n\nBut I highly doubt that after nigh on two decades of being friends, Logan suddenly caught feelings and thought \u201cinstead of saying something, I\u2019m just going to get her a birthday gift and hope that she infers that that is me making a move\u201d. That would be ludicrous.\n\nETA: I said in my comment that obviously I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d react, but I said I can\u2019t *imagine* that it would upset me, which is true. Obviously I don\u2019t know for sure.", ">With a gift that expensive, I suspect\n\nWow, you sure are suspicious.\n\nYou sure seem unaware that people can have and cherish lifelong friendships with those not of the same sex.\n\nIt's worse, actually, as well as childish, for the few-month boynotfriend to be trying to interfere with his date's long term friendship. It's quite inappropriate for him to ask her to return the gift. He's being controlling, possessive of that which is not actually his, even projecting being a cheater himself who hopes to buy his future mistresses with the assets of an easily abused wife. He's not relationship material, along with anyone else who'd see a woman as a possession not a person.", "No, we\u2019ve never dated, hooked up, kissed, anything like that.", "So she isn\u2019t allowed to have had a life with people she loves and cares about before she met him? Because it excludes him? Should she cut her parents off as well then?\n\nRidiculous NTA", "WTH is this post?! What Matt got her is irrelevant to the issue. You make this sound like her having male friends I cheating\u2026 she has not crossed any ethical relationship lines. It\u2019s obvious that her and Matt need to have a conversation. No person should ever have to be forced to pick between long time friends and their partner. That is not a fair or kind choice. And if Matt has sense he will not put the value of a book over his relationship. It\u2019s stupid to break up over a book. There is more to this than just the book.", ">Are you prepared to risk you relationship with Matt over Logan and the book?\n\nOne would certainly hope that the book will remain with the OP and the \"relationship\" with the unfriendly boynotfriend will end uneventfully.\n\nIf you think you could date someone for a few months and then start trying to sabotage their long term friendships and force them to return gifts from people they knew long before you, try learning how to see other people as autonomous humans instead.", "yes?", "Yeah, I absolutely think her friend is making a move on her. I do get my friends gifts occasionally, but not gifts that are several thousand dollars, as OP indicated.", "If I were the boyfriend I would be more uncomfortable with the sentimental value than the price tbh", "Honestly, I don't get your point.\n\nYour comment seems to mean that you can not have meaningful stories or connexions with someone else because they're necessarily romantic or sexual. How do you know that Logan is trying to steal her from Matt? For what we know, Logan could be gay, would your point still stand?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot all friendships are romantically or sexually charged, seriously.", "I\u2019m sorry but I disagree with you about the sentimentality being inappropriate. At the end of the day, I\u2019ve known Matt 7 months. Any experiences I have with anyone I knew before him is going to shut him out. I\u2019ve known Logan most of my life, pretty much everything we know about each other shits everyone else out, simply because they weren\u2019t there. I can\u2019t live my life pretending life before Matt doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nI said this elsewhere but I can\u2019t imagine myself ever getting upset over someone giving Matt a gift that spoke to his friendship with that person. He had a whole life before me, and that should matter to him. I would never be jealous of that. \n\nI don\u2019t want to end my relationship with Matt over the book, obviously. That said, if I give back the book, I worry that next time it\u2019ll be Matt saying he\u2019s uncomfortable with me going x place or doing y thing and then my whole life becomes about his comfort level. A comfort level which I\u2019m already side-eyeing at this point.", "Woah woah woah.\n\nI agree with you on some terms, but to put a 7 MONTH relationship over a nearly 20 YEAR friendship is insane.\n\nWhy is a book an inappropriate birthday present for someone with a boyfriend?\n\nAnd should she never get something that has to do with her past?", "Why are you looking at this based solely on them both having a penis? Would you think it inappropriate if Logan was a woman?\n\nIf OP says there's nothing between her and Logan then it's Matt's problem if he doesn't believe her. Matt has the jealousy issues, and it's him who needs to look at himself and work on them.", "Considering her relationship with Logan is like 20x longer than her one with Matt the answer should definitely be yes. Women are allowed to have close male friends and the only reason to be uncomfortable with this is if you're insecure, controlling and jealous.\n\nLoving someone means wanting what is best for them, and clearly Logan and this book make her happy. Matt should be thrilled that she has such a good friend.", "Ok Matt.", "Because I\u2019m just not? The relationship between Logan and me was always friends and it just just stayed that way. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a big flashing *why* we aren\u2019t together, we just never clicked that way. \n\nIdk what Matt sees. Honestly, I think Matt sees that Logan spent a bunch of money (as Logan does regularly) and thought the price was a big gesture. Whereas I see that Logan had a nice idea of a birthday gift and it just happened to cost what it cost.", "Lmao we\u2019re not even giving Logan the option, just dragging him down the aisle? Love that for me \ud83d\ude05", "Okay well then he is in big trouble because that\u2019s the dumbest way to express your feelings after 18 years, and he\u2019s getting a smack upside the head.", "Well, we were kids when he read it. \n\nBut yeah, I am hella confused. Like, none of this really makes sense to me. I can\u2019t wrap my head around that after 18 years Logan would do something like this as a way to try and express his feelings. Like, I just don\u2019t get and frankly I\u2019d be really mad at him if it that was true. \n\nRe the context of the book, I actually saw this in another comment, and it\u2019s an unfortunate coincidence. That book has been my favourite book since I was about 9. And Logan was born with money anyway (and then made more). \n\nThat\u2019s good advice though. I just feel like if I give back the book I\u2019m committing to a certain type of relationship with Matt. One where his feelings of inadequacy dictate how I live. Does that make sense?", "But he didn\u2019t empty his savings. This is something I said to Matt also. Logan has a lot of money. He spends a lot of money on his family and friends. The cost of the book to him is the same as buying dinner for Matt.", "This is someone who has been in her life for 18 years instead of 7 months. Since it does have a special meaning and he can apparently spare the money, I really don't see why this is not in proportion. \n\nHer boyfriend is totally justified in not liking this, but not in asking her to return it.", "Have you read this sub?", "Her mom doesn't agree, but she tries to mediate. The NF is just being jelly", "Making friends suuuuucks after school. The better and longer Matt has known Logan, the better it will be. \n\nIs there a reason you can give for why you are not into Logan besides his itinerant lifestyle? You\u2019re up against decades of \u201cbest friends make the best relationships.\u201d", "Ok then NTA. But you never know how you would feel until the shoe is on the other foot. My ex used to be that way when we split and immediately started dating. Now she  gone thru five people and is alone and I find myself in a happy place with girl.", "I think you should talk to your boyfriend. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s more about the content of the book? As the book dwells a bit into infidelity he might be instead be concerned about that and isn\u2019t telling you. \n\nYou need to sit down and ask. If you can both have a conversation about it, maybe you\u2019ll find the root is a bit deeper.", "Oof that is *unfortunate* now that I think about it. I mean fair I would read into it too if it hadn\u2019t been my favourite book forever and there wasn\u2019t a whole other meaning to it between us.\n\nBut yeah damn I really wish my favourite book was Animal Farm right now.", "Yes, it is. I didn\u2019t consider that, honestly. It is possible.", "I am a guy and I can just say, we don\u2019t typically buy friends gifts that are several thousand dollars. Also, I can tell you that sometimes we are good at hiding how we feel about someone. So I still think Logan is interested in you romantically and is trying to express that.\n\nI do think you should have an honest conversation with him. He is allowed to feel uncomfortable, so please don\u2019t simply dismiss it as being childish.\n\nI am not saying you have to return the gift, I can\u2019t say I would tell my partner to do that. But I also think you need to reevaluate your relationship with your boyfriend, as you are being incredibly dismissive of his feelings and he deserves better; as well as your relationship with Logan; he clearly crossed boundaries and will likely continue to do so in the future.", "let me ask you this...if you had a brother or sister that gave you a gift like that of that value would matt say the same thing that it is inappropriate?  because you and your friend are like brother and sister that is how deep the friendship is.  but lets face it any man that gives a gift to u he gonna have a tanty over.  and after 7 months you would think your bf understands your friendship", "Two decades is nothing for someone to hold on to hope of unrequited love.", "You're the one in charge of your relationships. You're the one who knows your friends. You also know that Matt is trying to control you and one hopes you also know that you can't tolerate that behavior, and if it's based on fixed false belief, it only gets worse. You can't change someone else, only change with whom you spend time until that time feels and is supportive of your right to make your own decisions.", "He definitely wants to", "You have gifted a platonic friend something worth more than a car?", "A agree. He\u2019s using the price of the book as a crutch for a bigger issue. I would have no shame giving a childhood friend an expensive present, no matter what their partner thought. It\u2019s my friend, and I can give them what ever gift I please! Additionally, if I or my partner was given such a gift, I would hope that motives for the gift would be questioned, but I would hope that we were both secure enough in our relationship that neither of us would feel uncomfortable. That to me would be a conversation that me and my partner would need to have; it wouldn\u2019t involve my friend. If we decided that the book shouldn\u2019t stay at home and that it needed to find a different home, then I would make the appropriate changes.", "Thank you for your OP and your answers.\n\nMatt is far too concerned with your existing friendship and for all the wrong reasons. Anyone who'd expect you to be obligated to alter your friendships, or give up gifts, or do anything you don't want to do and shouldn't have to do, is trying to negate your authority over yourself. Nobody gets to question your autonomy. Find company with someone who respects you as a person.", "I'd say this is important info. If Logan buys his family and other friends expensive things on the common it's not that big a deal. He found the right pressie for you and it just happened to cost what it cost.", "I might sound ignorant, but why does a great Gatsby book cost more than Matt's car (assuming it's your average daily driver car)? Is it a unique edition or something similar?", "Have you ever heard of an old friend around that age(25), giving a let's say $1000-1500 present at a birthday, and people thought it was normal?  The gift costs more than the bf's car, I don't really see how that is proportional? \n\nAlso, out of curiosity..\n\nIf Logan's gf posted here and asked if she was the AH for not being happy her bf spend his savings on giving an long time gf an incredibly expensive gift, how would you react?", "The mother clearly understand the bf's pov. She knows these people a lot better than us, and does not side with the gf. I think that says a lot. If the bf was a jealous jerk, she wouldn't have mediated in this situation", "Ummm. I think it\u2019s always pretty hard to explain why you\u2019re not doing something as opposed to why you are. Our relationship just never developed that way.", "You seem like a reasonable guy, so I\u2019m genuinely asking here, what is the boundary? Money? Because that money is inconsequential to Logan, he\u2019s always had and spent a lot of money. I\u2019m the same. Buying that book to him is the same as Matt buying dinner at an upmarket restaurant. I get if Logan had saved for a year to get the book and it was a massive gesture that had an impact on his disposable income, because then you think why would he go through all that trouble, but this wasn\u2019t that. \n\nLogan\u2019s birthday is in September. Am I going to be having this same fight with Matt because he thinks *I* spent too much on a gift even though it was a tiny portion of my income?", "I am so confused by this take. We\u2019ve been friends 18 years. So in 18 years, or let\u2019s say even in the 6 we\u2019ve lived close to each and been adults, he\u2019s never said a word or even hinted at that, and suddenly instead of saying anything, he buys a birthday gift that he hopes will what? Subliminally tell me that he is trying to make a move?\n\nGenuinely asking, is this a thing that men do or think will work? I would be so annoyed by this.", "Agreed. This gets to the crux of the problem and allows the couple to communicate clearly.", "I haven't, but apparently he had the money. He and the boyfriend probably have a very different economic background. \n\nIf he would have emptied out his savings, his girlfriend does have reason to be upset. But they are only dating, so she has no say in how he spends his money. Especially if they've only been dating for 7 months, like OP.", "This is my issue with it. People can claim they would react another way, but they aren\u2019t actually in that situation.", "Your non sequiturs aside, at what if any point do you consider what the adult woman prefers, which is to keep a meaningful gift she received from a long term friend? Why do you believe that someone dated for a few months should be able to force her to return a gift, thus insulting her friend, and giving up something she'd rather keep?", "And her dad also knows her, yet thinks bf is being an idiot which says just as much \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Okay, so I am leaning towards it is a financial thing. Matt probably thinks that he can\u2019t basically show you the same financial affection that Logan can, and that anything he does will be overshadowed by your friend. You probably come from a higher financial status than you boyfriend and he probably feels insecure that he can\u2019t do the things that people you usually are around can afford to do.\n\nI think it is possible this will come up again in September, I don\u2019t know your boyfriend, but based off this post, I suspect it will come up again.\n\nYou should have a serious conversation with your boyfriend because from his perspective, he probably views this that Logan and you are shifting towards a relationship and he will be dumped when you two are satisfied with where you are at.\n\nEDIT: I also just want to clarify: I don\u2019t thinks anyone here is a bad person, except possibly Logan if he is indeed trying to put a wedge in your relationship. I think between you and your boyfriend there has been high levels of miscommunication and hurt feelings overruling a serious conversation. I also think that you and him view things like this differently and having a conversation from your perspective and his perspective will help you both understand each other. He sees something that expensive as an expression of romantic intention.", "I would also just like to say, I don\u2019t like that Reddit always jumps to \u201cdump him\u201d. There are absolutely times where someone is controlling or abusive and they should leave. But people are also allowed to have boundaries or feel uncomfortable by a situation. And sometimes people overreact in the heat of a moment and say something they shouldn\u2019t.\n\nIt makes us human. You will have fights with any romantic partner at some point. Having maturity to separate someone from being upset versus controlling is important. But having a serious level headed discussion to clear the air may fix this.", "Paying thousands I assume for a gift for just a friend is hard to believe. Why don\u2019t you just ask him?

You have to sort it out or your relationship will end and all your future ones because that\u2019s not really an appropriate gift"]}
