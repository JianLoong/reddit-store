I have a boyfriend \u201cMatt\u201d who I\u2019ve been dating for 7 months.\n\nMy birthday was last week, and I had a dinner party for some friends before we all went out to a club. There was 8 of including Logan and Matt. We had a little bit of a \u201cgift opening\u201d before dessert, and Logan gifted me an old copy of The Great Gatsby. \n\nThe book has a special significance to us, because for many years Logan and I lived in different countries. We kept in contact, but we didn\u2019t see each other in person for about 4 years. We finally got our parents to agree for me to fly to his country to visit in 2013. We were talking about what we were going to do on the visit and I really wanted to go and see The Great Gatsby movie, which had just come out, as it is my favourite book. Logan had never even heard of it, and I said  he had to read it before we went to see the movie. Logan was never academic, and to this day it is the only fiction book he\u2019s ever read all the way through (not counting children\u2019s books). Whenever I ask him to do me a favour he always replies with  \u201cI read The Great Gatsby for you, so I may as well\u201d and it\u2019s a running joke.\n\nWe always go big on birthdays but this book means so much to me. \n\nThe day after, Matt said he felt the book was an inappropriate gift, because of how expensive it is. I tried to explain to him that it\u2019s just a sentimental gift and that the cost isn\u2019t the point, but Matt said he feels weird that another man gifted me something that costs more than his car. This argument went on for a long time and Matt said that he thinks I should return the book, and if it means so much to both of us then Logan can keep it. I told him to grow up.\n\nWe\u2019ve been having this fight on and off for a week. Matt\u2019s saying that it\u2019s reasonable for him to be uncomfortable but I think he\u2019s being a jealous child. It\u2019s not like Logan gave me a giant diamond necklace just to show off, he gave me something heartfelt that means the world to me, and I think that should be more important than the fact that Matt thinks it\u2019s outside what he deems an acceptable budget. \n\nMy mother is saying to give Matt the benefit of the doubt and maybe ask Logan to keep the book for now and if one day Matt is more secure I can take it back. My dad is saying Matt\u2019s an idiot. My girlfriends are split.\n\nThis argument is just dragging on and I\u2019m leaving for my birthday trip tomorrow and I just need some perspective on whether I\u2019m being unreasonable wanting to keep the book?", "created_utc": 1691746881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o4ai5/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_an_expensive_birthday/", "score": 1343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should also feel comfortable keeping the book because it\u2019s a memory you share with your friend. Talk to Matt. Calling him a child over his feelings is snobbish. There is obviously something wrong in his view that makes him uncomfortable and jealous of your relationship with Logan. You need to get to the root of the problem.

Keep the book (good insurance policy if nothing else) but I can totally see where your bf is coming from and his feelings are valid.  He is insecure in your relationship.

You make a comment that the book costs more than your BF\u2019s car; clearly there is a financial dynamic that your boyfriend is uncomfortable with. I would guess the book was several thousand dollars.\n\n2. You completely dismiss why your boyfriend is uncomfortable and just told him he was childish. Rather than discussing why he feels that way you justified it.\n\n3. I saw you comment elsewhere you would be find if your boyfriend received a similar type gift from a female friend, but I honestly doubt that. It didn\u2019t happen and it is easy for you to just say that versus actually being in that situation.\n\n4. With a gift that expensive, I suspect your friend is making a romantic attempt with you. Your boyfriend is seeing this and your reaction is exacerbating his concern.", "I just did a quick search of what a 1st edition copy would go for and I'm seeing numbers between 100 and 300K. I mean... That's insanity. Even if it wasn't a first edition... More than his car? So multiple thousands of dollars? I think YTA for dismissing your BF's feelings. I don't think you need to return the gift, but saying something like \"I understand how this might look to you\" rather than \"grow up and get over it\" would probably go a long way to helping you all move through this.", "Have you and Logan been together before? If so it\u2019s definitely inappropriate and if not then it\u2019s still inappropriate because he clearly has motives beyond just being friends.

So this leaves a few conclusions; Either your friend and yourself are very well off so something like a first edition of this book is nice, but doesn\u2019t break the bank OR just your friend is well off and you\u2019re used to him gifting you these types of things. \n\nBecause based on your reaction the fact that this book potentially cost thousands doesn\u2019t really mean much to you (in a \u201cwow that was a lot of money\u201d kind a way)\n\nEither way I have to assume your boyfriend maybe doesn\u2019t share your financial class and maybe is experiencing insecurity issues because of it.\n\nOr this could all be one made up story \n\nEither way I think you need to communicate with your boyfriend of the root of his issue", "NTA, as you are clearly in a side friendship with Logan, but my question is why is the book so expensive?", "ESH - If this is the first time he\u2019s spent this much money on you, it\u2019s a blatant power move by Logan to make Matt feel insecure and humiliate him in front of your friends, combined with a big romantic gesture. It simultaneously says \u201clook how much money I\u2019m willing to spend on OP\u201d and \u201clook how much closer OP and I are than you are with OP\u201d. If it was about the sentiment, it didn\u2019t have to be a super old copy of the book. \n\nMatt is being insecure and trying to make you return the book as a proxy for seeking assurance you don\u2019t reciprocate Logan\u2019s romantic feelings. He\u2019s not being clear about how he really feels and he\u2019s interpreting your refusal to return the book as a sign that you have feelings for Logan. \n\nYou\u2019re also an AH for making this about just the book and not giving Matt any reassurances about you and Logan. Yes he\u2019s being insecure, but imagine how you\u2019d feel if a close long time female friend of Matt gave him an overtly generous gift in a similar way. Are you telling us you wouldn\u2019t feel threatened in the same way? You don\u2019t have to return the book to give Matt appropriate assurance, and if Logan is a true friend and there\u2019s no romantic feelings on his part, he\u2019d understand and feel bad for making Matt feel bad.", "Girl, I'm sorry, let me make this abundantly clear : one the one hand you have a guy who gifts you a book worth \"more than a car\", and on the other hand a guy you have been with for less than a year who gives you shit about another guy's gift ?\n\nI'm sorry, I'm standing with Matt on this one, the gift is indeed inappropriate because it is indeed inappropriate to one-up a guy in front of his girlfriend in such an merciless and absolute fashion. \n\nOn the other hand, you need to face facts and understand that Logan is into you and girl, I would not hold back if I were you, the guy is a keeper. Sorry for Matt, but it's just no competition.\n\nNTA on the question. YTA if you keep playing blind and don't give Logan the chance he deserves.", "A book, a car, a necklace. Why does that matter? He gives a let's say $1500 present, which is out of proportion and obviously makes the bf feel a bit insecure.

Maybe (and this is a big maybe because I can\u2019t imagine myself caring) if it was something that was super expensive that had no meaning beyond being an over the top gift, I would be a bit like \u201cwhat the motive\u201d.

That would be ludicrous.\n\nETA: I said in my comment that obviously I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d react, but I said I can\u2019t *imagine* that it would upset me, which is true.

It's quite inappropriate for him to ask her to return the gift. He's being controlling, possessive of that which is not actually his, even projecting being a cheater himself who hopes to buy his future mistresses with the assets of an easily abused wife.

You make this sound like her having male friends I cheating\u2026 she has not crossed any ethical relationship lines. It\u2019s obvious that her and Matt need to have a conversation. No person should ever have to be forced to pick between long time friends and their partner. That is not a fair or kind choice.

He had a whole life before me, and that should matter to him. I would never be jealous of that. \n\nI don\u2019t want to end my relationship with Matt over the book, obviously. That said, if I give back the book, I worry that next time it\u2019ll be Matt saying he\u2019s uncomfortable with me going x place or doing y thing and then my whole life becomes about his comfort level.

Would you think it inappropriate if Logan was a woman?\n\nIf OP says there's nothing between her and Logan then it's Matt's problem if he doesn't believe her. Matt has the jealousy issues, and it's him who needs to look at himself and work on them.", "Considering her relationship with Logan is like 20x longer than her one with Matt the answer should definitely be yes. Women are allowed to have close male friends and the only reason to be uncomfortable with this is if you're insecure, controlling and jealous.\n\nLoving someone means wanting what is best for them, and clearly Logan and this book make her happy.

Does that make sense?", "But he didn\u2019t empty his savings. This is something I said to Matt also. Logan has a lot of money. He spends a lot of money on his family and friends. The cost of the book to him is the same as buying dinner for Matt.", "This is someone who has been in her life for 18 years instead of 7 months.

I didn\u2019t consider that, honestly. It is possible.", "I am a guy and I can just say, we don\u2019t typically buy friends gifts that are several thousand dollars. Also, I can tell you that sometimes we are good at hiding how we feel about someone. So I still think Logan is interested in you romantically and is trying to express that.\n\nI do think you should have an honest conversation with him. He is allowed to feel uncomfortable, so please don\u2019t simply dismiss it as being childish.\n\nI am not saying you have to return the gift, I can\u2019t say I would tell my partner to do that. But I also think you need to reevaluate your relationship with your boyfriend, as you are being incredibly dismissive of his feelings and he deserves better; as well as your relationship with Logan; he clearly crossed boundaries and will likely continue to do so in the future.", "let me ask you this...if you had a brother or sister that gave you a gift like that of that value would matt say the same thing that it is inappropriate?  because you and your friend are like brother and sister that is how deep the friendship is.  but lets face it any man that gives a gift to u he gonna have a tanty over.  and after 7 months you would think your bf understands your friendship", "Two decades is nothing for someone to hold on to hope of unrequited love.", "You're the one in charge of your relationships.

It\u2019s my friend, and I can give them what ever gift I please! Additionally, if I or my partner was given such a gift, I would hope that motives for the gift would be questioned, but I would hope that we were both secure enough in our relationship that neither of us would feel uncomfortable. That to me would be a conversation that me and my partner would need to have; it wouldn\u2019t involve my friend.

Anyone who'd expect you to be obligated to alter your friendships, or give up gifts, or do anything you don't want to do and shouldn't have to do, is trying to negate your authority over yourself. Nobody gets to question your autonomy. Find company with someone who respects you as a person.", "I'd say this is important info.

Is it a unique edition or something similar?", "Have you ever heard of an old friend around that age(25), giving a let's say $1000-1500 present at a birthday, and people thought it was normal?  The gift costs more than the bf's car, I don't really see how that is proportional? \n\nAlso, out of curiosity..\n\nIf Logan's gf posted here and asked if she was the AH for not being happy her bf spend his savings on giving an long time gf an incredibly expensive gift, how would you react?", "The mother clearly understand the bf's pov.

Our relationship just never developed that way.", "You seem like a reasonable guy, so I\u2019m genuinely asking here, what is the boundary? Money? Because that money is inconsequential to Logan, he\u2019s always had and spent a lot of money. I\u2019m the same. Buying that book to him is the same as Matt buying dinner at an upmarket restaurant. I get if Logan had saved for a year to get the book and it was a massive gesture that had an impact on his disposable income, because then you think why would he go through all that trouble, but this wasn\u2019t that. \n\nLogan\u2019s birthday is in September.

Subliminally tell me that he is trying to make a move?\n\nGenuinely asking, is this a thing that men do or think will work? I would be so annoyed by this.", "Agreed. This gets to the crux of the problem and allows the couple to communicate clearly.", "I haven't, but apparently he had the money. He and the boyfriend probably have a very different economic background. \n\nIf he would have emptied out his savings, his girlfriend does have reason to be upset. But they are only dating, so she has no say in how he spends his money. Especially if they've only been dating for 7 months, like OP.", "This is my issue with it. People can claim they would react another way, but they aren\u2019t actually in that situation.", "Your non sequiturs aside, at what if any point do you consider what the adult woman prefers, which is to keep a meaningful gift she received from a long term friend?

I think between you and your boyfriend there has been high levels of miscommunication and hurt feelings overruling a serious conversation.

They are both speaking from experience in a marriage that in this case a woman may need to take a step back while a man should just stfu after saying your feelings and making no demands cuz no good can come of it and you\u2019re accusing your gf if you push the subject. \n\nIt seems like maybe Logan could\u2019ve resolved a lot of this by talking to Matt ahead of time about the friendship and an opportunity to buy a nice gift (first edition in a bookshop or whatever) and he hopes Matt is cool with it cuz it\u2019s a bit bigger than a standard one. Big thing here is these folks are still pretty young so it\u2019s not a surprise that there\u2019s a gap in understanding gift-giving dynamics. \n\nHopefully everyone grows a bit and Matt can see some perspective about his new gf and their faith in each other.", "how long until we get the post that she dumped her boyfriend based on these peoples opinions and then started to date the 'good friend' who was always there... cause remember hes hooked, he already read the book for her, now he will do anything. shes not gonna give that up for someone else. both dudes are cooked here lol\n\nesh", "Info: Why are saying you have a \u201cboyfriend\u201d Matt.\u201d ?

If you're not serious then don't worry about it.\n\nMy hunch is Matt is likely more concerned about the emotional connection the book represents or says about you and Logan. That's tough for any significant other to deal with. I know it isn't popular here but I don't believe men and women can be close friends . Whether people admit it or not at some point in a close friendship one of the two often develops feelings for the other.\n\nIf the situation were reversed and Matt had this close connection with a woman who he flew to other countries to see, spent time with alone, talked to on the phone or at work, Matt would be metaphorically hung and everyone would say he is having an emotional affair with her.\n\nOnly you know what or who is more valuable to your life.

It is absolutely unreasonable for a friend to put themselves in financial distress for a birthday gift for me. I think you're trying to say that this is normal gifting in your circle but unless you're from an extremely wealthy background this isn't normal gifting. If you and Logan are extremely wealthy not then I would consider Y T A or mild E S H because you shouldn't let your friend do something so grand and questioning their motives in this scenario isn't completely unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is right. Keep the book.", "Listen to dad on this one 100%. Not even close to being unreasonable on keeping the book.", "NTA, but I think as others have said, you have to consider the implications of such a gift.\n\nI actually don't find the bf's jealousy unreasonable. Sure, jealousy isn't healthy but you've only been together 7 months but friends with this other dude since you were kids.\n\nSo I can understand how the bf might take that gift as threatening when it \"means so much\" to you. The kind of gift this guy gave you I think reasonably pushes the boundaries of being overly sentimental to the point of potentially romantic (assuming his potential hidden feelings)\n\nBut even if he doesn't intend anything by it, which I honestly kind of doubt because of how expensive it is, your bf's insecurity here is still actually your concern. \n\nIf the same thing happened where some girl in his life he has been friends with gives him a deep and meaningful gift that is also very expensive, maybe you would feel as awkwardly jealous about it as well. Or maybe not, but I think a lot of people reasonably would. I probably would.\n\nSo whether you should keep the book is up to you, but you need to sit and communicate and negotiate with your bf about this. Don't fight. Don't try to win. Try to be fair to his feelings and fair to yours while considering whether this friend really might have some other feelings going on. \n\nIf it were me, I would *never* give a gift like that to a female friend that I wasn't either really into or straight up in love with. And it may even be as innocent as not intending to win you over, but rather just express those feelings.
