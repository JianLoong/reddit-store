{"id": 24384, "submission_id": "15o4ai5", "title": "AITA for wanting to keep an expensive birthday gift that makes my boyfriend uncomfortable?", "selftext": "I (F just turned 25) have a friend, \u201cLogan\u201d (M25), and we\u2019ve been friends since we were 7/8. I have a boyfriend \u201cMatt\u201d who I\u2019ve been dating for 7 months.\n\nMy birthday was last week, and I had a dinner party for some friends before we all went out to a club. There was 8 of including Logan and Matt. We had a little bit of a \u201cgift opening\u201d before dessert, and Logan gifted me an old copy of The Great Gatsby. \n\nThe book has a special significance to us, because for many years Logan and I lived in different countries. We kept in contact, but we didn\u2019t see each other in person for about 4 years. We finally got our parents to agree for me to fly to his country to visit in 2013. We were talking about what we were going to do on the visit and I really wanted to go and see The Great Gatsby movie, which had just come out, as it is my favourite book. Logan had never even heard of it, and I said  he had to read it before we went to see the movie. Logan was never academic, and to this day it is the only fiction book he\u2019s ever read all the way through (not counting children\u2019s books). Whenever I ask him to do me a favour he always replies with  \u201cI read The Great Gatsby for you, so I may as well\u201d and it\u2019s a running joke.\n\nWe always go big on birthdays but this book means so much to me. \n\nThe day after, Matt said he felt the book was an inappropriate gift, because of how expensive it is. I tried to explain to him that it\u2019s just a sentimental gift and that the cost isn\u2019t the point, but Matt said he feels weird that another man gifted me something that costs more than his car. This argument went on for a long time and Matt said that he thinks I should return the book, and if it means so much to both of us then Logan can keep it. I told him to grow up.\n\nWe\u2019ve been having this fight on and off for a week. Matt\u2019s saying that it\u2019s reasonable for him to be uncomfortable but I think he\u2019s being a jealous child. It\u2019s not like Logan gave me a giant diamond necklace just to show off, he gave me something heartfelt that means the world to me, and I think that should be more important than the fact that Matt thinks it\u2019s outside what he deems an acceptable budget. \n\nMy mother is saying to give Matt the benefit of the doubt and maybe ask Logan to keep the book for now and if one day Matt is more secure I can take it back. My dad is saying Matt\u2019s an idiot. My girlfriends are split.\n\nThis argument is just dragging on and I\u2019m leaving for my birthday trip tomorrow and I just need some perspective on whether I\u2019m being unreasonable wanting to keep the book?\n\nEDIT. \n\nFor everyone asking about the book, it is a 1925 edition, well known to be fairly rare. The prices vary but it\u2019s Google-able if you really want to know. There are a range of prices and it\u2019s somewhere in the middle, I\u2019m not going to say the exact amount.\n\nFor everyone asking why I\u2019m not dating Logan or why I never did, I explained this in detail in several comments but this is the most comprehensive and reflective one I think \n\n*There was a YouTube segment of Olivia Coleman and Emilia Clarke having tea together. And Olivia said her \u201cwhat\u2019s your favourite item in your wardrobe\u201d or something similar, and she said \u201ca beautiful chanel cardigan that I really love but have never worn because it just doesn\u2019t suit me\u201d. And it just reminded me of that. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t absolutely adore Logan, I do. I can unreservedly say he\u2019s my favourite person in the whole world. But if you ask me why I\u2019m not in relationship with him, I don\u2019t have a concrete answer, because there\u2019s nothing about him I don\u2019t like, but it just never happened. And I think he would say the same thing. When I think of the way he was with his ex and the ones I\u2019ve had, including Matt, I don\u2019t see us being that way/those people for each other*", "created_utc": 1691746881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o4ai5/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_an_expensive_birthday/", "score": 5293, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should also feel comfortable keeping the book because it\u2019s a memory you share with your friend. Talk to Matt. Calling him a child over his feelings is snobbish.

You make a comment that the book costs more than your BF\u2019s car; clearly there is a financial dynamic that your boyfriend is uncomfortable with.

He is allowed to feel uncomfortable, so please don\u2019t simply dismiss it as being childish.\n\nI am not saying you have to return the gift, I can\u2019t say I would tell my partner to do that.

It\u2019s my friend, and I can give them what ever gift I please! Additionally, if I or my partner was given such a gift, I would hope that motives for the gift would be questioned, but I would hope that we were both secure enough in our relationship that neither of us would feel uncomfortable.

Anyone who'd expect you to be obligated to alter your friendships, or give up gifts, or do anything you don't want to do and shouldn't have to do, is trying to negate your authority over yourself. Nobody gets to question your autonomy. Find company with someone who respects you as a person.", "I'd say this is important info.

The gift costs more than the bf's car, I don't really see how that is proportional? \n\nAlso, out of curiosity..\n\nIf Logan's gf posted here and asked if she was the AH for not being happy her bf spend his savings on giving an long time gf an incredibly expensive gift, how would you react?", "The mother clearly understand the bf's pov.

Because that money is inconsequential to Logan, he\u2019s always had and spent a lot of money. I\u2019m the same. Buying that book to him is the same as Matt buying dinner at an upmarket restaurant. I get if Logan had saved for a year to get the book and it was a massive gesture that had an impact on his disposable income, because then you think why would he go through all that trouble, but this wasn\u2019t that. \n\nLogan\u2019s birthday is in September.

This gets to the crux of the problem and allows the couple to communicate clearly.", "I haven't, but apparently he had the money. He and the boyfriend probably have a very different economic background. \n\nIf he would have emptied out his savings, his girlfriend does have reason to be upset.

I think between you and your boyfriend there has been high levels of miscommunication and hurt feelings overruling a serious conversation.

I think Matt can chill a bit and maybe use his words more but his feelings are valid because he\u2019s new-ish and such a grand and personal gift can get alienating especially knowing the history of the relationship. OP probably sees the friendship like any other but we know socially that\u2019s not really ever the case and she will unfortunately have to remember that with any BF down the line. Mom and Dad crack me up. They are both speaking from experience in a marriage that in this case a woman may need to take a step back while a man should just stfu after saying your feelings and making no demands cuz no good can come of it and you\u2019re accusing your gf if you push the subject. \n\nIt seems like maybe Logan could\u2019ve resolved a lot of this by talking to Matt ahead of time about the friendship and an opportunity to buy a nice gift (first edition in a bookshop or whatever) and he hopes Matt is cool with it cuz it\u2019s a bit bigger than a standard one. Big thing here is these folks are still pretty young so it\u2019s not a surprise that there\u2019s a gap in understanding gift-giving dynamics. \n\nHopefully everyone grows a bit and Matt can see some perspective about his new gf and their faith in each other.", "how long until we get the post that she dumped her boyfriend based on these peoples opinions and then started to date the 'good friend' who was always there... cause remember hes hooked, he already read the book for her, now he will do anything. shes not gonna give that up for someone else. both dudes are cooked here lol\n\nesh", "Info: Why are saying you have a \u201cboyfriend\u201d Matt.\u201d ?

Whether people admit it or not at some point in a close friendship one of the two often develops feelings for the other.\n\nIf the situation were reversed and Matt had this close connection with a woman who he flew to other countries to see, spent time with alone, talked to on the phone or at work, Matt would be metaphorically hung and everyone would say he is having an emotional affair with her.\n\nOnly you know what or who is more valuable to your life.

Sure, jealousy isn't healthy but you've only been together 7 months but friends with this other dude since you were kids.\n\nSo I can understand how the bf might take that gift as threatening when it \"means so much\" to you. The kind of gift this guy gave you I think reasonably pushes the boundaries of being overly sentimental to the point of potentially romantic (assuming his potential hidden feelings)\n\nBut even if he doesn't intend anything by it, which I honestly kind of doubt because of how expensive it is, your bf's insecurity here is still actually your concern. \n\nIf the same thing happened where some girl in his life he has been friends with gives him a deep and meaningful gift that is also very expensive, maybe you would feel as awkwardly jealous about it as well. Or maybe not, but I think a lot of people reasonably would. I probably would.\n\nSo whether you should keep the book is up to you, but you need to sit and communicate and negotiate with your bf about this. Don't fight. Don't try to win. Try to be fair to his feelings and fair to yours while considering whether this friend really might have some other feelings going on. \n\nIf it were me, I would *never* give a gift like that to a female friend that I wasn't either really into or straight up in love with.

There is so much history and nostalgia between them that he has a plethora of thoughtful gifts he could buy OP. Logan has most guys beat financially and emotionally when it comes to gift giving. Isn\u2019t it kind of sus that Logan, a guy who never reads, suddenly reads a book in his teenage years because OP (a girl) said so? Logan read the book to attract OP. That\u2019s a textbook play from \u201chow to get a girl 101\u201d. At one point, Logan was in love with OP.

In front of your so called boyfriend.\n\nUtterly YTA.", "This is just the plot of The Great Gatsby", "ESH.\n\nYou are *completely* ignoring (along with all the comments I\u2019ve seen so far) the exact nature of the sentimentality of the gift, and one of the primary themes of the book itself. And I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s really important.\n\nHe read this book - FOR YOU. He did something he hated - FOR YOU. \n\nA central theme of the book is the torch that Jay Gatsby carried, and continues to carry, for the now-married Daisy. Many (most? all?) of his actions, are done - FOR DAISY. \n\nLogan making this a recurring touchstone and referring to it so frequently in your relationship; him gifting you this book specifically with its characters and themes, *is him confessing to you*. To borrow from another piece of fiction, this is Logan\u2019s \u201cas you wish.\u201d (\u201cAnd Buttercup realized, that what Westley *really* meant, was \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d) Logan sees himself as Jay (regardless of the exact nature of your previous relationship) and you are his Daisy. You are the one that got away. A person who hates reading fiction doesn\u2019t latch onto this book in this way unless it REALLY AND TRULY resonates with them (and/or they are trying hard to impress someone.)\n\nI don\u2019t often feel things in my bones - I accept that everyone is different, and there is often nuance in situations and actions, and that the same two actions coming from two different people carry different significance because of their intent. But I KNOW IN MY BONES that Logan has big feelings for you. Like, jewelry or a car is also possibly an inappropriate gift, but this gift is (in my opinion) inappropriate not because of the cost, but because of the messages of this specific book. This isn\u2019t like, Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide, or Catcher in the Rye - books that are funny or speak to other pretty universal themes. This is a story about a man who is desperate for the approval of the woman he loves (which, again, is not really a story most people will enjoy or reference so often unless it strikes a chord; certainly not someone who generally hates reading fiction.)\n\nNow, I have ZERO idea what your feelings are for Logan, and whether you\u2019ve been purposely obtuse, or if this is truly a shock to you. I\u2019m not here to judge whether you\u2019ve been ethical in your dealings with Logan up to this point, because I know how hard it can be to see things when you\u2019re in the middle of them; and I\u2019m willing to give full benefit of the doubt and assume you have just never seen it before (but if he has ACTUALLY ever confessed feelings for you before and you simply ignored them, I\u2019d have something different to say here.) But I AM saying you need to sit your ass down and think long and hard about how YOU truly feel about Logan, and try to navigate this in the most ethical way possible going forward. If you don\u2019t have feelings for Logan, then I think returning the book is appropriate, because the book itself is a message. If you DO realize you have feelings for Logan, then you have to do the right thing by Matt, because no one deserves to be in a relationship with someone who cares for someone else. If not, YTA.\n\nMatt sucks because he\u2019s being slightly controlling because he probably doesn\u2019t know how to properly communicate his (from my point of view) valid discomfort about this specific gift. It\u2019s easier to focus on the cost than it is to effectively communicate that it\u2019s a little sus that a dude who doesn\u2019t even like reading spent all this money on a book about unrequited love. \n\nAnd Logan sucks a little bit too. Partially for not coming out and actually expressing himself like a big boy, and partially for trying to meddle - however subtly - in your relationship. I\u2019m not even saying that it\u2019s intentional. It very probably isn\u2019t. But he\u2019s trying to win you over in his way, trying to speak to you in a language he thinks you understand, and that\u2019s not entirely okay when he knows you\u2019re in a relationship. The time to have these discussions, or perform these grand gestures, is when you are NOT in a relationship.", "Nta \n\nI think a further conversation about feelings should be had.

I can go on Amazon and find people selling the book for like $10.\n\nIf the gift was supposed to be \"purely sentimental\", Logan could have easily got a copy of the book that wasn't crazy expensive.\n\nAlso, the main theme of Great Gatsby is **literally** unrequited love.

Look at all the lengths that Jay Gatsby goes to in order to \"prove\" he is good enough for Daisy?\n\nLogan absolutely has a crush on OP (OP is Logan's \"Daisy\"), and Logan purposefully chose the most expensive version of the book he could find so he could flex his \"wealth\" (just like how Jay Gatsby loves to flaunt his wealthy lifestyle in the book). And Logan is trying to drive a wedge between OP and Matt, so she will leave Matt and run right into his open arms (Matt is like Daisy's husband, \"Tom\").\n\nI mean, holy fuck, this situation is so on the nose, it isn't even funny.\n\nIf I were Matt, I would 100% be feeling insecure about this, because I know how the plot of the Great Gatsby goes.

To late for that now though, damage is done and really wouldn't blame Matt for breaking up with you and not wasting his own time with a woman that doesn't know what she wants and can't respect the fact that PEOPLE DO GET JEALOUS.

However I\u2019m going to play \u201cdevils advocate\u201d here for a sec. Your boyfriend does kinda have a reason to worry a little. First birthday with your bday, and your old friend decides to drop thousands onto a gift for you. While that alone isn\u2019t weird, to some guys, they see that as competition. Like Logan was trying to outdo Matt. \n\nSecond, it is a little strange about how a book about a man being obsessed with a lady for a long time, and wanting to be her husband. Since you know the book so well, think of it like this. \n\nLogan is Gatsby, Tom is Matt, and Daisy is you. Gatsby and Daisy knew eachother for a while, however never were able to get together despite the fact they probably love eachother. There are some parallels here between the book and this scenario, and the fact this specific story is so special for you and Logan, I can see why Matt would be a little uncomfortable there\n\nYour final portion also can seem a little concerning for a new boyfriend as well. You pretty much state that there is no reasons why you guys haven\u2019t dated, including the fact he\u2019s your favorite person in the whole world. Matt probably wonders where he ranks in your life then. \n\nNo one here is an asshole but I think there should be conversations opened up to determine what boundaries are acceptable for you and for Matt. In a relationship you have to be able to compromise, and if you guys can\u2019t, it could be a deal breaker.", "NTA about wanting to keep the book. It is yours. No reasonable partner would expect you to give up a precious gift. However, you might want to reflect on this situation for the sake of your current relationship and possibly future ones.\n\nYour partner is acting childish. If this happened to my partner, I would be extremely happy for them. If gifts were enough to sway someone, you would have been in a relationship with Logan and not him. \n\nSome unsolicited advice:\n\nFirst, address your partner's emotions. He is insecure about this specific situation, but you must communicate with him about the deeper issue. What is the root of his insecurity? Is it something you can help support him with and move on from as a couple? Although you should keep the book, I think you should also reassure him of your fidelity and feelings.\n\nAlso, please consider his financial situation and upbringing. You seem to have wealthy friends and live a lavish lifestyle, at least when it comes to birthdays. He may feel left out or unfamiliar with this. It takes some adjusting on his part, but also compassion, awareness, and empathy on your part. Even if you are used to big gifts and think nothing of it, he may have a different perspective.\n\nSecond, consider changing your traditions. You love to do your birthdays big and that's amazing! However, an opening ceremony can breed resentment and insecurity since it is an environment where all gifts can be compared. Maybe you should make it more private, like a one-on-one exchange or by yourself. This would prevent similar conflicts.\n\nLastly, please keep in mind how you speak to your partner. While you aren't TA for keeping the book, you are TA for how you speak/think about Matt. Is \"jealous child\" really the way you view someone you love? How is the phrase \"grow up\" meant to make him feel?", "I\u2019m leaning NAH primarily because of OPs update (the Olivia Clark analogy). I get what she is saying, but one thing that isn\u2019t clear is the potential that Logan has unrequited love for OP. She even admits she *thinks* he views her the same way. That is way different than knowing you\u2019re \u201cjust friends\u201d. It\u2019s not uncommon for those with unrequited love to not speak up for many years, always relying on what they feel are safe subtle hints they attempt to drop, yet can easily back-pedal away from should their feelings be shot down. As for dad, he may be smart or maybe he just likes Logan and hopes some day Logan will make a move on OP. \n\nI see both OPs point, but I can also see where Matt is coming from.
