{"id": 21631, "submission_id": "14tnqpz", "title": "AITA for blowing up at my daughter for not calling us and being rude about it? Or is what I'm asking too much to ask for?", "selftext": "My daughter (26F) moved out almost 10 months ago. At first, she called back home frequently---every day then dwindling down to 1x/week. Although we text in-between calls (even then she sometimes doesn't respond or goes days without texting), she has settled into calling nearly every two weeks. There was one period when she didn't call for an entire month. That block of silence only ended when we stumbled upon each other when we happened to go to the same park one day.\n\nHer last call was a week ago when she was driving. She knows we don't like to talk when she's driving for her safety. Even if it's through car speaker, we want her to focus. Last time we saw each other in person was Father's Day.\n\nFunnily though, she seems to talk to her brother more often. I often walk by his bedroom and hear them on FaceTime calls and the like.\n\nToday, they were talking on the phone and my wife came in. I walked in soon after. My wife, who obviously hadn't heard from my daughter in a while, said (in an obviously playful, pretend-whiny voice), \"You never call your parents anymore? You don't want to talk to your old parents anymore?\"\n\nMy daughter took it much more seriously and asked, \"Oh, did you call?\", but I know she was baiting. My wife, still joking: \"No, I didn't call recently but we haven't heard from you!\" Then my daughter said, \"The phone works both ways.\"\n\nMy wife's face fell; I lost it, after so many months of patience. My wife is still grieving the mother she lost last year...still coming to terms with her toxic family upbringing in the midst of grief...still having mysterious health issues. All she wants to do is hear from her daughter. To me, she is being selfishly inconsiderate and says something cruel like to her parents who love her more than anything or anyone.\n\nI don't know if it's a guy, if she's so caught up in her new friends (who, at the end of the day, will never give a fuck about her to the degree like her parents do), or is just so caught up in being on her own that she's forgetting the ones who would love to hear her voice.\n\nWe are a very close family. When she lived at home, we practically did everything together. I find her age (oh, she's in her 20s, she's young) to be an excuse. Her brother is 21, still lives at home and is happy to talk with us frequently and spend every day together. If it wasn't summer and he was attending classes again, after homework or on the weekend, we'd often go see a movie or spend time together otherwise.\n\nI am at a loss.

Let's stick to the main point. You have cast the sole weight of maintaining a relationship on your daughter and are upset that she is not performing up to your standards.

If you want to talk to her, call her. Don\u2019t wait around for her to call just so you can chastise her for it. \n\nGiven that extreme overreaction, it sounds like you\u2019ve been overbearing and difficult to deal with for your adult child.

Your daughter didn\u2019t say anything \u201ccruel\u201d (you are beyond ridiculous and overdramatic for thinking her statement was cruel). She merely stated a true fact.

Your daughter is not your entertainment, your window to the world, your social media buddy, or your support animal.  To expect a regular call is entitled.  If she has something to tell you, she will call or text or email or DM or stop by.  Exact same goes for you.  You raised a child who became an adult.   Parents who smother their kids are the bane of existence.  The kids never grow up.  They never launch.  They can\u2019t handle the real world.  She can and does.

He was overbearing, demanding, and self-importantly critical in our communication in my late teens/early 20s. His reward for his behavior was me going no contact, and it's stayed that way for nearly 30 years (to this day). Behave in ways that align with want you truly want. This ain't the hill to die on. Bench the pride. Can the controlling manipulations (you don't need to \"test\" your daughter about calling; that's a manipulation intended or otherwise). Stop failing YOURSELF. Figure out what you want and what it's going to take to make that happen. Then do it. All parties hold responsibility in this, but it starts with you and your wife.\n\nYour family dynamic is no longer determined by you. Everybody gets a say. Say the things that truly matter, and if you don't know how to do that, get you and your wife to a therapist. They help. They give a shit. It's what they do.", "YTA. Your daughter is almost 30 years old. You are driving your daughter away with your hovering/smothering. I don't blame her for not calling you all the time. She is a 26 year old adult. Not a 16 year old girl.\n\nWant to know why she doesn't have a problem talking to her brother? Because he doesn't demand phone calls every day & he lets her decide how much or how little contact she wants. She wants an independent adult life. Which your apparently aren't willing to let her have.", "YTA just because your wife is working though some things does not make her incapable of calling first. if its such an issue then you can call there is no reason to put all the responsibility of contact with your kid on her. she was right phones work both ways and you blowing up at her saying that was and is ridiculous.", "\"The phone works both ways.\"\n\nYTA", "You might have taken your daughter's comment as disrespectful, but did you ever stop to consider the possibility that her comment might mean she feels like YOU don't call HER enough? I assume that she wouldn't have said that if you normally called her.\n\nWhen only one person is making the effort to call or reach out, it can become tiring really quickly. It feels like the other people don't want to hear from you unless you're initiating. That can be very hurtful.\n\nYTA", "YTA. The phone *does* work both ways. Your young, newly independent daughter *is* young. And busy stretching her wings. She\u2019s also older than your still dependent son. If you want to hear from her even less keep it up.

Or is it just that your daughter is the only one with the expectation to make the effort to reach out?  \"All she wants to do is hear from her daughter.\"  Did you ever stop and think that maybe your daughter wanted to hear from her mother?  Not to always be the one reaching out, but being the one reached out TO?\n\nDo you understand that... when you're the only one who makes an effort to reach out, it really makes you feel like the other person doesn't really care that much?  How would you feel if the positions were reversed, that you were always the ones calling her, but she never called you?  The fact that you jump to her being \"selfishly inconsiderate\" and think her comments about phones working both ways was \"cruel,\" is just.... it's wild.\n\nYTA.\n\nETA: Interesting to see you get roasted in r/Relationships for the same thing.  Do you think being told you're wrong in TWO subs will make an impression?", "YTA - don\u2019t put your wife\u2019s problems on your daughter. She\u2019s loving her life now.

She is 26.  She is trying to make her own life, and she is not obligated to take care of your wife.  Just because you have had a certain routine in the past, does not mean she's obligated to maintain it now that she is an adult. The sooner you learn to respect that the better.  I know it's hard.\n\nLets check in on the \"cruel\" thing she said:\n\n>\"The phone works both ways.\"\n\nA truer fact has never been stated.  Let's be clear: you are waiting for your daughter to call to prove something to you  (that she cares, that she is grateful for all you've done for her, whatever...). You are not strictly wanting communication you are asking for tribute.  If you or your wife just wanted to talk to her, you would call her like a couple of grown ups who want to talk to another grown up.  This emotional chicken is petty.\n\nLastly, I didn't even need to read all the details to arrive at YTA, it's all in your title. You \"blew up\" because your daughter isn't calling enough.

When life gets busy and the time between calls is longer, and one parent always complains that you don't call enough and the other one doesn't, guess which one tends to get called more often?

At first, she called back home frequently---every day then dwindling down to 1x/week. Although we text in-between calls (even then she sometimes doesn't respond or goes days without texting), she has settled into calling nearly every two weeks. There was one period when she didn't call for an entire month. That block of silence only ended when we stumbled upon each other when we happened to go to the same park one day.  \nHer last call was a week ago when she was driving. She knows we don't like to talk when she's driving for her safety. Even if it's through car speaker, we want her to focus. Last time we saw each other in person was Father's Day.  \nFunnily though, she seems to talk to her brother more often. I often walk by his bedroom and hear them on FaceTime calls and the like.  \nToday, they were talking on the phone and my wife came in. I walked in soon after. My wife, who obviously hadn't heard from my daughter in a while, said (in an obviously playful, pretend-whiny voice), \"You never call your parents anymore? You don't want to talk to your old parents anymore?\"  \nMy daughter took it much more seriously and asked, \"Oh, did you call?\", but I know she was baiting. My wife, still joking: \"No, I didn't call recently but we haven't heard from you!\" Then my daughter said, \"The phone works both ways.\"  \nMy wife's face fell; I lost it, after so many months of patience. My wife is still grieving the mother she lost last year...still coming to terms with her toxic family upbringing in the midst of grief...still having mysterious health issues. All she wants to do is hear from her daughter. To me, she is being selfishly inconsiderate and says something cruel like to her parents who love her more than anything or anyone.  \nI don't know if it's a guy, if she's so caught up in her new friends (who at the end of the day, don't give a fuck about her like her parents do), or is just so caught up in being on her own that she's forgetting her home.  \nWe are a very close family. When she lived at home, we practically did everything together. I find her age (oh, she's in her 20s, she's young) to be an excuse. Her brother is 21, still lives at home and is happy to talk with us frequently and spend every day together. If it wasn't summer and he was attending classes again, after homework or on the weekend, we'd often go see a movie or spend time together otherwise.  \nI am at a loss. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA.  And not just bc you expect her to make all the effort (if you want to talk, call her yourself), and not just because your expectations are unreasonable (father\u2019s day was just 2.5 weeks ago \u2026 that is a perfectly reasonable visit interval), and not just because you think regular texting is inadequate and demand voice calls in 2023, \u2026. but because you actually sound jealous of her more regular communication with her brother.", "YTA, I went through the same thing with my dad. \n\nWhen I was younger, I lived with my mum and my dad lived in another state, so we\u2019d only be able to have contact by calls or texts. He\u2019d always guilt trip me once I did call him (I was a kid/teen, I was busy a lot or there were periods where I was going through bad times and didn\u2019t want to talk). He\u2019d say things like \u2018I\u2019m your father, it\u2019s your job to contact me,\u2019 or, \u2018You don\u2019t care about me.\u2019 Stuff like that.\nI told him contact works both ways, so why was I the only one to call him or text? It seemed like he\u2019d never understand that he could call me as well.\n\nThis went on for years, but we\u2019re on better terms. He finally understands now that he can call me and text me whenever as I have a baby, so most of my focus is on my son and not calling. I am a bit better at calling as an adult, though.\n\nSo yea, you\u2019re an asshole to expect her to be the only one to make contact. If you want to talk to her, just call or text her. So what if she\u2019s busy with friends? She\u2019s an adult now, she\u2019s got a life to live outside of family. And you judging her friends the way you are when you haven\u2019t even met them is screwed up. You should be happy that your daughter is making friends that she can get along with and socialize.

Just like any other relationship, once your children are adults, you need to be a good friend.  Would you ever say this to a friend? What would you do if a friend guilt tripped you for not calling?

You walked in on your wife trying to guilt trip her into calling more than every two weeks. Your daughter responded appropriately.

She's also not very forthcoming with what's going on in her life but she willingly calls her brother frequently.

The phone does indeed work both ways. Sounds like you just wait for her to call. She may feel as though she\u2019s constantly having to reach out first to maintain the relationship (and from the sounds of it, she wouldn\u2019t be wrong). Perhaps you could work out a system where you call once and then she calls once; that way it\u2019s all of you making effort to maintain a relationship instead of putting the entire burden on her. As you can tell by my judgement, I think you\u2019re wrong on this one, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being wrong in the name of being malicious. Best of luck to you", "OP - your daughter told you what the problem is. You just aren't listening to her. \n\nYTA \n\nWhy is your relationship with your daughter entirely her responsibility?

It is not a child\u2019s job to maintain a relationship with their parents. She\u2019s in her mid twenties, living on her own for the first time most likely navigating independence and living her life. You can\u2019t compare her to her younger brother who still lives at home. Of course he can talk to you every day and spend time with you, he lives with you! \nWhen I moved out at 18, I was in school full time, working full time, and navigating adulthood. It was hard, it was a new experience for me and at first I also called my parents everyday (mind you, mine have been divorced since I was a baby), and then as the months went on and I was getting more and more busy the calls got less frequent and more stressful to remember. My mom was very understanding and often called me once I was home from work or texted me throughout the day. My father on the other hand, would berated me for taking so long to call him, he would tell me my step sisters call everyday so why can\u2019t I? My step sisters who are 15 years older than me and had life a little more figured out than I did. It took a toll on my mental health. And then my therapist sat us down one day and told me exactly what I told you, it\u2019s not a child\u2019s job to maintain a relationship with their parents. \nYou as a parent, have gone through your 20s, 30s, 40s, etc. Your daughter is 26 and just now learning what it\u2019s like to be independent and on her own. She\u2019s probably a little stressed out, and even if she\u2019s not she\u2019s probably just enjoying her life. \nYour daughter is completely correct, the phone works both ways.

Would it kill you to show your daughter she is also a priority to you? Not just demand that you are a priority to her? \nWhat worked for my parents and I, was simply just being more understanding of each others circumstances. My father and I agreed that we would switch off on who called first. Sometimes we didn\u2019t hear from each other for a few weeks, sometimes it was every other day. This helped both of us stay accountable and feel like we were prioritizing each other. \nAnd you shouldn\u2019t get to weaponized what your wife is going through if you\u2019re going to say that your daughter \u201cbeing young and in her 20s\u201d is an excuse. When we lost my grandmother my mom started to pick up the phone even more than she normally did. Because she realized how little time we have with people and she wanted to make the effort to make everyone in her life (friends, family, neighbors) feel like they were a priority to her. \n\nOh and, if you hear her talking to her brother more, it\u2019s probably because he doesn\u2019t call her selfish for not calling more often. Just saying.", "YTA, she\u2019s an adult and doesn\u2019t owe you shit. You look like a lunatic, and are probably the reason she barely calls. I imagine her side of the story is floating around r/insaneparenrs", "YTA, I see so much of my own \"you never call\" fight I've been having with my mother since I moved out for uni, right down to the comparison with the brother. That was actually the dumbest argument on your end, your son still lives with you, how in the fuck can you compare his level of engagement with his parents to hers? My brother moved out but still lives in the same town as my mother, I moved to a city that's 1:10h away and I had to listen to that bullshit argument a million times. It can create so much resentment to compare your kids at all, let alone when circumstances differ so much, so I'd be very VERY careful bringing up that argument again.\n\nAs for the rest of your post, calling every 1-2 weeks especially with receiving texts in between seems fine  to me. As long as she's not known to have a dangerous lifestyle or hobbies like regularly going skydiving or something like that, which would warrant a certain level of worry even for an adult child, this seems like a completely normal level of contact. The reason she may not call more often might be similar to mine, meaning she just doesn't have a lot of exciting or new things happen to her and she just doesn't feel the need to tell you about regular every-day things like how she did the laundry that day. The reason why she talks more with her brother might be because they may have common interests (are they close in age?), he might be thinking of starting uni or a job soon and is asking her for advice, etc, plus she's probably thinking brother will update parents, no need to call them as often and tell them the same thing. \n\nIMHO, you need to ease up and accept your daughter has a life outside of her family and as long as she's not doing something seriously dangerous, there's no need for either of you to check in on each other more often. I regularly went no contact with my mother for months because she was so overbearing with this exact issue.

Your daughter noticed her mum only ever spoke to her if she reached out so she\u2019s naturally pulling back.", "I (very recently) decided to go LC with my parents. One if the reasons is they only call when they need or want something (a benefit or discount that I get for being an employee as an example.) I waited two weeks for them to call me after I stopped doing so every day due to feeling like I was the only one who put in the effort to have any kind o relationship with them. Finally, after two weeks, I called them out on it via text and my mother had my father call me.\n\nHe acted like my text asking them why they never call me first was some kind of hilarious joke when I was speaking to him on the phone. It's extremely disheartening to feel that it's my (and only mine, apparently) responsibility to maintain the relationship. Not only that, but he made a joke of my feelings of being not important enough to receive a phone call, which ultimately hurt me more and makes me want to talk to either of them much less.\n\nDon't be like my parents.

She\u2019s 26 she\u2019s doing what she\u2019s supposed to do which is gaining her independence and learning how to be out in the world on her own. As we navigate our early adulthood learning to stand on our own often means stepping away from family to figure out who we are as individuals- and that\u2019s in a good healthy family. Stop taking your daughters newfound independence personally. You aren\u2019t owed her time or contact simply because of who you are to her. Too many parents do this and then wonder why their children don\u2019t call- they don\u2019t want to be guilted each time they do. Instead of seeing it as a great thing that your daughter has a good relationship with her brother and they talk often you\u2019re offended. You can\u2019t guilt, pressure, force or shame your daughter into being closer with you. Try to find a better way or the calls will continue getting fewer and far between.

My children are very different from each other. \n\nTHEY HAVE THEIR OWN LIVES. In no way is there an intrinsic obligation for any of them to pick up the phone and call me regardless of if I have just lost my dog or if I just won a GTO. If I want to share something or just hear their voices I call them. If they don't answer I assume they are busy.\n\nI have already had my chance to be a parent. It's over for me, and almost for you. We bring our children into this world to meet a need within ourselves - they don't ask us for life. Their don't come with a built in obligation to be at our beck and call when they are adults. Everything you get from this point forward is built on the relationship you had with them as children - but if you aren't careful you can still screw it up. \n\nSo yes.

I have stopped calling just to see how long it goes before anyone checks to see if I\u2019m even alive. Maybe she\u2019s doing that too.
