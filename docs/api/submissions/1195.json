He's an energy vampire and these people purposely look for new victims because eventually they drain everyone that gets close to them.  In the same way you wouldn't sit next to a radioactive generator, why would you continue to be close to this guy who makes you feel so awful?  Ghost  and block him if it's easier, or send a quick text that says \"I'm going to do some soul searching and mental health care.  I will not be available for contact any further.\" and then block him.  Do not respond to anything else he says or does, even if he threatens to commit suicide.  It's just a bluff toxic people do to get you back under their control.", "NTA. He sounds really nasty. What he\u2019s doing is bullying.", "NTA\n\nOther people's emotional needs are never more important than your own, and any sort of relationship that threatens your mental health so severely needs to be ended. That \"friend\" - after just one month of knowing him I would consider him more of an acquaintance than an actual friend - is using you for his own mental health support and guilt tripping you into spending time with him by complaining about how miserable he is, while simultaneously bringing you down, insulting you and undermining your sense of self worth and your self confidence - that is also not the bahavior of an actual friend.", "NTA you need to get rid of the toxicity to heal. From one CPTSD sufferer to another\u2026 cut the dead weight. Good luck", "NTA, not even in the slightest. \n\nHe is emotionally dumping on you and is abusing any good will you had toward him. You're not a friend in his eyes, you're an emotional therapy pet. \n\nWalk away from this person and shut the door behind you.", "NTA. This guy doesn't sound like a good friend.

You don\u2019t need this kind of negativity in your life, cut him loose", "NTA, Your FMIL is correct.  This guy is using you as his emotional landfill and not willing to reciprocate without name calling, putting you down and being dismissive.  This is emotional abuse.  Abuse you can quickly put an end to.

On the contrary, I was under the impression that the more I tried to cheer him up, the more irritated he became.\r  \nUntil another friend told me that he was an \"energy vampire\", that is, a person interested only in sucking vitality and positive energy from others, to make them miserable like him. \"He'll wind up hauling you down too,\" she told me.\r  \nSo I went to my friend and had an honest and open conversation about how his attitude made me feel. He got very angry, tried to blame me, said I was selfish... and I believe that in that moment he showed his true colors.\r  \nThe friendship ended. For a while I felt sorry, but over time I realized that I had made the right choice.\r  \n\r  \nI hope my experience can help you in some way.\r  \n\r  \nNTA, of course.", "NTA for cutting all contact with this guy. He's emotionally abusing you. You did not make a friend, you came within the grasp of an energy vampire and misery-inducing AH.\n\nWhere is your fiance in this? A partner should be supporting you, encouraging you to do mentally healthy things (like block these awful texts), and building you up. Why are you letting someone else harm you emotionally like this?", "nta, get this loser away from you.", "NTA. This guy is toxic. He feels so bad about himself he feels the need to bring you down. He is jealous of you. I had a friend like this, and I just told her I don\u2019t think we are good friends to each other, and left it at that. If he was really your friend, he would be building you up. You would be happy to hear from him. Your mental health matters.", " NTA."]}
