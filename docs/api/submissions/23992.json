I guess no one was expecting anything but praise in that moment.\n\nBtw. at this point this is not just family stuff, he started to try to sell his AI created pictures as well at least a few weeks ago.\n\n\nEdit: My mother was aware that it was an AI generated picture.

Low effort and high quality will still be high quality. Imagine taxi drivers in the future complaining about other peoples with the same job using auto pilot because they aren't working as hard.

Your brother used AI. Big whoop. Let your mum be proud of him. It doesn't diminish you as a person or an artist.", "In the past, artist who made art by hand considered those who used computers to lack artistic skill and integrity. Now your brother is producing art using an extreme version of that. The thing is - that stuff he produces is still art. You can tell because it makes your mom feel something. You can tell because people are willing to buy it. Using new tools doesn\u2019t make it a \u201csham\u201d, any more than using Adobe Illustrator would make you a fake illustrator. \n\nThese new tools are far from perfect. They produced nearly finished work in seconds, but are incredibly difficult to fine tune. Reproducing the same image again can by a tremendous challenge. Basically - like all tools you know, they\u2019re good at some things and bad at others. \n\nAsserting that artists using new tools aren\u2019t real artists is gate-keeping.

There are a lot of variables that contribute to the quality of the work - confidence of line, depth of colour, composition balance, diversity of texture.\n\nI think that your saying that AI is art - is reflective of your lack of understanding of what art is.\n\nI also hate the cliche that art is subjective. It\u2019s not. What you personally enjoy is subjective. But you can\u2019t just \u2018throw paint on a canvas\u2019 and call it art.

You might not agree that it is art, neither do I to be frank, but to call out a present is so childish.", "YTA. AI art requires extensive knowledge of art history, camera controls, and graphic arts knowledge. It's difficult to get the image you want. Now if they are just plugging in \"landscape\" and taking the first image, one could argue it is simple and lazy, but it's still an image they made collaborating with AI.\nSo long as there is no deception it's all good.

You and like many artists are overreacting. Whether you like it or not, ai art is gonna be an option, and theres nothing wrong with it. So yeh, im gonna defend ai art.

Is it different because he generated it himself?Is AI ethically different because AI is large companies profiting off of smaller artists without their consent? Picasso was one person, stealing the ideas of one person. But he also was more famous, and profited from someone less famous by taking their ideas. I think Picasso was an asshole. But that doesn\u2019t make it \u201cnot art\u201d. There\u2019s a long history of stealing ideas in art. You can feel whatever way you want about that- I find it unethical.

The AI lets you opt out of all that skill building and even the knowledge of talented artists to steal from.  \n\n\n\nIt's as much art as showing up with a kit car to the science fair and claiming it's legit to submit a finished auto with a working combustion engine as entirely your own work and invention because you followed the kit instructions.  And you paid someone else to build the car, too.", "Except he didn\u2019t generate it, the computer did. I don\u2019t know exactly how it works, but from the description it sounds like he just types in phrases. Like red barn, fallen in roof, corn field, country road, crows on utility wires. The computer searches millions of paintings for those components and \u201ccreates\u201d the art. No talent required. No knowledge of paint mixing, no knowledge of light and shadow or shading, no knowledge of composition, no knowledge of proportion, no knowledge of composition. All he does is describe what he wants.

As an artist, myself, I don't consider AI to be capable of making art, properly defined.

I see you are an illustrator so that makes sense that an ai generated piece of art is looked down upon by you.  \n\nAs I read this, you're jealous that ai is basically doing what you do as a career.   Also sounds like there is a huge dynamic of jealousy towards your brother revolving around your mom.  You sound like a person losing a race and trying to say the person winning isn't worthy.  \n\nI dont get ai art either.

The first person to buy a tube of paint was probably criticized for not spending hours with a mortar and pestle, compounding their own. \n\nWhat he does is no less of an art form, but he shouldn't be trying to pass it off as regular art, with the labour that goes into that. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nFuck that noise. I'm a proud hater of AI art. I'm also a freelance artist and since the panini and the rise of AI art I'm not even able to pay my fucking bills without living at my parents' rent free and having other jobs to supplement my income.\n\nHonestly? Fuck AI art. Fuck Chat GPT. Fuck any AI invading the arts and fuck the folks who use them. And fuck your brother in particular, especially for wanting to make money off of this (yeah, ban me for this, I don't care, this hits a nerve).\n\nI'm not saying all AIs are bad. But why invent AIs that hurt people and their income (in this case the arts, but it was also a big thing for translators once big corporations started to use Google translate and the likes way back)? Why not invest in inventing AIs that make art more accessible? If you can make AIs that spit out a certain image from words, you can do it the other way around\u2014there are already a few things like that out there. Like, AIs recognizing pictures and trying to describe them for alt text, but according to my blind friends most of those are trash.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know. Money. I literally do not fucking care.\n\nAnyway, definitely not the asshole. Sorry for the rant.", "Obviously NTA as it was a civil interaction. \n\nAs a motion graphics designer I understand where you\u2019re coming from but I do feel a bit uncomfortable with dismissing AI art as art. What is being considered as art will always be contentious. \n\nTo me, art isn\u2019t defined by the time put into it, it certainly isn\u2019t defined by the tools used and it isn\u2019t defined by the source it\u2019s derived from. To me art is a living creation which shouldn\u2019t be defined at all.
