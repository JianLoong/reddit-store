I have been drawing for years and also teach part time as an art tutor at an art school for children. So this basically hurts me at my core.\n\nStory: A few months ago my brother (40m) started to use AI to make some pictures. It\u2019s his thing now. Our mother thinks it all looks so amazing and doesn\u2019t understand how little skill goes into these pictures.\nYesterday she celebrated her birthday and got another picture from him. It was a big celebration and she showed it to all her friends, telling everyone what an amazing artist my brother is.\nI said that she should mention this is AI generated and to stop telling people he made it himself.\nShe then turned around and told my brother to explain how he \"creates art\" by using AI.\nHe sheepishly tried to explain how he puts words into an AI generator and the **hard work** is to find the correct phrasing, so it creates what you want. That is really what he said. *It\u2019s challenging to find the rights words.*\n\nI am now \"a hater\" and should appreciate my brother's efforts.\n\nAITA for calling out my brothers sham? Especially in front of the guests.\nThere was no scene and I didn\u2019t shout. The celebration was not interrupted. We all just talked while snacking at the table and this was what I said when my mother showed the picture off. I did not stand up on my chair and loudly proclaimed my hate against AI. People were taken aback tho by my \"criticism\", because my mom was so chirpy about the picture. I guess no one was expecting anything but praise in that moment.\n\nBtw. at this point this is not just family stuff, he started to try to sell his AI created pictures as well at least a few weeks ago.\n\n\nEdit: My mother was aware that it was an AI generated picture. I did not destroy her joy of the gift she received. I am \"a hater\", because I explained to the guests that my brother does not deserve 100% credit to the picture basically.\n\nEdit2: This post is so getting out of control. That is so wild.\n1. My mother is not a bad mother, because she likes a gift from her son and does not know what exactly goes into AI.\n2. I only said that he did not drew the picture himself, it\u2019s AI generated and it should be said, instead of \"He made it all by himself\". People are somehow saying I called his picture shit and embarrassed him in front of everyone about how bad his gift is. I never expressed any opinion about wether or not I like the picture to anyone during that conversation.", "created_utc": 1691315210, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jlmom/aita_for_calling_out_my_brothers_ai_art/", "score": 2684, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Low effort and high quality will still be high quality. Imagine taxi drivers in the future complaining about other peoples with the same job using auto pilot because they aren't working as hard.

Your brother used AI. Big whoop. Let your mum be proud of him. It doesn't diminish you as a person or an artist.", "In the past, artist who made art by hand considered those who used computers to lack artistic skill and integrity. Now your brother is producing art using an extreme version of that. The thing is - that stuff he produces is still art. You can tell because it makes your mom feel something. You can tell because people are willing to buy it. Using new tools doesn\u2019t make it a \u201csham\u201d, any more than using Adobe Illustrator would make you a fake illustrator. \n\nThese new tools are far from perfect. They produced nearly finished work in seconds, but are incredibly difficult to fine tune. Reproducing the same image again can by a tremendous challenge. Basically - like all tools you know, they\u2019re good at some things and bad at others. \n\nAsserting that artists using new tools aren\u2019t real artists is gate-keeping.

There are a lot of variables that contribute to the quality of the work - confidence of line, depth of colour, composition balance, diversity of texture.\n\nI think that your saying that AI is art - is reflective of your lack of understanding of what art is.\n\nI also hate the cliche that art is subjective. It\u2019s not. What you personally enjoy is subjective. But you can\u2019t just \u2018throw paint on a canvas\u2019 and call it art.

You might not agree that it is art, neither do I to be frank, but to call out a present is so childish.", "YTA. AI art requires extensive knowledge of art history, camera controls, and graphic arts knowledge. It's difficult to get the image you want. Now if they are just plugging in \"landscape\" and taking the first image, one could argue it is simple and lazy, but it's still an image they made collaborating with AI.\nSo long as there is no deception it's all good.

Is it different because he generated it himself?Is AI ethically different because AI is large companies profiting off of smaller artists without their consent? Picasso was one person, stealing the ideas of one person. But he also was more famous, and profited from someone less famous by taking their ideas. I think Picasso was an asshole.

The AI lets you opt out of all that skill building and even the knowledge of talented artists to steal from.  \n\n\n\nIt's as much art as showing up with a kit car to the science fair and claiming it's legit to submit a finished auto with a working combustion engine as entirely your own work and invention because you followed the kit instructions.  And you paid someone else to build the car, too.", "Except he didn\u2019t generate it, the computer did. I don\u2019t know exactly how it works, but from the description it sounds like he just types in phrases. Like red barn, fallen in roof, corn field, country road, crows on utility wires. The computer searches millions of paintings for those components and \u201ccreates\u201d the art. No talent required. No knowledge of paint mixing, no knowledge of light and shadow or shading, no knowledge of composition, no knowledge of proportion, no knowledge of composition. All he does is describe what he wants.

But why invent AIs that hurt people and their income (in this case the arts, but it was also a big thing for translators once big corporations started to use Google translate and the likes way back)? Why not invest in inventing AIs that make art more accessible? If you can make AIs that spit out a certain image from words, you can do it the other way around\u2014there are already a few things like that out there. Like, AIs recognizing pictures and trying to describe them for alt text, but according to my blind friends most of those are trash.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know. Money.

What is being considered as art will always be contentious. \n\nTo me, art isn\u2019t defined by the time put into it, it certainly isn\u2019t defined by the tools used and it isn\u2019t defined by the source it\u2019s derived from. To me art is a living creation which shouldn\u2019t be defined at all.

You\u2019re kind of like the old school railroad firemen who got mad that trains started running on electric rather than coal.", "NAH I don't see any A-holes here. As an artist with decades of experience, I have dabbled in both traditional art and AI \"art\". I view AI art as a fascinating form of language-based expression, and in this realm, I see myself more as a curator than the traditional role of an artist. It is essential to acknowledge that traditional artists should receive proper compensation when their work is utilized in AI programs, and they should have the option to opt out if they wish.\n\nThe current arrangement in the art world often seems unfair to traditional artists, as their creations can be used without proper acknowledgment or remuneration. It's crucial to respect and protect the rights of artists in both traditional and AI spaces. There is an abundance of copyright-free and public domain source material available for AI-generated art, it is unnecessary to take others' work without their permission.\n\nAlthough artists have always drawn inspiration from various sources and admired other creators' work, some cultures emphasize copying, while others encourage individualism. I believe it is essential for AI artists to embrace humility and recognize that while creating interesting AI-generated images requires skill, it cannot be compared to the level of effort and technique demanded by traditional or even digital art. The two are distinct and offer different creative experiences.\n\nIf you find yourself upset by someone in your family creating AI art that seems like a blatant rip-off of other artists' work for commercial gain, I suggest having a private conversation with them about your feelings. It's possible to create AI-generated images that are unique and unlike anything previously seen. Encourage them to explore originality and respect and support the work of other artists. Perhaps even making an effort to buy original handmade art with his funds made from NFT's to help traditional artists thrive.\n\nThroughout history, technological advancements have replaced certain roles and tasks, such as the sewing machine replacing seamstresses, the synthesizer replacing orchestras, and the calculator replacing mathematicians. AI and automation have expanded the creative possibilities for less skilled individuals. However, traditional art still demands a significant level of skill, craftsmanship, and effort, which we continue to appreciate and admire.\n\nAs a proficient traditional artist, I recognize the value of both traditional and AI art but acknowledge that generating images through AI requires a different set of skills that a person may not have developed. Each form of art has its distinct charm and contribution to the creative world. In light of this, I hope that we can all appreciate and support artists, regardless of the medium they choose to express themselves.", "I think strictly in regards to manners YTA.

Current gen AI are diffusion models. Essentially, what happens is that during the training phase, the model is presented with an image, and then another image to which noise has been deliberately added. The model is then tasked with restoring the original image from the noise. With each image, it is adjusted a little bit so that it's restored image resembles the known original. You do this for a few billion images.\n\nThen, at the end, you give the model a picture of random noise, and tell it that that random noise is really an image of something it needs to restore. And so it creates the image. \n\nAs you can see, by design a direct copy is impossible, because the training data and the generation never meet. The only thing that's possible is indirect copy, whereby the model is overtrained on a specific image. This can happen if a certain image features too often in the dataset, but can only happen for a few images.

Even then, it's usually not *exactly* what I wanted. \n\nWhereas I can tell a human illustrator, \"give me a realistic image of a female elf that looks kind of like these three reference pictures holding a bow and facing the camera with a taller figure in full plate with a mace and a shield with a stylized sun on it behind her in a forest background with mist and fairy lights\" and get exactly what I need, with less than ten minutes of my time spent on descriptions and revisions.\n\nIf I just need something colorful to take up space on a page, sure, MidJourney is fine. If I have a specific character or scene I need illustrated? Human all the way. Even aside from the ethical issues, a human's work is just better and less hassle. \n\nIt's possible that various algorithms will eventually get to the level of quality and specificity I need, but we're a long way off.", ">I specifically stated that in the post\n\nLOL!\n\nYou specifically stated it in the post because that's what you'd like to believe.\n\nBut unfortunately, I also read the rest of your post, and if the events occurred as you related them, you caused a scene.", "Adding to this, as a digital artist of over a decade there isn\u2019t a reason to be threatened by AI either\u2026 I find it insane to be so terrified of what is, at the end of the day, a tool for us as humans to utilize.\n\nThe goal is to adapt and streamline processes while utilizing AI, (ex. Generating images with a basic composition you would like and using it as a reference) if you can\u2019t do that as a creative individual then maybe art/expression isn\u2019t the correct place to be earning an income for that individual.", "But you're wrong, you butt hurt people are a tiny minority and the rest of us understand that AI is here to stay, isn't just theft and has something different to offer.

Turns out, plenty of people.\n\nArt is not the first and won't be the last field that technology replaces jobs in. Like many fields, there will remain a segment of high-end work done by hand. Particularly for AI art, it currently can't push truly new ground like a human can. It can only work within what it has learned. So, there's still a need for human artists, just less of them.\n\n>while being flooded with fake art compiled from computers by that mass theft\n\nWhile I agree AI art should be labeled as such, it's not \"fake\", just not made by a human. Similarly, it isn't stealing anything.\n\nEvery artist who has ever lived has been influence by the works they've experienced. The paintings they've seen, the songs they've heard, the stories they've read. Learning from others works is not stealing.\n\nIf AI produced something so similar you thought it was a copy-righted work, sure, but that isn't what they generally do. In fact, it would be quite hard to make them do that, even if you were trying. That's not how these models work. They don't remember or store any of what they are trained on. The models only contain the higher-level patterns drawn from multiple examples.", "File-sharing is certainly here to stay and it's still pretty unambiguous that unauthorized sharing of copyrighted works is just theft.

You can have all the faith and fun in the world with your toy but that's all it is, a toy. Art is generated by human beings. \"Art\" generated by a computer is not definitionally not created by humans and is, therefore, not art.

AI art is derivative, not just copies. Art doesn't need to be created by humans. Theft involves the removal of the original. These are facts of the matter.

Artists read a hit piece on AI art being theft exactly one time and there's now zero way to change their minds.\n\nAll most AI art models do is look at a picture for a long time and then create it's own interpretation based on your prompt, from scratch. It's doing what a normal human artist would do, just way way way faster. That's the fact of the matter. That's not theft. \n\n\"It's trained on copyrighted work\" yes, work that is easily available online for every human eye to view with no restrictions or complications.\n\nSo if I Google a bunch of Rembrandt paintings, and try to use elements of that style in my own unique works, im a thief?

You can shit in a can and call it art. You can telephone someone across the world and tell them to pick up a random pebble and sell it for you, and you can call that YOUR art. Whether or not anyone else agrees with you or wants to assign a monetary value and display it in a museum is a separate issue. Art theorists and artists for the past 70 years have greatly broadened the scope of what is and can be called art. There have been many VERY stupid things that have been done as a result, lol. But it also has been a great democratizer of ideas, and in a very tangible way, has freed the control of discussion from a small group of elites (gallerists, curators, scholars, critics) to a kind of \u201canything goes, if it\u2019s in any way compelling enough to grab the attention of anyone\u201d.

The art \u201celite\u201d still assign monetization to a large amount, and that aspect has not been democratized, it\u2019s gotten a lot worse and crooked, in many ways. Anyways. \n\nGo make art.
