I have been drawing for years and also teach part time as an art tutor at an art school for children.

Our mother thinks it all looks so amazing and doesn\u2019t understand how little skill goes into these pictures.\nYesterday she celebrated her birthday and got another picture from him. It was a big celebration and she showed it to all her friends, telling everyone what an amazing artist my brother is.\nI said that she should mention this is AI generated and to stop telling people he made it himself.\nShe then turned around and told my brother to explain how he \"creates art\" by using AI.\nHe sheepishly tried to explain how he puts words into an AI generator and the **hard work** is to find the correct phrasing, so it creates what you want. That is really what he said. *It\u2019s challenging to find the rights words.*\n\nI am now \"a hater\" and should appreciate my brother's efforts.\n\nAITA for calling out my brothers sham? Especially in front of the guests.\nThere was no scene and I didn\u2019t shout. The celebration was not interrupted. We all just talked while snacking at the table and this was what I said when my mother showed the picture off. I did not stand up on my chair and loudly proclaimed my hate against AI. People were taken aback tho by my \"criticism\", because my mom was so chirpy about the picture. I guess no one was expecting anything but praise in that moment.\n\nBtw. at this point this is not just family stuff, he started to try to sell his AI created pictures as well at least a few weeks ago.\n\n\nEdit: My mother was aware that it was an AI generated picture. I did not destroy her joy of the gift she received.

Putting the right words in the generator is the creative bit but it its not the same as a sculpture produced by Michelangelo or a painting by Rembrandt.  \n\nThe thing is art is subjective.  AI art does require a level of creative ability but very little skill.  The same goes for the kind of art where people splatter paint randomly on a canvas and people will happily pay huge sums of money for it.  No real skill there but people get upset when you point it out.  Even that seems sensible when compared to the 'art' that sometimes wins the Turner Prize.", "NAH.

You would've been better served to discuss this with your mom on the sly rather than in front of everyone.\n\nMild YTA.", "YTA and artists will always be biased about this. Low effort and high quality will still be high quality. Imagine taxi drivers in the future complaining about other peoples with the same job using auto pilot because they aren't working as hard. Surely you can see how that just comes off as jealousy and, when mentioned to invalidate their works at a party, as being a party pooper?\n\nYour mother liked it, didn't she?", "YTA sadly. Your brother used AI. Big whoop. Let your mum be proud of him. It doesn't diminish you as a person or an artist.", "In the past, artist who made art by hand considered those who used computers to lack artistic skill and integrity. Now your brother is producing art using an extreme version of that. The thing is - that stuff he produces is still art. You can tell because it makes your mom feel something. You can tell because people are willing to buy it. Using new tools doesn\u2019t make it a \u201csham\u201d, any more than using Adobe Illustrator would make you a fake illustrator. \n\nThese new tools are far from perfect. They produced nearly finished work in seconds, but are incredibly difficult to fine tune. Reproducing the same image again can by a tremendous challenge. Basically - like all tools you know, they\u2019re good at some things and bad at others. \n\nAsserting that artists using new tools aren\u2019t real artists is gate-keeping. That makes you an AH. \n\nYTA", "YTA art is art, some people just throw paint at a canvas and call it done. This really isn\u2019t any different", "YTA. \n\nArt takes many forms and is created many different ways. But more importantly, why would you insult a gift that made your mom happy? \n\nYour brother creates art differently than you. Stop being jealous about it.", "YTA. You sound jealous. AI art doesn't come out perfect. You have to photoshop it, even cut and paste different images together. You can run hundreds of prompts before you get something decent. Leave him alone.", "Abstract art isn\u2019t someone throwing paint at a canvas. It\u2019s a very skilled practice that\u2019s developed into very interesting periods of modern and contemporary art. There are a lot of variables that contribute to the quality of the work - confidence of line, depth of colour, composition balance, diversity of texture.\n\nI think that your saying that AI is art - is reflective of your lack of understanding of what art is.\n\nI also hate the cliche that art is subjective. It\u2019s not. What you personally enjoy is subjective. But you can\u2019t just \u2018throw paint on a canvas\u2019 and call it art. Real art can point to other movements that have influenced it, and there\u2019s the ability to show the intention along with the mastery of the materials.", "> There was no scene \n\nWell, other than the scene you caused.\n\nIs it disingenuous to pass off AI art as your own? Yes.\n\nDid you need to point it out at that exact moment and devalue the gift that made your mom happy? No\n\n> he started to try to sell his AI created pictures as well\n\nOh who cares. Get over yourself.\n\nYTA, sorry.", "Yeah, you is a asshole. What you have preferred a clay pinch pot? It\u2019s your mothers birthday, and I know you thrive off it, but let the attention go to someone else for once. Sometimes I find it hard to type right word into Amazon, but then I do and my dad gets a present delivered to his house. Is that cheating? Edited to ad: there\u2019s all kinds of art. You might not agree that it is art, neither do I to be frank, but to call out a present is so childish.", "YTA. AI art requires extensive knowledge of art history, camera controls, and graphic arts knowledge. It's difficult to get the image you want. Now if they are just plugging in \"landscape\" and taking the first image, one could argue it is simple and lazy, but it's still an image they made collaborating with AI.\nSo long as there is no deception it's all good. MFA here that works in midjourney. It is not easy at all. I find it frustrating but also fun.", "KTA (Kinda the asshole). You could have joked around and taken it lightly. This wasnt a big issue, it doesnt matter if u r an artist. It just shows you're jealous for some reason when there need no be. \n\nLet there be ai art, its an optional thing.", "I admit i sometimes mess around with Ai's but i would never say I created it", "It can be hard to find phrasing but not as hard as to make art.", "I said this in another comment already:\nMy brother is like a child who is fascinated by what the world can do now, but not thinking about where it comes from, or how it works. It makes me sad and angry, but it\u2019s so hard to talk to people if they don\u2019t understand what they are doing. He is the least malicious person I know and he feels great creating all these pretty pictures, but it does not change that imo what he does is not okay.\n\nHonestly tho, the only thing I did yesterday was just state that he did not make the picture from scratch and used AI. Which is why I don\u2019t see myself as a hater in that situation. I did not say what I just told you. I did not start a discussion about AI in general, that would not have been appropriate in that setting for sure.\n\nPlus we had these talks in my family already, there is no coming together.", "Aren't artists always talking about how its art if it makes you feel something rather than mechanical skill?", "Well thats one way of looking at it, but instead of stealing, you could say that ai is using different data to create art. Which is what humans do as well. You think your art is so original? Im sure you have heard that we all borrow from existing ideas, so that doesnt mean you're \"stealing it\". You and like many artists are overreacting. Whether you like it or not, ai art is gonna be an option, and theres nothing wrong with it. So yeh, im gonna defend ai art. Even tho i will most probably only consume art made by human anyways.", "Look, the guy probably doesn't have a lot going for him. We all know it's not art but do you need to kick someone when they're down?", "Nope it doesnt steal art", "To be fair: HE did not lie about it. My mom knew it was AI. When she showed it off she did not tell anyone it\u2019s AI generated and I said that she should tell them it\u2019s AI. She just said that her son made this for her.", "Oh yeah, my mom shows appreciation to us all, when we make stuff for her. If I had made something creative for her, she would have shown it to everyone as well.", "It is completely unethical to sell AI generated \"art\" as a creation you made as an artist. Unless he is telling potential buyers it is an AI product he is ripping them off.", "If someone like, say, Picasso, steals the style and content of someone like say, Braque, is Picasso\u2019s painting not art? Cause that happened, and they teach people about those paintings in art history classes. Is it different because he was using different tools? Is it different because he generated it himself?Is AI ethically different because AI is large companies profiting off of smaller artists without their consent? Picasso was one person, stealing the ideas of one person. But he also was more famous, and profited from someone less famous by taking their ideas. I think Picasso was an asshole. But that doesn\u2019t make it \u201cnot art\u201d. There\u2019s a long history of stealing ideas in art. You can feel whatever way you want about that- I find it unethical. But it doesn\u2019t make it \u201cnot art\u201d.", "He actually is! He is a musician and puts a lot of effort into his music. Which is why it makes me sad how he doesn\u2019t understand the effort that goes into drawing or why it\u2019s so icky to sell something you barely made yourself as your own. I thought about \"making some music\" and pull a reverse on him, but I don\u2019t think he will understand that I am trying to show him how his behaviour makes me feel. It will just look like a childish clap back, I think.", "I don\u2019t think he is an asshole either. The whole situation just unfolded because my mother said he completely made it himself (like from scratch), which simply is not true.", "He doesn't create anything except a reason to stop putting real, human art on the internet for talentless hacks to steal.", "He didn't create art in any way shape or form. There is no art involved in typing a sentence into an AI prompt.", "Adding to my comment: In my view, AI-created artwork takes more effort and creativity than much of the crap that hits galleries. A toilet? Splashes of paint thrown at a canvas? A rotting banana? \n\nMore intent and creativity goes into the AI-generation process than into any of those.", "Well, it did not cause a scene. We all just talked calmly at the table. I specifically stated that in the post, to prevent assuming comments like yours. Did not work.", "Yeh the way op is decribing him, he sounds like a little kid. We all know ai art is meant to be automatic, so whats the fuss?", "Does he say it's AI when he tries to sell his work?", "Honestly, still NTA, but in that scenario I'd just let mom brag at that point", "Picasso would have had both the talent and technical knowledge to actually plagiarize another artist's physical work.   The AI lets you opt out of all that skill building and even the knowledge of talented artists to steal from.  \n\n\n\nIt's as much art as showing up with a kit car to the science fair and claiming it's legit to submit a finished auto with a working combustion engine as entirely your own work and invention because you followed the kit instructions.  And you paid someone else to build the car, too.", "Except he didn\u2019t generate it, the computer did. I don\u2019t know exactly how it works, but from the description it sounds like he just types in phrases. Like red barn, fallen in roof, corn field, country road, crows on utility wires. The computer searches millions of paintings for those components and \u201ccreates\u201d the art. No talent required. No knowledge of paint mixing, no knowledge of light and shadow or shading, no knowledge of composition, no knowledge of proportion, no knowledge of composition. All he does is describe what he wants. Someone who uses a computer program to create art like animators do all that. They do the drawing, the coloring, the composition, just with pixels instead of brushes and paint. Using AI takes zero artistic talent.", "Wait until he finds out that AI music exists...", "You asked the question to the sub. I gave you my answer and I stand by it.\n\nGetting AI to create what you want *is* difficult. Sure as heck more creatively difficult than throwing paint at a wall or plopping a toilet in a room.", "I just want you to be aware that all you're actually doing with this comment is proving that you don't know nearly enough about art to be talking about it so confidently.", "Just because you didn't shout doesn't mean you didn't cause a scene. You probably made everyone feel awkward and your mother did a good job deflecting by asking your brother that question. I think it is important to keep an open discussion on AI art and the use of AI in other facets as well, but this wasn't the place to do it. Your mom liked the picture, that is what's important.

He showed my mother some coins he made, NFT stuff (if I overheard correctly) and when I asked what they were talking about and he showed me and I saw it was more AI stuff, I completely cut myself out of the conversation, because I did not want to start yet another argument about why selling AI is bad.\n\nI doubt it, tho. Not because he wants to be malicious, but he truly sees no problem with AI art and does not think more then 5 minutes about where it is coming from. He might be 40, but he is more like a child that is fascinated by what technology can do. I don\u2019t mean it as an insult, I mean he is .. like na\u00efve?

And OP should have kept their mouth shut too.", "You are literally claiming that typing something like \"Woman standing in field of yellow flowers\" half a dozen different ways into a textbox and then waiting 30 seconds for an AI-generated image to load takes more time, effort, intention, and creativity than the hundreds of hours and *weeks* that it took someone like Jackson Pollock to create a single human-made painting... that people like you then write off as \"splashes of paint thrown at a canvas\". \n\nYou are quite literally not showing anything other than your own ignorance.", "Happy to show my ignorance, then. :)"]}
