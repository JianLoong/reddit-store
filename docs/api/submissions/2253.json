She is a junior in college and attends school in the same city that we live. My daughter and two of her friends live in a condominium that I own. Her friends pay below-market rent while my daughter does not. The condo was inherited from my parents and it was their intent that I would pass ownership of it to my daughter when she is mature enough to own her own place. My daughter, husband, and I are in agreement that she will take over ownership of the condo when she is out of school and financially independent.\n\nEarlier this week, my daughter mentioned that she had run out of some household supplies and would have to set aside time to go shopping before the end of the week. My daughter's schedule has been especially rough lately, as she has picked up extra shifts at her part time job due to short staffing. Wanting to be helpful, I offered to pick up the supplies for her and drop them off at her place. She accepted.\n\nThe next day, I picked up the supplies and took them to the condo. I knew my daughter was in class, so I knocked and, when no one answered, let myself in. The front door opens into the living room. When I entered, I found one of my daughters roommates being intimate with a man on the living room couch. I was obviously mortified, so I left the supplies at the door and left right away. I didn't say anything to my daughter about what happened because I didn't want to put her in an uncomfortable position but I did let her know that I had dropped off the supplies.\n\nOn Friday, I got an angry email from the roommate's parents. I'm not sure exactly what they were told but their email lambasted me for invading their daughter's privacy. They said that what I did was wrong because I'm their daughter's landlord and I entered the condo without giving 24-hours notice. They're threatening to take legal action if I do it again. I am vaguely familiar with this requirement, but didn't think it was applicable here. Was I the asshole in this situation? I feel bad about what happened but I also don't feel like I was out of line.\n\nEdit: My daughter was aware that I was coming to drop off the supplies and asked that I leave them in the kitchen, which is adjacent to the living room.\n\nEdit 2: I am not asking for judgment on whether I violated the law. I checked in with a friend who is a lawyer and he thinks that, because my daughter gave explicit permission to enter the home and drop off the supplies, I'm in the clear. I am asking whether I was the asshole for doing so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI called and texted my daughter asking to discuss the situation. She can't speak to me right now because her roommates are fighting and she's mediating, but she is aware of the situation and sent me a quick explanation. My daughter had notified all the roommates that I was coming over but Roommate 1 apparently forgot. The man she was with was Roommate 2's boyfriend. She freaked out and contacted her parents because she was scared I would spill the beans. I still don't know exactly what she told her parents but I assume it wasn't the full story. I have never met Roommate 2's boyfriend, so I didn't know it was him. Roommate 1 and Roommate 2 are fighting now and, needless to say, Roommate 1 will be moving out.\n\nI will be writing a more comprehensive, formal lease for Roommate 2  for both my protection and hers but, in all honesty, Roommate 2 is wonderful and I do not anticipate that there will be any problems.", "created_utc": 1668384645, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuje53/aita_for_not_giving_24_hours_notice_to_my/", "score": 6686, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know where this falls legally but morally I say N T A. The roommate wouldn't have given 24h for her mom to drop something off. You were acting as a mom, not a LL.

If she doesn't like that and complains then a 30 day eviction notice would follow very quickly.", "NTA. If it was her parents needing to drop something off, would they make sure everyone got 24 hours notice?", "YTA.  You are a landlord and the tenants have rights.  The fact that your daughter lives there too and you charge under market is irrelevant.  Tenants have rights, including the right to not answer the door if they are busy.  It\u2019s nice that you wanted to help your daughter but you did not need to enter the condo to do so.  You could have left the supplies by the door.", "NTA. Based on your edit, you had expressed permission to enter at the specified time from your daughter. It was her responsibility to notify her roommate, so she is TA for that. The roommate is TA for having her parents contact you and threaten legal action, instead of just contacting you directly.", "NTA.\n\nYou were merely fulfilling a simple favour for your daughter. I will admit that I am unaware of the legal spectrum of this situation, but, from what I can surmise, you were helping your daughter out of convenience because she was working. You sound like a supportive type of guardian.\n\nI will admit seeing people copulating must have been rather awkward.", "NTA because your daughter gave you permission. *She* should have mentioned to her roommates that you were dropping supplies off. \n\nAlso, roomie should not be doing it in a common area. I would let her parents know that you're sorry to have walked in on her and that nice young person in such compromising positions but you had advance and express permission from another tenant to enter.", "YTA. But on a technicality. \n\nYou cannot be both landlord and mom where the tenants are concerned. They pay rent and as such are afforded certain rights. \n\nIt could be argued that yes, roommate heard the knock and could have stopped the intimate act, however that lack of answer at the door was your clue not to enter without explicit consent", "NTA\n\nFor me the fact that the roommates are happily paying below market rates as they're living in OP's condo does rather imply that they should be aware that OP may be dropping by. Hell, OP knocked on the door and she had permission to enter from her daughter.\n\nIf you're living in a friend's mother's apartment, it's not a typical landlord-tenant relationship.\n\nMy response to the threat would be to respond to the roommate's parent's email (copying her) pointing out that a) she had no expectation of privacy in a shared living room and that quite easily her roommates could have arrived home to find her and her partner engaged in sexual activity and b) OP would be quite happy to let her out of her lease should she feel that her privacy would be better respected by her living in another apartment and paying market rates.\n\nI'm sure that the friend has downplayed the sex part in *her* version of the events.", "YTA and so is your daughter for apparently not giving her friend a heads up. The roommate clearly thought she\u2019d have the place to herself (not exactly an unreasonable expectation when all your roommates are out\u2026) and you shouldn\u2019t have let yourself in. In future, you should give a time at which you are coming over if you plan to let yourself in or leave the items at the door or have your daughter pick it up. My sister lived in a similar set up and her roommate was always given a heads up the my parents or I would be stopping by or staying over.", "I'm going with NTA because I think it's more on your daughter. That said, I think you should have your daughter give the roommate notice she needs to leave.  Screwing in the shared space isn't cool and the roommate sounds like she'll be a legal problem.", "So, I think your NTA on 2 counts. Basically I\u2019m thinking about this as if it were a normal roommate situation where none of the roommates owns (or has family who own) the place. \n\n1. If this were a normal roommate situation I don\u2019t think the landlord would need express permission from all tenants for entering the place. Maybe the 24hr thing, but this is your daughters responsibility to let her roommates know \u201chey my mom is dropping off cleaning supplies tomorrow\u201d\n\n2. Unless it is explicitly agreed upon as okay by all roommates, no one should be having sex on communal furniture. And if it was agreed on that it\u2019s ok to have sex in the living room, all the more reason for your daughter to have told her roommates that you would be stopping by. \n\nHowever, in the future I would be a little more specific about plans with your daughter. Instead of just \u201cI\u2019ll drop stuff off\u201d going forward it would be good to say \u201cI\u2019ll drop stuff off between 1 and 3 tomorrow, please make sure your roommates know\u201d, or even better to just leave stuff on the doorstep or something else. I think if anyone is \u201cTA\u201d here it\u2019s your daughter, not you.", "NTA - I genuinely do not understand the other replies. \n\nAlthough yes. You do own the property. Your daughter lives there. And she told you to drop off the supplies. You were there with your \u2018mother\u2019 cap on. Not as a landlord. 24 hours notice does not apply to this situation as far as I\u2019m concerned, because your daughter explicitly told you to drop this stuff off, where to drop it off and she knew you were going in that day. Shoot\u2026 you practically did give 24 hrs notice to the master tenant by asking her if she wanted you to bring the things by the next day, which she answered with an affirmative response and told you where to put it. \n\nNow for the dirt\u2026 does your daughter know her friend was being indelicate on the living space couch? What are her feelings about that?? What are her feelings about her friends parents email? Will you raise the rent for this girl next year to market rent?", "NTA. Roommate was in the living room - a common area - and either of her other roommates could have walked in on them too. If she wanted privacy that's what a bedroom is for.

However, I do think it\u2019s important for you to keep in mind in the future that you are wearing both a Mom hat and a landlord hat here, and when it comes to her roommates, you are only a landlord.

She is a junior in college and attends school in the same city that we live. My daughter and two of her friends live in a condominium that I own. Her friends pay below-market rent while my daughter does not. The condo was inherited from my parents and it was their intent that I would pass ownership of it to my daughter when she is mature enough to own her own place. My daughter, husband, and I are in agreement that she will take over ownership of the condo when she is out of school and financially independent.\n\nEarlier this week, my daughter mentioned that she had run out of some household supplies and would have to set aside time to go shopping before the end of the week. My daughter's schedule has been especially rough lately, as she has picked up extra shifts at her part time job due to short staffing. Wanting to be helpful, I offered to pick up the supplies for her and drop them off at her place. She accepted.\n\nThe next day, I picked up the supplies and took them to the condo. I knew my daughter was in class, so I knocked and, when no one answered, let myself in. The front door opens into the living room. When I entered, I found one of my daughters roommates being intimate with a man on the living room couch. I was obviously mortified, so I left the supplies at the door and left right away. I didn't say anything to my daughter about what happened because I didn't want to put her in an uncomfortable position but I did let her know that I had dropped off the supplies.\n\nOn Friday, I got an angry email from the roommate's parents. I'm not sure exactly what they were told but their email lambasted me for invading their daughter's privacy. They said that what I did was wrong because I'm their daughter's landlord and I entered the condo without giving 24-hours notice. They're threatening to take legal action if I do it again. I am vaguely familiar with this requirement, but didn't think it was applicable here. Was I the asshole in this situation? I feel bad about what happened but I also don't feel like I was out of line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. They pay for the space and are entitled to not have their landlord pop in unannounced using a key.", "ESH.\n\nYou are their landlord, yes, but you are also the mother of one of tenants.  The issue is that, presumably, none of the other tenants have given their parents a copy of the key (and I would expect that to be in the lease) and, but for you being the landlord, wouldn't have a key into the home.\n\nThem because doing the frisky in a shared/common space is crappy.\n\nBTW, I expect you to raise the rent to the market rate.  The roommates are getting a good deal.", "YTA or Your Daughter is The Asshole. If she knew when you were coming then she should have let her roomies know.\nIf you did not say when you were going you are the asshole.\nIt seems a combo of mother daughter assholishness to be fair.", "Lol the roommate was having sex in the common area of a condo she shares with two other people, hard to imagine a real expectation of privacy there, especially with the front door opening right onto where they were, and I wonder what she told her parents. Technically yes, a landlord has to give notice, but the owners\u2019 daughter/her roommate gave permission for you to drop off the supplies. NTA in this instance and I think you handled it well. You would think she would have appreciated your discretion and learned to have private time in a private setting (her bedroom), but her actions involving her parents say otherwise smdh. No one wants to walk in and see that or sit on a communal sex couch, she needs to be more considerate of her roommates, and you definitely shouldn\u2019t let yourself in again.", "NTA If you weren't the landlord, would you take the same actions? Yes. Mum dropping off supplies for daughter, no reply to a knock, use keys to drop off supplies inside the house as requested by daughter, who is the main tenant.", "Nope NTA. You had consent from your daughter to drop by. I\u2019d be curious what BS the roommate told her parents to be sending texts like that!

Their entitlement game is nauseating, as is their tattling to Mommy and Daddy instead if calmly and politely asking for a heads up next time.", "Honestly, I'm going to go with ESH. Even though you told your daughter you were dropping things around, she should have cleared it with her roommates, so she's TA in that situation. Owning the townhouse doesn't give you the right to unlock the door and walk in if nobody answers the door so yes, you're TA in that situation. The roommate has the expectation of privacy in their own home that they're paying rent for, but she was TA for going running to her mum.\n\nOwnership of the condo and the amount of rent they're paying doesn't matter.", "NTA and I would advise the roommates parents that you are officially going to raise the rent to market rent.", "NTA since you were coming as visitor to daughter not as landlord.

They're still paying and they should still be treated with respect. \n\nIt would be an absolute nightmare to live in a place where someone just let themselves in like that.", "NTA\n\nIts a tricky situation but you said your daughter gave you permission to come and put the groceries in the house. If anything, your daughter is the A H for not warning her roommate you'd be coming with the supplies", "NTA. What if one of the roommates cane home earlier than expected?

They have a ton of gall to try and come at you legally. You are in no way the asshole. It\u2019s a complicated situation with you being the landlord and the mother, but regardless of legal obligations you are not the asshole at all. They can have fun trying to sue you and then even more fun not having their lease renewed and paying much more next year.

Now, I\u2019m in a slightly different position as my roommates parents live 5 hours away but it\u2019s still a similar situation. First of all, you did give notice to one of the tenants, your daughter. She should have told her roommates that you\u2019d be coming by.

I don\u2019t know about other doors but I know that the only way I don\u2019t hear the lock turning is if I\u2019m fast asleep, or if I have both my headphones in.

Now you obviously don\u2019t need to be in constant contact with them but you shouldn\u2019t have to rely on your daughter or their parents if you need to reach them about something. \n\nIt still is kinda baffling that this situation actually happened considering all the ways it could have been prevented (daughter giving roommates a heads up, roommate not having sex on the couch I\u2019m view of the door) but I can almost guarantee you that the only reason they\u2019re mad at you is because she\u2019s embarrassed you caught her.", "Roommate 1 was having sex with Roommate 2\u2019s boyfriend?!

You should REALLY drop a dime to her parents.", "NTA and man the drama between roommate 1 & 2 is wild.", "NTA.\n\n1. You were given explicit permission by your tenant (your daughter) to enter.\n\n2. Your daughter made her roommates aware of your impending visit.\n\n3. You knocked and got no answer. Despite the fact that the roommate was in the living room.\n\n4. She was having intimate relationships in a public shared area of the house. To some people that alone would be a violation of trust anyway because, y'know, other people use that area. \n\n5. She was screwing her roommates boyfriend in a shared area and somehow didn't think she'd get caught.\n\nBasically, she was given every opportunity to avoid this and didn't take it.", "This got juicy REAL fast!\n\nJerry....jerry..Jerry...", "Well took a left turn", "Oh my god I don\u2019t even need to put judgment, your edit is HILARIOUS. You walked into a mess! They (R1 and the BF) get what they deserve and the wake of lies and mess that comes with it", "Definitely NTA. Roommate 1 and Roommate 2's boyfriend are the AHoles here. TBH I think it's great that you walked in on them! That's what they get.", "Wow, NTA.  First, who gets intimate in a public area of a shared apartment????  Especially if they are cheating with another person who lives there's bf???  They are AHs.\n\nSecond, your daughter told them, so she's doubly AH. \n\nAnd you were kind enough to NOT creat a stink, so she lies to her parents and doesn't back down when they threaten legal action against you???\n\nYou are a saint.  NTA.", "Didn\u2019t you give notice by telling your daughter? If she told the roommates and the one forgot, that\u2019s not your problem. NTA", "Wow NTA and hopefully your daughter doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend too because wowwww", "This turned into a teenage daytime soap fast.  \nAnd is just as interesting too.", "NTA, but Damm, you unwittingly walk into a soap opera!  Who cheats w/ a roommate SO In The Shared Place??  What idiots.", "Well, THAT escalated quickly!", "NTA\n\nYou and your daughter did give them notice that you were going to be there. You did knock so you gave them a warning. If her and the other roommate\u2019s boyfriend didn\u2019t want to get caught, they should have gone somewhere else. They are lucky that it wasn\u2019t the other roommate that walked in on them. She would not have left quietly. In trying to divert the attention away from herself, the roommate really put the spotlight on herself. Karma at its best", "Can we talk about being the rm who's bf it was??  What a fucked up way to find out.", "Oooof seems like you got caught in an awkward sitch, but NTA at all! You knocked, your daughter told both roommates, and it's totally not your fault one roommate is being messy with the other roommate's boyfriend!", "You were given permission by your daughter to enter, if they sued your daughter could easily testify to that Nta edit: didn\u2019t finish reading before and wow she really told on herself, you wouldn\u2019t have even mentioned the situation but she got scared \ud83d\ude02 karma sucks", "So, roommate called her parents and said \"You won't believe what happene to me while having sex in the living room!\"  \n\nBizarre story, but NTA - OP had permission.", "The update was AWESOME!", "Fuck in a common area, risk being caught but whoever it is that enters. That\u2019s her fault for sure.", "The quick and simple of it is - you don't need notice if you're literally invited by any of the tenants. That's it.", "And from the update daughter told roommate OP was dropping off supplies. Doesn\u2019t specify time window but rommate is not very bright and forgot.", "Obviously NTA, but just in general it doesn't matter which capacity she enters..she is the landlord. That said 24hr notice was given and wtf does the parents of RM1 think would come out of sending a threatening email?\n\nOP make sure you are covered in how the move happens. RM1 might lie to the parents.", "I want to know who decides to have sex with their roommates bf in the middle of the living room in the middle of the day. They were just begging to get caught", "It\u2019s a good thing you did walk in on her then because who knows what kind of snakey stuff Roommate 1 was also doing to your daughter. I wonder how she\u2019ll spin all of this to her parents.", "This is exactly what I guessed. Roommate 1 had to make up a quick self-defending story  in case this got back to her parents. So she deflected by making it sound like you barged into her bedroom.", "Thanks for the update!  WoW! That escalated quickly!  \nNTA.", "Happy Cake Day! \ud83e\udd5e", "The email from the parents alone, would be enough for me to be kicking her out, or at least upping to be paying market value for rent. How DARE they threaten you with legal action when you are doing them such a favour with the reduced rent! Absolutely laughable, you knocked and they would have heard that, as well as the keys in the door so they should have been expecting SOMEONE to walk in.", "Lol have my angry upvote for making me read the whole thing. \n\nI kept waiting and then I felt like I was reading one of those predictive text things", "In a subleasing situation the landlord still must follow all laws for tenants as subletters are still legal tenants. If they did it that way the daughter then would also become a landlord and be subject to the same laws as the owner/landlord in this situation. Meaning she could not enter private accommodations in the same way a landlord can not enter a home without notice. This wouldn't nullify OP's legal requirements as landlord of the place they own. But also, this was not entry to inspect or maintain property. She was effectively visiting her daughter even if she wasn't there so the 24 hour notice is moot.", "Be careful, check with lawyer first, could be considered retaliation and may be illegal.", "YUP. She also had permission from her daughter. Its roomie's fault for having sex in the living room with other roomie's BF. AND she lied about it, ie that she forgot lol. Well looks like she'd moving out. I highly doubt she'll find a deal as good as the one she had, paying below market rent with some decent people. NTA", "Yeah. Gives a whole new meaning to saying someone is part of the furniture.", "Yeah man\u2026 Roomie #1 is totally, **totally** TAH for forgetting, *cheating with her roommate\u2019s boyfriend*, and instead of keeping quiet or going clean, proceeding to tell a warped story to her parents to cover her guilt.\n\nIn the future though OP, I would suggest you draft up at least some form of loose contract with whoever rents to live with your daughter. I don\u2019t think this is an example of it, but not having your tenants sign off on *something* might set you up for getting exploited or having trouble evicting if one turns out to be terrible.", "Yea that\u2019s an angle I never thought of", "the crazy thing is, her daughter did inform her roommates! roommate 1 just forgot and put all the blame on OP!", "plus \"I forgot my roommate told me the landlord was coming\" isn't a thing that will standup in court", "Apparently the daughter did notify the roommates and the one who was humping in the living room forgot, however I don\u2019t necessarily think she forgot I think she wanted to get caught", "The thing that grossed me out is if I were OP. She and her husband have more than likely sat on that couch. No thank you. I doubt the roommate is cleaning up after they\u2019re done.", "The daughter did inform the roommates. Cheater roommate claims she forgot \ud83e\udd23", "You all are missing a major point: the daughter is not the tenant. The other two girls are. They're the ones paying rent. And the landlord absolutely has a legal obligation to notify them, typically in writing, before entering their dwelling. The only exception is if there is an imminent health or safety issue.", "I had a guest in my apartment do that on my couch!  She was a friend of a friend supposedly needing emergency housing from an abusive ex.  Everyone thought I was a great idea as we had no prior contact, and I was willing to help someone in crisis who my friend would vouch for - until she invited said accused abusive ex to my home for a booty call while I was at work.", "Nasty as hell.", "Agreed. Ewww. \n\nNTA, op. \n\nYour daughter needs a better roommate.", "Does she even have a lease, if she doesn\u2019t like that the mother walked in on her maybe she should find other accommodations for her current living situation.", "Now that you know the whole story, I'd email back her parents with the whole story. Something like:\n\n>Dear \\[names\\]  \n>  \n>As a parent myself I understand your desire to protect your daughter but I am concerned she may not have given you the whole story. As you are probably aware, I am not just \\[roommate 1's\\] landlord but \\[daughter's\\] mother. \\[Daughter\\] asked me to drop off something for her and leave it in the kitchen, and I was entering with her permission. She also did notify both roommates in advance, including your daughter, your daughter simply forgot. I also knocked before entering but no one answered.   \n>  \n>When I entered the condo to leave my daughter's things where she had asked me to I accidently saw your daughter having sex in a common area. I left immediately. However, I have since been informed that the person your daughter was having sex with in the common area of her home was her roommate \\[name's\\] boyfriend. I have been told that this is why she contacted you, so that you would threaten me with (unfounded) legal action to intimidate me into being quiet so her friend wouldn't know she was cheating. Ironically, I did not realize it was \\[roommate's\\] boyfriend and had kept it to myself out of respect for your daughter's privacy.  \n>  \n>I am sorry you had to learn of this this way.   \n>  \n>Sincerely, OP", "It's super weird that she's still pulling the \"I'll have my parents call your parents\" thing when she's over 18. Roommate should be handling this directly.", "She did.  The roommate forgot the mom was coming.", "Omg you are so nice god bless you", "She wasn't concerned with your suffering when she called her parents, she was inappropriate and now that we know who she was with you also know she was way more than a little disrespectful.", "Looks like roomie #1 caused the suffering all on her own", "Well, after the one was banging the other's boyfriend, I have doubts that this roommate situation will continue.", "Your tenants should be doing that and vice versa. My parents never emailed my college apartment complex about stuff. I handled everything.", "Holy shit it gets worse! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Exactly like... imagine if it was roomate 2 who walked into the condo and not OP! If roomate 1 was trying to be sneaky why didnt she at least do shit with the bf in her own room?", "Right.  Go to the bedroom for that stuff", "Eeeeewwwwww.", "And on the couch that I assume all three roommates sit on in the communal space.... I hope someone sprays Lysol on the furniture.", "I just read the update.\n\nMaybe she thought the boyfriends are also communal?", "Your landlord forgot he is in Texas, and trying to barge into someone's home is unwise.\n\nTexas law doesn't specify a required minimum. But it also doesn't allow for entry except for a handful of reasons. Emergencies, repairs or serving a lien. Anything but those three reasons have to be specified by your leasing agreement.  If they just walk in with no advanced notice, call the cops and report a home invasion.", "Is that the law or the law as your landlord wishes it was? I think you're being conned.", "Really? the landlord can walk right in without knocking, anytime?  That's nuts!", "I wonder if OP daughter is named Stacy? And if she's got it going on. In which case they absolutely wanted to get caught/joined....", "Even if her daughter didn't, the mom *still* wouldn't be the asshole here. She was invited in to leave off supplies. The whole 24 hours notice thing is immediately nullified if you are invited, and she was not acting in a landlord capacity, but as a visitor or guest.", "Yeah. My roommate did that too.\nReally loudly. \nWhile we were all in the next room. \nThey didn't even bother to put the sofa back.", "I had a housemate who shared a room. So instead of the bedroom, she and bf used the bathroom. But not the one they shared. The one that I used and guests used. Right by the front door. I know they didn't clean it afterwards either.\n\nWe were all pretty stoked when she moved out (and in with BF).", "Legal action might go out the window once the real facts of the situation come out, and the fact that her roommates no longer want anything to do with her.", "OP doesn\u2019t need to apologise, her daughter\u2019s roommate does.\n\nShe was having sex in the living room, getting God knows what on the furniture that OP owns. That\u2019s disgusting.\n\nOP is doing her a favour by letting her pay below-market rent. This girl (the roommate) is ungrateful and entitled. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t respect OP\u2019s property, or OP, considering her immature response to getting caught. She obviously didn\u2019t tell her parents the truth. She lied to them about what happened, and then had them attack OP.\n\nShe was happy to throw OP under the bus to her parents, when what she *should* be doing is apologising to OP for being gross and disrespectful. \n\nShe can have fun paying rent at a full price elsewhere.", "When somebody spills juice on the carpet my immediate reaction is to burn down the house.", "I am more surprised that the girl went complaining to her parents about her privacy being violated, and the parents took up the complaint on her behalf. \n\nI suspect the parents were not told the full story because I find it hard to believe that the parents think it's okay for her to have sex in the living room yet also expect privacy from everyone else.", "He was channeling his inner Nick Cannon", "Communal boyfriend...OMG LOL!!! Thanks for the laugh this evening. I needed it... :D", "\u201c But, I see this one was not only abusing the communal furniture but had decided the boyfriend was also communal- I guess I shouldn't be so surprised.\u201d\n\nWell played!", "This should be mutually understood, but you should\u2019ve seen a certain thread on this sub a few weeks ago. \n\nThe OP was upset because her sister and BIL were having sex in the shower whilst they were staying at the OP\u2019s house. Everyone else had to use this shower as well.\n\nSo many people on here were defending it, as if they\u2019re somehow entitled to have sex in another person\u2019s home, and wherever they please. \n\nIt\u2019s such nasty behaviour.", "If she\u2019d just remained chill, no one would have found out.", "The communal boyfriend just charmed her into oblivion!", "Forgot mom was coming by, forgot shared spaces aren\u2019t private, and forgot not to bang her roommate\u2019s boyfriend. That\u2019s some serious dementia. \n\nNTA", "While it's true they don't have standing, when the parents threaten to sue it can be understood they would actually be helping their daughter to sue.\n\nOf course, as has been clearly established, that case would go nowhere on the merits since she was invited in.", "And now serve them with an official 24 notice so you can inspect the couch, carpet, and drapes for any semen, and/or vaginal and anal discharge so you can assess cleaning damages", "Same. That\u2019s my kind of petty.", "And she was fucking with the other roommates' boyfriend if that wasn't bad enough already.", "I uh, volunteer as tribute.", "Aaaaaaaaack!", "I have to hope she told her parents a severely bowdlerized version of the truth but yeah- with some people, you never know!", "I\u2019m just trying to imagine that conversation with her parents. So mom and dad I was doing a guy on the couch and my landlord walked in. How do you bring that up in conversation?  I think my mom would pass out.", "Yeah, gotta love those parents,huh?! They are either the true parents of the new millenium, or just next-level entitled on ALL matters, excluding absolutely nothing, not even doing your roommates' boyfriend, a recently communalized boyfriend that is, on the communal couch! lol", "It's like a millimeter less disgusting only because it's behind closed doors in a private space, ASSUMING that they cleaned up after themselves. But yeah that's still piggish behavior. Just hold your horses until you get to your own private space ugh.", "A bathroom is not a living room.", "Are you using the example of the couple who moved in with their sister due to hitting bankruptcy due to medical debt? The one we\u2019re the Op freaked out because the couple came out of the bathroom together, after OP made sure to listen and share that he wasn\u2019t able to determine if they were actually doing anything? Or was there another one along the same lines?", "I remember that. We defended it because a bathroom is by definition private. A couch is not.", "I had a polyamorous roommate in college who offered to lend me her boyfriend for the weekend in exchange for a bottle of Drambuie. I\u2019m honestly a little bummed I didn\u2019t take her up on it. He was cute.", "More likely, she gave the impression that she was innocently fooling around with her boyfriend in the privacy of her own bedroom and the landlord came in to sneak a peek. \n\nNo mention that it was someone else's boyfriend or that it was in the living room. Or if she did say it was in the living room, then she and the boyfriend were just kissing, with all their clothes on and both pairs of feet on the floor."]}
