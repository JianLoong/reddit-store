She is a junior in college and attends school in the same city that we live. My daughter and two of her friends live in a condominium that I own. Her friends pay below-market rent while my daughter does not. The condo was inherited from my parents and it was their intent that I would pass ownership of it to my daughter when she is mature enough to own her own place. My daughter, husband, and I are in agreement that she will take over ownership of the condo when she is out of school and financially independent.\n\nEarlier this week, my daughter mentioned that she had run out of some household supplies and would have to set aside time to go shopping before the end of the week. My daughter's schedule has been especially rough lately, as she has picked up extra shifts at her part time job due to short staffing. Wanting to be helpful, I offered to pick up the supplies for her and drop them off at her place. She accepted.\n\nThe next day, I picked up the supplies and took them to the condo. I knew my daughter was in class, so I knocked and, when no one answered, let myself in. The front door opens into the living room. When I entered, I found one of my daughters roommates being intimate with a man on the living room couch. I was obviously mortified, so I left the supplies at the door and left right away. I didn't say anything to my daughter about what happened because I didn't want to put her in an uncomfortable position but I did let her know that I had dropped off the supplies.\n\nOn Friday, I got an angry email from the roommate's parents. I'm not sure exactly what they were told but their email lambasted me for invading their daughter's privacy. They said that what I did was wrong because I'm their daughter's landlord and I entered the condo without giving 24-hours notice. They're threatening to take legal action if I do it again. I am vaguely familiar with this requirement, but didn't think it was applicable here. Was I the asshole in this situation? I feel bad about what happened but I also don't feel like I was out of line.\n\nEdit: My daughter was aware that I was coming to drop off the supplies and asked that I leave them in the kitchen, which is adjacent to the living room.\n\nEdit 2: I am not asking for judgment on whether I violated the law. I checked in with a friend who is a lawyer and he thinks that, because my daughter gave explicit permission to enter the home and drop off the supplies, I'm in the clear. I am asking whether I was the asshole for doing so.", "created_utc": 1668384645, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuje53/aita_for_not_giving_24_hours_notice_to_my/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I also understand the roommates parents tbh because you have to think of it like this: you're some adult stranger who busted in on their daughter while she was in a very vulnerable situation.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t visit as a landlord. You visited as a mother on a request of your daughter.\n\nAlso, who lives with other people and has sex in shared areas? This whole situation could have been avoided if the roommate was considered of people she lives with.\n\nI\u2019d consider increasing the rent, no need to do favours for people who threaten you with legal action.", "NTA, I really hope it's just your daughters parents overreacting here after she told them the story. Because other than being potentially mortifying for getting caught in the act by a roommate/friends parent, I don't see a real issue here or why the roommate would be so upset as to want to take legal action?  \n\n\nUnless this is a regular occurrence, you popping in (even at the advice/request of your daughter) I don't see the reason to complain. And if you are there frequently, that's something the roommates need to take up with your daughter rather than you as their landlady.", "NTA. I don't know where this falls legally but morally I say N T A. The roommate wouldn't have given 24h for her mom to drop something off. You were acting as a mom, not a LL. And frankly when you live with roommate, getting frisky in a shared space is disrespectful and risky. Your daughter could've walked in just as easily. And no one wants someone else's bodily fluids on their couch.", "Well somebody should have let them know .... but anyone from that house could have walked in so maybe the roommate should keep these kinds of moments to her bedroom If she doesn't want people walking in on her", "NTA. \n\nI would now turn into the arsehole, though. \n\nI feel a rent increase to normal levels for that roomy is appropriate. If she doesn't like that and complains then a 30 day eviction notice would follow very quickly.", "NTA. If it was her parents needing to drop something off, would they make sure everyone got 24 hours notice?", "YTA.  You are a landlord and the tenants have rights.  The fact that your daughter lives there too and you charge under market is irrelevant.  Tenants have rights, including the right to not answer the door if they are busy.  It\u2019s nice that you wanted to help your daughter but you did not need to enter the condo to do so.  You could have left the supplies by the door.", "NTA. Based on your edit, you had expressed permission to enter at the specified time from your daughter. It was her responsibility to notify her roommate, so she is TA for that. The roommate is TA for having her parents contact you and threaten legal action, instead of just contacting you directly.", "NTA.\n\nYou were merely fulfilling a simple favour for your daughter. I will admit that I am unaware of the legal spectrum of this situation, but, from what I can surmise, you were helping your daughter out of convenience because she was working. You sound like a supportive type of guardian.\n\nI will admit seeing people copulating must have been rather awkward.", "NTA because your daughter gave you permission. *She* should have mentioned to her roommates that you were dropping supplies off. \n\nAlso, roomie should not be doing it in a common area. I would let her parents know that you're sorry to have walked in on her and that nice young person in such compromising positions but you had advance and express permission from another tenant to enter.", "YTA. But on a technicality. \n\nYou cannot be both landlord and mom where the tenants are concerned. They pay rent and as such are afforded certain rights. \n\nIt could be argued that yes, roommate heard the knock and could have stopped the intimate act, however that lack of answer at the door was your clue not to enter without explicit consent", "NTA\n\nFor me the fact that the roommates are happily paying below market rates as they're living in OP's condo does rather imply that they should be aware that OP may be dropping by. Hell, OP knocked on the door and she had permission to enter from her daughter.\n\nIf you're living in a friend's mother's apartment, it's not a typical landlord-tenant relationship.\n\nMy response to the threat would be to respond to the roommate's parent's email (copying her) pointing out that a) she had no expectation of privacy in a shared living room and that quite easily her roommates could have arrived home to find her and her partner engaged in sexual activity and b) OP would be quite happy to let her out of her lease should she feel that her privacy would be better respected by her living in another apartment and paying market rates.\n\nI'm sure that the friend has downplayed the sex part in *her* version of the events.", "YTA and so is your daughter for apparently not giving her friend a heads up. The roommate clearly thought she\u2019d have the place to herself (not exactly an unreasonable expectation when all your roommates are out\u2026) and you shouldn\u2019t have let yourself in. In future, you should give a time at which you are coming over if you plan to let yourself in or leave the items at the door or have your daughter pick it up. My sister lived in a similar set up and her roommate was always given a heads up the my parents or I would be stopping by or staying over.", "I'm going with NTA because I think it's more on your daughter. That said, I think you should have your daughter give the roommate notice she needs to leave.  Screwing in the shared space isn't cool and the roommate sounds like she'll be a legal problem.", "So, I think your NTA on 2 counts. Basically I\u2019m thinking about this as if it were a normal roommate situation where none of the roommates owns (or has family who own) the place. \n\n1. If this were a normal roommate situation I don\u2019t think the landlord would need express permission from all tenants for entering the place. Maybe the 24hr thing, but this is your daughters responsibility to let her roommates know \u201chey my mom is dropping off cleaning supplies tomorrow\u201d\n\n2. Unless it is explicitly agreed upon as okay by all roommates, no one should be having sex on communal furniture. And if it was agreed on that it\u2019s ok to have sex in the living room, all the more reason for your daughter to have told her roommates that you would be stopping by. \n\nHowever, in the future I would be a little more specific about plans with your daughter. Instead of just \u201cI\u2019ll drop stuff off\u201d going forward it would be good to say \u201cI\u2019ll drop stuff off between 1 and 3 tomorrow, please make sure your roommates know\u201d, or even better to just leave stuff on the doorstep or something else. I think if anyone is \u201cTA\u201d here it\u2019s your daughter, not you.", "NTA - I genuinely do not understand the other replies. \n\nAlthough yes. You do own the property. Your daughter lives there. And she told you to drop off the supplies. You were there with your \u2018mother\u2019 cap on. Not as a landlord. 24 hours notice does not apply to this situation as far as I\u2019m concerned, because your daughter explicitly told you to drop this stuff off, where to drop it off and she knew you were going in that day. Shoot\u2026 you practically did give 24 hrs notice to the master tenant by asking her if she wanted you to bring the things by the next day, which she answered with an affirmative response and told you where to put it. \n\nNow for the dirt\u2026 does your daughter know her friend was being indelicate on the living space couch? What are her feelings about that?? What are her feelings about her friends parents email? Will you raise the rent for this girl next year to market rent?", "NTA. Roommate was in the living room - a common area - and either of her other roommates could have walked in on them too. If she wanted privacy that's what a bedroom is for.

Also your daughter should have mentioned to her roommates that you were coming to drop off some stuff (maybe she did mention- you should ask her)", "NTA. \n\nYou were there as a mom, not a landlord.

She is a junior in college and attends school in the same city that we live. My daughter and two of her friends live in a condominium that I own. Her friends pay below-market rent while my daughter does not. The condo was inherited from my parents and it was their intent that I would pass ownership of it to my daughter when she is mature enough to own her own place. My daughter, husband, and I are in agreement that she will take over ownership of the condo when she is out of school and financially independent.\n\nEarlier this week, my daughter mentioned that she had run out of some household supplies and would have to set aside time to go shopping before the end of the week. My daughter's schedule has been especially rough lately, as she has picked up extra shifts at her part time job due to short staffing. Wanting to be helpful, I offered to pick up the supplies for her and drop them off at her place. She accepted.\n\nThe next day, I picked up the supplies and took them to the condo. I knew my daughter was in class, so I knocked and, when no one answered, let myself in. The front door opens into the living room. When I entered, I found one of my daughters roommates being intimate with a man on the living room couch. I was obviously mortified, so I left the supplies at the door and left right away. I didn't say anything to my daughter about what happened because I didn't want to put her in an uncomfortable position but I did let her know that I had dropped off the supplies.\n\nOn Friday, I got an angry email from the roommate's parents. I'm not sure exactly what they were told but their email lambasted me for invading their daughter's privacy. They said that what I did was wrong because I'm their daughter's landlord and I entered the condo without giving 24-hours notice. They're threatening to take legal action if I do it again. I am vaguely familiar with this requirement, but didn't think it was applicable here. Was I the asshole in this situation? I feel bad about what happened but I also don't feel like I was out of line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. They pay for the space and are entitled to not have their landlord pop in unannounced using a key.", "ESH.\n\nYou are their landlord, yes, but you are also the mother of one of tenants.  The issue is that, presumably, none of the other tenants have given their parents a copy of the key (and I would expect that to be in the lease) and, but for you being the landlord, wouldn't have a key into the home.\n\nThem because doing the frisky in a shared/common space is crappy.\n\nBTW, I expect you to raise the rent to the market rate.  The roommates are getting a good deal.", "YTA or Your Daughter is The Asshole. If she knew when you were coming then she should have let her roomies know.\nIf you did not say when you were going you are the asshole.\nIt seems a combo of mother daughter assholishness to be fair.", "Lol the roommate was having sex in the common area of a condo she shares with two other people, hard to imagine a real expectation of privacy there, especially with the front door opening right onto where they were, and I wonder what she told her parents. Technically yes, a landlord has to give notice, but the owners\u2019 daughter/her roommate gave permission for you to drop off the supplies. NTA in this instance and I think you handled it well. You would think she would have appreciated your discretion and learned to have private time in a private setting (her bedroom), but her actions involving her parents say otherwise smdh. No one wants to walk in and see that or sit on a communal sex couch, she needs to be more considerate of her roommates, and you definitely shouldn\u2019t let yourself in again.", "NTA If you weren't the landlord, would you take the same actions? Yes. Mum dropping off supplies for daughter, no reply to a knock, use keys to drop off supplies inside the house as requested by daughter, who is the main tenant.", "Nope NTA. You had consent from your daughter to drop by. I\u2019d be curious what BS the roommate told her parents to be sending texts like that!

Their entitlement game is nauseating, as is their tattling to Mommy and Daddy instead if calmly and politely asking for a heads up next time.", "Honestly, I'm going to go with ESH. Even though you told your daughter you were dropping things around, she should have cleared it with her roommates, so she's TA in that situation. Owning the townhouse doesn't give you the right to unlock the door and walk in if nobody answers the door so yes, you're TA in that situation. The roommate has the expectation of privacy in their own home that they're paying rent for, but she was TA for going running to her mum.\n\nOwnership of the condo and the amount of rent they're paying doesn't matter.", "NTA and I would advise the roommates parents that you are officially going to raise the rent to market rent.", "NTA since you were coming as visitor to daughter not as landlord.

And honestly, YTA because you should have known better. I would never just let myself into an apartment where I know other tenants are. You absolutely violated that girl's privacy.

They're still paying and they should still be treated with respect. \n\nIt would be an absolute nightmare to live in a place where someone just let themselves in like that.", "NTA\n\nIts a tricky situation but you said your daughter gave you permission to come and put the groceries in the house. If anything, your daughter is the A H for not warning her roommate you'd be coming with the supplies", "NTA. What if one of the roommates cane home earlier than expected?

They have a ton of gall to try and come at you legally. You are in no way the asshole. It\u2019s a complicated situation with you being the landlord and the mother, but regardless of legal obligations you are not the asshole at all. They can have fun trying to sue you and then even more fun not having their lease renewed and paying much more next year.

Since she did breach her obligations as a landlord that could be seen as retaliatory and a court might take a dim view.", "I personally would raise the rent after this too.
