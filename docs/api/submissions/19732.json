Usually, this involves hosting a party. This summer, I'm even planning a pretty big party at a camp for a buddy who is moving back to the area.\n\nYesterday was my birthday. Nothing happened, one person remembered. It very much felt isolated to not be remembered when I tried so hard on others' birthdays. Very much considering not bothering with birthdays at all anymore, and if anyone asks I just be honest and say I'm tired of putting out energy that can't even be met with a \"happy birthday\" message in return on my own day.

Friendship needs to go in both directions", "Yup, this is it. As an adult, unless you have a partner that wants to make your birthday a big deal, if you want a birthday celebration, you gotta plan it for yourself.

I would literally just be happy with a \"happy birthday\" text to know I'm at least being affirmed to be a good presence in peoples lives.", "This. I literally can't remember the last time I went to something birthday related that wasn't taking my kid to a child's birthday party lol. NTA OP", "I'm 31 as of yesterday(also nuerodivergent, so maybe that's affecting why I'm feeling this way, don't know). This kind of thing has been kind of eating at me for a few years.

His child and I have the same birthday.", "Also, I have one friend & my sister's husband who are great at remembering dates.

I'd rather avoid having people sing happy birthday to me, anyways. it's always so awkward.", "I'd consider doing that personally. I don't know how typical my friend group is in this (and I'm older than you) but I don't think any of us know each others birthdays, but if someone told me it was important to them it would be different.", "Hence why I may just altogether stop doing things.
