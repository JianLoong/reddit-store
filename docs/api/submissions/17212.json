A wedding is supposed to be about what you and your partner want to celebrate your love and commitment, you do not need a wedding to do that. This is about the both of you and not what anyone else thinks. \n\nHonestly the fact that your vendors have shown more kindness and understanding than your family is very sad. But I'm glad you may be able to get some deposits back. \n\nSecondly, being in the military and being a military spouse is not easy and not in any way comparable to working in the auto industry. I'm not sure if your father is being willfully ignorant or just out to lunch but he is the AH for behaving the way he has. Deployment is not an \"excuse\" it is your reality and sacrifice for both you and your husband. The fact that your family seems to show no respect or support for this is again incredibly sad and my heart goes out to you. \n\nLastly, your husband is getting back from an extended deployment, you are right in knowing that he needs time and space to decompress. You both deserve time alone with each other to connect and support one another. Good for you for standing up for your husband and your relationship and ensuring that time is there. \n\nHonestly, the fact that your father has blocked you over this is gross, but probably for the best, at this point it seems like his attitudes and actions are more hurtful than anything else and you may benefit from having some space from him. \n\nWishing you and your husband the best!", "NTA but your father.. very disrespectful how he talks about you.
