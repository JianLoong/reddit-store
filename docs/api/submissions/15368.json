I've noticed that at nearly all of them, extra guests show up on the day of the wedding. A couple friends of mine have had the same thing happen to them - people who don't RSVP/haven't been invited at all show up to the ceremony and reception and then the bride and groom have to pay extra for them when it's all said and done.\n\nOur wedding is coming up soon, and after the initial RSVP deadline passed, there were still about 30 guests who never responded at all, even after some members of our wedding party followed up with them. \n\nMy fiance and I wanted to come up with a way to try to mitigate having to pay extra for people who still may show up anyway. Our venue recommended we have assigned tables/escort cards at a check-in table and give a list of guests to the person/people manning the table so they can see if non-RSVPd guests show up.\n\nWe liked the idea but decided to modify it a little -- if someone shows up who is not on the list/doesn't have an escort card, they won't be able to take a seat *unless* someone who did RSVP doesn't show up. We figure we've already paid for the seat count by that point, so we might as well fill the seats if a few people are missing.\n\nWe sent out the invitations three months before the RSVP deadline, and gave guests the option to mail their cards (we supplied the postage) in or RSVP online. I've even had some people text me and tell me they're coming, which is totally cool with me -- I've put them down as a \"yes.\" I feel like three months is more than enough time to RSVP to an event.\n\nI didn't think anything of it until I was telling one of our guests (who's already attending) about our plan, and she told me it was rude of me to not let people in who want to celebrate with us. I was a bit surprised at this response since everyone else we've told about it has been supportive. I told her it was rude of others to expect us to pay potentially thousands of extra dollars when they can't be adults and respond in a timely manner. \n\nWe're spending a lot of money per person to host this wedding, which is our choice, but I was always taught that it's really tacky to show up to someone's celebration, either uninvited or without RSVPing, and expect them to pay for you after the fact.\n\nSo WIBTA for not letting anyone who wants to show up that day into my wedding to celebrate with us?", "created_utc": 1682087891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12u45kg/wibta_for_not_letting_guests_into_our_wedding_who/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're being very generous to allow people to take the place of others who didn't show up.", "NTA, weddings take a lot of planning and a lot of money. There\u2019s a good reason you even ask for RSVPs in the first place. \n\nIf someone didn\u2019t RSVP, or didn\u2019t get invited at all, they have no right to expect a seat at the reception.", "YWNBTA\n\nSeating arrangements with seating cards usually solve this problem. If there is no seating card, then there is no seat. The venue will not add seating without approval from you. So if the staff know you are not seating anyone extra ahead of time then no one should be confused.\n\neta \u2014 as an event planner I will add you may be overthinking this a little bit. I understand that someone thought this was rude that\u2019s why you\u2019re asking however this is very standard in the industry. If they did not RSVP before the event & they do not having seating no one should be bothering you with that problem. Most people understand they can\u2019t just show up", "NTA however keep one thing in mind. Your idea might be good to let someone take a seat if someone doesn't show up. However, think it through one more time. I like the idea but you said 30 ppl didn't rsvp if you push your idea through it will be messy. Because 1. Maybe someone comes late and then you give the table away, what then? 2. What if you have 2 seats open but 4 people come? Who gets the seats? This will cause drama. What if you have one seat there, and one seat there? Drama for sure if a couple has to split up. What if it's a couple with one kid? Do you squeeze the chair somewhere? And lastly 3ish who will do all this seating stuff. Because you have so much going on during your wedding.\n4ish what about food? Is it a set menu, did they need to pick food in advance? Maybe you get complains there...\n\n Again, i like your idea but it might become very messy...", "YWNBTA, you gave plenty of time for people to RSVP. Everyone knows weddings are costly and your plan helps manage gate-crashers without you having to do it yourself and look like an AH. I would just say be prepared for a potential scene, however, as anyone who would gatecrash is likely not the most upstanding sort.\n\nOne thought though, what if someone did RSVP but their response was lost on the mail? That can happen. Have you considered padding your guest count a bit just in case of this?", "First, congratulations on your big day!\n\nYWNBTA. Nope. I don't know why that person said you would be, but nope. ***Especially*** to people who show up who weren't even invited! That's SUPER tacky, you're right. I think it's nice of you to at least let them come in if someone who did RSVP doesn't show up but you're completely within your rights to not even do that.", "You answered your own question. If they truly wanted to support you, they would've RSVP on time. 3 months is plenty of time to RSVP, and if they had an issue (family, work, etc.), they should have communicated that with you beforehand. NTA", "NTA\n\nAre you paying extra for the venue to staff a check-in table and provide escort services? If so, it might be worth comparing the cost to 15-20 unexpected guests. \n\nI don't see an issue with not seating people who aren't expected or invited, but it might be worth reaching out a final time to let them know that you're finalizing the number with the venue and that they will not be included unless they let you know they're coming.", "Your friend planning on bringing more than the extended invitation allowed or does she not know the definition of rude?", "NTA. Showing up without RSVPing is never cool--but showing up without being INVITED? Who the heck does that? For those who forgot to RSVP, your plan makes a lot of sense since it'll fill the seats you've paid for. But for those not invited? I wouldn't let them in. They don't belong there, and it's extremely uncool of them to show up. (Do people actually do that??)", "NTA. it can cost like $200 per person for some weddings. if someone can't take a minute to RSVP yes and cause you a little less stress in the planning, i wouldn't pay $200 for them. but having a waiting list at the door for people who just show up could be hard to manage.", "NTA at all. I wouldn\u2019t even do the no show thing.\n\nAnyone who arrives that was either not invited or did not confirm attendance will be escorted out.", "NTA. The point of RSVP is so everything can be prepared. It\u2019s just pure laziness to not respond and still show up and expect accommodations.", "NTA If you can't respond in three months then you don't deserve a seat. If you didn't get invited then you should not be there. Good luck enforcing this and not causing a scene which detracts from the day itself...", "NTA\n\nI think you're being more generous than you need to be with allowing them to replace the no-shows.", "NTA, it takes a lot of planning to organize an event along with the added cost. So if someone who has been thought of and specially invited cannot have the basic decency to confirm if they are coming or not, then I am of the opinion that they do not deserve to be given special treatment on the day for just showing up. Its your wedding and you make the rules.", "Nta\n\nIt's completely fair. Another option is having the overflow table, where people can sit, but no food will be served, if they are genuinely there to celebrate with you, then not getting a free meal shouldn't be an issue.", "I have been to loads of weddings and held my own. I have NEVER have I seen guests arrive unexpectedly to the wedding breakfast. In the UK most of these are pre- catered so if someone did turn up, they wouldn't have a seat or a meal anyway.\n\nThe only thing is that responses get lost, so if you do have non-responders, I would put a phone call in to check. If this is an actual thing where you live, you would be perfectly entitled to turn them away. NTA.", "INFO: is there any cultural context we should be aware of? For example, in some cultures it would be very tacky to turn people away at the door or even to expect people to rsvp, it's one of those things that is taken as a given. In other cultures those things are absolutely expected/required.", "NTA-at least where I'm from it's really rude not to respond to an invite, especially for such an important event. It's a consequence of their choices.", "NTA.  Have someone at the door checking names to the RSVP list.  Tell those not on it you are sorry but they won\u2019t be accommodated", "NTA. What is rude is uninvited/non-RSVP people showing up, expecting to be let in. If they weren't invited, then they shouldn't show up anyway. And those who didn't RSVP don't magically deserve to be let in. You gave the RSVP folks very easy options to say yes or no.\n\nWhat you should really do is have a gate keeper at the entrance. Have a list of those invited & who have sent back a yes to your RSVP. Anybody else is SOL :) Especially if you are the one's footing the bill. Why should you shell out extra money on those you didn't invite or those too lazy to tell you they were coming?", "NTA. It\u2019s rude not to respond to these invites even ruder to then show up. Everyone is well aware of the planning involved in a wedding and how expensive they are. It is not the type of event to turn up to uninvited or without RSVP\u2019ing. You need to contact all of the people that haven\u2019t replied and get definite answers out of them. And as for people turning up on the day that\u2019s an no, presumably you have a table plan so where would they go it\u2019s your wedding day it\u2019s not for you on the day having to re-adjust that.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nPeople who weren't invited definitely shouldn't get any leeway. If you wanted them there, you would have invited them. \n\nFor the others,  give one last chance- You & your fianc\u00e9 divvy up that list of people who haven't responded and get in touch with each of them \"Hey,   we never got your RSVP and we need to give the final head count to the caterer & venue. We certainly hope you can come but if we don't hear from you,  we'll have to assume that you can't make it \"\n\nPeople who can't be bothered to answer an invitation don't deserve to be fed", "NTA - If they can't be polite and do the simple RSVP, especially when followed up on, I wouldn't even let them take the place of someone who didn't show up.  I undercounted when I gave my numbers because I knew people wouldn't show up who actually rsvpd to show up.", "Lord no, you're NTA. If your wedding is anything like mine, you're paying for at least some things by the head, and the reason for asking for RSVP is planning the budget \n\n\nI'll be turning people who didn't answer away at the door,  too... and not losing a wink of sleep.\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming marriage", "NTA\u2026.I get the goal. I sympathize with you.  \n\nMost venues advise people to plan for some no shows and some extra people.  \n\nMaybe your table-tending people can explain that while there\u2019s no extra food for them, they are welcome to join for dancing and cake?\n\nAnd\u2026.if there\u2019s a VIP who didn\u2019t reply, I\u2019d call and realllly try to get their answer.  It would be so sad to turn away Aunt Mary.", "NTA, The venue needs an accurate count and you have a contract with them. Its not fair to you or them to scramble at the last minute to rearrange your seating to fit extra people and then pay extra money for people who couldn't bother to rsvp. Your wedding, not theirs!", "It\u2019s not rude it\u2019s basic common sense? NTA", "NTA, but again why on earth does everyone on Reddit share their plans with everyone under the sun, and get surprised when someone has a difference of opinions. Things like this should be between the couple and the venue. Honestly who gives a shit what other guests think about things they have zero to do with them outside of attending.", "NAH. Being rude happens, and is sometimes necessary. At the end of the day, you nor probably whoever is in charge, wants a scene other than the wedding the day of wedding. So even if you try to stop tacky people, you really won't be able to totally avoid it.", "NTA. This is literally the point of RSVP. You gave a 3 month timeline. Its rude if people just show up expecting a seat without any warning.", "INFO: Do these people happen to be first generation Americans/ immigrants? I ask because some cultures just don\u2019t have RSVPs and it can be attributed to ignorance rather than malice. Either way you\u2019re NTA but if that\u2019s the case it can be fixed with a conversation on why it\u2019s important so they\u2019re not an asshole either.", "I think it is acceptable not to allow people to attend your reception since you already paid for the seats but it would be rude not to let them into the ceremony since it doesn't cost anything and they can wish you all good love in your future marriage. Here in my country, many people will attend the church but not all will come to reception so I think this is the best solution.", "The Statue of Liberty does not say RSVP.", "So I think NTA in general. I agree with the logic you\u2019re using and frustration you must certainly feel but I guess some considerations that I would have are\n\nA. These are people that you care enough about to invite to your wedding. Is it worth potentially alienating them to send them away? \n\nB. The hope and expectation would be that they\u2019re giving a gift that\u2019s at minimum enough to cover their plate so theoretically you can hope to at least break even with them, but I realize that\u2019s not always the case. \n\nC. Anyone who shows up that wasn\u2019t invited can ef off.", "NTA. But life is busy, invitations get lost, etc. for example, I have like 20 plus first cousins all on good terms and if one showed up without rsvp I\u2019m darn well making sure we start piling in extra chairs at tables. I feel that ultimately anyone who was invited but didn\u2019t rsvp who shows up (except complete strangers not associated with a guest) wants to celebrate with you and that\u2019s what matters.", "YWBTA \n\nIf you have outstanding RSVPs just call them. The invitation may have been lost in the mail. Or their response may have been lost.\n\nFor the uninvited, you\u2019d be fine not to let them in. After all, they\u2019re gate crashers.", "If you have the budget, then just pay for the 30 guests in advance. If they show, great.

We also hired a security guard to be at the event, since the venue requires it.\n\nEDIT: Also meant to mention the food is buffet style, so there's no designated meal/plate choice in advance.

That's just a long commotion.", "Good question - we are located in the U.S. and don't have anyone coming in internationally, or have any guests with different customs than ours.", "That's exactly what we're doing! We feel the same way", "Honestly i considered this but for us i figured it was better to be safe than sorry", "Unfortunately the venue doesn't allow you to take extra food out and they don't donate it.

Also why should they pay for 30 people that probably won't show up?", "A bunch of people off to the side waiting to see if they get \"let in\"  Sounds like fun for the ushers who have to tell them this.", "I of course know that but they also should have rsvped. That's what it is for. If you are entitled enough to show up without letting them know beforehand, you are already entitled. But exactly those people would also cause drama about not siting together, getting the wrong menu etc.", "Confused by this line of questioning - because setting your guest list according to your food budget is part of planning a wedding?", "Why would invite people you can't afford was the real question", "You should never invite more people than what you can afford.", "If OP bought enough food, then there wouldn\u2019t be any situation of people waiting to see if they would be let in.  They would be admitted on sight.  Think more carefully next time.", "Because many caterers will add a surcharge for last minute or unexpected guests that weren't included in the finalized headcount.

Only 70 people RSVP, so the final cost comes out to $7,000.\n\nNow, the final count has been finalized, the caterer has prepared the food, it's day of, and now an extra 30 people show up. The caterer adds an additional $75 surcharge for every extra plate on addition to the agreed $100. So, those 30 people are each costing $175 a head. This brings on a sudden, last minute cost of $5,250 for these surprise guests. Add on the initial $7,000 for people who RSVP in a timely manner, and the final cost is now $12,250.

Why pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for a lot of extra food for people who you don't expect to show up? Especially when all that food is just going to get thrown out of it doesn't get eaten?
