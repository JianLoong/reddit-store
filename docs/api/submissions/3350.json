Sarah pouted for a minute, but then said \"Let me look in Maddy's closet first and I'll see if she's okay\".

You handled the situation with niece well, complimented her on the dress, offered her a very generous choice of dresses e.g. buying a new one and niece was not unhappy. Brother needs to get over himself as no one asked him to buy an expensive dress to wear to going to the movies and it's not like she can't wear that to other events. Your bad maybe for not mentioning it but it's not like velvet dresses are extremely popular and are everywhere and it was likely to be worn.\n\nMy eldest is also autistic and has amazing eye contact and will talk your ear off about his computer games or random facts. Your brother has a narrow view of the spectrum of autism. \n\nBtw we also do the a meltdown is a reason for the behavior not an excuse. My example was if he had a meltdown at school he's likely to verbally or physically lash out at teachers.

Sensory issues are no joke, and expecting your kid to suddenly be okay with something overstimulating is unrealistic.

The noise makes my stomach flip and I live in a rainy country which has made it a difficult thing to live with. My future career too will involve a lot of outdoor work so im having to adjust myself to it. It\u2019s so hard when people don\u2019t get it and assume that if you\u2019re autistic, you can\u2019t be a functioning individual. Your daughter handled that really well for someone who is still working on overcoming the issue and you were amazing as well! Bonus points to your niece for being so chill about it all.

You handled the situation quite well, but your brother is a giant ableistic AH deluxe, HE should apologize, not you nor Maddy!", "Yeah - like if it was the colour red, or grass; I'd be trying a lot damn harder to get her \"over\" it - but I'm thrilled that she can walk past a velvet couch without gagging now (not just for her, but it happening in public was obviously concerning and embarrassing for all involved). But yeah - velvet isn't that common and especially on young girls, so  it honestly didn't occur to me either. \n\nAnd yes - thank you! Your example of a meltdown at school is perfect. It's going to happen, it can't always be controlled, but you still, always say sorry and try and fix the situation as best as you can.", "She's at the point where if it was a fleeting moment, she'd just turn away or pay attention to something else, no reaction. If we were in a store, or whatever, and the uniform was velvet, she'd be fine as long as they didn't touch her. Which - post COVID, is a lot easier than it used to be! But I also told her that once kids get out of that \"you're so cute\" stage where every Tom, Dick and Harry feels the need to come up and say hi, and touch them, it gets a lot easier - and it has which helped. \n\nBut - I do know that this isn't entirely what you mean - but velvet is quite rare outside of \"fancier\" areas (there's one cinema we avoid for instance because they have velvet backrests); so we haven't really had that moment of Maddy having to leave. It's not like it's the colour red, or we're avoiding leather or something that we see daily.", "They cant, its literally the way the brain is wired, its like saying a windows computer can be forced to work like a mac computer if you just forced it hard enough", "I knew someone with autism who couldn't handle velvet who nearly dropped a baby that someone handed to her because the baby was wearing a velvet outfit. She had to very hurriedly push it away and explain that she couldn't touch velvet.", "That seems not related. I guess I just mean people can throw up from weird things.", "second this, the brother is not safe for Maddy to be left alone around \n\nHe's already made it clear that he does not respect Maddy and that she just needs to \"get over it\", there is zero doubt in my mind he'll try and force a trigger on her to 'cure' her", "Look, considering I didn't TELL them that this was such a big issue; or even an issue at all - again, my bad, it's just cause it's so \"rare\" to us - I am willing to give him some doubt. Like, we haven't talked about velvet in...I don't even know how long.  But - it's his actions afterwards that make me more mad.", "Okay, let me go through this one at a time. \n\nNo, the therapy is NOT making her deal with textures. We are not forcing her to touch velvet in therapy lol. Like I've said a few times, it's a rarity in our lives. The most we've had is velvet couches in a few \"older\" people's homes, and also they have velvet clothing. The therapy is really, just teaching her - and us - coping mechanisms for her fears and basically breathing through it/putting headphones on/reading at the table if someone is eating food that sets her off and then we all have the tools to help her get through it. She will never have to eat something she can't eat - but we went into this to help her get to a point where I can eat things and have her not freaking out that it's on my breath or \"residue is on my mouth\". I used to have to brush my teeth/wipe my mouth/wash my hands after eating potatoes for instance; now, I just have to make sure we don't share the same fork if I'm eating it? I don't know how else to make that make sense I'm sorry. (I am a bit unwell and my brain is very foggy). \n\nSecondly, as another poster said. Her meltdowns are a reason, not an excuse. She's had a meltdown because someone was chewing food too close to her ear and wouldn't stop. She CHOSE not to tell a teacher that was within 5 feet and instead to rip the food out of her peers hand and throw it on the ground, making it inedible. She was made to apologise to the peer, and I sent her to school the next day with money for them as an apology. Again, not punishing the meltdown. It's making right of what her actions caused because she chose NOT to tell the teacher right next to her. Nobody is responsible for having a illness/disability/what not, but they ARE accountable for how their actions affect others. It's like if someone had a heart attack while driving and crashed into you. Not their fault right? Totally uncontrollable and unpredictable. BUT - how shitty would you feel if the person DIDN'T apologise or try and give you their insurance information and just kept saying \"I had a heart attack! It's not my fault?\". That's what I'm trying to teach Maddy. the \"illness\" is a reason, BUT you still have to take accountability for what happened because of it. \"I'm so sorry, I had a heart attack, I couldn't pull over in time. Here's my insurance information - are you okay?\" sounds a whole lot better. (bad example with the heart attack, but please tell me you \"get\" what I mean!).", "Well\u2026 hackintoshes are a thing.", "I have a friend who this happened to too! Except she was working in a daycare, by herself with 3 babies (including \"velvet\" baby). The parents insisted she wear the outfit for the 'school' photos, and not remove it afterwards cause it was \"too cute\". Director compromised by saying that she could definitely wear it for the photo, but told my friend that she personally would change the baby afterwards and \"who sends a velvet dress to daycare?\". When the parents complained, director took the fall but also told the parents that -for lack of better word - my friend was \"allergic\" to velvet so to not do it again.", "if we're being honest, I think most people don't interact with velvet for years on end. It WAS fairly common at one point but now you practically have to go out of your way to find it.", "Whoa whoa whoa... Did your brother call a 10 year old girl, a family member a \"bitch\"???!!?\n\nThat's so messed up.\n\nAlso you're NTA\n\nI don't know why he got involved when apparently both girls solved the issue. \nDon't create drama where it doesn't belong.", "NTA. If Sarah, a child, can be understanding of Maddy why can\u2019t your brother? You offered Sarah (and shown Maddy there\u2019s always more solutions if you look at things from a different perspective) options 1-look in Maddy\u2019s closet or 2-you will buy her something.  You didn\u2019t damage the dress. It\u2019s Maddy\u2019s birthday and someone not wearing one certain fabric that is documented to causing her to gag isn\u2019t too big of a request. \n\nNow maybe it\u2019s because my son is on the autism spectrum, but if I were to type what I want to call your brother I would likely be banned so I will just stick with he\u2019s the giant AH in this situation. \n\nMy son doesn\u2019t \u201cappear\u201d Autistic either unless you are a specialist. Which is why it takes 3 different specialists (plus a referral from his pediatrician to see the main Autism specialist) to get a diagnosis. Your brother is just basing what he knows from what he\u2019s seen from movies and television. So he can keep his opinions to himself. The fact he most likely told Sarah to send that message to Maddy is disgusting. He\u2019s behaving like an overgrown toddler. He\u2019s the one that needs to apologize for acting this way.

I don't know what current girl's fashion is like, but when I was a kid it was a very common material for \"dressing up for Christmas\" type dresses (in red and green!) that would probably be in a store at this time of year, and kids who don't hate velvet kind of *love* it so it would make sense if it's there that a kid might gravitate towards it.\n\n If I was your brother, while I wouldn't have flipped like him, I would also be quite grumpy that I went out and bought a dress specifically for the occasion and it didn't meet secret stipulations you hadn't shared.", "NTA at all, I'm autistic with sensory issues and my worst one is polystyrene. I can't even look at the stuff, it makes me gag and my skin crawl, like my stomach wants to leap out of my mouth. I'm 33 and opening a package can be a pain in the hole because of it.

If you really really hate eating a certain food, then if you see a picture of it... obviously you're not eating the picture and you can't smell it or anything, but often looking at the picture can make you imagine the food. And you can kind of react a bit just from that imagining? I hate cheese, and sometimes when I watch pizza adverts on TV I'm like \"ewww\" as I watch people pick up a slimy, gooey piece of cheesy pizza.... It's not distressing or harmful to me, but I'll often make a face and look away from the TV. If there's a food that you really hate, I hope you can relate to this? \n\nI imagine the velvet thing is similar. She sees a velvet dress, and she imagines how it would feel to touch it, and imagines the sensation of it brushing against her skin... ew.

Not all things and not all the time, but enough things and enough of my waking and watching time, that it is draining immensely on my resources.\n\nPerhaps I can liken it further for you:\nWhen someone throws a ball in your direction, do you have a inherent calculation of where that ball will end up? And perhaps how it might bounce as it strikes whatever surface it might land on? And in that moment of striking, can you see it compress, as the power moves into the ball and then decompress as it is pushing away from that surface? That feeling of a sound that hasn't happened yet, but lingers in your mind even so?\n\nThen that would be a good approximation of feeling texture from your eyes.", "So this is a fairly little known autism fact: part of the condition involves sensory synapses connecting abnormally. This is what causes the better known sensory issues, but a less known one is that introducing a stimulus to one sense can trigger it in all five. (For example hearing a piece of music and being able to taste the food you ate last time you heard it.)\n\nSo, for an autistic child with a powerful aversion, seeing velvet may force her to physically feel it on her skin - and unfortunately it happens more with triggering substances, because the brain incorrectly interprets the disliked stimuli as a genuine threat to the body and responds accordingly. \n\nIn short, it's not so much an emotional reaction as it is the brain literally triggering the responses to an ingested poison or a wound.", "I have sensory processing disorder, and there are certain synthetic fabrics that cause my physical pain because they stick to me. Even seeing them gives me an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach.", "Did we read the same story?\n\nOP has a neurodiverse child that has trouble dealing with velvet.

Your brother has issues. His daughter sounds lovely, tho. \ud83e\udd70", "No your not an your brother does not realise how lovely a daughter he has, he needs to give his head a wobble. For her to refuse a new dress and find something else in her cousins wardrobe, well they both deserve a lovely day out an him a kick up his arse", "Not sure why you were down voted for asking a question. I can't speak to Maddy specifically, but the OP commented that she recently was able to walk past a velvet couch and not vomit as she had previously done so I imagine that she would have vomited previously. Maybe now she would just be immensely uncomfortable, probably to the point of causing herself to be Ill from the anxiousness and worry. That's what happens to my daughter when she has to wear clothes right side out (instead of inside out), even sensory friendly material.", "Thank you for taking the time to answer and explain\n\nPlease know I came from a place of love/caring for your child, there are so many abusive \u201ctherapies\u201d out there that autistic children get put through and so many harmful misinformation out there from places that claim to help us autistic people  and so many parents who get nothing but the harmful information and believing they are doing right by their child that I had to ask for clarification on both points \n\nThe only thing I (possibly) disagree with is that she chose not to tell a teacher sensory distress can be so overwhelming that you really cant do anything but react without rational thought, but yes I very much agree that she needs to apologise afterwards\n\nYour consequences are reasonable, sadly a lot of autistic children arent so lucky and as an autistic adult I know too well the damage that causes so i feel protective of those who are still so young, my earlier post now reading it back was a lot harsher than i intended, my apologies\n\nI appreciate the very thorough reply and hope you feel better soon", "I'm not autistic but I do have sensory issues, and when I was younger just seeing certain textures did make me feel like I was going to throw up. It got easier to handle as I grew older though, with time and therapy. Nowadays I can walk by those textures without making a scene or getting visibly ill, but as a child I definitely struggled with it. Just the thought of being touched by silk or suede would make me anxious.", "One autistic person chiming in - yes, at least for me.\n\nI can look at certain textures and just *know* that they are going to make me gag. Rough fabrics do it for me. I have to buy plush bath towels because normal towel texture is one that makes me physically ill. Paper towels are another texture that makes me sick. Which let me tell you, sucks when trying to clean up kitchen/bathroom as I need to as a functioning member of society. I've kind of *force sensitized* myself to paper towels and rough towels because you can't avoid those in real life, but it's awful and I sometimes end up retching over the sink after having to touch either thing.\n\nI don't know if it's super common a thing, but yeah. It's not an uncommon problem from my friends that are autistic and me.", "This is off-topic but I've literally never experienced any of that when a ball is thrown in my direction. I am also terrible at catching things. Is this how people who are good at sports perceive the world?? TIL...", "NTA. You offered perfectly logical solutions for the problem and Sarah was happy with them, until her dad got involved. And it isn't as if the dress is wasted. She'll be able to wear it for other occasions, and at 12 it's not like she is going to outgrow it in just a few months. If you live where Christmas is celebrated, green is the perfect color for her Christmas outfit.", "NTA autism is a spectrum one size doesn\u2019t fit all the lack of awareness on how different it is from one person to another is staggering.\n\nI would be very upset that he called her a bitch she\u2019s 10 years old ok he said it to you she didn\u2019t hear but still not acceptable.\n\nYour daughter may or may not desensitise from her issues with velvet but to be honest it\u2019s just one of those things. You didn\u2019t cancel your plans with her, you simply explained why to your niece and she changed. \n\nYour brother needs to go and educate himself on autism and also to check his language about a child.", "NTA. I'm glad Sarah is a good cousin, she's very sweet and understanding. She must get it from her mother because her dad is a major AH.", "YTA. I get you're protective of your daughter, but ***policing what someone else can wear*** is crossing several lines here.", "YTA: : you KNEW she had this reaction to velvet and you didn't bother to tell anyone involved. In other words, you could have prevented any of this drama from happening by just expressing her needs.  It sounds like Sarah is terrific and very accommodating, and god bless kids for that so I'm glad it had a smooth outcome, but you deserve absolutely to be yelled at. You put Sarah on the spot, and upset your own daughter by exposing her to a texture she doesn't like, all because you didn't bother to do the one easy thing you could have done to prevent it.", "ESH you should have explained the sensory issues to your brother and yes, offer some kind of apology.

My entire infant junior school had a Christmas party. Food was handed around by parent volunteers all at the same time as children sat in the dinner areas. So we all has sausage rolls, sandwiches etc handed out at the same time. Everyone got a teacake size chocolate thing that was a sort of salmon pink inside. I do not know what was wrong with it. But it was very very vile and induced vomiting. I do not know if something had been added to it deliberately, or what. Kids who hadn't yet taken a bite, were induced to vomit by all the kids around them who were violently vomiting. I couldn't bare that colour ever after. Even if it was on a flower, or in clothing, I wanted to vomit really bad. We are talking an entire school throwing up, adults and kids. I have tried to train myself out of it and have actually bought some flowers in the garden that colour, but I still find myself taking deep breaths.

You're brother to be frank, is TA. The girls worked it out. No one's feelings were hurt, you even offered a solution for the future. Your brother has no excuse. He was just being hateful. Plain and simple.", "What happens if your daughter is at school and another student in her class is wearing a velvet dress?", "NTA, funny how children are more understanding and empathetic than some adults.", "I think YWBTA. Your daughter has got to get used to the rest of the world. P.S. I am an Aspie!", "Hey that's fair. It's something that absolutely slipped my mind and something that I do take full accountability for. It is summer in Australia so, personally I feel like anyone planning on wearing velvet for more than say, a ten minute photo shoot for Christmas, would be not enjoying it at all - but now I know better. \n\nAnd that's fair. 100% I was already planning on apologising to my brother as well, and take responsibility for NOT calling him before I uploaded the photo. But, he just exploded before I could get that much out.", "No - and that is something I take full responsibility for and did apologise to Sarah for. And I 100% was planning on apologising to my brother for not telling him until he interrupted with all of his statements. Knowing me, I will still apologise for that when all this has blown over, but right now I'm not in a calm enough mind (based on everything he said) to talk about it without getting overwhelmed myself.", "Woah, okay. I don't think I harrassed my niece at all. It was a three minute conversation. I also apologised to her twice later that day; and explained it was something we were working on. Sarah said \"I get it, it's like how I hate pumpkin and daddy still puts it on my plate\". There is no hate towards my daughter at all. Sarah loves her and has told Maddy that SHE is sorry that the dress caused all this drama and that we don't need to apologise at all. \n\nYes, I forgot to tell my brother about the velvet. But, I'm Australian and it's summer right now. You'd be a fool to wear a hot, velvety dress in this weather. So it didn't even cross my mind. It wasn't like we were having this conversation about denim or the colour blue. But - \"allowing me to harass their daughter\"? None of that occurred but for the record, Sarah's dad dropped her off, was busy so left quickly, and then sent his wife (Sarah's stepmum) to pick her up cause he was \"so mad\" at me after the sleepover they had.", "Thankfully in Australia it's summer at the holiday time, so you'd be crazy to wear velvet for more than a ten minute photo shoot!", "Look that's fair. And I do admit I dropped the ball there. It literally didn't occur to me because of how \"rare\" velvet is in our lives. I've now realised I do need to add it to the list of \"Maddy-ism's\" that people need to be aware of.", "Fair. I appreciate the comment. I felt not great doing it - which is why I offered several solutions and was extremely grateful for Sarah being able to pick another outfit.", "She's 10.

Read the post again ffs", "I'm autistic and agree with almost everything you're saying.  But\n\n>She CHOSE not to tell a teacher that was within 5 feet and instead to rip the food out of her peers hand and throw it on the ground, making it inedible.\n\nThis is a tad harsh.  Whilst obviously she should apologise and work on strategies to avoid anything like that happening it's not likely she \"chose\" it.  More likely she was initially overwhelmed, froze and lost the ability to communicate, became more overwhelmed and her brain autopilot solved the problem for her as she melted down.\n\nSo basically I think \"chose\" is not a good word to use here and if someone used that language with me I'd be a bit hurt by that description.  I hope that makes some sense.  My parents accidentally hurt me like this a lot so I just wanted to share in case it can help you have a better understanding of what she experiences.", "Not really the same. The velvet dust wasn't going to travel through the air.", "Mostly an afab legs experience I assume but amab may get it on their faces?\n\nWhen *freshly shaved* your skin is all *super* sensitive and you don't know whether you want to avoid touching anything ever again or at the same time want to rub silk or fleece on it forever because *omg everything feels 1000x softer and smoother!!!!*\n\nWell, for me as an Autistic, that is what my skin feels like all the time\n\nAnd like others have said, it becomes a sense memory - so like smelling warm baked bread transports me back to baking with my grandma and feeling cosy and happy and safe? Seeing wool makes my teeth itch and hives break out because I *know* touching it is like being wrapped in steel wool and rolled down a hill full of icy nettles", "No - absolutely! I figured that's where you were \"going\" with your comment. And I agree, I've known plenty of autistic children who went through ABA in particular forced to become verbal, punished for stimming, etc. It's why I very much went with a approach of \"how do we cope and set her up for success?\" vs \"stop this behaviour\" kinda thing? I have a friend whose mother was told to withhold food until the child said \"please may I have the food\" and \"thank you for the food\" - and take it away if she didn't! She did it because she thought \"these are the professionals, what do they know compared to me?\".", "My brother didn't overreact? He told me my child \"clearly\" wasn't autistic because she could \"make eye contact\". \n\nI did not guilt Sarah at all. I simply told her what Maddy's \"problem\" was, and said that if we were going out with Maddy, it couldn't be with that dress on; BUT here were several other options. Sarah was very considerate when she decided that was okay; and I'm extremely grateful for that. Now, do I know what I would have done if she had've said \"no, I'm wearing the dress\"? No, but nothing would have been taken out on Sarah. We would have kept talking until we figured out a comprise.", ">This is what causes the better known sensory issues, but a less known one is that introducing a stimulus to one sense can trigger it in all five. (For example hearing a piece of music and being able to taste the food you ate last time you heard it.)\n\nI'm autistic and have never heard of this but it's 100% correct, I'm stealing this explanation.", "Haha I was so relieved the first time I heard it, I was like \"THAT IS EXACTLY HOW IT IS!\"", "Wow.
