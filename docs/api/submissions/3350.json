You handled the situation with niece well, complimented her on the dress, offered her a very generous choice of dresses e.g. buying a new one and niece was not unhappy. Brother needs to get over himself as no one asked him to buy an expensive dress to wear to going to the movies and it's not like she can't wear that to other events. Your bad maybe for not mentioning it but it's not like velvet dresses are extremely popular and are everywhere and it was likely to be worn.\n\nMy eldest is also autistic and has amazing eye contact and will talk your ear off about his computer games or random facts. Your brother has a narrow view of the spectrum of autism. \n\nBtw we also do the a meltdown is a reason for the behavior not an excuse. My example was if he had a meltdown at school he's likely to verbally or physically lash out at teachers. He's always been made to write an apology letter/picture and to apologize because he needs to use his strategies and not to lash out. He's not punished any further for it because it is to some extent uncontrollable but our rule is if you do wrong you make it right.", "Just curious, what would happen if Maddy were in public and saw someone wearing velvet, someone she could not ask to wear something else?

Your brother needs to be more empathetic and learn from his child.", "NTA \n\nI know nothing about autism and especially if someone can \"get over her weirdness\" but I expect that's not something one \"gets over\" when they are autistic.

Unfortunately autism is very complex and unfortunately means there is a lot of misconception and every person with autism is vastly differentin their symptoms which makes it harder to understand.\n\nThe brother sounds like TA. I think you handled the situation with absolute class where you didn't make Sarah feel bad and she seemed ok and understanding about it all.\n\nSince you are proactive with Maddy working through this in therapy you are doing everything you can. Maddy will get better with things like this as time goes.\n\nSarah sounds more grown up then the father to be honest.", "NTA for this specific situation and Sarah was absolutely wonderful willing to accommodate and support her cousin, big kudos to her, but i do have concerns, the way it reads is that you have her in therapy to make her learn to deal with certain textures and thats not ok at all, desensitisation therapy is incredibly harmful to autistic people, it doesnt work and it causes long term harm\n\nIf she faces consequences for having meltdown then thats 10000% wrong!!!! A meltdown isnt a choice, its on the adults to understand what causes the meltdowns and avoid those situations, but she should absolutely not be punished in any way for them\n\nA meltdown is NOT a tantrum and cant be treated like one\n\nYour brother is a gigantic jerk", "NTA\n\nYou found a great last minute solution, paired with getting Maddi professional support as a long term solution.

Sensory issues are no joke, and expecting your kid to suddenly be okay with something overstimulating is unrealistic.

The noise makes my stomach flip and I live in a rainy country which has made it a difficult thing to live with. My future career too will involve a lot of outdoor work so im having to adjust myself to it. It\u2019s so hard when people don\u2019t get it and assume that if you\u2019re autistic, you can\u2019t be a functioning individual. Your daughter handled that really well for someone who is still working on overcoming the issue and you were amazing as well! Bonus points to your niece for being so chill about it all.

You handled the situation quite well, but your brother is a giant ableistic AH deluxe, HE should apologize, not you nor Maddy!", "Yeah - like if it was the colour red, or grass; I'd be trying a lot damn harder to get her \"over\" it - but I'm thrilled that she can walk past a velvet couch without gagging now (not just for her, but it happening in public was obviously concerning and embarrassing for all involved). But yeah - velvet isn't that common and especially on young girls, so  it honestly didn't occur to me either. \n\nAnd yes - thank you! Your example of a meltdown at school is perfect. It's going to happen, it can't always be controlled, but you still, always say sorry and try and fix the situation as best as you can.", "She's at the point where if it was a fleeting moment, she'd just turn away or pay attention to something else, no reaction. If we were in a store, or whatever, and the uniform was velvet, she'd be fine as long as they didn't touch her. Which - post COVID, is a lot easier than it used to be! But I also told her that once kids get out of that \"you're so cute\" stage where every Tom, Dick and Harry feels the need to come up and say hi, and touch them, it gets a lot easier - and it has which helped. \n\nBut - I do know that this isn't entirely what you mean - but velvet is quite rare outside of \"fancier\" areas (there's one cinema we avoid for instance because they have velvet backrests); so we haven't really had that moment of Maddy having to leave. It's not like it's the colour red, or we're avoiding leather or something that we see daily.", "They cant, its literally the way the brain is wired, its like saying a windows computer can be forced to work like a mac computer if you just forced it hard enough", "I knew someone with autism who couldn't handle velvet who nearly dropped a baby that someone handed to her because the baby was wearing a velvet outfit. She had to very hurriedly push it away and explain that she couldn't touch velvet.", "That seems not related. I guess I just mean people can throw up from weird things.", "second this, the brother is not safe for Maddy to be left alone around \n\nHe's already made it clear that he does not respect Maddy and that she just needs to \"get over it\", there is zero doubt in my mind he'll try and force a trigger on her to 'cure' her", "Look, considering I didn't TELL them that this was such a big issue; or even an issue at all - again, my bad, it's just cause it's so \"rare\" to us - I am willing to give him some doubt. Like, we haven't talked about velvet in...I don't even know how long.  But - it's his actions afterwards that make me more mad.", "Okay, let me go through this one at a time. \n\nNo, the therapy is NOT making her deal with textures. We are not forcing her to touch velvet in therapy lol. Like I've said a few times, it's a rarity in our lives. The most we've had is velvet couches in a few \"older\" people's homes, and also they have velvet clothing. The therapy is really, just teaching her - and us - coping mechanisms for her fears and basically breathing through it/putting headphones on/reading at the table if someone is eating food that sets her off and then we all have the tools to help her get through it. She will never have to eat something she can't eat - but we went into this to help her get to a point where I can eat things and have her not freaking out that it's on my breath or \"residue is on my mouth\". I used to have to brush my teeth/wipe my mouth/wash my hands after eating potatoes for instance; now, I just have to make sure we don't share the same fork if I'm eating it? I don't know how else to make that make sense I'm sorry. (I am a bit unwell and my brain is very foggy). \n\nSecondly, as another poster said. Her meltdowns are a reason, not an excuse. She's had a meltdown because someone was chewing food too close to her ear and wouldn't stop. She CHOSE not to tell a teacher that was within 5 feet and instead to rip the food out of her peers hand and throw it on the ground, making it inedible. She was made to apologise to the peer, and I sent her to school the next day with money for them as an apology. Again, not punishing the meltdown. It's making right of what her actions caused because she chose NOT to tell the teacher right next to her. Nobody is responsible for having a illness/disability/what not, but they ARE accountable for how their actions affect others. It's like if someone had a heart attack while driving and crashed into you. Not their fault right? Totally uncontrollable and unpredictable. BUT - how shitty would you feel if the person DIDN'T apologise or try and give you their insurance information and just kept saying \"I had a heart attack! It's not my fault?\". That's what I'm trying to teach Maddy. the \"illness\" is a reason, BUT you still have to take accountability for what happened because of it. \"I'm so sorry, I had a heart attack, I couldn't pull over in time. Here's my insurance information - are you okay?\" sounds a whole lot better. (bad example with the heart attack, but please tell me you \"get\" what I mean!).", "Well\u2026 hackintoshes are a thing.", "I have a friend who this happened to too! Except she was working in a daycare, by herself with 3 babies (including \"velvet\" baby). The parents insisted she wear the outfit for the 'school' photos, and not remove it afterwards cause it was \"too cute\". Director compromised by saying that she could definitely wear it for the photo, but told my friend that she personally would change the baby afterwards and \"who sends a velvet dress to daycare?\". When the parents complained, director took the fall but also told the parents that -for lack of better word - my friend was \"allergic\" to velvet so to not do it again.", "if we're being honest, I think most people don't interact with velvet for years on end. It WAS fairly common at one point but now you practically have to go out of your way to find it.", "Whoa whoa whoa... Did your brother call a 10 year old girl, a family member a \"bitch\"???!!?\n\nThat's so messed up.\n\nAlso you're NTA\n\nI don't know why he got involved when apparently both girls solved the issue. \nDon't create drama where it doesn't belong.", "NTA. If Sarah, a child, can be understanding of Maddy why can\u2019t your brother? You offered Sarah (and shown Maddy there\u2019s always more solutions if you look at things from a different perspective) options 1-look in Maddy\u2019s closet or 2-you will buy her something.  You didn\u2019t damage the dress. It\u2019s Maddy\u2019s birthday and someone not wearing one certain fabric that is documented to causing her to gag isn\u2019t too big of a request. \n\nNow maybe it\u2019s because my son is on the autism spectrum, but if I were to type what I want to call your brother I would likely be banned so I will just stick with he\u2019s the giant AH in this situation. \n\nMy son doesn\u2019t \u201cappear\u201d Autistic either unless you are a specialist. Which is why it takes 3 different specialists (plus a referral from his pediatrician to see the main Autism specialist) to get a diagnosis. Your brother is just basing what he knows from what he\u2019s seen from movies and television. So he can keep his opinions to himself. The fact he most likely told Sarah to send that message to Maddy is disgusting. He\u2019s behaving like an overgrown toddler. He\u2019s the one that needs to apologize for acting this way.

I don't know what current girl's fashion is like, but when I was a kid it was a very common material for \"dressing up for Christmas\" type dresses (in red and green!) that would probably be in a store at this time of year, and kids who don't hate velvet kind of *love* it so it would make sense if it's there that a kid might gravitate towards it.\n\n If I was your brother, while I wouldn't have flipped like him, I would also be quite grumpy that I went out and bought a dress specifically for the occasion and it didn't meet secret stipulations you hadn't shared.", "NTA at all, I'm autistic with sensory issues and my worst one is polystyrene. I can't even look at the stuff, it makes me gag and my skin crawl, like my stomach wants to leap out of my mouth. I'm 33 and opening a package can be a pain in the hole because of it.

This was being guests omewhere else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd OP KNEW she was being an AH - or she would not have avoided the girl's parents noticing her assholery.", "I'm gonna use an analogy to try to help here. If you really really hate eating a certain food, then if you see a picture of it... obviously you're not eating the picture and you can't smell it or anything, but often looking at the picture can make you imagine the food. And you can kind of react a bit just from that imagining? I hate cheese, and sometimes when I watch pizza adverts on TV I'm like \"ewww\" as I watch people pick up a slimy, gooey piece of cheesy pizza.... It's not distressing or harmful to me, but I'll often make a face and look away from the TV. If there's a food that you really hate, I hope you can relate to this? \n\nI imagine the velvet thing is similar. She sees a velvet dress, and she imagines how it would feel to touch it, and imagines the sensation of it brushing against her skin... ew. And you can't really switch your brain off or stop that imagining.", "As an autistic person who can get uncomfortable imagining certain textures, absolutely", "As a second autistic person: I can feel the texture of things in my eyes when I look at them. Not all things and not all the time, but enough things and enough of my waking and watching time, that it is draining immensely on my resources.\n\nPerhaps I can liken it further for you:\nWhen someone throws a ball in your direction, do you have a inherent calculation of where that ball will end up? And perhaps how it might bounce as it strikes whatever surface it might land on? And in that moment of striking, can you see it compress, as the power moves into the ball and then decompress as it is pushing away from that surface? That feeling of a sound that hasn't happened yet, but lingers in your mind even so?\n\nThen that would be a good approximation of feeling texture from your eyes.", "So this is a fairly little known autism fact: part of the condition involves sensory synapses connecting abnormally. This is what causes the better known sensory issues, but a less known one is that introducing a stimulus to one sense can trigger it in all five. (For example hearing a piece of music and being able to taste the food you ate last time you heard it.)\n\nSo, for an autistic child with a powerful aversion, seeing velvet may force her to physically feel it on her skin - and unfortunately it happens more with triggering substances, because the brain incorrectly interprets the disliked stimuli as a genuine threat to the body and responds accordingly. \n\nIn short, it's not so much an emotional reaction as it is the brain literally triggering the responses to an ingested poison or a wound.", "I have sensory processing disorder, and there are certain synthetic fabrics that cause my physical pain because they stick to me. Even seeing them gives me an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach.", "Did we read the same story?\n\nOP has a neurodiverse child that has trouble dealing with velvet. Her child\u2019s cousin and friend turned up for the neurodiverse kid\u2019s birthday in a velvet dress, not being aware of this being an issue (which OP didn\u2019t think to inform the parents of because \u2026 she wasn\u2019t expecting the child to be wearing velvet. It\u2019s not a common fabric. I\u2019m sure if she had a reaction to a common fabric like denim she would have informed the parents). \n\nNow at this point she has several choices - asking the cousin if it\u2019s ok for her to wear something else, trying to force her neurodiverse child to be around a trigger all day or sending the cousin home. \n\nShe chose the most reasonable of these options and everyone had fun until cousin\u2019s dad threw a hissy fit because *he* wanted his daughter to wear said expensive velvet dress for this occasion. \n\nHow would you suggest she should have handled the situation?", "I can imagine she would spend the entire time anxious and actively trying to avoid touching cousin."]}
