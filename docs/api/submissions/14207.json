The burden is on him to build a relationship with you, not on you to accept him no matter how rude.", "NTA. And bravo to your husband! United Front for the win! So your dad thinks it\u2019s your husband\u2019s duty to make sure his *guests* aren\u2019t disrespected in his house, but your dad thinks it\u2019s A-OK for guests to disrespect their *hosts?* And he had the audacity to tell your husband that it\u2019s his responsibility to fix your attitude?!?!\n\nStepmom is a nightmare, and your dad is a nut. After all you\u2019ve tolerated over the years, it\u2019s time to take a long look at what your life will be like going forward if you allow him (them) to be a part of it. Is this really what you want to deal with until he dies?\n\nI like your husband\u2019s approach: if dad wants a relationship with his daughter, the wife can\u2019t come anymore. I somehow doubt that dad will go along with this. But you never know. Good luck.", "NTA and just from reading this I believe the reason he\u2019s not involved with your brothers is because in his tiny little mind he already believes he\u2019s \u201cmore of a man\u201d than them buts he\u2019s trying to prove himself to your husband.", "NTA - This man clearly cares more about his ego and \u201cbeing a man\u201d than actually being there for you and your family.", "NTA. Your dad and his wife are toxic, limit contact with them.", "NTA. Your husband knows how to have your back. And if someone, let it be my dad's wife or whoever, made mean comments about my own mother, I won't even sucking it up like you did.", "NTA. I don\u2019t like your fathers attitude", "NTA, your father and his current wife certainly are.", "NTA.  Your boundaries are so reasonable and valid.  His response by telling your husband to \"fix your attitude\" is the icing on the (attempted) manipulation cake.  Your dad and his wife are TA.  No doubt in my mind.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all what a nerve of your stepmother to verbally attack your mother\u2026.Says the woman who pursued a married man\n\nSecond of all your dad should be dealing with you when it comes to issues, not belittling you by asking your husband to put you in your place \n\nWhat an old fashioned attitude and if you get nothing positive out of the relationship does he really deserve a spot in your life?\n\nStay strong OP, They\u2019re the ones in the wrong", "NTA, and I love that your husband has your back and stood by you like that! It\u2019s your house, so you get final say about who\u2019s allowed in.", "NTA, he shouldn't have let his wife be a rude guest if he didn't want to deal with consequences from the hosts. Also, go husband for immediately backing you!!", "NTA.\n\nYour dad has a funny idea of what constitutes \"respect\" - \n\nIf a guest comes into your house and decides to be nasty, like your dad's wife did, then you should treat that guest with the respect they deserve (none). She's an asshole, of course, you're not going to allow her as a guest in your home.\n\nThen you dad went to your husband to complain about you? To tell him to \"fix\" you? That's the height of disrespect, right there.\n\nGood to see you and your husband are a strong couple who have each other's backs. If your dad wants to have a relationship with you at all, he owes you and your husband a very sincere apology and he needs to learn to not be a disrespectful asshole when he's a guest. I'd write off his wife as irredeemable and never waste time on her again.", "NTA- boundaries are very important. Your dad seems like a piece of work telling your husband to deal with your attitude like who does that?!! we're not in the 1940s anymore.", "NTA continue to demand respect from both your father and his rude and manipulative wife. Stand your ground with him and keep the both of them away.", "NTA. The fact that he expects your husband to \"control and reing you in\" should tell you everything you need to know, you should wish him a good life a go at least LC with him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's time for low to no contact. The unhealthy obsession your dad's partner has on your mom is weird. It's like she has to degrade your mom to keep your dad's attention on her. Like she lacks a personality, substance or a soul. I wouldn't allow her in the home again nor would I allow dad in either. They clearly don't value as a person but rather as an object for their perfect family collection. Dad's misogynistic comments alone would ensure no contact in my eyes. I'm sorry but you deserve love and affection from real family and they ain't it. Your husband is a champ though, sounds like a keeper.", "NTA. And I like your husband! A+ for putting your dad in his place. Dad had the whole \u201clook here little lady bs\u201d coming out like he controls your life. Eww.

It sounds like the person lacking in respect was your fathers wife, to take jabs at your mother.\n\nWhat is it about this husband that has him interested in a way he was never interested before?", "Nta he already painted his picture of himself lol", "It's perplexing that the father is asking his SIL to manage OP while he can't manage to keep his own wife in line.", "NTA. It's pretty clear that what he meant by it's different because your his daughter was, \"she's the girl, so I can force her to not hate me.\" And good on your husband for stopping your father's misogynistic BS", "NTA... Is your husband rich? Your dad seems too concerned about what he thinks", "He feels you painted a wrong picture of him in front of your husband? I think your husband has a very clear picture of who he is. Also love how he didn't skip a beat by backing up you, his wife, immediately. Definitely NTA.
