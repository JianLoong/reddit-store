People. in the world, find a partner who WANTS to be with you AND your children. So NTA and I'm soo sorry OPs dad is weak and prioritized his wife over his children", "op=NTA\n\nFather(and his wife) painted wrong picture of him not you in front of your husband\n\nwon't even deal with his misogyny that husband should get you in line(UGH).\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself and good for husband for having your back.\n\nWave bye bye to daddy.  If he can't leave wife behind, you don't need that toxin in your life.", "Your husband sounds awesome. NTA.", "*\"He got really mad and said to my husband that it's his duty to make sure his guests aren't disrespected in his house and he should fix my attitude. \"*\n\nWhy do you want this guy around at all?\n\nNTA!", "Nope, NTA. The audacity to try to tell you and then your husband about behavior in YOUR house.", "nta. respect is earned.", "NTA. And sounds to me like you painted the perfect picture of who he actually is as a person.", "nta", "NTA. You have every right to decide what happens in the walls of your home. \n\nHowever, you'll likely be told in the comments that any guests that come into your house are the ones that own it and get to make the decisions in it. Don't listen to them.", "Your dad ITA and so is his wife.", "Why in the world are you letting him around you?", "It\u2019s not about his career- it\u2019s about the networking and being viewed as better. It\u2019s about possibly getting his son in law to \u201cloan me a little\u201d or \u201cput in a good word\u201d or more. Hell, it\u2019s easy enough to figure out a connection and just name drop. \u201cOh, you know the Faulderalls? Joe Faulderall Jr is my son in law!\u201d That alone causes an instant connection that puts him closer than he would have been before.\n\nI say this as someone who hasn\u2019t spoken to their father in 9 years. What does your father bring to your life? Why has he waited a decade to be in your life? Would he spend time with you one on one or would he insist on your husband being there too? It isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s about your husband being an asset to exploit.", "NTA I love your husband. Keep him, I wouldn't worry about your dad.", "NTA\n\nHe painted that picture himself when he implied your husband needs to control your actions.", "NTA.  Your dad wants to visit you, it has to be on your terms, not his.  Tell him you weren't considered good enough to visit his wife's house as a child, and now, since she keeps making derogatory remarks about your mother, she isn't considered good enough to visit yours and if he can't handle that, he can stay away too.  \n\nSince this behavior started after you got married, you might do some deep thinking about the reason.  Stepmother did not attend your wedding, but dad is suddenly very interested in having a relationship?  And says it's because you are his only daughter?   Spidey senses going off here.  Did you marry into money?  Any chance he got a bad diagnosis and is looking for a long-term caregiver?  Maybe he has finally realized how controlling his wife is and wants to ingratiate himself so he can move in with you if he leaves her?  I'd do some discrete digging.", "Another commentor really hit it over the head, I think. He was so excited once ***you*** got married in particular because he was ready for your husband to be the one \"in control\" of you and then for him to befriend your husband and gain some control over you. Only thing that makes sense, that's why he's upset you \"not only disrespected him but also painted a very wrong picture of him in front of my husband\". He's upset he can't control you and now he can't be buddies with your husband to control you (him thinking your husband actually does that). NTA", "I thank the dad and new wife are trying to start up a relationship with the only female child because they\u2019re assuming she will be their unpaid caretaker when they age.", "NTA! But his wife is.", "Nta, he chose his wife over his family. That makes him look far worse than anything you've done.", "NTA. You want to maintain a relationship with this sexist entitled AH why?", "NTA. Father is a complete AH along with his wife. Both of them were disrespectful to their hosts and why should your husband have to \"control\" you (hehe) when Father can't control his own wife. /s", "Was she invited to the wedding?", "OP I\u2019m in a very similar situation with my dad, but I just take it to try and conserve my relationship with my dad and guess what, my relationship with my father has dwindled down to nothing. Why? Because I\u2019m sick of being insulted by his horrible girlfriend and I resent that he doesn\u2019t tell her to stop insulting me, my family (including my dead mother), and my home. \n\nYou should have no regrets about speaking up for yourself and your family, I am so ashamed I allowed myself to be treated that way for a relationship that was toxic anyway.", "I left my husband when he was horrible to my kids. No way would I put up with that from anyone, even from their own father.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and his wife definitely are. Cut them off. Especially when you know that you don't owe then anything.", "NTA.  Your father shouldn't make hurtful comments about your mother.  He also shouldn't let his current wife make any comments about your mother.  Frankly, since she's his affair partner, I wouldn't have let her through the door to begin with.  His comments to your husband were way off base.  If that was his attitude when he was married to your mother, your mother should be glad he left.", "NTA. Stand your ground and know your husband has your back no matter what.", "But now you can feel proud for standing up and advocating for yourself, authentic and empowered."]}
