It\u2019s pretty a big deal in my family because Jake(28M) is the first in my family to get married. However I rejected the invite because his fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t like me.\n\nWhen we first met she kinda just glared at me. At first I thought it was just because she might be awkward meeting new people or it\u2019s cause Amy(F30) is from aboard. But I think she just genuinely doesn\u2019t like me. She always has made under minded comments about me. Whether it was about me being a single mom, dropping college and going back or even just what I eat, she makes these weird comments that I just brush off. \n\nSome examples of this during this past week: \n\n- at a family party I was talking about my son having a parent event for his soccer club. I said I was a bit nervous participating and Amy told me well it\u2019s your fault the dad isn\u2019t in the picture to do so. \n\n- I gain a lot of weight recently (30lbs) and Amy said I shouldn\u2019t be ordering anything but soups and salads for the good of myself while at a resturant \n\nEarly this week Jake and Amy came over to invite my family and I to the wedding. After they left my sister tells me that she was asked to be a bridesmaid by Amy. I didn\u2019t think anything of it and said congrats. But when my sister asked me if I was one, I said no. She look surprised. Apparently, Amy and Jake had all their siblings and cousins to be bridesmaids and groomsmen. I didn\u2019t know, and I was honestly a little sad but I just said it\u2019s whatever\u2019s. My sister was mad on my behalf and went to complain to my parents and aunts. \n\nLong story short, this has started a fight between Jake and Amy vs my family. Jake\u2019s mom was really angry that I wasn\u2019t part of the bridal party. But Jake and Amy don\u2019t want to me to be a bridesmaid cause I\u2019m not a traditional woman. I thought it was getting too much so I just decided that I shouldn\u2019t go. Am I sad? Yea, I\u2019ll feel left out but it\u2019s not my wedding and I don\u2019t wanna fight with Jake or Amy about it. My family doesn\u2019t want to go anymore but I said I\u2019ll be fine they can go enjoy the wedding. \n\nAmy did reach out to me yesterday about it.\nShe just said \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t pick you as a bridesmaid because you don\u2019t match my image I want a traditional wedding and you aren\u2019t that\u201d Then going on to how I would make the wedding pictures uneven.\n\n I just responded \u201cI\u2019m not going anymore. I don\u2019t need your reasonings on whatever you think.\u201d I thought this would make Amy happy but she wasn\u2019t. She angry texted in all caps \u201cFUCK YOU. I don\u2019t even know why I consider inviting you. You should be regretting not coming.\u201d Im not sure how to feel. But I\u2019m not alone I was thinking of just going to the beach with my son that day just so I can distract myself. But my whole family all told me I should go to the wedding. I don\u2019t really feel welcome and Jake hasn\u2019t told me anything But AITA for letting this argument with the bride affect my present at her wedding?", "created_utc": 1704457290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18z5n7t/aita_for_rejecting_my_cousins_wedding_invite/", "score": 416, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wonder, though. Have you spoken to Jake directly about this? You said that \u2018Jake and Amy\u2019 don\u2019t approve of you, but where did that statement come from? JAKE is the one you would be there to support, not Amy. Either way, this definitely isn\u2019t your fault.", "NTA you are very refreshing OP. This woman is BENDING over BACKWARDS to upset you and the most you've given her is 'meh whatever'. You don't even seem to do it intentionally to upset her, you just seem to have a healthy amount of self respect and love for yourself. Fyi nothing you say or do will make her happy so why bother trying? Don't go to the wedding, there nothing but drama and misery lies. Have a lovely time with your son", "NTA. \n> you don\u2019t match my image I want a traditional wedding and you aren\u2019t that\n\nWhat does that even mean?\nFuck Jake and Amy", "NTA. Amy is being incredibly cruel to you and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about extracting yourself from opportunities for her to abuse you from now on. Go to the beach. Anyone who doesn\u2019t like it can piss off.", "NTA. Amy is mad because she isn't getting the reaction out of you that she wants and it backfired on her that your famiy called her out for her BS. Amy is toxic AF for her comments to you. Go enjoy your day, she doesn't deserve you at her wedding. If the family doesn't go I hope it's because of her being a nasty person in her actions overall and not just the exclusion of the wedding party.", "NTA. You were deliberately excluded from the bridal party because the bride is judgemental. She even went off at you because you didn\u2019t give her the satisfaction of reacting to more passive aggressive comments. \nYour circumstances/life don\u2019t get to be judged by anyone, including family. \nIf your parents and siblings decide not to attend that is their choice, but I think having a day at the beach with your son would be more meaningful (especially for him), than attending a wedding of people that don\u2019t respect you and treat you with disgust.", "NTA. Amy doesn't want you there but is upsed you don't wanna go? LOL\n\nJust don't go as it's completely reasonable to not go anywhere you not feel welcomed.

A very clear \u201cyou can\u2019t fire me, I QUIT.\u201d There is no question of your attendance - you RSVPd \u201cno\u201d and the bride made sure that the door was glued shut.

Jake has probably talked to her another about you a lot.  \nI wouldn't bother even addressing the wedding anymore and if you get an invite, just RSVP  with a \"No, I'm unable to attend\".

I hope you and Jack have a wonderful day.  \" and then block her and if anyone says anything or asks you about it simply say you that is your big dinner gala for the  NTWC (Non Traditional Women's Club),  you are up for non traditional woman of the year after all.", "Hey OP - go to the beach. The marriage won\u2019t last.", "first things first \nNTA\nAt first I thought I'm gonna say, you can go for your cousin Jake **if you want to** without thinking of whatever the other person is. This was until, \n\n>Jake and Amy don\u2019t want to me to be a bridesmaid cause I\u2019m not a traditional woman\n\nWell thier loss,  You don't have to go if you don't want to, people who disrespect you and put you down. \n\nIt's not wrong to be sad and mad about this. She basically doesnt want you to come and texts you that, the audacity istg. Your cousin is also T-A along with her because i would never let anyone acts this way to my cousin.\n\nApart from the bridesmaid itself she is a a-hole because the way she comments on your body and about you being a single mom gives me a ick and your cousin who is not telling her off. If I was in this situation I would never be this patience, I would basically put them in thier place to not comment about my personal life.", "NTA. My cousin is getting married in August this year, and I'm not going. I didn't receive an invite to any part of it and my mum insists that I'm invited and I said \"No invite, I'm not going. It doesn't have to be a paper one. It can just be a message on Facebook or something.\" Then my mum told me that I'm only invited to the reception, not the ceremony and reception, so I told her that I'm definitely not going now. I'm holding my ground, and I have both my partner and my dad backing me up on my decision (the cousin getting married is my mums nephew) if my mum had her way she would drag me to the wedding whether I wanted to go or not. I also think it's rude that whilst even if I were invited to the wedding, there was no extension for my partner to join. I know when the wedding is so I'm planning to do something else on that day.", "NTA but you\u2019ve sullied my love of Jake and Amy in the 99 :D But seriously, Jake may not be aware of any of this stuff she says about you. So I\u2019d have a quick text or chat to say I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not coming, this is why, and I understand you need to support you fianc\u00e9 but I feel I can\u2019t go and I want you to understand why from my perspective. Possibly she\u2019s been lying about things or working on him to think differently about you. If he does know about her treatment of you and agrees or doesn\u2019t stand up to it, he\u2019s TA. She is without question.", "NTA. Honestly, do what you feel is right by you.\n\nAfter reading the comments, it seems like she's trying to shame you at every opportunity. She shames you for being a single mom, she shames you for your size, she's trying to shame you for not fitting in to her wedding aesthetic. It sounds like she's trying to get you to beg her for acceptance, which you're not doing. She projected onto you how you should feel about not being picked as a bridesmaid. When your reality didn't match her perception, she looses it on you. The key quote is \"You should be regretting not coming.\" Meaning, you should be feeling horrible, but you're not. It sounds like your family isn't terribly keen on her behavior either.\n\nRegardless if you go or not, she isn't going to be happy unless you're miserable and visibly showing it. That's why she blew up when you told her that you weren't going. That's not what she wanted to hear. She wanted to hear you cry. She wanted to hear you beg her to include you. \n\nIf you do end up changing your mind and going, play off anything she says like it's some inside joke. If she says, \"OP you're out of shape\" respond with \"Round is a shape\". Or if she says something asinine, respond with \"Oh Amy, you say just the darndest things\" or \"What a jokester that Amy.\" The better of a time you're having, the more upset she'll get. If you don't go, have a great day out with your kid. If your fam makes the decision not to go, that's also their choice. You didn't convince them not to go. Amy did by being shitty to you.", "NTA. You made your decision and told your family you didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

Sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA but anyone who actually tries to pressure you to go is. You should tell your family including Jake what Amy said to you, maybe they don\u2019t know how she has been treating you.", "NTA - I wonder if the plot twist is that she had an abortion in the past and deeply regrets it so is lashing out at you for doing what she could not (being a happy, successful single mother).\n\nEither way she disapproves of you for having a child out of wedlock and your cousin is allowing the disrespect. Low key AH in me is hoping she\u2019s infertile", "NTA.  \n\nJake is marrying the woman of his choice.  His silence says it all, so don't worry about him.  Life goes on.\n\nTell your family that no feud is necessary.  Being Amy's attendant is not an issue.  While you were sad initially, Amy's \"FUCK YOU\" says it all and more.  Right back atcha, Amy.  \n\nThankfully Amy passed over you for bridesmaid, so you won't be at her beck and call in the months before the wedding or have to sink your savings into that rodeo.  Secondly, not attending is your right; she's not a crowned head issuing a royal decree for you to show.  Consider all her snide comments you'll miss at the reception after you're seated next to the bathrooms.\n\nShe's only ticked off because you won't witness her bridal party on display while you're in the peanut gallery.  Amy, you just got bested.  Also, don't send a gift, it might make the wedding pictures uneven.", "NTA  \nShe is a bully and you are tackling it calmly, while she is showcasing her bullying for all to see.

So keep rejecting!!", "NTA \n\nFirst off, you handled things well! Amy can be a flea-ridden, feces throwing monkey bride all she wants, but not engaging in her crapfest or being pulled down to her level is probably the best idea. This is entirely a her issue, and it seems like you just happen to reflect some attributes that seem to sharpen the stick up her backend. Like, it seems like you haven\u2019t really internalized any of her comments (kudos!), but in case that is somewhere in the back of your mind, I just want to say that all of Amy\u2019s issues actually have nothing to do with you, they are all about her.\n\nIf your cousin is letting her treat you like this, then it\u2019s probably time to let that relationship go. You deserve to be respected and included.\nSince the high road also seems to piss her off, I\u2019d keep going down it. The biggest win here is if Amy has a much harder time trying to antagonize you and to paint you as the villain, so then you could have some peace. Unfortunately, that might give the couple some of what they want (you not being at the wedding and the family not trying to wack some sense into them), but I think a result where you don\u2019t have to deal with the drama would be better than everything that would come from letting the situation escalate until Amy was put in her place. It will probably happen eventually if she keeps acting like this, but the more you keep your hands clean, the easier it will be for you.\n\nYou could send a group text, \u201cWhile I appreciate that some of you have wanted me to be included with all of the other family and cousins in Jake and Amy\u2019s wedding, it has been expressed that I do not fit their idea of a \u201ctraditional wedding\u201d and should not take part in the festivities.

It\u2019s pretty a big deal in my family because Jake(28M) is the first in my family to get married. However I rejected the invite because his fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t like me.\n\nWhen we first met she kinda just glared at me. At first I thought it was just because she might be awkward meeting new people or it\u2019s cause Amy(F30) is from aboard. But I think she just genuinely doesn\u2019t like me. She always has made under minded comments about me. Whether it was about me being a single mom, dropping college and going back or even just what I eat, she makes these weird comments that I just brush off. \n\nSome examples of this during this past week: \n\n- at a family party I was talking about my son having a parent event for his soccer club. I said I was a bit nervous participating and Amy told me well it\u2019s your fault the dad isn\u2019t in the picture to do so. \n\n- I gain a lot of weight recently (30lbs) and Amy said I shouldn\u2019t be ordering anything but soups and salads for the good of myself while at a resturant \n\nEarly this week Jake and Amy came over to invite my family and I to the wedding. After they left my sister tells me that she was asked to be a bridesmaid by Amy. I didn\u2019t think anything of it and said congrats. But when my sister asked me if I was one, I said no. She look surprised. Apparently, Amy and Jake had all their siblings and cousins to be bridesmaids and groomsmen. I didn\u2019t know, and I was honestly a little sad but I just said it\u2019s whatever\u2019s. My sister was mad on my behalf and went to complain to my parents and aunts. \n\nLong story short, this has started a fight between Jake and Amy vs my family. Jake\u2019s mom was really angry that I wasn\u2019t part of the bridal party. But Jake and Amy don\u2019t want to me to be a bridesmaid cause I\u2019m not a traditional woman. I thought it was getting too much so I just decided that I shouldn\u2019t go. Am I sad? Yea, I\u2019ll feel left out but it\u2019s not my wedding and I don\u2019t wanna fight with Jake or Amy about it. My family doesn\u2019t want to go anymore but I said I\u2019ll be fine they can go enjoy the wedding. \n\nAmy did reach out to me yesterday about it.\nShe just said \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t pick you as a bridesmaid because you don\u2019t match my image I want a traditional wedding and you aren\u2019t that\u201d Then going on to how I would make the wedding pictures uneven.\n\n I just responded \u201cI\u2019m not going anymore. I don\u2019t need your reasonings on whatever you think.\u201d I thought this would make Amy happy but she wasn\u2019t. She angry texted in all caps \u201cFUCK YOU. I don\u2019t even know why I consider inviting you. You should be regretting not coming.\u201d Im not sure how to feel. But I\u2019m not alone I was thinking of just going to the beach with my son that day just so I can distract myself. But my whole family all told me I should go to the wedding. I don\u2019t really feel welcome and Jake hasn\u2019t told me anything But AITA for letting this argument with the bride affect my present at her wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yes, you could have simply attended as a guest to keep the peace. You aren't in any way obligated to be a bridesmaid. Of course, we all know that will make you look bad, as everyone will be wondering why you were not allowed to be made the bridesmaid. But by not rocking the boat, you could have gone as a guest. \n\nHowever, I feel opting out for you is finally responding to her nasty ways. You don't mention if you have ever called her out for being nasty, but I am going to assume you have kept quiet to keep the peace. Now, you get the chance to finally let her know that you don't care for how she treats you and will not be silent about it for everyone to see. \n\nGood on you. Next time, give her and your cousin a piece of your mind. I know all of this is focused on her, but I honestly find it hard to believe the cousin has no knowledge of all of this. Or worse, he is so much in her control he will go along with it, just so he doesn't damage their relationship. Those are some of the most complacently dangerous people to be around.

Then because you (and others) removed yourself completely cos of her attitude and behaviour towards you, she thinks a fuck you text and how you'd regret not being there would change your mind?\n\nGood luck to Jake.

She is already a piece of work based solely on the 2 examples of things she's recently said to you. Ew she's horrible. Maybe Jake is too I don't know (I tend to figure people marrying nasty people must either be nasty themselves, stupid or delusional). I'm sorry you have a person marrying into the family who clearly belittles you so unfairly. Normally I'd say a bride has the right to pick the bridesmaids they want, but in this case it's for an AH reason that somehow suggests she thinks she's better than you. She's not, she's a dick. Do whatever is right for you. If others pull out of the wedding too then that's the result of her dickery not yours.", "Honestly, a day at the beach with your son sounds sooo much better than the wedding of some assholes...

I think the rest of the family haven't previously noticed how much she dislikes OP and has been quietly targeting her for criticism. \n\nSo to them, when Jake and Amy talk about getting all of the siblings and cousins into the wedding party, the family thought they meant exactly that. All of the family. Not \"all except the one we don't like and don't want in our photos\". And because Jake and Amy weren't up-front with their decision, and because it's one person very conspicuously left out of what has been trumpeted by one and all as a *family* thing, the family are now shocked and upset that someone they love is being edged out of that family.\n\nAlso, while I support people's right to invite who they want to be a bridesmaid/groomsman/usher/whatever, I also think that right ends at the point where you say you're inviting a whole group but then redefine the definition of the group to exclude someone. \n\nPicking the six people you're closest to out of twenty is a reasonable decision. Picking nineteen people out of twenty, hoping no-one (including the twentieth's sister!) notices that the twentieth isn't there and then admitting that they weren't included because they are overweight, a single mom, and work for a living? That's an objectively terrible decision on several different levels, and of course people are going to be pissed off at the prejudice.", "She\u2019s bullying the OP and trying to alienate them from part of the family. Why would you go somewhere to be bullied? If he knows about it, he\u2019s doing the wrong thing by not calling his fianc\u00e9 out on her behaviour", "Doesn\u2019t sound spiteful. The bride even said she doesn\u2019t want OP in pictures and even thought about not inviting OP. Sounds like Amy just doesn\u2019t want to explain OP\u2019s absence so she herself wouldn\u2019t look bad. Why waste your time on attending a wedding of such a person?", "Oh and grey rock her. Respond with \"Okay. I hope you have a lovely day with no regrets. Best.\"  \n\n\nThen, I would screenshot the conversation, send it to Jake, and apologize for not coming to the wedding, saying, \"I feel like this would be more comfortable for everyone, and while I don't understand the animosity she feels toward me, I can respect that it would be better to simply wish you well. I hope we can connect after the wedding. Take care, your cousin.\" That's it. Then, shut off your phone and plan a nice day at the beach. The rest of it is not your problem, one way or another.", "Show that chat exchange between you and Amy to your family. Her behavior is vile and keeping it to yourself isn't worth the stress.

If you WANT this to happen have a conversation with the most gossipy aunt or cousin where you mention you wont be coming they'll ask why.  You play coy saying something like \"i don't really feel it would be good of me to be showing this right before the wedding.  I don't want to cause any drama.\"  They will push for it harder.

Your family is upset because she purposefully left you out. If they're angry now, then how do you think they're going to feel when you don't even show up. Amy doesn't want to be blamed for anything.

He might not even leave the wedding with her when he wakes up and realizes what she is.", "right!  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I completely agree. Jake has been a quiet bystander, allowing his wife to bully OP. And seemingly has no issue that she\u2019s not going to the wedding anymore.", "I don\u2019t want to fight but whenever she does talk to me it\u2019s always very forceful and she\u2019s always irritated with me.", "I actually get the opposite impression, I think Jake is fully aware. Maybe not of the text exchange specifically, but he\u2019s definitely aware of how awful his fianc\u00e9 has treated his cousin, and he seems completely ok with her not showing up to the wedding. \n\nHe either just doesn\u2019t care at all, or truthfully is hiding behind his wife and cowering away from the situation.", "Jake is getting led along by his little pecker. The small brain is in charge.", "'Cause a single mother who got an education is not \"traditional\" whatever her twisted definition of traditional may be.\n\nOP, take your boy to the beach and celebrate not living in the narrow minded approval range of these people", "Gasp!", "Ahh. Okay. That makes sense. I wasn\u2019t sure. Could have meant several things. I guess I thought it had to do with sexuality because of that wording.", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re amazed that someone asked a valid question?\ud83d\ude02", "Those comments are vile. The next time she says something like that, it should be addressed immediately with, \"You may not like me but when  you are in my presence, you will address me in a civil and kind manner. Your behavior is immature and very inappropriate. Knock it off.\"", "But again, at a wedding, chances of that happening are very low.  Most weddings I've been to, I spoke to the bride and groom for less than 5 minutes that night.  They are doing their thing, mingling with all the guests, etc.", "That\u2019s possible, too. I\u2019m just trying to assume innocence.", "Why would she go, if she is clearly not wanted. Jake is a wimp who should have stood up for his cousin. He doesn't deserve any support and I wouldn't let Amy get her will.", "I disagree.  It seems like the bride goes out of her way to antagonize OP.  OP don't set yourself up.  Go to the beach with your son.  Live your best life and remember, someone who has to make someone unhappy to feel \"happy\" isn't really happy at all.", "Amy said she didn\u2019t want to invite OP in the first place or was at least unsure.", ">  I wouldn't let Amy get her will.\n\nWhat \"will\" is Amy getting here?  It sounds like she doesn't give a shit about OP, so her going or not going probably doesn't affect Amy in any way, but it may bother Jake.  \n\nAnd how should he have stood up?  Forced Amy to have her as a bridesmaid?  That doesn't seem like a good idea either.", "In my experience, brides are too caught up in the moment of their wedding to really be bothered picking a petty fight for no reason.", "Right, and Jake wanted her there so she got an invitation.  \n\nDo you think this is the first wedding ever where one person didn't really want someone there, and the other person made sure they were invited?  Absolutely not.  Hell, I have many friends where part of the couple would've rather not invited a certain friend/family member of the other.  But they were invited anyway and there were no fights.", "I have the feeling she would like OP to attend to show she is not so bad and maybe to leave another comment or twice on how much better she is to OP. OP not coming shows her standing up for herself and putting a stop to Amy bullying her right in front of the relative's noses. Not coming shows, something isn't right instead of sweeping the issues under the rug for appearances. Please excuse wrong commas, I tend to never get them right while writing in English.", "Well lucky you then? There\u2019s literally a whole term for brides being petty and starting fights for no reason.", "This is more about OP not being where she isn\u2019t wanted than being \u2018rewarded\u2019 with a reluctant invitation. She doesn\u2019t seem to be craving attendance but rather doesn\u2019t want to be there.", "Most bridezillas are that leading up to the wedding, not AT the actual wedding. \n\nEven so, there is a term for that because its NOT the norm.", "And that is fine.  If she doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to.  \n\nAll I'm saying is she isn't punishing the person who she doesn't like, she is punishing the person she does like and who does want her there."]}
