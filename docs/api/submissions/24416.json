I'm out of makeup so I gave her yours so she can be a kid and be creative.\"\n\nNTA. Stand your ground. Makeup is expensive. Make this situation a problem for your mom as well and things will sort themselves out lmao.", "NTA. Start taking your mom\u2019s good make-up.  When she inevitably figures out what you are doing and asks you why or tells you to stop, give her the most innocent questioning child like face you can pull off and say, \u2018But mom, we share makeup in this family, right?\u2019", "NTA. I remember being 12 - she absolutely understands why ruining your things is wrong and does it on purpose", "NTA tell your mom she owes you money or replacement products for anything she ruins and get a lockbox to secure your makeup if possible.", "NTA - You can't \"borrow\" makeup. Makeup gets used and then it is gone. \"Borrow\" suggests that she is going to give it back. Tell your mom and her BF that you would be happy to help SS pick out some things and show her how to use them, but THEY have to pay for it all. If they want to let her be creative, they need to cover the cost. Invest in a locked makeup case and keep an inventory of what you have and what you paid for it.", "NTA- I don't understand parents and stepparents that act like yours are doing. You bought it with your money. They can buy her makeup if they want her to have it.", "Take your mom's stuff and put it in your room where she can get it", "NTA. Tell them it's your money and she's destroying them. making them unusable. *They* can purchase makeup for her.", "Honestly, I would be super tempted to sacrifice something and tamper with it. I\u2019m talking like an eyebrow gel with hair remover levels of meddling. Yes I\u2019m petty af. \n\nNTA", "NTA and at 17 it is very reasonable to expect a higher level of privacy and respect for your things that you've earned. Maybe 12 looks up to you and wants to be like you...? But she's only 12 so she's going about it the wrong way. Talk to your parents rationally and see if a compromise can be made about getting your key back. Maybe offer to spend a little quality time with 12 once a week as long as your boundaries about your room are respected. If that doesn't work, get a file cabinet with a lock and just lock your important stuff up in there. They even make them with wheels so you can wheel it into your closet when you're not using it and it's out of sight.", "NTA\n\nGet a lockbox!", "Tell your mom that *she* should lend her makeup to your sister. Let\u2019s see how quick she changes her tune\n\nNTA", "NTA. She's destroyed  your stuff. If her Dad wants her to have access to make up and skin care products, he should buy her some of her own.  Buy a lockbox for the things you need to protect. And save your receipts.\n\nAnother thought - you could take your damagedd products to your mother. Tell her that you will give them to your stepsister IF your mother will replace them for you. And the next time you go shopping, you will let your mother know and IF she will send you the money for it, you will buy some for her bfs daughter.  Hopefully, once she sees the cost, she will be more on  your side.", "NTA. You need to explain to your Mother and sister that one should never, ever share make up. You risk things like herpes from lip products and bacterial infections from eye products (think pink eye).  And while pink eye is curable, herpes is not.  It can also result in skin breakouts and irritation. This is the very reason why many places, like Sephora have either Eliminated testers, or provide individual testing options, so as to avoid cross-contamination. If your 12-year-old stepsister had used your make up then you should probably consider it contaminated, and either she or your mother should replace it. A 12 year olds hygiene probably isn\u2019t anywhere near as good as yours. As soon as she starts getting acne, tell her it\u2019s because she used to make it, that might scare her away from it if your parents aren\u2019t willing to do anything. In the meantime, hide your stuff.", "NTA. Growing up with 3 sisters I can relate. \n\nMaybe hide the nice one and keep out some decoy cheaper ones where she can see and think she\u2019s getting away with using your makeup.", "NTA, here's an idea, your mom & her bf can buy the little one her own makeup! Let them see how expensive it is. And I think she's a bit immature wearing makeup if she had a meltdown over a locked door.", "Tell then if they want you to share then they have to pay. Otherwise you are charging theft of property.  She's not asking. She's going behind your back.", "NTA", "NTA aside from everyone else pointing out how she's stealing from you, it's incredibly unhygienic to share makeup like this, especially eye makeup. You could easily get some kind of eye infection from this.", "NTA.  Your sister is not just borrowing your makeup, she's destroying it and/or using it up.  She's quite a bit younger and this is play for her.  Totally not okay for your parents to not enforce boundaries that she not touch ANY of your products unless you are asked and agree.  \n\nYour sister is definitely NOT entitled to take, use, or hide YOUR makeup as she wishes.  This is an important boundary she needs to learn and you deserve more respect in controlling how your makeup supplies are used.  Makes it even worse if you paid for these items yourself as makeup is not cheap.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
