However, we lived in a no-fault divorces state at the time, which meant that my father was dragged to the jurisdictional hell of family court and loosing his livelihood. My mom was a stay at home wife with no income and conveniently enough she did not remember my half sister's biological father, so to add insult to injury my father was ordered to pay child support and spousal support (for whole 5 years).\n\nMy father was financially devastated after months. So to rebuild his life, he left the United States, back to Asia where my grandparents came from and which does not enforce Child support or spousal support obligation ordered by US courts.\n\nThe situation had now changed, because the fact my mom had no job skills, she could not continue her lavish lifestyle which my father provided in the marriage and after the divorce. She was relying on social benefits and had to work in low income retail-jobs.\n\nI was on the other hand cared for and continue my trade school, living with my uncle.

Of course, I am still in contact with my father and visit him in my vacation, he remarried a Vietnamese woman 4 years ago, and they have a baby boy, of course I have some couple of pictures which I have hanged around my house, simply due to the fact I like my stepmom and my baby brother, she is always hospital towards me and my baby brother is just the cutest baby you can imagine.\n\nMy mom, as she is, is not only insulting her but also my father, the breaking point for me was yesterday, as I came back home from work and saw all the pictures on MY WALLS, in the trash bin.

Thus, if he decided not to go through this process, then he might still be paying child support, but the overwhelming likelihood is that if he decided to let it in forces right to have paternity, determined, based on fraud or inappropriate marital conduct that the court have no choice but to allow them to at least go through the process which means a DNA test", "Different states have different laws, but even when the husband is definitively proven not to be the father, he can still be ordered to pay child support.
