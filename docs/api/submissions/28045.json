We love kids but hearing her sisters' description of childbirth put her off the idea of experiencing it herself permanently, so we never had a talk about raising a kid at all. Until one of her sisters got arrested and sent to prison, that is.\n\nSo now me and my wife are looking after her sister's 13 years old son. My wife started getting quite strict. She limited screen time to 1 hour per day, excluding news and documentaries. Those she allows him to watch as much as he likes since it's informative.\n\nHe has his school books and exercise books but nothing else to read or do in spare time, except for the things mentioned above. Only study, study and study till he's exhausted, and then she tells him to keep on studying. There is violin, but I'm not exactly sure that counts since he doesn't want to practice. It's his mom's insistence that he keeps going to lessons.\n\nI figured he could use some breaks though so I bought him a fantasy novel that I saw him looking up online so he could have something fun to read and enjoy too but my wife said I shouldn't distract him from school stuff with 'fantasy nonsense'. That was when I told her she's being way too strict, and that he should have breaks and be able to do other stuff too. She got mad at me, saying she is the one related to him by blood while I'm only related because I'm married to her. My wife said that because of that fact, she should have a bigger say than I do.\n\nWas she right in what she said? I've known him as long as she has but does her being the one actually related to him by blood make her opinion more important?\n\nUPDATE : I talked to her about this after dinner. Started by telling her that I agree academics is important but then I said her method is going to make him burn out. I told her that kids need to decompress and deserve some fun too. At first she seemed to annoyed so I tried a different tactic and warned her that if she keeps this up one day he\u2019ll be resentful and refuse to talk to her. That seemed to give her pause so I\u2019m going to give her some time to think about it before pressing further.", "created_utc": 1696212536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xk8yj/aita_for_contradicting_my_wife_regarding_our/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife is controlling and also closed minded about what has educational value. While I believe in reading because it is fun, I am an also educator and know reading fantasy novels has educational benefits, just like reading non fiction. \n\nThey inspire creativity and promote analytical skills, especially looking at the development of characters and looking at how authors weave multiple themes into their work. \n\nAlso, they are fun to read! And one of the best things you can do to support a kids education is build a love of reading. Avid readers often have stronger reading comprehension which make them better test takers.\n\nFinally, having fun and having hobbies is important for mental health and preventing burn out.", "NTA. \n\nHe is 13. He doesn't play sports, have board games, Legos, books for fun? Anything? That is ridiculous. Go buy the kid some things he will enjoy. He days should be school, reasonable household chores (cleaning up after himself and helping with a household chore), activities, homework and then free time. And sometimes free time should come first, especially on weekends. Your wife is creating more trauma for an already traumatized child. He isn't a robot. He also needs some unstructured time with his peers. Trips to the movies, the skate park, whatever he is into.", "She is being over the top which isn't going to do that kid any favors. NTA.", "Your wife is at risk of veering into abusive territory in a misguided attempt to keep him from making the same mistakes his mother did. Time for therapy for her, the nephew and possibly parenting classes for both. That poor kid is already going through a LOT and now he's being berated about spending 100% of his time studying and doing violin, which he doesn't want to do, by a mother who is in jail.", "NTA, your wife is mentally abusing that child and is going to damage his mental health.  Fun and happyness are key to developing the mind. And  many works of fiction explore the human condition far better then educational works, its why literature is part of education in the first place. The same go's for painting, music. All you are doing now is building a burnout/runaway. What is the point of studying if it makes you worse off? It sounds like your wife is dealing with some serious insecurities and resentment. \n\nYou are in a relationship of equals ( I assume) so you should share this responsiblity as equals as well. Or is she going to pay all his expenses and require any of your time, space or rescources.", "NTA. Hell no. She needs to respect you as a partner and an adult. Your nephew is going to grow up to hate her if she doesn't chill her little funky attitude out right now. I mean an hour for screen time at 13 that's really not that bad I mean I would say you know maybe give him a couple chores like he could do the dishes at night and then give him like an extra half an hour or hour or something like that. Absolutely for news and documentaries that are formative that's good too but he also has to have some break time and some time to actually be a kid and be a human being and not a walking f****** computer.

And you might be the only friend this poor kid has now.  He shouldn't be punished for whatever his mother did - your wife is mad at her sister, and she thinks controlling this kids life is going to make up for it.  Kids need social lives too, and they need more than study - just like adults need more than just going to work every day.  He might be related to her, but he isn't her child, and he lives in your house so you are just as much a 'parent' to him as she is.", "this is something that you both should cooperate on and come to a decision that works for both uou guys and the kid so he isn\u2019t miserable. being blood related doesn\u2019t really mean anything in the situation unless the kid needs a kidney.", "NTA, if she feels that way maybe you should leave and she can be the only one in charge just like she wants", "NTA.\n\nGuess it's good you're not planning on kids of your own.", "NTA.", "NTA. \nI had a pushy parent. I resented it and resisted where I was able. Even when I knew it would cost me some form of punishment I would purposely fail tests.. \nI become cold and distant and disconnected from them for being pushed so much with no balance of fun or things to look forward to. Once I was out of the family home I pretty much dropped contact as I had nothing but anger and resentment toward them.  Study is important but it isn\u2019t the only thing that is important. Balance - fun and entertainment with responsibilities and homework and good grades.", "NTA and as an educational psychologist, she's putting too much stress on him. Without fun time, engaging in actual interests, he could end up rebelling, depressed, over stressed, etc. People NEED releases, to decompress. He's young still but should be supported in other interests. And as he gets older, if she continues like this, he'll resent her more and more. \n\nWhat is wrong with reading other things? She is absolutely wrong. If he likes the fantasy book, get him another when he's done!!! He can read my trilogies :D", "Nta\n\nRemind her that when you got married you became a unit so she shouldn't be so dismissive of marriage.  Because it's this bond of marriage that allowed you  to want what's best for her nephew too.  \n\nAnd while you understand that she is doing what she thinks is best, she needs to allow him free time  to develop social skills and interests like other people his age.  \n\nHe isn't a robot.", "NTA, help that boy", "NTA.

This is abusive as fuck.\n\nNta", "Wow. Does your wife want him to hate school and resent her? That's where she's headed. He's a kid for crying out loud and kids need time to play. \n\nTake him outside and play basketball with him. It doesn't matter if you aren't any good. It will get him out of the house, away from the book general and perhaps you can get him to open up.\n\nI'm sure he's got some issues going on that he's not dealing with. All that repression, he's going to be acting out soon. He's not going to reach out to his aunt because all she will tell him is to study more.\n\nBTW, NTA.

Or find another activity outside of the house for him that he enjoys. Give the kid a break and some freedom.", "NTA. That kid is going to rebel like crazy if he doesn't have balance.

He needs to be allowed to be a kid while he is one.\n\nBTW, my husband and I have been together 25 years, and all of the nieces and nephews are *ours.* Period.

I\u2019ve never had a relative go to prison, but I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s easy especially when it\u2019s your parent and depending on how serious the crime and how much time they have. Having fun outlets outside of studying in my eyes is highly important to help process and/or distract from negative emotions around the situation.

Not to mention any bullying from peers over having an incarcerated parent. \n\nIf they continue with this \u201conly study and no fun\u201d track, they are only adding stress to what I imagine is an already stressful situation.

She is stunting his intellectual growth as developing a love of reading can encourage a person to broaden their educational interests. \n\nDoes your nephew like sports at all? Are there youth leagues in his areas of interest where he could join a team? The benefits are making friends and benefits being physically active. \n\nHow about getting him involved in a volunteer activity? This helps him become more well rounded and will help his eventual application to colleges. \n\nYou and your wife are in a position to be a tremendous role model for your nephew but your wife is far too busy playing warden. I would be thinking how can we position him to grow up into a successful independent adult. Your wife's tactics will not do that and may ultimately drive him away as soon as he is old enough to leave. \n\nYour nephew is lucky that you are trying to advocate for him. It has to be really difficult to stand by and watch the way that she is treating him.", "NTA. There was a period of time where I was massively grounded and I was around your nephew\u2019s age. I wasn\u2019t allowed any time with friends, no tv, nothing that wasn\u2019t school, chores, or church stuff. I couldn\u2019t talk on the phone, no computer time. This was around 2000, so cell phones and social media wasn\u2019t really a thing. And I wasn\u2019t allowed many books because they were my escape and my parents knew that taking books was always a harsh punishment for me. \n\nWant the spoiler? I had had something traumatic happen that caused my grades to slip, and the grades resulted in the grounding. I felt so alone and isolated that I made a try to self delete. I got very lucky and didn\u2019t succeed, obviously. It took a year for me to get the courage to beg for help. Wasn\u2019t grounded by then, but there was a lot of shame in admitting how low I got. \n\nEverything has changed for him. He\u2019s living with you guys, he doesn\u2019t have his mom around, he may have had to change schools. He needs something that\u2019s an outlet for the pressure and you guys have a chance to help him pick good things. Otherwise, he\u2019s going to pick something bad.

For they were strict with them and never let them balance their life with a bit more fun. I don't blame kids like that, being forced to study every hour of every day is boring and not a life to have as a child.\n\nThirdly- Opie, sit your wife down and explain to her stubborn self that what she said was uncalled for and whether your not related to her nephew by blood, does not make you any less of a guardian to him.

She is severely neglecting his needs with her laser focus on academics. \n\nIf she wants to parent him on her own, she shouldn't be doing it while supposedly having you, her *partner* around. It's very disrespectful to dismiss your concerns and turn the health and development of a child into a power struggle or something based on her personal feelings with absolutely nothing to back it up and a refusal to compromise. \n\nHonestly, seeing a family therapist would be a great idea to help everyone adjust to all the changes.

With their parents having issues that child is likely pretty stressed.\n Drawing paper, coloring pencils. Things like that too can be a stress release.\n\nAnd things can decompress and expand the mind.  A library card is free too.  Reading will also increase his vocabulary.  Coloring, drawing can be applied to any number of things.\n\nAround that age also cooking can be an outlet and something fun to do.

These activities also help kids identify their strengths and weaknesses, their interests and passions.  This helps them choose education and career paths in the future.  And we all need some fun and relaxation.  Does your wife work at a job, then come home and cook and clean and spend all her time on chores until she drops into bed exhausted?  Probably not.\nMight be worth reflecting on and discussing how you were brought up.  Was she raised this strictly?  Was her sister the rebellious screw up who\u2019s come to no good?  Are her parents insisting this is the way to raise the boy?\nKeep advocating for a more balanced approach to raising your nephew, letting him do extracurriculars if HIS choice, try new things without pressure to be the best, and just relax and have some fun.", "Op, is your wife possibly overcompensating with the rules due to his mother veering off the legal path? \n\nI feel like she either thinks he\u2019s had a crap academic foundation so far and is determined to give him something he hasn\u2019t had for a bright future (truancy, failing grades, homework/studying expectations). OR she\u2019s being over the top strict as to try to prevent any type of idle time where he may be exposed to anything but school work and become a criminal like his mom?\n\nRegardless, this kid deserves a social life, a stable/safe home to lay his head, and of course entertainment that he enjoys. \n\nIt\u2019s a balancing act. He will not be successful or be able to cope in the real world without developing the age appropriate knowledge learned through experience and interaction. \n\nAnd yes, 100%, he\u2019ll resent and hate your wife bc of how she\u2019s controlling him and just because she\u2019s \u201ca blood relative \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude12\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t write her off.", "I am flabbergasted by all of it, but especially with the reading thing, because it\u2019s SO incorrect. ALL reading is good reading, and only helps kids academically. I was diagnosed as dyslexic as a kid, and had a hard time learning to read. I loved stories, which pushed me to decode reading. I didn\u2019t want to have to wait for my parents to finish reading a book to me. When I was 8, I could barely read. By the time I was in 6th grade, I was on a college reading level, because my parents let me read anything, and everything that struck my fancy. It made me a voracious reader. They never talked about reading levels or said something was \u201ctoo easy\u201d or \u201ctoo hard\u201d for me, which meant I was reading Goosebumps and Oliver Twist at the same time. I didn\u2019t know that Oliver Twist was supposed to be hard. I found it on a bookshelf at my grandparents\u2019 house. We need to stop both pushing kids too hard, and limiting them too much.", "I can't upvote this enough. All reading is good reading.", "I had an English teacher who disagreed. She wanted to control what we read in our 'free time'. \n\nThis is why I didn't take English Literature A-Level. I have no regrets."]}
