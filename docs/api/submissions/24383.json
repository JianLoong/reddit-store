We have been living together for just over a year.\n\nI have always been fond of cooking and usually make a lot of Asian dishes as I grew up eating a lot of them. So as a result I do use soy sauce and sometimes some msg. However when I got together with my bf he has mentioned how he is very allergic to soy, so I had to be extra careful what I make. He has also mentioned how his parents dismissed his allergy and we had a long discussion about his allergies. I take allergies seriously due to an incident with a family member a few years ago, so when we moved in together I ended up purchasing an entire new cooking set to make sure there's no cross contamination.\n\nLast week we went to see his family as they invited us over to their place. I have met them before and we had lunch together at a local restaurant, however we haven't visited them due to how far they live.\n\nDuring the visit Jack went to pick up his brother from a gig (our car is 2 seater), so I was there with his mother \"Annie\" while she was making a BBQ. At some point I saw her adding a lot of soy sauce to the marinade for all the meat and said she can't do that as Jack is allergic to soy sauce, meaning he won't be able to eat it. Annie said not to worry and that Jack loves this marinada and she already made the first bunch. I have reminded her again that Jack can not eat it as it is not safe for him, in short we ended up in an argument until Jack came back. When Jack returned he was confused why am I arguing with his mother and ate one of the glazed wings in the marinade. I was shocked and tried to tell him they have soy, but he said do not worry as they are very tasty and he is fine. I have asked about the allergies and he said he didn't have any and just doesn't always like it in his food as sometimes food tastes very salty with it. Now his entire family are calling me a controlling asshole and demand a proper apology to Annie for \"insulting her cooking\".

If anything *you* deserve an apology for them lying about an allergy to avoid food being \"salty\". This is not about Annie's cooking or you being controlling, this is about Jack manipulating and controlling you. He misled you and lied to you about his parents minimising his \"allergy\". Now they're all blaming you for trying to protect Jack and Jack is *letting it happen* so he doesn't have to admit to his family that he is a liar and an AH.\n\nJack is willing to manipulate you and lie to you to get what he wants about his food preference.

OP thought she was potentially saving his life.", "NTA, Jack is. Soy is in so much food. If he just doesn't like soy sauce he could have explained that. Faking an allergy is a crappy thing to do (exception being if it is a trigger for something serious, but even then explain that to an SO, maybe not in a restaurant), faking one where cross contact needs to be avoided is even worse.", "I hate soy sauce but claiming to be dangerously allergic for years, letting my partner buy new cookware, avoiding soy products when with my partner at the restaurant and then casually eating it at my mum's and saying I never had any allergy as if she were a nut case sounds borderline psycho.", "NTA, but he\u2019s obviously not allergic to soy.", "NTA.

I could die if I accidently eat to much of the wrong thing.   \n Throughout my life I have had to contend with people who are convinced that it's just all in my head.

There are reasons for this, but mostly because people like the boyfriend, fake allergies and get others thinking that all allergies must be fake.", "NTA. What your boyfriend has done to you is terrible, it cost you significant stress plus a whole new cooking set. He fully lied to you, manipulated you and for what?

The apology you owe his Mother is that she raised a lying little rat! Honestly OP this is a legitimate reason to break up. He lied about something very serious; all you did was try to keep him safe using the information he gave you! As others have said if he\u2019ll lie about something like this you can\u2019t trust him. He had no reason to lie; a lot of people don\u2019t like soy & there\u2019s nothing wrong with that but go the whole nine yards and say he got an allergy to it is just wrong on so many levels.

It\u2019s annoying when a \u201cnew\u201d person comes into a family and believes they know more about a person than their family. This is why you should always tread lightly here. You should have realized something was off when his *mother* said that he loves her sauce. If he was allergic to soy, it\u2019s likely that his mom should have known\u2026no? You should have immediately backed off and double checked with Jack again instead of arguing with his mom\u2026.in her home\u2026at her bbq. Which leads me to #2\u2026.\n\n2. Even if Jack was allergic, his mom is allowed to cook whatever she wants in her home. You don\u2019t have any authority here, and, as a guest, you should not argue with her about her menu.

They had been together for 2 years at the time of the last real blow up. He would hide a lot of stuff from her (nothing nefarious) because he was still trying to impress her and/or not hurt her feelings. She would then try to aggressively confront us in the name of protecting him and then would have to apologize once we made him come clean. But, it\u2019s hard to let it go when you have someone attack you and accuse you of intentionally harming someone you love.

He's just lying.", "He didn\u2019t even just make her look bad, he made her look crazy to his family when he\u2019s the liar.", "This is not an example of gaslighting.", "It's really embarrassing in this day and age that people continue to misuse the word \"Gaslighting\"\n\n Seriously folks. Look up what it means. It doesn't apply to this situation.", "People like to just use that word when \"lying\" doesn't sound sinister enough. It's ridiculous.", "I dunno. First he lied. Then he gaslit her.  \n\nI think it is both.", "Your judgement makes more sense now that it\u2019s clear you can\u2019t read.", "Considering Jack was constantly telling her how his mother doesn\u2019t take his allergies seriously and it\u2019s literally his health in danger, I think OP handled it reasonably. Jack is a psycho who set her up to be humiliated. He didn\u2019t just lie about the allergy, he made up a story about how other people don\u2019t take his allergies seriously and he is at risk. That is insanely fucked up", "It\u2019s not. If he would have been gaslighting her, he would have said he never told her that. Gaslighting doesn\u2019t just mean lying, it means making the other person question their sanity or knowledge of events."]}
