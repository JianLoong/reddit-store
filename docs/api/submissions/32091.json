Recently, he and I decided to start trying for our first baby and I decided to let my sister know seeing as how she will likely still be in the house when baby is born.\n\nAbout my sister: I love her to bits but we couldn\u2019t be more different from one another. I am Autistic, struggle with socializing and prefer quiet and only really being with family. My sister has ADHD, is very social and very opinionated, very quick witted and always cracking jokes. She is 21 and I am 24. She and I have had a period where we were estranged and didn\u2019t speak for years but we\u2019ve managed to be back on speaking terms and be close again.\n\nLast night I got a little annoyed because anytime I have brought up wanting children, my sister has been highly critical of me and my partner, saying we shouldn\u2019t have kids for reasons x y and z, but what really bothers me is her \u201cjokes\u201d about bullying my kids and having \u201cbeef\u201d with them because she doesn\u2019t like the names we picked out, she\u2019s also made \u201cjokes\u201d out leaving trauma on them by treating them coldly and ignoring them.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is how she handles her pet cat, whos not even a year old yet, she frequently shakes him, drops him and throws him on her bed. She\u2019ll call her cat stupid or retarded or dumb and then say she\u2019s joking.\n\nThis stuff has all made me worried about having her around my baby, because I\u2019d like my children not potentially hurt. I asked her to be gentle and to not shake my baby. She got REALLY offended.\n\nWe proceeded into having a long discussion where she told me I need to think about the implications behind the questions I ask, because now that I\u2019ve \u201cthrown that accusation\u201d out there she wants nothing to do with my baby and doesn\u2019t want to be near them. I tried to explain my reasoning, and she told me pets are different than babies and I shouldn\u2019t expect her to treat a baby the way she treats her cat. I explained the jokes she made making me uncomfortable, she said she feels she can never talk to me right because my Autism makes me incapable of reading tone and thats a part of herself she doesn\u2019t want to change.\n\nI\u2019m genuinely confused and I do acknowledge I struggle with social interaction and unintentionally hurting people\u2019s feelings, but my concerns with her were genuine and they were bothering me and I can\u2019t just pretend I\u2019m not bothered.\n\nWhat does anyone think? I\u2019m happy to answer more questions if needed. I want to know what I did wrong or what she did or possibly both.", "created_utc": 1701384901, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187vsis/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_not_shake_my_baby/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should rehome that poor kitty. \n\nAnd I wouldn't let her within a mile of your baby. There's something wrong with her. \n\nNTA", "Be an adult and tell her to move out.", "Sounds like your sister is emotional unstable and shouldn't be around vulnerable people or animals, including her cat and your future baby. Since she even said she doesn't want to be near the baby, it's time for her to find a new place to live.

You are NTA. I wouldn't want her in the house tbh.", "NTA, but it is also possible that your sister isn't mistreating the cat.  I'd have to see how she interacts with the kitten, but some cats enjoy roughhousing in a way that could look offputting if you didn't know the cat and human.  Cats generally play with variations of play-hunting and play-fighting, so I would have to see what the \"dropping\" and \"tossing\" the cat looked like to see if the cat was participating voluntarily, and landing in ways that showed that the two of them were playing consensually.\n\nAnd obviously, human babies can't be played with that way.\n\nSo, let me offer a possible interpretation.  To be clear, I can't know that this is what is going on, but it is one possibility that fits the facts that you have presented:\n\nThere is a possibility that this is a context confusion - that your sister is having appropriate interactions with the cat, and you were applying those interactions to a potential human.  And she had no intention of applying the one set of interactions to the other context, and was insulted that you thought there was a possibility that she would.  Interacting with a human baby in the same manner as interacting with a kitten would injure the human baby, and she felt like you were saying that she didn't know that.  A person who didn't know that interacting with a human baby that way would be extremely ignorant; a person who didn't care would be extremely cruel.\n\nYou felt that you had to tell her that.  So, to her, that would suggest that you thought there was a possibility that she was either extremely ignorant or extremely cruel, and she felt offended that you thought she was either ignorant or cruel.\n\nLike I said, that is simply a possibility, a model which fits the facts as presented.  It's not the only possible model, but if it is correct, it would suggest that there isn't a fundamental serious problem here, just a misunderstanding of context.", "NTA. This is YOUR child first and always. You need to tell your sister that if she can\u2019t listen respectfully and follow the boundaries you have put in place she doesn\u2019t need a relationship with your child. I had to do that with my mom because she isn\u2019t respectful of my boundaries and I would stress everytime she was around my son and I. So think about this (this is what I asked myself also), is the anxiety and stress that this person is causing worth the relationship with my child? You should feel happy and good when people are around your baby, not stressed and worried what\u2019s going to happen. Put your foot down now, you are not the villain here I promise. This is a living, breathing, little human, it\u2019s your job to protect them, even if it\u2019s from people who you think love you.", "NTA. Please toss your Autism out the window when considering this issue. Your concerns are accurate and very, very justified. \n\nHow people treat defenseless animals can be an indicator of how he/she will treat a small defenseless human. If she shakes the baby, who has no upper body strength and absolutely zero head/neck control for quite a while, then the damage can easily be permanent, or even fatal.\n\nYour post sounds like a very loving and reasonable mother-to-be. I admire you for addressing the issue now in a direct manner. Many people are not brave enough to have the hard conversations when needed, especially with family members.\n\nI agree with the earlier comments. Your sister needs to move out. When the baby arrives, it will be physically impossible (and bad for your health) for you to stay side-by-side with the baby 100% of the time. You need rest and sleep whenever possible and that won't happen if you're worried sick about your sister's behavior around your child.\n\nI wish you the best and your post indicates that you're a kind and generous person.

If your sister cannot seem to control her tongue or her actions around the people and animals she supposedly loves, you are right to be concerned for the safety of your children.\n\nAlso, it might be time to phase her out of the house if possible. I can\u2019t imagine trying to build a family with her living under your roof won\u2019t strain your relationship with her.", "NTA. She's joking about causing your future child/children emotional trauma. Shei s seriously risking hurting your cat. If anybody did that to my cats I'd be about 2 inches from their nose telling them that if they did that again they are going to learn the hard way just how bad my temper can get. She doesn't sound like she has respect for anybody or anything frankly and I wouldn't trust her around a baby.\n\n\\*edit- I'm very tired. I just realized this is her cat she treats like crap. Frankly that makes it worse in my opinion...", "Uh. She \u201cshakes\u201d her cat and throws him??? And verbally abuses him? And makes comments about abusing your future babies? Anyone who abuses innocent animals is capable of hurting anyone. Period. Your sister is scary, my friend. She lacks empathy. She sounds mean, and she sounds like she has some serious issues that need to be addressed. She is a bully. She treats you like shit. And then she gaslights you. \n\nProtect your peace.
