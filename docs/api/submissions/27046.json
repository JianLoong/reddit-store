They don\u2019t get to push off their responsibilities on to you.", "i think your attitude kinda sucks cos it really seems like you just dont like your stepdaughter \n\nHowever, youre still NTA cos even tho youre at home most of the time and can build your schedule more or less the way you want to, you are still very much working. Asking you to babysit during these times is the same as asking someone to watch a child in their office at their job. \n\nEDIT: so as not to reply more. i was unclear. i dont think OPs attitude about whats being demanded of her sucks. i only think that the way this reads is that she doesnt like her stepdaughter in the first place, which sucks cos she married her father. If you dont like someones children (which is totally fine) you probably shouldnt marry their parent. Cos a parent is a parent until theyre gone. \n\nOP is entirely correct that this is not her problem and the 3 adults whose problem it is needs to figure it tf out between themselves and leave her out of it.", "NTA. Your husband is out of line.", "NTA.  Would it be nice if you could help with childcare?  Yes.  But the child is simply not your responsibility.\n\nThe stepdaughter decided to have this child and she (and the child's father) is responsible for finding childcare.  Her own mother won't move with her, her father won't change his working hours, so I don't understand why you're being pressured to step in.  \n\nYou have a job.  You may be able to switch your working hours, but you're still going to have to work.  If you take on childcare, then you're going to be doing that and working in whatever hours are left while the child's mother and grandparents get to keep having their same old schedules.\n\nIt is shocking that you're being pressured to do this.  Don't give in.  The stepdaughter could go to a college closer to her mother.  Her mother could move to your state.  Your husband could change his hours.  The child's father and his family could step in.  You are the last person out of all these people who should be responsible.", "YTA, but mostly because of your attitude towards your stepdaughter. For the record, some post-secondary education institutions have a daycare facility either on-campus or they work with one nearby.  \n\nWhy are you holding your stepdaughter\u2019s mistakes against her? Don\u2019t you think her going to university to get an education to have a shot at living life is atonement enough?", "NTA your husband is paying her tuition, room & board.

I absolutely hate when people decide to have kids and then make the kids everyone else\u2019s problem. She decided to have the kid and at her age im sure she knew at the very minimum the child would require alot of sacrifices and time. She chose to have the child so she needs to deal with it. If that means she has to get a job and put off school until the child is of school age and frees up some time? Then that is what she must do. She is family, that doeent mean she gets to take advantage and dump her responsibilities on other people. This is why you dont have sex if you arent ready for children. If youre out there having sex then youre doing so with the understanding that, pregnancy is a possibility and the child is your responsibility and yours alone. NOT THE ASSHOLE OP. \n\nIf anything she and the husband are. How dare he volunteer you to watch her kid and not ask you. Then guilt you when you set a boundary. Honestly it\u2019s shameful", "NTA. Not your monkeys, not your circus. Your husband is TA for throwing this on you, your stepdaughter\u2019s mom is TA for absolving herself of responsibility just because she moved, and your step daughter is TA for not figuring her shit out herself.  If it were your daughter, as her mother, you would help her out because that is what you do when you are a parent. He is disrespecting you and your career with his attitude.

No, you do not get a cheerleading squad because you're going to college like most other people in their teens and twenties.  The OP did not decide to have this child and the person who did decide to have the child has two parents.  \n\nWould it be nice if the OP could do the childcare?  Yes.  But she can't.  The only reason everyone thinks she can is that she has flexible hours.  What will happen will be that the OP ends up doing childcare and squeezing work in around it while the actual grandparents do zero.\n\nThe stepdaughter decided to have this child and she and the child's father need to figure out a solution that doesn't put the responsibility on someone who doesn't want it.", "I am not aware of the full details but he is either still 17 or just turned 18 but yeah he can't do anything atm he didn't even move with her.
