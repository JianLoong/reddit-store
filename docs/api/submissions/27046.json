They don\u2019t get to push off their responsibilities on to you.", "i think your attitude kinda sucks cos it really seems like you just dont like your stepdaughter \n\nHowever, youre still NTA cos even tho youre at home most of the time and can build your schedule more or less the way you want to, you are still very much working. Asking you to babysit during these times is the same as asking someone to watch a child in their office at their job.", "NTA. Your husband is out of line.", "NTA.  Would it be nice if you could help with childcare?  Yes.  But the child is simply not your responsibility.\n\nThe stepdaughter decided to have this child and she (and the child's father) is responsible for finding childcare.  Her own mother won't move with her, her father won't change his working hours, so I don't understand why you're being pressured to step in.  \n\nYou have a job.  You may be able to switch your working hours, but you're still going to have to work.  If you take on childcare, then you're going to be doing that and working in whatever hours are left while the child's mother and grandparents get to keep having their same old schedules.\n\nIt is shocking that you're being pressured to do this.  Don't give in.  The stepdaughter could go to a college closer to her mother.  Her mother could move to your state.  Your husband could change his hours.  The child's father and his family could step in.  You are the last person out of all these people who should be responsible.", "YTA, but mostly because of your attitude towards your stepdaughter. For the record, some post-secondary education institutions have a daycare facility either on-campus or they work with one nearby.  \n\nWhy are you holding your stepdaughter\u2019s mistakes against her? Don\u2019t you think her going to university to get an education to have a shot at living life is atonement enough?", "NTA your husband is paying her tuition, room & board. Where is the baby\u2019s father? Why isn\u2019t he paying child support for the baby to to to daycare.", "NTA she have two parents they can help with babysitting fee .", "NTA. I absolutely hate when people decide to have kids and then make the kids everyone else\u2019s problem. She decided to have the kid and at her age im sure she knew at the very minimum the child would require alot of sacrifices and time. She chose to have the child so she needs to deal with it. If that means she has to get a job and put off school until the child is of school age and frees up some time? Then that is what she must do. She is family, that doeent mean she gets to take advantage and dump her responsibilities on other people. This is why you dont have sex if you arent ready for children. If youre out there having sex then youre doing so with the understanding that, pregnancy is a possibility and the child is your responsibility and yours alone. NOT THE ASSHOLE OP. \n\nIf anything she and the husband are. How dare he volunteer you to watch her kid and not ask you. Then guilt you when you set a boundary. Honestly it\u2019s shameful", "NTA. Not your monkeys, not your circus. Your husband is TA for throwing this on you, your stepdaughter\u2019s mom is TA for absolving herself of responsibility just because she moved, and your step daughter is TA for not figuring her shit out herself.  If it were your daughter, as her mother, you would help her out because that is what you do when you are a parent. He is disrespecting you and your career with his attitude. That would the line for me. I would leave if it doesn\u2019t get better.", "Nta", "NTA. You are right. They are trying to solve the problem by making you the solution", "I can't imagine a husband who can't help his own daughter when she is indeed too tbh. Did your step father step while your mother got herself out of it or did he step up with your mother?", "Do you couldn\u2019t imagine being married to someone who when you look at them and tell them \u201cyou\u2019re going to be taking care of my grandchild now because your work isn\u2019t as important since you are doing it at home. I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t value you or the effort you\u2019ve put into creating a profitable business for yourself because my grandchild comes first.\u201d ?!?! Because that\u2019s what they are saying. Did your step dad have to quit his job to take care of your nibbling every day? Or did he just babysit when he was off work?", "Time of need is doctors appointments, car trouble, job interviews. University is a year, if not years of hours each day. It\u2019s asking (in this case, expecting) A LOT", "Op's being voluntold to babysit.  Why should she have to babysit?", "Strongly disagree, op is NTA, not her circus, not her monkeys. She doesn\u2019t blame her stepdaughter for going in college and move on with life, she blame the parents for dropping \u00ab\u00a0all\u00a0\u00bb the work with the child on her, and that\u2019s fair.", "It's not OP's responsibility as her stepdaughter has fully capable parents who can help her out, by for example hiring a nanny or helping in finding a good daycare.", "In the US the daughter could apply for govt housing, assistance with utilitites, free daycare and so much more. It may take time to get them but she could apply and get on the list. OP is being told she will be a full time babysitter. OP\u2019s job is being put on the back burner without her permission to raise stepkiddo\u2019s child. OP is being told her life isn\u2019t as valuable as their lives so she needs to suck it up and deal with it. None of these things are ok.", "what attitude lol I am talking to my husband not her and why are her mistakes being held against me?", "I don\u2019t think she is holding  the stepdaughters mistakes against her. She is simply setting a boundary that she does not want to be a full time babysitter and it\u2019s unfair she was simply expected to do so.", "That's not fair at all.  No, you do not get a cheerleading squad because you're going to college like most other people in their teens and twenties.  The OP did not decide to have this child and the person who did decide to have the child has two parents.  \n\nWould it be nice if the OP could do the childcare?  Yes.  But she can't.  The only reason everyone thinks she can is that she has flexible hours.  What will happen will be that the OP ends up doing childcare and squeezing work in around it while the actual grandparents do zero.\n\nThe stepdaughter decided to have this child and she and the child's father need to figure out a solution that doesn't put the responsibility on someone who doesn't want it.", "I am not aware of the full details but he is either still 17 or just turned 18 but yeah he can't do anything atm he didn't even move with her. His parents aren't doing anything either,. I told my husband to contact them because all the arrows are pointing to him leaving her and starting a new life while his daughter remains a single mother. Idk did he contact him and his parents or not.", "?? i very much do not think that she should.", "I agree with you, but I do find OP's narrative about her stepdaughter very disappointing, particularly:\n\n\\>   my stepdaughter Juliet decided to have unprotected sex yet wants to live her life while I get to handle her problems so she would shine\n\nI may be reading or interpreting this wrong, but the overall impression I get from that one single sentence is that OP is low-key resentful of her stepdaughter. When you marry someone who has a child, you accept the circumstances, whatever they may be. You don't get to demonstrate a \"saviour\"-type complex toward your stepchild.\n\nAnother thing: Juliet was a teenager, just like we all were. We as strangers don't know the circumstances leading up to what Juliet had done, and I doubt OP even knows; hell, Juliet could have done EVERYTHING right, but still ended up pregnant! Birth control is not 100% fool-proof, despite how close to being fool-proof it has become. Anyone who enters this thread and tries to shame Juliet for doing what a good 80-90% of teenagers have done in their youth is a damned hypocrite.", ">\\>   my stepdaughter Juliet decided to have unprotected sex yet wants to live her life while I get to handle her problems so she would shine  \n>  \n>I may be reading or interpreting this wrong, but the overall impression I get from that one single sentence is that OP is low-key resentful of her stepdaughter.
