It's unfortunate that your mom raised her to be this way and didn't require her to take any responsibility, but that's not your or your siblings fault or burden bear.\n\nAnd it's not fair of her to take 100% of the only inheritance your mom left. You are all entitled to it. Anyone she's crying to can help her out if they care so much.", "NTA- having 2 kids by 19 was stupid. She needs to grow up, take her share and put it to good use.", "NTA - she got spoiled by your Mom, was allowed to be irresponsible, and now has to deal with the repercussions of your Mom's enabling. That is not your problem. Time she grew up. There are services she could reach out to for help, and her portion of the house sale will also be there for her. Also, sorry for the loss of your Mom.", "Classic example of \u201cpoor planning on your part doesn\u2019t constitute an emergency on my part\u201d She can use her cut for 1st and last month on an apartment, or, dare I say it?

Poor baby never learned to stand on her own two feet and unfortunately has only her self and mother to thank.  Entitled person isn\u2019t she?", "NTA.  She needs to grow up and start acting like an adult.  Personally I\u2019d get through getting the house sold and go low/ no contact with her.", "NTA, you did not make her homeless, she did that all by herself.", "NTA She is making herself homeless. Your mom didn't do her any favors by spoiling her and by not having a will.", "NTA and that would just motivate me to fast track the process from here on out.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your mother spoiled her and this is the result. She will be fine, she just has to be willing to start acting like an adult. She can start looking for places and use her share of the sale to cover moving costs and potentially even rent depending on how much you get. She should also start looking into getting a job (if she doesn\u2019t already have one) as she will need to be able to support herself and the babies, and daycare isn\u2019t cheap.", "Nta", "I don\u2019t really have a judgement, but I think you could have at least done a trial run of having her doing a rent-to-own situation.

Most kids that age haven\u2019t moved out, and if they have they\u2019re very rarely 100% self sufficient. Yea, maybe your mom babied her and neglected you but that\u2019s your mom\u2019s fault not hers. \n\nBut yea I mean I guess legally you\u2019re in the clear. I just kind of think there were steps along the way to at least try instead of taking the anger you feel about your mom out on Jenny", "Wow, I am shocked by all NTAs\ud83d\ude32 I think YTA, if you know that this girl is young and inexperienced, basically a teenager with two kids, and you KNOW she will go homeless and still carry on coldly doing what you are doing then YTA. You are legally ok, but morally, I am sorry, YTA. You are her relatives and maybe just a little bit of compassion will not kill you? You don\u2019t have to gift her this house, but you could\u2019ve let her stay for longer and help her a bit at least with advice and some wisdom, just you know, show some humanity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
