Shit hit the fan and I wanted some outside opinions about this...\n\nSo my BIL is a pastor at a pretty popular church in our city. Now both myself and my husband are not very religious people by any means. We both work in the medical field, he's a cardiologist and I'm a nurse so we've always had more scientific views on thing's. \n\nHis side of the family is very religious though, so we always keep our views to ourselves to be respectful, and go along with their religious thing's they do I guess (for example praying before eating)\n\nNow my BIL and SIL, one thing that they don't condone is cursing. Which I'm aware of and respect when they're around. \n\nMy husband and I recently bought a new house and my BIL and SIL have been bugging us to see it. We're pretty LC with them as they're pretty over the top with their religious views and shame us for not having the same views, but we thought why not so we can see our nieces and nephews.  This past weekend both my husband and I had off work so we planned a dinner with them and their kids. \n\nEveryone's at the table, SIL, my husband and I are in the kitchen bringing the food over. I'm pulling one of the dishes I made out of the oven I accidentally lose my grip and my hand hits the BURNING hot pan.\n\nMy first reaction is yelling \"OW SHIT!\"\n\nMy SIL gasps. Husband comes running over asking if I'm ok, and that I should've let him take that out. I grab some ice and head over to the table. \n\nBIL (who's sitting at the head of the table) is sitting there silently kind of shaking his head. \n\nNot even a \"you alright?\" or anything first thing he says to me is \"that cursing was very offensive to my family and I you know we don't condone that. Are you going to apologize to me?\"\n\nI'm kind of sitting there in shock for a moment when my husband comes to my defense and starts explaining to BIL it wasn't intentional, it was an in the moment reaction.\n\nHe starts going off about how that's unacceptable and a person of his \"rank\" doesn't condone or want to be in the presence of vial words like that.\n\nSo I say back to him \"I'm sorry BIL, maybe if you weren't acting so holier than thou and got up and helped us in the kitchen I wouldn't have cursed. And my hands fine btw thanks for asking\". \n\nThey leave shortly after dinner and ever since then my husbands side of the family had been bombarding us with texts about how we embarrassed BIL and SIL. Sending us quotes from the bible, articles about why cursing is \"unholy\" etc etc. \n\nHusband and I have honestly been getting a good laugh out of this, and think that everyone is overacting. I kind of feel bad though for my niece's and nephews, and feel like maybe I should've bitten my tongue but idk AITA?", "created_utc": 1677766885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g3ysk/aita_for_accidentally_cursing_in_front_of_my/", "score": 1530, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Also, there have been some studies that show that cursing actually helps people deal with physical pain. We cancer patients are fluent.)", "NTA\n\nTheir religious views mean that THEY don't get to curse, not that they can dictate how others live their lives. You've been very respectful of their views and for them feel so disrespected by the one time you slip up (IN YOUR OWN HOME!!) is ridiculous.", "NTA- this is not what being a Pastor is about. If he is scared of a little language use, how could he possibly be able to convert sinners that walk more dangerous roads. You should not be walking eggshells around this man, he should be treating you and your home with much more respect.. This is not good at all..", "NTA.

If BILs problem with swearing is this deep, he's more than welcome to leave. But he shouldn't dictate how you speak in your own home, especially after you got hurt.", "NTA\n\nHow he was acting is unacceptable. I want to know what bible verse they gave you because I can guarantee they're taking it out of context. They're not showing the love of Christ.

NTA. It was an involuntary reaction to hurting yourself you didn\u2019t curse AT them. And i guarantee as much as they would like to expunge curse words from their existence, they do exist, people will use them and they can\u2019t expect to live in some sanitized bubble. The audacity of being asked to apologize?! And without checking on your well-being? Nah fam. That wasn\u2019t very Christian like of your BIL. Your retort was PERFECT.", "First of all I read this as Pastor BILL not Pastor BIL and spent the first read wondering when this renowned preacher named Bill was going to show up to dinner with your SIL and BIL. lololol\n\nNTA. You hurt yourself and a curse slipped out. If your BIL is so delicate that he can't stand to hear a mild curse word when someone is injured without getting his drawers so twisted that he needs to cry to the ENTIRE FAMILY about it, he should stay home and stop interacting with the outside world. \n\nAlso being a \"man of God\" who couldn't even spare a moment to see if you were seriously hurt because his feelings were rankled... WWJD my dude?", "NTA its just the word shit which you said when your burnt your hand because the plate was hot as shit, he was more focused on the word shit than if you were okay, that's pretty shitty of him then he proceeded to act like hot shit talking about a person of his rank, he is full of shit.

Oh by all means please forwarx this shit to your BIL.shit", "FUCK THAT. NTA", "Lol, your bil is a moron. You are NTA for SO many reasons- 1)the cursing mentioned in the bible is taking the lord's name in vain, and I don't believe \"Shit\" is a nickname for Jesus, 2)the unmitigated gall of the man to demand an apology while in YOUR house for a one-word pain reaction 3) he's lucky you don't find a free-roaming pack of atheists to logic all over him.

I hope he doesn\u2019t go around pushing his lifestyle on others since he found it so offensive when you accidentally cursed in front of him.", "NTA and keep laughing. Your nieces & nephews are in for a rude awakening if they ever get to college, or if their dad actually allows them to live out in the world.\n\nAlso, it was incredibly disrespectful for your BIL to seat himself at the head of *your* table and demand you apologise to him in *your* house. He's a pastor, not Jesus, and even Jesus is portrayed sitting in the middle of his disciples, to show he was no more important than them.\n\nYour BIL is obviously on an obnoxious power trip.", "NTA.    He'd  never last in my house", "NTA, you're a grown adult and it's your house, you're more than entitled to swear in your own home, and it's not like you did it just to be offensive towards them.\n\nYour BIL and SIL are more than welcome to follow the no swearing rule for themselves, there's no issue with that, but trying to force that same rule onto other people (even when the swearing was clearly an accident) really isn't helpful, or realistic.", "NTA - You have tried to accommodate their beliefs and have shown them a great amount of respect, you only swore as a complete visceral reaction.\n\nI believe an actual good religious person would've helped you and, even if they don't like swearing would've still put your health and wellbeing above all.\n\nYou were right to call him out.", "NTA. I'm not aware of any Bible verses that actually forbid cursing-- they're all about not swearing *false oaths.* And saying \"shit\" is not swearing an oath to anything.\n\nFYI for the future, it's better to treat a burn by running it under cool water rather than using ice-- ice can damage the skin because it can get TOO cold.", "NTA. I would have waited until after dinner and politely asked them to:\n\nPlease get out of my fucking house and don\u2019t come back.", "Tell him you're sorry that satan has made his home in his heart, since he didn't ask if you were alright like Jesus would have.

Delicate ears can toughen up or catch up with you elsewhere.  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA, that's an outrageous response on so many levels!  Someone of his rank?  I'd want to vomit at that anyway but he's a local pastor not the bloody Pope!  Not checking to see if you're OK first, having the gall to actually try and scold you in your own home!  Fretting about swearing in front of young kids is understandable, you want to set a good example but objecting to someone's mild outburst in a moment of shock as they suffer an injury is breathtakingly out of touch.  Kids aren't actually stupid, you can easily explain that normally swearing isn't OK but it's entirely forgivable in such situations.", "As a Catholic/Christian I\u2019m very sorry he treated you that way. I hate to say it but speaking from personal experience, a lot of pastors in these popular churches tend to get an inflated ego as these people start worshipping them and not God. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the situation but he sounds extremely arrogant. It sounds like you are very accepting of them and try your best to accommodate them despite the fact that you don\u2019t agree with their beliefs. You are definitely NTA. I have cursed in the company of my grandparents on accident because something was thrown at me and I got very hurt. I screamed \u201cF\u201d and of course my grandmother scolded me harshly. It was an accident and I was very embarrassed. It\u2019s one thing if you said the f word every other sentence, totally other scenario to say \u201csh*t\u201d when you\u2019re obviously hurt. And even if you were cursing up a storm, it\u2019s your household, and adults are old enough to be able to handle profanity. If they don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t have to come to your home. I understand why you go LC with them and id honestly consider NC at this point. This is not the love of Christ as others have stated, and it seems like they won\u2019t be changing anytime soon.", "NTA. \n\n>\tfirst thing he says to me is \u201cthat cursing was very offensive to my family and I you know we don\u2019t condone that. Are you going to apologize to me?\u201d\n\nFuck no.", "NTA. Religious people are the worst.", "NTA. Fuck them", "NTA - your holier than thou BIL can go fuck himself. \n\nThe idea that you should be censoring yourself to cater to others in general is ridicules. But to also expect it in YOUR OWN HOME??? \n\nHell no!", "NTA - I would have told Bill to fuck off", "\"OW SHIT!\" is cursing?  \nWe live in very different worlds.", "NTA. Maybe a choice bible quote about what Jesus thought about the self-righteous would be in order as your response?", "NTA Even if the cursing was religious, which it wasn't.  And in your own home, too.\n\nYour BIL sounds like a bigoted and judgemental control freak.  I'm not surprised you don't have much interaction.  What an oppressive pain he must be.", "They sound quite unreasonable to be behaving that way in *your* home. NTA", "NTA Maybe one day he will slip off that high horse he's on.  Until then, keep up with the LC, they are not worth the energy you are wasting worrying about it.  People who act \"holier than thou\" like this typically have some really horrible skeletons in their closet, NOT ALWAYS, but a LOT of the time you find out later they've been doing some really crazy stuff behind closed doors.", "NTA. Saying 'shit' is hardly cursing. If that is all it takes to upset your BIL it is a good job he will never meet me or my wife.\n\nWhy on earth do you kowtow to their religiousness when they are at your house? Don't let them do the prayer etc.. and tell them that if they cannot respect your ways then that is insulting to you and your partner.\n\nBeing a pastor is not a 'rank' or anything like it. No religious person is better than you. If anything they should be kissing your feet for being a nurse because you really are important to the community. He is not.", "NTA, also outside people policing what you do or say in your own home because of their religious views? Straight up AH behaviour.", "NTA. Your response was right on par. He certainly didn't disapprove enough to not eat the free food you burned yourself on.", "NTA  \nYour BIL needs to learn how to be accepting of others, does he do that to folks in the wild? He was rude which is worse (IMHO) than cursing could ever be.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He wouldn't have sat on his behind, being shocked at your language and clutching the pearls.\n\n*So my BIL is a pastor at a pretty popular church in our city.His side of the family is very religious though, so we always keep our views to ourselves to be respectful, and go along with their religious thing's they do I guess (for example praying before eating)Now my BIL and SIL, one thing that they don't condone is cursing. Which I'm aware of and respect when they're around. My husband and I recently bought a new house and my BIL and SIL have been bugging us to see it. We're pretty LC with them as they're pretty over the top with their religious views and shame us for not having the same views, but we thought why not so we can see our nieces and nephews.*\n\nYay for respecting beliefs!\n\n*BIL (who's sitting at the head of the table) is sitting there silently kind of shaking his head.*\n\n*Not even a \"you alright?\" or anything first thing he says to me is \"that cursing was very offensive to my family and I you know we don't condone that. Are you going to apologize to me?\"  He starts going off about how that's unacceptable and a person of his \"rank\" doesn't condone or want to be in the presence of vial words like that.  ever since then my husbands side of the family had been bombarding us with texts about how we embarrassed BIL and SIL.

That 'honor' goes to your husband.\n\nHis rank is pastor, not glorified exalted one. He is to be a reflection of Jesus who often walked and talked with sinners. Does BIL think that 1st century fishermen,  tax collectors, regular folk didn't curse? I'm sure that Jesus heard some 'creative' language during His time on earth. And how does BIL interact with sinners who might use rough language when they come to him for aid- or do they not come to him because he has a stick up his bum?\n\nI think that you should send everyone who is texting you some verses from Matthew 23 where Jesus talks about the Pharisees.  The Pharisees put a great emphasis on outward appearances and actions so that they would appear righteous but were not concerned about being righteous in their hearts. Also in Matthew 6:5, Jesus tell us not to be like the hypocrites (Pharisees) when we pray  ( (paraphrasing- The hypocrites love to pray standing on the street corners to be seen by men). Your BIL sounds like he wants to be seen as a 'holy man' to others but is not truly one.
