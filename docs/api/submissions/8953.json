We have a large shared living room he lives in while I have a little bedroom upstairs. (Rent is divided accordingly) This morning at around 8:30 he told me had an interview in an hour and I would need to be quiet during it. I kinda scoffed and was like \"alright bro, I'll keep the tv upstairs off.\" He then got all serious and was like yeah man I heard you coughing during my last interview. I told him that he needed to throw in some airpods and sit at the desk downstairs, but if I needed to get a glass of water or cough or something that was gunna happen.\n\nHe got very upset saying I wasn't being considerate. I replied that I have also been taking zoom interviews, but I have been going to the starbucks literally a mile down the road as to not bother him. He seemed to think this was a ridiculous suggestion, but he did eventually leave to take his interview somewhere else.\n\nAm I the asshole for forcing my roommate to take a zoom interview at a coffee shop?\n\nSome context, he does have an office where he could have taken this interview but he's too worried about his boss finding out. (Which I think is kinda pathetic.) Also I work nights at the moment, so I was 1000% going to be home. I think with a little bit more heads up it wouldn't have been a big deal, but  I got stuff I have planned today as well and that requires me to be able to access the rest of the apartment to make breakfast, take a shower, do my yoga.\n\nEDIT:\n\nGuess I need to emphasize THERE IS NO PRIVACY IN THIS APARTMENT. THERE ARE NO WALLS OR DOORS BESIDES THE SHOWER. I have an upstairs area that is my bedroom, he has the entire downstairs. \n\nI agreed to turn off the tv, be quiet, do all those things, but I also have to shower/eat/do shit in my own home. I just said like damn if it needs to be silent he needs to go somewhere else. Like I'm entitled to use the kitchen off of the living area quietly. I can tiptoe around but the demand for silence was what was too far.
