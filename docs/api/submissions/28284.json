Your grandma is an idiot and your aunt is treating someone with down syndrome like they can't learn something as basic as covering their mouth, which is utterly insulting and is doing your cousin no favors.

You could have done it nicer but its been waved off. If she was so mentally crippled she cant cover her mouth, according to her mother, then she cant be trusted to hold a newborn. \n\nYour going to notice at your age when people just ignore or cater to their kids. When I was 15 we were at a family BBQ and I noticed a few of my cousins kids (3 and 5) getting dangerously close to a fast running river. I went and told my cousin who was like, \"They are fine! You dont have kids so you dont understand!\"\nCue 3 minutes later they both fall in and the 3 year old almost drowns. After they were pulled crying and wet but OK I looked at my cousin and said snottily, \"I told you so!\" I got yelled at by my mom on the drive home but seriously.", "NTA. People with Down syndrome are more than capable of learning manners. Coughing with your mouth open and onto other people is gross. She absolutely can help it but sadly her mother is not teaching her any better.", "NTA \n\nIf she cannot learn to cover her mouth when coughing, she never be holding any baby.", "NTA that is dangerous for a newborn and required immediate action.", "the 14 year old probably doesn\u2019t know any better since her mom hasn\u2019t been correcting her behavior. i do think the yelling and crying was probably another stressor for the newborn and his mother so in the future i would ask the mother how she would like the issue to be handled, this might be a case of picking your battles unfortunately. your grandma is obviously wrong that babies can\u2019t catch anything, RSV can kill babies whose immune system can\u2019t fight it", "ESH.  The cousin doesn't know any better and yelling at her for it was not called for.    Aunt and Grandma are way out of line and delusional to think this is okay.", "I\u2019m really curious to hear if anyone with Down Syndrome or anyone with family members with Down Syndrome has any opinions on this. \nI\u2019m Autistic and have several Autistic family members, and of course these are very different things, but from my knowledge it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to at least TRY to teach ANYONE to cover their mouth when they cough as long as they\u2019re physically capable of doing so. \n\nHOWEVER, I have noticed (just pattern recognition, I have no real data) that people with Down Syndrome seem to have more frequent respiratory issues and difficulty with mouth/throat/lips/tongue/swallowing mobility. I know that I have dyspraxia (likely due to the autism) that makes it more difficult for me to swallow properly. And I wonder if perhaps this mother and daughter are sensitive over her respiratory issues and coughing because it could be related to the Down Syndrome? And that may be why the mother got so incredibly sensitive over what seems to be a totally reasonable ask?\n\nEDIT: forgot verdict. NTA but more info needed", "So I just had a quick check-in with my mother, a special education teacher for the last 35 years. It turns out that people with Down Syndrome can indeed learn to cover their mouths. NTA and your aunt is just lazy", "I\u2019ve known plenty of people with Down syndrome. My grandmother was a paraprofessional in special education for forty years. She\u2019s taught them to cover their mouths while it is difficult. NTA.", "ESH. I get your frustration, and when parents don't bother to even try and correct their children it's incredibly frustrating. However, you could have spoken to her about it in another way in a different situation. You say she refuses to acknowledge it but you could have confronted her at another time more directly. It sounds to me like it was bubbling under the surface and this was an opportunity for you to lash out at her.", "ESH\n\nIt is up to the parents of the baby to decide who they are comfortable with holding their newborn. I'm assuming they had met you cousin plenty of times and had seen her cough before?\n\nObviously your aunt should be trying to teach your cousin things like covering your mouth when coughing, both for hygiene reasons but also to minimise the judgement she might face from others for doing 'rude' things like not covering her mouth. \n\nBut it is still not your place to enforce this. Neither one is your kid and it is up to the parents of both the baby and teenager to take responsibility for their kids. All you can do is set your own rules about your safety and behaviour, so you could say that you didn't want to sit next to your cousin because they might cough on you. That said most people would think that you were rude and it is generally considered polite to significantly bend your own preferences to accommodate people who have disabilities especially disabilities like down's syndrome which affect learning and development.", "And the mother of the newborn?  How did she react?", "ESH - I think your heart is in the right place but you shouldn't have yelled like that in front of the whole family, I would say you probably should have talked to the moms involved.", "your entire family besides you and that baby are morons.

Sometimes ya gotta pick up the slack of others.", "Ironic that your family is calling YOU \u201cignorant.\u201d Babies can\u2019t catch anything? What? Like what? You are NTA.

That's not an effective form of communication and it wasn't going to get them to listen, just upset them. Idk how old you are, but we should always strive for more healthy communication with people in our lives. \n\nNTA for being concerned and grossed out by your cousin open mouth coughing on everyone INCLUDING A NEWBORN. You're right that it's dangerous. \n\nYou should've said something a long time ago not in the form of yelling.", "EW. I would have lost it way before you did tbh, that\u2019s fuckin gross. NTA. We are not supposed to kiss newborns, leave alone coughing on their face. Does the newborn\u2019s mom also think you were wrong?", "NTA. If she doesn\u2019t know any better why would she be allowed to hold the newborn. That is some twisted ass logic. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the right time to do it but at the same time new moms don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking up so I\u2019m sure you made her feel better. I would apologize for the wrong time/wrong place but not for what was asked. She does need to learn basic manners. There are some people that don\u2019t have this capability and that is totally understandable, however she was holding the damn baby so she can certainly learn manners.", "YTA. I guess being mature was out of the question?", "NTA", "NTA this is frustrating to read at the best of times. People will learn if they're taught, and you keep up the teaching. This is a parent failing. It's even worse now we're still in a pandemic, which means nobody even tried to teach her to cough with her hand over her mouth or into a tissue during the height of an airborne pandemic.", "YTA. So much. \n\nThe 14-year-old with Down's Syndrome is not your child, and her mother was right there. If anyone should be correcting her, it's her mother. Also, in what world is it appropriate to yell at someone else's child, let alone someone with a disability? If there really was a redirection that needed to be made, it would be much more appropriate *and effective* to do it calmly and with kindness.\n\nThe baby is not your child. Your responsibility in keeping her from getting sick ends at you not being around her when you are sick. If she had a problem with her baby being held by your cousin, I'm sure she was well able to express that. Is there some reason you are aware of the cousin's coughing, but the baby's mother isn't? Your choice to react in the way you did not only embarrassed and alienated your cousin and her mother, but also undermined the authority of the baby's mother, and probably embarrassed her too.\n\nThere's a whole lot of hubris in thinking you know better than her mother what your cousin is capable of. Every person with Down's Syndrome is different, and just because some may be able to cover their coughs doesn't mean all of them can. For all you know, it's a tic or an unconscious reflex. She may not even be aware of it in advance or at all. But even if none of those are true, most people with Down's Syndrome are less capable of understanding typical social cues than most people who don't have Down's Syndrome; and less capable of regulating their emotional responses to aggression of the kind you showed.\n\nP.S. The baby's mother's silence on this is almost certainly not because she's grateful. If anything, she's as annoyed as everyone else because you've created major awkwardness whenever the baby and the 14-year- old are together. No one wants that kind of family dynamic.", "INFO- how old are you?", "NTA\nJust because a child has SN is no excuse to not even TRY to teach them manners that most of society expects.\nSigned, mom of a SN young adult.", "NTA- one it sounds like lazy parenting. And the mom is only reinforcing it by not saying or doing anything. My son is 3 and is autistic and does cough with his mouth open. BUT every time he does around others I quickly cover his mouth for him and explain that that\u2019s what we do when we cough. I know he doesn\u2019t exactly understand it now, but if I never teach him then he will never know.", "NTA. Your aunt is rude and isn\u2019t helping her daughter learn to navigate basic life skills.", "ESH. Your aunt seems ableist, and so do you. \nYou should have talked to your niece directly about this issue, not talk to her mom and then get angry over something your niece did that apparently she didn't even knew was bad, because you didn't think about talking to her like a human being. I can't imagine the distress she felt at the moment you and her mom started screaming.", "It's a tough one. I think you were probably too harsh, but not TA. Your emotions got the better of you, and you lashed out because you were concerned about your kid.\n\nI think an apology and explanation as to why you were upset would help. And the aunt might be underestimating her own kid's ability to learn. That happens a lot with parents that have a kid with a mental disability.\n\nSee if something can be worked out between y'all. Perhaps, if they can handle it, have them wear a mask when holding your kid, at least the kid is older and their immune system is stronger.\n\nBut, again, I don't think you were TA, just concerned and too harsh.", "NTA It's pretty insulting to say that someone with Down syndrome isn't even competent enough to cover her mouth when she coughs. And of she is too incompetent to cover her mouth when she coughs, what the hell is she doing holding a newborn?? (And your grandma sounds even less competent than someone who can't cover their mouth while coughing. Ffs)", "ESH.  It\u2019s not your kid, it\u2019s a special needs kid, don\u2019t yell at them. It would be really nice if the aunt would correct her daughter and she would learn not to cough like that. There may be a threshold of learning to where she really does not understand it\u2019s socially unacceptable and that it is not hygienic.\n\nThe aunt with the newborn knew the risk when she let her hold the baby, but that\u2019s a whole nother discussion about boundaries with letting people hold the newborn. If it was my newborn, the 14yo would not be holding him.\n\nUltimately, the 14yo isn\u2019t your kid and you can\u2019t change the way your aunt parents. Maybe there are other larger issues or behaviors they are working on.", "YTA I can't really think of any situation where you wouldn't be the asshole when screaming in anger at a child with Down syndrome.", "NTA. They are just making excuses and being lazy", "NTA!\n\nI grew up around kids with different disabilities and not one of them ever coughed without covering their mouths. \n\nI had a girl in my class with downsyndrome, and she even covered her mouth when she coughed.\n\nYour family does know that RSV is a VERY REAL thing that can kill the baby, right?  What about if the cousin gets Covid and coughs on the baby or an elderly person or someone with a compromised immune system?\n\n\nWill they still say, \"She doesn't know any better?\" Your aunt needs to teach this kid some manners because one day she is gonna cough on someone and make them sick, which these days is a criminal offense and she could be charges or the aunt could be charged instead of the cousin.", "Whole family sound stupid.

I promise you I was not yelling at her to be mean, I was scared for the baby. I see what I\u2019ve done wrong. Thank you.", "Found the aunt lol", "21", "SN? I haven\u2019t seen that acronym before.", "I explained in another comment that I\u2019ve tried teaching her myself but her mom tells me to stop saying I\u2019m \u201ccorrecting\u201d her.", "Yeah, thank you.", "Thank you for this point of view. I\u2019ll apologize.", "Literally. Like find a better way to communicate your concern. Yelling and making the kid cry obviously won't make them listen and learn", "She was pretty quiet during the whole encounter. I do think she was pushed into letting my cousin hold her and didn\u2019t want to upset anyone.", "> but sometimes keeping the peace is more important than being right\n\nMaybe it's more important than being \"right\", but it's not more important than protecting a newborn.", "Yelling at a girl with Down syndrome holding a newborn, who scares easily, is the definition of not being able to control ones behavior.", "I can't believe more people don't know this.  Diseases are actually caused by noxious miasmas and vapours, curses, an imbalance of the humours or demons.", "[what about this? out of curiosity](https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/diseases/infection_control.html)", "Oh that\u2019s horrible :(", "Not that this makes it any less wrong, but part of the reason that was \"believed\" for so long is that its *really* hard to give a baby anesthesia. \n\nI mean, its really hard doing it with a young healthy adult. Let alone a newborn baby.", "Dont. \nState your concerns. \n\"You say all the time how she doesnt know better but then why is she allowed to hold a newborn?\"\n\nYour going to see this behavior for a long time.", "If you apologize, apologize for how you said it, not for what you said. You\u2019re sorry that you frightened and upset your cousin. You\u2019re not sorry for pointing out that your cousin\u2019s disability is not an excuse not to teach her about basic hygiene things like covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze.", "Good. Do. Don\u2019t be cousin who screamed at the kid with Down syndrome.", "I wouldn't apologize. You need to stand firm that she needs to be taught to cover her mouth because it's important sanitarily and that she is likely perfectly capable of learning this... she has a disability that doesn't mean she can't learn these things.", "If she's capable of safely holding a newborn, she's physically able to lift her hand to cover her mouth, that's the thing.", "If this is the case -- and thank you for the information -- she shouldn't have been allowed to hold the baby.", "After Covid, coughing or sneezing on someone is now considered assault in some places", "Ask grandma if she remembers polio and the flu before regular childhood immunization...", "How old is your grandma though lol. Because unless she\u2019s like 85 or more and/or incoherent I can\u2019t see that being the excuse. To think babies can\u2019t catch anything is beyond just being old lol. We just got through a pandemic. My parents have scars from their smallpox vaccines, Spanish flu was something that effected a huge amount of the population, polio was another big one. This one just seems beyond simple ignorance - it\u2019d pretty much require you to ignore huge events to hold that belief.", "Good on you for recognizing that yelling scares babies. It's hard for me to see that you cared about the baby when you screamed. That may be why you're getting family pushback.", "Ah. Sounds to me like failed parenting. I feel bad for her because DS is not an excuse for parental neglect.", "As we grow up, we have to learn to control our reactions to our intense emotions, like terror. It can be hard, but it's worth the effort and practice. Your intentions were good but your impact was bad. You upset folks and you ultimately didn't teach your relative anything. It's a failure on their mother's part and it's not on you.", "We all have breaking points, yes, but when we break our actions are still our responsibility.", "I wouldn't make that assumption. Yelling in a baby's face spreads about as many germs as coughing. Assume that mom and dad can handle sticking up for their child in a more child-appropriate way.", "I have two kids and I would have freaked out in this situation. I'm surprised the mom didn't but I bet your interpretation is correct: she was glad you stuck up for her newborn but didn't want to deal with the drama.\n\nI don't get why this kid was even allowed to hold the newborn if she can't even cover her mouth when she coughs. Like - I imagine her dropping the baby or not supporting his neck and your aunt just being like \"she can't help it!\". OK - then she can't hold a baby.", "Find the idiot who thinks anyone not directly related to the situation could hold a different opinion to them.", "Too old to be yelling at a 14 year old child. Your concern was valid but yelling didn't solve or improve anything.", "I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s \u201cspecial needs\u201d", "I\u2019ll take the quiet to mean she wasn\u2019t impressed, either. NTA, but you should have let the mother do the mothering. Your Gran is way off-base. Hoping the baby doesn\u2019t come down sick. I assure you, a 14 y/o DS person is capable of learning, it just takes constant reminding.", "That\u2019s what the newborn\u2019s mother is for, isn\u2019t it?", "Actually, all disease can be linked to malnutrition or toxic overload.", "Let me know if I missed something, but all I see is a government website offering an explanation. According to the scientific method, that isn\u2019t a demonstration, and thus not \u201cproof\u201d by academic standards.", "I disagree on the apology front. I think apologizing for lashing out would make the aunt more receptive to recommendations and trying to find a solution that would work for both of them.\n\nSometimes, you gotta apologize even if you really didn't think you did anything wrong to smooth over rough patches.", "THIS! 100% you said it, stand by it! We\u2019re allowed to voice our concerns! I struggle with this, definitely gotta work on the delivery, but I mean every word I say!", "You don\u2019t know if relatives were standing nearby, monitoring, half holding the baby. You don\u2019t know.", "And as I said, I agree with you that yelling was inappropriate. But you said OP \u201cshould\u2019ve said something a long time ago not in the form of yelling.\u201d OP explained that they HAVE indeed done this and their aunt just says, \u201cshe can\u2019t help it.\u201d Yes, yelling is inappropriate, but coughing in a newborn\u2019s face is probably more inappropriate when the aunt has indeed been spoken to about how she needed to teach her daughter to cover her mouth when she talks. And then proceeds to allow said daughter, who \u201ccan\u2019t help it\u201d hold a newborn baby and then the daughter coughs straight onto newborn\u2019s face.", "That makes sense. I saw your other comment. I see why yelling was wrong.", "To be fair when younger children are allowed to hold a baby it\u2019s usually done more that they\u2019re propped up in the right position with pillows/an adult and the baby is laying on them. They\u2019re not usually in a position to drop the baby or actually be supporting it\u2019s neck alone.", "You're being unreasonable. Everyone snaps at times, especially when they are concerned about their children.\n\nHave you ever snapped from concern?\n\nI imagine you have. Please reflect on the standards you expect from people.", "I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t get that on my own. Thank you. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Right - and she wasn't doing her job, which is why OP was justified in stepping in. It seems like OP's entire family is clueless and needs OP to teach them basic stuff.", "And pissed off gods, certain star/planet alignmentss and witches.", "Agree. I'd apologize for the way it happened but not for actually saying something about it.", "She could apologize for her knee jerk reaction.", "Even if other relatives were helping her hold the baby, she still was able to lift her arms up for a time. Unless the relatives had lifted her arms for her and were completely holding them up while she saw the baby, she\u2019s demonstrated the physical ability to bring her arms up and hold them there long enough to cough for a few seconds.", "Right, I forgot about that part of the thing I wrote myself. Sorry, I'm tired.\n\nI think if OP had only yelled at the mom it'd be different, but he also yelled at a 14 year old kid.", " It's important to apologize after snapping at someone. Also OP isn't the parent of the baby, I'm pretty sure.", "You\u2019re not wrong. Downvote me again!!", "Ok", "Yes true. I feel bad for the girl. The aunt needs to get it together and stop acting like her daughter can\u2019t learn anything.", "You might be right on that second point. Still, concern for a child is a valid reason to be angry.\n\nAnd I've said elsewhere that they should apologize, but I don't think they are an asshole for it.", "Agreed! She's not doing her child any favors"]}
