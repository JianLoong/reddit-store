My dad didn't do any therapy.\n\n6 years ago I get a frantic call from my mom asking if I had slept with my then boyfriend on her couch. Apparently she found a wrapper and dad said it was mine. It wasn't, he paid for female company.  All was forgiven. Fast forward to 4 years ago. He gets arrested in a police prostitution sting. We borrow money from his sister to pay court fees. He gets off. We forgive and move on.\n\nIn the time since this incident I have 2 kids and he becomes involved. However over the past year he randomly disappears and lies about what he is doing. Mom thinks he has dementia and gets so worried she has a breakdown. Dad calls me to help her and does nothing.\n\nA month ago my son is staying over and his (edit to clarify this my dads) girlfriend calls triggering a huge fight between my parents which my son sees. Apparently for the past year dad has been again paying for female company and is now a crack addict. In retrospect I know he's been high around my kids. I am not willing to move past and forgive. \n\nThe conflict: I know me drawing this line in the sand will harm his recovery. I know that his family will guilt me and be furious. I don't believe he will recover and I'm sick of his lies. Would I be the assjole for putting my family and wellbeing first?

It would be doing them a wild disservice to send them around that danger and dysfunction.", "NTA. You have a responsibility to protect your children. If you chose to do that by refusing to allow your father around your children *ever* then that is your choice.  Your father has a history of being a whoremonger. a liar and a drug addict. Your mother is his enabler.  I\u2019m suspecting that you are cutting off not just your father but your mother and any relatives who can not be trusted to protect your children (if you are not present) to the same degree you want them protected.

Going low or no contact is purely acceptable.  I would have a tough time writing my own father off permanently but I would have no issue with leaving him on the outside until he were able to fully convince me that his troubles were in the past.
