No one deserves respect just because they have a parent label.", "You deserve love. I'm so proud of you! Internet mom hugs.", "This was also my question.  OP doesn't mention any illness or unusual infirmity.  \n\nIt just sounds like she's getting old, has regrets, and is using that to be manipulative.\n\n\nIt wouldn't matter either way for OP's course of action, he still shouldn't feel pressured to make up with his abuser.

I divorced my now X-husband when My younger daughter was 8. She was better off having a mom who respected herself than my older daughter who grew up seeing me being abused. It was really hard on the older one and her own self worth as a woman. They are 6 years apart but are best friends and live together happily. They both say how proud they are of me. Your mom is blessed to have you. Lots of healthy therapy.", "NTA. Your parents sound awful", "So, it's been over a month since i've talked to my father because he refuses to utter the words \"I'm sorry\"...the only words i am looking for to be willing to let go of what he did to be in his moment of explosive anger.

For reference - Im a 5'4, 130lb female, hes a 5'10, 230lb man. He didnt like that I told him if all he wanted to talk about was politics that Id have nothing to say, our views are different maybe because i didnt fry my brain with years of meth and i dont believe conspiracy theories.

Sure, you don't owe anybody anything.\n\nI would ask the question of what kind of relationship do you want with your mother in her last days?  Do you have enough affection for her to visit and be civil with the father?  Point being, even a partial reconciliation would likely mean a great deal to her.

Do what you need for your healing.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nI recommend reading r/raisedbynarcissists. Your family doesn't have to have a narcissist for you to read it. The sub has very obvious abusive family situations with terms and deep discussions that can apply to other situations.\n\nThe sub would call your Father the abusive one while your Mother would be an Enabler. An Enabler is the parent that lets the other parent abuse you without intervening.\n\nPeople's judgement can get skewed because being raised in an abusive environment makes them think that it's normal. Like, Dad just always yells so it becomes background noise.\n\nYour Father has created an environment where he gets what he wants or he rocks the boat to make everyone on it uncomfortable. It's like a toddler who tantrums when they're not told yes after asking for something ridiculous like touching the stove. Or, a bully who bullies a kid until they give in.\n\nYour family allows the environment when they give into your father. They're choosing to let him treat you like less than an equal human being. You're not a pet that needs to be commanded and trained into stopping a bad behavior.\n\nYou should never have to ask someone to treat you like a human being. Your family is consciously choosing to treat you as lesser. Your Father and they would've changed if you were worth it. Their actions show that they'll never change.\n\nThey're setting you on fire to keep themselves warm and they're showing that they don't care if you get burned.\n\nAs the sub I recommend shows, reconnecting with abusive family is always the wrong choice because your abusers never changed.
