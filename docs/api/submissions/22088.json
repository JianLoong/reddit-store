I think that's the real question. If yes then go back to what you were doing before. People die with regrets all the time. Guess your mom and dad can be added to the list. I'd reiterate that I'm showing the same respect I receive. NTA", "Your father abused you and your mother let him. To this day, she's defending him and enabling him. The things that happened to you happened because she let them happen.", "Nah, don't give in to her emotional blackmail. She enabled your abuse and is STILL enabling it.   \nYou stay gone, friend.", "NTA This is going to be kinda downvoted, But it needs to be an eye for an eye. Bully that man. Even if it's a phone call at 3am. Harass him. Trust me, you'll feel so much better. Your mother is an accomplice and doesn't deserve your love.", "NTA.\n\nYour PARENTS (both of them) decided to not have you in their lives when you turned 17. Why would you want to be involved with them now? Your mother is just as responsible as your father.", "NTA. Your mother stayed with your father to the detriment of her own child.  She may have had her reasons but now she gets to deal with the consequences. It is not on you to heal the family and congratulations on getting out of a rotten situation.", "NTA. Don't do it, you could lose all the emotional progress you have made.  Your mother doesn't actually deserve this kind of sacrifice from you, even on her death bed.  She was a terrible parent and she's once again putting you last.", "NTA. Where was your mother\u2019s willingness to put aside her feelings and protect her child from an abuser? Harsh at it sounds, it\u2019s a question worth turning back on her perhaps", "NTA, seems like you got it right the first go, ggod for you. Keep those people out of your Life.", "NTA. I don't know why people think they can command respect. Respect is EARNED not just given because you are the parent. I've gone no contact with not only my Father but also my in-laws. Best choice I ever made. I feel so much better because we don't stress over seeing them.Your \"father\" should be begging your forgiveness for being a AH actually.", "NTA. Fuck that abusive bullshit.", "Go no contact for sure. Live the peace you earned and deserve", "NTA. He doesn't deserve your respect.

The fucking audacity", "This one OP!!", "Hhmmm.  I find your advice intriguing.  I wouldn't down vote it, but maybe OP just isn't interested in wasting their incredibly valuable and precious time on 'dear' old dad.", "NTA- Forgiveness (if you ever get to a point where you can forgive your father) is a conclusion you have to come to on your own, it's not something your mother can force for her own peace of mind.

You have no obligation to do anything for a dying person. Even more so when the demand is having a certain emotion.", "Nta. \nYour mom is an enabler. Your dad the addict. \n\nWhen she asks for you to be the bigger person, tell her no mom. You and dad need to be the bigger ppl and stop rug sweeping your mistakes. Until he apologizes to me for kicking ME out at 17, you are gonna keep getting attitude.

You succeeded and left that environment Why are you back?!", "NTA - I presume they have no other children who are going to mind them in their old age?\n\nYour mother wants you to accept this 'forgiveness' but neither of you believe you did anything wrong.  You try to help them but he doesn't want it.  She wants to spend time with her child.\n\nMeet your mother at a neutral place - restaurant etc.", "Dying people who guilt are just as culpable as the one's that hurt you in the first place AND when you were young it was your Mom's job to protect you and she didn't.  She doesn't' get to manipulate you back into a toxic situation.\n\nNTA", "OP, at a certain point the gap between abuse victim and enabler is bridged. At that point all sympathy deserved to a victim is lost, because they've chosen to protect themselves by selling someone out. Your mother did that long ago. It was never on you to be a better, stronger, less vulnerable person than her, because you were her child, and yet she looked the other way when you were soft-disowned.\n\nThe fact that she takes part in his abuse now in framing you as the guilty party and wanting you to apologize to him says all that needs to be said. No matter how much of a victim she might be in her situation she is as much an abuser to you for enabling him as he is.\n\nNTA, because she doesn't get to lean on you with the, \"I'm getting old, do this for me,\" card when she wouldn't stand by or for you in all the years that you were under her and your father.", "Live in the peace you have earned and deserve", "NTA. He doesn't deserve your respect."]}
