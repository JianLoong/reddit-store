However 2 years into the relationship she told me that she was pregnant, being a freshman in high school it sounds horrific having a baby brother, I can\u2019t have girls or friends over without being questioned and told how weird it is, I told her \u201cOh that\u2019s great\u201d and waited 9 months for this baby to be born, after he was born things weren\u2019t awful, I mean it\u2019s kinda nice having a little brother. Unfortunately a medical miracle happened and my mom somehow got pregnant again only 10 months after giving birth and I was mortified. The second little bundle of grief was born and life sucked, it immediately felt like all the attention was gone. I understand that babies are high maintenance but at least a conversation would have been appreciated. Throughout high school things just got worse and worse, the screaming, the shit, the destruction and it never failed to make me miserable. What has pissed me off most is the fact that now one of my little brothers is old enough to open my door to my room and I hate it, my room is the one place in my tiny house where I can just have peace and privacy and now that\u2019s taken from me, so much stuff has been broken or almost broken because of them entering my room, and I constantly tell my mother that I don\u2019t want them in my room but she just repeats the same annoying bullshit that \u201cMy room is a privilege and that I need to spend time with my brothers\u201d but honestly I couldn\u2019t give a shit about them. I don\u2019t hate them nor resent them I just don\u2019t care for them, I\u2019m 16 and I have a ton of things I\u2019d rather be doing and hanging out with babies that I have no care for is not one of them. What\u2019s worse is how much my mother demands that I watch them and take care of their needs, these are not my kids and not my responsibility however I am constantly yelled at by her, my step father, and my biological father that I need to take care of them. Today was the final straw, I was just relaxing when they barged in,I told the, to get out but was met by a rotten scowl from my mother and she yelled at me to keep them in, immediately my switch was thrown of the floor, my desk was completely trashed, and my phone was being yanked out of my hands by my toddler brother, I was fed up and yelled at my mom to just leave because I don\u2019t have any desire to spend time with them and to stop forcing me to love them. She gave me another scowl and told me that I no longer get my allowance or my console because I\u2019m being cruel and heartless.

If possible, try to live with your father.\n\nAs someone who is significantly older than my siblings, I can tell you this likely won\u2019t get better. Many parents see their eldest child as a third adult/parent. It\u2019s exhausting and parts of your childhood will be taken away from you. Years will pass and no one will acknowledge what you gave up willingly or what was taken from you. You\u2019ll need therapy and that\u2019s okay.", "This is a tough one, but I'm going with an overarching NTA with a tiny bit of AH. To get it out of the way, AH because you are behaving like a spoilt child that suddenly isn't the center of attention because of the new babies who need much more attention because they're BABIES. Everything else, however, you're NTA but your parents are. At 16 you deserve privacy plus you need time, quiet, and space to do your homework and other school related activities. Your room is really the only place you are going to get that. Your parents unfortunately are only seeing the free babysitter that will let them have a break when it's actually their job to take care of the babies, not yours. They are parentifying you which is not good. Sadly I don't think your mom and stepdad will agree to a lock on your door, even if you make the valid argument that you need space and quiet to do your homework with no interruptions. I am going to recommend some things that are going to sound very unpleasant and hard, but may prove to be your only saving grace for the situation you are finding yourself in\n\n1.Pack up anything that has any value to you (electronics, keepsakes, etc.) that you don't want lost/damaged/destroyed/stolen/etc. Put them in a safe unused space (think overlooked corner of the basement type of thing). It may come down to buying a trunk or safe you can lock and keep everything in your room so long as it's out of the way and sort of \"out of sight, out of mind\" type thing. If you have to take anything out of it at any time, take it out only long enough to use it then promptly pack it away again.\n\n2. Get yourself a part time job. Organize it so that it fits around your school and extracurriculars schedule. Also start loading up on clubs/sports if you can. Anything to make you look really good to colleges in a couple of years time. If nothing else you can likely get a partial scholarship to help offset costs of living wherever you go. the bonus here is that it will keep you out of the house so that your parents can't use the \"free babysitter\" and will be forced to be the parents for the little ones.\n\n3. Once you have that part time job, start saving as much as you can. More immediately you may not feel like you are saving, because you should probably use some of your money to at least get yourself your own phone that you paid for. If you can get your own phone plan as well and still be able to be saving money, you might want to consider that too. Anything that your parents can hold over you with a \"we pay for xyz thing(s)\" you need to get on your own to take that power away from them. Start with crucial things like phones/phone plans or a cheap computer if you need one for school. After a bit of saving, if you feel you can splurge once without draining too much of your savings, then you can consider a gaming console or something, but the end goal is to save as much as you can for further down the line. Unfortunately you are still young enough that you will likely only be able to open a joint account for your savings. Find a trusted adult that you know will not try and take your money and give it to your mom or stepdad because \"you should be helping the household\" and use a bank that your parents aren't using to open the account so that they can't convince a \"friendly\" teller that they should have access (shouldn't happen but it does...)\n\n4. Locate your important documents. These are things like Social Security card, Birth Certificate, passport, transcripts, bank statements (for any account you may already have), etc. For now, simply be aware of where they are and how to get them. Normally it would be suggested that you get those under your sole control, but being only 16 your parents will probably still need them for things like enrolling you in school if you have to switch schools or other such things. When you turn 18 is when you can claim them and put them away with all your other safely stored items.\n\nI know that these are all things that are usually recommended for young adults trying to get out of a toxic family/household situation and you may not be in such a situation, but the fact that your own mother has no respect for your privacy, and all three of your parents (mom, dad, and stepdad) seem hellbent on making you take care of your half-siblings instead of hiring a babysitter if they need \"me\" time, I fear that such a situation is not far off for you. These next two  years are going to be rough on you, especially with some of the suggestions I made (mostly the securely storing your things) because it may feel like you have the most sterile, empty space and no place to really call your own, but you need to think a long game as well as a short game. If you do get that part time job and start buying your own things, SAVE EVERYTHING. Every receipt, pictures and handwritten serial numbers, descriptions of the items, the bills (if you get your own phone plan), the statements. EVERYTHING. Use your school's computer lab to scan them and the inventory of your items onto MULTIPLE memory keys (backups to backups to backups. Don't risk a key getting corrupted or lost.) The reason for all this is that if you get the things with your own money, your parents don't have the right to take them from you, but if things start getting worse for you they may try anyway. At that point you have the proof to recover the items. As harsh as it sounds, should they confiscate anything that is YOURS (you purchased with your own earnings), you may need to basically threaten them with going to the police regarding theft of your items. You would need to tell them that they have no right to take things you purchased on your own with your own earnings, and you have proof that the items ARE yours if they are not returned to you in a reasonable time frame. While that should be immediately, you might want to allow them a grace period of say 24 hours so as not to burn bridges too badly. Tell them you will allow those 24 hours (or whatever time limit you give) only, and the item needs to be returned to you in the state it was in when it was taken. Should there be damage, they need to repair that damage or replace the item if it's beyond repair as it happened in their care which makes them responsible. And tell them you have a record of the item, its model, its appearance and serial number so that they can't try to get a poorer quality product and pass it off as your item.", "NTA. You deserve a private space.", "Tell a counselor at school about what's going on at home. You're a kid, not a parent. You should get social services involved.", "NTA but even though you say you don\u2019t resent them, it sounds like you do. Maybe not deliberately, could be misplaced resentment for your mom/step dad. Babies/toddlers are hard and even harder during your teenage years and unfortunately you probably won\u2019t ever be very close with them because they are so much younger. Try to remember they are kids, it\u2019s not their fault and like someone else said, definitely get a lock.", "You\u2019re not the AH for needing a space you can lock and to keep your belongings safe. Little kids are destructive and it can be super frustrating. However, you should stop speaking so cruelly about your brothers. They didn\u2019t ask to be born and they didn\u2019t ask for you as a brother any more than you asked for toddlers in your space. Kids that age are wild and crazy and that\u2019s how they learn about the world. \n\nYou also have a great opportunity to help teach them how to be good humans. Show them empathy, patience, and kindness. Don\u2019t underestimate how much those boys will look up to you and look to you for guidance as they get older. \n\nI hope you and your mom can have a real conversation about how to meet your needs as an independent teenager.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being an AH about the room simply because everyone, especially at the age of 16, deserves a private space like a bedroom to feel safe in and to not have to worry about all of your belongings being knocked around and getting broken. Is there any way that you could get a safe or a lockbox to keep your electronics and valuables in for safe keeping? Could you lock your door or babyproof it so they can\u2019t get in? They make baby gates and door handle covers for this very reason. \n\nI also feel that it isn\u2019t fair that your mom and step dad parentify you by expecting you to frequently watch after your younger siblings. However, I saw that you get an allowance and if part of that arrangement is for you to help around the house and/or help with your siblings to earn the allowance, then you should be helping out. \n\nI do feel like you\u2019re being a bit of an AH about the negativity and hate towards your siblings that started before they were even born. Try to remember that they didn\u2019t ask to be born into this situation anymore than you did. They\u2019re also babies/toddlers, so they\u2019re going to do baby/toddler things. They can\u2019t help it. I also don\u2019t understand the comment about how you couldn\u2019t have girls or friends over without them thinking that it would be weird. Lots of people have younger infant/toddler siblings, even when they\u2019re in high school. It\u2019s not that odd. \n\nI also think that the yelling and arguing isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere with your parents. If you come at them screaming and hurling accusations, it will make them defensive and upset, which will only make things worse overall. I think what needs to happen is a calm but honest meeting between you and your parents about expectations and boundaries on both sides. If you think things will get out of control, invite a neutral party (like a grandparent, neighbor, family friend) to mediate. Work together to find a solution that works for everyone. Remember you may have to compromise on some things to get what you really want. If your parents refuse to meet with you, then make an appointment with your school guidance counselor or a pediatric therapist to enlist their help. \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH since everyone involved (other than the baby/toddler siblings) has been an AH in some way or another.", "NTA for wanting privacy and respect for your belongings, space, and time.\n\nYTA for blowing up at your mom.\n\nComing from someone who often has to swallow my pride and acknowledge that I didn't respond well to a situation.\n\nCalm and reason in an emotional situation is challenging to say the least, but apologizing for not handling the situation well can go along way in strengthening a relationship.", "NTA \n\nI am much older, but when I was 15 my stepmom had a boy, then two years later she had a girl. It was so annoying and I felt like all of my friends were getting attention and care from their parents, while I was forced to take care of the kids. They were constantly napping and I was being told to keep my voice down, or share all of my stuff with them. Everything in the house revolved around them and they got away with things that I\u2019d never been allowed.\n\nIt\u2019s normal to be resentful. I recommend talking to your mother during a calm moment and asking for some ground rules. Explain that you are a teenager and need some rules around privacy. But it\u2019s still going to be a pain. Keep in mind that the young ones are going look up to you and adore you. And if you choose to have a good relationship with them it will pay off.\n\nI\u2019m now a middle aged woman and I feel so grateful that I was able to get through the hard times because my younger brother and sister are my very closest family and I feel so lucky to have them in my life.", "Ooh going against the grain here, but I'm going to say YTA. I personally have much older and much younger siblings, oldest being mid 30s and youngest under 10. It's plenty of chaos and can be extremely annoying, but even if it's true telling your mom that you don't care about your brothers is harsh and an asshole thing to do. Girls at school telling you how strange it is, is really just because they're in a bubble of people, it's not weird and I know plenty of people with families like this. Kids are invasive and difficult to deal with when they are younger but you are almost an adult, who will have a decision whether or not you have a relationship with those kids when you eventually move out. You have less attention now and that's a difficult transition but it absolutely sounds like you are resenting your little brothers for existing. No you should not be an automatic babysitter, no your stuff should not be broken. See if you can get a lock for your room and place things that can be destroyed in safe places when you leave your room for the time being, Baby Proof what you can. You're not an asshole for being upset over these things, but these are babies trying to learn how the world works. I do think YTA specifically for announcing you don't care about them.", "YTA.\n\n>\tThe second little bundle of grief was born and life sucked, it immediately felt like all the attention was gone. I understand that babies are high maintenance but at least a conversation would have been appreciated.\n\nYou\u2019re angry that your parents aren\u2019t paying enough attention to you when you know they\u2019ve got an infant? Come on dude. I know it\u2019s frustrating but things will improve as your brother ages and maybe if you helped out a bit then they would have a moment of time and be able to have those conversations with you.\n\n>\tI can\u2019t have girls or friends over without being questioned and told how weird it is,\n\nIt\u2019s not really weird at all and your friends aren\u2019t very smart if they think it is. People have kids all the time and it\u2019s completely normal to have younger siblings, even with large age gaps.\n\n\n>\tWhat has pissed me off most is the fact that now one of my little brothers is old enough to open my door to my room and I hate it\n\nKids explore and that\u2019s what locks are for. Your brother just want to know more about you and your room so he goes in there. Many kids don\u2019t develop a sense of empathy than their much older than he is so it\u2019s very likely that he doesn\u2019t really understand how it makes you uncomfortable. So just get a lock and remind him gently that he\u2019s not allowed in there. Violent and angry outbursts could permanently scar him and hurt his development, so just be patient.\n\n\n>\tShe gave me another scowl and told me that I no longer get my allowance or my console because I\u2019m being cruel and heartless?\n\nYou usually get an allowance? Even after you don\u2019t help around the house with your new siblings or much else? Most kids don\u2019t get an allowance, even when they do chores or whatever else. And a console is a complete luxury. You\u2019re insanely lucky overall and you ARE being so selfish and rude. \n\nYou\u2019re at that weird age when hormones are raging and I understand that this is probably contributing to your emotional swings but you really must try to be more understanding and empathetic in this situation. Don\u2019t destroy your relationship with your parents or siblings out of frustration for what are temporary issues.\n\nAnd again, your needs for privacy are valid so you should insist that you are allowed a lock on your room. I hope it\u2019ll naturally lead to some de-escalation with a few of your other points of frustration. But please consider giving your folks a hand, I know you didn\u2019t ask for this and aren\u2019t technically obligated to help but a little goodwill goes a long way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
