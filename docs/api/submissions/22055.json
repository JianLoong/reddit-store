I turned eighteen four months ago and just graduated from highschool. I told my father I would no longer be attending family therapy. He said I have to go. I asked if he was going to kick me out if I don't go, and he said no. So I said I don't have to then.\n\nHe's mad, and my stepmother is furious. The reason I want to quit family therapy is that for the last three years I've listened to the therapist tell me to compromise with someone that never compromises with me, to respect someone who never respects me and that my feelings aren't valid. So, I'm done. My stepmother says \"we've made so much progress,\" which is a lie.\n\nI missed our Monday afternoon session, as I said I would. My stepmother told me I wasn't welcome to eat dinner with them, and I said that was fine. At dinnertime my father came to my room and told me to come to dinner, and I said I wouldn't because I wasn't welcome. He said I won't be treated as an adult if I act like a child. Tuesday my stepmother said I couldn't use \"my\" car that I pay the insurance on and gas for. I said fine. When she wanted me to pick my siblings up from school, I said I had no car. She insisted I do it, but I refused. She had to drive, which she hates doing.\n\nMy dad says I'm being a jackass and throwing a temper tantrum over \"teen angst bullshit.\" I disagree. They don't have to let me use the car (although I will stop making the insurance payment if I'm not allowed to use it) and they don't have to feed me, but I don't have to let them use food and cars to control my actions. He said \"this bullshit is why we need therapy.\" That's dumb as hell, because we went for three years and here we are.\n\nThe only thing I feel bad about is my siblings, who don't understand why everyone is angry and thought I was mad at them because I wouldn't pick them up from school. My stepsister asked me to just come to therapy with them next month, and I hate telling her no, but I refused.

Make sure your family don't have access to bank, credit, etc.\n\nConsider getting a PO box for your mail.  Use informed delivery if it's available in your area(USA).  You can see when you get mail, so you don't have to check it every day(you can do this even if you don't get po box--so you know to look for stuff at home.).\n\nIf you are paying some bills already(car insurance), I'm presuming you have a job.  Look into buying your own car(cheap but functional).  You can love your siblings and even Love your Dad, but you don't have to live where you aren't treated with basic human respect(even abused at least emotionally).\n\nAlso assess who can help you achieve independence.
