I turned eighteen four months ago and just graduated from highschool. I told my father I would no longer be attending family therapy. He said I have to go. I asked if he was going to kick me out if I don't go, and he said no. So I said I don't have to then.\n\nHe's mad, and my stepmother is furious. The reason I want to quit family therapy is that for the last three years I've listened to the therapist tell me to compromise with someone that never compromises with me, to respect someone who never respects me and that my feelings aren't valid. So, I'm done. My stepmother says \"we've made so much progress,\" which is a lie.\n\nI missed our Monday afternoon session, as I said I would. My stepmother told me I wasn't welcome to eat dinner with them, and I said that was fine. At dinnertime my father came to my room and told me to come to dinner, and I said I wouldn't because I wasn't welcome. He said I won't be treated as an adult if I act like a child. Tuesday my stepmother said I couldn't use \"my\" car that I pay the insurance on and gas for. I said fine. When she wanted me to pick my siblings up from school, I said I had no car. She insisted I do it, but I refused. She had to drive, which she hates doing.\n\nMy dad says I'm being a jackass and throwing a temper tantrum over \"teen angst bullshit.\" I disagree. They don't have to let me use the car (although I will stop making the insurance payment if I'm not allowed to use it) and they don't have to feed me, but I don't have to let them use food and cars to control my actions. He said \"this bullshit is why we need therapy.\" That's dumb as hell, because we went for three years and here we are.\n\nThe only thing I feel bad about is my siblings, who don't understand why everyone is angry and thought I was mad at them because I wouldn't pick them up from school. My stepsister asked me to just come to therapy with them next month, and I hate telling her no, but I refused.

Let your dad know your actions are a direct result of her demands.

Though I think you should go to one more therapy session and explain all of this right to the therapist if you haven't already. Your parents have a bunch of the red flags for narcissistic personalities so there's no arguing with them. They live in their own reality and need to control it to the nth degree.

You were told not to come to dinner & then dad says come to dinner.  You can't have parents telling you 2 different things.  That's a huge problem right there.  They both need to agree on things.

You're all of 18, and now you believe you are an adult and want to be treated like one. For your first major decision, you decide to simply stop going to therapy because for the last 3 years you have already been ignoring the professional who has been trying to point out that you are in the wrong and need to change, which means there is no point in you even going in the first place.\n\nAll of this makes perfect sense to me.\n\nBut now, because you pay for insurance and make the occasional grocery run, you think you are somehow independent and are entitled to be treated as such.\n\nTell you what, move out. Pay for rent and utilities. Buy a car, don't just pay the small increase in premium that comes with being added to another drivers' insurance policy. Buy all of your own food, and go get it yourself in the car you bought. Develop relationships with people who aren't related to you, and will just drop you rather than put years of effort into trying to be close to you.\n\nI know I have a sarcastic tone here, but I truly think this would be good for you.

Adults make plans, ahead of time, to deal with the potential consequences of their actions.

There are good therapists and bad therapists just like all else and a lot of it comes down to their style of therapy and how they practice.
