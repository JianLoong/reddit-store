Let her figure out another plan.", "NTA.\n\nNot your kids, not your responsibility.", "NTA, your time, use it how you want. This person sounds like they will be very willing to exploit you, so keep some distance, no need to inherent her stress and hectic scheduling. \n\nBut info: did she offer *any* kind of compensation for your time? and whats an IEP?", "NTA. Do yourself a big favor and say no right off the bat. You don't have to explain why, just say that it simply won't be possible.", "NTA. Just say no. No, that doesn't work for me. No, I cannot. No. No. No.", "NTA-sorry I can\u2019t make that commitment.", "In my state this is actually illegal.  You could check with the school on that.

NTA. Run in the other direction!! That is a HUGE ask!!", "NTA. She asked and you are perfectly fine saying no. Don't give excuses or reasons that she can then try to argue around.

Not your kids and definitely you are under no obligation to do anything for her.", "I wouldn't do it because things happen and once you start helping her with her kid, you're gonna wind up watching those kids all the time", "No, of course not. Their kids aren't your responsibility; but if you agreed to this, they could very well become a liability. Don't do it.", "I have three kids. Do not agree to this.

It's great- gonna store this in my phone for future use!", "And see that's another concern of mine. I am habitually early because I like to have a moment to decompress and get myself ready to start the day.

She has a mutual coworker trying to guilt me into it.\n\nAn IEP is an individual educational plan. Is it state bound contract between the school district, the teachers, the parents and the student that it pertains to.

They are not even remotely your responsibility.", "I get to school early because it\u2019s the only time I can focus on my planning without interruptions.

It is absurd,  even if kids were not needy.\n\nEven with angelic kids, this means that you would be required to go home every day after work whereas normal adults are free to do whatever - shopping, gym, hike, visit friend, just take the drive.\n\nThis also means you are not allowed to leave on your own terms every morning, can not come sooner to work, can not shop before work, can not go to doctor in the morning,  can not take a day off, can not sleep longer if your day starts later for some reason.

That's all you have to say on the subject.
