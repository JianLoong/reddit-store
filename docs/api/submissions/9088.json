I am so sorry for your loss. I still cry about losing my cat that I was closest to last year and am doing so even now when I am typing this.  He slept beside me and followed me everywhere. This is perfectly normal to grieve for the loss of your pet. I have a son and we both still cry for him. Pets are very special family members, who are like toddlers that have to be cared for and give us so much love and are such a huge part of our lives. We hang Christmas stockings for them and they know which one is theirs,  wrap them presents under the tree, fill Easter eggs with cat treats and toys that they get to attack Easter morning, and they get excited like little kids in anticipation to do all these things and enjoy every part of it. Every time we go to the store, they go through our grocery bags looking to see if we brought something for them. They are like little kids and are emotional in the same way.  \n\n\n Unfortunately,  it is difficult for those who don't have that relationship with animals to understand exactly how much love we share with them and the terrible grief we endure from the loss of our pets. Please know you are not alone, and you are perfectly normal to grieve your cat you loved very much.  I am sorry your family isn't very empathetic and understanding . You need a better support system, if you don't have friends you can discuss these things with, hopefully you can find the support you need to work through your terrible loss online, as you care far from being alone in considering your cat a family member and loved one.", "NTA  \n\nYou sister is one.  \n\nYou're allowed to cry, moan, wail, and sob for your cat.

You have every right to grieve the loss of your cat. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as losing a child\u201d well your cat was your child and you lost it, so you DID lose a child. You deserve understanding people who support you. I am so sorry they did this to you and diminished the sorrow you feel by criticizing instead of supporting.

I\u2019m sorry for your loss. And while your cat can never be replaced it\u2019s still a good thing that you have the other one to help you through your grief. \n\nTechnically, sure, having to bury your child is known to be one of the hardest losses anyone can suffer. But no child was killed, you were grieving a beloved pet, you weren\u2019t belittling anyone else\u2019s actual experience. There really was no need to belittle your grief. Your sister is an insensitive AH and your cousin and mother are AHs as well although obviously I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re as insensitive or simply have been fed lies by your sister. Wouldn\u2019t excuse them, just earn them a different AH badge.", "WTF?! NTA F*ck that. I've lost a child. That pain was unbearable. Last week I lost my 18-year-old cat I got a month after my daughter died. That pain was also unbearable. I've never compared the two and never will. Grief is grief. My cat was my heart and filled so many spaces in my life. Our pets become family and their loss is painful. 4 months ago my 18 yr old cat died and I cried for days. When my 19 yr old cat crosses the rainbow bridge I'll probably be inconsolable. Shame on your sister and anyone else who minimizes your grief!!\n\nI'm so so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, but your sister is.\n\nI hate it when people play the Pain Olympics. \n\nYou suffered a loss and instead of show an ounce of compassion, your sister totally invalidated your grief.", "NTA. Your sister sucks.\n\nI'm very sorry about your kitty, meet up with the little furball at the rainbow bridge. I'm crying for your loss.", "NTA. Not sure why your family are so mean and messed up. I think you would feel better if you disconnected for a few months. It's rotten to discount someone's grief. I just don't understand their behavior. At all. \n\nGlad you have your other kittie for support. It's hard when your first one crosses the \ud83c\udf08 rainbow bridge \ud83c\udf09.", "NTA. I cried when my neighbor told me their cat had died.", "\"Grief is not a competition.\"\n\nTHIS! For a while after I lost my mom, people would be afraid to tell me they lost a dog or uncle or something, because how dare they feel pain while I am. Pets can be children and best friends. The uncle could've raised them. And even if not, that was never a game I wanted to win. \n\nNTA. I'm so sorry for the loss of your loved child.", "NTA, they should be ashamed for invalidating your feelings completely unprovoked. You didn't even mention children, they might be projecting their prejudice of you being childless onto you. I'm so sorry for your loss, even compared to losing a human loved one, losing an animal companion is devastating", "Family members are TA grieve and avoid them meanwhile", "I lost my cat a few years ago. Had her for 12 years, and she was my snuggle bug. I was devastated even with 2 other cats. NTA", "NTA - grief has nothing to do with who you lost and everything to do with the fact that you loved and lost. Judging other people\u2019s grief is disgusting and what\u2019s worse is she didn\u2019t even acknowledge your loss, just dismissed you outright. I lost my bunny to GI Stasis 6.5 years ago and it was the hardest thing I have gone through because I loved him so much. I have 2 cats now and am very attached to one. If she died I would be devastated. I also have a child I love and obviously would be devastated if something happened to her too. We grieve because we love and sharing love with the world is always a beautiful thing. I am so sorry for your loss. Cry as much as you need to and be gentle with yourself. Ignore your sister, she is heartless and cruel.", "I have a different 'take' on this. If the interaction with your sister went as you described, OP, NTA. Your sister was TA for not responding to your grief appropriately. However, if you first said to her \"it's like losing a child\" then Y W B T A from my perspective. I have lost a child and am highly offended when people lose a pet say \"it's like losing a child\". This is not a case of me trying to win a \"competition\" with others in grief. I believe that the only people who should ever utter that phrase are people who have lost both a child and a pet. If you have only lost one, you can't really say what the other is like. I have pets and love them dearly. I completely validate your feelings of grief and do not believe that your sister should have minimized them. She should have comforted and supported you. OK, I will hop off of my soapbox now and 'peace out' with a sincere statement: I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA first off I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Second your sister needs a reality check. I have 4 cats and a kid due next month. We joke that the cats are going to be the spoiled ones while the kid has to wait in line. It\u2019s ok to love your cats and treat them like your babies. It\u2019s not ok for her to think she can steamroll you for being human. Block their numbers, take a break, take some time to heal and then see if you still wanna talk to them.", "NTA. Just the thought of losing the cat I've had almost 8 years is enough to bring tears to my eyes, so I can't even imagine actually losing a cat and just brushing it off.", "NTA\n \nHow empty must their lives be that they think it's important to shame someone for being sad in their own home.\n \nBe thankful you don't have to live like them.", "NTA Sounds like your family\u2019s uncomfortable with expressing feelings.  They\u2019re not going to be able to comfort you about losing your cat so you\u2019ll have to rely on friends for understanding about that.  Take as much time and as many tears as you need. Your sister\u2019s wrong:  Losing a pet can be exactly like losing a family member.  Sorry for your loss.", "NTA at all! Sure pets may not be HUMAN babies but they can still be our babies. I lost one of my girls at almost 11 years old last march and I still have days where I cry because I miss her. I raised her since she was born along with her 2 other sisters and it was devastating to lose her.", "NTA. Your family sucks. Are they always this awful? I\u2019m wondering why you even need confirmation on the fact that you are NTA.\nPet deaths can often be the worst ones to go through.", "I held my 22 year old cat as she was euthanized (she was dying). I took the day off of work, and I cried until bedtime. I'm still feeling the effects. \n\nNTA. Your family is mean.", "NTA. You need to cut off contact with your family.", "NTA\n\nI lost my 17 year old tuxedo girl 2 years ago, she was my furry child and it was devastating. Do not allow anyone to dismiss your grief, she was your family, whether you gave birth to her or not.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss", "NTA!! Losing a beloved pet who is part of your life is devastating. Your sister is AH for trying to minimize your grief.  Your cat was there for you in so many ways, of course you feel grief.", "NTA - this isn't a contest, what's wrong with them? I lost my cat two years ago, she was my first baby, she was with me when I was going through infertility. She was my everything. She passed away at the age of 12, 3 weeks after her diagnosis. I still cry for her and I can't imagine the day I won't miss her. It's ok to cry and mourn, there's no timeline for mourning. All I can say is it does get easier, and eventually you'll be able to look back and be happy for the time you had with them. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA and you have a terrible family. I have three 12 year old cats, and I've cried just thinking about them dying someday. I will be absolutely devastated & heartbroken, and my husband even moreso. Let yourself grieve- losing a pet who you spend so much time with is a very real loss. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. So sorry for your loss. Losing a pet is one of the hardest things that anyone can go through. There is no comparison between kids and pets. They are each different and unique relationships. Losing your cat after 12 years is devastating and you deserve to grieve in whatever manner you choose. Ignore your family, I hope you have others in your life who can support you through this difficult time", "NTA.  Your sister need to stfu.  Grieve is grieve, whether it\u2019s for a person or a pet.", "NTA!! Sorry for your loss. Those tears are your memories.", "No one gets to tell you what something means to you, especially not a living thing like a pet. I grew up with a cat for the first 15 years of my life and I still miss him. He was like my brother, he\u2019s in every childhood photo, he was always with me. If you say that to people they act like it\u2019s weird, but I think loving something - even of another species - that much is a wonderful quality in a person. \n\nYour family are being very narrow-minded, and completely disrespecting what your cat meant to you, thinking only of what a cat might mean to them. Ignore them, maybe don\u2019t have them over for a while, just focus on taking care of you. NTA.", "I had a cat who was ill who decided it was time to go the day that my extended in-laws, about 12 of us, had tickets to a Broadway show. I canceled so I could take her to the vet and she wouldn\u2019t be alone. It\u2019s been a decade and the assholes still hold it against me. I don\u2019t spend as much time with them as I used to.", "THIS!\n\nI got a tattoo in memory of my girl, Nova, I cried as the artist was doing it.

Mom's known loss before, she's lost both parents and four siblings.  She still cried when the cat died.", "That's still a terrible reaction that's very unlikely to be comforting at all.
