Folks shouldn't be telling you how to feel or minimizing how difficult the loss is.", "WTF is even going on here? \n\nOf course you are NTA for being sad about your cat. Our pets are part of our lives and families. I never have equated them to children, but many do. But the loss can be extreme and just as bad as losing a member of the family. \n\nAnd who was the one to equate it to losing a child? Sounds like it was your sister who said it. And why? Because you were sad and she couldn\u2019t relate? \n\nYour sister is certainly an asshole for not allowing you to grieve and making you question your grief. And your family is being unsympathetic and callous.", "NTA I\u2019m so so sorry for your loss. Pets are family. You\u2019re allowed to feel however you feel.

WTF?????\nway to make it about herself\u2026.. i wonder if she told your family members that you actually said that this  was on par with losing a child, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re blowing up your phone. \nthen again, people are just assholes sometimes, so maybe that\u2019s just wishful thinking", "NTA but they totally are! I'm so sorry for your loss. If I lost one of my fur babies I'd be in shambles too, they do really become like your kids after caring for them for so long. \ud83e\udec2\ud83d\udc99", "NTA losing a pet is devastating for some of us. I still get teary eyed thinking about pets who have been gone over 20 years. \n\nGrief is always worst when you lose someone who you are with every day. That's why I honestly grieved harder when I lost my dog than when I had lost my grandmother earlier the same year. I loved them both fiercely but I saw my grandmother every couple of weeks and my dog all day long so I was constantly reminded that my dog was gone which made the pain raw a lot of the time. \n\nI'm so sorry that you have to be without your cat now. Look after yourself and try to block those members of your family who can't keep their heartless opinions to themselves out for the time being. You don't need that toxic competitive grief garbage in your life.", "NTA\n\nNot sure why the least intelligent of our species always feel the need to compare grief.\n\nLiterally anything someone is grieving about, some idiot will say \"It's not as bad as... (insert literally anything else)\"\n\nGrief doesn't work like that. Your family are AHs.\n\nI'm so sorry you lost a member of your family. I know you're hurting. Don't forget your other cat is likely to be grieving too! Animals do, even if we don't recognize it all the time. I hope you can be a comfort to each other.", "NTA.  Sorry for your loss.\n\nGrief isn\u2019t a competition sport.  You cared deeply for your cat.  You are grieving.  Don\u2019t let anyone tell you how you should feel.\n\nNow, to the specific comment.  If one of your nieces or nephews died, would it ever occur you to say, well you still have the other two?  If her spouse died, would it ever occur to you to say, it isn\u2019t as bad as losing a kid?  I suspect the answer is no.\n\nWhy?  Because the comments would be cruel and asinine.", "Oh my gosh OP, I'm so sorry. My heart hurts so much for you.\n\nPets are family. They are 100% dependant on you, you are their entire life, and they are totally your family.\n\nI have a kid and pets. I've had a stillbirth and 3 miscarriages, and I'll tell you something. Losing someone you love hurts. Human or animal, it all hurts, and you deserve to grieve.\n\nNTA\n\nYour family sucks though, I know you know this.\n\nYou don't deserve to feel guilty over feeling grief.", "I'm so sorry for your loss! :( I lost my 15 year old cat a few months ago and I was devastated. Some of my family members were incredibly sympathetic and validated my grief, while others said the absolute dumbest things. Your sister (and mom and cousin) are saying dumb things because they're thinking about how they would feel instead of thinking about how you are feeling. You are entitled to grieve the loss of a wonderful part of your life, it is normal and it is natural. It's also OK to take some time away from people who are not supportive, even if they are family, so you can grieve properly. NTA.", "NTA. WTF is wrong with them?? Your rightfully sad you lost a beloved pet. Randomly comparing it to losing a kid isn\u2019t the point. You didn\u2019t start by saying it\u2019s the same thing.", "You are not the asshole.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. I still cry about losing my cat that I was closest to last year and am doing so even now when I am typing this.  He slept beside me and followed me everywhere. This is perfectly normal to grieve for the loss of your pet. I have a son and we both still cry for him. Pets are very special family members, who are like toddlers that have to be cared for and give us so much love and are such a huge part of our lives. We hang Christmas stockings for them and they know which one is theirs,  wrap them presents under the tree, fill Easter eggs with cat treats and toys that they get to attack Easter morning, and they get excited like little kids in anticipation to do all these things and enjoy every part of it. Every time we go to the store, they go through our grocery bags looking to see if we brought something for them. They are like little kids and are emotional in the same way.  \n\n\n Unfortunately,  it is difficult for those who don't have that relationship with animals to understand exactly how much love we share with them and the terrible grief we endure from the loss of our pets. Please know you are not alone, and you are perfectly normal to grieve your cat you loved very much.  I am sorry your family isn't very empathetic and understanding . You need a better support system, if you don't have friends you can discuss these things with, hopefully you can find the support you need to work through your terrible loss online, as you care far from being alone in considering your cat a family member and loved one.", "NTA  \n\nYou sister is one.  \n\nYou're allowed to cry, moan, wail, and sob for your cat.   You can scream.  \n\nJust because pets aren't human does not mean that the humans who care for them don't deserve to mourn their loss as much as they need or want to.  \n\nYour sister is unempathetic.", "There\u2019s a wonderful book, [PS, I Love You More Than Tuna](https://www.morethantuna.com/resources/), that helped me through the loss of my beloved cat. \n\nYou can buy it via the Tuna website. There\u2019s also a forum, a blog, and other resources. I can\u2019t recommend it enough. \n\nPS: I\u2019m so sorry about your kitty. NTA", "NTA\u2026 but your family is freaking horrid. First I want to say, I am so sorry for your loss. It is hard and painful to lose a family member no matter what specie it is. Whether it is a human, a cat, a dog etc doesn\u2019t matter, love transcends anything physical and connects us all. You have every right to grieve the loss of your cat. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as losing a child\u201d well your cat was your child and you lost it, so you DID lose a child. You deserve understanding people who support you. I am so sorry they did this to you and diminished the sorrow you feel by criticizing instead of supporting. Just remember you are allowed to feel sad and grieve as strongly as you wish. Honor your cat\u2019s life and passing by properly grieving them, don\u2019t let your family take that away from you.", "No, you're NTA and just block them for a while. I don't get what is so important that it's worth bombarding someone with texts but it seems to be very common on this sub.\n\nI'm sorry you lost your cat. I know how close it's possible to get with a pet. It isn't as bad as losing a child, in fact nothing near, but you never claimed it was. It's hardly comforting someone who's grieving to dismiss their feelings like that.\n\nAfter my ginger cat died unexpectedly, I was a wreck. My dad had died only months before and I was in a state of uncontrolled grief. NOBODY told me my feelings weren't valid. So, OP, your feelings are valid, your grief is valid, and hug your other kitty for us both.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it is still a major loss. You loved, cared for your cat and s/he was big part of your life.\n\nI am sorry your sister doesn't have an empathetic bone in her body. Also make sure your mother knows those were your sister's words not your's.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nYour family sound cruel! The fact that they compare you losing your cat to losing a child is completely unnecessary and inappropriate. \n\nYour grief is valid! Your cat was your baby!

Daughter had his ashes in a locket. Her dad, my husband, died on her 15th birthday she also has some of his ashes in a locket. Someone asked her once why she wore them both because he was just a dog. She told him that Koda was her first best friend, her brother (she is an only child) her partner in crime, her confidant. Her dad was her hero, her support, gaming partner, her biggest fan.

It doesn't matter that you lost a pet and not a child, you're sad and in pain and that's all they should be focused.
