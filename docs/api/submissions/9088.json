I am so sorry for your loss. I still cry about losing my cat that I was closest to last year and am doing so even now when I am typing this.  He slept beside me and followed me everywhere. This is perfectly normal to grieve for the loss of your pet. I have a son and we both still cry for him. Pets are very special family members, who are like toddlers that have to be cared for and give us so much love and are such a huge part of our lives. We hang Christmas stockings for them and they know which one is theirs,  wrap them presents under the tree, fill Easter eggs with cat treats and toys that they get to attack Easter morning, and they get excited like little kids in anticipation to do all these things and enjoy every part of it. Every time we go to the store, they go through our grocery bags looking to see if we brought something for them. They are like little kids and are emotional in the same way.  \n\n\n Unfortunately,  it is difficult for those who don't have that relationship with animals to understand exactly how much love we share with them and the terrible grief we endure from the loss of our pets. Please know you are not alone, and you are perfectly normal to grieve your cat you loved very much.  I am sorry your family isn't very empathetic and understanding . You need a better support system, if you don't have friends you can discuss these things with, hopefully you can find the support you need to work through your terrible loss online, as you care far from being alone in considering your cat a family member and loved one.", "NTA  \n\nYou sister is one.  \n\nYou're allowed to cry, moan, wail, and sob for your cat.

You have every right to grieve the loss of your cat. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as losing a child\u201d well your cat was your child and you lost it, so you DID lose a child. You deserve understanding people who support you. I am so sorry they did this to you and diminished the sorrow you feel by criticizing instead of supporting.

I still cry over losing my 16 year old cat in Dec. 2021. RIP to your kitty. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA yes losing a pet isn't the same a child, BUT THEY ARE STILL FAMILY. I have lost so many pets over my life due to old age and stupid drivers, and each time no matter how long or short we had that pet...it hurt so much. And especially losing one you've had that long. I had a cat that was about 10-12 years old pass a few months ago, I'm so sorry for the loss of your fur baby \ud83e\udd0d", "Your cat was a family member whom you saw every day for over a decade. Of COURSE you\u2019re sad. And while you may love your other cat, cats are not interchangeable. \n\nI\u2019m still occasionally sad over animals who died years ago. That just means you had a strong bond with your cat. It\u2019s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of and your family are arseholes if they harass you over being sad.", "NTA, it's not a competition. Your sister is AH for making it one \\*and\\* using it to kick you while you're down. This is the message I sent my friend after hearing her cat passed away, \"I wanted to say I saw that Pepper passed away, and I wanted to give my condolences. There's nothing I can say that will fully convey how painful it is to lose a loved one and fully comfort your pain and heartbreak, and pets are, while not humans, they're not not humans, and they're every bit a soul and member of our family, forever in our hearts, to have a pet is to be a masochist because they will always go before us, they are a ticking time bomb of grief, but it because of that, that having a pet is truly an exercise in insane hope and lovingkindness and that is beautiful. It must have been a difficult and challenging swirl of conflicting and difficult emotions. I hope you were able to find a moment of peace and comfort you deserve \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\". I gave the response to her I would have wanted to hear/have heard from losing two childhood cats and currently having a cat of my own as an adult. And this is from being raised by a mother who instilled in me the love of animals, cats specifically, who was raised the same by my grandmother. My mother lost a sister as a teen, a brother as an adult and both her parents. We grieved our two cats. When the one she got years before I was born and died two months after my uncle passed at age 16, I knew her grief didn't diminish her love for me as her daughter, even though part of her grief was for the woman she was when she got the cat, pre-becoming a mother and her companion when I was at my dad's after the divorce, and \\*certainly\\* didn't diminish her love for her brother, not just because he also was just as much of a pet person, but with dogs, she was grieving that time in her life. Our love, and therefore our grief, is not a limited/scarcity of resources, and it is certainly not a win/lose situation, your cat was a living, breathing creature with a soul that you had a relationship with, you loved your cat and your cat loved you and 12 years so I long time in any case but especially considering how young you are, this is hurt and hurt for a long time, and that's okay, you'll survive it \ud83d\udc9e", "NTA! Your feelings are valid and it\u2019s okay to cry! My cockatiel flew away two years ago which left me devastated and almost crying everyday because of it, I felt like it was something part of my life and I 100% understand that your cat was part of your life too, your sister sounded insensitive and should know how\u2019s like loosing a pet too.", "NTA.\n\nI mean, if you'd cried over your cat in the presence of your sister who'd recently lost a child, sure. But...like...there is no dead child here. There's a dead beloved pet. Who comes up with wild scenarios to tell someone to not mourn near them?", "NTA hell OP when our family rottie passed we all cried for a week solid. These 'animals' aren't pets they are our family. They love us unconditionally and without reserve. It's painful when they leave. That being said what your family members said was abhorrent and disgusting.", "NTA I lost my baby of 14 years on 1/3/23 I called out of work and to this day still cry I can't look at any of his things I had to put them away the first few nights I couldn't even feed my other babies (my hubby is a gods send he took care of everything I couldnt) bc my boy was always such a good eater even up to his last moments. I am not infertile (I think) but we are child free I regularly refer to my pets as a my mom's grand babies (and she's started to as well lol) \n\nWhen we decided to take on an animal they become part of us and it hurts emmensely to have that part taken away", "NTA. What was your sister's motivation other than to minimize your loss? And to put you into a position of having to defend your grief? What kind of loving supportive family are these people?\n\nI'm outraged on your behalf. You shouldn't have to point out that you love your cat and this hurts you very much. Your family should be ashamed for attacking you in your hour of need. I'm so sorry you have such garbage people in your family. Please show them this thread.", "NTA!!! I lost my 19yr old cat 2 weeks ago and I have cried almost every day since. No one gets to decide how you grieve.", "NTA - I have two kids and I still get wrecked whenever we lose a pet. They are part of the family. With all due lack of respect, fuck your sister and mom.", "So, so SO much NTA\n\nFirstly, I am sorry for your loss. Pets are members of the family and childhood pets, especially, have a lot of emotions attached to them. Take it from someone who still gets teary-eyed thinking about the fur baby I lost when I was 18.\n\nYour family is being unreasonable and quite cruel. You're grieving, and they're being callous about your feelings by, what? Reminding you of another pain? One that they all seem to say is worse than your current grief and that none of them know about? It's sick if you ask me.\n\nRight now I think you need to establish some boundaries with them. Let them know, bluntly, that you don't appreciate what they're saying and if they don't want to support you right now that they shouldn't talk to you. Hold firm, don't take their bullshit, and limit your contact with them until you can get to a better place emotionally. You'll be better equipped for dealing with their crap when your heart doesn't hurt so much.\n\nAnd then stop worrying about them and focus on you and what you need to heal. Self care, cathartic crying sessions, and being gentle with yourself will do wonders for you right now. Do little things that make you happy. Talk with a trusted friend, get a little sunshine (I know how hard that will be but sitting in the sun a bit really does work wonders on mood), and take care of yourself.\n\nI wish you well on your heart's recovery. And give some love to your other kitty. They might need some support right now themselves. You two can heal together.", "NTA. People who act that way make me assume they have never had an animal. You are right to be sad,  it doesn't matter how it compares to kids.", "Hey mom sorry you totalled your car but hey its not ad bad as losing a house so you should be grateful\"", "The only reason I would leave a pet to die alone would be if I was physically unable to get to them, like I was in prison or a coma and it would haunt me forever.", "NTA\nAre you kidding? A pet is the only thing in the world that gives you unconditional love.  The grief is very, very real.  \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and I'm so sorry your family are horrible.", "Lost my cat close to that age (16) in Dec 2021 and I still cry sometimes when I think about him. He had cancer and it took him in six weeks. It breaks my heart that he suffered so much.", "You're NTA. Your family sounds like they are completely without empathy. Sorry for your loss. Losing a beloved pet is brutal heartbreaking.", "Idk you should poison all their kids just to verify their claims. $20 says they\u2019ll actually be quite relieved. \n\n(These are JOKES do not harm children)", "What? They are the assholes. Sorry for your loss.", "First, I am very sorry for the loss of your beloved pet, a family member who shared your life for 12 years.  I have a child who has grown to a young man I love dearly, but no longer needs the mothering he once did.  I now surround myself with several cats I treat and spoil as the my other sons and daughters.  They bring my life such joy and fulfillment.  Unfortunately, I unexpectedly lost one a few months ago to a sudden illness.  I cried for days and it still hurts a bit when I see cats that look like him.\n\nNo, absolutely you are NTA for crying when you lost your cat, a loved, treasured member of your family.  Sadly there are others out there that cannot understand the bonds that form between humans and pets, especially in your situation where you may be unable to have a child.  Your family should have shown sympathy.  Again, I am very sorry for your loss.  Hugs\u2026", "NTA fuck your family.", "It's awful how your family is dismissing your feelings. Maybe you should go lc while you mourn the loss of your beloved cat. \n\nI know how painful this is. Our furry peeps are family. Grieving is how we honor the little beings we lost. \n\nTake your time. It will get easier.", "Nta\nHow exactly is saying your cats are the closest thing you have to kids saying that losing a pet is like losing a kid\nI'm so tired of people getting pissy about pet owners loving their pets and treating them well\nSome people can't or don't want to have kids\nSome parents are shitty as parents and treat their kids like shit, case in point, OP's family", "NTA. Shit family.", "NTA AT ALL. Animal companions are family and grief is not a competitive sport (especially not with hypothetical loss scenarios, wtf) Your sister was profoundly rude and heartless to you in a time when you would've needed her support the most.\n\nMy cat died last summer and even though I'm lucky enough to have an empathetic support network, r/petloss still helped me a lot. If you lack IRL support, please go find  your kindred there when you need it <3", "NTA a million times over. And anyone who cannot be empathetic when a person loses an animal companion is definitely a massive AH. I\u2019m so sorry about your loss. Please know you gave your feline friend the best possible life and all the love in the world. You were a wonderful mama- and continue to be to your other cat. Sending loads of sympathy.", "NTA. Grief shouldn\u2019t be a competition. So we can\u2019t be upset and grieve unless our grief is the greatest of all? This is ridiculous. Your sister and your family are very strange in their reaction to the loss of your beloved pet. How hard is it to show some empathy when another is hurting? The loss of a pet is so hard because they really do give such unconditional, endless love. I am so sorry for your loss, and don\u2019t let your miserable family make you feel badly about feeling sad after the loss of a beloved companion, whether furry or not.", "NTA- your beloved cat is a part of your family and you are grieving after 10 years together. \n\nIt is fine to view yourself as a pet parent and raising your pet animals as the closest to having a child that you will ever experience.  Your sister is TA, your mother and cousin too.", "NTA, I feel you, OP. My cat is 14, I've had her for nearly half of my life. I cry when she even looks like she's having a rough day. Do not feel bad at all, we are their whole lives and they deserve to be loved and mourned.", "NTA. So no one is allowed to cry unless its over a lost child? You have some shitty family members. I think it would be weirder if you didn't cry over losing a beloved pet.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss. We call them fur or feather babies for a reason. I'm sure that you gave your fur baby a wonderful life.", "When aunt lost her cat, my family went over with food and comforted her. She had that cat for over a decade, he was her first one. Now she only has two others left. Feels weird to be over at her house without the third cat sometimes. I\u2019m sorry for you loss and hope it gets better. NTA", "I lost a cat back when I was in 7th grade her death literally made me upset to the point of where I didn\u2019t go to school for a couple of days", "Literally tell all of them to fuck off and leave you alone. It doesn't matter if you are infertile. If the animal feels like a child to you then to you a child died. If they don't like it say, \"I don't respect your opinion and I'm done talking about this. Leave me alone\" then ignore them. They call then you hang up, they text, you leave them on read, etc. NTA", "NTA and I am so sorry for your loss. Our cats are our family, and losing them is absolutely something to grieve as strongly as you need to.", "NTA  Losing a pet is worse than losing a kid.", "I agree. NTA.

Your sister is extremely out of line, and honestly you should block her for a while.", "\n>it\u2019s not as bad as losing a kid.\n\nAnd losing a kid isn't as bad as losing every single member of your family when your house is bombed.

Ignore your heartless family and grieve as much as you need to.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. NTA", "NTA. Losing a pet is one of the hardest things you can go through. You care for them, love them, and receive so much love from them in return. Why wouldn't you feel grief when they pass? Your family is being needlessly cruel. I'm sorry for your loss. Don't let them try to minimize your grief. You're allowed to feel it.", "I have cats, 55m now.  I had an adorable female manx, that I had since she was barely weaned.  Just before she turned 5 years old, she caught FIP.  Right before Thanksgiving.  I tried everything possible to save her,  She died January of 2011.  I was absolutely devastated.  Until she passed I truly did not understand how much I loved that cat.  I did eventually get another cat that helped filled the void, but she never replaced the one that passed.    \n\n\nThe reason I say all of this is because I had similar experiences.  Not like you lost a child.  You can get another one and so on.  I truly cried for her loss, what she went through.  No over 12 years later, I still think of her and miss her terribly.   I do not have children, not married anymore either.   So my pets do fill those gaps in my life.  Grief also hits people differently.  So I say, go through your grief.   Experience it.  The love you had for your cat, deserves the grief you have.  Your cat was fortunate to have someone who cared so much for her/him.  Your family ITA and should be ashamed of not supporting you.  Give your surviving cat good attention also, that cat is now alone, lost its companion also.", "OMG NTA at all!!!  It is absolutely horrible that anyone, especially your family would say that to you. The love you clearly had for the cat doesn't mean it is insignificant because it is not a human child. I can tell your fur baby meant the world to you.

My 70 y/o dad lost his 17 y/o cat a few weeks ago. He was retired during most of the cat's life and they were constant companions. This cat was our family; his best friend. His grief has been intense, and he told me it was worse than losing his own mother (who yes, he loved). He's working through it, a few weeks on, but it's *hard*. Grieve, my friend, and ignore these idiots. Do not engage. I'm so sorry for the loss of your cat.\n\nIt also sounds like none of you have ever lost a kid (unless I'm reading somethin wrong?) so wtf, where is this coming from?!", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for your loss", "NTA.
