The pscd teacher (call her Jen) and her aid are constantly in my room using materials, taking them, and using them for their students. Everyone has their own classroom, we do not share rooms. At the beginning of the year, the class was a hybrid of pscd and regular pre-K which the Jen taught. However, since October the class has been split and the room now belongs to just the afternoon pre-K class and she has her own separate room. \n\nYesterday afternoon I had set up a center for my students to be prepared for today. When I got to work the glue bottles I placed there were gone. My aid and I were looking all over for them and I thought I had misplaced them. Come to find out Jen took the bottles in the morning and never returned them or notified me. After school I went to her to get the rest of the bottles back and asked her and her aid to stop taking things out the room because I didn\u2019t have materials I needed for my students. \n\nJen told me I was rude and that all materials are for all of pre-K and I need to be a team player and share materials. I told her I don\u2019t have a problem sharing but I need to be asked first. She said I\u2019m not here in the morning, so she can\u2019t ask me. I\u2019ve never been at a school where teachers can just take things out of another teachers room and use it as they want.\n\nAm I in the wrong here ? This is my first year teaching besides my experience long term subbing and regular substituting.\n\nUpdate: Jen and I had a conversation today. I said I would try not to be as blunt and that I understand she\u2019s use to using the room as a free for all but I would like to at least get a text about using supplies. She also said I seem ungrateful for all the help their offering. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1681992623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12swjjo/aita_for_telling_a_teacher_to_stop_going_in_my/", "score": 306, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Encourage them to order their own, and put materials in bins clearly marked with your name. Label as much individual equipment as you can- staplers, pencil sharpeners, etc. Ugh, school.", "NTA. File a complaint with the principal or whoever else could handle it.", "Both. We have a supply manager at the school, who you can order supplies from. Then you can buy anything else you may want on your own.", "Yeah this.\n\nIt\u2019s not just disrupting you but it\u2019s disrupting students learning as well. What if you had needed the glue first thing and she\u2019d taken it to use in her classroom? Now the whole plans out the window.\n\nDef talk to principal and maybe the person who orders the materials to find out the policies.", "This is the best way to phrase the concern. To bring up that OP likes to prep her room in advance and if supplies are taken with out warning it leaves her racing around to find more.", "The door is locked. But Jen and her aid are in my room in the morning working with a student, so when I come in at 11 the door is already unlocked and they have been in the room.", "Everyone has there own classroom stocked with supplies. We can order supplies though school supply manager. From my understanding, the classrooms aren\u2019t a free for all on taking supplies out when you want to. If given supplies for the grade level they are divided up so everyone has their own.", "Yeah, NTA. I edited my post based on the information.", "Then anything you bought should be hoped up and taken with you home and brought with you in the morning. So they can't take your things.", "your best bet will be to try to talk to them again or bring in mats when you go in which isnt nearly as convenient", "NTAH...", "Can you start locking your classroom doors?\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would be complaining to the Principal about there disrespecting your classroom supplies", "There\u2019s a budget per class for supplies, I can promise you there is. She\u2019s stealing your supplies so she has extra budget for her class.\n\nTake this issue to your supply manager and principal.", "Or get the supply manager to ~~order a~~ change the lock ~~for~~ on the door. Because taking all your supplies home means you can\u2019t set the room up the night before, and have to waste time doing it in the morning.", "Honestly.  You need to find out whats normal at your school.  Its easy to judge, but each school has its own unwritten rules.  Talk to another staff member to find out whats normal there.", "\nAsk your principal what the policy is. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re paying for the supplies then fuck no. No one touches your stuff.", "NTA put all your supplies in a place that you can lock.", "NTA my mom was an art teacher, and other teachers were constantly raiding her supplies and ruining her lessons.  It sucks.  At the very least, they could borrow something quickly and return it, or simply ask to borrow stuff.\n\nI think I'd talk to the administration, and to start with don't even name names, just let them know you're having an issue with supplies going missing, including supplies you had prepped for a lesson, which was then delayed.  If nothing happens, then you have to escalate it.", "Why are you asking us?  Ask the principal what the protocol is or lock your materials in a lock box.  No judgement to be made.", "NTA", "NTA", "Not true. I\u2019ve never worked in a school that had money set aside per classroom. Supplies were pooled and shared between teachers. Teachers also spent a lot of their own money on supplies.", "There is no budget. I work on post, there\u2019s plenty of money for everyone for basic supplies: pencils, glue, paper, etc.", "INFO was Jen getting supplies from this room before you started? What was the division of materials like when you started? Did you inherit everything in the room when you took over? Was Jen allowed to fully stock her new room?", "Tell them that you have your room set the night before and not to touch the set up.  It\u2019s completely unprofessional of her to trample all over your classroom like that.  I would be upset too.  She is TAH, not you.", "The room was Jens classroom at the beginning of the year because the class was both sped and regular. After a month or two of school the classes were split and Jen got her own room across the hall. My class didn\u2019t have an official teacher until I was hired in match. Hence why Jen kept using the room as an extra room she can use as she wants to. The class room is now mine with everything in it. I\u2019ve told jen  and  take her things that she bought out but she hasn\u2019t yet such as books and caddies. I have no problem buying things I need. We work on a military base, the schools are well funded and the school provided all supplies such as tables, chairs, scissors, crayons, glue, easels, paint, center games, rugs, etc. you just let the supply manager know what you need and he gives it out to you. I\u2019ve been trying to reach the supply manager myself to order my class more supplies. The only stuff a teacher would have to buy is if they want a specific kind of supply or decor.", "Consider that teachers spend their own pay on supplies, because the system knows that teachers are the exact kind of people who will feel guilty enough for the kids to spend their own money. \n\nNevertheless I encourage you, dont spend your own money on your job just because fuck that", "Get a lockbox, and put the supplies in there :)", "NTA, if you\u2019ve planned a lesson/activity and left stuff out in order to use it and then it disappears when you\u2019re about to start a class, that\u2019s annoying as heck.\n\nI work as a substitute teacher at the moment and I wouldn\u2019t dream of moving stuff around and taking things like the way you\u2019re describing is happening to you.\n\nEdit: wording clarity", "NTA \n\nYou need to go to your supervisor/principle and tell them what\u2019s going on and that it\u2019s leaving your students in your room without the materials they need for class because she keeps stealing them. See what they tell you to do, or let them handle it. I guarantee there\u2019s a budget per classroom (even if you\u2019re not specifically aware of it) for what\u2019s a reasonable amount that should be allocated. She\u2019s stealing your supplies so she can get more stuff for her own room. There\u2019s absolutely zero reason she can\u2019t ask the supply manager to supply her with the things she\u2019s taking from you, unless she\u2019s purposefully not doing so for deceitful reasons. \n\n\u201cThe supplies is for all of pre-k\u201d no it\u2019s not. The supplies it\u2019s for the pre-k students in your specific classroom, and the supplies she has is for pre-k students in her room. She\u2019s being manipulative op, don\u2019t fall for her bs. It\u2019s also like you said not about not wanting to share, at this point it\u2019s the principle of lacking respect for you and your room. My sisters a teacher and her rooms like her second home it\u2019s her space, it\u2019s fucked up for someone to just come in and do whatever they want without your knowledge it shows a lack of respect. I\u2019m sure if she came to do and laid out a specific predicament and asked for you to share so long and she returned them before your class, you would\u2019ve agreed. She didn\u2019t though, because she doesn\u2019t have a predicament she\u2019s just taking advantage and thinks you\u2019re dumb enough to be manipulated. \n\nETA: \u201cShe said I\u2019m not here in the morning so she can\u2019t ask me\u201d no but there\u2019s plenty of other teachers she could ask, she likely knows they won\u2019t do it though because there\u2019s no actual need for it. You: \u201cI\u2019ve never been at a school where teachers can just takes things out or another teachers room and use it as they want\u201d that\u2019s because it\u2019s disrespectful it\u2019s poor manners. If you let it continue her entitlement is only going to get worse and she\u2019s only going to continue to take more, or refuse to give it back because \u201cshe needs it more\u201d. When you don\u2019t put a stop to peoples entitlement or block their manipulations they only get worse op.", "NTA! I was a public school teacher for 31 years. Where I worked, what you are describing would never be ok. Each day after school I would set up my room with everything I needed for the next day. Someone taking my supplies would have completely screwed up my plans.", "NTA. \nAfter reading the comments, sounds like she\u2019s messing with you. Is there any way for you to lock the door?? We have 1 person at our school who\u2019s in charge of issuing room keys. I\u2019d talk to her and make sure no one gave your coworker a key or opened the door for her. Also, do you have a closet or drawer that you can lock?", "Thanks! I think I\u2019m sitting at NAH. I completely understand your frustration, but I also understand why Jen\u2019s treating it like her room (she\u2019s still using it some before you get there, right?). I think a polite conversation with her, especially about the things that you\u2019ve already set out, is needed and acknowledging that it\u2019s been a change for her, too. If that doesn\u2019t work escalate it to the principal.\n\nAdd: it does suck for Jen that she\u2019s been shifted around so much this school year. The blurring of the classroom lines seems to be driving the problem from an outsiders POV. If she wasn\u2019t using your room for one of her students it might not be an issue.", "Yeah I have no issues then using it in the morning. They work with a blind student and her supplies are in there. It\u2019s just hard to feel that the room is mine when other people are in there using things. There\u2019s been times I\u2019ve been in the room working before or after the kids come and Jen or her aid come in and just go into the bathroom to use some scissors without even asking or being like hey do you mind. I just feel like I\u2019m not getting respect as an education in that classroom."]}
