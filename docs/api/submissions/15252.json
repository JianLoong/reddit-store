Encourage them to order their own, and put materials in bins clearly marked with your name. Label as much individual equipment as you can- staplers, pencil sharpeners, etc. Ugh, school.", "NTA. File a complaint with the principal or whoever else could handle it.", "Both. We have a supply manager at the school, who you can order supplies from. Then you can buy anything else you may want on your own.", "Yeah this.\n\nIt\u2019s not just disrupting you but it\u2019s disrupting students learning as well. What if you had needed the glue first thing and she\u2019d taken it to use in her classroom? Now the whole plans out the window.\n\nDef talk to principal and maybe the person who orders the materials to find out the policies.", "This is the best way to phrase the concern. To bring up that OP likes to prep her room in advance and if supplies are taken with out warning it leaves her racing around to find more.", "The door is locked. But Jen and her aid are in my room in the morning working with a student, so when I come in at 11 the door is already unlocked and they have been in the room.", "Everyone has there own classroom stocked with supplies. We can order supplies though school supply manager. From my understanding, the classrooms aren\u2019t a free for all on taking supplies out when you want to. If given supplies for the grade level they are divided up so everyone has their own.", "Yeah, NTA. I edited my post based on the information.", "Then anything you bought should be hoped up and taken with you home and brought with you in the morning. So they can't take your things.", "your best bet will be to try to talk to them again or bring in mats when you go in which isnt nearly as convenient", "NTAH...", "Can you start locking your classroom doors?\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would be complaining to the Principal about there disrespecting your classroom supplies", "There\u2019s a budget per class for supplies, I can promise you there is. She\u2019s stealing your supplies so she has extra budget for her class.\n\nTake this issue to your supply manager and principal.", "Or get the supply manager to ~~order a~~ change the lock ~~for~~ on the door. Because taking all your supplies home means you can\u2019t set the room up the night before, and have to waste time doing it in the morning.", "Honestly.  You need to find out whats normal at your school.  Its easy to judge, but each school has its own unwritten rules.  Talk to another staff member to find out whats normal there.", "\nAsk your principal what the policy is. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re paying for the supplies then fuck no. No one touches your stuff.", "NTA put all your supplies in a place that you can lock.", "NTA my mom was an art teacher, and other teachers were constantly raiding her supplies and ruining her lessons.  It sucks.  At the very least, they could borrow something quickly and return it, or simply ask to borrow stuff.\n\nI think I'd talk to the administration, and to start with don't even name names, just let them know you're having an issue with supplies going missing, including supplies you had prepped for a lesson, which was then delayed.  If nothing happens, then you have to escalate it.", "Why are you asking us?  Ask the principal what the protocol is or lock your materials in a lock box.  No judgement to be made.", "NTA", "NTA", "Not true. I\u2019ve never worked in a school that had money set aside per classroom. Supplies were pooled and shared between teachers. Teachers also spent a lot of their own money on supplies.", "There is no budget. I work on post, there\u2019s plenty of money for everyone for basic supplies: pencils, glue, paper, etc."]}
