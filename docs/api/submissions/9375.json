I was her MOH. My sister said that no children would be allowed at her wedding as they are loud and noisy. I brought my 15yo daughter because her aunt was getting married and she wanted to wish her well!\n\nAt the wedding, my parents were shooting me daggers, and my sister came over furious. She asked \"Who was I to completely disregard her rules?\". I was confused until she pointed out that my daughter should not be there. I argued, saying that the reason she didn't want children there was because they would misbehave. My daughter was silent, never on her phone, and was extremely respectful.\n\nI left the wedding early and my parents are blowing up my phone with angry texts. My husband agrees with me, but says I could have handled the situation better. My sister is refusing to speak with me until I apologize, but I don't think I did anything wrong. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: Based on the responses, I understand that I was rude for not at least checking in first. I should have verified whether or not my daughter could come. There was no mal intent, but all the same I will apologize to my sister and daughter. My sister and daughter are very close, another reason why I thought she would have been invited.\n\nEdit 2: I have seen these questions a lot so :The invite was a pretty generic card that said \"We hope to see you at our wedding!\", with the RSVP info, dresscode, etc. I RSVP'd two people, my daughter and I. I believe my sister thought the two RSVPs were my husband and I. My husband did not attend as he was suddenly called out of town for a work conference. There was a place setting, chair, etc, for my daughter because I RSVP'd two people. I assumed my daughter would be allowed because my sister stated that she didn't want children at the wedding due to noise, tantrums, misbehavior, etc.", "created_utc": 1675789468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w6z7c/aita_for_bringing_my_daughter_to_a_childfree/", "score": 2664, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you'd asked that would be one thing - I can see the argument that a 15 year old wouldn't be as disruptive as a younger kid.

I can 100% understand where you're coming from, and it's likely your daughter may have been allowed, but at the end of the day, you never asked if she was. \"Child\" is pretty universally understood to be anyone under 18, which your daughter is.

You could have asked since she is practically an adult already, could an exception be made. You could have asked if there was some way to include your daughter that wouldn\u2019t be disruptive. Instead you simply ignored what she asked for and did what you wanted. It was a very a\u2019hole move.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like there was any reason to not understand that your daughter wasn\u2019t invited.

You had good intentions and your daughter was well behaved, but you still went against your sister's wishes.  The least you could have done was at least ask her well ahead of time, instead of surprising her with your daughter on the day of her wedding.  \n\nPeople could have also noticed that there was a kid at the wedding, after them themselves being told they couldn't bring kids to the wedding and wondered why someone else was allowed to do this when they weren't.

What part of this do you not understand?", "YTA because you knew it was childfree & brought your child. Also YTA for putting your daughter through that.

It doesn't matter if your daughter was so quiet that lifelong ninja would be jealous.  \n\nThey said \"No kids\"  You brought your daughter.  That's a blatant slap in their face.  And it could also create a lot of drama for them, because other parents who complied with the rule might be mad at the couple now.  \"We had to pay for babysitting, why didn't she?\"  So the couple might be getting bombed with texts from other parents demanding to know why your daughter was there when their kids were not.\n\nThey will think they favored you, rather than you just flouted the rule because Your Child Is Special.\n\nYou owe your sister and husband a profound apology.

If you don't want to, it is perfectly proper not to go instead.", "You brought someone who obviously wasn't invited, so yes, YTA.\n\nDo I think it was stupid to not invite a teenage niece?  Yes.

If you're close enough to your sister to be MOH, then I'd be offended too that your 15 year old wasn't invited. What was her reasoning for childfree...was it regarding drinking/partying? That too many people had kids/teenagers and she couldn't afford it. Does the couple have other nieces/nephews.\n\n\nBut her name was not on the invitation. It said \"Bob and Jen Smith.\" Not \"Bob, Jen, and Susie Smith\" or \"The Smith Family\". You brought someone who wasn't invited. Presumably, you had to fill out an RSVP card.....who did you RSVP for? \n\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't even see you as an AH for stepping down as MOH or not going because your daughter wasn't invited. If your sister doesn't want a relationship with your daughter, it's okay to not want as close of a relationship with her.\n\n\nBut your daughter wasn't invited. And you never brought it up.

Honest mistake, if your sister didn't clarify she meant everyone under 18, it's easy to think that a 15 year old doesn't count as a child. They are legally considered minors and can't drink, but they otherwise act like adults, so while it is perfectly legitimate to exclude everyone under 18 (or even 21 due to drinking concerns), it should be specified - though OP should probably also have double-checked. But there's no clear etiquette on whether teens count as children in the case of childfree weddings (calling it an adults-only wedding would have been a different scenario). In this scenario, both the bride and OP share responsibility for not clarifying (if the invite didn't specifically invite only OP and her husband, that again added to the lack of clarity). There's a million ways in which this scenario could have been avoided.\n\nThe reason I am suggesting that the bride is the asshole here is two-fold: 1) she came in very hot and aggressive, that shouldn't have been the first response unless there's a history of acrimony between the two - and if the sister is close with her daughter, it's probably not that bad, and 2) I think everyone has missed that OP gave birth at 17 and was probably pregnant at 16, so there is an obvious reason why she wouldn't clock \"adult\" as being 18+", "Is your daughter 18+?

In bringing them, it's not that your SPECIFIC child is a problem, it's that the wedding party doesn't want to make rules that force them into picking and choosing what kids are good and what kids are bad. Letting one well-behaved kid attend and not others would be setting the stage for some crazy drama after the fact.

If she\u2019s taking it so far, my guess is she\u2019s super cheap and didn\u2019t want to pay for an extra seat for kids as it\u2019s not like her 15 year old niece would misbehave.
