You do not owe that to her or anyone else. You called her out on it and stood up for yourself - massive well done. She needs to take it from there to grow as a human being and figure this out.\n\nAnd for non British people who might not realize, Paki is a well known slur in the UK with a massive complex background tied to discrimination, racism and abuse. It is not socially acceptable to use it and this person is capable of googling \"is paki offensive\" and reading why.", "NTA. Her response is what makes it most hurtful in my opinion \n\n>> That\u2019s not a slur don\u2019t overreact!\n\nHonestly, it is possible that someone might not know that it is a slur. But, she immediately doubled down and **told you to not overreact**. She did not want to learn, she decided only her opinion matters. That makes her a huge AH.", "NTA I\u2019m from a predominantly white background but I knew when I was in uni over 10 years ago that that was a slur and the thought never crossed my mind to use it. Your classmate can learn and do better (without you shouldering the burden of explaining it to her).", "NTA. It's a slur. If she didn't know, she didn't know I guess, but you don't owe her a lesson on the word's history. If she wants to understand she can look it up. She should have accepted \"it's a slur\" from someone that slur is levied against, not argued with you that it isn't.", "NTA. It's not your personal responsibility to reach everyone individually how not to be racist. It's their responsibility to learn... on their own efforts, not yours. You told her the part she needed in order to do her own research from there: that the word was a slur and deeply offensive. She has the tools to find out if she wanted to know more detail. Or she could have just said \"Oh! I'm so sorry!\" and not used it again. Either way, she had choices that did not involve your holding her hand while she figured it all out.", "NTA You let her know it was offensive and instead of apologizing and moving on she is doubling down.", "You are NTA.\n\nI live in a village from up north and P_ki and Ch_nky are both very commonly used here. An acquaintance's son was given a detention for calling his friend a ch_nky in school and she was clueless as to why it was offensive, \"it's just the nickname for the Chinese takeaway\".\n\nEveryone here is under the impression that P_ki is also just an abbreviation of Pakistani. I've also tried communicating that these are slurs and been told that I'm incorrect.\n\n\u2022Edited to fix spelling errors and hopefully fix the weird formatting from my phone", "NTA. She has the power of Google. Dealing with bigotry is exhausting.", "NTA.\n\nIt is a racist slur.\n\nHer being from a small all-white village makes no difference.

Even if she didn\u2019t know it was a slur, she should\u2019ve apologized in the moment and googled to educate herself instead of accusing you of overreacting.\n\nOr even if in the moment she reacted defensively (everyone hates hearing criticism and not everyone handles it well in the moment, though that is not an excuse for shitty behaviour), there was plenty of time afterwards to reflect and apologise. It\u2019s not your responsibility to deal with her issues.", "NTA. You're not obligated to take on labor of educating bigots. You told her not to call you that, if she cared about you as a person she would have said I'm sorry instead of doubling down.", "Definitely NTA. Your friend is clearly a little ignorant and needs educating. Perhaps it's not entirely her fault, since you said she comes from somewhere that mainly consists of white people. But still, it's not your job to educate anyone. You already made her aware that it's a slur. She is more than welcome and more than capable of doing her own research, asking you about it, or just simply never saying it again. I wouldn't want to explain it to her either - I'd personally feel so awkward!", "NTA. Educating someone on these things is *exhausting*. It's emotional labor, and it's something you have to deal with all the time so discussing that topic can be traumatic for some people. Sometimes people don't know something is wrong or offensive! A couple months ago I had the \"don't use spirit animal to refer to kinning or heavily relating to something, that's appropriation and turns indigenous culture into a commodity\" conversation on here. The person who used it apologized immediately and thanks those who let them know. Not everyone can know everything, and it doesn't sound like you were expecting her to. \n\nHow someone *responds* when told what they're saying or doing is harmful is the important part. She said *don't overreact* and claimed it wasn't a slur, despite you, someone of that ethnicity, telling her in was. *That* was out of line and makes her the AH. You're right, she very easily could do her own research, and if she wants to study politics, she should know how to even more so because a large portion of that field is knowing how to properly research sensitive topics and how to separate biased sources from legitimate ones. If your parents want to have that mindset, they can apply it to themselves. But no one is entitled to your emotional labor, especially not when they're downplaying the significance of it", "NTA\n\nIt is not your job to explain all of that to your friends and acquaintances. That would be exhausting. If your friend doesn't believe you when you say that it's an offensive slur, then she's not much of a friend to begin with.", ">Oh I didn\u2019t realise you were a Pi \n\n\n\nDo you mean \u201cP a k i\u201d?

Growing up in Canada with no large Spanish communities, I thought nothing of calling my dog Spik because I like calling him weird things. I heard a joke on the internet that alluded to Spik being a slur, googled it, and never called him that again. It\u2019s not that hard.", "NTA I'm not even from Britain and even i know how it's used as a slur", "NTA. I\u2019m a SEA Chinese who studied up north in the UK for uni, and one of my local white friends when we went out for lunch for the first time, asked me if I ate dogs. \n\nThe difference though, is my friend was mortified and apologised profusely after I explained how racist and offensive that question was. And now she\u2019s one of my closest friends, so I still tease her about it years later as is my right.\n\nWhereas Izzy here is doubling down on her ignorance and acting as if she knows better about racism towards your ethnicity and culture than you. Theres no teaching someone who doesn\u2019t want to learn. That makes her the AH here, not you.", "NTA\n\nShe definitely knows it's offensive. \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of Brits feign ignorance/use passive-aggressive comments just to have an opportunity to be racist.", "NTA - unlike many commenters, I am from the UK. You would have to be living under a rock here to not know that this is a slur.\n\nFor context/interest, there are actually many slurs predominantly used in America that I had no idea were slurs until being chronically online and reading a lot.", "So I (20s UK) actually had no idea that was a slur until a bit earlier this year. Honest to god, I genuinely thought it was just an innocent abbreviation for Pakistani (Thank god I never actually used it).\nWhen I heard that it was offensive there was a moment of incredulity, a bit of disbelief, then I went and looked it up and had that \"ohhhh...\" moment.\n\nSo I can get her defensiveness over it, becuase if I had actually been going casually saying it then the \"Oh god I've been doing something horrible without even realising it\" would have been a much harder pill to swallow, and a lot of people don't want to entertain that possibility at all and live in the denial land of \"I haven't been saying an offensive thing, you're just wrong.\"\n\nBut that said, it's entirely her problem and not yours. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure that she doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a slur, but it is theoretically possible not to. That being said, given that the sentence was pretty problematic in and of itself, and that she immediately dismissed your concerns when you pointed it out, I\u2019d be inclined towards thinking that she is aware it\u2019s a pejorative term but doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s not easy to confront your friends, but you were absolutely right to here. It shouldn\u2019t be your job to explain the history of prejudice to your friends", "NTA Tell your lecturer - the one who led the British Raj class, that there are students who have used this term and have an embarrassing knowledge gap that you challenged them on and they rebuffed you. Discrimination that persists today should be included in the next discussion, this is not acceptable. \n\nShe could be sacked if she said this in the workplace, better she learns now.\n\nA friend would have apologised and corrected the terms they use immediately. Sorry some people are still so uninformed. It shouldn\u2019t be your job to convince them that what they said was offensive.", "I was born in the early 90s in a white working class community and as a kid I remember everyone would say \"paki shop\" in reference to the newsagent and \"chinky\" in reference to the chinese takeaway.\n\nThere was never any malice behind it but for the most part people have stopped using these phrases (at least not publicly as especially not in the company of someone of that race) for the best part of 20 years now because they have realised these are slurs.\n\nI find it difficult to believe that someone of university age exists in some little bubble where these terms are still commonplace and no one knows they are offensive.\n\nI can understand someone elderly who is set in their ways but I would expect someone born after these terms were deemed unacceptable to know better.", "Ah, the all-white village. I didn't know those still existed--I grew up in one myself but that was back in mumble mumble. Where I live now is mostly white, admittedly.\n\nShe's perfectly capable of researching this for herself so no you're NTA for not wanting to do the legwork. I think you were already trying to ensure she doesn't use that term to anyone else, but you don't control her, and there's no guarantee that anything you say will convince her anyway.\n\nStill, a Politics student? She could just, yanno, ask her tutor.... If she actually wants not to offend.", "NTA, with a caution.\nIt's conceivable, although far-fetched, that she'd not realized it was an offensive term.\nNo, you're not an asshole for not being in the mood to enlighten your benighted friend, but you're in a good position to do it, possibly without vitriol..", "In my opinion you're not the AH, the friends a right ahole in this. Even so if she somehow wasn't aware of the fact she's using a slur (doesn't justify the word being in her vocabulary though) she didn't even acknowledge the effect of the word. Confronting her on it when she seems oblivious to that. It can be awkward and weird to try and explain something like that to someone and it's understandable that you don't want to, though, you're parents arent wrong though", "NTA. I wasn\u2019t aware it was a slur (I don\u2019t live in the UK) but she doubled down on it. Not even an apology or acknowledge that she did wrong (even unintentionally)", "NTA.  If she's at University then we have to presume that she has the intelligence to look up why using the P-word is offensive.  It's not your job to sit her down and explain everything to her.  I don't buy the \"oh I'm an innocent country bumpkin from a village in the middle of nowhere!\" either - she's, what, twenty years old and she's *never* been told using that word is offensive?  I call bullshit, madam, bullshit.  And good luck with your studies!", "NTA - how on earth is she from the UK and does not realise that's a slur?!", "NTA - and a note to everyone on here not from the UK - here it is exactly like using the N word and then claiming you didn't know it was a slur.", "NTA. And how does she not know what that word means or entails?! Being from the North is no excuse, people in the North are equally aware as the South and she choosing to be ignorant is not on being a Northerner. Tell her to learn about things before blabbing her mouth and then actually defending it!", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't matter if she thinks that it isn't a slur. What matters is that it bothers you. You have told her that you consider it a slur and don't like it's use. That should be enough.", "I have mixed feelings on this because \n\na) as someone who is of Indian descent in the Caribbean there are slurs used towards us and I have had to shut it down from others who thought they were being cool. I didn\u2019t get into it, I just said yeah no you don\u2019t get to use that term because that\u2019s a slur. Did they learn? Maybe but also we are not a common enough group where I live and it\u2019s not a common term so not likely to come up again.\n\nb) where I live \u201ca packie\u201d is a liquor store and have had to explain when someone used the term in conversation where someone if British south Asian descent was that other person (an American) wasn\u2019t aware this was a slur but it\u2019s a slang used for something else. \n\nI always think education is better but it\u2019s also exhausting to have to educate the world and it IS a well known slur even if she lived in a mostly white area. So NTA cause you\u2019re entitled to not have to explain everything to everyone but I do think you need to just explain to this person that \u201cif they can\u2019t understand why what they said is offensive it isn\u2019t your job to have to explain it to her but until she can understand and educate herself you need to take a break from your friendship\u201d", "NTA - there is no chance in hell she didn't know that was offensive.

A grown woman taking political classes *knows.* NTA", "NTA. I didn't realise it was a slur until I was 12 and saw Bend It Like Beckham. A character in it refers to herself that way when she's ranting about the racist treatment she often receives (immediately followed by a white man minimising her experience because he knows about racism because he's *Irish*, not great). My brain went \"okay, bad word, don't use.\"\n\nYour classmate, and I'm using that word because I don't think she's a good friend at all, is *doubling down* because [checks notes] she's from a small, predominantly white community, who have decided that it's okay. It is *not* your job to educate her, and it is *certainly* not your job to correct someone whose pride is more important than being a bigot.", "NTA. Not your job to educate racists.\n\nI literally gasped when I saw what she'd said.

She's rude", "NTA, I'm late 40s and grew up in the UK with people around me using that word to describe the local corner shop, didn't use it myself as I was taught from very young that it's a disrespectful word. \n\nShe knows what she did, sorry but no way she doesn't, and if she grew up using it and it came out by an old habit, she should've immediately apologised.", "As someone raised in the north - that is no reason to use racial slurs and I\u2019m not convinced that anyone wouldn\u2019t know it was offensive\u2026 maybe if she had a very sheltered upbringing and racist parents.

Everyone in this country knows (even the majority of children) not to use it as it will get them into trouble.

This girl, listening to your personal experiences and hearing the emotion in your voice, sitting face to face with you, being educated by her friend who, unlike Google, can make her see how much she hurt you, would have a far better understanding of why it's a slur, and why her dismissal of you saying so was ignorant and hurtful. I was out with my partner one night with a group of friends and acquaintances. This one girl kept using a slur when speaking to him like she thought it was ok to use because she was hanging out with him (I'm not going to say where he's from or what the slur was). He's not the type to get confrontational unless I'm the one being bothered or harassed so he just ignored her. After a few times I said listen that's not really something you should be saying because it's actually quite insulting. She kept saying oh it doesn't bother him see?? Says it again. A few more times and I LOST it. I physically attacked this girl so bad, she ended up with a black eye, A patch of hair missing, and a bruised rib, some scratches and stuff. Needless to say I learned the hard way to keep my emotions in check and had I explained WHY it was so hurtful instead of lunging at her maybe the outcome would have been different. Obviously our stories are incredibly different, but the point I'm trying to make is that perhaps your friend could use a little grace and instead of telling her to figure it out, maybe use this  as a learning opportunity where going forward she has the knowledge to correctly and rightfully call people out and educate them, and not just with some snippets from Google.", "As a fellow paki, I would say explain it to her.
