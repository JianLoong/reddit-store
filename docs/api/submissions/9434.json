We were talking about the politics of the Partition and Izzy asked why I seemed so passionate about the topic so I said \u201cwell because that\u2019s where my family is from!\u201d\n\nAnd then she said \u201cOh I didn\u2019t realise you were a *Paki* I thought you were Arabic!\u201d\n\nThere are so many things wrong with that sentence. But well. I have had that same P word weaponised against me and members of my family suffered violence specifically because of our heritage by people using that word.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe she would use it and I told her \u201cDon\u2019t ever use that slur again!\u201d\n\nShe started saying\u201dHow is that offensive? That\u2019s not a slur don\u2019t overreact!\u201d\n\nI left the study group and I haven\u2019t directly spoken to her since. She text me to say I\u2019m being ridiculous and how is it even a slur so I told her that if she\u2019s studying Politics she should know how or at least figure out how to look it up.\n\nWhen I mentioned it to my parents they said that i should have sat and explained the history to her and that I have a responsibility to make sure she doesn\u2019t use it to anyone else\n\nDoes not wanting to do that make me the AH?\n\n(**EDIT:** it is recognised in the UK by the relevant govt authorities as being a slur equally as offensive as the n word and has been for years)", "created_utc": 1675853774, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wtqjc/aita_for_not_wanting_to_explain_to_a_friend_why/", "score": 239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You do not owe that to her or anyone else. You called her out on it and stood up for yourself - massive well done. She needs to take it from there to grow as a human being and figure this out.\n\nAnd for non British people who might not realize, Paki is a well known slur in the UK with a massive complex background tied to discrimination, racism and abuse. It is not socially acceptable to use it and this person is capable of googling \"is paki offensive\" and reading why.", "NTA. Her response is what makes it most hurtful in my opinion \n\n>> That\u2019s not a slur don\u2019t overreact!\n\nHonestly, it is possible that someone might not know that it is a slur. But, she immediately doubled down and **told you to not overreact**. She did not want to learn, she decided only her opinion matters. That makes her a huge AH.", "NTA I\u2019m from a predominantly white background but I knew when I was in uni over 10 years ago that that was a slur and the thought never crossed my mind to use it. Your classmate can learn and do better (without you shouldering the burden of explaining it to her).", "NTA. It's a slur. If she didn't know, she didn't know I guess, but you don't owe her a lesson on the word's history. If she wants to understand she can look it up. She should have accepted \"it's a slur\" from someone that slur is levied against, not argued with you that it isn't.", "NTA. It's not your personal responsibility to reach everyone individually how not to be racist. It's their responsibility to learn... on their own efforts, not yours. You told her the part she needed in order to do her own research from there: that the word was a slur and deeply offensive. She has the tools to find out if she wanted to know more detail. Or she could have just said \"Oh! I'm so sorry!\" and not used it again. Either way, she had choices that did not involve your holding her hand while she figured it all out.", "NTA You let her know it was offensive and instead of apologizing and moving on she is doubling down.", "You are NTA.\n\nI live in a village from up north and P*ki and Ch*nky are both very commonly used here. An acquaintanc's son was given a detention for calling his friend a ch*nky in school and she was clueless as to why it was offensive, \"it's just the nickname for the Chinese takeaway\". Everyone here is under the impression that P*ki is also just an abbreviation of Pakistani. I've also tried communicating that these are slurs and been told that I'm incorrect.", "NTA. She has the power of Google. Dealing with bigotry is exhausting.", "NTA.\n\nIt is a racist slur.\n\nHer being from a small all-white village makes no difference. If it\u2019s used, it\u2019s used in a derogatory way.", "NTA. Even if she didn\u2019t know it was a slur, she should\u2019ve apologized in the moment and googled to educate herself instead of accusing you of overreacting.\n\nOr even if in the moment she reacted defensively (everyone hates hearing criticism and not everyone handles it well in the moment, though that is not an excuse for shitty behaviour), there was plenty of time afterwards to reflect and apologise. It\u2019s not your responsibility to deal with her issues.", "NTA. You're not obligated to take on labor of educating bigots. You told her not to call you that, if she cared about you as a person she would have said I'm sorry instead of doubling down.", "Definitely NTA. Your friend is clearly a little ignorant and needs educating. Perhaps it's not entirely her fault, since you said she comes from somewhere that mainly consists of white people. But still, it's not your job to educate anyone. You already made her aware that it's a slur. She is more than welcome and more than capable of doing her own research, asking you about it, or just simply never saying it again. I wouldn't want to explain it to her either - I'd personally feel so awkward!", "NTA. Educating someone on these things is *exhausting*. It's emotional labor, and it's something you have to deal with all the time so discussing that topic can be traumatic for some people. Sometimes people don't know something is wrong or offensive! A couple months ago I had the \"don't use spirit animal to refer to kinning or heavily relating to something, that's appropriation and turns indigenous culture into a commodity\" conversation on here. The person who used it apologized immediately and thanks those who let them know. Not everyone can know everything, and it doesn't sound like you were expecting her to. \n\nHow someone *responds* when told what they're saying or doing is harmful is the important part. She said *don't overreact* and claimed it wasn't a slur, despite you, someone of that ethnicity, telling her in was. *That* was out of line and makes her the AH. You're right, she very easily could do her own research, and if she wants to study politics, she should know how to even more so because a large portion of that field is knowing how to properly research sensitive topics and how to separate biased sources from legitimate ones. If your parents want to have that mindset, they can apply it to themselves. But no one is entitled to your emotional labor, especially not when they're downplaying the significance of it", "NTA\n\nIt is not your job to explain all of that to your friends and acquaintances. That would be exhausting. If your friend doesn't believe you when you say that it's an offensive slur, then she's not much of a friend to begin with.", ">Oh I didn\u2019t realise you were a Pi \n\n\n\nDo you mean \u201cP a k i\u201d? (Separating letters in case of a bot that looks for slurs).

Growing up in Canada with no large Spanish communities, I thought nothing of calling my dog Spik because I like calling him weird things. I heard a joke on the internet that alluded to Spik being a slur, googled it, and never called him that again. It\u2019s not that hard.", "NTA I'm not even from Britain and even i know how it's used as a slur", "NTA. I\u2019m a SEA Chinese who studied up north in the UK for uni, and one of my local white friends when we went out for lunch for the first time, asked me if I ate dogs. \n\nThe difference though, is my friend was mortified and apologised profusely after I explained how racist and offensive that question was. And now she\u2019s one of my closest friends, so I still tease her about it years later as is my right.\n\nWhereas Izzy here is doubling down on her ignorance and acting as if she knows better about racism towards your ethnicity and culture than you. Theres no teaching someone who doesn\u2019t want to learn. That makes her the AH here, not you.", "NTA\n\nShe definitely knows it's offensive. \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of Brits feign ignorance/use passive-aggressive comments just to have an opportunity to be racist.", "NTA - unlike many commenters, I am from the UK. You would have to be living under a rock here to not know that this is a slur.\n\nFor context/interest, there are actually many slurs predominantly used in America that I had no idea were slurs until being chronically online and reading a lot.", "So I (20s UK) actually had no idea that was a slur until a bit earlier this year. Honest to god, I genuinely thought it was just an innocent abbreviation for Pakistani (Thank god I never actually used it).\nWhen I heard that it was offensive there was a moment of incredulity, a bit of disbelief, then I went and looked it up and had that \"ohhhh...\" moment.\n\nSo I can get her defensiveness over it, becuase if I had actually been going casually saying it then the \"Oh god I've been doing something horrible without even realising it\" would have been a much harder pill to swallow, and a lot of people don't want to entertain that possibility at all and live in the denial land of \"I haven't been saying an offensive thing, you're just wrong.\"\n\nBut that said, it's entirely her problem and not yours. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure that she doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a slur, but it is theoretically possible not to. That being said, given that the sentence was pretty problematic in and of itself, and that she immediately dismissed your concerns when you pointed it out, I\u2019d be inclined towards thinking that she is aware it\u2019s a pejorative term but doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s not easy to confront your friends, but you were absolutely right to here. It shouldn\u2019t be your job to explain the history of prejudice to your friends", "NTA Tell your lecturer - the one who led the British Raj class, that there are students who have used this term and have an embarrassing knowledge gap that you challenged them on and they rebuffed you. Discrimination that persists today should be included in the next discussion, this is not acceptable. \n\nShe could be sacked if she said this in the workplace, better she learns now.\n\nA friend would have apologised and corrected the terms they use immediately. Sorry some people are still so uninformed. It shouldn\u2019t be your job to convince them that what they said was offensive.", "I was born in the early 90s in a white working class community and as a kid I remember everyone would say \"paki shop\" in reference to the newsagent and \"chinky\" in reference to the chinese takeaway.\n\nThere was never any malice behind it but for the most part people have stopped using these phrases (at least not publicly as especially not in the company of someone of that race) for the best part of 20 years now because they have realised these are slurs.\n\nI find it difficult to believe that someone of university age exists in some little bubble where these terms are still commonplace and no one knows they are offensive.\n\nI can understand someone elderly who is set in their ways but I would expect someone born after these terms were deemed unacceptable to know better.", "Ah, the all-white village. I didn't know those still existed--I grew up in one myself but that was back in mumble mumble. Where I live now is mostly white, admittedly.\n\nShe's perfectly capable of researching this for herself so no you're NTA for not wanting to do the legwork. I think you were already trying to ensure she doesn't use that term to anyone else, but you don't control her, and there's no guarantee that anything you say will convince her anyway.\n\nStill, a Politics student? She could just, yanno, ask her tutor.... If she actually wants not to offend.", "NTA, with a caution.\nIt's conceivable, although far-fetched, that she'd not realized it was an offensive term.\nNo, you're not an asshole for not being in the mood to enlighten your benighted friend, but you're in a good position to do it, possibly without vitriol..", "In my opinion you're not the AH, the friends a right ahole in this. Even so if she somehow wasn't aware of the fact she's using a slur (doesn't justify the word being in her vocabulary though) she didn't even acknowledge the effect of the word. Confronting her on it when she seems oblivious to that. It can be awkward and weird to try and explain something like that to someone and it's understandable that you don't want to, though, you're parents arent wrong though", "NTA. I wasn\u2019t aware it was a slur (I don\u2019t live in the UK) but she doubled down on it. Not even an apology or acknowledge that she did wrong (even unintentionally)", "NTA.  If she's at University then we have to presume that she has the intelligence to look up why using the P-word is offensive.  It's not your job to sit her down and explain everything to her.  I don't buy the \"oh I'm an innocent country bumpkin from a village in the middle of nowhere!\" either - she's, what, twenty years old and she's *never* been told using that word is offensive?  I call bullshit, madam, bullshit.  And good luck with your studies!", "NTA - how on earth is she from the UK and does not realise that's a slur?!", "NTA - and a note to everyone on here not from the UK - here it is exactly like using the N word and then claiming you didn't know it was a slur.", "NTA. And how does she not know what that word means or entails?! Being from the North is no excuse, people in the North are equally aware as the South and she choosing to be ignorant is not on being a Northerner. Tell her to learn about things before blabbing her mouth and then actually defending it!", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't matter if she thinks that it isn't a slur. What matters is that it bothers you. You have told her that you consider it a slur and don't like it's use. That should be enough.", "I have mixed feelings on this because \n\na) as someone who is of Indian descent in the Caribbean there are slurs used towards us and I have had to shut it down from others who thought they were being cool. I didn\u2019t get into it, I just said yeah no you don\u2019t get to use that term because that\u2019s a slur. Did they learn? Maybe but also we are not a common enough group where I live and it\u2019s not a common term so not likely to come up again.\n\nb) where I live \u201ca packie\u201d is a liquor store and have had to explain when someone used the term in conversation where someone if British south Asian descent was that other person (an American) wasn\u2019t aware this was a slur but it\u2019s a slang used for something else. \n\nI always think education is better but it\u2019s also exhausting to have to educate the world and it IS a well known slur even if she lived in a mostly white area. So NTA cause you\u2019re entitled to not have to explain everything to everyone but I do think you need to just explain to this person that \u201cif they can\u2019t understand why what they said is offensive it isn\u2019t your job to have to explain it to her but until she can understand and educate herself you need to take a break from your friendship\u201d", "NTA - there is no chance in hell she didn't know that was offensive. I've loved all over England up north down south and everyone I have met know not to say stupid shit like that.", "She knows why it\u2019s a slur, she just wants to argue her points & make you uncomfortable. A grown woman taking political classes *knows.* NTA", "NTA. I didn't realise it was a slur until I was 12 and saw Bend It Like Beckham. A character in it refers to herself that way when she's ranting about the racist treatment she often receives (immediately followed by a white man minimising her experience because he knows about racism because he's *Irish*, not great). My brain went \"okay, bad word, don't use.\"\n\nYour classmate, and I'm using that word because I don't think she's a good friend at all, is *doubling down* because [checks notes] she's from a small, predominantly white community, who have decided that it's okay. It is *not* your job to educate her, and it is *certainly* not your job to correct someone whose pride is more important than being a bigot.", "NTA. Not your job to educate racists.\n\nI literally gasped when I saw what she'd said.

It has been used as a slur against me and it makes me feel bad.\"\n\nIf your friends can't accept that, which by your account they did not, you can just walk away. You are not required to explain.

As a half (and very white passing) Pakistani girl you better believe that I berated him within an inch of his life.\n\nHowever, it is absolutely not your job or responsibility to take on the emotional burden of explaining how much of an ignorant racist she is.

She's rude", "NTA, I'm late 40s and grew up in the UK with people around me using that word to describe the local corner shop, didn't use it myself as I was taught from very young that it's a disrespectful word. \n\nShe knows what she did, sorry but no way she doesn't, and if she grew up using it and it came out by an old habit, she should've immediately apologised.", "As someone raised in the north - that is no reason to use racial slurs and I\u2019m not convinced that anyone wouldn\u2019t know it was offensive\u2026 maybe if she had a very sheltered upbringing and racist parents. Anyway we do have the internet in the north so not really an excuse. You are very much NTA and it\u2019s not your responsibility to educate rude and wilfully ignorant people, I would avoid her if I were you", "NTA\n\nWe, a bunch of white kids in a predominantly white UK village in the 1980s, knew that word was wrong way back then. I'm willing to believe that she may only have moved in ignorant circles that used the word without further explanation, and she formed the wrong opinion of it.

As soon as you said it was a slur, she should have said \"I'm sorry, I didn't know\" or something like, instead of buckeling down.", "NTA.

I know the use of language changes, and some things are not-favourable to say but they were once.. but this has been a slur for decades.

My dad was born in Northern England, also in a village, where the vast majority of people were also white yet he knew that slur. Everyone in this country knows (even the majority of children) not to use it as it will get them into trouble. Your friend is lying and expected you to just take being called that slur as she thinks you were too meek to defend yourself. You've likely surprised her and instead of admitting her wrongdoing, she is instead doubling down. Get rid of her, you don't need or want a bigot like that in your life.", "Nta.

Not cool.", "As I never heard the slur paki I am on your parents side.

It is not your job to continuously educate these mayosapians", "YTA. I wouldnt call you an AH for this but rather than controlling your temper and explaining to your friend why the word upsets you, you left. \"Do not attribute to malice, that which can be attributed to stupidity.\"\n\nI personally didnt know this was a slur until now. To a majority of people its a shortened version of pakistani. Same way arab is short for arabian. For example, one could say \"I am an arab\" or \"I'm arabian\". \n\nI believe context and tone matter just as much. The english used paki as short for pakistani. The problem was what they were doing and how it was said. You can make anything an insult by saying it with disqust or aggression. Arab, brit, swede, jew, scots, serbs, swiss, turks. None of these are slurs, yet if im beating someone calling them a f**king [demonym] , it will definetly seem like a slur. \n\nPeople just like shortening words.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was raised up North in a village where everyone is white (although she admits that she went to school and college in the nearby cities so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s never encountered someone from an ethnic minority before.)\n\nI\u2019m from a South Asian background and I\u2019m a practicing Muslim so I wear hijab. We were talking about the politics of the Partition and Izzy asked why I seemed so passionate about the topic so I said \u201cwell because that\u2019s where my family is from!\u201d\n\nAnd then she said \u201cOh I didn\u2019t realise you were a *P**i* I thought you were Arabic!\u201d\n\nThere are so many things wrong with that sentence. But well. I have had that same P word weaponised against me and members of my family suffered violence specifically because of our heritage by people using that word.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe she would use it and I told her \u201cDon\u2019t ever use that slur again!\u201d\n\nShe started saying\u201dHow is that offensive? That\u2019s not a slur don\u2019t overreact!\u201d\n\nI left the study group and I haven\u2019t directly spoken to her since. She text me to say I\u2019m being ridiculous and how is it even a slur so I told her that if she\u2019s studying Politics she should know how or at least figure out how to look it up.\n\nWhen I mentioned it to my parents they said that i should have sat and explained the history to her and that I have a responsibility to make sure she doesn\u2019t use it to anyone else\n\nDoes not wanting to do that make me the AH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "This office episode was in 2001 and it\u2019s shown as offensive \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cir05JyEsV0", "Responsibility? For who? Someone who offended you and didn't even *think* that she was in the wrong and called you ridiculous with literally no knowledge about it?\n\nIt didn't even come to her mind that she might have said something wrong when you fucking got up and left, and that maybe, and I say, *maybe* you know more than her so she doesn't really have the right to call you ridiculous?\n\nNTA She better start looking things up.\n\nEdit: I myself have not much knowledge about that term. But if it is so offending then I'm either *politely* asking if *I can* ask you to explain and if you don't want to I'll look it up. Seeing someone being offended over something they clearly know better than me and calling them ridiculous is one of the most AH moves I've seen here.", "NTA. Even if she genuinely didn't know, she could look it up on urbandictionary or something. I think what really made her an AH was the doubling down after you said it was offensive, even trying to make out that you were the one at fault by being \"ridiculous\". No. She's ridiculous. And it's not your job to explain how and why a slur is hurtful, particularly when we live in an age where this information is easily accessible.", "NTA \n\n\nHasan Minhaj has a comedy special Homecoming king that talks about a lot of things but one thing in particular is the difference between him and his parents in how they respond to racism. I am paraphrasing here but basically like your parents, his were just thankful to be in the country and were willing to educate others as a survival skill while he was a second generation in the new country and he demanded more from people around him. \n\n\nIt's just a difference in generations and experiences but maybe watching this comedy special alone or with your parents would help you understand each others' views.\n\n\nBut you are definitely NTA and I am sorry your friend was hurtful and unwilling to to the work of educating herself.", "My hometown is mostly white and I have to have these conversations again and again and again with my own family. I'm really sorry for your experiences and it shouldn't be down to you to explain. It would take her a minute tops to Google why after you let her know the first time that what she said was not ok, and it's 2023 - think it'd be pretty obvious that if a person from a specific group says a term a person not from that group uses about them is offensive, then it is in fact offensive.\n\nNTA at all, no way", "The way she reacted, she doesn't care that it's a slur. Now if someone was genuinely confused and didn't know, that's another story.\n\nI'd stay far far away from her", "NTA you don't owe anyone free education.  She genuinely might not have realised it was a slur but she should have apologized, explained she didn't know and then looked into herself.", "NTA. Not your job to educate her.", "NTA. That term has been recognised as a slur for very many years. It's extremely unlikely that's she's never been aware of the overtly racist and aggressive way its used in the UK, but even if there is an outside chance that she genuinely didn't know its a slur, her response was unacceptable. If you're told \"don't say that word again to me, its offensive,' the response is 'I'm sorry' not 'you're over-reacting.' \n\nIn the 1970s, there were some horrible TV shows on UK TV where racist terms were freely used (s a m b o, c o o n, w o g etc) and it was supposed to be comedic. The P word was well established as a slur by then too, so that's 50 years where these horrible words have been recognised as racist and offensive. I can't believe she's never been made aware of it, even if she did live in an all-white area.", "NTA. \nI heard of this word for one of the first times a few days ago, and ngl I thought it was short for people from Pakistan, so there is a possibility that the girl didn\u2019t know it was a slur. Regardless of that, when someone tells you that X thing is a slur/offensive, LISTEN. She became the AH when she tried to justify it.", "NTA. She may not have known it's a slur, that is absolutely possible. But she knew what she said had upset you and you told her it was a slur - why on earth she'd dismiss what you said is beyond me. Even then, she could easily have googled this after your conversation and see that what you told her was correct - and she could then apologise to you. She is choosing not to do this.", "NTA and thats coming from someone who's made similar blunders to this girl after growing up in a place where some racial slurs are just every day vocab. If someone tells me a word is offensive to them, I don't need them to give me an essay on why, I apologize for using it, explain I didn't know it was offensive and will be mindful of that in the future and act on it. If I truly have doubts I either ask someone who I know wants to explain or look it up myself.", "On the whole NTA, but the p-word was very commonly used without particular negative connotations (the Pakistani ambassador's car had and possibly still has registration number \"PAK 1\") so it's quite possible that your friend simply didn't know that its's now offensive. Jumping down her throat for a first offence might have been a bit OTT, but her denial was a lot worse.", "NTA - she is clearly a shallow person.", "Nta. \n\nAsk her how she would feel of you referred to her as a cute country bumpkin or yokel since you thought she was just a simple villager.", "NTA. First - she can definitely find out why it is a slur if she actually cared to. I am from America and have known for at least 20 years that this is a slur, even if it is not used here. Second - your parents opinion, while understandable, is unreasonable. All the work of educating others on the issues of marginalized people should not sit entirely on the shoulders of such people.  You already bear the burden of discrimination and worse - why should you also carry the burden of having to explain it all in traumatic detail to others. Yes, first hand accounts are very powerful, but should not be some kind of expectation. Kudos to you for standing up for yourself and saying something at all - because it is very hard to do.", "NTA: it\u2019s not your responsibility to educate her.", "NTA I was born and educated in a small ex-mining town in the north of England. There was only one Asian lad in the entire school (in my form group no less, Bilal was ace) and there wasn\u2019t a single Black student until I was in 6th form. I wouldn\u2019t have dreamt of using that word then or now. Ignorance is not an excuse for racism and ignorance does not mean that she is entitled to be spoon fed common sense about a very sensitive topic. As other commenters have said, the emotional labour to educate your friend is not your responsibility, it is her job to educate herself. And the fact that she doubled down after you said how distressing that word is shows how immature she really is. I would seriously reevaluate this \u2018friendship\u2019.", "NTA\n\nI'm from NE England and when I grew up, this word was tossed around by everyone I knew as a way to describe things and people from Pakistan (I like to think my family weren't using it to be offensive) and I always thought it was just an abbreviation of Pakistani like Brit is an abbreviation of British etc etc \n\nAs I got older and wiser, I learned that the word had been weaponized as a way to insult and imply people were less then by others so it didn't matter if I personally didn't use it that way, it was still highly offensive and racist to many many people. Guess what I did? Never used the word again. \n\nIf this girl is used to hearing the word, she could have the same misconceptions I had when I was much younger but it's still not your job to explain things to her. A simple Google search will tell her that the word is considered extremely offensive", "NTA. She\u2019s either lived in Royston Vasey or she\u2019s a closet racist. Either I\u2019d stay away as she\u2019s clearly not your friend.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ll admit it. I live in the middle of farms in the US and have never seen or heard the word before. It took me all of 20 seconds to look it up. Ten different sources immediately popped up it was a British slur. She lives there she should know.", "NTA. If someone from any ethnic group tells you something is offensive, you believe then and stop saying it. You don\u2019t double down and say it\u2019s not", "I'm from the UK, this is definitely a slur and she knew it. Not sure how someone could of got to her age unaware that word was offensive!! \n\nNTA.", "Omg I've had a convo like this!

I'm sure shell grow outta it but if shes sted fast on it for now I doubt itll chance soon, sorry some of us are so dence! ( white uk here)", "NTA.\n\nYou are studying in Uni by now she should have discovered Google. She is begin obtuse, distance yourself from her and to anyone that is ready to use slur. In this context ignorance is totally a choice.", "NTA - I was born in the UK in the 70\u2019s and I\u2019ve known it was a slur since I can remember. It is not your job to educate her, she\u2019s an adult she can look it up herself.", "I'm in the north of England,  and while I know that word is a slur, I've noticed a few people around here use it without realizing it. I've corrected it when possible.  That being said,  NTA. If a person uses a slur and is corrected they should be apologetic at least.", "I know that people from smaller towns and villages may have had less direct contact with people from ethnic minorities, but they do have television and the internet.\n\nThat has been recognised as a slur for decades. There is no excuse for thinking it is OK.  The fact that she used the expression at all suggests that it is normal in her family. It isn't normal or OK, you've told her that,  and it's up to her to fix this and educate herself if necessary.\n\nNTA", "NTA - if she didn\u2019t know that was a slur then she\u2019s lived under a rock or in isolation for her whole life.

Precisely how does one manage to reach the age of 20 in the UK and not know \"Paki\" is a slur? You're not obligated to be the good \"minority\" and teach her the error of her ways. (And to be fair to your parents, there was a time when no one else would, so it fell to the people being marginalized or such education wouldn't get done, so I understand where they're coming from on that point.)", "NTA  I've personally never heard the word before but if someone told me I'd just used a slur against them, I'd be mortified and apologizing profusely.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a middle aged white woman living in New York State. I audibly gasped when you said what she said because even my sheltered American rear end knows that is considered a slur in England/UK. To be fair, I didn\u2019t know that until an episode of Doctor Who taught me but if a dumb American knows not to say it then she has literally no excuse.", "Call her colonizer and see how quickly her tune  changes.

Just because someone is ignorant it doesn\u2019t let them off the hook.", "NTA in general cause it *is* stressful but hear me out: you're going to university. Part of your future will likely include explaining stuff to people. Why we do this, why we don't do that and so on. You can turn that person into an understanding ally or you don't. Disregarding the rest of the situation we don't know, I would suggest adding an ally is always worth a try. Even if it annoys you.", "~~YTA~~ \\- firstly grow some thic skinn, dont get offended so easily. You act like she said \"you are fckng p\\*\\*i. Not like the real thing where she used the word unknowingly.Secondly, how is it hers task to learn about some totally foreign slurrs? You just choose to be offended, and stuck up with that without even explaining.  \nedit:**NAH**, it was not clear its generally known slurr, yet I would give bennefit of the doubt to the girl who used the bad word. Ppl on universities are really not experienced with life at all and comming there from theyr own echochambers where they dont know a lot of things. Yet quick response in style of \"you call me p\\*ki so i call c\\*nt\" could be enough explanation how the word is felt by you. And her reaction could use some tact too. I am not talking any sjw stuff here, but decent human interaction instead of being so deffensive. She could say \"sorry\" and move on.", "Paki is not a slur lol.\n\nEdit: don't bother replying, seems like OP blocked me so I will not be able to reply to any of you lmao.", "N A H\n\nI have never heard the word Pi besides the one related to the number.\n\nActually I can't even find anything about it on Google, any hints on what I should look for?\n\nEdit: After further clarification about the word and looking it up it indeed seems to be a known slur so I change my judgment to NTA.", "Literally not racist.

I don\u2019t believe that there are just these undercover racists going around befriending their classmates just for the sake of waiting for that one perfect opportunity to call them a racist name in a conversation that just so happens to be about heritage/race knowing full well this information will get around an \u2018out\u2019 then for the racist they are. She is ignorant, which isn\u2019t the same as stupid or racist. If you need a definition\u2014 YOU can google it. I don\u2019t think ignorance is a reason to completely ostracize a person. Your parents have a point, to a certain extent, you are only furthering the divide between people by taking such extreme measures with your actions. \n\nBut on the other hand, no you don\u2019t owe her an explanation. You can tell her it is a hateful word and that she shouldn\u2019t use it. It is then her responsibility to find out why. Text her and tell her to find out why. Maybe then you two can come back together and have a grown up conversation, and she can have a chance to apologize rather than both of you just holding resentment.
