But also E S H for thinking that there needs to be blame at all especially if your wife also believes someone is to be blamed. Why does someone need to be blamed? What backwards, past oriented thinking is ever helpful? The only thing to do is learn from the past with a future orientation. So:\n\n1) establish if you wish to keep 4 hour old pancakes. You can agree to disagree here. If you don't want to keep them but your wife does, then the pancakes are kept with the understanding that you will not be eating them.\n2) you now are more aware to check the oven when you preheat as you are aware that your wife may have put things in there to keep. You may remember, you may not... So...\n3) your wife can be more diligent in informing you that there are pancakes there by putting a note on the oven if things are in there.\n\nIt's as simple as a) pancakes are burnt b) these were meant to be kept unburnt and consumed by someone in the house (possibly) c) either you or your wife can make a request for better communication or action in the future to prevent a similar incident.\n\nStop being E S H by trying to assign blame.

It's standard safety/sanity protocol to check an oven before you turn it on. There could be food in there, as happened here. There might be a spill that wasn't visible until it dried. A child might have put something weird in there, because kids are weird. Teens/children who do dishes sometimes randomly hide them in there. Any one of hundreds of issues. Always, always check.\n\nIt's okay. If no one told you, and you've never had a problem, you had no way to know. Now you have, and you do. \n\nIt was a natural assumption for your wife to make... that you'd know.\n\nAs for your questions:\n\n1) Pancakes are bread. They're absolutely edible after 4 hours.

(Yes, there are meringue recipes that call for turning off the oven and leaving the meringues in over night, but if I (the only baker in the house) did that, I\u2019d put a post-it on the oven telling people not to turn it on.) But in normal, day-to-day existence, the only reason I open the oven before I preheat it is if I need to move an oven rack. If the oven is off, there shouldn\u2019t be anything in it, but the oven racks.\n\nThe part your wife is conveniently leaving out in her hurry to blame you for not checking the oven is that *she forgot to take the pancakes out of the oven.* She messed up. It\u2019s a small and understandable mistake in the morning rush. All it did was waste a few pancakes. But if two of you are busy apportioning responsibility, she needs to own up to her part in this tempest in a tea pot. How do I know she forgot to take the pancakes out?\n\nShe made school morning pancakes.\n\nShe put the extras in the turned off oven *to keep warm* in case the kids wanted more. Not to store them for an after school snack or for the next day\u2019s breakfast. *To keep warm.* Ovens that have been turned off cool down. This happens pretty quickly in an oven that\u2019s only been at 200.\n\nThe kids went to school, presumably not a surprise to her.\n\nThere is no way she thought the oven and those pancakes were still going to be warm when the kids got home from school, even if they had a half day.\n\nObviously, her plan was to either toss the pancakes or store them some place appropriate if the kids didn\u2019t want more, but she forgot they were in there and she went to work or whatever.", "I mean, this is a petty fight more about cultures/customs almost, but in my house, YTA.
