What backwards, past oriented thinking is ever helpful? The only thing to do is learn from the past with a future orientation. So:\n\n1) establish if you wish to keep 4 hour old pancakes. You can agree to disagree here. If you don't want to keep them but your wife does, then the pancakes are kept with the understanding that you will not be eating them.\n2) you now are more aware to check the oven when you preheat as you are aware that your wife may have put things in there to keep. You may remember, you may not... So...\n3) your wife can be more diligent in informing you that there are pancakes there by putting a note on the oven if things are in there.\n\nIt's as simple as a) pancakes are burnt b) these were meant to be kept unburnt and consumed by someone in the house (possibly) c) either you or your wife can make a request for better communication or action in the future to prevent a similar incident.\n\nStop being E S H by trying to assign blame.

It's standard safety/sanity protocol to check an oven before you turn it on. There could be food in there, as happened here. There might be a spill that wasn't visible until it dried. A child might have put something weird in there, because kids are weird. Teens/children who do dishes sometimes randomly hide them in there. Any one of hundreds of issues. Always, always check.\n\nIt's okay. If no one told you, and you've never had a problem, you had no way to know. Now you have, and you do. \n\nIt was a natural assumption for your wife to make... that you'd know.\n\nAs for your questions:\n\n1) Pancakes are bread. They're absolutely edible after 4 hours.

(Yes, there are meringue recipes that call for turning off the oven and leaving the meringues in over night, but if I (the only baker in the house) did that, I\u2019d put a post-it on the oven telling people not to turn it on.) But in normal, day-to-day existence, the only reason I open the oven before I preheat it is if I need to move an oven rack. If the oven is off, there shouldn\u2019t be anything in it, but the oven racks.\n\nThe part your wife is conveniently leaving out in her hurry to blame you for not checking the oven is that *she forgot to take the pancakes out of the oven.* She messed up. It\u2019s a small and understandable mistake in the morning rush. All it did was waste a few pancakes. But if two of you are busy apportioning responsibility, she needs to own up to her part in this tempest in a tea pot. How do I know she forgot to take the pancakes out?\n\nShe made school morning pancakes.\n\nShe put the extras in the turned off oven *to keep warm* in case the kids wanted more. Not to store them for an after school snack or for the next day\u2019s breakfast. *To keep warm.* Ovens that have been turned off cool down. This happens pretty quickly in an oven that\u2019s only been at 200.\n\nThe kids went to school, presumably not a surprise to her.\n\nThere is no way she thought the oven and those pancakes were still going to be warm when the kids got home from school, even if they had a half day.\n\nObviously, her plan was to either toss the pancakes or store them some place appropriate if the kids didn\u2019t want more, but she forgot they were in there and she went to work or whatever.", "I mean, this is a petty fight more about cultures/customs almost, but in my house, YTA.

I could never forgive myself if that happened to one of mine.", "Cast-iron skillets are oven safe, so this doesn't seem necessary as a safety precaution, just as a convenience one.", "Until you realize you have to take these now very hot skillets out and set them aside in a super tiny kitchen so you can put your food in. That was a hassle I learned to avoid very quickly.", "While true, they are really no fun to take out after you preheat the oven to 350 to 400 F.", "I had a fit of giggles after reading this one!", "Yes you can eat them, no you should not.\n\nNTA, and when someone in our house leaves something in the oven, we put a little note card that say \"Check Oven\" on the front of the oven with a magnet.\n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nAlways check the oven! You\u2019re the one who turned it on, you must check if there is not \u201cdanger\u201d to burn something or put it on fire. You\u2019re responsible.\n\nAnd yes, they would be edible. Don\u2019t try to put blame on your wife.", "As someone who works in the food industry: NO! do not eat those pancakes\n\n\nI'm gonna say NAH just bc it's two different ways of doing things. The fault more so lies with her bc she didn't tell anyone what she did nor put it away herself.", "YTA. It\u2019s an adult rule to always check the oven before you pre-heat it. You clearly don\u2019t do the cooking, so check the oven.", "NAH. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve preheated the oven only to find a pizza box or cast iron skillet in there lol", "Both are at fault. \n\nLook in the oven before starting it. Thats standard safety procedure you could say.\n\nDont store food in the oven. She forgot about it so she cant throw blame.\n\nUnderstand that you both are airheads and move on.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, but I\u2019ve been in your shoes.. preheated the oven once and unbeknownst someone left pizza in there.. smoke central! Haha, so now every time before I use the oven I ALWAYS check to make sure it\u2019s empty, it seems people like to use it to store things more than we think.. so better safe than sorry. And also, I\u2019m sure pancakes were fine after 4 hours", "ESH. It\u2019s a couple burnt leftover pancakes, who cares..", "The real loser here is the pancakes? What did they ever do to you?", "Hmm I might be unpopular but NTA\n1. I never check the oven because if I put something in there to keep warm input it away myself\n2. I have child locks on my oven door and the knobs for the gas so nothing goes in that I don\u2019t know about.", "JFC, the breakdown of blame is the most bizarre thing I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s fucking pancakes. Clean up, move on. \n\nESH for making an issue out of a non-issue", "NTA, anyone could've made this mistake.  It is, however, a mistake and it cost you some nice pancakes.\n\nYes, the pancakes would still be edible\n\nYes, unless you live alone, and especially if you live with children, you must always check the oven, the washer, the dryer, and the dishwasher before turning them on.", "Maybe it's just a my family is weird thing but I always check any oven before turnin it on. My great-Mamaw and Mamaw stored their cast iron in their ovens. It's where I store mine.", "You haven't used your oven to keep things warm? It's why better ovens can go as low as 70c.", "Another answer is anyone who uses the oven as storage, like me.", "My mum has a bad habit of storing the chip pan in the oven.\n\nI ALWAYS check what's in the oven.", "And that\u2019s enough Reddit for tonight \ud83d\ude2d", "I always check my dryer, washer, and fridge incase one of mine got curious. I guess I'm adding oven to that list.", "I don't let my cats in the laundry room, so hopefully they never get in the washer or dryer. I'm constantly pulling them out of the fridge though. Dishwasher too."]}
