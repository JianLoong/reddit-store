They\u2019re shit\u2019s not hotter than anyone else\u2019s.\n\nEdit: I just need to talk about Leslie for a minute. She has some really backwards thinking. This is the 21st century. This is the era of female CEOs. I\u2019m not saying that the rule, and they are certainly more commonly the exception in the rule. But to simply write off women when women obviously make 50% of the workforce is a problem. Like wait until she sees a woman she\u2019s basically ignored actually get in a REAL position of power that\u2019s not through her own marriage. Not to discredit you, but your marriage to a VP is not the kind of power I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m taking her manager level power. She\u2019s going to be in for a really rude awakening when women all around her or excelling and she\u2019s not because she played mean because she saw the women as useless.\n\nBut in general, I don\u2019t think even in a workplace you should use a relationship that transactionally. \n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s really gross that you work with people who never noticed an engagement ring on your finger or even asked you about your personal life. I just really bad camaraderie creation. Their entire team atmospheres really horrible. They\u2019re probably going to get the book thrown for their cliquish behavior. It\u2019s not conducive to healthy work relationships or productivity overall. I don\u2019t not saying that you have to grab and do each other\u2019s hair over the weekend. But they\u2019re being here with straight hostile", "NTA. Its time to CYA.  Write everything they have ever said and keep it on your personal computer at home.

They will try to bait an argument / disagreement. But don\u2019t let them.\n\nAnd maybe ask Jerry to pick up lunch for you next time lol?", "Nta. They sound like bad people so who cares about them.", "NTA. They only care because they want to cover their own asses.

They're overreacting because of a last name change and its kind of funny.", "God this hole thing, from how you describe your coworkers and how they react. Is exactly why people like me want remote work. The less I have to even deal with this petty high school bull shit the better. Every one is an AH", "NTA.
