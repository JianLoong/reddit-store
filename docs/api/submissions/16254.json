They should have been more interested in how you two actually met and cute stories.\n\nThey live with a very cynical and almost predatory view of world if they think you\u2019re going to use your marriage to get them fired. \n\nI\u2019d doubt Mike is dumb and their snarky remakes have probably gotten back to him via other routes. No matter how big your office is, there\u2019s small town/group gossip enough to get around\n\nThey also need reality check. They\u2019re shit\u2019s not hotter than anyone else\u2019s.\n\nEdit: I just need to talk about Leslie for a minute. She has some really backwards thinking. This is the 21st century. This is the era of female CEOs. I\u2019m not saying that the rule, and they are certainly more commonly the exception in the rule. But to simply write off women when women obviously make 50% of the workforce is a problem. Like wait until she sees a woman she\u2019s basically ignored actually get in a REAL position of power that\u2019s not through her own marriage. Not to discredit you, but your marriage to a VP is not the kind of power I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m taking her manager level power. She\u2019s going to be in for a really rude awakening when women all around her or excelling and she\u2019s not because she played mean because she saw the women as useless.\n\nBut in general, I don\u2019t think even in a workplace you should use a relationship that transactionally. \n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s really gross that you work with people who never noticed an engagement ring on your finger or even asked you about your personal life. I just really bad camaraderie creation. Their entire team atmospheres really horrible. They\u2019re probably going to get the book thrown for their cliquish behavior. It\u2019s not conducive to healthy work relationships or productivity overall. I don\u2019t not saying that you have to grab and do each other\u2019s hair over the weekend. But they\u2019re being here with straight hostile", "NTA. Its time to CYA.  Write everything they have ever said and keep it on your personal computer at home.  When they attempt to get you fired use it as your trump card.  Also hint to HR about the innappropriate relationship between ben and leslie.", "Lolololol this is gold. NTA at all.\n\nOf course you never should have told them bc what if you broke up, etc? And then things would have been awkward. \n\nYou aren\u2019t even close enough for them to ask about the ring.\n\nJust don\u2019t sink to their level. They will try to bait an argument / disagreement. But don\u2019t let them.\n\nAnd maybe ask Jerry to pick up lunch for you next time lol?", "Nta. They sound like bad people so who cares about them.", "NTA. They only care because they want to cover their own asses. Not to mention, you literally arent saying anything to anyone, and you're not getting anyone fired. They're overreacting because of a last name change and its kind of funny.", "God this hole thing, from how you describe your coworkers and how they react. Is exactly why people like me want remote work. The less I have to even deal with this petty high school bull shit the better. Every one is an AH", "NTA. Heheh, I love that they're now afeared of retaliation - because that's them projecting what they would do if they were you.

Ugh, office politics.  I'm so glad I work from home.", "Truth be told I have never paid any attention to what people have on their fingers. I would never notice it it all unless the person excitedly showed me a ring they received.", "Your NTA huni, they are just scared because they know what they have said in the past is impolite and think that the fact that they have failed to get to know you is about to bite them in the a$$ because they are so self centered that they believe they are so important to you that you have nothing better to discuss wuth your new hubbby, then what they say and do at work.", "There any real difference? I thought she didn\u2019t even want to interact with you to begin with. \n\nGuess she has good reason now to not communicate with you? But she\u2019s at least thinking around career if she doesn\u2019t say nice with others", "I might have another chat with Jerry (as he's the one that approached you) and make it clear that none of them are important enough to be tattled on anyway.", "Or pretend to make extensive notes every time they talk to you.", "Definetly NTA. Congratulations! Maybe they learned a lesson.", "Save that for when he starts with \"meetings that could have been emails.\" ;)", "I do some of my best work in those meetings. Usually it's petting my pups on my WFH days.", "Of course not, he's busy making PowerPoint for his boss", "I laughed out loud. This boss regularly presents my decks to the CEO as his own work, which would be fine if he actually took a minute to understand the decks or even just listened when I presented them. As it is, he repeatedly makes himself look bad.", "His boss isn't paying attention tho", "Was going to suggest slipping in a bullet point somewhere in the middle saying \u201cpresentation (c) matchy_blacks\u201d, but if he\u2019s delivering it badly, that might not be helpful."]}
