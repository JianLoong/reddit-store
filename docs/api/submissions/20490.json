A classic example of \"don't dish it out if you can't take it.\" I hate the stereotype that men shouldn't care about their appearance and be gruff dumb cavemen.

Cleanliness, clean clothes, and a clean appearance meant a lot to them, contrary to the common belief of the dumb warrior in filthy rags. It's also been speculated that many of the viking men were pretty androgynous, aka feminine looking, not that it dampened their general good looks.
