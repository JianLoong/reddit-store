Apologize to nephew, be a good uncle for him and make sure his dad doesn't corrupt him.", "Why did your sister not tone it down all night, when he kept making fun of you? She jumped in when you sent it right back at him. \n\nMy only criticism is that this occurred in front of a child. BF is a terrible roll model, treating you like that in front of his child, and I\u2019m sorry the kid had to see his father taken down a peg. \n\nBF, sister, and father were all AHs to you, I\u2019m sorry to say. That has to be met with firmness. \n\nNone of them should be invited to watch you play unless you\u2019re treated with respect. Since you are a minor, there is not a lot you can do now, but when you turn 18, respectful behavior is a prerequisite to seeing you. \n\nOn a side note, caring about your appearance does help you become more successful. It helps to know how to dress and present yourself in a variety of situations, including job interviews, instead of just rolling out of bed, looking disheveled, and wondering why you\u2019re not taken seriously. That said, I also think you should turn some of your focus outward. You need a path, a meaning in your life. Making money isn\u2019t it, because then what? Plenty of rich people burn out because they still aren\u2019t happy. I suggest you start spending time every week helping others. Tutor a younger kid. Teach a fatherless young kid how to play basketball. Run errands for an elderly neighbor. You\u2019ll start feeling good helping others, and the insecurity of sis\u2019s bf will become even more insignificant.", "NTA, your outfit sounds dope as fuck", "NTA - I can't believe a grown man is making fun of a 16 year old. It seems that he is intimidated by you. As you said, you held it in for years, and maybe were a bit much in front of his kid, but as the saying goes, play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "OP whether you are gay or not, I\u2019m more worried that your sister\u2019s boyfriend is talking about your sexuality and sexual stuff to you when you\u2019re 16. \n\nWatch out for him. He is giving \ud83d\udea9 \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You got it going on, and I approve.", "NTA\n\nAnd who the does he think he is. Talking down to you, speaking ill of you, mockingly and openly questioning your sexual orientation. \nYour sister really did lower her standards. And she deserves to know it for letting him speak to you in that way. \n\nAt 16 family is everything. But they might be lovely sometimes OP, but you are gonna love getting away for that nest and realising how many other amazing people we can spend our lives with instead.", "NTA! Sorry you\u2019re being bullied by grown adults, that\u2019s pathetic. You only said the truth and even if it was rude of you to say (it\u2019s not, it\u2019s an even retaliation) I think it\u2019s important you called out this homophobia and bullying in front of their child because\u2026 what if they grow up and feel like they can\u2019t ever express themselves?", "You can smell the asshole in this one a mile away.", "NTA, it\u2019s usually DL zesty dudes tryna clock ppl. Women will appreciate your cleanliness", "NTA - The bf sucks and we love a fresh, clean king. Keep doing you and hopefully your sister comes to her senses. \n\nSeriously. A grown man making mean, homophobic comments because you take pride in your appearance..", "People always be dishing out what they can't take. NTA\n\nSide note - I've noticed the shorter shorts are back in style. They probably are more practical. Looking back at my photos will probably make most kids wonder how we could do between the legs crossovers without losing the ball", "NTA.   Anytime a grown ass adult goes out of his way to pick on a literal child (you speak well and seem more mature than the adult in question, but developmentally and legally you are not an adult) then that adult is absolutely the asshole.  You're doing just fine, my young friend.  You keep on being you.  Only deeply insecure people go out of their way to drag others down, and only the worst of those insecure people go after 'easy targets' (children, disabled people, vulnerable people.) It's punching down, and it ain't cool, and your sister should be embarrassed by his behavior.", "As a girl, I think it\u2019s awesome you take care of yourself that way! I think anyone, no matter the gender, should invest in self-care, I have no clue why most men are so sensitive about it, but good for you!!\n\nAlso, definitely NTA.", "Lol", "NTA", "To be called gay by someone who most likely doesn't even wipe properly or wash their ass... As if gay is a bad thing, to boot. I'd rather be gay then not take care of myself. I'd start responding with \"if being gay means I shower and wipe my ass then I guess I'm gay.\" NTA.", "Agreed. Nephew needs to see someone push back on the homophobic bullying so NTA there either.", "No need to apologize to the nephew.  He saw dad being a bully.  Dad was wrong.  He saw a bully put in place.  Too bad for bully.  He saw you stand up for yourself against a bully.  Good for him to see.  \nI don\u2019t think explaining to a 10yo that his dad is the bully and it does not reflect on the nephew.  Let\u2019s get real here.  Dad has been badmouthing you to nephew since.

Do your nephew a solid and spend time with him when you can - maybe invite him over to hoop with you, go to a movie, just hang out so that he can also experience what it is like to be around a nice person as opposed to the bully his mother is dating.", "You sound dapper af.  Love it when I see dudes who obviously take pride in their appearance, be it skaters, hoopers, farm boys with crisp cowboy hats, hip-hop kids, guys with the latest sneakers who bleach and clean them daily, etc... When y'all take pride in your appearance it really shows!\n\nThe guys that hate are just deep down jelly that you're showing them up by simply loving yourself.  They probably don't have that same love for themselves, and it's kinda pitiful.", "NTA and \"always smells like he just took a shit\" had me rolling lmao", "Oh he definitely waited til they got home to blubber to your sister if she misses her exes and if she thinks he\u2019s a downgrade lol", "Sounds like you actually told a fact for her then.
