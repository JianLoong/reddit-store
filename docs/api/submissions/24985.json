Oh, and they do large IV infusions, over a number of days, for many hours each day - to attempt to reset the body's pain alarm system from screaming increasingly loudly (i.e. increasingly painfully) and without ceasing, to hopefully put an end to certain types of the worst chronic pain disorders. They can also put the patient into a coma, and make the dosage even more radically extreme. This is a relatively new treatment, just barely beginning around 2010. But, as a few patients died unnecessarily from the coma version - the still highly intense, but slightly less dangerous multiple day version is much more popular, lol.", "I'm going to say this is a soft ESH.

Also, ignore the people saying YTA because of the nickname being an illegal substance. I think the nickname is adorable, and honestly, if anything comes to mind other than it being a sweet nickname, it's the cereal brand special k haha. \nHowever, the reason I say a soft ESH, is because in the end your sister is the parent, and you should try to respect her wishes. \nThat said, I think there's something more going on here as to why your sister doesn't want you to use the nickname. Idk if she's jealous you have something special with her daughter or not, but if she really won't have any sort of adult conversation with you about it, I would suggest talking to your mom. Ask her what her opinion is, and see if she would be willing to sort of mediate a convo between you and your sister about this. \nIn the meantime, maybe you can try talking to your niece, and when she gets upset if you won't call her special k, try gently explaining to her (in an age appropriate manner) that her mom doesn't like it when you use that nickname, so you are trying to be respectful of that. You can also just try whispering it to her occasionally (like if you're saying goodnight to her, when you're giving her a hug, just quietly whisper 'goodnight special k' in her ear), that way she doesn't feel like she's been left out or like you don't care about her anymore, but then you're also not using it all the time and flaunting it in front of her mom. \nBut really you guys just need to have a civil, adult conversation about this.", "YTA. people saying you're are not really don't know that the street name for ketamine is special K?

Which was a popular party drug in the 90s in my city. \n\nSo take too much ketamine and you often became Special K from the Special K.\n\nI moved to a place where people can afford the cereal and do fancy fad diet stuff and then it was shorthand for highly strung anorexics.

So yes a nickname would 100% be necessary at some point. The mom created a problem and doesn't want there to be a quick easy solution. If I were OP I would say as much. They have the same name. They need a way to handle that in normal conversation. It's actually very common.", "\u2026she\u2019s not blocking anything. \n\nThe kid isn\u2019t distraught by the name no longer being used. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to not want a certain nickname used for your kid.", "When you use the same name as your close family member like your half sister it's weird.

At least not anyone under 25.", "And? Just because OP didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what it is doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t that way. How hard is it to just pick a different nickname?", "How is mom treating the kid like property? If that's the case, so would OP. OP is deciding that their nickname is more important than mom's name. That's not how life works. I have seen the argument how the child is 5 and can decide for themselves. But that's not a good argument either. The child is *five*! Does any 5yo get to make important life decisions? No. Does any 5to get to override their parents? No. Parents, honestly, get to make the choice on when their child is old enough to start making certain decisions on their own. How many parents style and cut their kids' hair the way they want/choose when kids are 5? All of them. Why? Because every 5yo would be a nest of tangled, matted deadlocked hair. That's why. OP's niece does not understand why they are called \"Special K\". It is *not* because she and OP have a special bond, like she thinks. OP has already lied to her by letting her believe that. She had that nickname *only* because OP *refused* to call her by her name. Because OP didn't want to. Well OP *is* old enough to understand what these choices are about. And she knows exactly what her sister wanted and *chose* to disrespect her sister and overrule her decision as a parent because she felt like it. Whatever her reasons, sister politely asked her to stop and explained why. That's all she needed to do. And OP would not be lying to her niece about them still sharing a bond and that she can call the niece by her real name to signify it. But she can spare her sister's relationship with her niece by not mentioning the request of a parent. Not because it's \"lying\", as you say, but because kids don't need to know adult conversations and speaking what is perceived as ill or badly of a parent is harmful to a child.\n\nI can see OP's side of things. When I had my kid, I didn't name them until after I held them. As soon as I named them, I already had a shortened version I wanted to use in my mind. But my mom and sister immediately began calling them by a different shorthand version. (Not the name, but think of the name Elizabeth and I wanted to use Eliza, but my mom and sister started calling them Beth.) Within minutes, I loved their choice of shorthand name because of the uniqueness and my extended family even gave my little one a nickname based on what that shorthand meant in Japanese. My kid is 15 now, and I still use that nickname every once in a while when I text them \"I love you\". However, since the day they were born, their dad wasn't been involved (until about 4 years ago, when he would visit up here or drive them down to his 2-3x a year, for a total of 3 weeks). We were good friends before having a baby, but assholes be assholes. I have never kept him away and he was free to see them anytime he wanted to. But I was in touch with his family, both of his parents in particular. We would fly across the country 2x a year to see his mom for a week and talk on the phone. And his dad and stepmom and stepsister took them for a visit to their house for a weekend once a month. They were extremely involved and I love them dearly. Now comes the part where I sympathize with OP... We flew out to see their \"Nana\" (dad's mom) when kiddo was almost 4. And his sisters were there for a visit. It was great to see them because it had been a couple years. They have never used kiddo's nickname due to the short time thay'd spent with them previously. We were at the playground one day and the youngest one started calling kiddo \"Honor\" (the original shorthand I had in mind, but couldn't stand anymore). My kiddo didn't respond the first couple times until their aunt made it clear she was referring to them. The oldest aunt started in too. Then kiddo started responding. I didn't notice it immediately but after the first few minutes of it, it clicked that auntie was using this as a new shorthand name. I called the aunties over and asked Nana if she could play with kiddo for a minute. I walked with the aunts a ways away so kiddo was nowhere in earshot and asked that they do not call them by that name. The youngest said it was out of respect to kiddo's dad, since he was an Army veteran (honestly, I had never before tied this nickname to their dad or patriotism at all when I had originally wanted to use it). And that their family wanted kiddo to have that special bond with their dad. Without expressing the level of anger I felt inside, I calmly explained to them that their brother was not involved in kiddo's life at all and, by that time, had only seen them 3 times and those visits were while he was already in town for our college homecoming football game and he was visiting his frat brothers. That kiddo and dad had no bond and that I prefer they use kiddo's full name, as they had been using previously, or their current shorthand name that they had grown up with since birth. I even told them the nickname my own family had called them to include them in that bond. But I made it clear that Honor would not be used and was not appropriate, especially if the reasoning behind it was to give a bond to their dad. If a bond was needed with dad, that's on him not his sisters. But kiddo has never been told about why they are not called Honor, in fact the name is never really brought up at all.", "Sir\u2026 this is Wendy\u2019s\n\nAlso ITT: People who forgot that the names Molly and Mary Jane are some of the top names in the Western World", "When I was going by the same name as a family friend (essentially a platonic uncle) everyone referred to us as \"X the elder\" and \"X the younger,\" maybe that's an option for the Sarahs", "I did think it was a strange decision when my niece was born.
