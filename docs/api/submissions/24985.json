Oh, and they do large IV infusions, over a number of days, for many hours each day - to attempt to reset the body's pain alarm system from screaming increasingly loudly (i.e. increasingly painfully) and without ceasing, to hopefully put an end to certain types of the worst chronic pain disorders. They can also put the patient into a coma, and make the dosage even more radically extreme. This is a relatively new treatment, just barely beginning around 2010. But, as a few patients died unnecessarily from the coma version - the still highly intense, but slightly less dangerous multiple day version is much more popular, lol.", "I'm going to say this is a soft ESH. I think your sister is definitely being unreasonable as nicknames are fun, your niece loves it, and it's a special thing between the two of you (which your niece will always remember and cherish for that reason). Also, ignore the people saying YTA because of the nickname being an illegal substance. I think the nickname is adorable, and honestly, if anything comes to mind other than it being a sweet nickname, it's the cereal brand special k haha. \nHowever, the reason I say a soft ESH, is because in the end your sister is the parent, and you should try to respect her wishes. \nThat said, I think there's something more going on here as to why your sister doesn't want you to use the nickname. Idk if she's jealous you have something special with her daughter or not, but if she really won't have any sort of adult conversation with you about it, I would suggest talking to your mom. Ask her what her opinion is, and see if she would be willing to sort of mediate a convo between you and your sister about this. \nIn the meantime, maybe you can try talking to your niece, and when she gets upset if you won't call her special k, try gently explaining to her (in an age appropriate manner) that her mom doesn't like it when you use that nickname, so you are trying to be respectful of that. You can also just try whispering it to her occasionally (like if you're saying goodnight to her, when you're giving her a hug, just quietly whisper 'goodnight special k' in her ear), that way she doesn't feel like she's been left out or like you don't care about her anymore, but then you're also not using it all the time and flaunting it in front of her mom. \nBut really you guys just need to have a civil, adult conversation about this.", "YTA. people saying you're are not really don't know that the street name for ketamine is special K?

I had to dig through links regarding the Kellogg's brand cereal and it's many varieties before I found ONE link that mentioned the ketamine thing.\n\nStarting to wonder if the reason sister is so upset with the nickname because she thinks of the slang term for a street drug, and OP is confused because she doesn't know why nicknaming her niece after a cereal packed with vitamins and minerals is a bad thing. \ud83e\udd14", "special k is a breakfast cereal lmao ... not sure why your mind jumped immediately to ketamine", "I feel like the Kellogg brand cereal would probably be a more common association than drug slang from the 60s.

Never heard of it before.", "I mean if OP isn't at her school how would any other kids find out about this?", "NTA. OP is young herself, not much older than her niece. It sounds like it was an innocent way to adjust to the little stranger with the same name who is now living with her. No harm intended, but big sis is controlling and has to step in and squash their bonding. It sounds as if big sis has major issues with OP. Maybe there was jealousy that OP lives with mom and was cared for, while big sis had to move in because she couldn\u2019t survive otherwise. In any case, the sister should back off. Her child is not being harmed. Yes she is the parent and her wishes should be respected, but the daughter likes the nickname, and her wishes should be respected as well.", "Lol that could be true too. Unless the kids at her school know what special k is in terms of drugs. Then a whole other issue will arise", "Especially nowadays with everyone going YASSSS, it would have been awful!", "Yep. And five is old enough to have preferences. \u2018But I wanted her to be called\u2026.\u2019 is nonsense once a person can makeup their own mind about a nickname.", "Could that be a possibility of her being upset?

But mom just seems to have missed out on the occurrence of nicknames in the world.", "I don't think so? She didn't bring it up and wasn't even really focused on the nickname itself, just that I was calling her anything besides her actual name.", "I mean...it is? People are still naming their kids Molly.", "For humans named Molly it is.", "Never even came close to thinking it was the drug until I saw some comments about it.", "Or a nurse lol.

Just pointed out that it's also a cereal brand, not just a piece of slang used by users and pushers (medical professionals use the actual name).

I am having a giggle that there are multiple ways to make this a horrible nickname and people are still defending it even though mom said no.", "Anonymousgirl is no longer anonymous. :)", "It's weird. But I know that culturally for me it's considered disrespectful to give nicknames. Have gotten in trouble a couple of times for giving people nicknames before.", "That's NTA then.

But I don't think anyone with a child named Molly changed their kids name when the Rave scene got big.

Most people would assume it's about the cereal.", "First, I am neither a \"user\" nor a \"pusher\". Just a boring middle aged lady  that doesn't eat cereal. \n\nSecond- I'm not upset.

Bffr.", "How many animals do you sedate with ketamine? Just curious. How many patients have you treated for ODing on Special K? Or mixed too many things with Special K?

And I didn't call you either of those things. I said that it was used by users and pusher (being slang for a street drug) and that most other people outside of that do give far more kind associations to \"Special K\". It is literally a well known, international brand of cereal. Whether you are talking locally, state wide, national, or international, several decades old street slang is not going to outpace the recognition of an international brand. You are putting far to much weight on what is a negligible if not completely irrelevant detail", "Yeah. I feel like the odd one out here. Though I don't think OP and I share cultures, so it might really be a different issue with nicknames.", "I mean I hear special k in reference to ketamine way more than I hear anyone talk about the cereal", "While ketamine arrived in the 60s the slang special k first arrived in 1986. And is still commonly used. And since it is a party drug it is common knowledge among a lot of people not just heavy drug users. She would certainly be the asshole if she kept using it. Especially if it stuck around until the niece started school and become older where she might encounter a lot of people knowing this slang.", "We use ketamine all the time in anaesthesia and a lot of people I work with jokingly call it \"special k\". But I know that's something that generally, other people not in similar lines of work, typically won't know about. \n\nAssuming everyone thinks the same as you to assume malice from other people is very questionable.", "I wouldn't want any link between ketamine and my kid. I wouldn't want to have to explain why kids are making fun of it in a few years- the slang is more common in mainstream stuff than you think bc genuinely, I've never used it, I don't know anyone who has, I assure you I lead a very boring life, so if my boring self is making the connection, others will too.", "That probably says more about who you hang out with tbh", "im the opposite, didnt know it was slang for ketamine until i read this thread.", "A five year old and people in the social circle (both parents and children) are way more likely to think of the cereal cause the parents are probably buying it for their kids and the commercials are on tv a lot.", "Yea, meanwhile, at the grand age have 30, have only heard the reference from old D.A.R.E. material. Most people will definitely think cereal before drugs", "I've only heard it used for drugs once. On TV lol", "I'm literally a 30 year old military brat that has moved around this country ever 3-5 years.

So we changed the name. Why, if you know the negative is major, continue doing something that could have a negative effect on the child?", "Not really. I\u2019ve just seen tv shows and movies. It\u2019s a very common slang term", "Same!", "Apparently it\u2019s not as well known as I thought lol. I also just don\u2019t like the nickname in general. But if they both like it that\u2019s up to her to decide", "Obviously a 5 year old won\u2019t know about the drug, I didn\u2019t say they would. Down the road they could make that association though", "Exactly, hell I only vaguely remember hearing it\u2019s a drug reference before seeing these comments", "Might be that it is far more commonly used in Europe or that you just move in conservative circles being an army brat. \nI however who haven\u2019t touched any kind of drug in over a decade so quite conservative in my views on the subject and who I associate with. Only hear the term Special K in relation to drugs. Mainly because cereal is never a topic of conversation whereas drugs certainly is in regards to politics. But also being out clubbing with friends in a larger city it is certainly something you hear about even if you don\u2019t use it.\nAnd since kids these days partake in drug use much more than several decades ago for a majority of them it will be the main reference unless they have grown up sheltered in some Christian cult.", "Perhaps in a certain age bracket.  Today was the day I learned it was anything other than a cereal."]}
