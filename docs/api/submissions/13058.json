My sister ended up taking the phone and although there was screaming and yelling, she managed to still convince me to still come. \n\nAfter talking to her, she handed the phone back to my mom and she started apologizing profusely for not telling me and was crying the whole time. I felt bad for making my mom cry but I also did not appreciate her completely changing the plans and putting me in a situation that made me uncomfortable and her expecting me to just accept it like always.

In my book your NTA and have a free out, just tell mom your gonna pass or at very least find a hotel room in the area so you have a place to run away to.", "NTA - bait and switch is never a good thing.  Your mom omitted information she knew could change your decision to visit.  Good luck with the visit OP, hope you are able to decompress as you need.", "Just get a hotel room. That way you can still see your family and have a space to decompress and get away from everyone. Why don\u2019t you book a spa appointment while your at it. Your mental health and keeping a good relationship with your family is worth it.", "NTA\n\n  \nThat is a big change to the plans for you to not be aware of in my opinion, and I must admit I wouldn't be happy either. If as you claim, your mother withheld this information because she knew it might stop you coming, then that is really selfish given your recent difficulties. Hopefully it isn't as bad as anticipated, and you can still enjoy your week.", "NTA. She knew you would be uset and she hide it from you on purpose. \n\nIs there no other accomodation option possible?", "ESH. She kept your sister's visit from you on purpose to manipulate everyone into being together for her birthday. Rude. She should've extended invitations and been transparent like a normal person.\n\nSister needs to fuck off. She's the one who cut contact, so she's not allowed to be mad at you for being upset about mom's manipulation.\n\nYou need to understand that your mom's birthday isn't about you. You just snuck that in there like it's a coincidence. You absolutely were aware that your mom's birthday was during your spring break, you just didn't expect to have to go out of your way to be there for her. You had every right to be mad about how they managed it, or even to ask them to split costs for a hotel room if there's going to be no real accommodation for you in the apartment. But you can suck it up and deal with being around your sister for a few days for your mom's birthday, when she hasn't had a whole family birthday in years.\n\nIt may change my mind if your estrangement from your sister was caused by something other than just generally not getting along. You didn't share the details which makes me wonder if there's something there that you're afraid won't come across well. Would love to know more if it's relevant.\n\nEDIT: personality conflict seems to be that the sister's personality conflicts with general expectations for normal behavior. that being said, still ESH but a bit more mildly towards OP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you go you are enabling this kind of behaviour - both from your sister and your mother. \n\nI understand you don\u2019t want to hurt anyone, but these things are often slippery slopes, and you have been manipulated into a situation you would have actively avoided. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened, sounds like you really needed the family support. But family support is very different to family control. \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t go, and would rebook after cool off time and when I knew I would be the only visitor.

Everyone staying there is going to have anxiety like you..\n\nDon't like it, don't go.", "ESH, yes your mom should have told you before, but it honesty seems like she had a good reason not to tell you.

It's understandable that you would be upset about not being informed that your sister and her kids were going to be there when you planned to visit. It's also completely reasonable to want privacy and decompression time during your visit.

I think your mum just hopes that you two will suddenly get along and everything will be happy again. I don\u2019t think your mum meant harm, but also didn\u2019t think it through.
