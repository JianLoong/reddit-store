And not a very good one. If she really wanted to troll people, she would've stayed out of the comments and just let people go off about race for a while before finally revealing through an edit that her aunt simply has colored hair and isn't black at all. That would invalidate anyone calling her the AH for using \"colored,\" but would also invalidate anyone saying NTA on the basis that it's not appropriation if a black person is doing her hair.
