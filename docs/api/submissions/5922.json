And I think you're a liar. I don't think cutting Elle off has anything at all to do with the kids. Hannah has already proven to be a cheater by cheating with you multiple times. I think what you're actually worried about is the prospect of Hannah going back to Elle and doing to you what she did to Elle. That is NOT sufficient reason to cut your children off from the person who has been a loving and attentive caregiver.

Do you have some sort of actual safety concern about the children being with Elle? It doesn't matter that she \"wasn't a part of making them\", that isn't what makes a family.\n\nYou and Hannah both owe it to your children to give them some stability.

If you want to ruin your relationship with your kids than forbid them from seeing her however I promise it won't work out well for you in the end! \n\nAs for your wife she needs to be straight up and tell you what she wants in life because in all honesty it seems like your the back burner or on call person in her life and since you keep allowing it your setting yourself up for failure as well! \n\nIn all honesty maybe you yourself should have moved on long ago and found a healthy relationship with someone whom only wants to be with you!", "Jesus this is a confusing shitshow. \n\nSo if I'm correct, for the majority of her life your daughter lived with Hannah and Elle as her parents.

Get real, mate. \n\nIf you forbid your daughter from talking to/seeing Elle, you're making her pay the price for your and Hannah's shitty life decisions.

She's been ferreted back and forth between different households, different combinations of parents. How are you expecting her to be able to understand all of this? Elle might not be a birth parent, but she had a huge role in raising your daughter up until last year. You can try to deny that all you want, but it's true.
