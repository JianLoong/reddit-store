{"id": 24783, "submission_id": "15sqway", "title": "AITA for telling my son & his teacher it\u2019s not his job to help other kids?", "selftext": "The elementary school my (f30) son (7m) attends has a concept where first & second graders are in one class. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of this system, but it\u2019s the only school around so we\u2019ll have to manage. \n\nNow my son just went into second grade and as one of the \u201ebig\u201c kids got a first grader \u201ePhil\u201c sat next to him that he\u2019s supposed to help out when he has small questions etc. Unfortunately my son also has adhd, which makes him extremely susceptible for any kind of distraction and makes it hard for him to concentrate. He is being medicated (I\u2019m not here to discuss that) and also uses noise canceling headphones when they\u2019re supposed to work on something quietly. It\u2019s definitely helping him concentrate better and finish his school work during actual school hours instead of bringing it home to do on top of homework. \nNow in the past couple of days my son has consistently brought home a lot of school work that he couldn\u2019t finish in school. This of course stresses and discouraged him, since his homework load basically doubles and it\u2019s just too much to do for a seven year old child. When I asked him about it he said he couldn\u2019t finish it because \u201ePhil\u201c was constantly asking him questions and he therefore couldn\u2019t concentrate on his own work. I told him to tell the boy that he\u2019s happy to help with small things, but he also has to concentrate on his own work and if he has more questions to ask the teacher. \n\nYesterday he came home with schoolwork again and upon questioning told me the teacher said he\u2019s supposed to help his classmate out and has to answer the questions. So today I went to class with him and asked the teacher about it. She said it\u2019s the big kids job to help out the smaller ones and my son shouldn\u2019t get special treatment. I reiterated that he has adhd (which she knows) and that constantly being interrupted when doing work makes it extremely difficult to finish his work. To add to that constantly bring him schoolwork really brings him down and makes him feel like failure and makes him resent school as a whole, which shouldn\u2019t happen to a 7 year old. I told her I\u2019m fine with kids helping each other out, but if it gets to the point where my sons school work and mental health suffers, I expect her to step since it\u2019s not my sons job to teach but hers. \n\nShe got very mad at that and said I don\u2019t have to tell her how to do her job. It\u2019s her class and my son won\u2019t get special treatment. I wasn\u2019t happy with that so I went to the principal and explained my point again, that I was happy to have my son help out with a question or to explain small things here and there, but that his own schoolwork and mental health shouldn\u2019t suffer over it. He said he\u2019d talk to her and then email me. \n\nI told my friend about and she thinks I shouldn\u2019t have said that and that my son needs to learn to work better as a team and that sometimes needs sacrifices. My husband is firm on my side.\n\nEdit: Since I keep seeing this a lot, we\u2019re not in the US and an IEP is not a thing here. Also I\u2019m not expecting her to pay him extra attention, I\u2019m expecting her to make sure Phil doesn\u2019t completely distract him with his questions to the point he can\u2019t get his work done. He manages his work just fine with made/headphones when he\u2019s not constantly being pulled away and distracted.", "created_utc": 1692194777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15sqway/aita_for_telling_my_son_his_teacher_its_not_his/", "score": 500, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are we seriously at such a low point in this country that we are expecting children to teach other children? And no, this is not about teamwork. Kids can learn teamwork in plenty of ways and group projects are valuable when they  are older but it is not your child\u2019s job to take on the responsibility of another child\u2019s learning and completion of his assignments. \n\nWhat happens when the second grader gives the wrong answer? Does the teacher correct it? I have so many questions about how this is supposed to work.", "ADHD teacher here.\n\nYour son needs to sit on his own or with someone who will help him concentrate. \n\nDoes he have an IEP? \n\nOh and medication is good.  Ignore anyone who says otherwise.  \n\nKeep fighting for him. He has a disability and he is legally entitled to special treatment.", "NTA. I spent my whole life as a teacher's extra helper in class because I was well-behaved and had leadership abilities, so they always parked me (girl) at the badly behaved boys section or cluster, relying on my desire to learn so that I would police their behavior. This led to bullying, an inability to make friends that lasted years (because I was never near anyone I would have made friends with in class, and during free times I was doing the work I missed while the badly behaved boys were off doing something, and I missed developing some early social skills), and ultimately caused me to miss some opportunities to being in a higher math level in 7th & 8th grade. This meant that I entered high school without being in an advanced math class, dragging down my weighted GPA for my whole 4 years of school and ultimately led me to being 33rd in my class of 500 instead of number 10 or 11 where I would have ended up in advanced math. I believe this cost me the opportunity to go to my dream college, as well as losing scholarship money.\n\nAlso, it took me until the age of 30 to get diagnosed with ADHD, the same thing the badly behaved boys all had, and our ADHD's didn't match up in a good way, so they distracted me and I couldn't contain their hyperactivity, then I would be spoken to harshly for not keeping them calm, which was made much worse by what I now realize was rejection sensitive dysphoria and heightened emotions around criticism, all stemming from my ADHD. \n\nThis isn't all to catastrophize your son's current situation, and I'm over it for the most part, but to make you aware of potential consequences down the line. I was able to trace back my rejection from Cornell all the way back to 1st grade when my teacher first put me in the bad boys desk cluster. My mom protested a bit, but the teacher appeased her by saying I was developing my leadership skills. I did, at tremendous personal cost. \n\nAdvocate for your son. There was a whole conversation about this over at r/TwoXChromosomes the other day, and I was horrified to find out just how many women had been subjected to this as girls.

It can both be a badly run school district, but considering the general climate around public education in the US , they likely don't have enough resources.\n\nPS. Vote for expanded educational funding for kids for this exact reason.\n\nNTA just hope that it's circumstances and not malice", "NTA, the teacher has been trained and is paid to teach, your son is there to learn, not to do her job for her. Having an education is important and at 7 years of age he should only be doing very basic small amounts of homework.", "NTA and good for you for advocating for your son. My daughter's first grade teacher essentially did the same thing--put her in charge of an ND kid because the class was large and my daughter didn't need as much help. I had to have the same 'not her job' conversation with the teacher, but fortunately for us, she took it well and apologized.", "NTA. Absolutely not. It what world does this teacher think this is ok?

So good job standing up for your son, and teaching him that he has to his mental health first.", "YOU ARE NOT WRONG.", "ESH - Don't tell a teacher it's their job to teach, then bitch about the way they teach. However, a teacher should take care of parents' worries about how their child is reacting to the method of teaching.   \n\n\nMentorship is a great thing to encourage in children that'll help stave bullying and fear, and helps children be open about problems and think of different ways of looking at problems. However, your child's homework should not be doubled which if that's the issue then the solution for the teacher to have \"office hours\" where a child is not mentoring and instead focuses only on their work.  These are off the cuff suggestions and not meant to solve any problems you and the teacher are having in regards to your son's education.", "NTA\n\nShit like this is why I homeschool. We started with an online public school (it was state, not county, based). It helped us to determine if it was going to be doable. \n\nBy 3rd grade we were done with a school year, consistently, in February. We homeschooled 4th grade for the rest of the year and never went back. My daughter also has adhd AND anxiety.\n\nIf your son stays in school, get him an IEP or another exclusionary program.

I'm working with the other group, and we're doing spelling.\"\n\nThe kids who were doing their math had older kids they could call on to ask them about the processes, and that freed up time for the teacher to focus on the group doing their spelling. It helped all of the children because the younger kids were getting explanations from peers, more on their level as opposed to a teacher who may have given the kids more broad explanations. Meanwhile, every time an older child explained something to a younger one, it reinforced what the older child had already learned, helping them to understand it better and therefore explain it better.\n\nPerhaps you should see if the teacher can switch your son's partner with someone who is less demanding on his time for questions and other issues. Check your local laws and see what things are made available to your son in the classroom to accommodate his ADHD. I believe that it's classified as a learning disability in many countries (it is here in the US), and the laws governing disability access probably have policies in place to help him, such as bringing in a tutor or note taker for him.", "NTA!", "NTA your friend sucks and the school sucks.", "I was in a 4th/5th combo class (in the US) and not once was a 5th grader ever asked to assist any 4th grade student with their work.\n\nNTA. Sounds like your school is understaffed and is using student teamwork learning to lighten the load. I would not accept this as a parent. Your child deserves their own education.", "NTA\n\n> It\u2019s her class and my son won\u2019t get special treatment. \n\nHe needs accommodation for his ADHD. Calling it \u201cspecial treatment\u201d when he already has more challenges than other students to finish his work is appalling.\n\nAnd you are right, his education shouldn\u2019t suffer because of this system. That your son needs help to focus doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t work in a team - and no, a 7yo shouldn\u2019t be expected to sacrifice their education to be some sort of junior educator for another child.", "NTA but that teacher is. I hope the principal does the right thing and make sure the teacher does her job.", "When I was in primary school, we would do \"reading to little kids.\" But that was two hours a week where we helped younger kids learn to read. It was super helpful, because it let me put into words what I knew.\n\nBut the idea of being someone's mini teacher would have given me anxiety.", "ADHD or not, it's not the job of any child to be deomg with another child. What nonsense is this about being a 'big kid'? He's seven, a little boy who should be worrying only about himself and his own work.", "It's the teacher's job to teach, but not necessarily in the way OP wants. Explaining a concept is a good way to solidify understanding of the concept. That's a common teaching tool.", "The idea works really well for students who are neurotypical because it can increase their confidence in speaking to peers, encourages friendships, and students may feel more confident asking for help from peers. It can be really beneficial to both students. It gives confidence and makes them feel a part of the class to answer questions. Breaks the ice.\n\nHowever, for neurodivergent students, it can end up stressful and distracting. The teacher wasn't wrong to implement it. She was wrong in not altering plans for individual student needs.\n\nI had a teacher like that in first grade. I have ADHD myself, and the stress was so bad my parents moved me entire schools to get away from her. She was the worst.", "it's not right at all this! It's not special treatment to expect your kid to be able to focus on their own work", "What on earth? Are you posting ridiculous takes on purpose to troll people?", "Third, ADHD is often associated with learning disabilities.", "And the thing is, there can be real value for the kid doing the mentoring or tutoring.", "Yes, teaching a concept can help the teacher learn more about it. But at this exact moment, the responsibility to teach younger students is preventing OP\u2019s kid from doing his own learning.", "This is utter garbage. Parents have incredible power in US public schools. You are not \u201closing your rights\u201d. Instead, you\u2019ve been told you aren\u2019t allowed to ban books about gay people and people of color from school libraries and you\u2019re mad that sex Ed is taught in schools and that history textbooks don\u2019t glorify slavery. There\u2019s a balance in education between trusting the teachers (highly educated professionals, despite the constant anti-education, anti-union propaganda put out by conservatives) and giving parents a voice in their child\u2019s education. It\u2019s a tough tightrope to walk because a lot of parents are ignorant morons who have no business raising children.\nShould those low-information idiots be able to choose curriculum for everyone else? No. We aren\u2019t an idiocracy, as much as it feels we\u2019re heading that way. \nThis doesn\u2019t apply to lots of intelligent parents advocating for their kids. OP, you\u2019re NTA, by the way. Your kid is struggling and the accommodations you\u2019re asking for are perfectly reasonable. In this case, the teacher needs to be flexible because kids all learn differently, in different ways. Keep it up!", "ADHD is a medical issue though", "I think it works if your child is on the same learning ability as other children. I loved helping smaller kids read. I loved playing house. But when I wanted to work alone I didn't want to be bothered with other people. I have Non-Verbal Learning Disorder and ADHD. \n\nAlso, not everyone does well in a group and not being able to speak up for themselves because the group is pressuring them is also an issue.", "Yeah, it's an old concept. I'm 34 and had a mixed 4th/5th grade year. We split up for math and reading, but otherwise were learning all the same stuff. I don't remember having an older kid as \"buddy\" or a mentor, though. NTA.", "On top of this - being able to answer questions in regards to a topic shows true understanding of said topic. \n\nIt can work great for some kids. It's just very obvious that with OP's kid's diagnosed mental disability, it does him more worse than good. \n\nI wonder if it would be possible to shuffle the littles around, and give the son a little who picks things up quickly and doesn't have as many questions as \"Phil\" seems to.", "Maybe for some kids. But for OP\u2019s kid, this system is preventing him from being able to learn effectively. His education shouldn\u2019t be sacrificed because this system might work for kids who aren\u2019t him.", "Ahh, the start of many an AH tale...", "If you don't mind me asking, where are you? Someone on the thread might be able to help you with getting the equivalent of the US IEP, as in England we have both IEPs and EHCPS for children with learning needs and/or disabilities.\n\nETA: NTA,  if this was my child, they'd be doing either the work sent home or the homework, not both.", "As someone who has never really liked hanging out with younger kids (due to wanting silence) it would have been hell for me.", "Yup. I was a \u201cgifted\u201d child. Finished my work while barely looking at it. Guess who had to help the rest of the kids? I didn\u2019t mind sometimes. Especially because one teacher in particular was an idiot and I cared about my friends (I was correcting her work, 8th grade level math..). But also it wasn\u2019t my freakin job! \n\nIn our down time we could work on reading assignments (required reading) but instead I\u2019m assisting. Which really sucked because I hated the books I was reading and would have much preferred to do it during school hours than at home. The reading program is a whole other can of worms..", "I was in mixed classes in elementary school, because that was how my school handled \u201cgifted\u201d kids. For example, when I was in first grade I was in a class with 2nd graders, when I was in 3rd grade I was in a class with 4th graders, etc.\n\nThe older kids weren\u2019t expected to help us or tutor us, but we were allowed to ask questions to them if we wanted. The issue I ran into was that once I got into 6th grade, where the school ended, I had already done all of the work because they didn\u2019t have a higher level class I could go into. So because I was so \u201csmart\u201d (according to the test results), I essentially had to repeat the 6th grade.\n\nIt completely killed my interest in school because I was so bored.", "Also Canada, in the 70s. They put the challenged higher grade students in with the smarter lower grade students in the hopes that they'd meet in the middle somewhere and the teacher could teach them as one. Agreed that it didn't work.", "Actually I had the same also in Canada and it was a great system for me. Due to my mild autism getting in touch with other children was very daunting for me and this was just natural as we worked on projects together. It helped me a lot both as the older and the younger part. And it made me less akward with disabled kids as we usually had a healthy and a disabled child paired up. For instance my partner one year was blind and I described stuff for her which improved my free talking aside of my english since I was an immigrant. At the same time I had a passion for science and so we learned a lot together.\n\nThing is that it simply is not the right system for every kid. And OP is NTA for protecting son from this since he suffers with it.", "Trolling the profile says Germany.\n\nBeing in a country with a decent support system means there should be a system for accommodations to be met for a student with a neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nI'd see the kid's doctor next, or some sort of local school district coordinators for those programs and ask what next steps are if the teacher can't manage to ask one student to not direct every single question to a seat mate.", "And the kids I was supposed to help bullied me for being a nerd....", "Same.", "Personal experience for starters. Think about it. Someone should never benefit at the detriment of others.\n\nMore importantly, children do not yet have the tools to teach effectively. You\u2019re basically giving them a task without the ability to successfully complete it.", "Spot on. I hate how people try to shove kids into boxes when it comes to learning. There is no one size fits all. A system can be great for some and sh*t for others. Montessori was terrible for me due to my learning disabilities. I wasn\u2019t self motivated to learn skills that I found hard. It works great for a lot of kids though. The problem here is that when OP said this system isn\u2019t working for her child, she was told there was no alternative. He is in school to learn. If he can\u2019t learn, then the school isn\u2019t fulfilling its responsibilities to him, as the student.", "Unlikely.  More likely is that she sat 2 high needs kids at the front.  Rookie error.", "In fact I do have a bit of experience too bc a math teacher I had basically just handed us the book and told us we needed to figure it out in groups of 4-5. \nI will agree with you that asking them to teach is not effective for the receiving student but on the other hand I think it's quite beneficial to encourage them to explain what they just learned. I agree the way we may use it is not ideal but the idea behind the method has a few reedeeming qualities, have you ever understood something better than when explaining it to someone else ? \nBut yeah keeping that in mind, the current way we use this system is a toll for everyone.", "I had a lot of problems with this. I could look at the problem and just \u201cknew\u201d the answer. This was clearly problematic for the \u201cshow your work\u201d imperative and also for explaining it to others. Certainly at 10 years old I had no ability on how to break down the thoughts in my head. Especially in a manner that was comprehensible to others.", "Yeah fair point, to add to that there is probably a lot of non neurotypical kids that will have that struggle as well. I have had countless bad experiences with the eductionnal system and the want to have a \"solution\" may have altered my judgement on that subject (tho I had bad experiences with it too as I hated my math teacher and her methods)"]}
