{"id": 24783, "submission_id": "15sqway", "title": "AITA for telling my son & his teacher it\u2019s not his job to help other kids?", "selftext": "The elementary school my (f30) son (7m) attends has a concept where first & second graders are in one class. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of this system, but it\u2019s the only school around so we\u2019ll have to manage. \n\nNow my son just went into second grade and as one of the \u201ebig\u201c kids got a first grader \u201ePhil\u201c sat next to him that he\u2019s supposed to help out when he has small questions etc. Unfortunately my son also has adhd, which makes him extremely susceptible for any kind of distraction and makes it hard for him to concentrate. He is being medicated (I\u2019m not here to discuss that) and also uses noise canceling headphones when they\u2019re supposed to work on something quietly. It\u2019s definitely helping him concentrate better and finish his school work during actual school hours instead of bringing it home to do on top of homework. \nNow in the past couple of days my son has consistently brought home a lot of school work that he couldn\u2019t finish in school. This of course stresses and discouraged him, since his homework load basically doubles and it\u2019s just too much to do for a seven year old child. When I asked him about it he said he couldn\u2019t finish it because \u201ePhil\u201c was constantly asking him questions and he therefore couldn\u2019t concentrate on his own work. I told him to tell the boy that he\u2019s happy to help with small things, but he also has to concentrate on his own work and if he has more questions to ask the teacher. \n\nYesterday he came home with schoolwork again and upon questioning told me the teacher said he\u2019s supposed to help his classmate out and has to answer the questions. So today I went to class with him and asked the teacher about it. She said it\u2019s the big kids job to help out the smaller ones and my son shouldn\u2019t get special treatment. I reiterated that he has adhd (which she knows) and that constantly being interrupted when doing work makes it extremely difficult to finish his work. To add to that constantly bring him schoolwork really brings him down and makes him feel like failure and makes him resent school as a whole, which shouldn\u2019t happen to a 7 year old. I told her I\u2019m fine with kids helping each other out, but if it gets to the point where my sons school work and mental health suffers, I expect her to step since it\u2019s not my sons job to teach but hers. \n\nShe got very mad at that and said I don\u2019t have to tell her how to do her job. It\u2019s her class and my son won\u2019t get special treatment. I wasn\u2019t happy with that so I went to the principal and explained my point again, that I was happy to have my son help out with a question or to explain small things here and there, but that his own schoolwork and mental health shouldn\u2019t suffer over it. He said he\u2019d talk to her and then email me. \n\nI told my friend about and she thinks I shouldn\u2019t have said that and that my son needs to learn to work better as a team and that sometimes needs sacrifices. My husband is firm on my side.\n\nEdit: Since I keep seeing this a lot, we\u2019re not in the US and an IEP is not a thing here. Also I\u2019m not expecting her to pay him extra attention, I\u2019m expecting her to make sure Phil doesn\u2019t completely distract him with his questions to the point he can\u2019t get his work done. He manages his work just fine with made/headphones when he\u2019s not constantly being pulled away and distracted.", "created_utc": 1692194777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15sqway/aita_for_telling_my_son_his_teacher_its_not_his/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You son has a learning disability, so of course there are going to be things that don't apply to him.  I'd be distracted is someone was constantly asking me questions too.", "NTA. Are we seriously at such a low point in this country that we are expecting children to teach other children? And no, this is not about teamwork. Kids can learn teamwork in plenty of ways and group projects are valuable when they  are older but it is not your child\u2019s job to take on the responsibility of another child\u2019s learning and completion of his assignments. \n\nWhat happens when the second grader gives the wrong answer? Does the teacher correct it? I have so many questions about how this is supposed to work.", "ADHD teacher here.\n\nYour son needs to sit on his own or with someone who will help him concentrate. \n\nDoes he have an IEP? \n\nOh and medication is good.  Ignore anyone who says otherwise.  \n\nKeep fighting for him. He has a disability and he is legally entitled to special treatment.", "NTA. I spent my whole life as a teacher's extra helper in class because I was well-behaved and had leadership abilities, so they always parked me (girl) at the badly behaved boys section or cluster, relying on my desire to learn so that I would police their behavior. This led to bullying, an inability to make friends that lasted years (because I was never near anyone I would have made friends with in class, and during free times I was doing the work I missed while the badly behaved boys were off doing something, and I missed developing some early social skills), and ultimately caused me to miss some opportunities to being in a higher math level in 7th & 8th grade. This meant that I entered high school without being in an advanced math class, dragging down my weighted GPA for my whole 4 years of school and ultimately led me to being 33rd in my class of 500 instead of number 10 or 11 where I would have ended up in advanced math. I believe this cost me the opportunity to go to my dream college, as well as losing scholarship money.\n\nAlso, it took me until the age of 30 to get diagnosed with ADHD, the same thing the badly behaved boys all had, and our ADHD's didn't match up in a good way, so they distracted me and I couldn't contain their hyperactivity, then I would be spoken to harshly for not keeping them calm, which was made much worse by what I now realize was rejection sensitive dysphoria and heightened emotions around criticism, all stemming from my ADHD. \n\nThis isn't all to catastrophize your son's current situation, and I'm over it for the most part, but to make you aware of potential consequences down the line. I was able to trace back my rejection from Cornell all the way back to 1st grade when my teacher first put me in the bad boys desk cluster. My mom protested a bit, but the teacher appeased her by saying I was developing my leadership skills. I did, at tremendous personal cost. \n\nAdvocate for your son. There was a whole conversation about this over at r/TwoXChromosomes the other day, and I was horrified to find out just how many women had been subjected to this as girls. There wasn't a single voice that was glad she was subjected to this.", "NTA.

Occasionally asking another student is fine, but constantly needing so much help that another student cannot complete their work is not. \n\nIf Phil needs so much help and has so many questions that your son cannot get his work done, then Phil needs to be paired up to a diff child. One that can help and still get his own stuff done. \n\nIf the principal comes back with an unsatisfactory answer for you, I\u2019d tell my kid to just ignore Phil. Put those headphones on and be done with it.", "NTA \n\nAnd if you were in the states, a kid with an IEP would never have to deal with this.\n\nIf this continues or the teacher simply makes his life more difficult because your making gets more difficult (by asking her to do her literal job)....

You brought up a valid issue to the teacher and the principal. She needs to pair Phil with another big kid", "Nope NTA as a teacher she should know that different kids require different accommodations, especially kids with disabilities!\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be impossible to find a compromise, like your son can answer x amount of questions per lesson and after that the teacher steps in. Tbh I think that should be a rule for the entire class if the school is insisting on keeping it this way.", "NTA.  This is detrimental to your son's education and well-being.  The teacher is offloading her job and it is inappropriate, especially onto a child who needs to be accommodated for a disability.\n\nCan you get your son switched out of her class?", "NTA. For what it's worth, I'm a teacher and feel you handled this perfectly. Most teachers I've worked with are caring and dedicated. Those that aren't should be held accountable, in a calm manner, as you have done.\nThere's no villain, but she's being rigid and uncompromising where reasonable accommodations for your son should be easily, and automatically, provided by her.\nYou are accidentally helping other kids struggling in the class by advocating for your son.", "NTA. I think your request is completely reasonable given the circumstances.", "I am a teacher. The concept that they are using is called Peer Scaffolding which is only supposed to be used occasionally and should benefit BOTH students. This is too much for your son. Does he have an IEP because this needs to be discussed.", "NTA - the only person advocating for your son is you.\n\n Teaching IS the teachers job. \n\nAnd continually distracting an ADHD kid is simply asking for trouble. \n\nYour son has rights and special educational needs and they are being steamrollered in favour of the teacher not being bothered by the questions of the younger kids.

NTA. your son is not the teacher. she can do her damn job", "I'll get hate, but...how well funded are your schools?\n\nThe teachers job is not to specialize your kid over other students (doing two grades at once is crazy, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's a budget issue)\n\nSure...it shouldn't be a burden on your child. But the lack of a program for a kid like yours, the lack of having a teacher for either grade? It can both be a badly run school district, but considering the general climate around public education in the US , they likely don't have enough resources.\n\nPS. Vote for expanded educational funding for kids for this exact reason.\n\nNTA just hope that it's circumstances and not malice", "NTA, the teacher has been trained and is paid to teach, your son is there to learn, not to do her job for her. Having an education is important and at 7 years of age he should only be doing very basic small amounts of homework.", "NTA and good for you for advocating for your son. My daughter's first grade teacher essentially did the same thing--put her in charge of an ND kid because the class was large and my daughter didn't need as much help. I had to have the same 'not her job' conversation with the teacher, but fortunately for us, she took it well and apologized.", "NTA. Absolutely not. It what world does this teacher think this is ok? Is his disability not high enough on her chart for her to accommodate him? This is suspension worthy and she should be lucky she\u2019s not in trouble yet. Even English learners get special accommodations.", "NTA the teacher is a major AH it is her job.  You are 1000% correct and don't listen to those other fools your first priority is your son", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you. As a 31F with ADHD, I was constantly put in situations like this and was always told to be \"a team player\", \"work harder\", \"be more focused\", \"take on for the time\". This resulted in me finding it very, very hard to say no to things I KNOW will be detrimental to me, at work for example. So good job standing up for your son, and teaching him that he has to his mental health first.", "YOU ARE NOT WRONG.", "ESH - Don't tell a teacher it's their job to teach, then bitch about the way they teach. However, a teacher should take care of parents' worries about how their child is reacting to the method of teaching.   \n\n\nMentorship is a great thing to encourage in children that'll help stave bullying and fear, and helps children be open about problems and think of different ways of looking at problems. However, your child's homework should not be doubled which if that's the issue then the solution for the teacher to have \"office hours\" where a child is not mentoring and instead focuses only on their work.  These are off the cuff suggestions and not meant to solve any problems you and the teacher are having in regards to your son's education.", "NTA\n\nShit like this is why I homeschool. We started with an online public school (it was state, not county, based). It helped us to determine if it was going to be doable. \n\nBy 3rd grade we were done with a school year, consistently, in February. We homeschooled 4th grade for the rest of the year and never went back. My daughter also has adhd AND anxiety.\n\nIf your son stays in school, get him an IEP or another exclusionary program. It will help enforce boundaries and give him more time to complete his work as he gets older.
