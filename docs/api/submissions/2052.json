And it\u2019s a lot easier to be hurt over an invite than to accept that this person is going to marry someone who split you apart and that your friend is possibly entering into a life that may make her miserable. Having been in a similar situation, I felt powerless. I was fortunate in that my friend came to her senses, but I have some advice that helped me during the period before she did and it\u2019s advice that is helpful to me in general: you cannot control other peoples actions. You can provide perfectly sound logical reasons for why someone shouldn\u2019t do something but emotions aren\u2019t logical, and we cannot change other peoples emotions. What we can control are our own actions and the way we hand our own emotions.\n\nYou did the best you could to protect your friend. You told her about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s shitty behavior.

It\u2019s very sad, but maybe you need to give yourself some space to mourn the friendship and to realize that her life is her choice, and even if things go sour, it will not be your fault because you cannot change her mind. Now if she ever does come to her senses, if this is a truly abusive man, you can chose whether or not to offer her a spot back in your life or not. If I were you, I would take the time to heal myself from this friendship so that if that time comes, I will know what it is best for me to do. Anyway, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, but you are clinging on to a friendship that she has long since abandoned.

I wouldn't want to go to a wedding where I knew someone was making a mistake.", "YTA\n\nI have no idea why you\u2019d expect a wedding invite from a woman who you say you haven\u2019t really talked to or seen in over 2 years? Also, it\u2019s her wedding, she can decide who she wants to invite. Just like you did / were going to do. \n\nAnd if you were going to exclude her if you did have the party, why are you mad she would exclude you as well?", "OP should just let her \u201cex\u201d friend be at peace.", "YTA, but why the hell would you even want to go if you know mike hates you", "YTA lol \u201cshe isn\u2019t really my friend and wasn\u2019t at my wedding but she wouldn\u2019t invite me to her wedding\u201d", "YTA, haven't spoken in years, her FH isn't a fan of yours even though you \"introduced them\", you didn't invite her to any of your wedding events but you get mad because you aren't invited to hers? Get a life.", "If Mike is what you say he is, you don't want to be there. I saw my bff marry a toxic, abusive man and it's one of my only regrets.", "Info: you dont consider them friends at best, didnt think of inviting her to any wedding related event, you dont like how make acts, \n\nWhy do you think you even want to go unless its to see or bring drama?", "YTA. Does it matter how big your wedding was? \nYour even admitting that if it were bigger you still weren\u2019t planning on inviting her.  You introduced her to a manipulative cheater so why would you want to celebrate that? And lastly the groom hates you why would you expect to be invited. Stay out of their life even you say you haven\u2019t spoken in years move on", "YTA and honestly quite dumb. Read uour story again and tell me why tou think it does not made sense you were not invited", "I didn't invite her, but I'm pissed she didn't invite me... maybe I read wrong. I'll have to go back and triple check.", "It is the same, you decided she isn\u2019t close enough to come to your stuff and she decided you aren\u2019t close enough to come to hers. Why would she waste money on someone who doesn\u2019t think of her as a close friend.", "you needed to extend the olive branch first, because your wedding was first. period.", "Lol no you don't.  You weren't even going to invite her to your wedding.", "Is this a bad case of fomo because you're being ridiculous and entitled.", "Ynta for not inviting her and she's NTA for not inviting you. Fair is fair , also if Mike is who she is marrying would you really want to even go. You are being TA for being angry she didn't invite you however . So I say to keep from holding that title let it go. Wish her the best,  and move on with your lives.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re not friends with her, you don\u2019t wish her well, you don\u2019t love her.\n\nWhat do you actually care about here?  Your ego?\n You want her to chase after your friendship and want you when you clearly don\u2019t want her?\n\nHave a deep look at your egotistical motivations.  They will limit your personal development.", "This was very roundabout, but yeah YTA. You didn\u2019t invite her to your bachelorette party so you cannot be mad that she did not invite you to her wedding. If you were hurt, not being invited to her wedding, imagine how she felt not being invited to your bachelorette party, especially since your wedding was just one friend each and immediate family. Also, I really don\u2019t understand why you would care or want to go because you haven\u2019t talk to this woman or seen this woman in two years, she\u2019s dating an asshole who you don\u2019t like, and vice versa, and you tried to break them up. Why would you want to go to that? Who would want to go to that under those circumstances?", "Wait why are you upset that she didn\u2019t invite you when you didn\u2019t invite her? You said yourself you guys aren\u2019t close anymore", "YTA\n\nwell I didn't invite you to my wedding but how dare you not invite me to yours!\n\nthat's exactly whats happened and yes that makes you an AH", "YTA. Doesn't seem like you haven't been friends for years. Also, for some reason I read this with a Russian accent. Blyat.", "YTA, you did NOT invite her to your functions so why would you expect her to invite you??", "Dude, your story line is not perfect and some parts contradict with one another.\n\nbtw, I dont think it was your or Amy's fault that you did not get invited. I think her manipulative boyfriend manipulated her and this was the result of that.\n\nDon't get upset....Do something that will make Amy regret her weddng.", "YTA.  You get to cut her out of your life but she is supposed to include you in hers? Yeah - no.", "YTA\n\nYou ended that relationship and friendship the day you went and tried to end her relationship with her BF.  It was further evident when you did not even bother to invite her to your wedding or anything around it.\n\nNow you are upset that you were not invited to her wedding?", "Some times, I think this is less of a AITHA. But more of an \u201c let me demonstrate how stupid and out of touch I am with the world\u201d or maybe \u201c I\u2019m an entitled piece of poop and want to make myself feel better by maybe maybe getting others to agree with my shitty actions\u201d dear lord. This can\u2019t be real. \n\nOP. If that wasn\u2019t clear. YTA.", "You're mad you didn't get invited despite you not inviting her?", "Why do you want to go to this wedding? You aren\u2019t buddies anymore, and that is fine. Just mourn the death of a childhood friendship and move on.", "This is so absurd, it's hilarious. YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't invite her to anything, but expect an invite from her?\n\nIt sounds to me that you and Amy are not friends any more, and there is no reason she would invite you.\n\nYou're being very unreasonable. You two aren't friends, you've not talked to her or seen her in 2 years, you are strangers now, accept it.", "YTA you did not invite her, why would she invite you?", ">i also got engaged and my friends threw me a bachelorette party, where i decided on the list )6 friends) that didn\u2019t include Amy\n\ngee i wonder why she didn\u2019t invite you.\n\n>she blames me saying i started it all by not inviting her to my bachelorette \n\nso you were told it was your fault you weren\u2019t invited and yet you still don\u2019t know if you\u2019re the asshole? YTA", "YTA. She can invite who she pleases. You really think her husband would want you there. Despite you doing the right thing to expect an invite is ludicrous", "AITA for getting mad that my ex-friend didn\u2019t invite me to her wedding? \n\nFixed that for you", "Yta", "Right?!? I'm confused", "and you showed that by shunning her from your wedding?...", "Oh my God why are you even responding. I'm embarrassed for you. You're not friends any more.", "I assume she thought the same when she wasn\u2019t invited to your party and wedding \ud83d\ude02. Do some self reflection. You are her in the same situation and you felt fine with not inviting her so why should she invite you now?"]}
