It\u2019s ok for you to exclude her in in just a little celebration for your wedding, but she can\u2019t exclude you? You can\u2019t have it both ways. Seems like you guys have just drifted apart. Accept it and move on", "If that is true then buy her a really nice gift. Let it go. Be friends without the invite just like you expected from her.", "What relationship? You didn\u2019t invite her to your bachelorette party and you haven\u2019t spoken in two years? You kind of sound self absorbed.", "OMG. You thought something was there that SHE should invite YOU to her wedding\u2026but there wasn\u2019t enough there for YOU to invite HER to your bachelorette or wedding. You\u2019re very self centered.", "There probably was until you didn't include her in your wedding stuff. It's very clear why this has happened. YTA.", "WTF. You were the one to exclude her first! After not getting an invite to your Bachelorette party she probably thought the same.  Why on earth should she invite you when you couldn't be bothered to invite her?", "YTA for getting mad she didn't invite you.\n\nJust stay away from these two.  You do realize the distance is encouraged by him, and she's choosing to remain with him regardless.  \n\nIt's better that you consider that a friendship of the past.", "She was my best friend all through school, but not for the last 14 years", "Actually she did. She said she hasn\u2019t seen or spoken to her in 2 years", "I didnt really had a wedding, just went to city hall with my parents, brother, his parents and brother and one friend each, she knows she is not my best friend and wasnt going to be the one that i invited that day", "Well, by wanting to go to the friend\u2019s wedding to eat, drink, dance, and show her support while hanging out with all the friends, of course!", "Then why would she invite you to her wedding if you haven't been friends for 14 years", "So why are you getting all upset when you haven\u2019t talked in two years. You all don\u2019t sound like friends to me.", "But even when you were planning a bigger one you still weren\u2019t going to invite her\u2026 YTA", "But you said that if you were going to later have a wedding where you can invite guests that you have no plans to invite her to it.", "It's *irrelevant* that you got married at city hall. You didn't invite her to your wedding, so she responded in-kind. YTA."]}
