You don't owe her anything.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t ask for her to bring you into this world so that\u2019s a ridiculous stance for her to take against you.

You don't owe your mother the cost of raising you, bringing you into the world and raising you was *her* choice and responsibility. \n\nI want to compare things for you. My mother never, ever made me feel guilty for raising me even though we were low income. There was never a mention of the debt she went into to put my siblings and I through private school (which she chose to do to keep us out of the local school district that...wasn't great) until she wanted to celebrate paying it off. Even now, where I am high income and she is now average income, she *never* asks for money. She often tries to pay for lunch if we go out together (I have to be very sneaky to pay).

Dont give her nothing don't tell her you have anything. Had she needed the 700 for a drastic bill I could understand with the actual repayment. But nah I couldn't take my kids money. I still pay my kids back if they pick me up coffee. And I give them extra gas money if I got it left over out of bills.", "NTAH.

Just that first bit of your comment alone sends red flags flying \"I brought you into the world so you owe me?\" Nope, that's not how that works hun! There are many parents who birth a child but are crap parents or neglect or don't even bring up the child. It's sounds like addict behaviour, manipulative behaviour, narcissist behaviour. Has she always been a bit like that? Could be a case of narcissistic personality disorder? Or borderline personality disorder? Or just someone on drugs. You don't owe her any money. She's a full blown adult who can take care of herself. She has the means to rehab.
