My husband and I had a fight about it on the way home because he didn\u2019t stick up for me in the situation when he knew what she was saying wasn\u2019t true but he told me to just ignore her, I told him that I won\u2019t be making any contact with her or letting her see our son when he is away at work until she learns to respect me and he told me I was an asshole. I am such a peace keeper when it comes disagreements and a push over and she knows this and I think she will probably use it against me. \nAm I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE: \nI just want to thank you all for your comments and advice. I showed my husband this post and we talked and I voiced my concerns to him. He agrees that his mother has crossed too many boundaries and he should have dealt with it from the beginning but also didn\u2019t wanna cause conflict with his mother. \n\nBackstory about mil, when I first meet mil we become really close and had an amazing relationship but when her and my fil got divorced she changed and become a very mean and spiteful person (fil cheated on her with another woman) mil attempted to turn me and my husband against fil but I didn\u2019t allow it to happen and I believe that is why she started to turn against me. \n\nWhen my husband and I got married she got worse I think she was scared I was trying to take the only person she had left away from her. (Husband is an only child and a miracle baby) she become very suicidal and the smallest things brought on episodes. I think this is why my husband never confronted her, he was scared she would spiral into a suicidal state again. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to make excuses for my mil and husband because they most definitely are both in the wrong but I can understand why my husband essentially did nothing about the situation with his mother because he was scared she would spiral out of control again. (It hit him pretty hard) \n\nAfter talking to my husband he has agreed that mil is not to visit unless he is home and only if I am comfortable in letting her into our home and if she is to try and make any drama between my husband and I, including insulting me or how I parent my child or making me uncomfortable in any way whatsoever he will tell her that she will have nothing to do with our son until she apologises and I feel that it is sincere. \n\nMy husband showed me the messages he has sent to his mother, voicing both of our concerns when it comes to her behaviour towards me and that it needs to end because although he does love her very much his son and wife need to come first, there was a few other things he put in the message about boundaries we have set but I guess I will update if and when he gets a reply but I\u2019m really glad I got the confidence to be able to confront my husband about my feelings towards this all and he understood and it didn\u2019t turn into a cat fight.", "created_utc": 1684639559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nhk87/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_see_my_son_when_my/", "score": 797, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But for some reason you have double standards, it\u2019s okay for your unfaithful and cruel FIL who traumatized your MIL to be around your kids, but the traumatized person is too negative for you to want  around? \n\nYour whole family needs counseling and you should really reflect on your own values. I never understood people who make excuses for keeping toxic and cruel people in their life. You make slot of excuses for your FIL\u2019s bad behavior while at the same time condemning your MIL for having what seems like some emotional/mental breakdown. I feel bad for your MIL, it seems like she has had no support system or no one to confide in or to have her back when her entire marriage imploded and life as she knew it changed drastically. I don\u2019t believe there is any excuse for some of her behavior, but I also empathize with her because she seems to be having an emotional and mental crisis", "NTA\n\nYour MILs behavior has been atrocious.    \nTell Husband that YOU and your child are supposed to come first in his life and he darn well better put the two of you first.\n\nDont respond to MIL.  Hubby can do all the responding.  Don\u2019t allow MIL to see your child unless hubby is around.  You don\u2019t need her negativity.  And minimize contact even with hubby around.\n\nIve been dealing with a self-centered MIL for over 30 years.  I ignore her.  She caused an issue with our daughter 30 years ago, and I\u2019ve pretty much ignored her ever since", "NTA and regarding the updates you made: I\u2019m glad that your husband has finally decided to do the bare minimum, but please make sure to keep him accountable. \n\nRemember: He\u2019s allowed her to be truly awful to you and your son. He\u2019s allowed her to snatch his baby away from its mother & keep his crying baby away from its only source of food. He\u2019s allowed her to disrespect you in every single way possible. From lying about the way you treat her and denying you ever msg her to abusing you and your parenting skills.\n\nThis is a problem that\u2019s gone on for many years and you cannot expect him to change completely overnight, it will take a long time for him to fully understand how to stand up to her without being manipulated, but you must keep on top of him about it and make sure that he keeps his word and works hard to be a better partner and father.  \n\nUnfortunately your MIL sounds 100% like the kind of person who would weaponise her mental health and use claims of suicide to get her way. You\u2019d husband may want to look into counselling  to help him deal with the trauma he\u2019s felt, being scared him mum may die and worried about anything he says triggering her. If he chooses not to do that then hopefully he can at least come to see the difference between when his mum is truly needing his support and when she is simply weaponising her mental well-being to get her way and to break up the 2 of you. \n\n\nGood luck OP. I really hope everything works out for you and that your husband has truly turned a corner.", "She claims that FIL wasn\u2019t a good man to MIL but that he was good to her and her husband and at the end of the day her FIL is still her husband\u2019s father. Honestly, if I were MiL I\u2019d totally find myself disliking my DIL if she continued to insist my cheating husband was a good man while knowing he  treated me like shit. I really don\u2019t get people who defend people that purposely hurt others", "Take my poor man's gold \ud83e\udd47\n\nThis comment is literally the only thing OP needed ro read", "While your MIL doesn\u2019t sound like a peach recently, I honestly think this bit of information makes me hesitant to completely call her an asshole. I really don\u2019t understand how people justify and defend someone who cheats. I mean the emotional and mental trauma of being cheated on is very real and I\u2019d probably be upset if my DIL defended my cheating ex.", "\n\nKeep a journal, hold fast to not being pressured into dealing with her one on one. Get a ring doorbell.  Get off social media, stop chatting about your daily life or any plans with people she knows.", "NTA. Your husband is. Being embarrassed that people online agree that he's crap isn't the same as changing, and neither is texting his mommy a few times. She shouldn't be allowed in your home at all, even when your horrible husband is there.", "Clearly NTA.", "Where does it say OP defended her FIL? You seem to make all kind of assumptions. She just said: \u201c\u2026 mil attempted to turn me and my husband against fil but I didn\u2019t allow it to happen\u201d. What\u2019s wrong with that?", "Oh my **GOD**, NTA! I'm so sorry!! Your mother-in-law is absolutely toxic and your husband isn't much better for enabling that behavior! I'm glad your husband is getting better about standing up for you now, and I hope he continues to do so. I think you're absolutely right to not let your mother-in-law visit unless your husband is present. If she doesn't agree to that, you may have to cut contact with her entirely. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, and I hope things improve for you and your family (no, that doesn't include your mother-in-law, and won't unless she stops being so toxic) soon!", "I just want to clarify a few thing with this reply firstly mine and my mother in law\u2019s relationship went bad when my FIL first filed for divorce before we even found out why, I never once said I defended my FIL because I didn\u2019t, yes I said he is a good man because he is a good man to me and my husband and when we found out he was cheating the relationship changed completely. (I also never have told MIL that my FIL is a good man, I don\u2019t even talk about FIL in front of her) \n\n my husband still wanted to have a relationship with his father it was not my decision, but yes I was the one that pushed for him to keep the relationship with his father because that\u2019s what he wanted but didn\u2019t know to do it. \n\nAnother thing you seems to be assuming is that my FIL sees my child, he doesn\u2019t live in the same state as me and my husband and therefore barely sees my child."]}
