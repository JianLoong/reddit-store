She then sat at my house for 4 hours, criticised how I was parenting my son and refused to give me my son when he would cry even when he was hungry cause she \u201cwanted to hear him cry\u201d when she finally gave me my son back I tried my best to discreetly breast feed cause it was hard for me to get up and walk out to go somewhere else due to my c section. When my son finally latched I was able to relax a bit but then she proceeded to pull her camera out and try and take photos of me breastfeeding, when I voiced that I was uncomfortable my husband told her to back off so she put the phone away and stood right in front of me and just watched my son feed. \n\nMy husband works doing fifo and when he went back to work after 2 months off, my mil would message me asking how I was handling everything and I would always say the same thing, everything was going fine, I was keeping busy and I was very lucky to have got such a easy baby and say that we should catch up but she would always ignore my messages then message my husband saying I don\u2019t respond to her messages and am very rude when I do, my husband and I had multiple fights because of it until I sent him the screenshots of our messages but he never confounded his mother about it. \n\nSkipping to Mother\u2019s Day we did a lunch with his mum and she was sick so we kept our distance so our son didn\u2019t get sick, she kept making rude comments to me the whole time about how I\u2019m trying to keep her grandson away from her and she\u2019s never allowed to see him. My husband and I had a fight about it on the way home because he didn\u2019t stick up for me in the situation when he knew what she was saying wasn\u2019t true but he told me to just ignore her, I told him that I won\u2019t be making any contact with her or letting her see our son when he is away at work until she learns to respect me and he told me I was an asshole. I am such a peace keeper when it comes disagreements and a push over and she knows this and I think she will probably use it against me. \nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1684639559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nhk87/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_see_my_son_when_my/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stop playing peace keeper, if your husband doesn't support you. Tell him he can be a momma's boy or a husband and father, but unless he stands up for you, he can't be both.", "NTA. but honey, you are fighting a losing battle if your husband isn\u2019t putting you and your son first. Get therapy or get out now before she can try and file for grandparents rights.", "Dear, you not only have mil problem but a husband problem as well. \nTalk with him. Go to therapy together if can. \n\nNTA", "NTA \nYour husband is the AH for not having your back and being a coward to his mother! This needs to be the hill you die on or it'll only get worse. \n\nDo not talk to her at all. Let your husband deal with her BS.", "NTA....your husband is, though. He really needs to grow a set & tell his mother to back off.", "NTA-this story belongs on @Justnomil on Reddit. She does not respect you and your husband isn\u2019t sticking up for you. This is ridiculous behavior and she needs to start respecting you and your boundaries.", "Head on over to r/justnoMIL to hang with the sisterhood! \nNTA for trying make and keep boundaries for your health and sanity. YWBTA if you didn't recognize that you have a husband problem first, and that needs to be where you start, or else it will be where you finish! Good luck mom", "NTA, she sounds horrible! If your husband won\u2019t stand up for you stand up for yourself. Lay out strong boundaries.", "NTA- and it sounds like your husband is a momma's boy, and worse, that your MIL wants a husband-son.  yes this is a thing.  she wants your job.  she wants you gone.  and she's not going to stop until she drives you out of his life.  You need to have a serious conversation with your husband about his absolutely psycho mother.  make it clear to him that if he's not careful he'll be left living with his mother into his 60s with no girl ever good enough for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you don't start taking this seriously she's going to escalate.  there was a crazy story i read recently about a MIL who destroyed her son's marriage by PAYING a stranger to fake an affair with his wife.  paid him $500, this guy created text messages and a story and told the husband he had been sleeping with his wife.  Broke the marriage up.  the MIL didn't come clean about the lie for 4 years, when the guy got a girlfriend and in a fit of rage about it, she complained how it took her 12 years to get rid of the last one, he asked her what she meant and the lie started to unravel.\n\ntake this type of crazy seriously.  this woman wants your kid and her son back, and there is no telling what she might do to get it.  you'll need to convince your husband the problem else you'll be fighting a losing battle.  the woman in the prior story's husband had gone NC with the mother for years because of her behavior, and she still won in the end.", "NTA Your husband needs to learn how to stand up to his mother.  I hope it never comes to this, but please save up an emergency fund in case he never learns how to put his family first.  You don't want to be stuck with a mama's boy if you're ready to get out.\n\nYou're right to not want to be around her, she sounds miserable. If you don't already get cameras for the exterior and interior in case she tries randomly showing up.", "NTA  \nYour husband problem is even worse than your MIL problem.  He is a coward who won't stand up to his mommy. Please don't back down on this, time to stop being the peacekeeper and to insist on the respect you deserve.", "NTA- stay strong as your MIL is trying to get in-between you and your husband as well. He needs to stand up for you.", "NTA, you have a MIL problem but you also have a husband problem. He should not be fighting with you over something his mother tells him. He should believe you, trust you and ask you before having an argument. \nYour husband needs to step up and deal with his mother.", "The villain in this story is your husband.", "NTA - Your son and their growth is your concern not hers. You have to establish boundaries or it will get worse.", "NTA. Relatiobship counseling seems to be in order here and if your husband won't, and he won't stand up to his mother and support you-then it's divorce time.", "NTA. you need to put up the boundaries and stick to them now, otherwise she will run all over you. She sounds toxic AF! And agree with the comment about your husband...is he the momma's boy or is he gonna back up his wife?", "Nta, I would tell your husband you will not be dealing with his mom.
