My husband and I had a fight about it on the way home because he didn\u2019t stick up for me in the situation when he knew what she was saying wasn\u2019t true but he told me to just ignore her, I told him that I won\u2019t be making any contact with her or letting her see our son when he is away at work until she learns to respect me and he told me I was an asshole. I am such a peace keeper when it comes disagreements and a push over and she knows this and I think she will probably use it against me. \nAm I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE: \nI just want to thank you all for your comments and advice. I showed my husband this post and we talked and I voiced my concerns to him. He agrees that his mother has crossed too many boundaries and he should have dealt with it from the beginning but also didn\u2019t wanna cause conflict with his mother. \n\nBackstory about mil, when I first meet mil we become really close and had an amazing relationship but when her and my fil got divorced she changed and become a very mean and spiteful person (fil cheated on her with another woman) mil attempted to turn me and my husband against fil but I didn\u2019t allow it to happen and I believe that is why she started to turn against me. \n\nWhen my husband and I got married she got worse I think she was scared I was trying to take the only person she had left away from her. (Husband is an only child and a miracle baby) she become very suicidal and the smallest things brought on episodes. I think this is why my husband never confronted her, he was scared she would spiral into a suicidal state again. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to make excuses for my mil and husband because they most definitely are both in the wrong but I can understand why my husband essentially did nothing about the situation with his mother because he was scared she would spiral out of control again. (It hit him pretty hard) \n\nAfter talking to my husband he has agreed that mil is not to visit unless he is home and only if I am comfortable in letting her into our home and if she is to try and make any drama between my husband and I, including insulting me or how I parent my child or making me uncomfortable in any way whatsoever he will tell her that she will have nothing to do with our son until she apologises and I feel that it is sincere. \n\nMy husband showed me the messages he has sent to his mother, voicing both of our concerns when it comes to her behaviour towards me and that it needs to end because although he does love her very much his son and wife need to come first, there was a few other things he put in the message about boundaries we have set but I guess I will update if and when he gets a reply but I\u2019m really glad I got the confidence to be able to confront my husband about my feelings towards this all and he understood and it didn\u2019t turn into a cat fight.", "created_utc": 1684639559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nhk87/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_see_my_son_when_my/", "score": 437, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Requiring he be present to supervise his mom for your safety seems necessary. He can't expect you to navigate the social relationships with his family without his participation.

Secondly, grabbing at someone's baby from their arms without permission is completely unacceptable, and it's a good way to run into a stiff arm onto your arse or a fist to the mouth.\n\nYour husband should've nipped her behavior in the bud long before you gave birth, but that ship has sailed. He *certainly* should've intervened in her aforementioned disrespectful display upon entering your home after you gave birth, but somehow *that* ship has also sailed. *Terrible* look for hubby on that one. Since we are where we are and he can't do the right thing in those past circumstances, it is **incumbent** upon him to set MIL straight *very clearly* on what is acceptable treatment of the mother of his child going forward.\n\nThis would be a hill to die on for me. **She does not get to treat you this way, full stop.** He needs to either fix it(!!!!) or fully support however little contact you want between you, her, and your baby.
