They never got along since they were children. As adults it got worse. So i planned my wedding without them even knowing. I didnt wanr getting into a fight during what turned out to be a beautiful day. Both my brothers have passed, one 8 years ago, the other a week ago.

It made our wedding a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere that our 20 guests enjoyed.
