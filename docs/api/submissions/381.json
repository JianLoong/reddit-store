My (36f) fiance (50m) and I had an argument this evening. \n\nWe had plans with a couple for tomorrow that he's friends with and I've only met twice. I have a little social anxiety, which is important later. \n\nMy fiance invited these friends to come over. Sort of. The two men would be playing golf while myself and the wife would stay home and cook a nice dinner. It's a little 1950s, but whatever. He had been bugging me for a while so I finally agreed. \n\nAnyway, I had a very busy day today at work and was very tired. And I was noticing that the closer this get-together got, the more anxiety I felt over being alone with someone I don't know for several hours. So when I got home, I asked my fiance if he could please (like, I really said please) play 9 holes instead of the full 18.\n\nThis pissed him off, saying I'm embarrassing him, making him change it to 9 holes. I asked him how that could possibly be embarrassing, and suggested a few ways to bring it up. He refused and said since he has more friends, I don't understand being embarrassed. Ok, I don't have a ton of friends, but I have 2 extremely close, lifelong friends. \n\nI explain that I'm asking him a favor, to just kinda meet me halfway. Now he's getting even more mad, saying that it's unacceptable to ask that of him. So he says he's just going to cancel, because that's less embarrassing than asking to play 9 holes. I told him that was ridiculous, no one is asking him to cancel, just adjust the amount of time we spend separate. \n\nWell, he canceled, saying I have covid. And now,I know damn well I'm never going to hear the end of this from my fiance, about how I forced him to cancel. Which literally isn't even true. \n\nSo, I called him an AH and he told me I'm a terrible person and has locked himself in his office. \n\nSo, reddit, AITA? I guess I could be TA for asking him to change the plans, but I really don't think it was an unreasonable ask. \n\nTldr; social anxiety got me worked up about friends of my fiance's visiting tomorrow and I asked him if we could adjust the plans. He blew up and now won't talk to me.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Having the men go play and then meeting up with the wife later was not an option. The husband would not go if his wife was left home. I don't know why, but there we were.", "created_utc": 1667137448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhen91/aita_for_asking_my_fiance_to_play_9_holes_instead/", "score": 472, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And rather than being empathetic about your anxiety, and helping you find solutions that work, he is angry and embarrassed about it.

That casual insult about having more friends is telling. He doesn't sound like a nice person, and certainly you make it sound like he's going to hold this incident over your head for a long while.

That's a perfectly fair compromise, and if he can't see that, there's a good chance he won't compromise on anything.

Talk to him about it. Get help (with or without him) to overcome and deal with this anxiety for your own good and really think if he is the right one for you. If he helps you, then that's great.

He's the AH here. \n\nHow many people would willfully committ to a 5 hr blind date immediately followed by a double date? That's pretty much what this is and I think it would make most people uncomfortable. It was a weird way to introduce you to the wife. But some people (especially older ones) hear \"social anxiety\" and go straight to some idea of millennials being dysfunctional babies unable to exist offline. He may need to get a better understanding of what you're experiencing as well as how it was kind of a big ask of you. Nothing wrong with being \"a little 1950s\" and trying to get the girls to bond so you can have a good couple friendship but I'd expect that to come later after some level of friendship is already established. The friend's wife was probably nervous too.\n\nThe \"embarrassing\" part: maybe they aren't close friends? If it were a close friend, he could literally just explain things honestly. But maybe he thinks it'll draw negative attention to him dating younger? I would guess that this is more of an acquaintance that he was wanting to get closer to and that's why he felt nervous confronting the guy and going off-script. Dude's projecting his own anxiety.", "\u00a8NTA . clearly your partner has no friends, his friends clearly don't see him as equal since you is too chicken to ask them for a simple favor.

And I was noticing that the closer this get-together got, the more anxiety I felt over being alone with someone I don't know for several hours. So when I got home, I asked my fiance if he could please (like, I really said please) play 9 holes instead of the full 18.\n\nThis pissed him off, saying I'm embarrassing him, making him change it to 9 holes. I asked him how that could possibly be embarrassing, and suggested a few ways to bring it up. He refused and said since he has more friends, I don't understand being embarrassed. Ok, I don't have a ton of friends, but I have 2 extremely close, lifelong friends. \n\nI explain that I'm asking him a favor, to just kinda meet me halfway. Now he's getting even more mad, saying that it's unacceptable to ask that of him. So he says he's just going to cancel, because that's less embarrassing than asking to play 9 holes. I told him that was ridiculous, no one is asking him to cancel, just adjust the amount of time we spend separate. \n\nWell, he canceled, saying I have covid. And now,I know damn well I'm never going to hear the end of this from my fiance, about how I forced him to cancel. Which literally isn't even true. \n\nSo, I called him an AH and he told me I'm a terrible person and has locked himself in his office. \n\nSo, reddit, AITA? I guess I could be TA for asking him to change the plans, but I really don't think it was an unreasonable ask. \n\nTldr; social anxiety got me worked up about friends of my fiance's visiting tomorrow and I asked him if we could adjust the plans. He blew up and now won't talk to me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can do whatever I want, but cannot say whatever I want, that's become clear.", "No. It does not.", "Seconding all of this. I was in a similar relationship years ago - big egomaniac. Was exciting to be with him and I thought he was super smart and charming, as well as being very social. My tight circle of good friends did not like him at all and eventually told me so, as did several  \"friends\" of his who asked me what on earth I was doing with that AH. They were all right but my friends risked a lot to tell me the truth and I've never forgotten it. Also now very happily married to a much better man, so there's that too \ud83d\ude42.", "It's definitely something we struggle with. I tend to get loud, but never hurtful. He gets loud and hurtful.", "Well he thinks it's the end of the world and said he  doesn't want a partner that's going to alienate him from his friends. Wtf?", "Because she doesn't golf and the husband didn't want to go if she was left at home.", "I've only met her twice, for short time, but she seems really nice. Someone else suggested the same and that would have been great if i had thought of it.", "He would be abusive even if it wasn\u2019t an age gap relationship.", "30 year old women are no easier to control then a 50 year old. She isnt 18 shes a grown adult.", "You're probably right.", "I'm 54 and I would definitely not put up with that crap. Second Wave feminism (1970s) happened when we were children. He has no excuse.\n\nI am not particularly socially anxious and trying to cook dinner with someone I don't know is a situation I would have many questions about. Starting with \"what about this makes you think it's a good idea?\"\n\nNTA.", "Hmmm interesting thought.  Probably dead on target too.  What do you think OP?", "I think it bothers him when we don't agree on something. I'm not sure what he thinks, exactly, but he often makes a mountain out of a molehill just because we have a difference of opinion.", "I have no idea. Probably not.", "Tbh I think you are the asshole for berating OP about this.\n\nNTA. Absolute insane to complain about it being a social faux paux to only play 9 holes. You are promoting propel caving to idiotic social pressure rather than enjoying their own leisure activities in a way that fits their own schedule.", "I like my alone time. So i have zero problem if he wants to go out and play golf or do whatever and leave me home.", "Thank you", "Fyi...18 holes would take about 5 hours", "Oh, not just five hours but golf isn\u2019t a Talking game except for \u201cwhere is my ball?\u201d", "Lol I actually agree to do this a couple of years ago! The guys went to a game or something and the other woman and I stayed home. We hadn't met before but I'd met him, so I figured it was worth a shot. It started out a bit awkward, but we ended up having a blast and we weren't ready to end the evening when the guys got back!", "There are definitely more reasons than just being a creep. Speaking as someone with a disabled wife, I don't really go out without her either, if she's feeling up for it. She might need my help, and if we're out together and things go wonky I'm there to help her exit. Probably not the case here, since he's leaving her with someone else, but still.", "This reminds me of a former \"best friend\" from high school. I ignored so many red flags because we got along great otherwise and I was in desperate need of a friend. However, the issues that did crop up were almost always at my expense. I took way too long to realize I didn't have to stand for it. The damage of toxic relationships just isn't worth it.", "That's the definition of lashing out though?", "Getting mad and lashing out about petty things is not ok.  Don't let yourself be treated this poorly.", "Why are you marrying this person? He\u2019s a jerk. \n\nThink for a second if he would even remotely consider it if the request was flipped. Would he be game to stay home for a day and make Thanksgiving dinner with the partner of your friend that he doesn\u2019t know. And you go out to the spa for the day or something. Hell no! A normal not jerky person wouldn\u2019t dream of asking much less pressuring their partner this way. Do you really want to spend a lifetime with someone who when your needs are divergent puts himself first and doesn\u2019t care about your well-being? Parenting is hard and I guarantee he won\u2019t show up in the ways the matter if he\u2019s acting like a petulant child about this.", "But does that happen frequently? I don't think my husband has ever been mad enough to make him lash out.", "I\u2019m sorry you are in this situation.  A partner should not be petty, and hold things over you.  They should support you and talk disagreements out.  Sometimes my husband and I get into arguments, totally normal & healthy, and when we do we cool down and talk things out.  It\u2019s not healthy to keep score of who\u2019s right and who\u2019s in the wrong.\n\nAlso how often is he mad?", "Girl, I've been married for 8 years. My husband NEVER lashes out when he's mad. You deserve better and it exists out there.", "Then I ask again, WHY ARE YOU WITH THIS MAN? Do you not want to have opinions? I mean, I know this dynamic can work, but you don\u2019t sound like the passive \u201cyes, sir\u201d type that he is looking for in a wife", "Stop making excuses for him. In every answer you empathize with him, but you do not get that consideration back.", "please do not tell me that he's on this business that you dumped your entire life savings into and if you must say that please do not tell me that he's put no equity into it himself...", "You need to really think about if that\u2019s something you can live with. It is very hard to stifle your true self day after day and if you already have anxiety, I would think you would see the that coming out more and more with the stress you are carrying. I truly wish you well, OP.", "Obviously you can't do whatever you want, either...", "I'm not particularly anxious and I would be furious if my husband insisted I entertain a stranger for four hours\u2014cooking a meal together!!!!\u2014while he was out having fun. They sound like a weird, codependent couple too, if the wife couldn't stay home alone until golf was over and then you all meet up. You're the only non-asshole in the bunch, though your crybaby peepaw partner is the most gapingest of all the AHs.", "hey honey, honest question: how often do you come first in this relationship in comparison to his \"friends\", and how often does he make tiny things you need like this \"worldending\"?", "That's manipulation. He's trying to make you feel guilty and like you did something wrong so that you stop thinking about your own needs.", "But how is that your problem? Hanging out as a foursome I understand, but forcing you to babysit a grown woman is weird and unreasonable. Playing 9 holes is more of a compromise than he deserves.\n\nIt\u2019s not either of our business but it\u2019s now bugging me why this woman can\u2019t stay home by herself!", "So set it up with the wife and act like it's a surprise for your husband's because they had to cancel since you had \"covid\". Husband's get to golf and you get a girl's day out. Win win", "No doubt, but for some reason relationships with age gaps are particularly unhealthy.", "A 50 yo woman would either join in golfing or take his friends wife to the spa for the day & tell her fianc\u00e9 to pick up dinner for HIS friends on his way back from golfing. Asking her to sit home for hours & cook an elaborate dinner for the men while they play is misogynistic bs. The 14 year age gap makes it easier to control her. A 50 yo would not be asking is she was the AH because she would know the only AH here is the fianc\u00e9.", "He wants his way every time, he likely wants you to be a \u201cgood little wife\u201d and submit to everything he wants", "The way this is working out is either  \n1. You will lose your own self so much you will agree with EVERYTHING he says to avoid aggravation.  \n2. You will finally stand up for yourself, your opinions & individuality.   \nThen, you will either leave with your head held high knowing you deserve better. OR he leaves to find a newer more compliant model.", "What a total load of crap. Most golfers want to play 18, the husband wanted to play 18, the husbands friend would have wanted to play 18. Social pressure lmao!\n\nShe never should have agreed to the plan or suggested the husbands go play golf and they could meet later for dinner instead of the wives hanging out.", "Damn that's even worse lol", "Oh God, he loses so many balls.", "I'm glad that worked out for you but I wind up just putting on my \"professional small talk\" face and I hate doing that. I'll do it for his work stuff, because I'm great at it, but it's definitely not my idea of a good time. I don't like people that much lol. \n\nAlthough now I'm wondering how many of these women I've been \"set up\" with by various partners had a blast (I hope so, I was trying hard!)", "I was going to say that it doesn't make it ok to have an unwilling and unaware stranger look after his wife. I do think it's just paternalism and when OP speaks of a 50's vibe, well yes, spot on. And red flag.", "I don't know what you consider frequent. We never argue about big things. It's just the little, stupid stuff. But he tends to make it easy bigger than it needs to be and can be mean in the process.", "Not incredibly often. But it'll be something tiny that I say and he gets weirdly offended. Even after explaining that his irrational interpretation is not at all what I meant, he doesn't care and then it just gets bigger.", "I'm not. And he wasn't this way until after we moved in.", "He's not. And i promise it's not an mlm.", "I mean, like, he has no issue with me going out, staying in, whatever. He attempts no control over my freedom of movement.", "We don't argue about the big things. It's only ever small things and when he's upset he can be cruel and then shuts down all communication. Like, there's never a discussion about how we feel. It's, I say something that he decides he doesn't like and makes it into a fight when one wasn't necessary.", "I have literally no idea. I thought it was weird, too.", "I am getting the feeling the other husband has the same attitudes like OP's SO.  \nKind of a Stepford Wives situation.", "I actually might do that if he ever talks to me again.", "it's a little thing called a Significant Difference In Life Experience.", "I know plenlty of women in their 50s and 60s in highly controlling relationships with men the same age. Age doesnt change who you are in the way people try to make out. The difference between a 50 year old and a 30 year old isnt much. Actually 30 would probaly have more confidence and more likely to not be forced as werent raised to obey.", "But it's stupid stuff. It just doesn't make sense.", "It wasn't an option to meet later. The husband wouldn't go if the wife was left at home. So it was either agree or continue to have him ask me.", "So that\u2019s where they all come from!", "Oh, I definitely wouldn't do it again!! This was the first and only time this situation came up for me, and I'm pretty introverted so I'm surprised I went along with it. We were pretty new to the area so I figured the worst that would happen was a few awkward hours and at best I'd make a new friend. I knew my husband would be spending time with him occasionally anyway, so we would've met at one point or another. \n\nBut we weren't expected to cook a meal for them while they were out! I'm uncomfortable cooking in someone else's kitchen or having them cook in mine unless we're very close, so that would have been a nightmare.", "\u201cCan be mean\u201d. Huh.", "How often does he turn the little arguments into big ones? And how does he get \"mean\" in the process? This whole situation seems very strange to me and I don't understand why you're engaged to someone like this.", "Many people save this behavior until after they think they\u2019ve trapped you. It\u2019s not that he actually was the nice guy you knew before, but rather he hid his true behavior and this is your new normal if you stay.", "he was always this way. you\u2019ve even said in another comment he likes the way he is and won\u2019t change. he just didn\u2019t show you how he really acts and thinks until you were in \u201c\u201dtoo deep\u201d so you\u2019ll serve him for life and never leave like a woman is supposed to according to him", "I would recommend you spend some time thinking on this and deciding how to best proceed to ensure you are not a doormat for the rest of your life. Obviously I don\u2019t know how often this happens or how severe it is, but it sounds like he doesn\u2019t really care about your opinions and comfort and if it\u2019s a pattern like you say it is then you may want to reevaluate the relationship", "Oh honey. We're just worried because there's always a good possibility of any new business venture not working out, and if he really believed in it he would have financially supported it so that you would still have a financial cushion if things did go south. \n\nHim encouraging you to invest all your money, but not putting anything towards it except words can be a flag for financial abuse, especially with everything else going on.", "So now you have no money to leave him...", "Yeah but he's controlling you in other ways, many of which are far worse.", "I know you're looking at what you just said to me like \"we hardly fight\" but to me it sounds like you never speak up because he just refuses to have a communicative relationship with you. I try to keep the peace too but the most basic thing my fianc\u00e9 demands of me is to stop hiding when I am upset.", "It is weird! I say dump all these weirdos and enjoy your life!", "Yep wouldn\u2019t surprise me, birds of a feather and all that. Both women should leave them!", "This is a woman with anxiety that is much younger. You don't get more easy to cow than that.", "Yup, it seldom makes sense until you\u2019re out of the situation and can look back on it clearly.\n\nTalk to your therapist.", "it\u2019ll add up", "Well then you never should have agreed in the first place.", "Don't listen to /u/Erthan-1.", "Oh yes the \"go cook together little ladies\" bit is just crazy! Who does that?!", "He wasn't like this at all before we moved in together. Maybe only seeing each other a couple times a week kept it at bay? \n\nHe's mean by telling me I'm not a good person, or telling me I have no friends, or that I have no feelings. And there's no such thing as a little argument. He makes a big one out of a little one. \n\nOverall, the relationship is mostly good. He's supportive, thoughtful (mostly, though like everyone, he can be a bone head sometimes), etc. It's just this one area that he royally sucks at. And I'm at the end of my rope on it.", "Clearly I have some thinking to do.", "You're absolutely right.", "Basically", "We fight about once a month. But it's stupid things that don't even need a fight. I feel like, just because we have a different point of view on simple things, he is always making a mountain out of a molehill.", "I have NO idea! Were they given a set menu or could they cook whatever they wanted? At least on my \"lady date\" we ordered in and had too many drinks lol", "If he tells you that you're not a good person and you have no friends, then your relationship is not \"mostly good\". Absolutely nothing about this makes him sound like a supportive and thoughtful partner. Making every little argument into a big one is not a healthy way to manage disagreements. \n\nAbuse escalates with each step. He was fine when you lived separately and only saw each other a few times a week, it increased when you moved in together, and it's going to increase even more once you're married and it's harder for you to leave. This is not going to get better.", "Oh hon, no. You don\u2019t deserve to be talked to like this. How would you feel if someone told one of your close friends they were a bad person with no feelings? Wouldn\u2019t you get mad on their behalf?\n\nBe your own friend. What your fianc\u00e9e is doing is deeply unkind.", "This sounds extremely abusive and a huge red flag. A loving partner should never say such things, not even in anger. It seems hes showing his true colours, and they aren't pretty. You have the right to your own opinions and decisions, and you don't have to agree with him", "This is not something at age 50 that he will grow out of - it is ingrained behavior. It will only get worse going forward as he gets older and the relationship gets more entrenched.", "I would say so, its seems like this behavior will only get worse. Shitty things happen in life, but being in an abusive marriage should not be one.", "if that\u2019s the life you want then enjoy but id personally would be making plans to separate myself from that toxicity. i\u2019m not here to Serve anyone but myself. a relationship is a partnership", "Not great. Do you have a place to go if you wanted to leave him? Family? Do you have income?", "it sounds like what you are saying is, he stonewalls you regularly and if he cannot stonewall, he floods you. Read this and see if it sounds like what you're telling me:\n\nStonewalling or flooding is defined by withdrawing from the relationship as a way to avoid conflict. It is a way to self protect and prevents you from being able to take in the information that the speaker is trying to tell you. You may think you are trying to be \u201cneutral\u201d but stonewalling conveys disapproval, icy distance, separation, disconnection, and/or smugness. While flooding involves feeling like your drowning in emotions. You may stonewall in order not to feel flooded. Unfortunately, both behaviors result in an emotional withdrawal from interaction and you as the listener are not able to give the speaker the usual nonverbal signals that you are tracking the speaker. Flooding or stonewalling may appear as stony silence, monosyllabic mutterings, changing the subject, removing yourself physically , or becoming emotionally dys-regulated. When you feel you have disconnected from the person speaking it is an important time for you to stop the conversation, check your heart rate, and self-soothe until you can become grounded in the present moment once again.", "It might be a good exercise to think about how much you would fight if you actually felt comfortable speaking your mind and/or having an opinion.", "Once a month is once a month too many...", "We were allowed to cook whatever we wanted. Lol", "Family is hundreds of miles away. No income from the business yet, but getting there.", "Very much. Thank you.", "Never. He initiates the fights. They don't need to be but he turns it around and then blows it up."]}
