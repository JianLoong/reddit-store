She said yes.\n\nBUT, when we went to the bank, she actually made a request for 6,000$ !!!!! I was shocked and kept hysterically begging her not to do this. She was carrying 6k all in cash and going to meet this guy. She got tired of me pushing and yelled at me to leave her alone and that she changed her mind about me tagging along. \n\nShe then just went ahead and hailed a taxi, I hurriedly went and blocked the door and begged the taxi driver to also take me with her, I told him she was irrational and didn't know what she was doing. I ended up going into the taxi with her. On the way there, I called my bro and mom and told them what's going on. My bro said he was coming and I shared our live location with him.\n\nMy sister was absolutely mad and said I was horrible for doing this to her when I know how much she hates both mom and bro and doesn't trust them. She also said I had no right to interfere even if she was scammed or harmed. \n\nShe then stopped the taxi and ran out and growled at me not to follow. I ignored her and kept following when my bro in his car honked at us. We both turned back and when I looked back again, my sister had started running while he got down from the car and we both chased after her. In the end, we caught up. My bro told her he'll be following her all the time until he sees this guy and he will get him to back off.\n\nMy sister just broke down in tears called us all fucking nuts. That she won't be going anywhere and to just leave her alone. We insisted she comes home right away which she did. She went to her room and slammed the door at my face and wouldn't talk to me ever since.\n\nMy mom said she will understand in time when she matures how big of a favor I did her and not to worry. But her reaction still ate at me and I'm not sure if I really did the right thing.

You are right, this was 110% a scam. Hopefully she will realize some day that you did her a favor. It might take a while, though.", "NTA. I am sure your parents set that money up to be used for college, not to give to a guy. I am up for learning mistakes on your own. But that's a big mistake. I think you made the right choice.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is young and naive and you prevented her getting ripped of and not just like 50 bucks or something like that where it would be an okay price for her to learn a lesson no we are talking 6k here.\n\nShe probably will be grateful once she gets older but in the meantime keep your eyes open if she wants to meet up with this guy again.", "NTA.  That was an intervention if I've ever heard of one!  It was as if she had taken a temporary leave of sanity - good on you for doing something like this as it couldn't have been easy.  Her college money needs to be put in a safe place where she can't access it so easily.", "NTA! \nEven if it isn\u2019t a scam, you just don\u2019t give the money your parents saved for to someone else. \nRight now this boy is manipulating her and she won\u2019t see that she is wrong. Your mom is right, in the end she will see", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing\n\nHopefully some safeguards can be put in place before sis gets scammed out of the rest and can\u2019t go to college.", "I promise she will be grateful to you in the future once her head is cleared and this loser is out of her life. I wish my 3 sisters cared half as much as you do. NTA.", "NTA\nShe could've been raped, assaulted, or killed. It is stupid of her to give a complete stranger money the first time she meets him and not to go with anyone else.\n\nI met my husband online almost 22 years ago at 17 so I think I am speaking from enough experience. We met in a public place and he obviously did not give me creeper vibes but even still I knew enough back then not to be giving him money or bringing large amounts of money and to meet him with others around.\n\nYour sister sounds emotionally immature and also easily manipulated.", "Lol NTA\n\nShe'll learn and understand when the guy stops talking to her when she's not a financial pipeline for him. You did the right thing. I would also recommend getting that college fund set up so only your mother can withdraw money or do anything with it. That money is there for her education, not to give away to random guys.", "NTA.  Your sister fell for a scam involving someone she hadn't even met f2f. You and your bother may have saved her not just from losing a pile of money but also from getting physically assaulted.", "NTA.  You did the right thing. \n\nPerhaps it was unwise for whomever set up her college fund to give her access to the money.", "Nta you\u2019re the mvp.", "NTA, you saved your sister's money and in the future she will hopefully see you acted in her best interest.  She most likely is in denial since she thinks she has been speaking to someone who thinks she loves and how could someone who loves her tell her to do the wrong thing.  She wants to believe she was doing the right thing and its hard to admit you sunk time and energy into a lie.  Good Luck and hopefully she can come out of it with all her money in tact.", "NTA. Give it time and she will thank you for saving her all that money. It technically wasn't even hers to give away like that, it was specifically to pay for college.", "NTA for having your family's back!", "NTA. If they'd just agreed to meet up for coffee irl and you'd acted with this amount of intervention, that'd be one thing, but nobody asks an online SO to come packed with 6 grand the very first time they meet up in person. This fish stank for a reason and you acted with a completely appropriate amount of concern for your sister. Had you let her go and something terrible had happened, you'd have never forgiven yourself for not trusting your instincts.   \n\n\nIt can sometimes feel like a cold comfort, but know that you did the right thing. Hopefully she'll come to see that soon.", "Good job, sis!!! NAH, except for that guy.", "Huuuuuuuge NTA.\n\nWhat you did was amazing and way more than most people would do. You are a wonderful sister, and even if she doesn't see it right now, she should be grateful to you.\n\nSometimes doing the right thing is hard. This is one of those. You should be very proud of yourself.", "NTA - You are 100% a kick ass little sister!!!!  Women, young and old, get scammed in online romances all of the time.  If you had not intervened, she would continue to be scammed.  You saved your sister's college fund.  In time, she will thank you.", "NTA. No matter the outcome, you did what a caring sister would. I hope she does understand one day that you did her a huge favor though.", "NTA, your sisters sounds very vulnerable and needs protecting", "NTA. She seems idiotic, maybe next time just let her be. If she wants to give thousands to strangers, she can", "You are ABSOLUTELY NTA.    \n\n\nBut this level of delusion.  Either your sister is a few bulbs short of a full holiday tree, or she might be experiencing a mental health crisis.      \n\n\nThis isn't over.    She needs....something.

Scam or no, you did the right thing.", "You did the right thing, NTA. \n\nYour mom is absolutely correct, in time she will understand.", "NTA \n\nYou did well! \ud83d\ude4c\n\nBut what will stop her from this in the future? How did she fall for this guy so deeply? This is concerning! Has she seen reason yet and forgiven you all? This may happen again. \n\nPlease find some stories of these things happening to women in the news. Share some stories with her and this aita post while present with the family perhaps. She needs to understand this is a common occurrence and she was in danger. \n\nI hope she can come to terms.", "This is one of those cases of a justified AH. chasing someone around the city, harassing her, calling someone she hates to help... bit over the top. Kinda scary.  You say it's her money since she turned 18. Mistake to not keep it in a trust instead of a regular bank account, but that's your parents' fault, not hers or yours. \n\nLikely your mom is right, and she'll thank you for saving the money someday, I just doubt it'll be soon after the scene that was caused in order to do it. \n\nNAH for me.", "ESH. Your sister is naive and negligent and was ready to waste your mom's hard earned money. But that does not justify stalking her, chasing her around, and attempting to physically stop her from exercising her freedoms. It would be really hard to let somebody close to me make a mistake like this, so I understand where you are coming from. But imagine how intimidating and controlling it must feel from her POV.", "YTA. It doesn't matter where that money comes from, it's under your SISTER's name now, which means hers to do with whatever she wants. She hates your brother and mother for a reason and apparently controlling AHs could just be it. Maybe if you didn't act so \"hysterical\" she would've trusted you to go with her when she meets him. Now, you just let her know she's under the radar and she could rebel even more and make a bigger mistake.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
