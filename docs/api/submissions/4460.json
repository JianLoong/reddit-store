But people with different beliefs could use the fact that we accept this sort of behavior to justify using the same kind of force and tactics to do all sorts of things to people \"for their own good\" Idk.

While it may not have been the most tactful way of handling the situation, your intentions were likely good. However, it is important to remember that your sister is an adult and has the right to make her own decisions, even if you disagree with them. It may be helpful for you to talk to her and try to understand her perspective, while also expressing your concern for her wellbeing. It is also important to respect her boundaries and not try to control her actions. It may take time for her to forgive you and trust you again, but continuing to communicate and show her that you care about her will be important in rebuilding that trust.
