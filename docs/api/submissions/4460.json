A one-off scenario is not the same as the situations you listed.\n\nAnd as a middle aged person I\u2019m gonna argue all day that 19 while a legal adult has the mind and life experience of a child. Your brain doesn\u2019t finish developing until 25. Doesn\u2019t mean you can control them but you are equating a specific family situation to the oppression of all women in Islamic countries.

I'm 25 and I barely feel like an adult.\n\nBut if we're going to justify treating 20 year olds as children, then they shouldn't be legal adults. I mean, I would hear out an argument on that grounds tbh, I agree that people continue to be too immature. They still commit most violent crime, cause most car accidents, take irresponsible loans, etc. But if we're going to have a society where we agreed that 20yos have legal freedoms of adults, then we should treat them that way, regardless of our opinion of maturity of their actions.\n\nI don't know, I just know that once you start justifying things like this, doing things to people \"for their own good\" it may lead to all sorts of bad. I feel like this was ultimately a good thing because OP has their had on straight and doesn't seem controlling otherwise and stuff. But people with different beliefs could use the fact that we accept this sort of behavior to justify using the same kind of force and tactics to do all sorts of things to people \"for their own good\" Idk. For example, a parent of a trans kid could lock them up and not allow them to seek medical transition because they believe that it is mutilation and self-harm and that they are just brainwashed or have a mental issue and say that that's just them protecting their family from self-harm.\n\nI just believe in consistently granting people rights and applying legal principles. I don't think it's okay to deny her freedom of movement and association for her own good, even if I agree that here it was for her own good, because I'm aware that different people may have different strongly held beliefs of what \"for her own good\" means and may then feel justified in using force we don't normally allow to achieve that."]}
