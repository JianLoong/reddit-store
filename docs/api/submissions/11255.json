The full programme: mom, dad, brothers, grandparents, uncles and so on. \nHe\u2019s very family oriented and plans on having kids one day. \n\nI on the other hand have never been that close to my family and have drifted even more apart in the last couple of years due to racist comments towards my then boyfriend. (I\u2019m white and he\u2019s Asian)  \n\nThe comments mainly came from my fathers side of the family, but my mom and sister stuck up for me. \n\nI never told him about the comments or the arguments I had with my family over him and our relationship and he\u2019s only ever met my younger sister.\n\nLately he\u2019s been pressing me to meet my family since we\u2019re about to get married. I\u2019ve tried to tell him no a couple of times in a quiet and civilised manner but he keeps on pressing the topic. \n\nToday he pressed it so much that I snapped and told him that part of my family is racist and that I will not be introducing him to them just so they can pick a fight. \n\nHe was taken aback and the conversation died. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: he knew about the issues in the family and the conservative views my dads family shares. He just didn\u2019t know about the racist comments about HIM. He only ever knew they weren\u2019t very fond of him which is also what I thought before  my sister told me about some of the comments. \n\nI\u2019ve told him to not press the topical any more since we wouldn\u2019t be met with love if we tried introducing them, before he pressed it until I snapped.\n\n\nUpdate: I\u2019ll take the YTA because my communications skills could have been FAR more better even though I only wanted him to not be treated by my family like I was growing up. \n\nOn another note y\u2019all had me asking if he still wants to marry me. And lucky for me he still does. \nHe also isn\u2019t mad. to my surprise he was more concerned about what my family did to me??? \nWe\u2019ve talked for only a little bit since I have to go to work but agreed on sitting down and talking things through so he can get answers. \n\nSo yeah I\u2019ll take the Criticism and work on my communication skills and also try and introduce him to the rest of the family at a dinner or bbq.", "created_utc": 1677725131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fqkut/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_he_will_never_meet_my/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His request was reasonable, and your reason for staying away is reasonable.  What isn't reasonable is that he was never informed as to why he wasn't being introduced to them.  Communication is key in any healthy relationship.", "YTA.  Not for not wanting to introduce to your family but for your piss poor communication skills.  You\u2019ve been with this person for 7 years, he deserves to know what he is getting into and what type of family you have.  YTA for also snapping at him for asking to meet your family.  Just communicate properly instead of trying to hide things", "YTA.\n\nYou could've just been honest and communicated this from the start. No need to snap at him.", "Not an ass for telling him he will never meet your family, but YTA for hiding this huge secret from him and snapping at him about it.\n\nHe deserved to know the truth from the get go. You should have never hid it from him, especially after seven years. Of course he pressed, it\u2019s suspicious af.\n\nHonestly, if my partner refused to let me meet their family for years but refused to say why to any degree, I\u2019d probably end things. Family is very important to some people. \n\nAlso if your sister and mom aren\u2019t racist and stuck up for you, why couldn\u2019t he have at least had a relationship with them?", "soft YTA he is your partner, he loves you & wants to know more about you. It was be best to just tell him rather than let this drive a wedge between you guys. I mean if you plan on spending you life with them don\u2019t they deserve the truth?", "A mild YTA.\n\nYou care about him, and don't want to see him hurt or treated badly by your relatives. This is good. Unfortunately, the effort to protect him is wrong. You're treating him like a child.\n\nHe's going to meet your family sooner or later. There will be a wedding or funeral at which he will encounter them. Yes, there might well be some racist comments or other unpleasant talk. If he meets your family now, he can prepare for it. He won't be taken off-guard by one of them crashing your wedding or being rude AF at someone's funeral.", "YTA, but lightly.  I get where you're coming from, but it's pretty weird to be actively withheld from meeting your spouse's family.  It sounds like you're trying to protect him, but he's a big boy.  Just give him the facts and let him make the decision of whether that's something he wants to deal with.\n\nI don't think you're being sinister, but rather immature.", "YTA\n\nNot for not introducing them. But, you're the one who chose to not tell him why you didn't want them to meet. It's perfectly reasonable that, if you had a relationship with them when you started dating, and still have some relationship with them now, he'd not only want to meet them, but get upset that you wouldn't introduce him.\n\nYou had no right to yell at him over your choice to not explain the situation to him.", "YTA for not telling him long ago why you\u2019re not close to your family and that he\u2019ll never meet them. He could have been a source of support all this time.", "YTA- gentle though because I hope you were just trying to spare his feelings or maybe you were embarrassed by the racists in your family. But if you're getting married, that person should be the person you can talk to about everything: how awful your dad's family is, the embarrassing thing you did in 6th grade, or hollering to them when you need more toilet paper. Especially if you're getting married, the wedding guest list is going to come up and you're going to have to make some decisions that will possibly affect your relationship with some family members going forward. Do you want any relationship with your dad and his family, or do you want to go no contact? Will your mom support your decisions or will she pressure you to invite people you don't want to? I'm assuming you had other reasons to drift away from your family before this, so you may benefit from therapy to sort some of this out. Your fiance deserves an open and honest discussion about your family, and if you've been together that long then you might find he is a good sounding board as you sort this all out.", "NAH\n\nI totally understand why you didn\u2019t want to tell your fianc\u00e9 why you weren\u2019t introducing him to your family.\n\nI also understand why he\u2019d press for an introduction if you hadn\u2019t shared your reasons for not introducing them.\n\nThe only AHs in this story are the racists.", "Yta\n\nIn your zeal to protect him you attack him! He doesn't understand why you don't introduce him to your family because you are so secretive, for all he knows he might think you are ashamed of him.", "You\u2019re NTA but you were definitely in the wrong. You\u2019re planning on marrying this man and you\u2019ve kept this from him for 7 years? You\u2019ve got to be more open then that if this marriage is going to work", "YTA", "Mild YTA.  I mean, he's gotta meet the family at some point ..\n\nFair game to establish some ground rules for everyone.  He shouldn't go in looking for a fight, but he also shouldn't be forced to listen to racist abuse.", "Why can\u2019t he meet your mom and sister?", "NTA. People are so shitty when your family sucks. You said no, he pushed it, he didn't respect what you had said many times before, and he can't be upset that you finally snapped.", "I keep flitting between NAH (except the racists on your dad's side) because I totally get both sides, i.e why you'd want to hide the truth from him & why he's so insistent on meeting your family, & (a really light/soft) YTA because he deserves to know the truth; how would you feel if you found out he was keeping secrets of these proportions from you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Please don't take the comments to heart about what you should or should not have done. I have a completely crap family and I've talked to people until I'm blue in the face about it and it just goes in one ear and out the other. It's a form of victim blaming.

The relationship was cracked far before I met him, due to various reasons.

Why did it take you snapping to reveal the truth?", "I think you are shadow banned because your newest comments aren't showing up here.\n\nAlso, you keep contradicting yourself. If I were you, I'd apologize for snapping at him.
