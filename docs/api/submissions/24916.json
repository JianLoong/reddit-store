My sister (30f) and her daughter just left a really bad relationship and needed somewhere to stay to get back on their feet. I asked him several times over the course of a week. Just checking his temp on how he still felt about it. He assured me at least 3 times that no matter what, she and my niece could stay with us.\n\nI was worried bc he had still never met my sister in person. Just spoken to her over the phone. Well, they recently met in person and my boyfriend did not have the best time. Apparently he tried to have several conversations with my sister that led to her telling him that he was over reacting to her situation and why she was leaving her husband. She later told me she felt like my boyfriend treated her like a child. Like every decision she made was wrong or bad unless it was his suggestion. My boyfriend seemed to think my sister is too stubborn to help. That's when he retracted his offer for her to stay. He feels that she will put us in danger, though she has never put me in danger before. And that she will need too much therapy. He also feared that we would have to take care of her daughter more than her. \nIt broke my heart and hers bc he had promised nothing would change his mind. Now my sister is facing eviction bc she has not been allowed to work for 4 years and is struggling to find a job now. Plus has a 2yo baby that's not old enough for most free daycare or preschools in her area. We don't know what she will do.\n\nOnly days after my boyfriend changing his mind. He mentions his friend is coming to town and will need somewhere to stay for when she is here. They have a sexual past and she also does not like me. And she's supposed to stay for 2 weeks. I told my boyfriend no. That we had an opportunity to help someone who really needed it and that he ripped away her haven bc he didn't like how little she will listen to him. But his bestie who he has mentioned is hot, who he has slept with while she was dating someone years ago, and who does not like me can stay in my home. Knowing that she makes me uncomfortable and knowing how I feel about her as a person. \n\nHe said it's different because his friend doesn't need as much help. I said I know bc his friend is loaded and could easily get a hotel or air bnb. There is no reason she has to stay here which is why I'm saying no. \n\nHe thinks that I am retaliating against his decision. Honestly if it was any other person I would have hesitantly said ok. But the fact it is her, and she makes it known how she doesn't like me by flat out ignoring me half the time. It changes it for me. Of all people it had to be her over my sister? \n\nStill I try to be self aware and if I am TA then I will of course apologize. But am I wrong for not wanting his little bestie here after he changed his mind about my sister?", "created_utc": 1692350961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ufmor/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriends_friends_to/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Before I agreed to anything I'd need to meet her and hang out with her for awhile.\n\nDid you guys have any sort of discussion on how long she'd be staying or what the expectations would be?

But besides that, to me it seemed like she only wanted to vent about her situation to my boyfriend and my boyfriend wasn't listening, and instead was just throwing solutions at her. I've been in her position before. Running from a bad relationship. It's not always as simple as how my boyfriend was making it out to be. My sister tried explain but ultimately he was frustrated and just wanted to be done with the situation. I think the most hurtful part is that I warned and spoke with him several times.

This is the first time he has ever really given me a hard NO no matter what. \n\nMy sister could not work because her ex husband would not allow her to. He was extremely insecure and accused her of cheating if she had a job. He'd purposely get her fired by calling her jobs, and he would sabotage her efforts to keep a job by making sure their work schedules overlapped and it would be difficult for her to work without someone home with the baby.\n\nNow that she is away from him with a protective order, she wants to work, but she has little experience in my fields other than car detailing.

Something that I've never really seen in him before. We have been together for 3 years and this is the first major disagreement.", "I completely see this. Which is why I had been checking his temp all week. I knew that without him ever meeting her it would be hard to promise something so big. He literally took me by the hands and said \"we are helping your sister and that's the end of that conversation. We will be there\" \n\nAlso you are right, I am a little annoyed with my sister bc my boyfriend is not wrong, she's one of the most hard headed people I know. And I wish she would have just played a little nicer. But if she doesn't agree with what is being said, she will give you an earful. \n\nIt's not that I don't see where he is coming from in a way. I do. But to me it's such a small thing that could be talked out that it seems unreasonable that over a couple conversations, she can no longer get help from us.\n\nWe did have an agreement that my sister and I created where the first thing we do is her driving license, then she can do doordash for a bit while she applied to other jobs. I also work in recruitment and was given the ok for me to hire her for one of our roles that tends to stay open this time of year. She would stay for no more than 5 months, and would have her own place. By month 6. With the money we expected to have coming in, she could save for a new place, and we could all collectively help with child care since I also have a daughter who is 6.

Another time she had a job that was secret. But when he found out it was so bad the cops had to come and arrest him for DV. She's had a pretty rough go these past 4 years. \n\nThirdly, I know it appears as though my boyfriend wants his fuck buddy to stay over, however, I would not be with him if I didn't trust him. He never cheated on me with her as it was years before we ever met. But she is flirty by nature and since the do have a past it makes me uncomfortable. I trust that he's not going to do anything with her but I don't trust that she wouldn't be flirty in my home while she doesn't like me. Hell no. And in a way, me and his friend have a non verbal agreement lol we know we don't like each other at this point. So idk why she felt the need to ask to stay when she can afford to get a hotel.

You really need to rethink your relationship to a man who thinks this way.", "That can't be true. He has an ex sexual partner who treats you poorly enough you aware she hates you and he has 1. Put you around her enough for you to be aware she hates you 2. Told you she was staying in your home.\n\nSounds like just the two things alone shows the last 3 years haven't been so great and this can't be \"the first major disagreement\" AND if it is this shows you have not stood up for yourself in order to keep things so so soooo great.", "See this gets dicey for me because you said she wasn't allowed to work, doesn't have her licesen, I assume she doesn't have any money or very little.\n\nWhich implies all these costs have to come out from somewhere else. Two extra mouths to feed, licesens aren't free, the tests aren't free.\n\nI understand where you're coming from because I told my sister her and my niece and nephew could live with me any time they wanted, but they also have their own dedicated rooms in the house.\n\nI'm sorry I can't offer more advice, you're in a very difficult spot.", ">First of all LOVE the breakdown lol, it made me giggle at a time where all I've done is cry the past few days so thank you for that.\n\nI often do try to keep this format for my comments in AITA, except when it's clearly obvious that someone is the AH.\n\n>Secondly, my sister has not worked bc her ex would not allow her to.

Sister's husband was violent against her.\n\n>Thirdly, I know it appears as though my boyfriend wants his fuck buddy to stay over, however, I would not be with him if I didn't trust him.\n\nI know you trust him, otherwise you wouldn't be with him. But that situation seems awkward, to say the least. His friend, who has a past with him, decides to come over for two weeks because she is in your country, and appears to be flirty. Even if you trust him, that really paints this friend as \"more than his friend\" to me.\n\nI wonder how your husband reacted to your (justified) refusal...", "I LOVE THIS.\n\nYou trust him so so so much that he let's his ex fuck treat you poorly AND he still makes you be around her to the point he told you she is staying there! \n\nIt so great you trust him how else would he treat you badly?"]}
