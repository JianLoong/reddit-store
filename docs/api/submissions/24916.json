{"id": 24916, "submission_id": "15ufmor", "title": "AITA for not wanting my boyfriends friends to stay at our apt bc he won't let my sister stay.", "selftext": "My (29f) boyfriend (34m) and I have recently gotten into an argument over my sister being able to stay with us. My sister (30f) and her daughter just left a really bad relationship and needed somewhere to stay to get back on their feet. I asked him several times over the course of a week. Just checking his temp on how he still felt about it. He assured me at least 3 times that no matter what, she and my niece could stay with us.\n\nI was worried bc he had still never met my sister in person. Just spoken to her over the phone. Well, they recently met in person and my boyfriend did not have the best time. Apparently he tried to have several conversations with my sister that led to her telling him that he was over reacting to her situation and why she was leaving her husband. She later told me she felt like my boyfriend treated her like a child. Like every decision she made was wrong or bad unless it was his suggestion. My boyfriend seemed to think my sister is too stubborn to help. That's when he retracted his offer for her to stay. He feels that she will put us in danger, though she has never put me in danger before. And that she will need too much therapy. He also feared that we would have to take care of her daughter more than her. \nIt broke my heart and hers bc he had promised nothing would change his mind. Now my sister is facing eviction bc she has not been allowed to work for 4 years and is struggling to find a job now. Plus has a 2yo baby that's not old enough for most free daycare or preschools in her area. We don't know what she will do.\n\nOnly days after my boyfriend changing his mind. He mentions his friend is coming to town and will need somewhere to stay for when she is here. They have a sexual past and she also does not like me. And she's supposed to stay for 2 weeks. I told my boyfriend no. That we had an opportunity to help someone who really needed it and that he ripped away her haven bc he didn't like how little she will listen to him. But his bestie who he has mentioned is hot, who he has slept with while she was dating someone years ago, and who does not like me can stay in my home. Knowing that she makes me uncomfortable and knowing how I feel about her as a person. \n\nHe said it's different because his friend doesn't need as much help. I said I know bc his friend is loaded and could easily get a hotel or air bnb. There is no reason she has to stay here which is why I'm saying no. \n\nHe thinks that I am retaliating against his decision. Honestly if it was any other person I would have hesitantly said ok. But the fact it is her, and she makes it known how she doesn't like me by flat out ignoring me half the time. It changes it for me. Of all people it had to be her over my sister? \n\nStill I try to be self aware and if I am TA then I will of course apologize. But am I wrong for not wanting his little bestie here after he changed his mind about my sister?\n\nEdit: as I was reading your comments my boyfriend approached me to talk about the matter further. And as I am typing this I am crying because I now know that he was right in his decision. But wrong for keeping this information from me. First and foremost, his little friend is not staying with us. There seemed to be confusion that I was just gonna go with that. Hell nahh. But further more he was keeping key info FROM ME as to why he changed his mind bc he didn't want to hurt my feelings. Apparently it wasn't just about the suggestions, and convos about her stuff and safety. While I was out grabbing food for us he saw her in her room do a line of some substance. I DID NOT BELIEVE HIM AT FIRST quite literally told him to prove it to me then. And he showed me pictures he snuck of the drawer later that day..  I honestly don't know what to say... she's been sober for 7 months. But how long has she been lying to me about this..  I still don't know if I fully believe it. He's saying that there biggest argument was over him seeing her do that and her doubling down and saying it was fine and he didn't know anything. She does have a past with drug use but up until 20min ago, I thought she'd been clean for months... she hasn't acted differently... fuck.\n\nEdit: there are some people who feel like I was misleading by me calling her my sister because she is not a blood relative. Her parents lost custody of her when she was 12 and my parents took her in. Since that day my entire family has referred to her as daughter, sister (I have other bio sisters), niece, cousin. I was accused of trying to mislead with the term sister. However, I just dont consider her a best friend at this point. She's been my sister since I was 11 and I've never referred to her as a best friend. If this changes your stance on things that's understandable though.

He was extremely insecure and accused her of cheating if she had a job.

I also work in recruitment and was given the ok for me to hire her for one of our roles that tends to stay open this time of year.

Two extra mouths to feed, licesens aren't free, the tests aren't free.\n\nI understand where you're coming from because I told my sister her and my niece and nephew could live with me any time they wanted, but they also have their own dedicated rooms in the house.\n\nI'm sorry I can't offer more advice, you're in a very difficult spot.", ">First of all LOVE the breakdown lol, it made me giggle at a time where all I've done is cry the past few days so thank you for that.\n\nI often do try to keep this format for my comments in AITA, except when it's clearly obvious that someone is the AH.\n\n>Secondly, my sister has not worked bc her ex would not allow her to.

Sister's husband was violent against her.\n\n>Thirdly, I know it appears as though my boyfriend wants his fuck buddy to stay over, however, I would not be with him if I didn't trust him.\n\nI know you trust him, otherwise you wouldn't be with him. But that situation seems awkward, to say the least. His friend, who has a past with him, decides to come over for two weeks because she is in your country, and appears to be flirty. Even if you trust him, that really paints this friend as \"more than his friend\" to me.\n\nI wonder how your husband reacted to your (justified) refusal...", "I LOVE THIS.\n\nYou trust him so so so much that he let's his ex fuck treat you poorly AND he still makes you be around her to the point he told you she is staying there! \n\nIt so great you trust him how else would he treat you badly?", "INFO - is this the same [\"sister\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pabkne/comment/ha3h7qz/) who is actually your best friend (not blood related), who has had a history of drug abuse, severe mental health problems and poor decision making, who has had previous kids taken away from her? If it is, I would be hesitant to allow her to live in my house too. \n\nThat being said, your BF is a total AH for wanting his rude (ex?)fuckbuddy to stay with you two for even a night. \n\nI think these are two seperate issues.

Hmmm I\u2019d say it wasn\u2019t too unreasonable for him to turn down your sister staying with you as he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with it happening (it\u2019s his home too), didn\u2019t get along with her (although we\u2019d need more info on what their convo actually was to decide who was being unreasonable between your bf and sister), and is probably concerned about her mental health(considering she has other issues which you mentioned in the comments). \n\nHowever, I\u2019d be really concerned that he doesn\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t want one of his ex flings staying at his house?

She is an abused wife who needs a place to stay. Your boyfriend starts off being extremely sympathetic but all of that suddenly changes. This is where we lack sufficient information and I believe he may have as well when he initially agreed to letting her stay. You said in an add-on that the police had to be called.

This is evidenced by the change to no and then letting you know his friend was coming to town along with you initially having to verify multiple times that his yes was a yes. You need to ask yourself if this relationship is something that will benefit you in the future, or will he stay until something better for him comes along.

He was far more nervous than the rest of us that her ex would show up while we were packing. And because my sisters sense of urgency was slightly clouded by her recent traumatic experience with her ex, she was taking too long in his eyes to get her stuff together.\n\nHere is where I can slightly see where he is coming from. It took us 3 days to get her packed up because she didn't want to leave certain pieces of furniture and decorations that were important to her. Because it took so long each day we ran the risk of her ex coming back since he still had access to the apt. \n\nHe felt like she wasn't taking her own safety seriously enough. However, I recognized that she was safe with 4 people (one of her friends were there helping too) in her home with her, and that she's not going to think as clearly as the rest of us.

She later told me she felt like my boyfriend treated her like a child.\n\nOverreacting to her being in a abusive relationship with her husband and the dangers of leaving that relationship which often result in violence or even death if the abuser catches their victim?\n\nYour BF is not treating her like a child for taking the situation extremely seriously but your sister is acting very immature if she is downplaying the risk she and her daughter faces.\n\nMore Relevant Quotes:\n\n>That's when he retracted his offer for her to stay.

Plus has a 2yo baby that's not old enough for most free daycare or preschools in her area.\n\nYour BF is right to worry about his and your safety as your sister is not taking the abuse seriously and if she is not taking it seriously that could bring the EX to your front door, furthermore you say your sister is jobless, cannot afford rent or childcare.\n\nSo who is going to pay for food, clothes, phone bills, additional utility bills cost etc in the interim? and for how long? also who is going to take care of the 2yo when your sister gets a job? you OP? your BF?\n\nAnother Relevant Quote:\n\n>I told my boyfriend no. That we had an opportunity to help someone who really needed it and that he ripped away her haven bc he didn't like how little she will listen to him.\n\nNo OP, your BF retracted the offer after your sister kept ranting instead of helping, refusing to communicate with your BF while he is trying to talk to her about how to get everything done i.e, PACK HER STUFF UP, then she says he is treating like a child for taking the abuse seriously?\n\nAnd you mention ZERO PLANS on how you are going to afford to house your sister and your niece, how long this 'Stay' will last, who will take care of 2yo while sister job hunts / works and you plainly admit in the last relevant quote that you said no because he retracted the offer after it became blatantly aware their was no plans for what happens next.\n\nSo here is my question to you OP, since your sister keeps downplaying the abuse that occurred, was she actually being abused or is that something that she made up with or without you so your BF would take her in and your niece then be on the hook for the indefinite future to pay for while she divorces her husband?\n\nI believe your sister wants to leave her husband but after reading everything you said and your sisters attitude to the situation, their lack thereof concern regarding the EX that the situation is not as she claimed it to be or you made it out to be to your BF it is that or she is plainly ignorant to the dangers of a abusive ex-partner.\n\nI'll be happy to amend my vote if you can provide more details.\n\nETA: Another Relevant Quote:\n\n>We did have an agreement that my sister and I created where the first thing we do is her driving license, then she can do doordash for a bit while she applied to other jobs.

Why would he hide that, especially after it made him look like such a jerk. He was given time to fabricate evidence. Time stamps on photos are super easy to alter.  \n\n\nRegardless, NTA for not letting the ex stay with you.", "He's lying.\n\nIt's very convenient that he suddenly found your sister doing drugs right when his hot former side piece wants to stay.\n\nWere the photos of your sister doing drugs? Or did he take a picture of a drawer in the house with a baggie of baby powder that he put in there?", "NTA \n\n>But further more he was keeping key info FROM ME\n\nI find this kind of convenient on his part.  She refuses his bestie staying, and suddenly \"oh I kept the info that I saw drugs and just happened to be able to snap a picture.\"  Colour me cynical, but I would be looking to see if the same picture is on Google search.\n\nYes, sister has a history, BUT she saw no signs of her sister relapsing, and as an addicts sister, I assume she would know the signs,\n\nSorry but I think he's gaslighting her so he can have his hot bestie,  who doesn't like OP stay.", "NTA", "Unpopular opinion....\n\nYTA and he is too. \n\nShould he help your sister and niece? Probably. But I've been down that road where you don't know how long someone is going to be there and as you said, financially she has nothing. So it means supporting 2 human beings extra then you are used to. \n\nNow he should know better to bring an ex(or someone he had sex with) into the home without your consent. But she has her own money, and will be there 2 weeks. So there is a time limit on her stay compared to your sister's stay.\n\nYour both TA but him more so.", "NTA but your boyfriend sounds very emotionally immature", "Sorry hun but he ain't it. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I mean... \n\n>But his bestie who he has mentioned is hot, who he has slept with while she was dating someone years ago, and who does not like me can stay in my home.\n\nHe sounds like a super duper great guy?", "he saw her do drugs", "Read the update, you were Even more right than you thought", "That's fair. Honestly this is the first time I've dealt with someone with a drug issue within my family. She has clearly relapsed but idk how to help if I can at all. I thought 7 months was really really good for what she was abusing... I didn't know there was like a time period where they would still be prone to relapse after the 1st month or so tbh.", "My sister is not pregnant she has a 2yo tho. It's still bad, just not pregnant and addicted bad. I'm not defending her drug use. I didn't know about it until my bf confronted me with this info about an hour ago", "Lol, your right. \n\nMy sister is actually a long time friend of 15 years. We met in middle school and have been friends ever since.", "? She is my sister in my eyes, my parents eyes, and my entire family's eyes. So I fail to see the lies here. I have always only introduced her as my sister. She lived with us since she was 12. I met her when she was 11. Just because she is not a blood relative does not mean she is not my sister by my families choice. My parents took her in when her parents lost custody. So no, I won't just say best friend, that's incredibly insensitive to this situation. She IS my sister... thats like saying if someone has an adopted sibling they are not truly siblings. I have best friends, and then I have my sister. Sorry you consider that lying.", "Yea I definitely do not believe he is a cheater. I wouldn't be with him if I didn't trust him. However, I do think he wants his friend and me to get along and we don't. Mutually we know we do not like each other and are fine with that. I just don't want her in my home if she doesn't like me. Go grab coffee or go hang out somewhere else. But I'll be dammed to feel uncomfortable in my own home.", "I did not find it to be material because as stated I did not believe or know she was using again. There were literally ZERO signs that would have lead me to believe thT. And the only reason I know my bf is being honest is because the picture he has has a very sentimental plate from our childhood that she is using to do her drugs. I would not have invited her to stay if I knew she was using again. Also was not aware that there is some golden time frame where if someone is an addict they can't stay with you until x many months or years..", "Again, I didn't know it was such a big deal that we are not blood related. That's not how our family has operated with her all of these years. However, I can agree that 7 months may not be a long time. I really don't know what would be considered a good time to help someone who is a recovering addict. I now know that she has relapsed somewhere down the road I did not have that information prior to the original post. \n\nNow knowing what I know now that, my bf is clearly NTA to me, however, I still don't feel like I'm the AH for not wanting his friend here for 2 weeks when she makes me uncomfortable in my own home.", "OP posted an update. Her sister is back using drugs and her boyfriend caught her getting high. That's the reason for him changing his mind. A valid reason in my opinion. Definitely he should've been up front about it though.", "after reading OP edits sister is on drugs and refuses to stop doing them which is why he doesn\u2019t want the sister there", "He\u2019s not making his girlfriend\u2019s sister and kid homeless, his girlfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s *poor choices* in life are making her homeless. \n\nThe boyfriend\u2019s NTA. He understands that bringing this woman and her child under his roof can lead to some very serious outcomes.\n\nAt best, he will have to deal with her eventually squatting and obviously won\u2019t be contributing financially towards the roof over their heads, the food they\u2019ll consume and utilities they\u2019ll use. \n\nAt worst, there will be his girlfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s dangerous ex trying to locate them and if he wants to harm them, the OP\u2019s boyfriend is going to be the one expected to take action, resulting in anything up to his possible death. \n\nA lot of people are trying to vilify the OP\u2019s boyfriend, who is making a very rational decision once he had all the facts.", "I thought the same until I read the update. sister is actively using hard drugs and lying to OP.", "he said no because sister is on drugs", "As it turns out, I completely misunderstood addicts. After reading alot of the comments it seems like that was an important part that she had been sober for 7 months. I felt like that was a good thing and thought that meant she was much better and therefore deserved to stay. In fact, her past drug use was a non issue for me bc I had full faith that she would never go back to that. Hence why it really wasn't mentioned in the post. I have an older post where I had to call cps on her over her drug use a couple years ago and since then I've seen her hit rock bottom and come back out better with drug counseling. Maybe I'm incredibly naive to drugs but honestly, I thought 7 months was something to be proud of. What is the right time to offer someone in her shoes help? Obviously she is in the middle of a relapse so I can't help her with living with me anymore. After these comments though I'm really questioning if I should help her at all... will she ever not be an addict then?", "She'd be lightly the AH for not allowing him to change his mind and withdraw his consent after he interacted with the sister firsthand and didn't vibe at all. He has a right to feel comfortable in his house just like she does. \n\nShe's 100% not the AH for anything involving his FWB, for that same reason. She should feel comfortable too, and he should respect when she gives valid reasons for her 'no'. \n\nBut again, I said those seemed like two seperate issues.", "Maybe don't interpret everything in the worst way possible. I understand that you are stressed by both problems. But maybe he wasn't sure if he should tell you in that situation. It's a pretty big finding that your gf's sister does coke.", "I get he lied to you\u2026 but even when he did tell you the truth, you did not believe him until he showed you the prove. you even stated multiple times before you found out that he had a point on his side. Because let\u2019s be honest, if the ex showed up, Your bf was most likely going to have to be the one stand in the middle of this violent man. And hopefully when your sister leaves she leaves for good but we all know that statistically it takes a few times for it to be the last. So him saying she would put you both in danger should have been enough. \n\nIt sounds like this whole situation was emotionally charged and everyone was trying their best to protect the others feeling but in the end it\u2019s just hurting each other.", "Calling her your sister is misleading in this post, people think he was actually refusing a family member of yours, I think a lot would change if you had just called her a very good friend or something less misleading.", "I was under the impression she was pregnant.  My bad on the error there.  That being said she\u2019s the problem.", "It's the effect that this has on the audience (us). Most people place a higher value on a blood relative than a best friend.", "Nice breakdown. You forgot the update.", "I think this is the most important point regarding his bestie: \"But I'll be dammed to feel uncomfortable in my own home.\"  He should not be forcing you to spend time with someone who actively disrespects you. Wtf.", "Speaking as someone with some hard gained personal knowledge of this stuff, most users relapse within the first year - giving you the benefit of the doubt that you genuinely had no idea of this and invited her into your home without reading up on it at all or requiring her to maintain her sobriety through testing or otherwise, you still subjected your BF to an unreasonable risk and hid these facts from him so that he couldn't protect himself either and only found out by catching her - you are definitely TA in this situation.", "Lol. OP edited the post but y\u2019all are HILARIOUS, jumping to all kinds of conclusions", "Ahhhh and THERE is the key info OP was leaving out. As someone who has addicts in the family.... I would never in a million years let one stay with me again. Never.", "Yeah, even though I think OP is right to not allow the friend to stay and I would agree it's a little sus, or at least not appropriate, there's still a difference between even that and the sister/daughter becoming permanent residents essentially. The friend will leave after a couple weeks, the sister definitely will not. In his position I would say no way in hell.", "That's what I thought too, but check the post, OP posted an update that totally justifies her boyfriend's change of mind. From other comments about her other posts, OP's sister has a history of substance abuse, and has again fallen off the wagon. Hence the boyfriend's comment about her being a danger to them", "The funny part is that BF is already a parent for OP\u2019s 6 year old daughter, I guess she left that out in this page.", "It is the same sister. I confirmed it in these comments. The thing is that I do not consider her my long time friend. She has been my sister since we were 11 and 12. Because her parents lost custody and my parents took over via fostering. She has always been considered my sister. In the post I made a while ago I did mention she was a long time friend because that is technically true. However, I have never referred to her as a friend to her face or introducing her to others or discussing her. She is always my sister when I talk about her. I can see how some folks would have a different opinion based on this fact though so I made an edit correcting that she is not a blood relative. Sorry if that was misleading mate. In the moment of typing I was not thinking about explaining how she isn't blood. I had so much to type but I was dancing on the character limit so I've been trying to answer info questions and other comments for clarity.", "Okay look at it this way.  If he's saying the situation isn't as bad then why use the excuse that she could put you in danger?  I thought the situation wasn't that bad?\n\nHe's using double speak and manipulation and yeah like pp's said....he probably is doing this so his former fuck buddy can stay with him...its all above board of course, I mean, why else would he talk about how hot she is in your presence?\n\nOP he's showing you who he is.  Maybe its time to pay attention.", "She is not just a very good friend though, she has lived with me and my parents since she was 12 when her parents lost custody. She have referred to her as daughter, sister, niece and cousin since she began living with us almost 20 years ago. We love and view her as family because she is. I'm not trying to mislead anyone, to me, she is my sister, blood or not. My boyfriend knew too and he knows and considers her my sister as well. It should not matter if we are blood related if everyone in this situation is in agreement that she is our family.", "I get what your saying but im not just picking and choosing when to call her my sister for dramatic effect.. She's been my sister since she was 12 and I don't refer to her as anything but my sibling.", "yeah if an edit ever shows how one sided these posts can be \ud83d\ude02\n\nOP needs to call CPS asap. at least get that kiddo to safety", "And you were wrong.", "Maybe it's time to pay attention to the post... *and the edit*.\n\nFrom the beginning, OP stated that THE SISTER was saying BF was overreacting. That she was minimizing the depth of the situation, saying \"it's not that bad\" so that BF would let them stay.\n\nThen, in the edit, OP revealed that the sister was using hard drugs in their home, and has struggled with addiction for years. And that BF found out. \n\nAnd sister was delaying moving in because she wanted a bunch of stuff, keeping her and the child in danger with a violent abuser and not fleeing when she had the chance.\n\nBut sure, blame the BF for all of this.", "Yeah top suggestion ! Blow off your BF to live with a drug addict who lied to you for months !", "Yeah, fuck that sorry ass! He should invite every relapsed addict to live with him! So toxic!\n\nHehe, so many angry people. So little basis for their anger.", "Y'all. He took a photo *of the drawer*. Not of sis doing drugs. He could've put a baggie of white powder in a drawer in his own home, taken pics, and used them to back up his story.", "I see that explanation.  Still not a good place to be with the boyfriend though where he doesn't explain the real reason (instead making up some BS), then invites his former fuck buddy to stay over, and accuses OP of retaliating when she says no.  Things might have turned out entirely differently if the BF had been honest from the start.  And there's no way I am saying yes to a former fuck buddy staying with me and my SO under any circumstances anyway (and I doubt that's an uncommon sentiment). So bringing up retaliation is a really bad look.  In other words, the sister using drugs doesn't make any of this \"OK\" by the BF.", "It's not just HER house, op said it's in BOTH of THEIR names, and I don't see how her boyfriend is an arsehole because he wants to hurry up and get everything she NEEDS and not a load of stuff that isn't important before her sisters abusive ex gets home, as well as not wanting her druggy sister in THEIR home.", "considering the sisters past and OP believes him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Based on gut feelings alone, I believe this is what happened. I think he's lying about everything.", "TLDR \u201cI was wrong but BF still sucks\u201d", "Not sure what you think I was wrong about.  Boyfriend's communication came across as very controlling.  Shitty communication is shitty communication.  Lying to your SO about important stuff is toxic as fuck.", "And propping up your drug addict friend and her equally drugged out husband while letting them raise a child is what?"]}
