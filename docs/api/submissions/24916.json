My sister (30f) and her daughter just left a really bad relationship and needed somewhere to stay to get back on their feet. I asked him several times over the course of a week. Just checking his temp on how he still felt about it. He assured me at least 3 times that no matter what, she and my niece could stay with us.\n\nI was worried bc he had still never met my sister in person. Just spoken to her over the phone. Well, they recently met in person and my boyfriend did not have the best time. Apparently he tried to have several conversations with my sister that led to her telling him that he was over reacting to her situation and why she was leaving her husband. She later told me she felt like my boyfriend treated her like a child. Like every decision she made was wrong or bad unless it was his suggestion. My boyfriend seemed to think my sister is too stubborn to help. That's when he retracted his offer for her to stay. He feels that she will put us in danger, though she has never put me in danger before. And that she will need too much therapy. He also feared that we would have to take care of her daughter more than her. \nIt broke my heart and hers bc he had promised nothing would change his mind. Now my sister is facing eviction bc she has not been allowed to work for 4 years and is struggling to find a job now. Plus has a 2yo baby that's not old enough for most free daycare or preschools in her area. We don't know what she will do.\n\nOnly days after my boyfriend changing his mind. He mentions his friend is coming to town and will need somewhere to stay for when she is here. They have a sexual past and she also does not like me. And she's supposed to stay for 2 weeks. I told my boyfriend no. That we had an opportunity to help someone who really needed it and that he ripped away her haven bc he didn't like how little she will listen to him. But his bestie who he has mentioned is hot, who he has slept with while she was dating someone years ago, and who does not like me can stay in my home. Knowing that she makes me uncomfortable and knowing how I feel about her as a person. \n\nHe said it's different because his friend doesn't need as much help. I said I know bc his friend is loaded and could easily get a hotel or air bnb. There is no reason she has to stay here which is why I'm saying no. \n\nHe thinks that I am retaliating against his decision. Honestly if it was any other person I would have hesitantly said ok. But the fact it is her, and she makes it known how she doesn't like me by flat out ignoring me half the time. It changes it for me. Of all people it had to be her over my sister? \n\nStill I try to be self aware and if I am TA then I will of course apologize. But am I wrong for not wanting his little bestie here after he changed his mind about my sister?", "created_utc": 1692350961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ufmor/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriends_friends_to/", "score": 711, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But besides that, to me it seemed like she only wanted to vent about her situation to my boyfriend and my boyfriend wasn't listening, and instead was just throwing solutions at her. I've been in her position before. Running from a bad relationship. It's not always as simple as how my boyfriend was making it out to be. My sister tried explain but ultimately he was frustrated and just wanted to be done with the situation. I think the most hurtful part is that I warned and spoke with him several times.

He was extremely insecure and accused her of cheating if she had a job. He'd purposely get her fired by calling her jobs, and he would sabotage her efforts to keep a job by making sure their work schedules overlapped and it would be difficult for her to work without someone home with the baby.\n\nNow that she is away from him with a protective order, she wants to work, but she has little experience in my fields other than car detailing.

We will be there\" \n\nAlso you are right, I am a little annoyed with my sister bc my boyfriend is not wrong, she's one of the most hard headed people I know.

I do. But to me it's such a small thing that could be talked out that it seems unreasonable that over a couple conversations, she can no longer get help from us.\n\nWe did have an agreement that my sister and I created where the first thing we do is her driving license, then she can do doordash for a bit while she applied to other jobs. I also work in recruitment and was given the ok for me to hire her for one of our roles that tends to stay open this time of year. She would stay for no more than 5 months, and would have her own place. By month 6.

She's had a pretty rough go these past 4 years. \n\nThirdly, I know it appears as though my boyfriend wants his fuck buddy to stay over, however, I would not be with him if I didn't trust him. He never cheated on me with her as it was years before we ever met. But she is flirty by nature and since the do have a past it makes me uncomfortable.

You really need to rethink your relationship to a man who thinks this way.", "That can't be true. He has an ex sexual partner who treats you poorly enough you aware she hates you and he has 1. Put you around her enough for you to be aware she hates you 2.

Two extra mouths to feed, licesens aren't free, the tests aren't free.\n\nI understand where you're coming from because I told my sister her and my niece and nephew could live with me any time they wanted, but they also have their own dedicated rooms in the house.\n\nI'm sorry I can't offer more advice, you're in a very difficult spot.", ">First of all LOVE the breakdown lol, it made me giggle at a time where all I've done is cry the past few days so thank you for that.\n\nI often do try to keep this format for my comments in AITA, except when it's clearly obvious that someone is the AH.\n\n>Secondly, my sister has not worked bc her ex would not allow her to.

Which, along with the fact that he mentioned the sister \"putting them in danger\", actually implies the opposite: that the boyfriend is concerned about the degree of abuse that was going on and her ex-husband potentially being violent . . . and the sister, despite leaving her husband, is still downplaying the seriousness of the abuse she was subject to, including being forbidden to work for four years. Which is very common for abuse victims, to continue defending their abusers or insisting it \"wasn't that bad\".\n\nThis is an ESH situation. They should have let the sister stay, but also if she's fleeing domestic violence, she needs to understand that she very well COULD be putting OP and BF in danger, and acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. \n\nAnd regarding the friend, of course she shouldn't be staying with them, but this is also very much retaliatory (note OP referring to her as \"his little friend\" in an incredibly condescending manner). Everyone here is behaving abominably.", "I think you misread. The sister thought the boyfriend was overreacting to her situation. Seems like the sister was underreacting in the boyfriend's eyes.", "Agreed. Boyfriend is a jerk for moving in a former FWB, but I think there are more issues with the sister than she shared. And he\u2019s right about one thing: who will take care of the baby while she\u2019s finding work?\n\nETA: Sister said he\u2019s \u201coverreacting to her situation\u201d. *Her husband was arrested for DV.* She doesn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license, car or job. When trying to form a plan, she \u201cgave him an earful\u201d. I can\u2019t blame him for pulling the plug.", "Maybe there is a chance that you will dump his ass and rent a flat with her?", "why stay in this relationship then?  clearly he doesnt care if someone ends up homeless especially a child too.  and good on your sister for now allowing your bf to tell her what to do. \n\nand fyi its not a coincidence that he doesnt want your sister staying becuase suddenly his friend who he slept with in past is going to stay at your place.  he doesnt care about your boundaries on this or for that matter much else.", "Dump him and get a place with your sister. \n\nThis man does not respect you. If you stay with him, you\u2019ll stop respecting yourself.", "He purposely did this bc he wanted an excuse to kick her out for his other girl friend", "I'm confused when you say it boiled down to him not being able to tell her what to do? What does that mean, what was he trying to control about the situation that she had a problem with? Is he that controlling towards you? Definitely time for you to rethink the relationship regardless though, he's leaving your sister and her child homeless because of his control issues and then turning around and trying to home someone else..... could he be using her \"stubbornness\" as an excuse because he would just rather host his friend?", "Can you give an example of one of his solutions that she rejected?", "He sounds awful. And he doesn\u2019t care about you. It sounds like your sister is leaving an abusive relationship and you are in a toxic one.\n\nLike another poster said \n\n>He purposely did this bc he wanted an excuse to kick her out for his other girl friend", "Well then it's even more of a red flag. He probably changed his mind because his f**ked friend is coming to town and he wants to make space for her instead of helping your sister", "Oh honey, I feel bad for you. It\u2019s not about not trusting him, it\u2019s the fact that his actions are untrustworthy and he\u2019s disregarding the people important to you for someone that he used to fuck on the regular\u2026. And you don\u2019t see that part as the issue? Ay ay ay Godspeed", "WAKE UP. He\u2019s fucking that chick or at least trying to.", "Why are you with someone who will make YOUR sister and a  little baby homeless. Y. t. .A for staying with someone like that. \nNTA for refusing his side piece to live with you. \nThis is not a good man.", "Yikes. Have some more respect for yourself\u2026 his \u201cmy way, or the Highway\u201d attitude sounds like my mom, and she\u2019s been single my entire life and made it hell all at the same time. At least you have an option to dump him now, versus waiting til 18 to move out\u2026", "Dump the BF, and invite your sis to stay in his place. Problem solved.", "What are the chances that he will rekindle something with bis friend under your roof? How are you so laidback with their history? I wouldn\u2019t trust this man at all. He\u2019s telling you who he is and you\u2019re taking it in the chin. Dump him now before he cheats on you.", "How can you trust your boyfriend with a person whom he was sleeping around with while she was dating someone else? How do you trust your boyfriend or her?", "Why do you trust someone who doesn\u2019t trust or respect you?\n\nEDIT\n\nFULL STOP. WILL THIS WOMAN ALSO BE AROUND *YOUR* DAUGHTER WHEN YOU ARE NOT AROUND?", "OP you have serious issues here and is not only your jealousy.\n1) Your sister and her child are facing eviction and uncertain future due your sister getting out of a bad relationship.\n2) Please read this loud *\"But it boiled down to him not being able to tell her what to do when they had first met\"* this is NOT normal, is NOT okay and it IS a red flag as bid as his ego.\n3) He wants to bring a side chick to fuck in your apartment, disrespecting you and ignoring you saying no.\n4) You're more pissed at that woman than your stupid horny partner who wants to bring someone else to fuck. You have to understand something, is not your sister neither that woman fault, IT'S YOUR PARTNER CHOICE.\n\n5) WAKE UP BEFORE YOU END LIKE YOUR SISTER OP. Get out of there and RUN as far and fast as you can.\n\nY-T-A to yourself for staying with that AH.", "Not \u201callowing\u201d my family to over in my house would be a deal breaker for me.  This your house also and you should be able to have anyone you want stay over.", "Does she have a car? Can she afford the insurance required for drivers?\n\nWhat was something he suggested the she rejected?", "She may not have asked. \n\nHe may have offered.", "Oh yes definitely gonna cheat on you with her, he\u2019s literally done it before and it\u2019s sad that you think you\u2019re the exception", "OP love the trust. But you're being FAR too trusting here. It is way to suspicious that his old Ex is coming around the same time your sister needed a place to stay and he denied it.\n\nAlso a non-verbal agreement isn't going to stop her from pouncing on your boyfriend. It won't stop HIM either. You're lying to yourself and need to look at these red flags and facts.\n\nWhy is it he said yes all this time but then so much closer to the move he says no and then not long after he mentions his old flame staying? Even more so he feels the need to say \"this is just retaliation for me saying no to your sister.\"\n\nIf that's the first thing that comes to his mind instead of \"don't worry we're ancient history.\" Already sounds as though he knew he said no FOR this reason, and is projecting that outwardly.", "this the same sister thats had her other kids removed from her custody due to her drug use?", "Everything you can do is great, but if I came home today and saw my sister on my porch without a place to crash for the night there isn\u2019t a person in my life that would stop me from giving her a place to crash. The fact you planned it out with time before and things still fell through is wild to me.\n\nSo basically your bfs ego is more important, since that\u2019s what was the deciding factor? Providing help can come in many forms, not just controlling how a person goes ahead. I understand that there can be a lot of complicated components to a situation like this, but the person I\u2019m with has to value my family like I do (or allow me to do so).", "That's exactly what I was thinking.", "Who he slept with while she was in a relationship!\n\nCheaters gonna cheat", "She wasn't ALLOWED to work for 4 years, most likely due to an abusive partner", "If I read it correctly, it sounds like the sister might not have been allowed to work while she was in the bad relationship. There weren't any indicators that she would become a lifer in OP's home since OP mentions that she's been looking a job but just hasn't been successful yet.\n\nThey could all have had an adult conversation about boundaries and expectations regarding her length of stay and childcare, but the SO made and broke a promise either without communicating his concerns beforehand or he has prioritized his friend over the sister.", "Not to mention getting evicted so it\u2019s unrealistic to expect her to find housing easily even if she did somehow luck into a job paying a livable wage.", "I agree that I would not let them stay, but I do not have a problem with housing my family for free. However, dealing with a toddler, and the fact the sister has not worked in years could not be helped.", "I don\u2019t think the takeaway of those stats is women exit, rather that women know when to do the right thing and end it proactively. Hard decisions.\n\nSadly something 30%+ men leave the woman during terminal illnesses\u2026that one breaks my heart.", ">That's why I hate that statistic of X% of divorces are initiated by the woman (always above 50%). Or X% of relationships are ended by the woman.\n\n6 of 7 victims of DV are women and men are almost twice as likely to cheat as women (20% of men vs 13% of women), so it's not surprising that women are more likely to end a relationship.", "How did this comment get an award???", "Top suggestion right here!", "This guy unlocked level 2 toxicity: not only controlling your SO, but also controlling the people your SO cares about. \n\nBut I\u2019m actually in the \u201che just needed space in the apartment for his hot friend to stay\u201d camp. \n\nEither way it\u2019s NFG and she needs to ditch his sorry ass.", "Omg this rings true.", "Some people lack self awareness when their partner is treating them like shit/belittling them. She likely just is blinded by rose colored glasses", "The thing is though the boyfriend knew all about those costs. None of that was his issue. OP checked multiple times. \n\nHis issue was that he didn't think sister didn't agree with everything he said and wouldn't do everything she told him...and he didn't like her reasons for leaving, which is gross.\n\nI've left an abusive partner and it is *hard*. Your whole mindset has to be on, I'm leaving, I'm doing it, I am not changing my mind. You cannot have someone in there telling you they think you're overreacting or you might not leave. It's really not a good time to meet someone and make a snap judgement on them like the boyfriend did.\n\nAnd as you've already said, he shouldn't have promised anything if he wasn't going to stick to it. Big no-no in general, but especially to someone fleeing abuse.", "He accepted it. It's already been decided she is not staying here because I was uncomfortable. We make decisions together and if im not comfortable with something we don't do it. This is the first time we have ever disagreed to the point where there was clearly no compromise for him.", "Yes. I am all for helping, friends and/or relatives. I had a friend of mine that had a very bad moment and she stayed with me for free. My BIL, that I'm not a huge fan of, had a fire in his appartement and he stayed with my husband and I for months, rent free. But in both cases, it was emergencies, they were working and I knew that it will end. I will not do the same for everyone, family or not. I heard too many stories about helping people for a few weeks and 5 months later, the person you're helping thinks they have a say in decoration and rooms and hollidays or guests.", "I am curious if some of that number is just on paper so that they can access services. \n\nStill heartbreaking.
