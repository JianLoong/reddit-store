I'm a doctor myself. I totally understand how frustrating it is when any group of people are all in the same field, won't stop talking about work, and you are the odd one out. It doesn't sound like any of them, including your wife, has made an effort to make you feel included in the conversations. People who are in medicine can, and should, talk about other things.", "INFO: Did you ever talk to her how you're feeling left out during this gathering?", "NTA - my fianc\u00e9 is a doctor and when I go with him to his friends they talk\u2026 doctor stuff. \n\nI ask questions or ask to explain some things a few times (because Im genuinely interested or just being cheeky just to annoy them having to explain things) \n\nTurns out, most people don\u2019t like to have to constantly explain themselves nor the back end of a story so they end up talking about something else to include me. \u2014- and it also gave me an opportunity to bow out and not attend anymore and he didn\u2019t mind because he realised I wouldn\u2019t stop asking questions. It was a win win. Is it an AH thing to do? Absolutely, but sometimes people need to realise that it\u2019s in their best interest to be more\u2026 inclusive.\n\nTruth be told I didn\u2019t really care cos I would just order a lot of food and nice vino to drink - \n\nIm sure your wife and her friends/colleagues don\u2019t realise that what they\u2019re doing is excluding you and being socially rude \u2026 sometimes they need to be reminded about social etiquette. \n\nMy advice is to go every now and then, however do your own things with your friends more. If your wife doesn\u2019t want to go without you then that\u2019s on her. I get it, but she also should understand that alienating and making her partner feel unwelcome and uncomfortable - even if it\u2019s inadvertently, isn\u2019t right either.", "NTA  it's not like you haven't gone before  you have gone plenty of times and its not fair that you should have to sit there left out over and over.  your wife is an adult  if she cant handle going alone then thats her issue not yours", "NTA. You are being asked to spend several hours being left out of the conversation. You\u2019ve tried to turn the conversation several times and been rebuffed (and, honestly, they are probably utterly clueless). You\u2019ve been a good husband and gone along so far, but I think at this point you\u2019ve paid your dues. The fact that your wife doesn\u2019t want to attend without you attached to her is her problem, not yours. \n\nYou\u2019ve paid your dues for this gathering and sat around bored long enough. You are allowed to bow out.", "NTA. Couples are allowed to spend time apart. \n\nNo reason you need to go to everyone one of these events. Sure - go sometimes.  \n\nI guarantee the other partners will also decline when they find out it\u2019s an option.", "NTA. I don't quite understand why she can't attend on her own. Maybe other spouses for various reasons might also like not to always attend, and you can start a fashion! :) \n\nIn any case, just because some couples behave one way, doesn't mean you two need to. (in general, it seems to me not very sustainable for couples always to insist on doing everything together - but maybe that's just me).", "NAH your wife can go by herself. It\u2019s not that big of a deal to do so. If all they do is talk about their jobs, then why waste your precious time going? It\u2019s just going to be boring and insufferable for you.", "NAH. It's uncomfortable feeling left out of the conversation, but your wife probably doesn't want to feel like the only person without their spouse present. These dinners only happen every couple of weeks, you don't have to go every time, but maybe once in a while to compromise?", "I understand this completely.  I\u2019m an attorney and my husband never liked going to the \u201cattorney\u201d parties at my old Firm.  From my perspective the conversation didn\u2019t focus just on lawyer things, but from his perspective it did.  He was a heavy construction manager (think yellow equipment) and there just wasn\u2019t much overlap between that and the law.\n\nI limited my participation in those parties to the bare minimum so he would not experience being the outsider.  Parties with your wife\u2019s crowd \u201cevery few weeks\u201d sounds very frequent. Perhaps less frequent gatherings are the answer.", "NTA. I'm in the same boat as you, my partner's friends can't be bothered to get to know me so I just stopped going to these parties or social gatherings. I explained it to my partner and he understood. \n\nI'm pretty sure tho that he hasn't fully explained to them *why* I am not coming, so you're wife might just have the same problem but kinda makes it your problem in return. Stand your ground tho. If it is not worth your energy, it is simply not worth your energy. And that is ok. You're allowed to feel that way and she should be able to enjoy her friends meeting without you as well.", "NTA. I work in a semi niche field and the same thing happens when we go out \u2014 we always end up talking about work. My wife comes with me (she\u2019s always invited, even on business trips) when she wants, and stays home when she wants. I leave it up to her, even if I know my coworkers will be bringing their spouses. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to you to have to sit at a table and either try and follow a conversation you don\u2019t understand/aren\u2019t interested in OR sit there on your phone or whatever and be perceived as rude/disengaged. \n\nThe first time I went without my wife I didn\u2019t want to go because I enjoy her presence, but she encouraged me to go and I realized it was no different than when she was there except I didn\u2019t have a hand to hold. Hopefully she comes around and realizes she can enjoy some time out on her own.", "NAH.\n\nYou need to find your own relationship dynamic, in terms of things you are prepared to tolerate but don't enjoy for your partner.  It sounds like she loves these conversations 'talking shop'.  I also firmly subscribe to the view that partners do not need to be joined at the hip / do everything together.  YMMV.", "Nah, you both have different ideas on fun conversations and that is fine. Keep encouraging her to go have fun without you, once the initial where's your partner conversation is exhausted she'll have a blast and you won't have to have an evening of general hospital you can't walk away from.", "NAH  I don't think there are any villains in this story.  Who wants to be at a function and listening to everyone else's stories?  That's very boring.  The doctor wife can a) go alone (which a grownup should be able to do), b) stay home, or c) make a concerted effort to include her wife more (which would actually be respectful).", "NAH\n\nTotally understand that this dining with co-workers arrangement has gone stale for you. Have you mentioned anything to your wife prior to saying you\u2019re not going? If she wants to attend fine & if she doesn\u2019t go because you\u2019re not going fine.

It's probably awkward for her to show up by herself when everyone else has their spouse there. These things can be considered social work functions, bonding time for her with her colleagues that actually improve her workplace environment and hence performance.  And the effect trickles to you as you also reap the benefits of her emotional and financial well-being at work as it translates to better income and improved mood at home.  IMO, I would go to these events, if they are not super frequent and support her.   That's the other part, supporting her in these endeavors.  If she's happy and cheerful at the meeting, as much as you are bored, does it bring you some happiness to see your spouse be happy and having fun?\n\nNot every spouse likes theater, hiking, or concerts, but plenty go with their SO to be able to do something together and support the other spouse's interest.  That said, hopefully she is able and willing to attend some of your functions as well.\n\nAll this is predicated on these events not being too frequent.", "NTA.\n\nI know what it's like listening to the same topic over and over again that does not interest you at all. You can fake interest all you want, nod your head and listen attentively, but when you have nothing to contribute, it's grating and get's old really fast. And that's just from one person I know. I can't imagine meeting a whole group like that regularly. \n\nYou have zero in common with them, and they made no effort to include you in their talks or to get to know you. This is a friendly meet-up, not some big work-related event that would reflect on your wife's work life. You are not obliged to go. Your wife is free to go and meet her friends and colleagues without you. Doesn't sound like bringing a spouse should be a requirement for these meet-ups.", "NTA, couples do not have to be attached at the hip 24/7 and each can do things they enjoy by themselves.", "Nah but honestly, I'd go. Boring evenings spent mentally filing your nails while pretending to be interested in your spouses friends is kinda part of the whole marriage thing", "NTA\n\nIt's fair to pass on an evening that isn't inclusive to you and it's fair that they would like to talk about work in a relaxed manner. They could be more inclusive but it is difficult when you are with a group that is so homogenous otherwise. \n\nYour wife could suggest every so often to do something a little different that would invite more diverse conversation like a themed dinner or activity or show. Your wife is being a bit of a baby to refuse to go on her own, though. You obviously just sit there, why does she need that?", "NTA. Your wife and her friends are rude. If you are aware that someone at the table is being left out of the conversation, you make an active effort to include them. If the get together is effectively a work defrag, you shouldn\u2019t feel obliged to attend at all.", "NTA. If your presence there were actually important to her, she would have tried to include you in the conversation. She is only concerned with appearances. Screw that.", "This is the kind of stuff you should do for your spouse. But i bet she never noticed that you never enjoyed it.\n\nI would personally go but she needs to understand that you dont like it. You should have had a conversation about this instead of letting her know when she made plans. If she knows how you fell, she might help you in changing the conversation to make it more inclusive for you", "YTA even though I get where you're coming from. When people from one industry come together and talk show it can be both infuriating and dull. You just sit there and it's impossible to steer them away from anything.\n\nHowever, based on your wife's reaction, this is really important to her and she really wants you to be there. Once you saw her reaction, you should have changed your mind. Is it going to kill you to be a little bored once every few weeks for a few hours? Hell, by now you should have learned enough about these subjects to contribute to the conversation.\n\nHonestly, sometimes I feel like on this subreddit people think they should never have to do anything that's even the tiniest bit inconvenient. Go support your wife.", ">She said that it was a couples' thing and as her wife, I should be there.\n\nWhat are you, an accessory???", "YTA if you still decide not to go after she shares she will only go with you. It\u2019s not too hard for you to support her and sit through a gathering once every few weeks for her.

I can appreciate why you don\u2019t want to.\n\nIs there a compromise? Can you go every other time?\n\nIn general, I don\u2019t think we should be expected to do things in our limited free time that we don\u2019t want to do. But when you\u2019re partnered, whether it\u2019s some challenging family member or friends who talk about a topic you\u2019ve no real interest in, sometimes we have to suck it up for our partner. \n\nLike\u2026I don\u2019t particularly love that every Sunday smack in the middle of the day, we visit my partner\u2019s Gma in memory care. But it\u2019s important to him so I go. \n\nIt\u2019s rude of this friend group to not try to steer the conversation towards things everyone can participate in. But to be honest, I\u2019m not super surprised as in my experience, a lot of people in medicine don\u2019t have the best social situational awareness because they\u2019re used to be the \u201cstar\u201d and being listened to not the other way around.\n\nLastly, I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s so adamant about not going alone.", "NTA.

It gets old.", "NTA\n\nIf you do not feel comfortable spending time with a group of friends then you are right to say you do not want to go. I think your wife should self reflect and should talk to her friends about making you feel more included.", "I have a family full of doctors, to a point that we have more than 2 specialists in one VERY niche field.

Unfortunately this happens with me and my partner when we go out with my friends from vet school.

I work in veterinary medicine and we\u2019re just as bad for the work related talk. I can understand why someone would want to bail on it!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHEr not going without you is HER coice, and not your fault. YOU are fine not to go.", "NTA", "NAH. My partner is in academia and it's a very similar situation. She understands how it isn't always easy for me to attend events where everyone going is from the university, and when I go our mutual friends make an effort to chat with me about other things. They'll ask me about my job, or we'll talk about other hobbies we have in common, things like that. \n\nSounds like no one is making that effort for you here. It's not fun to feel like you are attending as just an accessory. Sometimes it's okay for a one time holiday party or something, but when you are consistently attending these functions it would be nice for people to make an effort to include you.\n\nEdit: Changed vote to NAH. I do feel like your wife could be a little more understanding of your situation, but she hasn't done anything I feel would tip her into Asshole territory", "YTA: You say this only happens once every few weeks, it's not like it's a gathering that happens every week.

But I try to monitor it and keep it from getting out of hand, because it is rude to never talk about other things. And if my spouse told me that they didn\u2019t want to come because of it, my response would be to apologize, offer to try to improve the situation, and accept that they wanted to stay home if they ended up deciding on that.", "I did.

Then the wife can go by herself even though it is a little inconvenient. Grown-up relationships are not founded on doing everything together but supporting each other. OP supports her wife to go spend time with her friends, but doesn't need to go herself. It's not as she would be alone among strangers.", "The wife does not need her there because she is not part of the conversation, so it is a lot less inconvenient for her to go by herself than for OP to sit through this stuff again and again and again.

Why should she have to sit thru a dinner that speaks about things she doesnt understand or have any interest in. The wife can go alone. Pull up her big girl pants and go out for a few hours without her wife there.", "I'll admit that it can be hard not to talk about medicine since it can sometimes consume your life, and it's really nice to have friends to vent to. But it's easy to arrange separate hangouts specifically to vent about work. When there are people around who aren't in the same field, it's quite rude and inconsiderate to refuse to talk about anything other than work, and essentially muscle them out of conversation. I like your approach. A reasonable person would take that as a hint to change the topic of conversation to something less niche.", "Then, I will go with NAH, I don't think you an AH, but neither is your wife, unless she's blaming you.\n\nYou have the right to no go and a valid reason for it. Your wife choose to not attending on her own will. Personally I think she should just go, if it's to weird for her to attend alone, then she can choose to not go the next time. And I think you should at least compromise by attending a few times, not each times, just sometimes.", "[deleted]", "I mean, I kinda think the wife is an asshole here.\n\nWhat kind of person goes out with their spouse and is fine with everybody ignoring them the entire time?", "Yeah I agree. NAH should\u2019ve been my vote", "Agree. He has tried do work something that can work for him but to no avail.", "Yes you do. That's...literally what you do in interpersonal relationships. Support one another.\n\nIn fact, AA and therapy are precisely where you *don't* go with your spouse for the most part!", "Because marriage is supposed to be a partnership. If you love someone you sometimes do things for them even if you don't want to. It's no wonder the divorce rate is so high with some of the attitudes out there.", "It also helps me get out of going with him to things. \n\nHe always wanted me to catch up with them when sometimes when it was only \u201cthe boys\u201d. The guys didn\u2019t mind and always wanted me to go too but it felt like I was intruding. Like you said, sometimes you need to vent to those in the same field. \n\nI prefer to stay home when I have time or hang out with friends without him at times because I\u2019m a psychologist and lets just say\u2026 we prefer to not have our partners there when we vent. Lols - just because you\u2019re with someone doesn\u2019t mean you should be joined to the hip in some circumstances. It\u2019s healthy to be apart and have your own activities", "That's a little drastic. I get that when it isn't your own relationship, that seems like the easy answer. But I think that situations like this can definitely be resolved with time and communication between two people who want to maintain a good relationship. In fact, that is what usually happens.", "Fair point.  I suspect it's more of a lack of awareness.  I've gotten caught up in shop talk and she works in a high pressure environment, so blowing off steam with colleagues is understandable.  Someone who was more self-aware would either involve her partner or not get upset that he doesn't want to attend (perfectly valid compromise).  Not sure it tips over into being an asshole, though.", "You can edit.", "If I need support to have a meal with friends I feel like something is going really wrong in my life.", "My husband & I have been married for almost 31 years. Our relationship has stood the test time because we can function without each other & we respect each other\u2019s choices as individuals. We don\u2019t have to like the same people or the same activities. A good partnership is based on compromise & doing things that are mutually agreeable. Not forcing each other to do things they don\u2019t want to do.

It gets annoying when EVERY casual conversation revolves around their professions & they can't manage to speak about anything unrelated. I usually go to his social events with the forethought of being bored & unable to understand half of what is spoken but thankfully his events aren't as frequent as yours seem to be. You & your wife should have your own friend groups that the other is not mandated/forced to socialize with (with the exception of special occasions).", "So I work in the medical field. My supervisor had everyone on my shift show up at her place for a short holiday party. Afterwards she was talking to me about her fianc\u00e9 who we met at the party. She said he wasn\u2019t initially interested in hanging out with us, because in his experience, all her previous work parties were just people talking about work and he always felt left out, even though he\u2019s a nurse. He was pleasantly surprised when we was talking to us and work almost ever came up. I did notice at the party he kept showing back up to talk to us for a bit longer. I don\u2019t even remember us making a conscious effort on our part to ignore work talk, it just happened that way. \n\nHonestly I love my job. I think what I do it cool. That said, it\u2019s not hard to have conversations that include everyone, and this is coming from someone who has a lot of trouble with social cues.

Start a new trend, talk to the other spouses and see what they are interested in. Too bad you can\u2019t go somewhere else after dinner where the medical types can regale each other with their cases. Spouses can hang out too. \n\nI\u2019ll bet other couples in the group are dealing with this too. Heck, my partner is a marathon runner for fun, and they love to talk about how they put one foot in front of the other. I bow out often.", "NAH What do the other spouses think about this situation? Perhaps you can join with them to raise this issue.", "NTA, I would suggest telling her that the only way you\u2019ll go is if she helps you in changing the subject off of medical things.

Here's my suggestion - go and bring up subjects not related to their field.  Keep pushing the narrative in different directions.  For example, ask people if they have ever been to the Caribbean.  Talk about your interest in sunny beaches, swimming with dolphins, etc.  Ask them if they have ever done anything like that.", "NTA your wife needs to do a better job of including you or telling her friends to try to keep the conversation unrelated to work.

Have you ever thought about suggesting an alternate activity the couples can do together instead of dinner/drinks in a restaurant? Before I started working in the same industry as my husband, I hated going out for drinks with his friends because it was impossible for them to avoid shop talk. However, I suggested starting a game night instead of always going for drinks and suddenly everyone was more focused on the activity and joking than talking about work. It was also a good way to learn more about hobbies/interests (trivia helped me weed out who liked which sports, music preferences, etc.). After a few game nights I was more comfortable going for drinks with the group because I could help change the conversation in a small group or one on one. You may never feel fully comfortable or be able to stop the shop talk, but if you can find a way to engage some of the people in the group you may feel more comfortable attending some of the dinners. \n\nAt the end of the day if you don't enjoy your time with the group, it's not always necessary to attend. On the same side, your wife can choose to go without you, or stay behind because it is fair for her to feel left out if she's the only single person in attendance.

If your wife wants you to be there, why isn\u2019t your wife offering to discuss new topics and involve you in the conversation? Why is this all about her and her needs?", "I don't think you're an asshole but I do think changing the experience is important. When we choose to be a part of someone's life we also choose to engage with what's important to them. How would you feel if your wife didn't invite you, sometimes showing up is the most important thing we can do for our partner because we'd want them to show up for us. Some couples are great at Living different lives and having their own space but I think this might be a situation where your wife and her associate are trying to ensure that their spouses at least have a face to a name and  include their spouse. They're most likely people that will be there for your wife should something happen. Maybe read up on the most recent health articles so you have something to contribute and at least be able to engage in a discussion. Just a suggestion when she stops inviting you and I'm sure you'll have a reason to wish you were so going. It's just a few hours she can only say you're sick so many times", "My BIL is a doctor, and I\u2019m interested in his speciality, but he hates talking shop when he\u2019s not at work.", "You're basically at a coworker's dinner.

A tablet has more computing power - lol ;)", "But the mathematics based on 6s is fascinating! I think it was the U of Edinburgh that had a website dedicated to the history of mathematics & a whole page on Assyrian mathematics (but it was a while ago, so I might be off on the .edu site) :)", "You're probably right but there's no reason why OP should have to sit through hours of that when the subject never changes to books, movies, hobbies etc to the point where OP feels left out.", "Oh I'm not justifying anything, just commenting on why that seems to be a trend amongst doctors", "I have this book and agree. \n\nI read on a kindle e reader a lot now and people get real annoyed when they can\u2019t tell what you\u2019re reading. Very entertaining\u2026for me anyway!", "You have a real problem with a mixed group of doctors meeting while some have brought their partners and some haven\u2019t. I assure you on the strongest terms that it would be fine.\n\nSource: I have been to parties with bunches of doctors where some have brought spouses and some have not.", "NTA \n\nshes uptight", "I feel torn on this one, unless you\u2019re completely uninterested in the medical field as a whole, couldn\u2019t there be some type of interesting stories to hear, now if they\u2019re just talking medical jargon then that\u2019s a no for me so I need more info to make a proper judgment.", "Have you considered including at least one couple composed from your work?\n\nNTA", "Eurgh hanging out with doctors when you\u2019re not a medic is BORING. Heck, it\u2019s boring when you are a doctor. \n\n I have a fairly strict no work chat/time limited chat for work policy when going out with friends. But a lot of my colleagues have two issues: 1) work is their life, they don\u2019t DO anything else, no hobbies, don\u2019t read the news or watch tv, they have nothing else to talk about. 2) their partner is not medical so the only outlet they have is when they\u2019re with other medics.\n\nDon\u2019t hang with them, they\u2019re boring and won\u2019t change. Also tell your wife she needs a hobby, work chat is fine at home to a point, but work won\u2019t love you back when you retire and should never be your whole identity. Medics have a hard time with this concept but it\u2019ll fuck your kids up thinking it\u2019s healthy to make your whole life medicine.

I love him to enjoy some friendships without me. \nYour wife may learn to cope.", "Ug. I\u2019m sorry. NTA \n\nI personally don\u2019t understand the concept of a regular gathering like this being a \u201ccouples\u201d event. It\u2019s not Valentine\u2019s Day or prom. You\u2019re adults and sometimes adults have different interests.\n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026 maybe I was raised weird. Maybe my wife and I are weird, and our friends are all weird. But if a spouse doesn\u2019t go to gatherings it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s important to make an appearance once in a while, sure. \n\nBut damn\u2026 if you\u2019re just sitting there in a corner while everyone talks shop, I don\u2019t understand why your wife feels it\u2019s necessary to force you to sit there like non-sentient security blanket.", "NTA your wife should be more accommodating and try to understand where you\u2019re coming from since you did explain why you didn\u2019t want to go."]}
