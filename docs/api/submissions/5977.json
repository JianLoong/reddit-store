About a week ago as i was leaving our condo to pick up my wife there was a man shooting a compound bow, across the parking lot through an empty stall (with cars on either side) across a side walk at a target sitting next to the building next to ours. My car was parked next to one of the cars next to the open stall. The Bow wasn\u2019t the most powerful, I\u2019m guessing a 50 pound draw. I walk out and ask if he\u2019s shooting it. He said yes. I told him he can\u2019t be shooting a bow in the parking lot. He said \u201cwhat do you care? You don\u2019t even live here\u201d. I told him I did, and pointed to my house, the one I just walked out of. (Hind sight probably shouldn\u2019t have told him what one was mine). He said he was told he he could do this. I told him it was dangerous to be shooting in between the cars. He angrily gathered his stuff and said \u201care you kidding me!\u201d. I told him no and if I saw him doing it again I would call the HOA (wish I had said I would call the police). I get in my car and leave for 20 minutes. I came back and he was gone so I thought it was over.   This morning I look out the window and see 2 adults and 3 kids ranging from about 3 to 11 ish. The 2 adults and 2 older kids had a bow. They were standing in the same spot shooting across the parking lot through cars at a target this time sitting on the side walk next to the communal mail box. So I called 911. A few minutes later the cops showed up they gathered there bows and target and went in side. I did notice the adults pointing at our door obviously angry.   We looked up the local law and shooting a bow within city limits counts as discharge of a deadly weapon. They were shooting where kids play and even if they were carful things happen.

Just call 911.", "NTA\n\nGrew up with bow hunters and you were right to call on them, as what they were doing is extremely reckless and dangerous. \n\nYou made a mistake of telling him you would call and pointing out where you live. If you can, set up cameras asap as they may retaliate against your house and/or vehicle.", "NTA. You did exactly what you were supposed to. As you said, bows are considered as a weapon where you live, so you're perfectly in your right to call 911 for that.\n\nBeing an archer, I can guarantee you that if I were to shoot my bow outside (it's legal to do so where I live), I would do it somewhere where I have zero chance of accidentally hitting people or objects (in the forest for example, with a hill as backdrop to catch stray arrows) and I would mark my shooting area in case someone would come nearby. It's common sense.", "NTA wtf? That could easily kill Somone. I doubt he was allowed like he says he was", "NTA.\n\nIn our city I can\u2019t even shoot a bow in my yard.

That's common sense you shouldn't need to look up the law to know you can't shoot a deadly weapon in a parking lot. What's wrong with them? It's a good thing you called 911 when you did because it was only a matter of time until someone got hurt. You can't even see who is nearby in a parking lot especially children. My dad wouldn't even let me be in the front yard (I live in the country so that's no road nearby) when he was shooting a bow because kids dart. You can tell them a million times \"you have to stay behind me. This can hurt you\" and they can still dart out of nowhere. Why take the risk?", "NTA at all. Next time, though, I'd say just call 911 without confronting them, for your own safety.", "NTA. 50 lb bow will take down a buffalo. A missed shot will go through fence, windows, drywall, and easily kill someone. You\u2019d call the cops if someone was shooting a .22 rifle. A lot can go wrong with any projectile.

Maybe they are proficient, doesn't matter, bad things can happen in an instant, let fly and a kid/adult walks in the line of fire. It's too easy to load up and get out in the country and play with your new toy. No safety practiced here at all.", "NTA. That guy is horribly negligent. Have you contacted the HOA too?

Oh HELL no, NTA. That could kill somebody!", "NTA! Thanks for reporting those idiots!!! I'm a vet tech in an animal shelter - I've seen an arrow injury on a fucking house cat.

You never know when an arrow is going to go haywire, or if a kid in a moment of insufficient brain development is going to shoot an arrow straight up. They are weapons, they shouldn't be shot anywhere near people unless those people knowingly accept the risk.", "i'm sorry this has landed on your doorstep.  this is not going to be the last you hear of these neighbors.  expect them to come after you.  go on the offense, protect yourself.  do know, they will retaliate.

That was stupid on display", "I grew up shooting a bow and guns in my backyard in the country. I now live in a suburb of a major city and have no place to shoot. I drive 2 hours to go to a good range. There is no excuse for this guy shooting a bow in a parking lot. Even a 35 lb pull (which is the lowest I've seen on adult size bows) will easily kill someone.

A 50lb bow is very powerful, and has the ability to end the life of a 200lb mammal in minutes. I love archery, and one of the biggest factors in our sport is safety.\n\nWhat these people are doing is extremely dangerous and unsafe. It only takes one small accident to end a life. Doesn\u2019t matter if its a 25lb bow or a 50lb bow, they need to find a place to shoot safely, or find a new hobby.", "YTA, of course. Why didn't you speak with him again, or involve other community members? Not sure why you thought escalating things by calling cops would help anything. They could have killed him! Would he have deserved death for his offense?? How would you feel if cops had rolled up and blasted his ass the instant they saw him with a bow? Hopefully like dogshit. Lucky you it didn't happen - this time.  \n\n\nNext time show some thoughtfulness and restraint.", "My only issue is you didn\u2019t speak to parents first. A normal parent would not give their kid permission to shoot anywhere near where people walk like a parking lot. I only would ask before calling police bc it is a weapon and if the kids are stupid enough to aim it an officer even innocently they could be shot. I do see in the post though that adults presumably parents were there on the second day so they knew what was going on and condoning the dangers activity so cops is the only thing left. But normally would say try to speak to parents first. Alert the HoA to the issue.", "Exactly. Bows are weapons, and need to be treated as such.", "My first thoughts also. A 50lb bow is enough to have a 200lb deer bleed to death. It has no business being used in a shared parking lot.", ". ..Are you high?", "I am and I want what this person is smoking to think that was reasonable."]}
