I was just suggesting that you save the emergency number for when someone is hurt or in the act of being hurt. But you are more important than anyone else so use it however you like. Just don\u2019t bitch when you\u2019re having a heart attack and you get put on hold for 3-5 min.", "Well if you\u2019ve shot both and you still think the hazards of shooting a gun in a parking lot are comparable to a bow, and therefore equally as dangerous. It is an emergency. It might as well be a alien attack, cause you don\u2019t know the difference.", "NTA and I'm glad you tried telling them first, although pointing out your house may have been a mistake. Maybe they didn't know, maybe they didn't realize the ridiculousness of it, maybe we need more humanity and conversation in our world. That's why I'm glad you tried to talk to them first. And then you followed up. You did a great job. You had a conversation, you protected your community,  you followed up with appropriate action.", "Screw him. Absolutely NTA.

Something could've gone seriously wrong if you hadn\u2019t stepped in.\n\nAlso, a full parking lot is the worst place to fire any type of weapon, even without any bad intentions, it would probably work out to be cheaper to get a membership to a range rather then pay out insurance if an arrow went through a car window or injured someone, so imo you did them a favor.", "NTA.

At least 4 people (including OP's father - a retired police officer) give reasons why it's urgent. But you stay strong.

But I don\u2019t solve problems from my window either. If I thought it was an actual emergency, I\u2019d go out there and warn people or ask them to find a safer place to shoot. \n\n\u201cHigh chance of occurring\u201d welcome to drama queens of Reddit. If you\u2019re shooting a target 20-40 yards away it\u2019s pretty hard to not see someone coming and them not see you. It\u2019s not like a gun. You don\u2019t have a high chance, you have a very very low chance. So few people die from bow and arrow each year it\u2019s not even a recorded statistic. So the chance is actually very low. \n\nThis is why I thought it wouldn\u2019t be an emergency, but clearly I was wrong and you guys think everything is an emergency. But you\u2019ve probably never shot a bow either.", "Same, I killed a mole on accident with a training bow. Arrows be dangerous", ">So few people die from bow and arrow each year it\u2019s not even a recorded statistic. So the chance is actually very low.\n\nHave you compared that statistics to the actual number of people who own a bow and arrow? Or that given the choice, would prefer to be armed with it as opposed to a handgun?\n\nOr maybe the chances of getting hurt by a bow are low because people who own one don't do stupid shit like, I don't know, shoot one in a parking lot towards a sidewalk.\n\nOP already asked him to find a safer place to shoot. This caused the number of people shooting weapons to increase fivefold.\n\nOP's response was appropriate to the danger these people were posing, and to the fact their warnings were already ignored once.", "Hell I punched a hole through thick cardboard with a homemade cosplay bow *that I didn't think wolrd even work*", "It not as dangerous as you have made it out to be. But it\u2019s not a surprise because everyone on here is so dramatic. You just used the term increased 5 fold to add 1 adult and 3 children (3-11) to a group as if they were a feared army that went from 10,000 to 50,000. So clearly whatever you deem dangerous is at bare minimum an extreme exaggeration. \n\nI\u2019d have gone and talked to him again and asked him to stop rather than demand. I damn sure wouldn\u2019t hid in my house like a coward and call the police. He left the first time without a fight, just grumbled. I don\u2019t know what about that response would make you think he poses a threat. \n\nI don\u2019t know the rules of your city or HOA (I\u2019d guess HOA would cover it) but just because a cop confiscated something doesn\u2019t make it right. I\u2019ve had sheriffs try to kick me off cow ponds bird hunting only to have game and fish come tell them they\u2019re incorrect. I\u2019m my city, shooting a bow on private property is perfectly legal."]}
