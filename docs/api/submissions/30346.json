While I was searching I found a file named \"Security\" which I thought was weird so I clicked on it and it was filled with voice recordings labeled with my name (as well as other people's names), dates, and times. I listened to one of them and it was a recording of a conversation we had a few days ago about an anime we both watch. The recording was very long, and he didnt stop recording until we said our goodbyes and you could hear the door shut behind me after I left. I didn't know he was recording the conversation and I was confused, so I listened to another one and it was also the same thing, a recording of a date we had recently and he recorded the whole date. I started to get nervous so I took my work flashdrive from my purse and copied many of the recordings with my name on them. I told him I wasn't feeling well and I needed to go home so I left, but I noticed his phone face down nearby.   \nI called my friend when I got home and told him what I found and he said it's definitely weird and creepy but it's really toxic and messed up for me to have listened to them in the first place and then stole them off his PC without discussing anything with him, and that I acted like a crazy gf. Honestly I just got scared and super paranoid which is why I didn't want to confront him. I felt as though I was in the presence of a stalker or something, but my friend said I'm being overdramatic and jumping to conclusions based on zero information since I never confronted him and this wouldn't have happened if I wasn't snooping in the first place.   \nI'm so conflicted now but AITA for taking the recordings instead of directly talking to him?", "created_utc": 1699154837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17o3b2l/aita_for_stealing_my_boyfriends_secret_recordings/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

RUN. That is some scary shit right there.\n\nDude is obviously paranoid and from the fact he named the file 'Security', he probably intends to use them as blackmail/reciepts/etc. for anything he finds incriminating. That is not a safe person imo.\n\nDo not let anyone talk you down into thinking that you are wrong for 'invasion of privacy' when the very thing you found was an invasion of privacy??!!!! This is some horror film shit. RUN, DO NOT WALK.\n\n(obviously NTA)", "Nope. Nobody does that. NTA. Yes, you went snooping which isn't cool, but wow, it's a good thing you did because now you know your bf records people without their knowledge.To what end? Does it really matter? No, it does not. Super creepy.", "NTA, it's very strange to record conversations without consent (in some countries, it's illegal).", "Are you in the U.S.?  If so, in some states it is illegal to record some one with out their consent and/or knowledge.  Check the law.\n\nAs to the recordings, what he did was creepy.  As to what you did, I do not think it is creepy as you want to know what he has on you.  \n\nBottom line?  He can not be trusted.  You can either confront him about it or dump him.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - That is super creepy. Makes you wonder who he shares stuff with and what else he's recording....", "NTA Who know what else he has recorded. I've always believed it to be wrong to end a relationship by text.  Until now.  Do not go back to his place.  Do not arrange to see him.  Just RUN.", "NTA - the problem isn\u2019t you seeing or taking the recordings - it\u2019s that your bf is secretly recording you. That\u2019s a red banner waving - run!", "NTA. That\u2019s not normal. Trust your gut. Don\u2019t go back to his place. Make sure more of your friends and family is aware of this situation. Keep yourself safe. Even his response to you finding out is a red flag.", "NTA, and consider yourself lucky that you found this out before things got more serious. That is very creepy and seriously messed up (not illegal in the majority of states in the US, but still creepy and messed up, and is illegal in large-population states like California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, and Massachusetts - that's about 100 million people right there).", "NTA for taking them\n\nDepending on where you live, he was committing a felony. And even if it wasn't, it was creepy and proved something is very wrong with him. There is NO reason he can give that would justify sneakily recording you. (A surprise for your birthday, the excuse you used to snoop? Still a huge NO.)\n\n And there is nothing wrong with taking your own conversation back  (and deleting it off his PC.). \n\nGet as far from him as possible. He has serious issues. You don't need to tell him the reason if you're scared of him. Give whatever reason you like. \n\nNow, YTA also = you snooped through his computer. Don't go through another person's computer files. Also grounds for dropping a relationship like a hot potato.", "NTA and get better friends!", "*MOLLY, YOU IN DANGER, GIRL.*\n\nNTA. Your friend is being dense. You werent spying, you were looking for footage to use as a gift. When you see your own name, of course you're going to look. Proof that you weren't being weird or toxic is that you didn't listen to the OTHER people's recordings which took a great deal of restraint. I would assume you've had sex with him, right? So have you found a recording if that yet? \n\nI can't think of any reasonable excuse for *recording whole dates without someone's knowledge.* Can you? And that guy you called is NOT your friend. A friend would be concerned for you, not defending the privacy rights of the guy recording you.\n\nDon't say anything about it until after you have picked up all of your things from his house and changed your passwords on absolutely every single account you have, including all banking information. Call the big three and lock your credit so no one can apply for a loan or a credit line without knowing it, and make sure it is completely random. Over the times you've talked, you've probably given him tons of private information without even thinking of it. All someone needs is a birthday and a full name to get started on identify theft. Throw in personal details and you're screwed. Collect your things, secure your assets and information and GTFO. If the curiosity is too much, ask when you're safely gone.", "This is so f'ed up. Confront your boyfriend immediately, but with a friend present that will have your back. Finding out your significant other has been secretly recording you without permission is extremely distressing. It does not matter how you came about the recordings. Your invasion of his privacy fails massively in comparison to what he has been doing to you. All you have to do is admit to him what you did was wrong, and tell him why you did what you did. Then you should expect him to do the same. If he can't even do that then get away from that situation. But tbh this has probably run its course after this massive breach of trust. You're not overreacting. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Change every password and make sure you have all updates installed on all your devices, then do a full security scan on them. If you don't know much about this stuff, get help from a friend or professional who does. Do the searches on your credit mentioned (I am not from the US so am not across how it works over there). Be careful. He is definitely creepy, who records entire dates? Not someone with no ulterior motives! \n\nIf there are still copies on his computer, I would suggest you try to erase them before you cut him off. Can you gain access to his computer again, using any pretext? Delete the files, and empty the trash, and otherwise ensure there are no copies on his computer. Hopefully he has not copied anything off to an external hard drive or cloud. \n\nAlso, if you see other names in this 'Security' folder and you can do it without jeopoardising your own safety, consider giving those people a heads up that their interactions with your ex-boyfriend were being recorded and they should similarly review their personal security.", "NTA run run like your hair is on fire; RUN!  \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "My sisters boyfriend kept saying, \"should we record this interaction, just in case\".
