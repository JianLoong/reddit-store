You sound like you've been a saint so far and I could never have put up with everything you're describing. The man needs to send the pictures and ashes with his daughter and move on.", "YWBTA if you phrase it like that. But having your life dictated like this is also not okay. It seems like he feels guilty about letting go.  Also deciding whether or not to have kids because it might upset his first kid or former in laws is kind of crazy.\n\nInfo: have you guys considered therapy?", "NTA. However you're blaming the wrong person for your current predicament. Your husband is cosigning on all of this and you need to find out why. Think about it; your step daughter never comes around so why are the pictures and the ashes on display in your home? You could just take them down and put them up when your stepdaughter comes over. No one can stop you and your husband from having children. Same thing with moving. I wouldn't be surprised if he secretly wants all of these things and he's just  hiding behind his daughter and former in laws.", "NTA in the least. As another commenter said, there are 3 people in your marriage: he needs to choose who his life partner is, her or you. There is ZERO need for you \u2014 or him \u2014 to interact with his ex in laws as the child is now an adult. Their grief and denial does not need to be your problem, but you have a husband problem if he\u2019s passively allowing them to make it your problem.", "NTA but I would say don\u2019t eliminate everything. If you have a spare room where the daughter stays on occasion let there be a special picture and her ashes there, but not all over the house.", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t let the daughter grieve her mom and have photos to remember her. A compromise would be a special place just for her photos and ashes  that she can arrange in a way that protects them and maybe isn\u2019t all through your house. She also should get some counseling or therapy. You can\u2019t just not live because of loss. Especially if you were planning on having children. But she\u2019s going to need help through the grieving process.", "For the rest of your concerns, N T A. But for your actually inquiry about the pictures and the ashes? YTA.", "NTA but getting into that relationship means a lot of heavy baggage. As a friend I would have warned you to proceed with caution or run away because some baggage is hard to deal with but that is a whole cargo hold of baggage. I understand daughter is traumatized but life must go on. That family is not your problem. You and husband should sit down with step daughter and explain very nicely and with sensitivity some pics and ashes have to go. Do a gradual removal of pics. Maybe ashes can go to grand parents or daughter. \n\nDrug addicts wreak havoc on their loved ones. There is good reason why they are cut off. Yes it\u2019s not their fault, but they need to want to get sober. Even after death still leaving a mess.", "Sorry, but YWBTA getting in the middle of this. Despite his deceased wife's problems, she was rhe mother of his daughter, and they both shared a life together before you entered the picture. \n\nThe family admittedly sounds terrible, especially telling you not to have \"replacement kids\"\n\nBur you're not going to get them to get over or let go without a mountain of drama and resentment.

But only because you let this go on so long that trying to undo it is going to be difficult. You really need to sit down with your husband and talk through these things.

That just doesn't make sense. \n\nI would imagine when the daughter is settled living completely on her own some of those pictures would go to her. But I would talk about moving some around or gifting her some now so they aren't so prominent. Having some though is respectful of where the daughter came from.\n\nI'm also confused on the children thing. Was this THEIR decision or your husband's decision? How are other people making this decision for you? Or are you not able to advocate for your needs to your husband? It sounds like you guys really need to work on communication. If you married with the intent of children, and that's not happening now that's actually a huge thing and warrants a lot of discussion. Or were children only ever a maybe to begin with?

She needs to learn life is for the living, it cannot completely stop when someone passes. Doesn't matter if the person was a Saint or a sinner. Your husband could use some therapy too. Taking the photos and ashes down won't do anything to improve your issues until they get help. Until your husband learns to put his foot down to his daughter and in laws.

That wasn't my intent and I am sorry. What I mean is, her daughter, her parents, and your husband have an entire history with her, and it includes good stuff too, which is naturally what they remember now that she's gone. That's just the way memories work, we remember the good stuff more. Whereas, your memories are only bad.)\n\nIs the pressure coming from your husband, or from his family? Can you sit down with your husband and come up with a compromise? Perhaps one or two pictures of her, and her ashes somewhere in the house, but not as visible?\n\nIf you celebrate Christmas, and if you have a husband who is very bad at paying attention to detail, you can always try to be a bit sneaky.

I could see once in a while with the daughter and them, but not all the time or even yearly. \n\nBut it seems like the bigger issue is that you and your husband are not at all on the same page and he uses your daughter as the excuse.

I think there's just so much here - so much pain and heartache and horribleness. You have a right to feel comfortable in your own home. They have the right to mourn someone who was important to them. You and your husband will have to find a workable compromise, and he will have to tell his daughter, while taking responsibility for it himself - no, \"OP didn't want so many pictures around,\" because then you'll be the baddie; but rather, \"Your mother was and will always be an important part of my life, but it's time for me to move on.\" Good luck to you.", "Look it's your house too and your DIL, must understand that, ashes on her room it's okay, no in the entire house, you must put limits on her, even if at this point, and put your husband to stop pamper his daughter too, both of them must, walk from this and look for the future, stop of keep thinking about the past - NTA", "I think its past time for marriage counseling.

Why is this adult calling shots in your home and marriage??", "NTA.  She\u2019s an adult.  Her mother died.  It should not be affecting your marriage.  Like you said, you should really only need to go to her family things if it directly concerns the daughter.  Enough is enough.  If she was 10, yeah.  Also no reason to have a memorial to his ex i your house.", "NAH.\n\nYou're allowed to not want to have decorating and other personal decisions revolve around your husband's deceased ex. That's a pretty reasonable thing to want.\n\nHis daughter is allowed to want pictures of her mom, and ashes, and to have her dad (and you, I guess) participate in stuff with her mom's side of the family, although I'll admit it's a little weird that she decorated *your* house with these things if she has her own place to decorate now, or if she could have them at her maternal grandparents (etc) house. And just because she wants those things doesn't mean she's entitled to them, but we'll get to that. \n\nYour husband is allowed to want pictures and ashes of his ex around the house too, and even if he doesn't, he's allowed to take his daughter's feelings into consideration when making life decisions about where to move or whether he wants to have more kids. \n\nHere's the thing that I'm not getting from your post though: is this actually what everyone wants? Your husband let his daughter decorate your house with mementos of his ex. Why did she do that, and why did he let her? Is that really helpful for her healing process, and he's trying to be sensitive to her? Your husband let his ex's family dictate his current family planning and vacation schedule; is that because he knows his daughter would be upset, or are they all just assuming what his (adult!) daughter thinks/wants? \n\nYou clearly have hopes and dreams for your future with your husband. Does he share them? Does he share them under the condition his daughter isn't hurt by those hopes and dreams? Are there any things where he's willing to de-prioritize her comfort for the sake of making you happy? Once you two are on the same page, you need to have a frank conversation with his daughter about her boundaries and how much support she actually needs. If she's truly traumatized by the thought of her father no longer hosting his ex-wife's ashes, it might be time for therapy. \n\nUltimately, if you can't be happy with the ghost of his ex lurking over you, and his daughter can't be happy without her mom watching over a family unit that hasn't existed for a long time, it puts your husband in the exceptionally shitty place of having to choose between the two of you.", "NTA -\n\nHow old are you and your husband? For him to have a 25 year old and considering having a new baby??? Shewwww. Its not as easy as it was when he was his daughters age!! Also, just a different perspective... are you sure he wants to have a kid? Or is he just agreeing to keep you somewhat happy?  It doesn't sound like he has enough backbone to stand up to anyone, what makes you think he's standing up and being completely honest with you??", "Absolutely  100% NTA- This is YOUR home.  Not your SDs.  If the man you are married to continues to allow his daughter to dictate the life he has with YOU then he is not ready to be YOUR Spouse.  YOU call the shots in your relationship and if YOU want your own children then think long and hard about staying with this man before you waste a lot of time.  Take the pics and ashes down and offer them to his daughter.  Don't be afraid to set very clear boundaries with both of them.  Dont worry about what other family members think- its none of their buisness.", "Tell him life is for the living. At least your life anyway.", "NTA you don\u2019t have a kid with him right? Get out while you can.", "NTA, was his exwife OD related to him moving on and getting remarried?  if so he probably feels guilty, but he shouldn't be.\n\nI think you need to have the conversation about how you are unwilling to put your life on hold and pander to the memory of his ex wife.  That you are willing to spend time with his ex inlaws, but you want to share important holidays with your family and his family as well.\n\nThat because they were divorced and you were married before she passed that it was time for the photos and ashes to go into his daughter room.\n\nIts going to be a difficult conversation and I would suggest doing it away from his daughter, but you can't put your life on hold any longer.", "NTA. OP go ahead and enforce your boundaries because for one it\u2019s your marital house where you are supposed to feel safe and comfortable if that\u2019s not the case where else are you going to feel that way. Also daughter is 25 she has her own life and is doing her own things, you have done more than enough for her by putting your life on hold for 5 years. Furthermore if kids is what you really want and you and your husband have previously decided you were going to have kids then it\u2019s not a decision anyone else should be making for the both of you. Do what makes you happy in this marriage or else a lot of resentment will build up and it might just end up breaking down. Good luck!", "NTA The ashes and pics should be at the daughter's house.   \n\n\nI'd have had a fit if my late husband had allowed anything like this. (Happily, his ex is alive and kicking, so that was never an issue for us.)", "Info wait, is the daughter an adult and not living in your home?", "NTA\n\nhis daughter can have it all.\n\nthis is the part you have to ask him when will you 2 be an actual family though. it feels like you are a 3rd party", " I have to disagree. It's reasonable for the daughter to have her mother's pics and ashes in her room. It is NOT reasonable for them to be all over the rest of the house.   \n\n\nThe OP's husband divorced his first wife - she's an ex. He is not a widower. No wife should have to tolerate this.", "My thoughts too! And sadly, OP gets the \u201cshort end of the stick\u201c in all matters.", "\"they really aren't hurting you to have them there...\" This is such an AH thing to say.  Who wants to look at the person who their husband HATED all day just to keep from dealing with the immature , GROWN , daughter????", "He is 40, I am 35. Him and ex were teen parents. She admitted to intentionally sabotaging bc.", " You should not be tolerating this. I understand that you're trying not to rock the boat with the daughter. I did the same with my late husband's adult kids (though their mother is still alive and kicking).  They had flown the nest before my husband left his adulterous first wife. After we married, her affair partner died, so their mother always had to come first because she was 'on her own'. (Oh no she wasn't!)  \n\n\nI had to put my foot down in the end...and I wish I'd done it sooner. Give an inch, etc.    \n\n\nIt's easy for me to say now, but if you're too nice you'll just be walked right over.  \n\n\nTime for those pics and ashes to be moved. For goodness' sake, your husband was a divorcee, not a widower.", "How long has his wedding pic been on the wall with yours??? This- is not normal.  Feel free to get up and take it down right now.", "Honestly, I think you need to decide whether or not you can live like this. It's not honoring the ex that's the problem, it's structuring your whole life around her. It isn't fair.\n\nPersonally, I would figure out my own needs (fundamental can't live without things) and then go into ultimatum territory. Ultimatums aren't great, but sometimes you have to say, \"either we change things together so my basic needs are met or i need to change things for myself.\"", "If you guys are gonna do this you better get to it!", "EXACTLY! There has been three in this marriage - OP, her husband and his dead ex/in-laws and OP has got the \u201cshort end of the stick\u201c in all matters.  I don\u2019t know if marriage counseling would even help but OP a deserves to have a full-life and children (if she wants) before it is too late.", "Since she died, about 4 months after we got married", "This. The OP is a better woman than I am. I'd be giving the husband a choice between me and the pictures under those circumstances.   \n\n\nThis is simply not on. The OP did NOT marry a widower. His ex is a saint and must be revered because she's dead? This is infuriating.", "I don't know how you've done this for so long but I would guess that your husband may find some relief in hearing your strong support to get his ex drug addicted wife's face OUT of his home. It has to be a constant reminder of the worst time in his life.  If he knows that you support him in that it will be easier for him to stop letting his daughter run your home.", "Ya- his first response was a dick thing too- you beat me to the punch.", "Suggest making a shrine for her mother in her room. Then you're keeping things in a private area, allowing her to have these things of her mother, and it's like you're also trying to say \"yes I understand she's special, she should have her own special place.\" It's more likely to be well received as a result. You can get electric candles, ask if she has an article of her clothing or jewelry, and quotes she liked that remind her of her mother and write it in a fancy font and frame it to make it a little more personal and customized. I'd talk with hubby about making this suggestion and helping to create it as well so it stays between them and not a \"your step mother wanted this\" thing", "Yes - OP, Husband and his adult daughter - His drug addicted EX wife is NOT on his mind.", "Yes"]}
