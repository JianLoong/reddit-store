My friend is getting married and as a wedding gift my husband and I have been giving my friend and her husband to be private dance lessons for their first dance. Three times a week we meet up with them for an hour to work on their routine. They have really improved and we feel they are ready for their first dance and beyond meeting us to practice their routine and keep it locked in they don't need anything else. \n\nToday my friend admitted to me that she doesn't want me and my husband dancing at her reception as she feels it would steal the attention away from her and her husband as this is our job and we'll always be so much better than them. I was quick to assure her that we had no intention of doing anything even resembling a routine and at most we'd just be having fun or doing a slow dance but she wasn't happy with this and claimed that with how we move together even that would be too much. \n\nI'm honestly shocked by this and more than a little hurt. We can easily tone it down to a normal standard of dancing and do so all the time at things like weddings for this very reason. We love dancing and the fact she wants us to just sit there and not join in the dancing all night long makes both my husband and I a little uncomfortable. He has suggested we just wait till everyone has a few drinks in them and then join in the dancing when it wont be noticed but I worry this could make us assholes as she's asked us to not dance. That being said what else would we do after the meal? as it's going to be hours and hours of dancing. The only thing I can think of beyond that is that we simply leave after the meal but I don't want to seem like we're angry either.", "created_utc": 1693978361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bbq28/wibta_if_i_danced_at_my_friends_wedding_despite/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s really stupid and petty for her to ask for (what I\u2019m assuming were) free dance lessons and then expect you and your husband to attend her wedding and not join in on the festivities. You should speak with her again and share with her how you feel. There is traditionally a first dance for the married couple, so I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t have their big moment then and allow y\u2019all to dance while everyone else is. Y\u2019all really need to have another conversation and clarify what is expected.

It causes some psychosis, intense egotism, and random behaviour.  Somebody add this to the medical books.......LOL", "Damn. You taught them to dance and a whole routine, and they (or just she) are so sensitive about their skills that they are worried that you and your husband dancing normally would steal attention away. That hurts. And sounds boring. And also hard to do... at least as someone who danced for many, many years and is not ballroom professional, but dancing is just what I do instinctively (seriously I have not noticed myself dancing before), and to be told to not do it AT ALL would be... yikes. I really don't know what the judgement is, because I think the request is..... **a lot**, it just comes down to your friend who you know best.

When you have dancing at a wedding, then you invite your guests to dance and allowing them to \"show off\" on the dance floor.", "Info: Has this happened before where people have told you that they felt you stole the show from them?  Do you always put on a \"show\" at every event, intentional or not?  \n\nClearly you have a natural talent that draws attention, but do the people in your life feel in general that you go overboard?  This totally may not be a \"you\" thing, but it could be the perception.", "Ooh this is tough. There's two competing issues: 1) your friend's patently unreasonable request to you versus 2) what she explicitly asked for on her wedding day.

Because of that, it's the softest possible YWBTA (by a fraction of a millimeter).\n\nBut all is not lost. I would tell her right up front that you and your husband won't be staying past dinner. Why? Because you find it hurtful that she is explicitly excluding you from the party and commanding you not to enjoy yourselves by doing the very thing she asked you to teach her. That's immensely and ironically selfish. Maybe she'll see the light.", "NTA I\u2019m so confused why people think the wedding should be \ud83d\udcaf their control/dream. Let people be people.", "Well that\u2019s shitty. You spent time giving them lessons and now you can\u2019t even do normal standard dancing with everyone else?

If I were you I would sit there and look as miserable and bored as possible every time she glances over.", "So they used you for your skill and now they don\u2019t want you to dance at all at their wedding? I hope they paid you!! NTA if it was me I wouldn\u2019t turn up. Now you know how they really feel about you.", "Your friends are the assholes. To ask people who clearly love the couple enough to give free dance lessons not to dance is absurd. However, I\u2019d just decline to go altogether. I\u2019m no where near a professional dancer but dancing at a wedding reception is the best part! For them to ask you to not participate in the most celebratory part of the actual party is selfish on their part.", "NTA that\u2019s ridiculous that you\u2019re not allowed to just do the same normal dancing that everyone else will be doing.", "That\u2019s very unreasonable of her and is saddening because it seems like you guys are good enough friends that you and you husband are teaching them for their first dance. I would be so hurt and rightfully so. Maybe just do the dinner and leave if it was me I don\u2019t know if I would want to go at all. But I definitely would not dance if she specifically asked you not to. The petty me wouldn\u2019t go at all or I would go and sit there and when someone asks I would tell them the bride specifically asked us not to and if she\u2019s mad about that she knows how ridiculous it is to even ask that of you.", "This is how I'm envisioning OP and spouse...\nhttps://youtu.be/NIDabDkcS8o?si=HCRpTwbnx21nJQ74\n\nYou're only the AH if you whip out those clicky clamshell things.", "Tell friend you won't be attending the dance since you're not allowed to dance.

They are always being discussed, congratulated, etc.  If I had not witnessed this myself, I would probably say the bride is the AH.

Skip the wedding.", "So you will get a little bit of joy out of dancing at the wedding at the cost of annoying the bride a great deal. There's a reason she made the odd request even if you don't understand it. Read the room. Stay off the dance floor.\n\nAnd lots of people don't dance at weddings.\n\nYWBTA", "YTA. You can live just fine if you didn't dance one night on a special request.", "Ywbta because dancers can never not go too hard.

I'm pretty sure the bride is worried that when the other guests see you dancing way better, they will leave the dancefloor or even leave the wedding early due to lack of fun for them. \n\nIts like if you do regular pot lucks and one of the attendee is a professional cook - the others will start not bringing anything anymore or straight out not coming anymore bc they don't want to be compared to a professional. \n\nSure, ppl shouldn't be so insecure, but the sad fact is they are.", "YWBTA. I used to dance seriously - as in pay for weekly personal lessons with someone who was not just a pro but probably one of the best teachers in the country. After a couple of years of serious practice, I was probably good enough to teach. There is no way you're going to be able to hide the fact that you're competitive ballroom dancers. There's going to be a smoothness and intuitiveness to your dancing that will stand out to at least some people. But more to the point, can you not suck up your hurt feelings for just a few hours? Your friend is hopefully only going to have one wedding and whilst I agree that she's being ridiculous, it is her wedding. She's not asking you to cut a limb off or shave your heads. Just don't dance for a couple of hours. I mean, the humanity!!! Don't burn a friendship over this. If you still have itchy feet, find a club to go to after the reception or dance at home. There will be plenty of other opportunities to dance later. Take one for the team.
