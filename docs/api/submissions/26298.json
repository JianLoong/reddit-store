My friend is getting married and as a wedding gift my husband and I have been giving my friend and her husband to be private dance lessons for their first dance. Three times a week we meet up with them for an hour to work on their routine. They have really improved and we feel they are ready for their first dance and beyond meeting us to practice their routine and keep it locked in they don't need anything else. \n\nToday my friend admitted to me that she doesn't want me and my husband dancing at her reception as she feels it would steal the attention away from her and her husband as this is our job and we'll always be so much better than them. I was quick to assure her that we had no intention of doing anything even resembling a routine and at most we'd just be having fun or doing a slow dance but she wasn't happy with this and claimed that with how we move together even that would be too much. \n\nI'm honestly shocked by this and more than a little hurt. We can easily tone it down to a normal standard of dancing and do so all the time at things like weddings for this very reason. We love dancing and the fact she wants us to just sit there and not join in the dancing all night long makes both my husband and I a little uncomfortable. He has suggested we just wait till everyone has a few drinks in them and then join in the dancing when it wont be noticed but I worry this could make us assholes as she's asked us to not dance. That being said what else would we do after the meal? as it's going to be hours and hours of dancing. The only thing I can think of beyond that is that we simply leave after the meal but I don't want to seem like we're angry either.\n\nEdit: We have sent off some texts to non dancer friends who have seen us dance at weddings/we've danced at their weddings and asked if they felt we were attention grabbing or too flashy when we danced. They were confused about why we're asking but assured us they never noticed anything like that.", "created_utc": 1693978361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bbq28/wibta_if_i_danced_at_my_friends_wedding_despite/", "score": 995, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should speak with her again and share with her how you feel. There is traditionally a first dance for the married couple, so I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t have their big moment then and allow y\u2019all to dance while everyone else is. Y\u2019all really need to have another conversation and clarify what is expected.

You taught them to dance and a whole routine, and they (or just she) are so sensitive about their skills that they are worried that you and your husband dancing normally would steal attention away. That hurts. And sounds boring. And also hard to do... at least as someone who danced for many, many years and is not ballroom professional, but dancing is just what I do instinctively (seriously I have not noticed myself dancing before), and to be told to not do it AT ALL would be... yikes.

There's two competing issues: 1) your friend's patently unreasonable request to you versus 2) what she explicitly asked for on her wedding day.

That's immensely and ironically selfish. Maybe she'll see the light.", "NTA I\u2019m so confused why people think the wedding should be \ud83d\udcaf their control/dream.

I hope they paid you!! NTA if it was me I wouldn\u2019t turn up. Now you know how they really feel about you.", "Your friends are the assholes. To ask people who clearly love the couple enough to give free dance lessons not to dance is absurd. However, I\u2019d just decline to go altogether.

For them to ask you to not participate in the most celebratory part of the actual party is selfish on their part.", "NTA that\u2019s ridiculous that you\u2019re not allowed to just do the same normal dancing that everyone else will be doing.", "That\u2019s very unreasonable of her and is saddening because it seems like you guys are good enough friends that you and you husband are teaching them for their first dance. I would be so hurt and rightfully so. Maybe just do the dinner and leave if it was me I don\u2019t know if I would want to go at all. But I definitely would not dance if she specifically asked you not to. The petty me wouldn\u2019t go at all or I would go and sit there and when someone asks I would tell them the bride specifically asked us not to and if she\u2019s mad about that she knows how ridiculous it is to even ask that of you.", "This is how I'm envisioning OP and spouse...\nhttps://youtu.be/NIDabDkcS8o?si=HCRpTwbnx21nJQ74\n\nYou're only the AH if you whip out those clicky clamshell things.", "Tell friend you won't be attending the dance since you're not allowed to dance.

They are always being discussed, congratulated, etc.  If I had not witnessed this myself, I would probably say the bride is the AH.

Skip the wedding.", "So you will get a little bit of joy out of dancing at the wedding at the cost of annoying the bride a great deal.

I'm pretty sure the bride is worried that when the other guests see you dancing way better, they will leave the dancefloor or even leave the wedding early due to lack of fun for them. \n\nIts like if you do regular pot lucks and one of the attendee is a professional cook - the others will start not bringing anything anymore or straight out not coming anymore bc they don't want to be compared to a professional. \n\nSure, ppl shouldn't be so insecure, but the sad fact is they are.", "YWBTA. I used to dance seriously - as in pay for weekly personal lessons with someone who was not just a pro but probably one of the best teachers in the country. After a couple of years of serious practice, I was probably good enough to teach. There is no way you're going to be able to hide the fact that you're competitive ballroom dancers. There's going to be a smoothness and intuitiveness to your dancing that will stand out to at least some people. But more to the point, can you not suck up your hurt feelings for just a few hours? Your friend is hopefully only going to have one wedding and whilst I agree that she's being ridiculous, it is her wedding. She's not asking you to cut a limb off or shave your heads. Just don't dance for a couple of hours. I mean, the humanity!!! Don't burn a friendship over this. If you still have itchy feet, find a club to go to after the reception or dance at home. There will be plenty of other opportunities to dance later. Take one for the team.

Considering the hourly rate for private lessons it was probably a generous gift, but that still doesn't equal the bride \"using\" OP or being spoilt. It was a gift, without strings attached. \n\n(I don't find the request reasonable, but that doesn't mean we've got to paint the bride in the worst colours imaginable.)", "[deleted]", "FR. Sounds like she had a psychotic break and should be seen to by professionals.", "it's okay i had an omg moment bc i read the boru recently. like \"omg hey me me me! i can send the link!!!! i know this one\"", "Oh I would be talking about how much a shame it is that I can't join them on the dance floor even if I wasn't asked", "That's exactly what I embroidered! Lovely, it is (well, the pic, not my embroidery).", "I mean, of all the times to fall into \"main character syndrome\", one's own wedding is surely the most justifiable. \n\nEven most commenters here seem to agree it's reasonable for the bride to expect OP to not do any choreographed number that would make them stand out. \n\nI'm not even really disagreeing with you, this bride definitely has some insecurity here. Just adding that it's OK for the bride to want to be main character on a day she's spending thousands on... within reason.", "Accepting the lessons and then saying that the person giving you free lessons isn\u2019t allowed to dance at the event they\u2019re giving you lessons FOR actually is the bride using them and being spoilt. If you are going to ban professional dancers from dancing at your wedding but still want to use their free labor and lessons, you are using them. If she knew from the beginning that she didn\u2019t want OP and her husband dancing at the wedding, the bride should have turned down the free lessons.", "Have you ever been to a wedding? You realize *everyone* dances right, not just the professionals or amateurs?", "This is actually strange; I feel like we're having two different conversations.

And yes, I agree the timing is suspicious. Bride definitely wanted her free lessons before she risked upsetting OP. \n\nI would maybe sit around looking bored for a bit until someone asked why we weren't dancing, tell them \"I'm not allowed\" while grabbing my purse (i usually carry a purse for meds but not everyone would have one i gyess) then leave, but maybe I'm to witchy and petty.", "We've been friends since Highschool. It's why i'm completely lost with this. She knows very well we can hold back when needed and I always trusted if she had any issues she'd come to me about it.", "Thank you so much.

Once you have had a minute to process it, you could go back to her and say something like:\n\n\u2018Hey, I picked up from your comments about us dancing at your wedding that you\u2019re worried about things not going perfectly. I\u2019d love to chat some more about what\u2019s going on for you and give you some space to vent if that\u2019s what you need\u2019 and then hear her out. She may well be feeling like other parts of her wedding planning are out of control or there\u2019s something else going on and this is the one thing she can try and grab some control over. But you don\u2019t know unless you actually ask. \n\nHer request has put you in a situation where you are going to come off as the arseholes whatever you do, which is not a great thing to do to a friend. If it\u2019s uncharacteristic, which is what it sounds like, then there\u2019s something else up."]}
