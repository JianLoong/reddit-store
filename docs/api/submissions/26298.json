My friend is getting married and as a wedding gift my husband and I have been giving my friend and her husband to be private dance lessons for their first dance. Three times a week we meet up with them for an hour to work on their routine. They have really improved and we feel they are ready for their first dance and beyond meeting us to practice their routine and keep it locked in they don't need anything else. \n\nToday my friend admitted to me that she doesn't want me and my husband dancing at her reception as she feels it would steal the attention away from her and her husband as this is our job and we'll always be so much better than them. I was quick to assure her that we had no intention of doing anything even resembling a routine and at most we'd just be having fun or doing a slow dance but she wasn't happy with this and claimed that with how we move together even that would be too much. \n\nI'm honestly shocked by this and more than a little hurt. We can easily tone it down to a normal standard of dancing and do so all the time at things like weddings for this very reason. We love dancing and the fact she wants us to just sit there and not join in the dancing all night long makes both my husband and I a little uncomfortable. He has suggested we just wait till everyone has a few drinks in them and then join in the dancing when it wont be noticed but I worry this could make us assholes as she's asked us to not dance. That being said what else would we do after the meal? as it's going to be hours and hours of dancing. The only thing I can think of beyond that is that we simply leave after the meal but I don't want to seem like we're angry either.\n\nEdit: We have sent off some texts to non dancer friends who have seen us dance at weddings/we've danced at their weddings and asked if they felt we were attention grabbing or too flashy when we danced. They were confused about why we're asking but assured us they never noticed anything like that.", "created_utc": 1693978361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bbq28/wibta_if_i_danced_at_my_friends_wedding_despite/", "score": 2161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should speak with her again and share with her how you feel. There is traditionally a first dance for the married couple, so I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t have their big moment then and allow y\u2019all to dance while everyone else is. Y\u2019all really need to have another conversation and clarify what is expected.

You taught them to dance and a whole routine, and they (or just she) are so sensitive about their skills that they are worried that you and your husband dancing normally would steal attention away. That hurts. And sounds boring. And also hard to do... at least as someone who danced for many, many years and is not ballroom professional, but dancing is just what I do instinctively (seriously I have not noticed myself dancing before), and to be told to not do it AT ALL would be... yikes.

There's two competing issues: 1) your friend's patently unreasonable request to you versus 2) what she explicitly asked for on her wedding day.

Because of that, it's the softest possible YWBTA (by a fraction of a millimeter).\n\nBut all is not lost. I would tell her right up front that you and your husband won't be staying past dinner. Why? Because you find it hurtful that she is explicitly excluding you from the party and commanding you not to enjoy yourselves by doing the very thing she asked you to teach her. That's immensely and ironically selfish. Maybe she'll see the light.", "NTA I\u2019m so confused why people think the wedding should be \ud83d\udcaf their control/dream.

If I were you I would sit there and look as miserable and bored as possible every time she glances over.", "So they used you for your skill and now they don\u2019t want you to dance at all at their wedding? I hope they paid you!! NTA if it was me I wouldn\u2019t turn up. Now you know how they really feel about you.", "Your friends are the assholes. To ask people who clearly love the couple enough to give free dance lessons not to dance is absurd. However, I\u2019d just decline to go altogether. I\u2019m no where near a professional dancer but dancing at a wedding reception is the best part! For them to ask you to not participate in the most celebratory part of the actual party is selfish on their part.", "NTA that\u2019s ridiculous that you\u2019re not allowed to just do the same normal dancing that everyone else will be doing.", "That\u2019s very unreasonable of her and is saddening because it seems like you guys are good enough friends that you and you husband are teaching them for their first dance. I would be so hurt and rightfully so. Maybe just do the dinner and leave if it was me I don\u2019t know if I would want to go at all. But I definitely would not dance if she specifically asked you not to. The petty me wouldn\u2019t go at all or I would go and sit there and when someone asks I would tell them the bride specifically asked us not to and if she\u2019s mad about that she knows how ridiculous it is to even ask that of you.", "This is how I'm envisioning OP and spouse...\nhttps://youtu.be/NIDabDkcS8o?si=HCRpTwbnx21nJQ74\n\nYou're only the AH if you whip out those clicky clamshell things.", "Tell friend you won't be attending the dance since you're not allowed to dance.

They are always being discussed, congratulated, etc.  If I had not witnessed this myself, I would probably say the bride is the AH.

Skip the wedding.", "So you will get a little bit of joy out of dancing at the wedding at the cost of annoying the bride a great deal.

I'm pretty sure the bride is worried that when the other guests see you dancing way better, they will leave the dancefloor or even leave the wedding early due to lack of fun for them. \n\nIts like if you do regular pot lucks and one of the attendee is a professional cook - the others will start not bringing anything anymore or straight out not coming anymore bc they don't want to be compared to a professional. \n\nSure, ppl shouldn't be so insecure, but the sad fact is they are.", "YWBTA. I used to dance seriously - as in pay for weekly personal lessons with someone who was not just a pro but probably one of the best teachers in the country. After a couple of years of serious practice, I was probably good enough to teach. There is no way you're going to be able to hide the fact that you're competitive ballroom dancers. There's going to be a smoothness and intuitiveness to your dancing that will stand out to at least some people. But more to the point, can you not suck up your hurt feelings for just a few hours? Your friend is hopefully only going to have one wedding and whilst I agree that she's being ridiculous, it is her wedding. She's not asking you to cut a limb off or shave your heads. Just don't dance for a couple of hours. I mean, the humanity!!! Don't burn a friendship over this. If you still have itchy feet, find a club to go to after the reception or dance at home. There will be plenty of other opportunities to dance later. Take one for the team.

That being said, it does seem like someone stealing the spotlight from the bride during a wedding is pretty common based on all the reddit posts about it.\n\nI suggest letting it go and living with it. You can survive one event without dancing. Who knows? It's possible someone will ask why you two aren't dancing and you can tell them they need to ask the bride and groom that. If word gets out, they may relent to not seem like the assholes instead of you.", "Don\u2019t ballroom dance.

They literally just shuffled around to the beat, and yet all the aunties came to their table asked them if they dance. A sense of rythm and standing up straight apparently is enough to identify dancers.", "Yeah it\u2019s nuts. I would have loved to have seen something like that at my own wedding.

Hopefully OP is better than that, much as they enjoy the activity.", "They don't even have to say they were sad if they don't want (theres nothing wrong worth that approach though.) There's just nothing to do during the dance portion of a wedding if you're not dancing, except have a chat with nana.\n\n\"We left when the activities we were allowed to do ended\"\n\n\"We left when the dancing started, as to not draw attention to us not dancing\"\n\n\"We left after dinner, we didn't think you'd miss us on the dance floor\"\n\n\"We were under the impression we weren't welcome/invited to the dance portion\"\n\nThere are a lot of responses that leave you the bigger person.

I could see that misunderstanding as a more charitable interpretation that's easier for you to address.\n\nYou keep saying you haven't done it before and ALWAYS Scale back but this comment illustrates that's not true. It was COMPLETELY appropriate given the venue and audience but is it possible she's mostly seen you at dance weddings versus scaled back ones?\n\nMaybe offer that framing and she may have a lightbulb.", "This isn't about you or rationality.  Your friend is insecure and put a lot of work in.  She asked you something that seems small ro her, but large to you.  She's letting fear and anxiety win, and logic isn't going to fight that battle.i am sorry this is happening.", "So what is the bride going to say when people ask who taught them to dance? Point to the people sitting in the corner and say 'those two professional dancers'? She realises this is going to cause more gossip than you slow dancing right? She hasn't thought this through.

In fact you won't even participate in the wedding ceremony in case you pay attention too nicely so you'll ignore her and scroll through reddit during the vows. But I'm very well balanced....with a chip on both shoulders.

That one was wild", "The idea that they have to plan an event that is unique, memorable, expresses their personality and relationship, while being classic and timeless, and trendy and meeting the expectations of all of their family and friends.\n\nThe internal expectations are both too high and contradictory, so impossible to meet. So they\u2019re doing a ton of work while feeling like they are failing, on something that is Super Important and doesn\u2019t get any do overs.\n\nI basically accept that people planning a wedding are temporarily insane.", "I agree with this! Definitely a strange request by the bride, but not worth the drama as it is only one night of not dancing. As a compromise, maybe explain your fear of feeling awkward while everyone else is dancing and ask if she minds if you and your husband dance during group dances or with other people (not as a couple). \n\nI think a little communication between both of you can help clarify boundaries and expectations. And remember, even though not dancing seems silly to you, her insecurities may be real and this is a big day for her. I think she needs to be willing to compromise, but I would also make sure she knows that you understand where she is coming from and that you don\u2019t want to steal her spotlight, but you also want to enjoy her special day with her.", "Like half or more of the fun of a wedding is dancing with your friends. Yeah it is a huge ask. I would not go to a wedding if I was asked to stay off the dance floor.

That crazy b lost her whole damn mind.", "Hell, there are some songs that I swear I've heard at like 90% of wedding I've ever attended.

You're proposing an odd flex / threat of being like if I can't do exactly what I want at your wedding, well you just won't get the pleasure of my company!!\n\nThis is such narcisstic advice as though a bride and groom are spending their wedding day consumed with worry about what time OP is going to leave.
