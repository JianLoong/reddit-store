Your stepgrandparents fail to see that you already don't have a sibling. Your stepsister made that very clear 10 years ago. \n\nIt doesn't look like she has no support so I don't understand the insistence on putting you in a place where you have to be in an uncomfortable situation for someone who hurt you.

Given your stepsister's outright statements, what even makes them think your presence would be welcomed by her? They are thinking that this girl would be appreciative of your olive branch.  When in fact, I think the girl has a personality disorder to be so callous towards you and maintain this feeling since the sibling was born.  You are definitely better off not trying to do what they ask because frankly, I think it would make you a target of her ire.
