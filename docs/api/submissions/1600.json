Your stepgrandparents fail to see that you already don't have a sibling. Your stepsister made that very clear 10 years ago. \n\nIt doesn't look like she has no support so I don't understand the insistence on putting you in a place where you have to be in an uncomfortable situation for someone who hurt you.

Given your stepsister's outright statements, what even makes them think your presence would be welcomed by her? They are thinking that this girl would be appreciative of your olive branch.

You are definitely better off not trying to do what they ask because frankly, I think it would make you a target of her ire.

But she's not.  I think you were smart not to go.  Don't give their words a second thought.  And block their phone number on your phone. There is no reason to speak with them if this is what they are going to do.", "Nta. You aren't treating her like a sister because she made it abundantly clear she neither considered you one nor wanted you to be one. You are simply following her wishes.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA", "NTA", "NTA - See... the thing about relationships... is that we get back what we put in.\n\nYour step-sister used you, said things to you she should never have said, treated you so poorly her own mother started apologizing on her behalf, and groomed the poor relationship she currently has with you. She actively encouraged you to peace out from knowing her at all.\n\nIf her grandparents want her to have 'love and support', they should focus on teaching her how to *GIVE* some. You aren't a backup sibling. A spare. You aren't her emotional support stepsister. You are essentially a stranger/neighbor that happens to share a house with her. Unless she is going knocking door-to-door begging others for attention, she doesn't need yours. And if she did, it would be **HER** coming to you to apologize and ask forgiveness.\n\nUntil she does that, other people can supplement her needs.", "INFO if you lost someone you loved, would her being there and offering support make it easier on you", "NTA - Don't guilt trip yourself. Your stepsister made it clear where she stood and should not expect anything from you.", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry her grandparents are pushing you to go - does step sister even want you there - I would think your presence would upset her even more.", "Nta, it\u2019s an unfortunate situation but the good thing about this whole story is that it sounds like you have an amazing step mom. Maybe deep down that\u2019s your step sisters problem. Jealousy of seeing her mom treat someone else as an equal. Don\u2019t worry about what the grand parents think. Some old people think because they are old that everyone should do as they say. Don\u2019t do what you don\u2019t want to do.", "NAH\n\nGoing to a funeral is not only about the deceased, but also about the people left behind. It seems you have a great relationship with your SM. It would probably mean a lot for her if you went to support HER, but I can understand your reasons for not wanting to.", "Nta . But this isn't about the evil stepsister, it's about the daughter who died, who was also a step sister. Avoid the one you hate, and go to the funeral to support your stepparents and the person who died. And completely ignore the evil stepsister.", "I think I should wear my glasses... I read that as \" who does not want a crocodile\" .. I curse my old lady eyes sometimes. \n\nHowever.. op... NTA. Stepsister didn't want you when you were kids .. she  does not deserve you now ..", "Right? Your stepmom is a real one and clearly loves you. She went to bat for you against her own parents. That's a really big deal. Trust that woman. \n\nNTA", "I was thinking the same thing. How does a 5 year old come up with a plan to pretend to be friends/sisters and do it for TWO YEARS??That\u2019s some long con that I can\u2019t imagine a kid coming up with, not to mention what a weird thing to even think about doing in the first place. Her dad and his wife were definitely in her ear about them having a baby and how it\u2019s her REAL sister. \n\nOP is NTA. The step-grandparents are being manipulative by guilting her into going because that\u2019s what they want, and don\u2019t give a crap about OP\u2019s feelings or wellbeing. When I feel like someone is calling me names (petty, spiteful), it makes me want to dig my heels in even more cuz I don\u2019t want to give them the satisfaction of bullying me into doing what they want. Hmm.. maybe I AM spiteful \ud83e\udd14", "Yeah, even if the sister said it, she was mad about something and trying to hurt OP", "I do not think OP's stepsister cares what OP does. It seems the maternal grandparents are the instigators of the whole brouhaha.", "We don't talk so I don't know. It wouldn't change much for me given the relationship is too far gone to ever salvage.", "It's not SM's child. It's the child of SM's ex and his current wife.", "idk why SM would need support", "She has nothing to do with her stepsisters halfsister.", "But the stepmother is only going to support her daughter. Stepmother does not need OP's support because it was not her child who died. It was her ex-husband's child.", "The child who died was not related to me or to my stepmom and dad. She's the child of my stepmom's ex husband with his current wife.", "But the half-sister is NOTHING to OP. Half-sister of the step-sister is the daughter of OP's father's wife's ex-husband with his present wife.\n\nIn other words, the child in question is not related to OP, her stepmother or the stepmother's parents. The only person the child was related to was OP's stepsister. OP's parents and step-grandparents are attending to support OP's stepsister.", "If you really feel that way, I suggest not going and blocking all those criticizing and harassing you.", "She made it clear. You are simply following her request. If her pushy grandparents want that to change, that change starts with her, not with you.\n\nWhy would you show up at the funeral of someone you don't know, to \"Be ThErE\" for someone you have zero relationship with at her own request??? It's ridiculous at best, callous at worst (for the actual grieving family members).\n\nNo, you don't belong at that funeral. They can drag in someone off the street and that person'd have more reason to attend and support than you would, frankly.", "NTA.  Stepsister might actually be pissed at your \"Nosing your way in\" even though that wouldn't be your intention.  I'd avoid it as well.", "You don't have to follow their double standards. It's never the hurt/innocent party's duty to facilitate reconciliation. NTA", "Bingo. Don't treat anyone like family if they don't treat you like family. You learned a valuable lesson about your step grandparents and should keep it in mind moving forward.", "NTA.  Here is how I handle these situations.  1.  What does your gut say?   2.  Would it hurt you to go?   3.  What is the downside of going?   4.  Do you go to support your step mom?   Take care of yourself\u2014but think about your motivation for your decision.  Only you know the right answer.  (I think the grandparents are fools\u2014you going won\u2019t heal/fix) the relationship.", "You are giving her the support she deserves. So, check!  NTA.", "Are they aware that being a sister isn\u2019t a light switch? You vacant must turn the relationship on and off as you please. They need to listen to their own daughter and leave you alone\u2026", "Does your stepsister even want your love and support here? It sounds like her grandparents want what they think is best for her, but honestly, it kinda sounds like having you there may not be what she wants or needs. \n\nKudos to your dad and stepmom for standing up for you. It would be different if this desire for support was coming from one of the inner circles of grief (i.e. your stepsister herself), but as it is you are NTA as long as you are kind to your stepsister when you do interact while she is grieving.", "She already has more than she deserves.\n\nYou're good, sorry your step sister sucks. My bio sister sucks. Now we are both adults in our 30s and it's my fault we are not close. (She is still very rude and unpleasant to me so ...no) \n\nI'm cordial but that's all. I don't have her number saved in my phone and don't know where she lives. My life is so much more peaceful since I stopped caring.", "That because it only works if it triggers social pressure. Ultimately the person stops the behavior out of self preservation more than anything", "So original context is even better! Or at least, this is what I was taught.\n\nBasically, you could only slap with your right hand, the left was unclean. you could only use the back of your hand on your slaves, so if you used your palm, then they were you equal and thus free. So by turning you other cheek, your master was either forced to stop hitting you or acknowledge your freedom. It was a form of civil disobedience \n\n\u201cGoing the extra mile\u201d is another form of civil disobedience, as well.", "Yeah, even if she did want you there, you still have no obligation to attend, but sometimes losing someone close  to you makes you rethink your relationship with the people around you.

I'm not sure it would hurt me but it would be very awkward for me. My stepmom is only going to support her daughter.

Don't go. Block all of these people who are harassing you. Keep your stepmother/father informed if they keep trying to contact you. If stepsister berates you, keep your parents informed. Go no contact with stepsister as soon as you can.", "I think it\u2019s best to follow your gut, but it really depends on if you think you will regret not going. By the way, your responses show you are a very kind and caring person. This only child would have loved having you as a sister. And as I\u2019m adopted, blood ties mean very little to me."]}
