Tell your stepmother to please ask them to go through her only from now on.\n2. The hypocrisy stinks - their granddaughter is nether a true good person or true sister.

Believe her.\n\nWhy do people always expect the jilted, hurt party to be the bigger person? Where is any form of apology, or of simply acknowledging the hurt caused?!\n\nYour stepmom\u2019s parents are acting just like your stepsister. Perhaps the apple fell an extra generation from this tree.", "NTA.  Please maintain your boundaries with her.", "I think you're NTA. She hurt you, and you shouldn't feel obligated to go to the funeral. Stepmoms parents shouldn't guilt trip you into going, but there's a point in what they said, maybe you're acting out of spite, which I understand, since she has hurt you so much. I can't imagine what it's been like for you, I only have young step siblings, and both of them cried their eyes out when someone told them I wasn't their sister. She decided your relationship was nothing, and maybe she was just young and didn't know better, but even if you go, there's no way of telling how she will take it.\n\nJust want to add that it seems to me that your Stepmom is a really great person, I'm glad for that", "Nta", "Info. I don\u2019t quite understand the dynamic here. How did you come to be stepsisters? Is her dad\u2019s wife (and mother of the child who died) not your stepmother?", "Definitely NTA. It's a random kids funeral.", "NTA: she has made it clear that you are nothing to her and you have nothing to do with the half-sister. So her grandparents need to shut it, and the people who need to be there for her will be there. \n\nPlus, if that isn\u2019t her only half sibling, she has other siblings that will be in the same boat as her.", "Nta.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss of your sister. It must feel horrible to be rejected like that. \n\nIf you don't want to go don't go. \n\nAlso: I love your stepmun, she sounds great.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou reap what you sew in life. Your stepmoms parents are nothing to you. Don\u2019t give their words any meaning at all. They didn\u2019t care when you were being hurt daily by your step sister. But now there\u2019s a crisis, you suddenly matter? They\u2019re just trying yet again to make everyone fall into a caring position for your step sister. That ship has sailed. Screw them all. Do not go.\nEdit to add a missing word", "NTA", "Nta. She made it clear that you are nothing but a step sibiling and related only through marriage. She doesn't deserve your support. Also all those people harassing a kid are pathetic so keep that in mind when debating whether to vale their \"opinions\" or not.", "NTA she treats you like shit then expects you to support her? She sounds like a narcissist. If you're not interested in reconciliation then you have no need to go the the funeral", "NTA\n\nYour stepsister is likely to ignore you at the funeral in any case. Her grandparents may be looking forward to a tearful reconciliation between you two at the graveside but you needn't play into their desire for drama. She isn't your only sibling, you get to create your sisterhood around you. \n\nI know she's burned her bridges with you, but she may want to reach out one of those days you are home together. Your dad and stepmum would be close at hand for support, and this sad loss may have made her grow up a little about what family really means.", "NTA. Just keep telling them that your stepsister is the one who made it crystal clear that you\u2019re not a true sister. And then block them. You don\u2019t need their negative energy. Don\u2019t engage with them", "Attend the funeral though. It's for a child that died. Any child's death is a tragedy. It's not for your step sister, it's for the child that died.", "NTA. It would be good to be there for your family as a whole - not for the stepsister. If your bio parent is going then you should go, plus your step mother seems like a good parent to you. So I would do it for them.", "It's probably even more than that. They care about their bio granddaughter and want her to have all the support and love and don't really care about how she treated me. As long as she gets the love and support she deserves.", "I guess it's meant to be the gesture that changes things or something. The problem is we reached the point already where I no longer have an interest in reconciling. She's made it clear that I'm nothing to her.", "She's my stepsister, not my half sister. It's her half sister who passed away. Sorry if that was confusing!", "My stepmom is great. Most of my friends say she's so different to their stepparents who would never have been understanding about the rejection and not liking their kid. But she always felt so bad and never pushed me to try and win her daughter over. Or shamed me for staying out of her daughter's way after what happened.", "No, she's not. Her mom is married to my dad and is not related to the child who died in any way.", "It looks like bio dad married divorced woman (stepmother) and stepmothers ex-husband married another woman (came to be her sister stepmother and the kid mother)", "I have nothing to do with the child who died. I don't normally go to funerals for kids who died if I don't know them.", "Is it OK to show up on random kids funerals now? Every death is sad, funerals are supposed to be for the ones grieving the person passing, dead people don't really care. Which OP is not. Which may lead to her being called an hypocrite, since she had no relation with the kid", "It sounds like she has all the love and support she's ever wanted.", "Tell them that life is no Disney movie. Sometimes big gestures blow up in our face, and in this case, if you put any hopes of reconciliation and she again rejects you, you'll be hurting AGAIN.", "Then there you go. It's your conscience anyways, don't let them guilt trip you, just do what you feel is right for you.", "Thanks!\n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA.", "That makes sense, thanks! My brain is tired this morning", "It's OK, family trees are getting trickier"]}
