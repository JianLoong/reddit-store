Your stepgrandparents fail to see that you already don't have a sibling. Your stepsister made that very clear 10 years ago. \n\nIt doesn't look like she has no support so I don't understand the insistence on putting you in a place where you have to be in an uncomfortable situation for someone who hurt you. I get that she's hurting but they shouldn't invalidate your feelings about it either.  Honestly, I'm sick of the \"you have to be the bigger person and reconcile\" narrative. I'm sorry but no, you don't get to tell me when I should stop feeling wronged about something/someone. \n\nI'm sorry for your stepsis, I really am, but unless she specifically asked you to please be there (along with an apology or the promise to talk it out at some point), I don't see the point of being there for \"fake\" support when you clearly don't want to just because \"ShE Is FAaAAmILy\"", "You are NTA and I\u2019d honestly just cut off communication with the stepmom\u2019s parents - at least for now. You owe them nothing and they\u2019ll keep hounding you about this because they are definitely assholes. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry you had that childhood experience. I had close friends turn around and start to bully me when I was a kid (which isn\u2019t half as awful as someone you saw as a sister doing it) and it still lingers with me as a middle-aged dude. \n\nI wish you all the best and hope you get the chance to cut the mean people out of your life like I did. \n\nI\u2019m so glad your stepmom stood up for you tho, she seems like a good person.", "NTA. Congrats for standing up for yourself. Don't let them bully you. I'm glad your stepmom backs you up.", "you dont need me to tell you Im proud of the boundaries you are setting in such a high emotion situation.  Nta.  People use intense times to provoke action from others they arent willing to do themselves.  Your stepsis is a real jerk for no reason, that we know.  Maybe she overheard her mom or other person say they liked you better or talking about you in a way that she felt less than.  it is no excuse for treating you as such, but if she felt rejected at some point it might explain her behavior toward you.  setting those strong boundaries protect you from her actions.", "NTA. \n\nShe treated you horribly and, by her own admission, used you to fulfill her needs for a sister, then dumped you. \n\nShe owes you an apology followed by actions that say how sorry she really is. You're not the one who is obligated to \"step-up\" and try to repair a relationship you had nothing to do with destroying. You're not the one who should be taking the first steps here. She hasn't even said she wants you to be a part of her life. Why would you be obligated to open yourself up to her cruelty?\n\nYou said no, then the flyeing- monkeys in the form of her grandparents started to harass and guilt a 17 year old.

I\u2019m glad you have supportive parents but the grandparents were really out of line to call and lecture you.
