If I am unable to sleep at all, my blood pressure will reach stroke levels, this has been tested and proven multiple times by both my doctor and I. Also I'm not comfortable sleeping in an area where anyone can just walk past me. (She's bringing her boyfriend of like 2 months, whom any of us barely know)\n\nShe told me I could just get a hotel room (paying nearly 10 times what I would have to pay at the cabin) or 'suck it up'. \n\nI contacted my older brother, who is actually planning the trip, and told him my concerns. He said it was perfectly reasonable for me to ask for a private room, and that he would keep that in mind. \n\nNow twin thinks im an asshole because it could raise the sum of money each person would have to pay, and threatening to find a way to exclude me from family trips. \n\nEdit for info: \n1. No cost has been set in stone, but it's known we'll need at least 3 rooms, but the goal is that everyone gets their own room. Twin would just prefer only the older people get rooms so it's cheaper. MY TWIN IS THE ONLY ONE WILLING TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR. \n\n2. As far as I know, twin has no physical medical conditions, but I wouldn't know. \n\n3. This trip may not even happen. Excuse parents aren't sure if they'd be able to get time off, so it's all up in the air. \n\nEDIT TWO: \nEveryone is paying the same amount of money regardless of who gets a room and who sleeps on the floor. Twin wants young people to sleep on the floor to lower the cost per person. She is the only one that feels this way \n\n\nEdit Three: \n\nTalked to my brother. There's 10 people he wants to go. \nMeaning max twin would have to pay is like 200-400 and she has ample time to save, given brother is confirming whether the trip is happening tomorrow. Trip isn't going to be scheduled until probably early october, so she has months to save. \n\nAiTa?", "created_utc": 1688239203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o38vx/aita_for_requesting_a_private_room_on_a_family/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whether or not you think she can afford it or should be able to afford it isn't the issue.  She doesn't want to spend as much on this trip.   You've told your brother what budget you are comfortable with and that you want a room for that amount.  She should tell your brother the amount she is comfortable with and that she's willing to sleep on the floor/sofa/whatever, and your brother should be able to accommodate both of you.  Arranging family trips can be a headache, but personally I think each person telling me up front what they're comfortable with and what they're not makes the whole process easier.", "Of course!

You might have an arrangement then be offered the floor upon arrival.", "Whether others would ask for the difference is irrelevant. Your desires should not affect their finances.

Expecting you to pay more for a bedroom while she sleeps on the floor is perfectly reasonable.     \n\n\nAgain, I don't understand the trend of 'dividing it up by person' when it's clear that means some people are subsidizing others.  If she's sleeping on the floor, she should pay less.  If a group goes out to dinner and one person has a salad and water while others have a full meal and drinks. that person should pay less.   It makes no sense to expect your sister to pay the same for sleeping on the floor as you pay for a bedroom, nor is it reasonable to insist she pay for and have a bedroom if she's not comfortable with that expenditure.   (unless there's a good reason.  For me, that 'we barely know him' boyfriend is a good reason.

Everyone is putting in the same amount of money, twin is the only one that wants the younger people to sleep on the floor\n\nEveryone else wants their own rooms. \nShe's basically trying to convince me and my husband that it would be better to sleep on the floor.", "It's not a demand, it is a request. \nI don't think it's asinine to need a bed?", "maybe she\u2019s having financial issues, have you tried to ask her why she\u2019s so against it ?", "Maybe suggest she just sleep in a tent outside & pay nothing.", "makes perfect sense and is reasonable.", ">Everyone is putting in the same amount of money\n\nAdd this to your post, it's relevant", "It is a demand\u2026 You\u2019re demanding a bed for yourself and expecting others to pay.", "She has quite the alcohol/w33d problem, \nAnd she parties/goes to bars a lot from what I know.", "I don't know what her financial issues are, but she does live with our parents who pay all her bills, and she has a job. \n\nTo me, it sounds like she's not willing to save or cut back on drinking to save up, but I don't know her exact situation.", "When I mentioned 'intimate' time, she suggested going out into the woods. \n\nSo I think she would like that.", "Gotcha", "NTA. You have a medical issue that requires a bed. You are willing to pay for a bed.  If your twin wants to sleep on the floor, have at it.  I would imagine, after the second night, she will be trying to get into your room.", "NTA. Even if you didn't have medical needs, four people sleeping in the living room means that the older generation, the ones most likely to be getting up early, won't be able to use the living room until everyone's up. And depending on the layout of the cabin, they might not be able to use the kitchen without waking everyone. It's one thing if you all had extremely tight budgets or it was some sort of emergency, but this is meant to be a vacation, not an exercise in austerity.", "NTA\n\nIf it was that the 'kids' were 12 and under sleeping in the sitting room on the floor could be a cool adventure but one over 13 anybody deserves a room and a bed.\n\nI do wonder if it's worth the stress for you to attend this holiday though", "I think splitting things equally and ignoring the reality of people's financial situations is kind of an AH tradition, even though it's not malicious. Few 23 year olds can afford to pay the same as their parents and grandparents. And even if they can, if your twin is willing to pay less to be less comfortable, why wouldn't that be allowed? Why not let her choose less money for less comfort? I'm not saying YTA since you are surely not solely in charge, but it's not a great way to be inclusive.", "I'm not in charge, my brother is, and he says everyone is getting a bed an paying the same amount regardless of what twin wants basically.", "You're an adult, you can say \"I think twin should be allowed to pay less and we get a place with less space for her\".", "She is also an adult, and can express that to our brother. \nI'm not going to speak for her, she's already made requests to our brother including being able to bring her cat and so on, so she's able to express what she wants. \n\nIf brother said no, he said no.", "NTA but an easy way to get twin off your back is to let her pay less than everyone else\u2019s share (or even charge her little to nothing) because she is willing to not have a room.", "This is excruciating. Way too much trouble. Just stay home or plan. You\u2019re on vacation.", "Yeah, I had to read pretty far to figure out that the \u201ckids\u201d are adults in their 20s. At first I was guessing that twin had kids and op didn\u2019t  so twin was being an A H and claiming that childless people don\u2019t deserve beds. NTA, you deserve a bed, and the cost should be divided either by bed or by room, not equally by all regardless of accommodations used.", "This isn't an option, everyone that is coming has to pay\n \nIt's not my rule, it's my brother's\n Out of all of us, she has no bills to pay and no one to look after but herself since she lives with our parents and they pay for everything. \n\nMy brother has made it clear that if our mom or anyone tries to pay for her, they will be charged extra. She needs to pay for this herself.", "I'm not missing the only family vacation we've ever gone on.", "Pretty entitled of her to assume that everyone would be eager to sleep on the floor for her own convenience.

Not everyone is guaranteed", "I am the broke sister and I would have no problem sleeping on the floor.", "It\u2019s weird that this rule that everyone pays the same amount is set in stone though and that your brother apparently has final say over everything. There\u2019s no reason that everyone who wants and is willing to pay for a private room can have one, and anyone who is willing to crash on the floor can come for just the cost of their food plus a much smaller share of the house rental price. Why is that not even being considered?", "Because there will be enough beds for everyone, and all of us will have a designated area. \n\nMy brother knows that cost is an issue with her, but that doesn't mean that the rest of us should have to pay more because of her. \n\nThat's just kinda how it's going. \n\nNo one is getting the floor, that's a definite."]}
