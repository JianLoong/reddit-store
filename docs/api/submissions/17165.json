She cried. Some people assumed it was bratty but I don\u2019t, I think she likely realized she was wrong and it was more serious to you than she realized. As such this could be a deeper issue- whereas a normal person might just apologize and move on, maybe she thinks that it\u2019s weird to apologize now because she didn\u2019t realize she was THAT out of line? Again, she cried. She is at least non-confrontational which is\u2026not consistent with being ok seeing your BIL poop. And is consistent on a social event being urgent. You asked if you should move on- yes. Because she cried. But you aren\u2019t wrong for wanting an apology.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand the concept of key for emergencies. My family doesn\u2019t get one. People who get keys often feel entitled to use them. \n\nI would take it back.

I doubt you\u2019ll get an apology from her. Change your locks", "NTA. She should have respected your boundaries especially as it was non-emergency. She took advantage of getting the key to your place for emergencies and used it for her convenience. Getting a \"real apology\" is pointless at this point I'm afraid. She still doesn't realize what's wrong with her behavior or pretending that she doesn't, and her behavior or attitude is unlikely to change even if she offered an apology. Simply change the lock and put healthy distance between yourself and your SIL.", "You don't invite yourself over, and you don't abuse your emergency key.\n\nNTA\n\nYour SIL, though, is definitely the AH, and \"crying\" after being told to give an apology?
