Fetching a board game isn't an emergency. Change the locks and take back that key, even if it's just a symbolic gesture. Good luck on the apology, though. I doubt you'll get one.", "NTA.

She cried. Some people assumed it was bratty but I don\u2019t, I think she likely realized she was wrong and it was more serious to you than she realized. As such this could be a deeper issue- whereas a normal person might just apologize and move on, maybe she thinks that it\u2019s weird to apologize now because she didn\u2019t realize she was THAT out of line? Again, she cried. She is at least non-confrontational which is\u2026not consistent with being ok seeing your BIL poop. And is consistent on a social event being urgent.

She took advantage of getting the key to your place for emergencies and used it for her convenience. Getting a \"real apology\" is pointless at this point I'm afraid. She still doesn't realize what's wrong with her behavior or pretending that she doesn't, and her behavior or attitude is unlikely to change even if she offered an apology. Simply change the lock and put healthy distance between yourself and your SIL.", "You don't invite yourself over, and you don't abuse your emergency key.\n\nNTA\n\nYour SIL, though, is definitely the AH, and \"crying\" after being told to give an apology?

She said sorry - why not accept it and move on?\n\nThe whole \u201ckey for emergencies\u201d thing is super vague. You might be thinking - key for when wife and I are in ICU. But many other people give keys to family with far loser use policies. My family lets themselves in to my place all the time. My mother is always surprised when I point out I can\u2019t let myself in as I don\u2019t have a key (I moved away and didn\u2019t grab one when I moved back). \n\nDon\u2019t nuke what sounds like a friendly family relationship over something so trivial. \n\nAlso - just what do you expect from a \u201creal\u201d apology? Flowers? A note on social media apologising for her transgressions? Just move on with your life.", "ESH.

I guess on being seen as a brother and not just her sister\u2019s husband\u2026 the reaction of you and your wife is probably enough to remind her that this isn\u2019t the case in your mind and reestablish more appropriate boundaries. You could chat about it further if you want, but moving on is probably easier and will require less energy than taking up residence in your mind will", "NTA but...  just move on.  To me this seems like an incident worthy of an annoyed snort or eye-roll, and not really requiring some ritual self-abasement ritual.  Yes, SIL pulled a jerk move.  Is this a strong pattern with her, or is it an incident outweighed by general good SIL-ish behavior?", "Surely it works both ways? It is true that fetching a board game is not an emergency. But neither is locking yourself out of the house. Usually what people really mean with keys is \u201cfor times it is convenient to have you do something for me\u201d. \n\nI think the history of past interactions is relevant. Is SIL ever told to let herself in? Is she ever asked to drop things off/pick things up etc. \n\nIf it was just for emergencies you\u2019d get one of those security boxes that paramedics/police can gain access to (usually via a company who holds the code). They are far more likely to need access in an emergency than a family member. \n\nI don\u2019t think she should have just let herself in.

From what I\u2019ve seen, she often does whatever she wants to the people close to her without consequence. I understand from most of the comments that it\u2019s important and I should move on, which I\u2019m willing to do, but what can I do in the future so that boundaries are respected? I agree with others that taking the key away is a start.", "Is changing the locks cheap where you are? I\u2019d expect to pay at least 3-4 weeks grocery bills worth to change my locks. Then a little extra to re-cut all the key copies. \n\nI just don\u2019t see the risk of a family member I otherwise trust (she grabbed a board game - she didn\u2019t hock their TV) copying my key anywhere near equal with the financial cost of changing locks.", "I don\u2019t think it hurt him too bad. Life\u2019s too short to get hung up on the little things", "I switched out a door knob with a lock and new keys and it was like $12", "You can re-key existing locks for reasonable (to me, anyway) charge. If you trust people who violate your boundaries to have access to your home, you do you!", "She crossed a huge boundary. Huge. I wouldn't want my man or myself be put in this situation. The locks get changed today. \n\nShe's lost all her privileges and must always have verbal confirmation that it's okay to come over before she even gets into the car. \n\nYou sir, are entitled to your privacy. Especially, when you are unwell. \n\nAlso, didn't we just go through Covid?! I mean, if someone says \"No, don't come over. I don't feel well.\" Don't you just stay away.

You replied \u201cI\u2019m in the bathroom with the door open\u201d.

She didn\u2019t do anything wrong really", "change the locks", "NTA but given the SIL's actions you and I both know you're not going to get the apology. Don't  bother telling her you want the key back because she'll just go make a copy of it before giving it back. Do have your locks rekeyed, though, because the woman ignores boundaries and you don't know when she will inade your home again or for what reason. Obviously her \"I want\" trumps any boundaries you may have set and her understanding of the word \"No\" is more than a bit off.", "NTA but maybe ask her what she thinks \u201cemergencies\u201d are. But sometimes just saying \u201cwhat you did was wrong so apologize\u201d doesn\u2019t warrant the compliance you think it should.\n\nI\u2019d start by asking what she thinks emergencies are, then once she\u2019s done, state what I think emergencies are, then walk her through her actions and explain why I entrusted a key to my home to her, that if something \u201cemergent\u201d happens, I trusted her judgment to have access to my home *only* when it\u2019s absolutely required. But the access has a stipulation: that it is for something out of the ordinary and \u201cemergent.\u201d Stopping by to grab a game just because it\u2019s convenient for her does not meet the criteria. She cannot be using access to my home to just pop in and out whenever. All other times, permission needs to be granted or an invitation to be there. I don\u2019t know if I would take the key back or not, it would probably depend on how she reacted. Appropriate response = second chance. Belligerent/other response = key given back until faith/trust can be rebuilt.\n\nYou know your sister better than we do, so you\u2019d know if there was any mischievousness in her intentions. I\u2019m assuming that she just let convenience cloud her judgment, so I think reiterating the rules and boundaries would be a good start. We all say we\u2019re adults and \u201cdo better\ud83d\ude44\u201d and it should be obvious, but I think most of us honestly are just a bunch of kids running around in adult meatsacks. She might just need a calm walkthrough of why what she did upset you.\n\nIf she\u2019s just being obtuse but still wants the key, another option you could put on the table is: she can keep a key if she buys you a security camera, that way you can monitor for when she just \u201cpops in\u201d whenever she feels like, that way if she breaks your trust again, you\u2019ll know to get the key back from her, or just straight up change locks. Or just take the key back at the beginning, after all lol\u2026 I dunno, maybe it\u2019s a stupid suggestion but sometimes family is close even though you hate them sometimes. My concern would be her popping by when she knows no one is home. She\u2019s more likely to think about doing that if she knows that a ring camera is recording her every time. Nah, I doubt she\u2019d even take this option as it\u2019s kinda self-degrading, but I\u2019d offer it in the right scenario, just because it would get some points across about just bad her behavior is.\n\nFuck I got high and I\u2019m rambling, my apologies. Good luck with your shit.", "phoebe rocked that line", "Sure, the key thing is a good way to enforce your policy without effort on your part!  I'm sorry to hear that SIL consistently acts that way, that's too bad.  \n\nThe thought I'm having here is that once you know what you can expect from people, the easier it is to live with them.  In SIL's case, she's not mature enough to have extra-key privileges, so just enjoy her company if and as you can, when she's *actually* been invited in.", "A relative who \u201cdoes whatever she wants without consequence\u201d isn\u2019t someone I\u2019d want to have a key to my home.
