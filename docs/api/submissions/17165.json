Fetching a board game isn't an emergency. Change the locks and take back that key, even if it's just a symbolic gesture. Good luck on the apology, though. I doubt you'll get one.", "NTA.

Change locks.", "NTA, don't expect an apology, and don't move on. Just get the key back.", "NTA - but maybe neither is she? She sounds like she might be autistic or at least neurodivergent. She cried. Some people assumed it was bratty but I don\u2019t, I think she likely realized she was wrong and it was more serious to you than she realized. As such this could be a deeper issue- whereas a normal person might just apologize and move on, maybe she thinks that it\u2019s weird to apologize now because she didn\u2019t realize she was THAT out of line? Again, she cried. She is at least non-confrontational which is\u2026not consistent with being ok seeing your BIL poop. And is consistent on a social event being urgent. You asked if you should move on- yes. Because she cried. But you aren\u2019t wrong for wanting an apology.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand the concept of key for emergencies. My family doesn\u2019t get one. People who get keys often feel entitled to use them. \n\nI would take it back. She violated your families boundaries and privacy.", "Nta because she came in when you told her no. And said cool sorry, if she was sorry she wouldn\u2019t have come into your place uninvited. I doubt you\u2019ll get an apology from her. Change your locks", "NTA. She should have respected your boundaries especially as it was non-emergency. She took advantage of getting the key to your place for emergencies and used it for her convenience. Getting a \"real apology\" is pointless at this point I'm afraid. She still doesn't realize what's wrong with her behavior or pretending that she doesn't, and her behavior or attitude is unlikely to change even if she offered an apology. Simply change the lock and put healthy distance between yourself and your SIL.", "You don't invite yourself over, and you don't abuse your emergency key.\n\nNTA\n\nYour SIL, though, is definitely the AH, and \"crying\" after being told to give an apology?

I'd also argue if you're gonna be a jackass and barge into someone's house after they're sick and have asked you not to, at least pick up some ginger ale or chicken noodle soup or something.\n\nI don't think bringing that stuff barging in when someone asked you not to okay in any way, but that's a v standard thing to do to help when someone is sick.", "NTA and you should get that key back since it's in fact not being used for emergencies.", "Just move on man", "You're NTA as you've done nothing wrong but it's not worth holding a grudge over if your point has been made already. Why create unnecessary drama for yourself?", "ESH seriously this is not the hill to die on. It doesn\u2019t sound like she even saw you. She ducked in, grabbed something, and left. She said sorry - why not accept it and move on?\n\nThe whole \u201ckey for emergencies\u201d thing is super vague. You might be thinking - key for when wife and I are in ICU. But many other people give keys to family with far loser use policies. My family lets themselves in to my place all the time. My mother is always surprised when I point out I can\u2019t let myself in as I don\u2019t have a key (I moved away and didn\u2019t grab one when I moved back). \n\nDon\u2019t nuke what sounds like a friendly family relationship over something so trivial. \n\nAlso - just what do you expect from a \u201creal\u201d apology? Flowers? A note on social media apologising for her transgressions? Just move on with your life.", "ESH. No, she should not have barged in without your permission but also she didn\u2019t really hurt you. She grabbed her stuff and left. Just move on man.", "NTA. \n\nA genuine apology will never be forthcoming. Change the locks.

I guess on being seen as a brother and not just her sister\u2019s husband\u2026 the reaction of you and your wife is probably enough to remind her that this isn\u2019t the case in your mind and reestablish more appropriate boundaries. You could chat about it further if you want, but moving on is probably easier and will require less energy than taking up residence in your mind will", "NTA but...  just move on.  To me this seems like an incident worthy of an annoyed snort or eye-roll, and not really requiring some ritual self-abasement ritual.  Yes, SIL pulled a jerk move.  Is this a strong pattern with her, or is it an incident outweighed by general good SIL-ish behavior?", "Surely it works both ways? It is true that fetching a board game is not an emergency. But neither is locking yourself out of the house. Usually what people really mean with keys is \u201cfor times it is convenient to have you do something for me\u201d. \n\nI think the history of past interactions is relevant. Is SIL ever told to let herself in? Is she ever asked to drop things off/pick things up etc. \n\nIf it was just for emergencies you\u2019d get one of those security boxes that paramedics/police can gain access to (usually via a company who holds the code). They are far more likely to need access in an emergency than a family member. \n\nI don\u2019t think she should have just let herself in. But I also don\u2019t think this is a major transgression worth fracturing a friendly relationship for.", "Just move on\n\n\nIs how A H get away with their shit", "Strong pattern for sure. From what I\u2019ve seen, she often does whatever she wants to the people close to her without consequence. I understand from most of the comments that it\u2019s important and I should move on, which I\u2019m willing to do, but what can I do in the future so that boundaries are respected? I agree with others that taking the key away is a start.", "Is changing the locks cheap where you are? I\u2019d expect to pay at least 3-4 weeks grocery bills worth to change my locks. Then a little extra to re-cut all the key copies. \n\nI just don\u2019t see the risk of a family member I otherwise trust (she grabbed a board game - she didn\u2019t hock their TV) copying my key anywhere near equal with the financial cost of changing locks.", "I don\u2019t think it hurt him too bad. Life\u2019s too short to get hung up on the little things", "I switched out a door knob with a lock and new keys and it was like $12", "You can re-key existing locks for reasonable (to me, anyway) charge.
