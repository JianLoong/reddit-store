We come from different backgrounds where his family was comfortable middle class/edging more towards the poverty line with inflation. My family has always struggled. We are immigrants and so I have a very strong work ethic. I\u2019m also an introvert and don\u2019t have many friends. While I was in college I worked two jobs, one was remote which helped a lot because I would do homework while working. I got a job in my field right out of college paying high 5 figures and decided to continue working the remote job I had during college. It brings me an extra $1200 - $1500 a month working 10-25 hours a week and it\u2019s easy to do.\n\nMe and my boyfriend just moved in together. I asked him to sit with me to budget. We have three trips we want to take this year. Two small ones for birthdays and a big one for our anniversary so we needed to figure out what was going on money wise.\n\nThe first thing he asked was how we were splitting bills. I said 50/50 obviously. He said that wasn\u2019t fair because I make a lot more than him. I reminded him that most of that comes from my second job and I didn\u2019t think it was fair to count it because he could also work a second job if he wanted more money. He said it wasn\u2019t fair to only count some of my income and not all when making the budget because he\u2019s putting all his money into our future while I get to keep some of mine for myself. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all. \n\nI don\u2019t make more money because of my career or because I got lucky, I literally work 10-25 extra hours a week to have this money and I save all the money I make from this job. Plus we\u2019re not married, we\u2019re only dating right now and for all I know he could break up with me tomorrow and I would have poured my hard work and money down a well. He thinks if we take x amount out of my full salary then we have to do the same for him because he shouldn\u2019t be punished for \u201cnot being a workaholic.\u201d I told him it\u2019s 50/50 or I break the lease and go back to living alone which I can afford to do very comfortably while still saving for my future and we can revisit this convo if/when we get engaged and plan to start a family.\n\nAm I wrong?

Don't you have the goal of staying for a long time with him or is it a trial ? I mean you are obviously not OK to share everything with him, meaning you don't trust him.

With that said, I agree 50/50 is the way to go, perhaps revisit how to split expenses if you marry.", "NTA. 50/50 is reasonable if you both work full time.", "YTA I hope he gets the fuck out of here, holy cannoli. Bless up.", "NTA. \n\nUnless he had some sort of illness or obligation that prevented him from working as many hours as you, your extra hours should not come into play for any calculation. \n\nThis sounds like it could be an ego problem. Some guys can't handle not earning the most. His problem, not yours. He has the opportunity to earn more, and its his choice not to. He doesn't get to make that choice, then use you to get the rewards anyway. \n\nJust be aware that this is a flag. Not a red one yet, but definitely hints towards one. \n\nWhat happens if in the future, you get an amazing promotion or opportunity and suddenly earn twice what he does. Would he expect you to be fine with him not contributing?\n\nAnd if you get married and decide to share finances, is he going to overspend and leave you with nothing? Sounds like he might be the type of person to feel entitled to \"shared\" money, and not care if you do all the work and get nothing from it. \n\nIf he can't treat you as an equal now, what will happen if/when you have children? Will he expect you to do more than him because you're a woman and that's your job? Or will he throw a tizzy if you suggest that you keep working and he be SAHD? Will he blame you for a reduced income when you can't work? Will he keep spending the same way, and leave nothing for you or the kids?\n\nWhat happens if you get sick or injured? Will he pick up the slack and pay more when you can't? \n\nIf he out earned you, would he really be happy to pay more? (If you're game, you could try that out and cut back on the hours. But that's manipulative and if you get to that point, the relationship likely won't work out anyway.)\n\nThese may sound wild and they might well be, but definitely something you should think about. If you dismiss these concerns, make sure it's because you've talked to him, or you truly know him and have thought about it. Not just the reflexive \"internet stranger doesn't know my life\" (I don't. I could be way off base. But think about it properly before dismissing). \n\nI got caught out by a guy like this. Started small. I earned more, so he expected me to pay for more. I earned about 30% more, so I paid about 30% more of the bills. When I lost my job, he threw a massive tantrum and still tried to spend what little money I had. He spent the $5k I got as a gift from my grandparents on his hobbies, and then managed to con me into getting a 10k loan so he could buy a ridiculous car that broke down within 3 months of purchase. \n\nI just don't want you to fall into this without realising it. I see the possible beginnings of financial abuse in your post, and wish somebody had told me to really consider the colour of the flags he was putting out when it happened to me.

Finances should be discussed first.", "Valid take", "OP isn\u2019t an asshole just because they didn\u2019t discuss this ahead of time. 50/50 is the default, the BF is the asshole for assuming OP would subsidize his lifestyle.", "It became a thing because sometimes the situation is more complicated than it is here. If the partner who works less also does more housework, thus enabling their partner to work those extra hours, their unpaid labor should be taken into account. Or if the partner who makes more doesn\u2019t want to downgrade their lifestyle to what their partner can afford, they may prefer to pay more than 50% to get the nicer apartment. But in this case, it sounds like he is just an opportunist.", "This should only ever be a thing if you're a married couple who is keeping separate finances. And then it's because you're in a committed relationship for sure. \n\nLiving together boyfriend girlfriend is far closer to being roommates.", "I honestly don\u2019t see the contradiction. It\u2019s all work; she\u2019s just hustling for herself. If the employer is satisfied with her productivity and she can get her homework done, more power to her.", "It was a call center job at the time, while I was waiting for calls did you want me to twiddle my thumbs? Or stare into space? I did homework where i could and I still took enough calls and had so many positive customer reviews that I got a promotion. You will not make me feel bad for working smarter and still working hard.", "What do you expect her to do? Twiddle her thumbs in her free time at work? That\u2019s ridiculous. Work smart.", "I laughed at this too.", "This made me cringe too.", "He makes $5k less than my salary from my main job.\nWe\u2019ve only lived together for a week. His lease ended before mine so he stayed with me for two months. He didn\u2019t pay any bills because I pay my rent in advance. While we lived together he did more of the daily stuff like dishes, dinner, light dusting because I was working 12-18 hours. I did more of the deep cleaning on my off day like laundry, bathrooms, vacuuming and just deep cleaning spaces.", "Or revise the budget and not spend so much on them. Op would be the AH if she wanted nice trips but he couldn\u2019t afford it. He shouldn\u2019t have to be forced to work a second job to keep up with her lifestyle choices and I hope she understands that. Hopefully that is not the case though.", "Right. I agree OP is not an asshole but let\u2019s not normalize working more than 40 hours a week as a good thing.", "Ok so it sounds like he is the asshole. You did everything for him to make sure you both have a comfortable life and sounds like he is just upset he isn't the \"bread winner\"\n\nWhen you're married (or whatever long term relationship status you want) then he can talk about pooling your income to raise both your living standards but at this point (I assume it's early if your just moving in together) I would keep things 50/50", "Hmm, maybe he doesn't like the fact that you make more than him? It doesn't sound like your incomes are too different, but that fact you have more is making him almost resource guard what he does make.

Stick to your guns.", "My partner and I split bills extremely unevenly because we moved for my job growth, to a city where he can't get paid as much, I make over 2x his salary. I have a second job instead of him because he has MS. Before, when our incomes were closer together, it was more 50/50, and will be again when we move because our incomes will be closer together. \n\nAlso we're married and have dogs together, so it's pretty committed. \n\nI would never split expenses like this for some dude I just moved in with.", "This is the way. Prior to marriage if both were working a full-time job we put an equal percentage into the bills based on our income. If I made 1000 and she made 800 I'd put 500 and she'd do 400, all cool.

Opposing approaches to money management can utterly destroy a relationship.", "I think it also depends on the disparity of income/spending expectations.  2 people making \u00a330k and 40k can probably split fairly easily, a couple making \u00a319k and \u00a375k is harder if the higher earner wants to maintain a certain standard of living and the lower earner doesn't want to be struggling every month.", "Usually also because it would otherwise be out of budget for one party.", "I honestly don't care - I wasn't trying to make you feel bad. It just sounded funny the way it came out - you went out of your way to basically say you had a strong work ethic and then two sentences later you're talking about doing your homework at work. It was simply funny timing. Really nothing more than that.", "As I said in another comment, it was simply funny timing. \n\nHowever, if you really WANT to get into it, then the answer is that it depends on the job. She said it was a call center job. I work on software that is used in a lot of call centers and I have almost 15 years of working with the management and agent sides of call centers across the entire globe.\n\nSome call centers, particularly huge ones, just have a minimum quota and if you meet that quota, then that's all they care about as long as your CSAT scores are good. The call routing software usually distributes calls evenly based on skill, so you don't get a lot of say into how frequently you get calls. So if you're in one of those, then yeah, you find something to do between calls.\n\nOther call centers distribute calls on agent availability, and agents are supposed to handle their availability status or click a button when they are ready to receive the next call. That way the agents have time to go to the bathroom or grab lunch or take care of lengthy wrap-up, but some agents intentionally don't make themselves available as often as they are supposed to, so they can do something else.\n\nThis can be a problem because the company is literally paying you to take calls and if you're intentionally spacing out your calls to do less work, then you might get great CSAT scores for the calls you DO take but this might mean that the company has to hire another agent to keep up with the call volume.\n\nSome call centers have weighted skill-based distributions so basically you tell your supervisor if you don't have a lot of calls, and they increase the percentage of calls you get. But agents rarely say anything because they figure they're not getting paid per call, so there's no incentive to take more calls.\n\nEvery call center does things a little differently, so without knowing her specific call center policies or job contract, it's hard to say what the company expected her to do. \n\nNo matter what, the company is paying people for their time, so unless you KNOW for certain that the OP's company was okay with her doing homework, don't just assume it is ridiculous. Maybe it was fine, maybe it wasn't. \n\nI was not judging her - I was simply entertained by the timing of her sentences and how they read.", "Ouch", "I think 50-50 sounds like a more than adequate split. I was wondering if it is a situation where you make money from the second job, but he takes care of the house while you are working those extra hours. It's sounds like you split these tasks evenly (or at least, you take a portion of them and he takes another portion). NTA", "Props to you both for agreeing on what to do, building history (and raising dogs!) together, and staying committed through adversity. I hope the future is brighter for both of you  ;-)", "I appreciated the lightness of your joke. Didn\u2019t seem judgy. Made me laugh!", "It wasn\u2019t funny though. Ironic? Yes. Funny? Only if you were being judgmental.", "No, you aren't wrong. You are working more. So, what, he gets to work less and pay less. Not cool. Don't marry a guy that wants to wine and feels entitled.  That is taking advantage if he doesn't want to pay his half. He wouldn't say that to a normal room mate.", "NTA. My husband and I have been together for 29 years, since high school. At first, we shared one bank account and paid for bills out of that account. It caused so much stress because we forced ourselves to keep track of each others spending. We now have separate accounts and a shared one for shared living costs. I make less than he does and I contribute 40 percent of my pay, while he contributes 60 towards the shared account. I do IC or sell things in Marketplace and eBay on the side. He has a consulting business. We don't expect anything from our side jobs to be contributed, but of course wouldn't complain if it did. This works for us. We can save together, and save or spend our money that we have separately, freely. OP you are NTA. You work hard for that EXTRA money. It's not his to lay claim to.", "ESH. Just putting it out there that I\u2019m not picking sides! You absolutely seem work hard for you money, and your side job is a nice for a little extra, but ask yourself, if the roles were reversed, would you be happy with the situation? Say you made less money than him, would you accept paying bills at 50/50? If your answer is yes, then by all means, stick with the 50/50 plan you have now, but if your answer is no, you\u2019d expect to pay less because you make less, then I\u2019d reevaluate my thinking if I were you.", "NTA but you shouldn't be living together. You have to discuss money ahead of time and if you don't agree, it is likely the end of things unless you both compromise. That compromise shouldn't include you working two jobs to subsidize him. If you two were just roommates, he would have to pay 50%. If he can't afford that, he should get a second job like you.", "NTA\n\nFinancial exploitation isn't pretty and sadly, that's what your BF is demanding.  The more you work, the more you get to subsidize him?  The less he works, the less he has to pay for joint and personal expenses?  No way.  \n\nAs for his argument that he shouldn't be punished for not being a workaholic -- well, neither should you!\n\nI suggest that you back slowly toward the door, clutching your credit card before your BF decides it's unfair he can't use it to equalize his spending power.", "YTA if this was the other way round, with the girl earning less, everyone would be saying the guy needs to understand that the girl earns less etc. complete double standards. I do think things should be split based on income, and that it can change. What would happen if he starts earning twice as much as you? Would you still be happy with 50/50? If you have kids and stop working to look after them, would you still want 50/50? No because it wouldn\u2019t be fair. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s not working or contributing, you saying he should get a second job if he wants more money is ridiculous. You are lucky to do your school work during your working time, most jobs wouldn\u2019t allow that", "I'm so confused. Ive seen this scenario posted time and time again and the judgement is split cost equally to what each partner earns. But for some reason because she's a woman and he's a man. He's evil and she's gotta run, red flag. Honestly this subreddit disgusts me. You don't care about equality only getting one over the other. Honestly do yourself a favour.  Quit this sub before it damages your world view. What did I expect from the degenerates of this sub. The top votes for the post are fuck this guy and she ain't his meal ticket. Imagine the downvotes if the roles were reversed. I really hate this argument of switching gender roles but the insane hypocrisy because he dares to ask for equality. We are so lost. You can't even hide your sexism. People can't even build meaningful relationships anymore. Most people have a foot out the door. Just waiting for a \"red flag\" then they sprint.  This isn't a redflag. You're just selfish and looking out for yourself. Don't be in a relationship don't live with him. Just be selfish. It'll totally help your introverted nature. They'll love you", "I came here leaning more the other way, but I have to say if his salary is in line with that of your full-time job, NTA. I think you have exactly the right idea about this.\n\n1. If he wanted to make extra income he could also get a second job\n\n2. You\u2019re not married, so there is no protection for you if you pour more equity into this relationship than he does\n\n50/50 is what makes the most sense for your situation, and in my opinion he can take it or leave it. I\u2019m right there with you \u2014 I\u2019d also go back to living alone as opposed to being extorted by someone who is supposed to be my partner. Why should you sacrifice all of your hard work that you could be saving for your future (and his as well if he\u2019s a part of it) so that he can coast by a little easier now and prepare better for his future (that you may not end up being a part of). If it were really about saving for your joint future, then he shouldn\u2019t have any problems with you saving your money for that in your own account while you split bills equally. After all, if he fully intended to be a part of that future, you\u2019re inevitably going to spend that money on your joint goals anyway, right?", "NTA.   Why is he expecting you to pay his expenses?  You aren\u2019t even married.", "NTA but can I ask what the extra job is? Cause I'm looking for a similar grind", "NTA. Hes looking for an almost free ride. You arent married, you don't have children.

Don't be taken for a fool.", "I wouldn't say he's asking her to \"subsidize his laziness\" if he's working a full time job. That's not lazy. OP is just going above and beyond with how much she works. Which is obviously totally fine! If she's happy with it, then that's great.\n\nI would absolutely call him greedy and entitled though! He has no claim to the money she works extra for.", "I think OP is NTA but I do agree with you that it's shocking that they moved in together without discussing finances. That being said, I don't know where the BF gets off thinking it would be anything other than 50/50", "These are not bills that necessarily need to talked about beforehand. In her other comments, she has said that they split all things 50/50 be it chores, rent, utilities, eultc.  So, she would not be wrong in assuming that their trips expense would be the same way too.

For a relatively small income disparity between unmarried couples, it should be 50/50 or close to it. For a large income disparity, the higher earner either needs to bring their standard of living down to what the lower earner can afford or foot more of the bill.

I have worked at a few call centers when I was younger. Tech support at Apple didn't even care about what I was doing as long as I wasn't surfing the internet.

I don't think \"only\" working a full time job is lazy.\n\nThat being said, I don't think he should feel entitled to the money OP earns for working a second job. Seems a bit greedy to me."]}
