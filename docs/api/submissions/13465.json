These past few days, we haven\u2019t been talking because we got into a bit of an argument about something that happened at my 24th birthday party. So my extended family came down from MA to my party, and I had my whole family there. \nAlice has a tattoo of the rapper Eminem on her leg. It is offensive. It\u2019s from one of his pictures flipping somebody off. Me, my friends, and my family do not like him. He is disgusting, offensive, and problematic. And our friends were shocked she got him tattooed. We thought it was immature and crazy. I guess she has like 25 tattoos, so it\u2019s not as bad as if it were her only one. We all knew she liked him a lot and she always said \u201cHe saved me during my childhood\u201d Whatever that means. \n\nAnyways, Alice dressed appropriate at my party. Which I was shocked because usually she wears outfits with 100 colors and patterns everywhere. She wore a beautiful dress, but it showed the tattoo. I was shocked. I thought she would at least have the decency to cover it up at a family function. My aunt and cousins were staring at it and later asked me why I\u2019d be friends with somebody like that. \n\nI told her afterwards how impolite that was, and she just said \u201cWell, you know how I am. And who I am. You didn\u2019t tell me to cover it\u201d I feel like it should have been implied. Anyways reddit, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1680087971, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125kl9w/aita_for_expecting_my_friend_to_cover_up_her/", "score": 497, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you had a certain dresscode including covering up her tattoo, you had the chance to voice your concerns before hand and  ask her in an appropriate way. You didnt take that chance, but called her out for not forseeing your wish. YTA.", "YTA. It wasn't \"implied\" anywhere to cover up a tattoo. It sounds like she changed her normal way of dressing just for your party to begin with. Your family are also TA btw with their \"how could you be friends with someone like that\" pearl clutching. \n\nHer tattoo is part of her. She probably doesn't think of it every day or notice it every day anymore than I do mine.", "YTA.\n\nShe can wear whatever she want, she is expressing herself and if you don't like it don't be friends with her.\n\nThe tattoo also clearly hasa meaning to her and judging her for your own likes and dislikes is just a dick move. Maybe don't be friends with her anymore, she should find good friends that will accept her the way she is without judgment.", "YTA no doubt. How judgy you and your family are.", "Yta, it seems like you don't really like your friend anyway. You've put down her opinions and what she normally looks like a couple times in this post. So obviously you don't share a lot of opinions with her so why would you think she would just read your mind and share this one. Also unless she was showing up naked or there was some big thing she'd ruin pictures for like your wedding or something, and even then it'd be a stretch,  I don't think you have the right to dictate what she wears.", "YTA, you don't seem like you like her that much. You both may be better off not being friends...", "YTA as much as your family her body her choice  grow the F up and FYI he saved me during childhood too it means without his music to listen to I would have committed suicide", "YTA\n\nIf you thought your family might get upset over the tattoo, it's your responsibility to inform your friend about that before the party.  Even then, is up to her if she wants to cover it up. There's no implications here whatsoever.  You're a fool if you think that is implied.  \n\nI have conservative family.  I am heavily tattooed.  IDGAF if someone doesn't like my tattoos, but if a friend was concerned, I'd cover up for her, but only if she asked me to.  You didn't ask your friend though, so you can't really get upset at her here.", "YTA. You and your family are judgemental and opinionated.", "YTA.  As you stated, she dressed appropriately for the party, and still, you are finding fault with how she dressed. That shows that she cared enough about you that she toned down her usual style for your party.\n\nYou never explicitly asked her to cover up Eminem's tattoo. Rather than acknowledge that she has a point,  you're spinning this into a narrative that she should have understood the implicit request that she do so.  Implied requests are not requests.", "Info : Did you ask her to cover it up around your family previously or was she supposed to infer that you\u2019d prefer she not show the tattoo off?", "YTA for being a fake friend to someone you clearly dislike and don't respect", "YTA.\n\nYour aunt and cousins are also AH for that judgmental attitude. It is very clear that you don't like Eminem and you mention that friends and family don't either. You are also dismissive of your friend saying that \"He saved me during my childhood\" That means that your friend was probably struggling with her mental health and she found some moral support through Eminem's music, lyrics, etc. You clearly show that you have low interest in the life of someone who you say is one of your best friends. The whole attitude comes off as extremely shallow.\n\nIt seems to me that you've taken your dislike of a rapper and are using that as a stick to beat your friend. How dare she like something that doesn't meet with your approval? \n\nYour friend surprised you by dressing appropriately. When your family complain, showing their small-mindedness, you don't say that you defended her. She made an effort, yet you still complain. Unfortunately, your friend is not a mind reader.\n\nJust noticed that you were \"shocked\" when she got the tattoo, when you saw the dress and also when you saw the tattoo. I'm getting a lot of overly dramatic vibes here.\n\nPeople like different things. In life, you're going to have to accept this.

I\u2019m trying to figure out why Alice would want to be your friend and spend time with you? You clearly don\u2019t like her and constantly judge her for choices she is making to her own body.

You dismiss her feelings regarding being saved (probably from dark times) as that\u2019s what THAT ALWAYS MEANS. -.- do her a favor and stop being her friend.

Disgusting behavior. /: I hope no one ever treats you that way.", "Not that I'm a fan, but there has been a weird amount of Eminem hate in this sub, lately, lol. \n\nAnyways, she can wear whatever she wants. You don't own her, you don't get to make decisions for her. If people are up in arms because she has a tattoo of one of the most popular rappers *ever*, then you all really need to grow the hell up.

It sounds like you don't really like her. Maybe don't refer to her as your \"friend\".", "With friends like you, Alice needs no enemies.\n\nYou\u2019re coming across as super judgemental.

You are not some imperial princess and she\u2019s one of your serfs.", "YTA, I hope Alice finds better friends.", "YTA you sound like a very bitchy and judgemental person. It's a tattoo for god's sake, besides why are you acting like she got a super hyper offensive tattoo when it's just Eminem? Your \"friend\" needs a better friend than you.", "YTA. I hope she reads your post and sees all the support she gets from a community of strangers. She deserves better than you.", "YTA - it's just a tattoo.\n\nI would understand this reaction if Eminem was a sex offender, a nazi or a scientologist or something, but to my knowledge, he's none of those things.", "I think this probably will come as a shock to you but YTA. The way you are talking about Alice leaves not one impression that she's even, *puts on glasses*, one of your bestfriends. She seems like you only have her as a friend to boost your own ego up and get upset that she just isn't able to be manipulated that way. \n\nLet me also give you some more shocking news OP... people can't read minds! If you wanted her to cover up her tattoos then you should've said so and then probably she wouldn't have come at all to save you and your toxic family the anxiety.", "YTA. Can\u2019t believe you wasted time posing this.", "YTA. Sounds like you resent her and borderline don\u2019t even like her? Alice needs some new friends fr.", "YTA. Can't believe I wasted time reading this. Not your body or tattoo, so never mention it again. You and your family is rude to complain about something like that and on her clothes", "The most offensive thing at that party is OP.", "YTA. Never expect people to magically figure out something you\u2019ve never told them. From her reaction it sounds like she would have covered it if you told her beforehand but you didn\u2019t say anything until it was too late.", "yta. dude if your family is offened by a tattoo of Eminem yall need thicker fucing skin. rap god", "YTA and Alice needs a new friend group, I would defend my friends until the end in front of my family if they didn\u2019t like something about their appearance. \nYou have different lifes, and the fact that anything she does bothers you so much (fun clothes, tattoos etc) - you just simply do not care about her.", "YTA and I\u2019m shocked your friend is even willing to continue the friendship with you.

You sound like you are constantly offended by your friend by simply existing and expressing herself the way she wants to. I hope Alice finds people who truly appreciate her because you definitely are not.", "YTA - what did you respond when your family disrespected her by asking how you could be friends with \u201csomeone like that\u201d.  What does that even mean?  They are making judgments solely based on a tattoo and you did fuck all to defend/support your supposed best friend.  With friends like you, who need enemies.", "YTA.

Really your friend? So Alice has tattoos and one is of someone famous flipping the bird. So what.

If you thought it would have offended your family at the party, you should have taken care of it while inviting her instead of finding fault after the party. Even your friend knew that you knew she was like that and you didn't mention anything to her. That there is all that needs to be said.", "YTA. You say 'whatever that means' about him saving her childhood. Eminem has many songs about being abused, drugged up as a kid, loneliness, addiction and being estranged - there are MANY reasons why his music has helped her and many others through their childhood. \n\nIt's her body and your family should be grown enough to stick to their own.", "YTA. You don't get to dictate what others put on their body, and don't be surprised if Alice (and other friends) cease to contact you.", "YTA....you don't get to police other people's bodies.  You could have asked her....and she could have told you NO. Get over it, go find something else to be judgy about.", "YTA, the way your talk about her, it\u2019s hard to imagine y\u2019all are that close. \u201cAt least have the decency\u201d girl be so for real. You\u2019re the one with the issue, if you wanted it covered you should have said something.", "YTA. It seems like your friend would\u2019ve been nice enough to cover the tattoo if you asked, which is more than I would\u2019ve done. To just expect her to do it without prompting is absurd. Also, a true friend would\u2019ve stuck up for her when your family started asking questions. You don\u2019t need to like the tattoo, but from how you describe Alice it seems like you barely like *her*. Why are you even friends?", "YTA\n\nYour opinions of a rapper don't dictate what your friend wears or shows. You sound downright insulting, really. You were \"shocked\" she dressed \"appropriately\"? Your family sounds judgemental AF. I would be seriously rethinking my friendship with you if I were her.", "YTA.\n\nMan, do her a favor and drop contact. She doesn't need someone as fake as you for a friend.", "YTA. Holy shit, you have got to be the most entitled AH I\u2019ve seen on reddit so far. I hope your friend ditches you and your toxic family.", "It won't be shocking to know that you'll shocked to know that\n\nYTA\n\nLike she has a tattoo and it can be whatever as it's not on you or your family.

You're 24, use your words.\n\nAlso\n\n>she always said \u201cHe saved me during my childhood\u201d Whatever that means.\n\nThis seems to me that she might have been suicidial and listening to his songs was the only joy she could find and what helped her stay alive.

You clearly don't respect her. At this point, I'm not sure why Alice remains friends with you - she deserves more.", "YTA.

I'm guessing you've grown up in a conservative cult that finds rap music the word of Satan.\n\nNot sure how you and Alice became friends without understanding that \"Eminem saved me\" is code for \"unalive herself if not for finding solace in his music\". \n\nYou have two choices moving forward- growing up and learning to be a better friend or sticking your head in the sand along with your conservative family and finding your way back to the 1950's.", "I mean yeah YTA if she wanted the tattoo she thought it was appropriate. I don't even see where you asked her. If you don't like her, so meeting friends with her. But people don't exist to be accessories to you.", "YTA. If you wanted it covered, you should have asked.

These past few days, we haven\u2019t been talking because we got into a bit of an argument about something that happened at my 24th birthday party. So my extended family came down from MA to my party, and I had my whole family there. \nAlice has a tattoo of the rapper Eminem on her leg. It is offensive. It\u2019s from one of his pictures flipping somebody off. Me, my friends, and my family do not like him. He is disgusting, offensive, and problematic. And our friends were shocked she got him tattooed. We thought it was immature and crazy. I guess she has like 25 tattoos, so it\u2019s not as bad as if it were her only one. We all knew she liked him a lot and she always said \u201cHe saved me during my childhood\u201d Whatever that means. \n\nAnyways, Alice dressed appropriate at my party. Which I was shocked because usually she wears outfits with 100 colors and patterns everywhere. She wore a beautiful dress, but it showed the tattoo. I was shocked. I thought she would at least have the decency to cover it up at a family function. My aunt and cousins were staring at it and later asked me why I\u2019d be friends with somebody like that. \n\nI told her afterwards how impolite that was, and she just said \u201cWell, you know how I am. And who I am. You didn\u2019t tell me to cover it\u201d I feel like it should have been implied. Anyways reddit, am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What age range is appropriate to show tattoos?", "Definitely just you.", "If she found the tattoo as problematic for public consumption as you do, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten it in the first place. The fact that she got it shows that she values her own opinion and self over the opinions of others. Why would she assume she has to cover a tattoo to hide it from others, when she got it in a visible place on her body?", "God, you and your family are so needlessly nasty. There is truly something wrong with all of you, and it\u2019s a wonder that any of you have any friends.", "Not at all and that's a dumb expectation to have", "You really can\u2019t expect someone to read your mind. If you want someone to do something, then speak up. Otherwise, you don\u2019t get the right to be offended.", "\u201cHow can you be friends with someone like that\u201d. Your family asked, not even knowing her.  I see where you get it.  You\u2019re all judgmental ah\u2019s.   She would be better off without you honestly if this is how you feel about her.", "Yes, it's just you wanting your best friend to hide an important part of her personality because you can't stand by her or stand by your friendship when it comes to your judgemental family.", "Look, you\u2019re on the young side and obviously your family has had a big influence on the way you see the world. \n\nBut you\u2019re 24 now, you\u2019ve had 6 whole years of adulthood and by now you should have poked your head outside of your family bubble to see some other perspectives.\n\nYou describe Alice as one of your best friends, but the way you\u2019ve posted about her it genuinely sounds like you can\u2019t stand her at all. You might want to examine your feelings here, this is not how friends behave. \n\nYou are absolutely the asshole here, and I feel like you already know that based on how aggressively you\u2019ve gone at your friend, twisting her tattoo into something she has somehow done to you.", "You sound like a very tiring \u2018friend\u2019.", "In case you didn't get the memo, it's just you.", "Seriously?  Absolutely just you.  I have no tattoos and I will get no tattoos but I still can't imagine someone just assuming they need to cover up their tattoos for a rather mundane event.  You can't expect everyone around you to magically know about the prudish beliefs of you and your family and bend to them.  If a middle finger offends you so much how do you get through everyday life?", "It\u2019s just you. Cause you are a judgemental person who doesn\u2019t care about anyone but herself it seems.", "If I have to see my uncles dead ex-wife\u2019s naked portrait on his arm every family function you can deal with Eminem flipping someone off. YTA", "Yes it\u2019s just you.\n\nI have family members of different generations and it\u2019s never been an issue.", "Your \"common\" sense is not so common nor does it make sense.", "Yup just you and the rest of you judgmental family. You are seriously the problem and TA.", "I generally just choose to not look at things that may upset me. And when they happen to cross my field of vision I don\u2019t care because that\u2019s what normal adults do. That\u2019s what normal adults teach their children to do.", "Yes, exactly. It's just you and YTA. How can you be so young and so narrow-minded at the same time?", "No. Use your words. People aren't mind readers. \n\nYTA", "I think there might be like 1 person in my entire family who would care, but she'd react that way about any tattoo", "Will nobody think of the children!!!!", "Just you and your narrow mind", "I feel like it's common sense to like your best friend, but maybe that's just me", "Definitely just you. I have tattoos of animals that some older members of my family don't like. Guess what? It's my body and they can learn to live with it for the like 4 hours we see each other. \n\nAlso, for someone claiming to be Alice's best friend, your other comment is crazy judgmental and it's obvious you are happy to judge without knowing anything about Eminem or the things he has done. Alice deserves a way better best friend than you.", "No it's really not common sense. Because most people grasp the idea of not my body not my decision, and either admire the tattoos or ignore them. That's what normal people do. They don't demand that other people cover up their tattoos to prevent from offending them. They either decide to stop spending time around the person, or they work on it themselves and get over their issues. You do not get to force your body choices on someone else. Get over it or end the friendship. But it sounds like she might be well on her way to doing that herself, so you won't have to worry.", "That is not common sense. Most my older relatives  are also tattooed up. More so than younger ones. They are also Trump loving Christian Conservatives.", "Just you, I\u2019m sure.", "NTA. You're not asking to cover just any tattoo, but one of Enimem flipping someone off. Now I personally couldn't be bothered to give a rat's ass about Eminembit some people do, apparently.", "Sure sounds like it with the Eminem tattoo and 'he saved my life'.\n\nThe striking thing about both posts is the startling lack of and shred of empathy or actual caring.\n\nIn the post you linked to, there isn't one little bit of \"how can I help my friend who seems to be depressed?\"  It's all \"why doesn't this person listen to me and act like me and she's such a jerk for not doing that.\"\n\nOP seems to have a touch of r/IAmTheMainCharacter syndrome.", "OP must really hate her friend if she is posting about her in multiple subs.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/123m951/aitb_for_calling_my_friends_behavior_cringy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nI'm not sure if OP is consistently trying to figure out how to not be considered TA? Trying to justify how they have been treating their \"friend,\" as OP calls her.", "I'm shocked, SHOCKED I tell you! \\*clutches pearls\\*", "I know right! Something of this reaction would only be acceptable if it were something like that.", "yes haha I hate them (obviously) lmao", "I'll go with you. I'll make sure my outfit clashes heavily with yours.", "Or my pin-up girl, complete with side boob, straddling a locomotive engine.", "I really don't think they do. OP managed to insult everything from appearance to a probable mental health problem in less than 500 words. That's impressive even by awful people standards", "And??? The tattoo, and what Alice does with her body or what she wears is none of OPs business.", "... ... ... yeah, still not seeing the problem.", "[deleted]", "It should be fairly obvious that vulgar tattoos should be covered up when around certain crowds, and when OP talked to friend about it she offered up nothing but a \u201cwell you know who I am\u201d response \u2014 I\u2019ve been around enough people to know that responses like that means she does not give af about what is or isn\u2019t appropriate and delights in these types of reactions.\n\nIs OP judgey? Yeah. She should\u2019ve spoken to friend beforehand, and if friend took offense to it they could\u2019ve decided not to come. Or they could\u2019ve said no and OP could uninvite her. This, EVERYONE sucks here imo. This all could\u2019ve been handled differently. You can make your own judgment though it\u2019s not that deep lol", "At least imo it was a fair implication since it was a family event and the tattoo is explicit. I stand by my judgement and I respect that you disagree with it.", "I still think it's a fair assumption since it's an explicit tattoo and it's a family event. Again though I respect your opinion and I think it's a fair one.", "Nah, it's about the tattoo.\n\nReplace the person she had with another more obviously problematic 'artist' and everyone would be saying yta. People just don't want to address or acknowledge the fact that Marshal Mathers is trash.", "I was just coming here to point all of this out.  He's so homophobic he worked with Elton John.  It's like she heard of song of his and that is who he is.  His lyrics aren't him, an dof she'd done a simple Google search she'd have figured that out.", "He actually raised his brother, his niece and the daughter of the guy Kim cheated on him with too. It's pretty obvious that OP knows nothing about him.", "He also literally played himself but gay in The Interview?? Reeeealll homophobic \ud83d\ude44", "Dude bought Elton John a cock ring - Elton himself has said that Eminem isn't homophobic.", "\"im not homophobic i have one gay friend\" is not the defense this thread thinks it is.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just about admiring him. She said he saved her life. Sometimes music speaks to us in a way that makes us feel understood and not so alone. I have certain songs I love for similar reasons that have lyrics most people would find horrific.", "*Beautiful* has really helped me through some hard times.  And honestly maybe that song is what her so called BFF needs to listen to again.  \"They can all get fucked just stay true to you\" \n\nYTA OP.  Patterns and colors, oh the horror /s", "Exactly!", "OP is the AH for sure but \u201cNot everything they say is homophobic\u201d isn\u2019t the defence you seem to think it is.", "This is brilliant", "I just got two new ones and I\u2019m in that phase where every time I catch them in the mirror I\u2019m like, :D \n\n  I can\u2019t forget about them though, because they\u2019re itching like craaaazzzyyyy", "I have one on my ribs that is mostly very close to my skin tone and I can only see it in the mirror if I'm standing at a certain angle and I literally forget it's there all the time.", "Do you have a link for the other one?", "I think this is my new kink: when the OP paints themselves in their best possible light and still comes off looking like a giant, flaming asshole.", "These are solid inquiries!", "But here\u2019s the thing: she didn\u2019t *ask* Alice to cover the tattoo. Had she asked, things might be different.\n\nInstead she is behaving as if Alice broke some rule that we all know and abide by except Alice. Which is absurd.", "Agreed. For me I am assuming (hoping) that it\u2019s more about the middle finger than it being Eminem.", "Yeah, just the lack of any attempt at empathy and all the comments being weirdly focused on Eminem, of all things, made me think that this had to be the same person. Garbage friend. And yes, full-on, narcissistic, main character syndrome.", "I saw that.  She needs to just leave this \u201cfriend\u201d alone.  She doesn\u2019t care about whatever trauma or depression she went through and just doesn\u2019t like her.", "It's a date then.", "And there were children around why should children see that", "Yeah, I don\u2019t either", "Meh, I have kids (older now, but I also have an infant grandson) and wouldn't have thought twice if someone had a tattoo like that around them. I'm not a pearl clutcher though (or American). TBH, I don't find the middle finger that offensive these days, in most contexts. OP's friend may not have even thought about it.", "Well without actually having a photo of the tattoo we don't know if it's vulgar or not (personally I don't think flicking someone off is vulgar). What I do find pretty offensive is when people are judgemental about their supposed grounds choices for their own body.\n\nIt sounds like this needs to be a friendship breakup. The friend deserves better.", "The tattoo is going to be seen by \"certain crowds\" everyday. There will always be someone who finds it offensive, and those who won't blink an eye.", "It wasn't a family event though it was her adult friends birrhday party. Idk about you but I don't go to my friends birthdays expecting a family reunion anymore. I don't think ive once invited my family to any party ive thrown myself. It's not really a fair implication unless OP told Alice the whole plan and vibe for the party.", "My lord. Explicit? Giving the middle finger is played for laughs in many movies, including PG movies. The idea that it\u2019s wildly inappropriate to have it showing at a 24-year old\u2019s birthday party (where the family came \u201cto party\u201d) would never have crossed my mind. \n\nIf OP is so scandalized by her friend\u2019s tattoo (and usual attire, apparently) maybe she should not pretend to be friends with her anymore. Friends that are not-so-secretly judging everything you do suck.", "Even in 8 mile, there's an entire friendship ark with a Gay man, and he defends him in a rap battle. I mean, the OP knows nothing about anything, but seems to act like they have it all figured out. Those people are the worst. OP is definitely YTA, for so many obvious reasons.", "Not just worked with him. They\u2019re close friends and if I recall, Elton helped him with his addiction issues.", "He's so homophobic he called himself gay in the film \"The Interview\" as in my opinion a tasteful joke. As an LGBT person, it was hilarious.", "His wedding present to Elton John made me spit my water out. Elton John gushed about it in an interview and the way he told the story to Graham Norton was so funny.", "To add, Eminem is so homophobic that he gave Elton John and his partner jewel encrusted cockrings.", "He didn't just work with Elton John. They're friends. Elton helped him with becoming sober. Em sent EJ and his husband cock rings as a wedding present.", "As someone who doesn't really know Eminem. What is the proof that he's homophobic? It's the first time I hear people speak badly of him like that tbh.", "It's been such a long time since I listened to it, I got goosebumps all over listening to it again!\n\nAgreed, she really needs to listen to it again and realize that OP is not her friend at all. No one deserves a friend that's ashamed not only of you, but your body. Eminem showing middle finger is hardly offensive as a tattoo.\n\nI can only go by OPs name that they're from the USA, and I know middle finger is considered more offensive there (at least from my and friends experiences), but where I'm from and the countries I've lived in... Middle finger is just considered a joke really and barely offensive.", "<sigh> I remember those days.\n\nI really should get another one. I've always fancied a little bat clinging to my ankle...", "I have very noticeable tattoos and I'll straight up forget", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/125kwxg/aitb_for_wanting_my_friend_to_cover_up_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1", "Oh 100%", "Lolololol I have children.

Such a good message.  I got goosebumpy at \"or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own\"", "Same lmao.
