I would have left too.", "NTA\n\nThere are some things that should be done in private. Having a loud argument is one of them.", "This argument may have topically been about sushi but it doesn't sound like it was emotionally. It sounds like your girlfriend was at her wits end and that was just the straw that broke the camels back with this guys treatment of her. \nI'd say she was holding a lot of hurt and anger and it came out in a really stupid petty way, because it sort of burst the dam. Inappropriate place and behaviour for the place but I think it's about more than just the one situation.\nNTA you, the restaurant staff and patrons shouldn't have to deal with whatever is going on between them", "What he say lol? NTA in like 99% of realities but if he was like hey after i leave im gonna burn down an orphanage i mean i guess i see it", "NTA but upon learning about what this argument was over, I am STUNNED you didn\u2019t just get up and walk out. Fuck. That.", "Yeah we can\u2019t choose if we don\u2019t know exactly what happened.  \n\nThat said, most of the time when people get into public arguments that result in a business asking people to leave, I\u2019m gonna go NTA", "NTA. What is it with people and airing out their dirty laundry in public for everyone to hear? Simply annoying and they deserved to get kicked out.", "Lol, arguments in restaurants - that would be mortifying.  I've noticed that younger people here in the US act with much less shame than they did, say 30 years ago.  In fact, every aspect of their lives and every feeling needs to be on display and even forced on other people these days.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the flow and say YTA. \n\nYou let some AH gaslight your gf about her own opinion. She doesn\u2019t like sushi. She\u2019s allowed to dislike anything she wants and he made her feel crazy\u2026purposely. Then you called her trashy, while trying to verbally beat this guy at his own game?

How embarassing. NTA. She needs to learn how to control herself in public. She's fully grown and should know how to behave herself properly by now.", "NTA\n\n\"She\u2019s mad at me because I said I couldn\u2019t support that kind of behavior and found it immature and frankly a little bit trashy even though I was on her side\"\n\nLet's see... oh well.", "Why do people think they have to support another\u2019s bad behavior just because they are in a relationship? She disrupted others dining experience because she felt the need to be right, to the point you were basically asked to leave the restaurant. Does she not realize that others dining out might be celebrating something special or saved up to go out for a night or just wanted to relax over dinner and she disturbed them because she felt the need to throw a tantrum? And, yes, I think it was trashy and poor manners. NTA, but it would be a red flag in the relationship for me.", "We definitely need more context over what they were telling about.", "That\u2019s my sentiment. She was unrepentant and said she was right, I said she didn\u2019t need to raise her voice and get in a screaming match in public. I asked her why it mattered so much", "She said she doesn\u2019t like sushi but she ate it because she was hungry. He said he\u2019s a lawyer and since she ate it that means she must have liked it.", "I hope that doesn't apply to medical emergencies or seeing someone getting ready to drive through a wall into the restaurant via Mazda. But otherwise, definitely agree.", "Agreed, and I made the dude look like an idiot multiple times over the course of the dinner over inane arguments", "I said she can eat what she wants, who cares if she likes it or not, she\u2019s hungry. I said to her she should stop engaging the dude because he\u2019s just trying to rankle her chains. She said no I have to prove a point and kept arguing. I said she should just say she can eat what she wants and ignore whatever he says after and she kept going down the rabbit hole of arguing.", "The fact that she is justifying her horrible behavior would make me not want to see her. She not mature enough to admit she could have handled it better", "That's 2 red flags right there. The first is the fight in a restaurant. The second is her defending it. It would be an instant dealbreaker for me.", "Oh, FFS.\n\nAnd here I was holding out hope that this was a topic worth getting into heated debate over.", "Holy childish Batman. NTA.", "WTAF? How does anyone manage to get into a screaming fest over this nonsense?", "You were right. Dumb shit. She should've just gave him a \"Bless your heart.\" and ignored him.", "NTA\n\nMost sushi places offer something else like tempura, why didn't she just get something else?\n\nIt was an infantile argument to get in a screaming match over.\n\nEdit for fat-finger syndrome.", "I feel like, at that point, just tell him that the dinner isn't going to work out and just leave? If you have to repeatedly do that..just leave, sushi isn't worth it to have to put up with that shit. Like, it sounds like he spent an entire day antagonising people and starting shit. Tell him you're not going to put up with it and just leave jfc", "Why didn\u2019t you leave?\n\nEdit: you also said beat him at his own game? \n\nI don\u2019t know it you are the AH, that guy sure is and I don\u2019t think you supported your partner well here. Calling her trashy was too far. She needed your support. I suppose I could say ESH. But I\u2019d be reconsidering our partnership.", "I agree.", "Lol, you often overestimate people, don't you?", "Yeah, like she wanted it cooked", "Indeed, here I was thinking GF must've had *some* legitimate basis to see red, but nope.", "Idk, people making themselves look like idiots can be pretty funny. Idk why anyone would take anything the dude said so serious that it caused a screaming match. Literally just laugh at him and he'll leave on his own eventually.", "I didn\u2019t say anything negative to her until we were by ourselves. Frankly, yelling in public is trashy. \n\nI called the guy out and suggested to my GF she ignore him. She didn\u2019t. I kept telling her to just chill it\u2019s. It an argument worth having the dude was dumb and just trying to role her up."]}
