If you ever wish to gift your sister anything that's your prerogative, but absolutely 100% not your responsibility, omg and to then *guilt* you for being better off than them??   Forget that, NTA and I'm proud of you lol\n\nedit bc they are asking for *20,000 dollars?!?!?*  out their damn minds\n\n**out their damn minds I say**", "First of all, NTA. Your parents are not entitled to spend your money simply because they think you have more than you need. \n\nSecond of all, I used to work at a pretty well-known ballet school which did summer programs like this. Just because she's good at her local school does not mean she's good in the bigger picture, unfortunately. If she's really good, she'll likely get a nice scholarship offer (depends on the school but that's absolutely standard) and if she didn't, she's either good enough to attend but no one thinks she'll be a star, or she missed the cutoff for scholarship applications (or she's not a tiny slip of a thing, but that's a whole other issue). \n\nMoreover, ballet is extremely expensive to pursue and pays peanuts. Lots, I daresay most, professional ballerinas are being subsidized by their parents, and this is after the pricey tuition for pre-professional programs, pointe shoes, costumes, YAGP competitions, etc. Unless your sister is a phenom - in which case she'd be rolling in scholarship offers - there is little to no chance she goes on to have a career if your parents can't afford one summer program. \n\nThis is to say, if anyone tries to tell you that you're ruining her chance at a professional ballet career by refusing to pay - I assure you that you are not.", "NTA. Can I ask how much they need to send her to the thing?", "$20,000 on a hobby? Lol nope. Your parents can pick up extra jobs, take out a loan, or simply drop the issue. Such programs are a want, not a need. It\u2019s not going to wreck her life if she doesn\u2019t attend. \n\nNTA", "OP I'm gonna recommend that you edit your post to include the fact that your parents are asking you for up to $20k for this special summer ballet program... That kind of context matters, especially for respondents who are saying that even though it's your money, you're only hurting your sister, not your parents. Because that's *insane*. Maybe there are scholarships available for your sister, 'cause _damn_.\n\nHard NTA\n\n>They said I was being an asshole because when I was young they couldn't afford to pay for the stuff I was interested in. I pointed out that they are old and they still can't afford shit. \n\nSorry not sorry that the truth hurts. \n\nYou don't make more money than you \"need\"--you make more money than you spend. Which is, in fact, the only way to get ahead. Save your money.", "$20,000 is an awful lot of money for a summer program and ballet opportunities won\u2019t ever come cheaply.  Many times these kind of programs have a few places for really talented students to receive a scholarship to participate.  That\u2019s how your sister needs to get into them.  I would hesitate to provide the money for this, partly because your parents will expect you to continue to provide the money for your sister to advance in this world and it will likely outstrip your earning ability.  Welding is a good paying trade, but your earning power is not unlimited.\n\nEdited to add NTA.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe them anything.  It\u2019s good they remember you when they need something from you. I hate how people act like people owe their parents/family something cause you were born into that family by chance. You don\u2019t owe them anything and they have no right to tell you you earn more money than what you need. Also it\u2019s so manipulative for them to say you should give your sister money cause she looks up to you.  WTF?", "NTA..No way are you in the wrong and I love the response too! You earned it, with what seems no help from them. How many kids in your situation grow up fucked because of parents like that. And now they want a hand out for getting lucky you didn\u2019t?

The only exception being if they are the guardian due to unforeseen circumstances.", "This is a waste of money. Ballet is brutal if she even gets a job with it. It's not a particularly useful extra curricular for college apps. Spend your money elsewhere. NTA.", "Definitely NTA, that money could go toward a mortgage, retirement, any number of things. You earned it, it's yours to use how you want.", "NTA. \n\nSaw elsewhere they are asking for help funding a 20K program. That's insane and absolutely an unreasonable ask from them. \n\n>they will have to go into debt for her to go on this program.\n\nI mean, it's just a ballet program. This isn't a life or death situation. Why are they even considering that level of debt?\n\n*Anyway*, reading your post, it seems there's a bit of underlying resentment for your chaotic and unstable childhood vs your sister's more stable and nurtured childhood. Perhaps investing in a little therapy for yourself might be helpful for your own quality of life and mental health?
