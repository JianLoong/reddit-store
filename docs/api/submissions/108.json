They broke your stuff, and it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re offering to pay for it. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI can promise that if my stuff was being broken by roommates I\u2019d be pissed off too. Doesn\u2019t matter how expensive or how cheap. It\u2019s my stuff, it was in perfect condition/working order before they got their grubby mitts on it.\n\nYou\u2019re not being unreasonable. Don\u2019t let them use your stuff anymore.", "This is an appropriate reaction. NTA at all", "What part of your reaction do they see as \u201cover exaggerating?\u201d  If it is the importance of your stuff not being important, they shouldn\u2019t mind doing without use of your things.  Do the shared possessions of other roommates get broken?\n\nHave a sense that one person may be doing this.", "I can bet you that if you broke their stuff, they would be just as upset. NTA", "NTA\n\nTheir reaction shows they don't care. You can't make them. Put your stuff in your room now.", "NTA\n\nYou are not overreacting. But I can understand why they would think so. From their perspective you are screaming over a paper towel holder instead of calmly informing them that because they do not respect your stuff, they can't use it. A paper towel holder doesn't seem worth screaming about unless it is very expensive or sentimental. But that's not what you're *actually* screaming about. You're screaming because they have repeatedly broken or misused your things, and this is the last straw. If they say you are overreacting again, make sure to tell them that it was no just about the paper towel holder, it was your built up frustration from them continually not respecting and/or breaking your items. Not to mention this is the second time something of yours has broken and no one told you.", "NTA also have the tism I would move out", "ESH, them for disrespecting your stuff, you for screaming about it. It\u2019s not on to scream at people. If they are not using it properly then you should keep things in your own room.", "ESH\n\nIt sucks that they don\u2019t respect your stuff and they absolutely should use things with care and clean cooking items after use, but this is also kind of to be expected when you live with roommates. Things get used and broken\u2026 sucks. You have a right to be upset but you have a conversation with your roommates about it, not flip out and yell at them. Lock things in your room if they can\u2019t be trusted to use things properly.", "See! If they had just been straight up front, I guarantee I wouldn't be as mad because I get it, shit happens. What pisses me off is them not telling me that they broke something, and I go to use it and find it myself.", "I've thoroughly inspected everything and can't figure it out.\n\nThe thing that most sucks is, that chair was kind of a status symbol for me, after having nothing for so long, I bought that chair and practically slept in it I loved it so much. The first nice thing that I worked hard for and bought myself.", "They're in the common areas, but everyone agreed to respect my items upon moving in because I am autistic, I am very territorial over my items normally, and I explained this to everyone, with them being okay and accepting it, so I opened some trust doors, and well, yeah.", "Does it matter? It doesn\u2019t give people the right to use and break things.", "Is it okay if people use, not clean items and ruin things if it\u2019s in the common area?", "Yeah, if it had just been the paper towel holder and the occasional mess in the convection oven then I imagine your reaction would've been less so. But a normal recliner is expensive enough that I'd have the same reaction, let alone one like what you've got. And to me, not coming clean right away makes whoever broke it seem way more guilty and suspicious", "Maybe find the manufacturer and ask about repair options.", "I'm so sorry.", "Or the store OP bought it from, if they're local. If its a furniature store, they'll likely offer repair services. They may even be able to repair it under warranty.", "Even if it's not under warranty, some chains will still do repairs at a reasonable price. It happened to my power sofa last year."]}
