She probably took that as an insult. I think that you should try to encourage her for the hard work that she has done instead of notifying her that she isn\u2019t gifted. That\u2019s a good way to make her self esteem plummet, and that can be irreversible at someone her age.\n\nBest course of action would be to sit her down, apologize, tell her that she is gifted, and then mention or express that humility is the backbone of success. Subtly, so that she doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re lying about her being gifted.\n\nKids aren\u2019t usually as logical, so cater to their emotions.", "Gifted means you have been giften a talent. You didn't do anything for what you achieve.\nYou say your daughter used her intelligence, worked hard and now can go to the university at a young age. Gifted people don't need to put effort to achieve anything. People who work hard and are successful can be proud of theirselfs. So if you say to your daughter she is not gifted you value her engagement, her hard work. For being gifted you can thank good, for your own hard work you can thank yourself.

My son is doing a BA and has not yet picked his major and my daughter will be studying physics and computer science. My son is also very smart and is a history and language nerd.\n\nMy daughter is smart and hardworking and is attending at an earlier age than usual. She was in a school program for gifted kids. We were having a conversation at dinner the other day and my wife mentioned how proud she was of our daughter and how lucky we were to have gifted children going to good university programs and how not many people can do what our daughter did.\n\nI was also very happy but I said that while (daughter) is really hardworking and smart, I would not say that she is actually gifted and others can't do it if they put in the same amount of work. \n\nHer school does a lot to try to admit girls into her program, and my wife helped teach her advanced college level math and physics from an earlier age, she didn't naturally pick it up on her own. If anything being a younger applicant with the same credentials probably helped her stand out more for the admissions committee.\n\nI have seen how people can ruin their lives over thinking they are 'gifted' and it going to their head so I just wanted to caution her about that. \n\nBoth my wife and daughter are upset at me now, my wife thinks I was trying to put her down which is not true and says she is gifted, while my daughter actually agrees with me but says I should not have said it as she already knows.\n\nAITA here? It might not come across in the post but I am genuinely proud and happy for my kids and beyond what I described here, there was a lot of complimenting and celebration on my part.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
