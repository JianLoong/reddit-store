You didn't do anything for what you achieve.\nYou say your daughter used her intelligence, worked hard and now can go to the university at a young age. Gifted people don't need to put effort to achieve anything. People who work hard and are successful can be proud of theirselfs.

We were having a conversation at dinner the other day and my wife mentioned how proud she was of our daughter and how lucky we were to have gifted children going to good university programs and how not many people can do what our daughter did.\n\nI was also very happy but I said that while (daughter) is really hardworking and smart, I would not say that she is actually gifted and others can't do it if they put in the same amount of work. \n\nHer school does a lot to try to admit girls into her program, and my wife helped teach her advanced college level math and physics from an earlier age, she didn't naturally pick it up on her own. If anything being a younger applicant with the same credentials probably helped her stand out more for the admissions committee.\n\nI have seen how people can ruin their lives over thinking they are 'gifted' and it going to their head so I just wanted to caution her about that. \n\nBoth my wife and daughter are upset at me now, my wife thinks I was trying to put her down which is not true and says she is gifted, while my daughter actually agrees with me but says I should not have said it as she already knows.\n\nAITA here? It might not come across in the post but I am genuinely proud and happy for my kids and beyond what I described here, there was a lot of complimenting and celebration on my part.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She just has more talent - more of a gift - for using her mind this way.\n\nIt's all a spectrum of course... but conflating 'gifted' with 'not having to work hard' is precisely *why* so many gifted young people hit a wall when they reach the limits of natural talent and have to actually start working for it.

Domains include any structured area of activity with its own symbol system (e.g., mathematics, music, language) and/or set of sensorimotor skills (e.g., painting, dance, sports).\u201d\u00a0\n\nEven if you're not from the US it is still a good baseline for defining a gifted kid.

That doesn't mean it just comes out of nowhere without having to work and learn things first. You can be smart af and never accomplish anything. Putting the work in is still necessary to success and not mutually exclusive to her being gifted. It's not one or the other, you dingus. \n\nLook if you said something like you are more proud of her work ethic than how gifted she is bc smarts she was born with, but she chooses to work hard to pursue her interests and excel and that is admirable...

University admission rate isn\u2019t even high for 18yo and your daughter being able to take university classes put her way ahead of the general population, so you\u2019re simply statically wrong in your assessment that she\u2019s \u201conly hardworking and smart\u201d. \n\nA lot of gifted children actually struggle with mental health and have life long effects on their self esteem and integration into society. Your notion of \u201cpeople ruining their lives overthinking they\u2019re gifted\u201d isn\u2019t entirely accurate. People who think their smarter than everyone else may have problem with an inflated ego but children who are gifted (in my experience) don\u2019t actually go about thinking they\u2019re better than others (which I think is demonstrated in your daughter\u2019s response to your statement). In fact, a lot of gifted people get pushed out from society after academia because of said mental health issues. Most are \u201cunderachieved\u201d aka having \u201caverage jobs\u201d (not \u201csmart\u201d professions) or struggle to hold down a job because they\u2019ve been conditioned as a child that their giftedness aren\u2019t embraced that they should be ashamed of it and hide it, and as an adult they continue to not live up to their potential because their intelligence can\u2019t be conventionally monetized through capitalistic means. \n\nSource: my brother is gifted and got admitted to university as a full time student when he was 14. \n\nPlease be grateful that your daughter has access to gifted programs and maybe she will struggle less than other gifted people who did not have the resources to succeed.

Stop comparing your children either subconsciously or consciously, that\u2019s only going to drive a wedge between them and they either will hate each other, and go NC/LC with you when they grow up.

Being able to learn algebra at 10 is well within the gifted range.\n\nYTA and honestly, you would have to put major effort into being a bigger asshole.  People like you are the reason those programs have to exist.  It's revolting that you would speak to and about your *obviously gifted* child like this just because of her gender.  And yes, it's *obvious* that her gender is the only reason you put her down like this - because otherwise you would have said *neither* of your children is gifted, rather than just picking on her.

I think we need to reevaluate how we identify gifted students because those with grit, determination and abilities outside of STEM should be rewarded as much as those born with a STEM inclined brain with opportunities to excel.

Having a natural affinity for a subject does not mean that you have to reinvent the entire subject by yourself without any input from outside.

Working hard is entirely independent of being gifted.  *Some* people who aren't very bright achieve well by working hard and *some* gifted people fail because they never learned to do the work because they were never challenged.  It is possible to be both gifted *and* hardworking, just like it is possible to be both lazy and not very bright.\n\nYes, she worked hard to achieve what she has - but it's unlikely that she would have achieved what she has at her age if she wasn't gifted.
