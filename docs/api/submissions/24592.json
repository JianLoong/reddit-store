You didn't do anything for what you achieve.\nYou say your daughter used her intelligence, worked hard and now can go to the university at a young age. Gifted people don't need to put effort to achieve anything. People who work hard and are successful can be proud of theirselfs.

We were having a conversation at dinner the other day and my wife mentioned how proud she was of our daughter and how lucky we were to have gifted children going to good university programs and how not many people can do what our daughter did.\n\nI was also very happy but I said that while (daughter) is really hardworking and smart, I would not say that she is actually gifted and others can't do it if they put in the same amount of work. \n\nHer school does a lot to try to admit girls into her program, and my wife helped teach her advanced college level math and physics from an earlier age, she didn't naturally pick it up on her own. If anything being a younger applicant with the same credentials probably helped her stand out more for the admissions committee.\n\nI have seen how people can ruin their lives over thinking they are 'gifted' and it going to their head so I just wanted to caution her about that. \n\nBoth my wife and daughter are upset at me now, my wife thinks I was trying to put her down which is not true and says she is gifted, while my daughter actually agrees with me but says I should not have said it as she already knows.\n\nAITA here? It might not come across in the post but I am genuinely proud and happy for my kids and beyond what I described here, there was a lot of complimenting and celebration on my part.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Domains include any structured area of activity with its own symbol system (e.g., mathematics, music, language) and/or set of sensorimotor skills (e.g., painting, dance, sports).\u201d\u00a0\n\nEven if you're not from the US it is still a good baseline for defining a gifted kid.

She clearly excelled there. If she wasn't actually gifted she wouldn't have thrived academically. She is headed to university at 15 yo, my dude.

That doesn't mean it just comes out of nowhere without having to work and learn things first. You can be smart af and never accomplish anything. Putting the work in is still necessary to success and not mutually exclusive to her being gifted. It's not one or the other, you dingus. \n\nLook if you said something like you are more proud of her work ethic than how gifted she is bc smarts she was born with, but she chooses to work hard to pursue her interests and excel and that is admirable...

I'd want to make sure my children understand that people aren't born more or less than each other, and that if they were in anyone elses shoes, they would do exactly as they do.", "OP had to make a point of it that the program tries to admit more girls\u2026definitely sounds like OP is a sexist jerk.", "Can concur with the IQ test. Sibling and I went to a gifted elementary school and we took an IQ test upon entry.", "Yup. She\u2019s about to start college, where everyone will be older than she is, she\u2019s about to be judged half to death by other people questioning whether she really deserves to be there. The last thing she needs right now is less confidence!\n\nSo sad that she was so quick to agree w/ her dad that she\u2019s really not gifted. Pretty sure she\u2019s well aware of how he feels about her!", "I just feel so bad for his daughter. I am pretty sure no matter what she does he will tell her it\u2019s nothing special and then claim he is \u201dso proud even if it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u201d", "Probably Isaac Newton inventing calculus.", "\ud83e\udd47", "Great point!!", "Please look up the definition of \u201cgifted.\u201d Gifted people absolutely need to put effort in to become accomplished at something. As another commenter mentioned, you don\u2019t pick up an instrument and magically start playing it. That\u2019s not how the human brain works. Even the outliers.", "I realized this when I read \u201cher school does a lot to try and admit girls to her program\u201d. OP probably believes his daughter is on the program because of positive discrimination", "Then why didn\u2019t your son go at that age? YTA", "And you have heard of those because they are so very rare as to be newsworthy!\n\nI appreciate that for reasons best known to yourself that you want to destroy your daughter\u2019s self-esteem  and confidence so why not just be honest about it?", "I think only Sir Isaac Newton picked up calculus and physics on his own.", "Yep. He also thinks that being told you're gifted goes to your head and messes you up. Nope, it's the perfectionism and anxiety that runs rampant in the gifted population that can lead to issues. Or the bullying in school. Or they glide through school easily until they hit a wall (usually University, but it can come earlier) and suddenly things don't come as easy and now you have to work at it, but they never learned how, so now they're lost without any help. All of these are what gifted ed programs are there to try to help with (f the people saying gifted can get along just fine without spec ed, and trying to drop those programs to save money). It sounds like OP doesn't really understand what being gifted means, or what the gifted program does. It sounds like his daughter has learned well from the gifted program, and won't likely run into any future issues, which is a good thing. But without his wife's help or her gifted program, it could have been a different story, even if OP's daughter was never told she was gifted.", "I got asked why I didn't get 100.\n\nYeah, that shit stays with you.", "Literally my father was just like this growing up. He constantly said my brother picked up on math faster than I did. Well he was wrong, I'm far better at math. I was far more high achieving than either my father or brother. He's been intimidated by me for nearly my entire life. Men with fragile egos need to go to therapy before they have daughters.", "It's okay fr the son to be gifted because he's in a completely different field than OP", "I agree with this. Titles like gifted aren't actually that helpful or necessarily accurate because none of it operates in a vaccum. I don't think he needed to say what he did and certainly not at the juncture he said it but I can see what he was trying to say.", "Yes I understand that too. I knew some \"gifted\" people in uni. The end of the first year was hard for them because the grades didn't come naturally. \n\nUnfortunatly, OP doesn't have any communication skills", "Not true at all. This myth needs to die now.", "You and she may be incorrect. How can you say she isn't gifted? If the concepts and learning come easier for her (easier not innate), then she may judge those that don't catch on as quickly as lazy. There are levels in gifted classes. Those that never had to study or work at it tend to be the ones that fall behind when they have to study at some point; they sometimrs fail in the real world because they are not used to working for success. All gifted students need to put in the work at some point, but teaching your daughter that anyone can meet the same accomplishments with the same effort as her will probably just make her impatient with her future peers.", "YTA and you should be ashamed of yourself putting your daughter down so much that her self confidence has crumbled. She can\u2019t even take pride in the result of her own hard work, and now she\u2019s dismissing her own effort and accomplishment. You are unrepentantly terrible and I hope she finds a healthy father figure to replace you ASAP.", "Okay, so you just use the word 'gifted' to basically mean 'genius'. That's a very different thing though. Your daughter was in a program for gifted kids, and managed to get in university early. Yes of course it's because she got help with advanced classes, but she *managed* it as she was taught. How many kids do you think can actually handle that at an earlier age? I struggled with physics even with private classes when I was 18 already, and I was always considered an above average student! SO many kids try and try and try their very best and don't even manage what your daughter has achieved at a regular pace, let alone years early.\n\nYour daughter is gifted. She is WELL above average. You can acknowledge that without constantly putting pressure on her about it and inflating her ego. (But honestly she already sounds very smart and mature about the issue from her response.)", "The son wasn\u2019t the one being discussed at the time though. I like to think it it\u2019s more likely that this guy is a dad who put his foot in his mouth than a secret raging sexist.", "Are you autistic or something? Normal people don't say things like this to people they love. Did you never say to your wife that she's beautiful because she's not in top 1% and not a supermodel?", "YTA I hope you feel awful. Your daughter is so intelligent she accepts her father ripping her to shreds with humility. \n\nYou gained nothing by saying that. You helped nothing by saying that. \n\nTake some time alone and examine whatever issue (probably with women) that motivated you to say such a horrific thing.", "You\u2019re confusing the terms gifted and genius. By definition your daughter is gifted, asshole.", "How do you know? Do you do the IQ testing etc? And I get the feeling if it was your son getting all the praise for going to college early you would be the puffed out chest proud dad instead of the \u2018I\u2019m just making sure she doesn\u2019t ruin her life\u2019 dad \n\nYour daughter sounds like she is smart and down to earth and deserves a father who is proud and puffs his chest out like dad\u2019s do for their son\u2019s all the time.. she is 15 going to college be bloody proud and show her off\u2026 show your daughter she can do anything with her hard work not that she is \u2018lucky\u2019 because she worked hard", "As a fellow woman in science, THIS - men are so easily seen as (inherently somehow) brilliant; women as hard workers. It\u2019s sexism and everywhere in academia", "You can feel the misogynistic attitude creeping from his post can't you!", "Right? Like dude, I worked really hard at physics and chemistry. Shit, my mother WAS a chemist, and my father was a mechanical engineer, and I STILL couldn't quite master either one, despite both of them tutoring me. Even with someone teaching you, you still have to have the mind for it. OP is a raging sexist asshole.", "What a sexist take.", "Some parents are just plain determined to be their child\u2019s first and biggest bully. Some parents aspire to be the voiceover that bullies their child inside their own head when they are sad or scared or struggling with self-doubt. It\u2019s almost interesting to see how one of them looks from inside his own head - it\u2019s like there\u2019s no emotional connection at all, no comprehension that his daughter is a person. No insight. It must be horrible being him and having to live inside his own mind, but nowhere near as rough as being his family.", "EXACTLY, OP is the one that made her feel this way in the first place but he has the freaking audacity to use that as justification for his behaviour, I'm glad everyone sees right through his misogynistic ass", "He knows that penispeople are best", "Point taken, and yes, I was just pointing out the stereotype and disagree with it as far as softer, harder, but the traditionally male/female part is a fact that we as a society still need to work on getting sorted.", "I think you missed their point. They acknowledge the cultural bias against these areas of study and are questioning whether that played a role in the dad's sentiment. Someone acknowledging that certain things are culturally gendered doesn't mean they support the gendering of things.", "Yes, it is- I don't like it or agree with it, but it's the way a distressingly large portion of the population still think, and I am positing that it's possible op has these underlying prejudices and is overcompensating for the son by putting the daughter \"in her place.\"", "Yup- this reeks of \u2018girls are taking up spaces they didn\u2019t really earn\u2019", "\u201cMy kid isn\u2019t special and I know it\u2019s true because she tells me all the time she isn\u2019t special :)\u201d just burns me right up.", "Disagreed: completely helpful and furthermore correct. \nHistory + language is waaaaay easier an accessible than STEM... especially physics. You absolutely *need* to be somehow gifted to survive university. No chance that an average Joe would be able to complete university in physics. History and language on the other hand would be possible. \n\nIf you think otherwise, you are just delusional. And it helps the discussion if OPs daughter is gifted. She certainly is, starting university that young. In physics.", "And the daughter told him that she knows she isn\u2019t gifted. Poor kid is giving her everything while still absorbing her asshole dad\u2019s opinion that she isn\u2019t worthy."]}
