It's understandable to express your displeasure over being unfriended without cause. You had no role in their conflict and deserved an explanation. If your intention was to make things right and hold them accountable, then your actions seem justified.", "Yikes!!! His wife is sending up all sorts of red flags here. Taking his phone and unfriending people on his social media?! She\u2019s at best overbearing and manipulative, at worst abusive and trying to isolate him from his support system. You are NTA for calling her out on that behavior because quite frankly the way she\u2019s acting is horrible.", "NTA, super concerning and controlling behavior tbh, idk what her intention was to isolate your friend or what but that\u2019s a major red flag", "Husband has an Uncle about 8 years older.

In fact, I had met Raymond while he and Nicolas came to my house with some home repairs.", "Okay, I\u2019m not sure if that is grounds for being stripped of citizenship. But it is an invasion of privacy even if she is his wife.", "Oh, no, no, no, this is very abusive behavior. Please make sure to let Raymond know that you guys are there for him and that you are concerned about how his wife is treating him.", "Whhhhaaaaattttttt?", "ok this just went from his wife is out of her tree, to I think we need a intervention.", "Holy fucking shit, he needs to get away from that psycho", "Tell him to change his passwords everywhere and get his wife some therapy or meds cause she has a screw loose.

She has no right to invade his privacy and delete HIS friends.\n\nAnd I\u2019d be really concerned about Raymond since you mentioned \u201cRaymond does not have a phone because it was confiscated by his wife who gave him a burner phone with just her number in it\u201d. That\u2019s insane of the wife to do and abusive behaviour.\n\nI highly suggest you talk to Raymond about this and show you will be there to support him. Maybe he doesn\u2019t know this is abusive behaviour? Or if he does, maybe he\u2019s just concerned about his wife not being able to afford anything if he leaves? \n\nBut I really hope Raymond gets out of that horrid relationship and gets custody of their daughter. Good luck", "Late twenties. They have an 8 year old daughter.", "Well, he's being abused for sure.", "Rent a box for him or a locker where he can go out of the house and get a burner phone if necessary. Give him your and cousin a number to put in the burner and an external battery he can keep there at full load just in case.", "His wife also told us that me and my cousin were a \u201cbad influence\u201d towards their daughter. Since when? We haven\u2019t done anything\u2026.", "Raymond told me that they\u2019re just going through hard times and that things will get better. Raymond\u2019s wife is a stay at home mom, while Raymond works as an independent contractor with my cousin. Raymond has cited that if he leaves her, she will not anything to eat nor a place because he pays the rent, utilities and food\u2026etc. and he feels his hands are tied.", "She is.", "Yeahhh, I\u2019d still be gone and I\u2019d seek full custody of the kid. Maybe my views are skewed because I\u2019ve lived through abuse and have a zero tolerance policy for controlling behaviors now but making sure my toxic spouse has a place to live and food on the table after I left them wouldn\u2019t even be on my list of priorities.", "She's abusive Imo", "To be fair, I\u2019ve always been aware Raymond had a young daughter but I\u2019ve never met her. So how was I considered a bad influence to her?", "I mean I guess he doesn\u2019t wanna be seen as the guy who left his stay at home wife given she has no income of her own. Let me ask you this, what is she gonna eat off of if he leaves her?", "Not you ,his wife is the bad influence.", "INFO \n\nMissing reasons.  \n\nWhat is the absolutely nothing you are doing?  Drugs?", "Why are you interfering in your \"friends\" marriage?\n\nI'm not sure what is going on between them but I am positive your interference doesn't help Raymond at all. By your own admission you don't really know anything about what was happening in that house that lead to this incident. What if they were fighting because your good buddy ray had been caught using Facebook to cheat? You have no idea what was going on or if the incident had mitigating circumstances. \n\nIf you were concerned for Ray you could have contacted him and let him know you were there if he wanted to chat. Now you have the permanent eminimity of his wife and if you think your friendship can possibly last in those circumstances you are dreaming.", "Well, according to my cousin, his wife was looking at his dms and deleting the chats not only that, as I mentioned earlier unfriending everyone he was dm\u2019ing, with me and my cousin being on that list. When I initially asked my cousin what had happened he told me they had gotten into a massive argument that led to this happening, even so I don\u2019t see the reason why she would unfriend the people he was dm\u2019ing, as they had nothing to do with it. I haven\u2019t really talked much to Raymond and he\u2019s asked me to be discrete about contacting him because of his wife.", "His reasoning for staying with her: \u201cwomen will be women\u201d and if he left her she would have no food to eat.", "If there isn't \"missing reasons\" then he is in an abusive relationship.", "Other than the occasional going out to bars for a few drinks on weekends as friends, we don\u2019t do anything too crazy.", "Yo man, I ain\u2019t interfering with anybody\u2019s marriage, but when she went into his account to unfriend me and my cousin, I was taken a bit back and wanted to know what was going on.", "What happened between them had NOTHING to do with us.", "Cheating is shitty but it doesn\u2019t excuse abusive behavior. They couldn\u2019t have contacted Ray because his wife took his phone and replaced it with a burner that only has her number in it.", "\u201cHad gone\u201d or \u201cwent\u201d - not \u201chad went\u201d.", "Gosh that\u2019s bonkers. I really hope Raymond and his daughter are safe at the end of all this", "Ok then you need to get him help.  His wife is abusive.", "Get him another burner phone will all your numbers in it and help him work out where to hide it.", "He's in an abusive relationship. Who confiscates someone else's phone?? Help him see the truth and leave her. NTA", "Not a good enough reason to put up with abuse", "The wife is abusive."]}
