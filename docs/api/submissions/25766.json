It's understandable to express your displeasure over being unfriended without cause. You had no role in their conflict and deserved an explanation. If your intention was to make things right and hold them accountable, then your actions seem justified.", "Yikes!!! His wife is sending up all sorts of red flags here. Taking his phone and unfriending people on his social media?! She\u2019s at best overbearing and manipulative, at worst abusive and trying to isolate him from his support system. You are NTA for calling her out on that behavior because quite frankly the way she\u2019s acting is horrible.", "NTA, super concerning and controlling behavior tbh, idk what her intention was to isolate your friend or what but that\u2019s a major red flag", "Husband has an Uncle about 8 years older.  His new wife deleted me and any other female not related by blood because insecure much?   \nThen promptly sent me  a friend request for her.  Which was deleted.   I Can't be bothered with that stuff.", "NTA. She is very controlling and trying to isolate him. Make sure Raymond knows you are there for him when he ready to leave her, he will need all of your support.
