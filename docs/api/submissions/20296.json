Once money is in their account, they are able to spend it on whatever they want.", "NTA. They see you as a fail safe.", "Perhaps they need a payee so bills get paid first.", "Hmmm...so \"yikes\" is an insult but \"nazi\" isn't? At the risk of insulting you, it's grammar.", "NTA. Their choices their consequences.", "I am a social worker that works with the homeless population in a major urban city. I strongly urge you to help them avoid homelessness because that creates a lot of other problems that can spiral out of control...homeless shelters and living on the street is terrible. Help them out with conditions. Since they have benefits, tell them you (or there are professionals who do this) want to be the fiduciary for the parent that gets VA $ and rep-payee for the parent that gets disability. This means that their money will be entrusted to you and that you will pay their bills and they can have what is left over. This is the only way to stabilize their housing. If they are not agreeable, you can file on their behalf with a medical provider and do it anyway. Not being able to manage finances related to maintaining housing is a reason.", "It looks like the issue is that they spend the money on crap instead of paying the landlord. The rent could be auto paid for the same day as the disability check hits the bank account. The only reasonable way the OP should think of helping is by becoming POA for their finances. Cut off access to the whole check and put them on allowance with the money left after bills are paid.", "Sure, on social media. Since when did people get so self-important? I'm sure since you are such a civilized gentleman, you would recognize when someone has broken decorum first. I bid you a good day you absolute Muppet.", "NTA.", "Hell, they won't be sleeping in the streets anyway. They'll be sleeping in the nice nearly free car from OP.", "Yikes is to criticism what a used wad of gum stuck to a mangy dog's ass is to a fine dining experience."]}
