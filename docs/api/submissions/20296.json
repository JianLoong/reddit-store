A line has to be drawn somewhere. Let them sell their dolls or whatever. The only other alternative I see is giving them the 600$ (i say give, because you know you wont ever get them back) and then telling them \"this is the last time\" and cutting them out of your life. That way your conscious is clear, and the next time they get into financial shit, they cant pull the symphaty card.", "NTA; first eviction maybe, but *four*?! There\u2019s been ample time to work out an affordable budget, seek financial advice and adult better. They\u2019ve made no commitment to repay those they owe. Their spending behaviour hasn\u2019t changed. \n\nTime to receive a tough life lesson unfortunately. Maybe it will prevent the next eviction.", "Absolutely NTA.  They are adults and they need to accept the consequences of their reckless behavior.", "NTA. There is only one way to help them. All their benefits / income would come directly to you. You would be their guardian and would pay their bills, pay their debts, support the damn cat etc. They would not be able to spend a dime. You would be their parent FOREVER. This is the only way. Is that what you want?", "NTA. Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind. All this time, they sent distress calls and you or others were always there to help and pick up the slack. Enough is enough. Just make sure they don\u2019t end up living with you.", "No your NTA. It's hard to see this happen but you also have to think about yourself, especiallyif you are struggling. Admittedly I wish I'd been less selfish when I could have for my mum but that is my situation. I helped heaps because it was always the two of us and I was happy to do it. \n\nBut I don't reckon you're TAH.", "NTA there are churches that will help with one time payments like this. Tell them to call the church", "NTA, if you keep bailing them out they\u2019ll never change their fiscal habits.", "No.. not even a little bit. Be sure that they don't expect to stay with you if they do get evicted.. \n\nNtA", "NTA.\nThe fastest why to learn financial responsibility is to not have any money", "NTA at all.\nYour not their parent\u2026.", "NTA - sometimes people need to live the consequences of their actions to finally understand why their behavior is / was wrong.\n\nIt sucks but this sounds very much like being cruel to be kind", "NTA ---- No you're not letting your disabled mother live on the streets, your disabled mother is doing this to herself by not managing her money and living within her means.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like you've reached a point where you feel a boundary needs to be put up.", "NtA. You helped enough. It\u2019s a cycle of abuse. Don\u2019t be part of it anymore. They literally have money from the govt without working. They choose to spend it elsewhere. Love yourself more. Limit your contact if necessary", "NTA. They\u2019re adults. On top of that they\u2019re your parents. Normally they\u2019d be on a stable financial position to support the child. They\u2019ve never even been looking to do that. Trying to use your emotions and guilt trip you is disgusting. What did they make a child for, so he could pay for the bills? What a load of bs.", "NTA. Once they stop being bailed out they will get a true understanding of the consequences of their poor financial management. If you want to help then, ensure they see a budget adviser", "Info : If they are both financially illiterate, who is managing their money for them ?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I believe the VA has programs to help individuals in these situations.", "They need to be put into conservatorship. If not you? Then \u2026 maybe the court can appoint somebody? I don\u2019t know how these things work, but somebody out there does. \n\nBecause they obviously cannot handle their own affairs. NTA", "NTA. It sounds like they need to hit rock bottom in order to start to actually live within their financial means. You have helped them before and it\u2019s clear that they keep expecting others to subsidise their financial mistakes.", "NTA, they don't have the money due to their negligence, they are going to be evicted soon since they are behind and not working and spending what they do get on incidentials. What good does it do for you to help them when they are just going to be in the same situation next month.", "NTA. My inlaws ended up broke with no place to live with nothing but their social security. We bought them a house but with stipulations. All credit cards were canceled, they can't get new ones, I have access to their bank, I pay their bills (all electronic, so not a big deal) and tell them how much they have left for the month. We had to teach people in their 80s how to budget. It is hard. I want to scream sometimes. We are constantly the bad guys because they can't spend like they are used to. Not a road I recommend. Just say no, you're tapped out.", "NTA\n\nIf you're not obviously wealthy, tell them something like *\"You wrecked jy credit when I co-signed for your car and you never bothered paying it off so now I can't afford to help you\"* and leave it at that\n\nI know it's not ideal to lie to people but in this case it seems like the much easier/smarter option than trying to reason with them or letting yourself be guilted, plus there's a tiny chance they might come to understand the consequences of their actions", "Whelp.  I guess they better sell the rest of their fentanyl because you have no obligation to help them.  Hold your ground.\n\n\\-NTA", "Nope he has already done way too much. It's just a vicious circle."]}
