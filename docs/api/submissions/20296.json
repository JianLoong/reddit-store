A line has to be drawn somewhere. Let them sell their dolls or whatever. The only other alternative I see is giving them the 600$ (i say give, because you know you wont ever get them back) and then telling them \"this is the last time\" and cutting them out of your life. That way your conscious is clear, and the next time they get into financial shit, they cant pull the symphaty card.", "NTA; first eviction maybe, but *four*?! There\u2019s been ample time to work out an affordable budget, seek financial advice and adult better. They\u2019ve made no commitment to repay those they owe. Their spending behaviour hasn\u2019t changed. \n\nTime to receive a tough life lesson unfortunately. Maybe it will prevent the next eviction.", "Absolutely NTA.  They are adults and they need to accept the consequences of their reckless behavior.", "NTA. There is only one way to help them. All their benefits / income would come directly to you. You would be their guardian and would pay their bills, pay their debts, support the damn cat etc. They would not be able to spend a dime. You would be their parent FOREVER. This is the only way. Is that what you want?", "NTA. Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind. All this time, they sent distress calls and you or others were always there to help and pick up the slack. Enough is enough. Just make sure they don\u2019t end up living with you.", "No your NTA. It's hard to see this happen but you also have to think about yourself, especiallyif you are struggling. Admittedly I wish I'd been less selfish when I could have for my mum but that is my situation. I helped heaps because it was always the two of us and I was happy to do it. \n\nBut I don't reckon you're TAH.", "NTA there are churches that will help with one time payments like this. Tell them to call the church", "NTA, if you keep bailing them out they\u2019ll never change their fiscal habits.", "No.. not even a little bit. Be sure that they don't expect to stay with you if they do get evicted.. \n\nNtA", "NTA.\nThe fastest why to learn financial responsibility is to not have any money", "NTA at all.\nYour not their parent\u2026.", "NTA - sometimes people need to live the consequences of their actions to finally understand why their behavior is / was wrong.\n\nIt sucks but this sounds very much like being cruel to be kind", "NTA ---- No you're not letting your disabled mother live on the streets, your disabled mother is doing this to herself by not managing her money and living within her means.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like you've reached a point where you feel a boundary needs to be put up.", "NtA. You helped enough. It\u2019s a cycle of abuse. Don\u2019t be part of it anymore. They literally have money from the govt without working. They choose to spend it elsewhere. Love yourself more. Limit your contact if necessary", "NTA. They\u2019re adults. On top of that they\u2019re your parents. Normally they\u2019d be on a stable financial position to support the child. They\u2019ve never even been looking to do that. Trying to use your emotions and guilt trip you is disgusting. What did they make a child for, so he could pay for the bills? What a load of bs.", "NTA. Once they stop being bailed out they will get a true understanding of the consequences of their poor financial management.

I believe the VA has programs to help individuals in these situations.", "They need to be put into conservatorship. If not you? Then \u2026 maybe the court can appoint somebody? I don\u2019t know how these things work, but somebody out there does. \n\nBecause they obviously cannot handle their own affairs. NTA", "NTA. It sounds like they need to hit rock bottom in order to start to actually live within their financial means. You have helped them before and it\u2019s clear that they keep expecting others to subsidise their financial mistakes.", "NTA, they don't have the money due to their negligence, they are going to be evicted soon since they are behind and not working and spending what they do get on incidentials. What good does it do for you to help them when they are just going to be in the same situation next month.", "NTA. My inlaws ended up broke with no place to live with nothing but their social security. We bought them a house but with stipulations. All credit cards were canceled, they can't get new ones, I have access to their bank, I pay their bills (all electronic, so not a big deal) and tell them how much they have left for the month. We had to teach people in their 80s how to budget. It is hard. I want to scream sometimes. We are constantly the bad guys because they can't spend like they are used to. Not a road I recommend. Just say no, you're tapped out.", "NTA\n\nIf you're not obviously wealthy, tell them something like *\"You wrecked jy credit when I co-signed for your car and you never bothered paying it off so now I can't afford to help you\"* and leave it at that\n\nI know it's not ideal to lie to people but in this case it seems like the much easier/smarter option than trying to reason with them or letting yourself be guilted, plus there's a tiny chance they might come to understand the consequences of their actions", "Whelp.  I guess they better sell the rest of their fentanyl because you have no obligation to help them.  Hold your ground.\n\n\\-NTA", "Nope he has already done way too much. It's just a vicious circle.", "I mean if they haven\u2019t learned by now, I doubt things are going to change. It\u2019s a tough spot b/c who wants to essentially let their parents get evicted, but at the end of the day you\u2019ve done more than enough to help them out. Don\u2019t feel guilty at all OP. \n\nNTA", "NTA on the grounds that this is the 4th and it sounds like they haven't learned their lesson. If it was their first I would say compassion is needed, but it sounds more like they keep living above their means an expecting others to bail them out. Only $35 a month average on a car for 4 years? The car would run the risk of getting repo'd.\n\nThey need to learn financial responsibility, something less and less seem to get these days.", "NTA, but if you don't pay the landlord will they show up on your doorstep? Will they expect to move in with you? If you pay the money it goes directly to the landlord. Do not give your mom cash, ever. All money you choose to provide for expenses must always go directly to the entity they owe money to. You must make peace with the fact that any money you provide to them will never be repaid.

Eventually you have to let someone fall or hit rock bottom, regardless of their relationship to you. They need more help than you can give. That's not on you.", "NTA.  Sometimes a line has to be drawn.  I think this is your line.  The VA may be able to help them sort things out though.", "NTA.  They are adults and can buck up.", "NTA, what a horrid situation to be in.  At this point, you need to look out for yourself and stop bailing them out.", "NTA. \n\nSometimes you think you're protecting and helping but what you're actually doing us enabling people and protecting them from real world consequences that could teach them a lesson. Comes from a kind place but...Just stop.. Or this will be your life forever. I get it but... No.", "NTA. If you continue to bail them out they will never learn to be financially responsible for themselves. You can offer to look over their finances, help them find a less expensive place to live, help them look for financial assistance to pay for utilities and groceries, but you need to keep your money in your pocket. It would be different if they were doing everything they could possibly do, but it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re doing that. You need to pay your bills and pay yourself first. You should have a rainy day fund as well as a retirement fund or you will wind up just like them.", "NTA. I faced eviction when I was much younger. I took everything \"extra\" and sold it. I even pawned my engagement ring. They can sell their dolls.", "NTA - you're not a bank", "NTA. This is a \"save yourself first\" situation - you've tried helping them and giving them their metaphorical oxygen mask, but they keep pushing it away and prioritizing other things. This is not on you, however painful/awful it is to watch (and to deal with them blaming you).\n\nThey're jumping off a cliff. Don't let them drag you with them. Take care.", "Honestly shocked they managed to find someone who would rent to them after 4 evictions.", "It is their fourth notice of eviction, not fourth eviction.", "I know someone who made that stipulation and the parents were still able to get a home shopping tv type credit card and all kinds of pay in increments deals. Still a mess.", "If they get VA income they may be disabled veterans. I could be wrong but landlords may not be able to deny them because they're a protected class.", "Agreed, this isn't their first eviction notice, it's their *4th*. OP has bailed them out one too many times and OP constantly bailing them out means they'll never learn to not spend money on stupid shit, they just keep doing it while expecting OP to pay through the nose to keep a roof over their heads.\n\nIt's time for the Bank of OP to close.", "Or the landlords are nice people", "> If they get VA income they may be disabled veterans. I could be wrong but landlords may not be able to deny them because they're a protected class.\n\nLandlords can discriminate against people who are in a protected class as long as they don't discriminate on the basis of a protected class. If that wasn't the case, they wouldn't be able to turn anyone away since everyone has a race, sex, etc."]}
