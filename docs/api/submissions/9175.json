I repeatedly told her not to do this, because it was weird, I didn't really need her help and I was already doing quite well in school- but she insisted that she was helping me, and kept doing it. I locked her out of my account twice, but both times was persuaded by her to give her my password again. She's my mom, so what can you do?\n\nAnyways, she eventually writes an email to an organization signing me up to volunteer- I would have gladly done it, but the problem was that I had a Model UN conference that day, so now I had to explain to the organizer who was expecting me to come that I had to cancel last-minute, making me look like a real jerk. I was pretty upset with my mom for putting me in this spot, but whatever. I told her off about her not even mentioning or asking me whether I was busy before signing me up, but she said that it was my fault for never telling her when my conference was. I maintained that 1) she never asked, because if she did I would have happily told her, and 2) she shouldn't have signed me up without my permission or telling me regardless.\n\nI sent an email to the organizer informing them that they had been talking to my mom in the past few emails instead of me, and that it was her that had signed me up. I didn't make her look bad- just told the facts, apologized for making them have to find a replacement so late, and said that if there were any other opportunities for volunteering, that I would be in touch. \n\nThat made my mom so mad that she refused to talk to me, even without reading the email. My dad was also pretty pissed off at me, though not as much as my mom- he said that I had part of the blame to take as well, as I had let my mom have access to my email, so I was kind of asking for it to happen. Also, he said that she was my mom, and was only trying to help me before I threw her under the bus in the email by blaming her to the organizer. I guess that is true, but would it have been better for me to lie and say that it was my fault, and that I had messed up the planning? I've done it before, but this time I just felt so fed up. Maybe I did make the wrong decision, though.\n\nAnyways, I was just wondering what you guys thought about it. Pretty much my entire family is against me here, but was what I did really that bad? I've thought about it a long time, and I really don't think so- but if I really am the asshole here, please let me know so I can apologize to my mom and change.", "created_utc": 1675571053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u14xq/aita_for_telling_the_truth_about_my_mom_instead/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is NOT normal for parents to impersonate their children.\n\nWhy is your mother choosing to do things that she's so embarrassed about? Why is it her child's responsibility to cover up for her?\n\nI keep wondering if there's more to the story. When you gave your mother your password, did you have a mutual agreement to how she would use it?", "NTA \n\nShe can\u2019t be signing you up to stuff without even talking to you or asking.

How will you learn to do something for yourself when you are never allowed to do it?\n\nShe made herself look bad because she lied and impersonated you. I would tell her that she was definitely in the wrong - not just because she lied, not just because she is trying to teach you to not accept the blame for one's own actions - but that she removed this as an option for you. Since her lies hurt the agency's ability to provide a service due to inadequate staffing, they likely won't allow you to help in the future because they won't know who they are talking to. Let her know that she is destroying your ability to volunteer since the places she contacts are all going to instantly go onto your \"never\" list. If she persists in this behavior there will be no opportunities left because she permanently killed any chance you had for those options.\n\nAsk her if she thinks you should help your Dad find better opportunities by impersonating him. You can make a dating profile for him and find him a new wife who isn't a crazy control freak who demands to be allowed to hurt him. Maybe you'd get a new Mommy who loves and respects you.
