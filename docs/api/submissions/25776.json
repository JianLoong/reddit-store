{"id": 25776, "submission_id": "164d12x", "title": "AITA for asking my mum to not give presents to my nephews in front of my son?", "selftext": "Growing up we lived far away from my grandparents and so had a different relationship with them than my cousins who saw them every day. Grandparents treated us differently and constantly treated me as the black sheep (though at 7 years old not sure exactly what I did!!) mostly because I didn\u2019t act like my cousins. Grandparents looked after them when my aunt and uncle were at work so basically raised them. I hated it and used to dread going to visit.\n\nFast forward 30 years and I (38f) and my wife (39f) have a little one (2m) and in a similar situation where we lived 6hrs away from my parents. My sister and her family (4m and 2m) live an hour away so see them regularly.\nI know that our children will have different relationships with my parents purely because of how often they see them, but I make sure we video call, visit and talk about them so that they are not strangers.\n\nA few weeks ago I took my son to stay with my parents for a few days. We had a lovely time and when we were there my dad bought my son some toy cars.\n\nThe next day my sister came over with her boys and my mum called them into the living room saying \u201cboys follow me\u201d. Naturally my son followed.\nShe then gave my nephews a present each.\nMy little ones face was heartbreaking as he didn\u2019t understand why everyone got given a present but he didn\u2019t. I bent down and said to him \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go and get the cars grandma and grandad got you to show your cousins.\u201d I was trying to gently remind him that he had also been given a gift but it had been the day before.\n\nLater that evening I was talking with my mum and she bought up how my grandparents had treated us differently. I said looking back I can understand why we had a different relationship but at the time it was hard. I said that I know they will do more with my nephews, but that I\u2019d make sure my son understood he was just as important. I then took this opportunity (I wasn\u2019t previously planning on saying anything) to say that they (my parents) could help by not doing things that might appear to be treating them differently, such as giving my nephews presents in front of my son if there\u2019s nothing for him. He\u2019s 2 years old. He doesn\u2019t grasp the concept that he got something earlier. It\u2019s a bit like giving one kid one present and another 6. The total cost might be the same but kids will see one got more than the other.\n\nMy mum\u2019s response was that I am keeping track of who gets what and it\u2019s up to her what she does and who she buys gifts for.\n\nI think she\u2019s missing the point and my sister says I\u2019m TA for bringing it up,\nI hadn\u2019t planned to at all it\u2019s just how the conversation went.\nI don\u2019t want my son to feel like I did and will always make sure he feels equal to his cousins. \n\nAITA here? His face broke my heart and I thought I dealt with it well but now it feels like I\u2019ve created a massive issue.\n\n\nEdit 1 - following some of the comments I re-read my post and am adding things for clarity.\n\n1. The only reason I said anything is because my mum asked me directly \u201cwhat can we do to make sure \u201cx\u201d doesn\u2019t feel like we treat him differently?\u201d My response was \u201ctreat them the same - for example if you have something to give my nephews include him or don\u2019t give it in front of him\u201d\n\n2. It wasn\u2019t a birthday or other celebratory occasion. My mum saw something she thought one nephew would like and got something for the other so he wouldn\u2019t feel left out (her words)\n\n3. We all went to a train museum and I bought each of the boys a train as a treat. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I wouldn\u2019t do one without doing all three.\n\n4. My kid doesn\u2019t always get what he wants and yeah we deal with those melt downs and move on - just like any toddler.\n\n5. When we arrived at my parents I saw the things mum had bought on the side and thought it was something my nephews had left behind on a previous visit. \nWhen we were out I asked my dad to stop at a particular shop so I could get cough medicine. That\u2019s where my son saw the thing he liked and my dad got it for him. If we hadn\u2019t stopped he wouldn\u2019t have received anything during our visit. I don\u2019t have an issue with this as he probably already has too much stuff like most kids. It\u2019s the fact that my mum asked me how to she could make sure he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s treated differently, while treating them differently that confuses me.\n\n6. Yes I have issues and over think things. Dealing with this through therapy and will raise the points people have made. My wife is very good at bringing me back to reality. Note to self - don\u2019t do these trips without her!!!!\n\n7. Any parent hates to see their kid sad, but not only did he look sad he said he was naughty therefore making me think he thought he didn\u2019t get a gift because he was naughty in some way.", "created_utc": 1693299253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164d12x/aita_for_asking_my_mum_to_not_give_presents_to_my/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Otherwise, there would\u2019ve been no present for your son at all and only for the other children. \n\nThis is incredibly rude and unfair of your mother. It gives the impression of favouritism for her nephews and, understandable makes your son feel left out. \n\nWho on earth gets all the kids together, buys gifts for all of them except one?! That\u2019s insane", "NTA, at 2 a kid has trouble understanding I got my gift yesterday, they get theirs today and they weren't even equivalent by the sounds of it.\n\nAs kids, I remember opening up a lot of Christmas gifts very early one year. My cousin was spending Christmas with us. While our shared grandparents gifted similarly to all of us- our non-shared grandparents didn't.

OP: take a breath. \"It\u2019s a bit like giving one kid one present and another 6.\" No, it's not.

Sounds like you redirected fairly well and all was well. TBH, your mom probably could have just rewrapped a book or one of the cars and your son wouldn\u2019t really clock it, he probably just wanted to be a part of the opening process. \n\nIt\u2019s fair to request in the future that all kids be given the gifts at the same time or she gives you a heads up so you can already redirect. It does sound like you\u2019re overthinking/over analyzing a bit more than necessary so I think it\u2019s good that you\u2019re having the conversation with your parents. Seems like there\u2019s intentional effort on both sides to make sure things are as equal as possible.", "YTA \n\n\nSeeing other children get things (when they don't) is an important life lesson. \n\n\nYes, your child is only 2, but that's not too early to start teaching. \n\n\nThis isn't something thata going to cause trauma to your child and I'm sure they were over it pretty quickly. \n\n\nYou shouldn't be asking people to adjust reasonable behaviour to avoid a tantrum or upset. \n\n\nThis is how you end up with children who expect presents when they go to another child's party", "YTA. They had already given your kid a gift and not the others. It\u2019s not like they were just giving the other kids presents and not yours. I also think it\u2019s a good lesson to teach a child that they don\u2019t get a present just because someone else does. Again- the fact that your kid already got a gift just needs to be reinforced with your child, but your family is right. You are projecting your own issues and using it to try and control interactions when your parents were perfectly fair.", "YTA, your intentions were good but kids need to learn that sometimes they aren\u2019t going to get a gift.  If it\u2019s someone else\u2019s birthday or a graduation or something then they will get nothing.\n\nYour intentions were good but I think you are projecting your feelings in this situation.  Two year olds aren\u2019t that deep.  You absolutely did the right thing in reminding him that he had already received his gift.\n\nHistory doesn\u2019t have to repeat itself.  With FaceTime and regular visits your son will be able to build a relationship with his grandparents.", "***My little ones face was heartbreaking*** *as he didn\u2019t understand why everyone got given a present but he didn\u2019t* \n\nThe amount of times you people use such bs, portraying your kid as the ultimate victim of society is honestly so disgusting... *he was heartbroken*, *his crocodile tears were heartbreaking*, *his sad face was heartbreaking,* everything around you is heartbreaking, ohh the drama is too much. \n\nWell guess what, your job as a parent is to explain things to your kid so that he knows that the world does not revolve around him or his wants. Of course he did not understand why his cousins received a toy that particular day and he did not, but YOUR JOB was to explain to him the reasons why that happened and that was all. Your entitlement to ask you mother to not give gifts to her other grandkids in front of your little one was awful. YTA", "YTA. \n\nI have sisters who both have their own kids. I have none of my own. It gets so utterly tiring watching everyone keep score of who gets what and why. \n\nYou even said that your son got given a present before the nephews. Yes he was upset that he didn't get anything when they did, but it is your job as his parent to explain that he got a present earlier and to teach him that he won't get something every time someone else does. Otherwise, you're just setting him up to failure. You're also just going to alienate your own parents who will feel damned if they do and damned if they don't. Maybe your parents could have waited to give your son his present when nephews were there? But when and to whom they give presents is their choice.", "NTA for making the request. No harm in asking. If you start demanding things in their house then things change a bit. If your mom doesn't agree, your option is to not bring your son over to their place while the other kids are present.\n\nSeeing other children get gifts and not receive anything  himself is something that he will need to be exposed to and get used to at some point especially if he's going to attend his cousins for birthday parties since they live somewhat close. That is something to discuss with your SO how and when this exposure is done.", "NTA. I'd limit access if your parents keep being assholes. Your child's self-esteem is .ore important than having a toxic relationship with your parents.", "ETA\n\nYou are projecting - your parents aren't your grandparents.\n\nYour parents could be more sensitive to your feelings, especially since they know about your feelings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they never went anywhere the boy wouldn't get a thing.", "The issue is not how many gifts were offered, but when.", "Ok so how would you relationally and reasonably explain that to a two year old? \n\nOP isn\u2019t saying you must buy my son, she saying don\u2019t give the others in front of him. \n\nPerfectly reasonable.", "She said the only reason he got a day before was, that she had to go into a shop to buy something (cough medicine if I remember correctly) and her son saw something he liked and his grandpa bought it for him. If she hadn't needed the medicine, they wouldn't have been there and her son would have been left out.\n\nHer mother could have waited till they are home again, because she sees her other grandkids way more often.\n\nThere was no need to do that in front of a two year old boy, who didn't understand why he was left out.\n\nSo OP is NTA here.", "There has indeed been a substantial edit made. OPs mother directly asking the question, after having the presents already to go for the others, and OPs child gift being an  impulse purchase by Grandfather sets the scenario differently.\n\n Indeed, OPs child should not be treated as an afterthought, I was not suggesting they should be.  \n\nOPs edit also includes the fear projection, and they're working on this. Unfortunately for OP, they do live a long way off, things are going to be different between his child and his parents compared to the others. There is a risk that this could always be a problem for them: If it's not that the children get gifts in front of them, it could be the gifts they receive when OP isn't there. \n\nI agree that OP was right to say something to his mother in this scenario.", "Read her edit! He only got a gift the day before, because OP and her father had to go to the shop to buy some medicine. If she wouldn't have needed something he wouldn't have got anything.", "Who hurt you?", "Not because her nephews got a gift. Because the gift was given in front of the son.\n\nAnd \"hey maybe it might be best not to treat the grandkids unequally in front of each other\" isn't a toddler reaction.", "Probably grandma.", "They weren't treated unequally all got a present \n\nIf o gave my little brother a \u20ac5 today and gave my little cousin \u20ac5 tomorrow were they treated unequally?", "I guess you haven't spent a lot of time with a two year old? Their prefrontal cortex is still developing. They don't have a great grasp of cause and effect and they often don't have the cognitive flexibility to use the past to interpret present events.\n\nExperiences have such a great potential to affect brain development and children are especially vulnerable to persistent negative influences during this period. That is why we have to use more care, as adults, when dealing  with their emotions.\n\nBut sure, this BS benefits noone /s", "You're such a dumbass lmao", "I guess you haven\u2019t spent much time with one.

It's hard being a toddler. They have so many big emotions.", "What greandparent does stuff like this??? I find it super unkind. Plus, when you brought it up, she missed the point completely. Your sister is upset because she doesn't want your mom to stop buying her kids stuff and is happy with the status quo. Your mom could have easily saved the gifts for your nephews for after your visit. NTA OP and I would be a bit concerned about leaving your son alone with her based on her preferential treatment and because he is 2 and can't tell you if something happened.", "NTA I've been on both sides of this, funny enough. My mom was the black sheep of the family. At Christmas time, her parents would by my cousins expensive gifts. Game systems, bikes, mice clothes. We (myself and my siblings) got socks and dollar store gifts, and we were expected to be grateful. They'd also get random gifts in front of us other times of the year. We didn't get birthday gifts, and they did. My mom is an addict and we were poor and didn't have nice things to begin with. Sometimes, we didn't even have food or clothes that fit. My cousins, on the other hand, had middle class parents, a nice house, pool, and got spoiled by our grandparents. It felt like shit. My step family did the same thing. They'd just flat out not have anything for me. They'd conveniently forget I existed even though I was with my mom every weekend and during the summer. Even though I'd been a part of their family since I was 2. As a little kid that shit hurts. And it sticks with you. \n\nOn the other side, because my mom was such a shit mother, my single dad got custody of me. Because he always worked third, I basically lived with his parents. They had as much, if not more, of a hand in raising me than my parents. I had my own room and my own toy boxes at their house. They definitely doted on me more than my cousins, who lived a few blocks over. I got more and sometimes better Christmas presents from them. However, none of that was ever done in front of my cousins. We did family Christmas on Christmas Eve, and I opened the same amount, similar gifts from them during family Christmas. The better and more presents were opened in the morning and were from Santa. As we got older, it was explained to my cousins that my grandparents were basically my parents and that Grandma was my mother figure because mine was so awful. No resentment was created. Grandma and Grandpa did it right. \n\nNTA, your request is 100% reasonable. You're not even asking for equality. You're not demanding that they give as much to your kid as they give to the others. You're just asking for discretion when there is a disparity in gifts. Especially during an age when reasoning skills aren't present in your child yet.", "NTA.\n\nWhen I was a kid and it was a gifting occasion, my older sister always got the \u201cmain character\u201d doll and I got the side character/villain. She got Rainbow bright, I got Stormy, etc.\n\nI know my aunts and uncles love me, but this kinda bugs me to this day \ud83d\ude05. And if you know who Rainbow Brite is, you know how long ago that was \ud83e\udd23.", "NTA - your Mum should know it too when she bought it for 1 child specifically and the other so he wasn't left out but got your Son nothing? \n\nYour Sister would kick up a fuss if it happened the other way, that's why she said something! \n\nWell done for telling her, children don't understand but they also don't forget. Next time she needs to cover them all, get a few cheap things in for when they visit OR don't do it in front of the other.", "That poor little kid. I can only imagine hoe he felt. Your mum is the enemy in this relationship. If you can't stop her from doing this, you can stop her from seeing your son.", "NTA. Your mom is just mad at herself for not noticing that she\u2019s already doing the thing she meant to avoid and lashing out at you for pointing it out.", "NTA. I may feel the way I do specifically because I lived out both scenarios.  \n\nScenario 1: My cousin is now like a second sister and I couldn\u2019t love her more. She is an amazing person and my sister and I both think of her as the third piece of the whole but it wasn\u2019t always like that in no small part because of a mutual aunt & uncle who decided early on that my cousin was their favourite among the nieces and nephews. That aunt and uncle created rivalry  and resentment and hurt that never needed to be there.  They would take a bunch of the cousins places then buy only the one gifts and souvenirs while the others got nothing. They would talk about openly their favourite niece. They were all around blatantly preferential in their treatment and made it clear who they liked and knew best. We are all grown arsed adults now and have been for a long time but it has taken decades to undo a lot of that hurt and I would be lying if I said there weren\u2019t a few of the cousins who, like OP, still harbour some measure of ill will because of it. \n\nYou are right. Kids don\u2019t understand. The other cousins blamed but also idealized the favourite and the favourite was honestly a little oblivious (because it all seemed normal to her). She was also left wondering why sometimes the others were super mean to her in retaliation for something that was beyond the children\u2019s control. Fortunately my cousin grew up to be a wonderful person as did the others so we have mostly managed to work it out in adulthood but it was all so unnecessary. \n\nMy cousin was full on horrified when she had children of her own and it started playing out in the next generation w the same aunt and uncle and her kids.  The rest of us were like, \u201cyah, welcome to our childhood - there is a reason why they are no one else\u2019s fav aunt and uncle\u201d.  \n\nScenario 2: My sister and I always felt left out because we thought we were not invited when all the other cousins were. We learned later that we were invited but my mother would never let us go. She was like OP. She wasn\u2019t willing to watch it play out in a toxic way. Limited exposure is probably why it was easier for my sister and I to let go of it as grew. We had fewer painful memories and our mother helped us understand. I remember laughing w my mother, who was nevertheless quite annoyed, about an outting w the cousin and the aunt and uncle when we were super young adults and they were buying her all sorts of things. I was old enough not to expect it or care but it was super tacky since we were both young uns starting out. Apparently the cousin had a greater need for throw cushions. Lol. \n\nAnyhoo, when we weee really young my mom used to look after my cousin a lot and she would be very careful to behave in the way OP asked of her parents. There was never a time that my sister and I got something and my cousin was left standing there empty handed. There were either three given or the giving was done when she was not there.  I also remember more than a few lectures about inclusivity from my mother. Not sure what went down in her household when she was young but she had a heart like OP.  That shite was not going down on her watch.  \n\nKeep doing what you are doing OP. Protect your child. Call out the most blatant examples of favouritism and reduce exposure / mitigate harm if you can\u2019t make your parents see how their behaviour is impacting all the cousins and their future relationship w one another. Try to explain as he gets older. Model the behaviour you want to see when you are w your nieces and nephews.  Do what you can do. Your parents aren\u2019t intentionally being cruel but their actions have the potential for great harm. You sound like a good parent. Keep doing what you are doing.", "NTA, you\u2019re right they treat him differently, which is pretty mean to a toddler. Especially if they haven\u2019t even planned to give him anything.\n\nYou should consider to go low contact with them, because as the kids grow this favouritism going to be more and more and it\u2019s really going to hurt him.", "NTA\n\nYour mum sounds like a witch. Get your dad to understand and shower your little one with the love and attention that he deserves. \n\nAlso maybe start doing regular FaceTime with the grandparents so your little gets used to their presence in his life.", "NTA.", "NTA.\nThis happened to me as a kid and it\u2019s not a nice feeling. If they can\u2019t do the same for your child, you should take measures to make sure that your child is around people who make them feel valued.\n\nI know people may freak out and say oh you\u2019re saying to cut them off. No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m saying that as adults we need to be mindful of things that may damage a child\u2019s sense of self-worth. And it\u2019s not like he want an entitled child but if everyone\u2019s getting a hug in a room, except for one kid or a big production is being made of getting random presents for two children and one is left out, that can cause long lasting resentment and issues.", "NTA\n\nCan we talk about your som thinking he was \"naughty\" for not getting a gift?\nWhere did he pick up that idea??", "NTA. After reading your further info that your son would not have been gifted anything except for the previous day\u2019s circumstances especially NTA. My dad is one of 6 kids and the only one to move out of province. 4 of his siblings had kids and it\u2019s 10 grandkids in total. Everyone else is within a 30min drive except my dad and I who are a 2.5hr plane ride away. I very much understand concerns of feeling left out. \n\nIn this situation your grandparents have plenty of other opportunities to gift the kids presents, there was no need to do it in front of your son or even when your son was there. You\u2019re leaving soon and she\u2019d have the rest of the year to give that present.", "NTA. Actually, it's your child with a 2-year-old brain that's keeping track of who's getting gifts. The adults are supposed to be conscious of that.", "Your mom is being thoughtless, but your kid is 2.  He knows he's not getting a gift, but he's far too young to make the leap that it must be because he's been bad.  Give me a break.", "He's 2 years old. YTA. No wonder kids are so entitled these days.", "NTA because your mom asked and your were honest with her. Would your son of gotten a little gift too had you not stopped for the medicine? Doesn\u2019t sound like he would\u2019ve.", "NTA. I was the grandkid that wasn\u2019t treated the same as my sister (she was favoured) but my mom shut that down hard. Your sister should be saying to your mom that while she appreciates that she thought of her boys, she has all three grandkids right now and should have bought something for your little one. The fact that your sister says your AH makes me question the dynamic your parents and sister have. Because even if your son is currently two, the older he gets the more he\u2019ll question if his gp even likes him and that shit is scarring.", "NTA\nEven your mom knows this or she wouldn't have bought the second item to avoid one of your nephews feeling left out.", "No, this is a massive no. You don't treat kids this way. They are still kids and cannot grasp that they got something earlier. You give them all something at the same time (unless it's a birthday). \n\nWhat you ask was perfectly reasonable. They're AH if they continue to do this. \n\nNTA", "my nanna used to have little boxes for my brothers and i when we came to visit filled with small gifts as well as a gift card to barnes & noble we could use for anything we wanted. i *loved* them, we called them nanna boxes. i was much older when i learned she didn\u2019t do this for all her grandkids. it made me feel very sad for my cousins knowing they were treated differently than us, and kind of pissed off at my nanna. it wasn\u2019t fair. we visited more often but that wasn\u2019t *my* choice anymore than it was my cousins\u2019 choice. this kind of stuff can build resentment between the cousins, and if the nephews have any sense of empathy at all, it can build resentment between them and grandma as they grow older. \n\ngrandma is not treating them equally, and you are absolutely nta for bringing it up. *especially* given your edit. he would never have gotten a gift at all had you not needed to go to the shop, and he still would have had to see his cousins get gifts. your mom is absolutely in the wrong here.", "No compassionate Nana would do that. I\u2019m appalled honestly. Little kids totally notice stuff like that.", "Your grandparents sound like really nice people! \nI am glad that they were there for you!", "He was excluded. He is 2, his gift could have been from a gumball machine and he would have been happy.", "Scrolled forever to find something other than an NTA. Maybe i misread, but it sounded like the grandparents treated all the kids equally, right? All the kids received a gift of equal value from the grandparents, with OP's child receiving his on Day 1 and nephews receiving theirs on Day 2. \n\nSounds like OP is actively building generational trauma and encouraging their child to feel hurt. Simply sticking with the 'you got your gift yesterday' approach then letting it go and allowing all of the cousins to have fun playing with their toys together would have been a happier outcome.", "There are behavioral milestones based on age.
