{"id": 25776, "submission_id": "164d12x", "title": "AITA for asking my mum to not give presents to my nephews in front of my son?", "selftext": "Growing up we lived far away from my grandparents and so had a different relationship with them than my cousins who saw them every day. Grandparents treated us differently and constantly treated me as the black sheep (though at 7 years old not sure exactly what I did!!) mostly because I didn\u2019t act like my cousins. Grandparents looked after them when my aunt and uncle were at work so basically raised them. I hated it and used to dread going to visit.\n\nFast forward 30 years and I (38f) and my wife (39f) have a little one (2m) and in a similar situation where we lived 6hrs away from my parents. My sister and her family (4m and 2m) live an hour away so see them regularly.\nI know that our children will have different relationships with my parents purely because of how often they see them, but I make sure we video call, visit and talk about them so that they are not strangers.\n\nA few weeks ago I took my son to stay with my parents for a few days. We had a lovely time and when we were there my dad bought my son some toy cars.\n\nThe next day my sister came over with her boys and my mum called them into the living room saying \u201cboys follow me\u201d. Naturally my son followed.\nShe then gave my nephews a present each.\nMy little ones face was heartbreaking as he didn\u2019t understand why everyone got given a present but he didn\u2019t. I bent down and said to him \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go and get the cars grandma and grandad got you to show your cousins.\u201d I was trying to gently remind him that he had also been given a gift but it had been the day before.\n\nLater that evening I was talking with my mum and she bought up how my grandparents had treated us differently. I said looking back I can understand why we had a different relationship but at the time it was hard. I said that I know they will do more with my nephews, but that I\u2019d make sure my son understood he was just as important. I then took this opportunity (I wasn\u2019t previously planning on saying anything) to say that they (my parents) could help by not doing things that might appear to be treating them differently, such as giving my nephews presents in front of my son if there\u2019s nothing for him. He\u2019s 2 years old. He doesn\u2019t grasp the concept that he got something earlier. It\u2019s a bit like giving one kid one present and another 6. The total cost might be the same but kids will see one got more than the other.\n\nMy mum\u2019s response was that I am keeping track of who gets what and it\u2019s up to her what she does and who she buys gifts for.\n\nI think she\u2019s missing the point and my sister says I\u2019m TA for bringing it up,\nI hadn\u2019t planned to at all it\u2019s just how the conversation went.\nI don\u2019t want my son to feel like I did and will always make sure he feels equal to his cousins. \n\nAITA here? His face broke my heart and I thought I dealt with it well but now it feels like I\u2019ve created a massive issue.\n\n\nEdit 1 - following some of the comments I re-read my post and am adding things for clarity.\n\n1. The only reason I said anything is because my mum asked me directly \u201cwhat can we do to make sure \u201cx\u201d doesn\u2019t feel like we treat him differently?\u201d My response was \u201ctreat them the same - for example if you have something to give my nephews include him or don\u2019t give it in front of him\u201d\n\n2. It wasn\u2019t a birthday or other celebratory occasion. My mum saw something she thought one nephew would like and got something for the other so he wouldn\u2019t feel left out (her words)\n\n3. We all went to a train museum and I bought each of the boys a train as a treat. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I wouldn\u2019t do one without doing all three.\n\n4. My kid doesn\u2019t always get what he wants and yeah we deal with those melt downs and move on - just like any toddler.\n\n5. When we arrived at my parents I saw the things mum had bought on the side and thought it was something my nephews had left behind on a previous visit. \nWhen we were out I asked my dad to stop at a particular shop so I could get cough medicine. That\u2019s where my son saw the thing he liked and my dad got it for him. If we hadn\u2019t stopped he wouldn\u2019t have received anything during our visit. I don\u2019t have an issue with this as he probably already has too much stuff like most kids. It\u2019s the fact that my mum asked me how to she could make sure he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s treated differently, while treating them differently that confuses me.\n\n6. Yes I have issues and over think things. Dealing with this through therapy and will raise the points people have made. My wife is very good at bringing me back to reality. Note to self - don\u2019t do these trips without her!!!!\n\n7. Any parent hates to see their kid sad, but not only did he look sad he said he was naughty therefore making me think he thought he didn\u2019t get a gift because he was naughty in some way.", "created_utc": 1693299253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164d12x/aita_for_asking_my_mum_to_not_give_presents_to_my/", "score": 448, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Otherwise, there would\u2019ve been no present for your son at all and only for the other children. \n\nThis is incredibly rude and unfair of your mother. It gives the impression of favouritism for her nephews and, understandable makes your son feel left out. \n\nWho on earth gets all the kids together, buys gifts for all of them except one?! That\u2019s insane", "NTA, at 2 a kid has trouble understanding I got my gift yesterday, they get theirs today and they weren't even equivalent by the sounds of it.\n\nAs kids, I remember opening up a lot of Christmas gifts very early one year. My cousin was spending Christmas with us. While our shared grandparents gifted similarly to all of us- our non-shared grandparents didn't. My mom didn't want to create a situation where we kept opening more and more gifts while he just sat there. We were also older at that point where it would be understood, but for any kid that can uncomfortable at best.", "NTA. One of my Nana's treated me and my sister differently to my cousins.

OP: take a breath. \"It\u2019s a bit like giving one kid one present and another 6.\" No, it's not.

Sounds like you redirected fairly well and all was well. TBH, your mom probably could have just rewrapped a book or one of the cars and your son wouldn\u2019t really clock it, he probably just wanted to be a part of the opening process. \n\nIt\u2019s fair to request in the future that all kids be given the gifts at the same time or she gives you a heads up so you can already redirect. It does sound like you\u2019re overthinking/over analyzing a bit more than necessary so I think it\u2019s good that you\u2019re having the conversation with your parents. Seems like there\u2019s intentional effort on both sides to make sure things are as equal as possible.", "YTA \n\n\nSeeing other children get things (when they don't) is an important life lesson. \n\n\nYes, your child is only 2, but that's not too early to start teaching. \n\n\nThis isn't something thata going to cause trauma to your child and I'm sure they were over it pretty quickly. \n\n\nYou shouldn't be asking people to adjust reasonable behaviour to avoid a tantrum or upset. \n\n\nThis is how you end up with children who expect presents when they go to another child's party", "YTA. They had already given your kid a gift and not the others. It\u2019s not like they were just giving the other kids presents and not yours. I also think it\u2019s a good lesson to teach a child that they don\u2019t get a present just because someone else does. Again- the fact that your kid already got a gift just needs to be reinforced with your child, but your family is right. You are projecting your own issues and using it to try and control interactions when your parents were perfectly fair.", "YTA, your intentions were good but kids need to learn that sometimes they aren\u2019t going to get a gift.  If it\u2019s someone else\u2019s birthday or a graduation or something then they will get nothing.\n\nYour intentions were good but I think you are projecting your feelings in this situation.  Two year olds aren\u2019t that deep.  You absolutely did the right thing in reminding him that he had already received his gift.\n\nHistory doesn\u2019t have to repeat itself.  With FaceTime and regular visits your son will be able to build a relationship with his grandparents.", "***My little ones face was heartbreaking*** *as he didn\u2019t understand why everyone got given a present but he didn\u2019t* \n\nThe amount of times you people use such bs, portraying your kid as the ultimate victim of society is honestly so disgusting... *he was heartbroken*, *his crocodile tears were heartbreaking*, *his sad face was heartbreaking,* everything around you is heartbreaking, ohh the drama is too much. \n\nWell guess what, your job as a parent is to explain things to your kid so that he knows that the world does not revolve around him or his wants. Of course he did not understand why his cousins received a toy that particular day and he did not, but YOUR JOB was to explain to him the reasons why that happened and that was all. Your entitlement to ask you mother to not give gifts to her other grandkids in front of your little one was awful. YTA", "YTA. \n\nI have sisters who both have their own kids. I have none of my own. It gets so utterly tiring watching everyone keep score of who gets what and why. \n\nYou even said that your son got given a present before the nephews. Yes he was upset that he didn't get anything when they did, but it is your job as his parent to explain that he got a present earlier and to teach him that he won't get something every time someone else does. Otherwise, you're just setting him up to failure. You're also just going to alienate your own parents who will feel damned if they do and damned if they don't. Maybe your parents could have waited to give your son his present when nephews were there? But when and to whom they give presents is their choice.", "NTA for making the request. No harm in asking. If you start demanding things in their house then things change a bit. If your mom doesn't agree, your option is to not bring your son over to their place while the other kids are present.\n\nSeeing other children get gifts and not receive anything  himself is something that he will need to be exposed to and get used to at some point especially if he's going to attend his cousins for birthday parties since they live somewhat close. That is something to discuss with your SO how and when this exposure is done.", "NTA. I'd limit access if your parents keep being assholes. Your child's self-esteem is .ore important than having a toxic relationship with your parents.", "ETA\n\nYou are projecting - your parents aren't your grandparents.\n\nYour parents could be more sensitive to your feelings, especially since they know about your feelings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mom was the black sheep of the family. At Christmas time, her parents would by my cousins expensive gifts. Game systems, bikes, mice clothes. We (myself and my siblings) got socks and dollar store gifts, and we were expected to be grateful. They'd also get random gifts in front of us other times of the year. We didn't get birthday gifts, and they did. My mom is an addict and we were poor and didn't have nice things to begin with. Sometimes, we didn't even have food or clothes that fit. My cousins, on the other hand, had middle class parents, a nice house, pool, and got spoiled by our grandparents. It felt like shit. My step family did the same thing. They'd just flat out not have anything for me. They'd conveniently forget I existed even though I was with my mom every weekend and during the summer. Even though I'd been a part of their family since I was 2. As a little kid that shit hurts. And it sticks with you. \n\nOn the other side, because my mom was such a shit mother, my single dad got custody of me. Because he always worked third, I basically lived with his parents. They had as much, if not more, of a hand in raising me than my parents. I had my own room and my own toy boxes at their house. They definitely doted on me more than my cousins, who lived a few blocks over. I got more and sometimes better Christmas presents from them. However, none of that was ever done in front of my cousins. We did family Christmas on Christmas Eve, and I opened the same amount, similar gifts from them during family Christmas. The better and more presents were opened in the morning and were from Santa. As we got older, it was explained to my cousins that my grandparents were basically my parents and that Grandma was my mother figure because mine was so awful. No resentment was created. Grandma and Grandpa did it right. \n\nNTA, your request is 100% reasonable. You're not even asking for equality. You're not demanding that they give as much to your kid as they give to the others. You're just asking for discretion when there is a disparity in gifts.

Next time she needs to cover them all, get a few cheap things in for when they visit OR don't do it in front of the other.", "That poor little kid. I can only imagine hoe he felt. Your mum is the enemy in this relationship. If you can't stop her from doing this, you can stop her from seeing your son.", "NTA. Your mom is just mad at herself for not noticing that she\u2019s already doing the thing she meant to avoid and lashing out at you for pointing it out.", "NTA. I may feel the way I do specifically because I lived out both scenarios.  \n\nScenario 1: My cousin is now like a second sister and I couldn\u2019t love her more. She is an amazing person and my sister and I both think of her as the third piece of the whole but it wasn\u2019t always like that in no small part because of a mutual aunt & uncle who decided early on that my cousin was their favourite among the nieces and nephews. That aunt and uncle created rivalry  and resentment and hurt that never needed to be there.  They would take a bunch of the cousins places then buy only the one gifts and souvenirs while the others got nothing. They would talk about openly their favourite niece. They were all around blatantly preferential in their treatment and made it clear who they liked and knew best. We are all grown arsed adults now and have been for a long time but it has taken decades to undo a lot of that hurt and I would be lying if I said there weren\u2019t a few of the cousins who, like OP, still harbour some measure of ill will because of it. \n\nYou are right. Kids don\u2019t understand. The other cousins blamed but also idealized the favourite and the favourite was honestly a little oblivious (because it all seemed normal to her). She was also left wondering why sometimes the others were super mean to her in retaliation for something that was beyond the children\u2019s control. Fortunately my cousin grew up to be a wonderful person as did the others so we have mostly managed to work it out in adulthood but it was all so unnecessary. \n\nMy cousin was full on horrified when she had children of her own and it started playing out in the next generation w the same aunt and uncle and her kids.  The rest of us were like, \u201cyah, welcome to our childhood - there is a reason why they are no one else\u2019s fav aunt and uncle\u201d.  \n\nScenario 2: My sister and I always felt left out because we thought we were not invited when all the other cousins were. We learned later that we were invited but my mother would never let us go. She was like OP. She wasn\u2019t willing to watch it play out in a toxic way. Limited exposure is probably why it was easier for my sister and I to let go of it as grew. We had fewer painful memories and our mother helped us understand. I remember laughing w my mother, who was nevertheless quite annoyed, about an outting w the cousin and the aunt and uncle when we were super young adults and they were buying her all sorts of things. I was old enough not to expect it or care but it was super tacky since we were both young uns starting out. Apparently the cousin had a greater need for throw cushions. Lol. \n\nAnyhoo, when we weee really young my mom used to look after my cousin a lot and she would be very careful to behave in the way OP asked of her parents. There was never a time that my sister and I got something and my cousin was left standing there empty handed. There were either three given or the giving was done when she was not there.  I also remember more than a few lectures about inclusivity from my mother. Not sure what went down in her household when she was young but she had a heart like OP.  That shite was not going down on her watch.  \n\nKeep doing what you are doing OP. Protect your child. Call out the most blatant examples of favouritism and reduce exposure / mitigate harm if you can\u2019t make your parents see how their behaviour is impacting all the cousins and their future relationship w one another. Try to explain as he gets older. Model the behaviour you want to see when you are w your nieces and nephews.  Do what you can do. Your parents aren\u2019t intentionally being cruel but their actions have the potential for great harm. You sound like a good parent.

It was an incredibly lonely feeling as a kid to think that no one cared enough about you to stop it or that you were an outsider and maybe you deserved it.\n\nI'm speaking from personal experience and worst case scenarios here but the effects can be far reaching.

I remember being a kid not getting anything but socks and underwear one year for Christmas when my niece and nephew had tons of cool stuff to open and it happened right in front of me. I remember trying hard to hold back my tears (I'm only a few years older than them) because I couldn't understand why they got everything and I got almost nothing. I was a good kid and I thought I'd get something a little better than that. I even tried pretending to be happy for them but eventually I couldn't hold it in and I started to cry. \n\nI never forgot it and things like this stick around. I'm an old lady now and still remember how I felt. Your son may be very young but it doesn't mean that it won't affect him, especially when he gets a little older.", "NTA, been there, my kids are grown up now and have worked it out themselves but it's always made me super sad. And the fact that your mum acknowledged its a possible issue, then doubled down would make me really annoyed too, I don't see that as overthinking. In the end, we just distanced ourselves honestly, the fact that we're further away made it easier to do, it's always felt like we've been invisible, like they forget we're there because we're further away. I'm not sure this helps but you're def not alone", "Nta. You didn\u2019t ask them not to get presents just not to give them in front of your kid.", "NTA\n\nI think they should have been more mindful and just waited til your son wasn\u2019t there to give them the gifts.\n\nBut ultimately long term if the cousins talk at all they\u2019ll realize have different relationships so may need to prepare", "I know how this is my mother never gave presents to my kids. Went to my sisters house for Christmas my mother gave big gifts to her kids but nothing to mine.. my kids cried for not getting anything from grandmom .. My oldest daughter 10 told off grandma and never talked to her again. My 3 boys did the same.. I never spoke to her till she was dying and then left have no idea where she is buried..", "NTA. I was in the same boat as a kid. I lived many states away from my dad's parents and was only with my dad every other Christmas. He wouldn't tell his parents that I was going to be with him and would just show up with me. So I had many Christmas evenings where I got to watch all my cousins open gifts and would have none of my own. I basically claim to have had no grandparents because we never had any type of a relationship (my mom's dad was dead and her mom is mentally ill). Good job setting that boundary.", "NTA. You\u2019re not keeping score, but if your mom keeps this up, your son will.", "NTA -  your mom is a complete idiot, if she thinks it is okay to give two grandchildren gifts when three grandchildren are present.  Unless it is a twins birthday party.  Keeping track , seriously! What two year old would understand they got a gift earlier.  She didn\u2019t even have a gift for him earlier.  Your mom is an insensitive asshat!", "NTA\n\nI was on the fence until I saw edit 5. If it was just the simple mistake of giving him the gift a day early that\u2019s one thing. But as your mother did not intend to give your son a gift at all, that\u2019s blatant favoritism and just plain mean. You handled it great by reminding your son of yesterday\u2019s gift. \n\nI think your son being 2 might be a good thing. He was sad in the moment but probably forgot about it as soon as you mentioned his gift. And at that age he doesn\u2019t realize that grandpa got him those toys and grandma apparently doesn\u2019t care about him at all. Is your mom perhaps a little homophobic? \n\nYour main priority seems to be (and should be) your son\u2019s happiness and wellbeing. You will likely have to protect your son\u2019s feelings from your mom in the future and you\u2019ve already got a head start. I think you\u2019re doing great. \n\nFWIW - My oldest sister had some behavioral issues and when the second oldest was born, my grandma decided the second oldest was somehow to blame for everything the oldest did. She still shows some favoritism 30 years later, it\u2019s inexplicable.", "NTA Why ask if she didn't want some kind of tips?  It sounds like mom wanted you to say \"you don't have to do anything differently, you're already perfect.\"", "NTA - your mother asked and you answered.   If she keeps it up stop going", "But didn't the conversation start because your mom kept track of how *your* grandparents did what for which grandchildren?\n\nIt's pretty hypocritical of her to scrutinize the generation before her but lash out at you for noticing the same behavior in her.\n\nNTA", "YTA. No one is equal in relationships and you're teaching your son to be a victim with no coping skills like you.", "Yeah at first I was ready to say she was overreacting and it\u2019s a teachable moment since they all got a gift just not at the same time. BUT there was originally no gift for OPs son. That\u2019s messed up. It\u2019s amazing the mom was so obtuse as to literally ask about what she could do better in the middle of an exchange that was so neglectful of her grandson\u2019s feelings.", "Yep! My grandparents lived right next door to me growing up. We always did Christmas gifts on Christmas Eve with them because there was understandably more for me than the other grandkids because I was ALWAYS with them. I had one present that I\u2019d get day of with everyone else. It\u2019s totally reasonable that if you\u2019re giving gifts to kids but leave one out (even if the can or can\u2019t understand why) it\u2019s a bit rude.", "This is something I raised with my SO as, as I know it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve done.\nShe said she hasn\u2019t either, but there have been a couple of times when we\u2019ve been out that I\u2019ve seen other parents say it to their kids, so don\u2019t know if he\u2019s picked it up there. Also going to raise it with the childminder tomorrow.", "Flashbacks to when I was a kid in this exact situation. We always all went to my grandma's for easter. My cousins always got easter baskets from her, but me and my brother were \"too old for them\" even though we were the YOUNGEST out of all the kids. It was far from the only favoritism. As a kid I just thought it was because I was \"bad\", and that infuriates me. And my dad wonders why I never talk to that side of the family.", "Two-year-olds don\u2019t really have a concept of yesterday. Even kids several years older than that struggle with stuff like yesterday/today/tomorrow. Also, even a kid old enough to recognise that would understandably be a bit sad about not getting anything when everyone else is getting a gift, especially after grandma (seemingly) asked all of the kids to come with her.", "\ud83e\udec2\ud83e\udec2 best of luck to your burgeoning little family, you're doing right by your bubbies and they're lucky to have you backing em \ud83e\udec2", ">She's used with buying small things for the kids she sees often and handed them over without thinking.\n\nThat's not quite right though\n\nShe saw something she thought Nephew A would like, then bought something for Nephew B _**so he wouldn't feel left out**_ - that's not something that happens without thinking\n\nShe clearly understands that kids can't keep track/end up feeling left out and goes out of her way to avoid such situations arising with OP's nephews, which makes it doubly asshole-y of her to react so poorly when OP asked her to extend similar consideration to his son", "Seems like a good time to remind them then. This is basic parenting stuff.", "Oh damn you said the thing that I said as if that quip somehow overcomes the fact that two year olds are developmentally there yet to understand this kind of thing...", "Ouch", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

When I was little my great aunt babysat my cousin and I and we also lived next door to her. Other cousins she only saw every now and then. Maybe 3 times a year. At Christmas we would open a small toy/candy gift that was the same as everybody else\u2019s and then she would give us a personal gift later after they left. Nobody felt left out because she did this.", "NTA but as a parent I give my nephews things in front of my kids and give them nothing and I do this all the time. My kids don't get gifts from me as they are provided with cars, cloths, vacations, school and every known paid tv/app streaming service known to man. My nephews don't have parents that can afford all of that so I give them things when I see them and my kids may get upset at times but they will get over it plain and simple.", "NTA.

Show your mom your post, maybe she understands then what you meant.", "Can confirm as the kid who was favoured over my siblings and cousins that it builds resentment from the other kids and between Nan and I.
