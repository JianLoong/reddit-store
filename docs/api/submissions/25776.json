{"id": 25776, "submission_id": "164d12x", "title": "AITA for asking my mum to not give presents to my nephews in front of my son?", "selftext": "Growing up we lived far away from my grandparents and so had a different relationship with them than my cousins who saw them every day. Grandparents treated us differently and constantly treated me as the black sheep (though at 7 years old not sure exactly what I did!!) mostly because I didn\u2019t act like my cousins. Grandparents looked after them when my aunt and uncle were at work so basically raised them. I hated it and used to dread going to visit.\n\nFast forward 30 years and I (38f) and my wife (39f) have a little one (2m) and in a similar situation where we lived 6hrs away from my parents. My sister and her family (4m and 2m) live an hour away so see them regularly.\nI know that our children will have different relationships with my parents purely because of how often they see them, but I make sure we video call, visit and talk about them so that they are not strangers.\n\nA few weeks ago I took my son to stay with my parents for a few days. We had a lovely time and when we were there my dad bought my son some toy cars.\n\nThe next day my sister came over with her boys and my mum called them into the living room saying \u201cboys follow me\u201d. Naturally my son followed.\nShe then gave my nephews a present each.\nMy little ones face was heartbreaking as he didn\u2019t understand why everyone got given a present but he didn\u2019t. I bent down and said to him \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go and get the cars grandma and grandad got you to show your cousins.\u201d I was trying to gently remind him that he had also been given a gift but it had been the day before.\n\nLater that evening I was talking with my mum and she bought up how my grandparents had treated us differently. I said looking back I can understand why we had a different relationship but at the time it was hard. I said that I know they will do more with my nephews, but that I\u2019d make sure my son understood he was just as important. I then took this opportunity (I wasn\u2019t previously planning on saying anything) to say that they (my parents) could help by not doing things that might appear to be treating them differently, such as giving my nephews presents in front of my son if there\u2019s nothing for him. He\u2019s 2 years old. He doesn\u2019t grasp the concept that he got something earlier. It\u2019s a bit like giving one kid one present and another 6. The total cost might be the same but kids will see one got more than the other.\n\nMy mum\u2019s response was that I am keeping track of who gets what and it\u2019s up to her what she does and who she buys gifts for.\n\nI think she\u2019s missing the point and my sister says I\u2019m TA for bringing it up,\nI hadn\u2019t planned to at all it\u2019s just how the conversation went.\nI don\u2019t want my son to feel like I did and will always make sure he feels equal to his cousins. \n\nAITA here? His face broke my heart and I thought I dealt with it well but now it feels like I\u2019ve created a massive issue.\n\n\nEdit 1 - following some of the comments I re-read my post and am adding things for clarity.\n\n1. The only reason I said anything is because my mum asked me directly \u201cwhat can we do to make sure \u201cx\u201d doesn\u2019t feel like we treat him differently?\u201d My response was \u201ctreat them the same - for example if you have something to give my nephews include him or don\u2019t give it in front of him\u201d\n\n2. It wasn\u2019t a birthday or other celebratory occasion. My mum saw something she thought one nephew would like and got something for the other so he wouldn\u2019t feel left out (her words)\n\n3. We all went to a train museum and I bought each of the boys a train as a treat. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I wouldn\u2019t do one without doing all three.\n\n4. My kid doesn\u2019t always get what he wants and yeah we deal with those melt downs and move on - just like any toddler.\n\n5. When we arrived at my parents I saw the things mum had bought on the side and thought it was something my nephews had left behind on a previous visit. \nWhen we were out I asked my dad to stop at a particular shop so I could get cough medicine. That\u2019s where my son saw the thing he liked and my dad got it for him. If we hadn\u2019t stopped he wouldn\u2019t have received anything during our visit. I don\u2019t have an issue with this as he probably already has too much stuff like most kids. It\u2019s the fact that my mum asked me how to she could make sure he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s treated differently, while treating them differently that confuses me.\n\n6. Yes I have issues and over think things. Dealing with this through therapy and will raise the points people have made. My wife is very good at bringing me back to reality. Note to self - don\u2019t do these trips without her!!!!\n\n7. Any parent hates to see their kid sad, but not only did he look sad he said he was naughty therefore making me think he thought he didn\u2019t get a gift because he was naughty in some way.", "created_utc": 1693299253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164d12x/aita_for_asking_my_mum_to_not_give_presents_to_my/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I want to gift something to a kid for any reason I make sure to do it when there are no other kids present.", "NTA you made a reasonable request to your mother.", "NTA. Especially after reading your additional edit about how your son only got his gift because you and your dad were in a shop and your son just so happened to find something he liked in there. Otherwise, there would\u2019ve been no present for your son at all and only for the other children. \n\nThis is incredibly rude and unfair of your mother. It gives the impression of favouritism for her nephews and, understandable makes your son feel left out. \n\nWho on earth gets all the kids together, buys gifts for all of them except one?! That\u2019s insane", "NTA, at 2 a kid has trouble understanding I got my gift yesterday, they get theirs today and they weren't even equivalent by the sounds of it.\n\nAs kids, I remember opening up a lot of Christmas gifts very early one year. My cousin was spending Christmas with us. While our shared grandparents gifted similarly to all of us- our non-shared grandparents didn't. My mom didn't want to create a situation where we kept opening more and more gifts while he just sat there. We were also older at that point where it would be understood, but for any kid that can uncomfortable at best.", "NTA. One of my Nana's treated me and my sister differently to my cousins. It didn't make sense as a kid, and it hurt. As we got older we didn't care and just didn't visit her much because she never had much interest in us anyway.", "NTA. I always knew my grandma didn\u2019t like us as much as her other grandkids. Everyone elses pictures were front and centre in her kitchen, ours nowhere to be found. Occasionally getting a gift for birthdays and christmas. Then seeing all the stuff she got for my cousins.\n\nYour mom said \u201dboys follow me\u201d and meant your nephews, not your son. Ofcourse he is gonna feel excluded!", ">I was trying to gently remind him that he had also been given a gift but it had been the day before.\n\nBut OP apparently forgot this by the time they got to the end of the post. OP: take a breath. \"It\u2019s a bit like giving one kid one present and another 6.\" No, it's not. I think you need to address your own (continuing) feelings of being \"less than\", rather than projecting them onto your 2 year old.\n\nGently, YTA.", "NAH - your mom didn\u2019t necessarily do anything wrong and it\u2019s valid that at his age your son wouldn\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t get something too so you were sad by his reaction. Sounds like you redirected fairly well and all was well. TBH, your mom probably could have just rewrapped a book or one of the cars and your son wouldn\u2019t really clock it, he probably just wanted to be a part of the opening process. \n\nIt\u2019s fair to request in the future that all kids be given the gifts at the same time or she gives you a heads up so you can already redirect. It does sound like you\u2019re overthinking/over analyzing a bit more than necessary so I think it\u2019s good that you\u2019re having the conversation with your parents. Seems like there\u2019s intentional effort on both sides to make sure things are as equal as possible.", "YTA \n\n\nSeeing other children get things (when they don't) is an important life lesson. \n\n\nYes, your child is only 2, but that's not too early to start teaching. \n\n\nThis isn't something thata going to cause trauma to your child and I'm sure they were over it pretty quickly. \n\n\nYou shouldn't be asking people to adjust reasonable behaviour to avoid a tantrum or upset. \n\n\nThis is how you end up with children who expect presents when they go to another child's party", "YTA. They had already given your kid a gift and not the others. It\u2019s not like they were just giving the other kids presents and not yours. I also think it\u2019s a good lesson to teach a child that they don\u2019t get a present just because someone else does. Again- the fact that your kid already got a gift just needs to be reinforced with your child, but your family is right. You are projecting your own issues and using it to try and control interactions when your parents were perfectly fair.", "YTA, your intentions were good but kids need to learn that sometimes they aren\u2019t going to get a gift.  If it\u2019s someone else\u2019s birthday or a graduation or something then they will get nothing.\n\nYour intentions were good but I think you are projecting your feelings in this situation.  Two year olds aren\u2019t that deep.  You absolutely did the right thing in reminding him that he had already received his gift.\n\nHistory doesn\u2019t have to repeat itself.  With FaceTime and regular visits your son will be able to build a relationship with his grandparents.", "***My little ones face was heartbreaking*** *as he didn\u2019t understand why everyone got given a present but he didn\u2019t* \n\nThe amount of times you people use such bs, portraying your kid as the ultimate victim of society is honestly so disgusting... *he was heartbroken*, *his crocodile tears were heartbreaking*, *his sad face was heartbreaking,* everything around you is heartbreaking, ohh the drama is too much. \n\nWell guess what, your job as a parent is to explain things to your kid so that he knows that the world does not revolve around him or his wants. Of course he did not understand why his cousins received a toy that particular day and he did not, but YOUR JOB was to explain to him the reasons why that happened and that was all. Your entitlement to ask you mother to not give gifts to her other grandkids in front of your little one was awful. YTA", "YTA. \n\nI have sisters who both have their own kids. I have none of my own. It gets so utterly tiring watching everyone keep score of who gets what and why. \n\nYou even said that your son got given a present before the nephews. Yes he was upset that he didn't get anything when they did, but it is your job as his parent to explain that he got a present earlier and to teach him that he won't get something every time someone else does. Otherwise, you're just setting him up to failure. You're also just going to alienate your own parents who will feel damned if they do and damned if they don't. Maybe your parents could have waited to give your son his present when nephews were there? But when and to whom they give presents is their choice.", "NTA for making the request. No harm in asking. If you start demanding things in their house then things change a bit. If your mom doesn't agree, your option is to not bring your son over to their place while the other kids are present.\n\nSeeing other children get gifts and not receive anything  himself is something that he will need to be exposed to and get used to at some point especially if he's going to attend his cousins for birthday parties since they live somewhat close. That is something to discuss with your SO how and when this exposure is done.", "NTA. I'd limit access if your parents keep being assholes. Your child's self-esteem is .ore important than having a toxic relationship with your parents.", "ETA\n\nYou are projecting - your parents aren't your grandparents.\n\nYour parents could be more sensitive to your feelings, especially since they know about your feelings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
