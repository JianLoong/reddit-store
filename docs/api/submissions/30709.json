My wife\u2019s two sisters, Jessica (36F) and Whitney (40F), their families, and my wife\u2019s parents (67F and 68M) all live within 20 minutes of each other, so we see everyone just about every week and are very close to all of them. \n\nTypically each holiday is hosted by the same family members each year \u2014 MIL/FIL host Christmas while Jessica and her immediately family host Thanksgiving. My wife\u2019s extended family also lives in the area and is typically invited to major holidays.\n\nThe relative in question is my MIL\u2019s cousin, Gemma (65F). Gemma lived her entire life with her parents until her mom passed 7 years ago, and now lives alone in the same home. Prior to her parents passing, Gemma had always been very overweight, but in the last 5-7 years, she has exceeded 400lbs (180lbs) and probably hasn\u2019t bathed in that time. \n\nClearly there are some deep-seated issues that extend beyond the weight and hygiene issues because over the years she has become very callous and bitter. She is nasty to everyone and orders people around like hired help, especially my wife for unknown reasons.\n\nThe largest problem is that Gemma absolutely reeks in the worst possible way. It\u2019s repsulive to a point where it\u2019s difficult to even think about eating when sitting next to her, which manifests in a large game of musical chairs every holiday dinner because no one wants to sit anywhere near her. Rooms and furniture smell awful for weeks after her visit.\n\nThis all came to a head last year when my wife and I finally decided we had had enough after my wife saw her holding our child (1M) with his fingers in her mouth. My wife and I didn\u2019t want to give any ultimatums, so after Christmas, we told my wife\u2019s immediate family that we\u2019d no longer be attending holidays with Gemma present.\n\nFast forward to this year, apparently everyone has conveniently forgotten about the prior discussion (and/or likely thought we wouldn\u2019t follow through), so it has created a lot of tension in the family.\n\nMy MIL is furious with my wife, saying that she (MIL) failed as a mother and can\u2019t believe she raised a daughter that would turn her back on family. I find this very ironic because, even after years of asking, MIL refuses to have a conversation with her cousin about hygiene and showering. The entire family just talks about how gross Gemma is behind her back and does not do anything to help her. \n\nJessica and her husband aren\u2019t speaking to my wife and I. Whitney and her husband believe we are doing the right thing. FIL understands but told my wife that we \u201care choosing to tear apart the family\u201d because we can\u2019t spend a couple hours with Gemma.\n\nI really thought we were making the responsible decision by not attending, but I do fully realize that Gemma is suffering from various issues and it may be cruel to just abandon her. I have no idea what other choice we could have made (besides sucking it up and making our two kids endure this for the holidays).

I offered to cut their toes nails once, almost gagged when the socks came off and said, no can't touch those, you need to see a doctor.  Eventually he went to the doctor and his feet were seen to.  But he did nothing about bathing.  There was always food about, but nothing I felt was safe to eat, so I would never eat or drink in their house, I imagine his immune system must have been superb to cope with what was going on.\n\nSome people let it get that bad.

Perhaps tell MIL if she isn't willing to have that awkward conversation about hygiene with Gemma, you or your wife will, or you won't be attending family gatherings with her.

Your baby takes precedence over Gemma even though I'm guessing Gemma can't help her issues and that's not her fault.", "About 10-ish years ago, I made a declaration that I was no longer participating in family gatherings on major holidays.  My reason was different...my sister always insisted on hosting and she invited her very rude friends.  In addition, she'd always invite friends for my nieces to play with during the day, leaving my son as the only boy, who was frequently an outcast in an all-girl's group of preteens.  Further, my sister would never budge on the time (2 pm), so that left me eating two meals ... one with my family and one with my inlaws... back-to-back.\n\nMy inlaws were just as complicated.  My MIL and FIL  hated the cartoons my son watched, so they wouldn't let him turn on the TV. On the few occasions I turned it on for him, someone (MIL, FIL, BILs, or SIL) would come in and turn the channel.  When he complained, they'd say, \"This isn't your house, you don't get a say on the TV.\"  Because he's the only grandchild on that side, this left him bored.  I'd let him bring his Gameboy, but they'd harp on that, too.\n\nI decided this wasn't healthy.  I told my family and my husband's that we would no longer be participating, and we were going to stay home, enjoy our holiday, and build our own family traditions and memories.  Leading up to the first year, my son was disappointed, but during that first holiday (Christmas), my son said, \"Mom, I really liked being at home today.  It was calm and I got to play with my Christmas presents.  Let's do this from now on.\"  \n\nI made a standing invitation for my inlaws and my family to join us whenever they liked, but I wasn't leaving my house!  We've since moved 5 states away, but at the time, this was the only way I saw to enjoy my holidays.\n\nNTA.  Stay home and create your own special holidays!!!  You aren't tearing the family apart, you are building traditions for YOUR family!", "I saw this same story, but with different names on here yesterday. YTA for doing that! What are you people hoping to achieve?", "This is a repost troll. YTA for wasting our time.", "I find the suggestion that she hasn't bathed in 5-7 years to be an unlikely assumption you are making.    That would cause health problems that require medical intervention and it makes it hard for me to hear that and not think you are exaggerating some other things.  You give us a weight but how could you possibly know that?  She doesn't bathe but supposedly weighs herself and shares that information?  You say she smells, so much so that chairs absorb the stench, but you're the only one who feels so strongly to lay down this new rule?  Not the hosts whose chairs are damaged beyond repair each year?  I'm sorry I just don't buy any of this.  \n\nBut you've decided you won't attend events she is also at, ok, focusing on that.  Have you said your goodbyes to her letting her know you'll essentially never see her again?  Or do you expect the family to let her know why you aren't at christmas?  Or what, do you expect your family to join you and leave her out so they can have holidays with you and your kid?  What exactly do you foresee for yourself and your family going forward?  Maybe your exaggerating, maybe the girl needs serious help, but anyway I look at it you are very literally responsible for creating a divide in your family and for that, YTA", "INFO: \"The entire family just talks about how gross Gemma is behind her back and does not do anything to help her.\"  \n\n\nWhat have you and your wife done to help her?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Babies are vulnerable, they don't know any better, and as they grow, they will put things into their mouths all the time.\n\nCold sores can kill babies if they're kissed by someone with it. If Gemma has infections on her skin and your baby gets infected, the baby can get really sick from it.\n\nThis is a hill to die on. Let people be mad at u and keep them away from your baby if they think your baby's safety and well being doesn't matter.\n\nLet them host Gemma.  Let them sit next to Gemma. Let them deal with Gemma.", "Oops some of your ableism slipped out while trying to reply, which unfortunately makes you TA.\n\nDisabled people have the right to live independently. Don\u2019t take my word for it- you can read about it in Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on Persons with Disabilities.\n\nhttps://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-19-living-independently-and-being-included-in-the-community.html", "If she smells that bad, she probably has massive skin infections already. And untreated diabetes. \n\nI had a dear friend who was massively overweight. Very sweet, but nearly spherical. Her diabetes was under treatment, but the persistent skin infections were what probably killed her in the end.", "I think you should seek a welfare check. I know it is not a pleasant thing to do, but most of her family actually don\u2019t seem to care about the health and wellbeing of this woman. Instead they prefer to ignore the issue for 99% of year and pretend they care for Christmas and Thanksgiving - faking family closeness.", "Doesn't seem like you have kids. Babies will just shove their hands places. I can't tell you how many times my son tried to shaddow box with my tonsils in the first year. The cousin may not have actively put its hand in her mouth.", "Or your Sister in-law, brother in-law, etc? \n\nOr have rhey Bern using you snd your wife as shields and make you guts sit next to Gemma so they don't have to?", "Honestly, I'm wondering if part of the bad smell IS that her skin has already become infected in places.\n\nNTA.\n\nOP is not 'tearing the family apart,' they are setting a boundary for themselves and their children.  Everyone else can just get over it and maybe get off their duffs and have that conversation with cousin Gemma.  It is LONG overdue.", "What is that? Just infections from being stationary for so long or lack of washing?", "Exactly", "I have kids. They don\u2019t shove their hands in people\u2019s mouths.", "She could be rotting in a way.\n\nPart of the \"old people smell\" is fat falling part. Poor hygiene can expedite the process, make it more present,  and/or make it worse. Add in sweat, skin oil, dirt, food, dead skin, etc, and you get a stinky cocktail.", "Both.  Not cleaning the skin folds.  Rubs against itself, gets irritated and infected, spreads, doesn't heal...  It's not good.", "I don't think in my friend's case it was either one. Very overweight people tend to develop areas of excessive skin folds. Diabetics can suffer from a multitude of other conditions, one of which is that infections which start in those folds are very slow to heal. She frequently spoke about the good care her husband took of her, changing her bandages and cleaning the wounds,, so it wasn't a case of lack of washing.", "Well lucky you mister my kids are functioning human beings.", "They are probably jealous that you guys are the first to say \"no\", which means that they \"can't\" lol. You guys setting a precedent means that others are going to realize they don't have to put up with it, until the musical chairs game ends and someone is stuck dealing with Gemma.\n\nWhere in actuality people should be stepping in and setting boundaries with her, checking in on her, getting APS involved, etc. (You guys really need to get adult protective services to check on her). I'd set the boundary not as excluding Gemma, but setting a boundary of hygiene.\n\nCongrats! You stopped trying to balance the rocking boat, and now they're about to capsize the thing and have to figure themselves out. (Often when people say to not rock the boat, they actually mean 'get back to keeping our rocking boat balanced for us')\n\nBest of luck!"]}
