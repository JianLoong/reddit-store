I said that\u2019s fine and he said to me he wants to choose my ring for me, I said ok to this too. \n\nThen what happened was that his mum said to him she will buy the engagement ring herself for me (my boyfriend lives in the UK and his parents live in another European country). I was not happy about this at first but then my boyfriend\u2019s mum is quite strict with him (he is 27) and doesn\u2019t like the fact that he chose his own spouse as she wanted to choose for him (we are from a south Asian background and she wanted my boyfriend and his wife to live with her after marriage).I\u2019m also 3 years older than my boyfriend which was a big issue for his mother (my boyfriend after several months persuaded his mother to accept me and she finally did).\n\nBack to the ring, my boyfriend said he will let his mum buy the ring and he goes to me what is the issue you\u2019re making a big deal out of this.

I was really upset and I said to him that you promised they will show it to me before purchasing it. He said he doesn\u2019t remember telling me this. Then I just stopped talking to him for a few hours because I was really upset. \n\nI then sent him a message telling him why I\u2019m upset and he didn\u2019t even acknowledge this message and kept telling me he loves me. \n\nThen at night I called him and mentioned the ring again and he says why am I making a big issue out of this he got me whatever he wanted to. I was already deeply upset by his response and I asked him has he even seen the ring and he said no. I cut the call and I balled my eyes out for hours and now I\u2019m sitting here writing this post.

Listen - how he is treating you now, is how he will treat you after marriage, only worse.  People mistakenly think that their boyfriend/girlfriend will change and treat them better after the wedding but that never happens.  So - if his behavior toward you now upsets you - and I would be hurt, disappointed and furious all at once - ask yourself if you want to deal with this treatment for the rest of your life?

You don't have to get engaged in a few weeks, you can step back and sort this out. \n\nNTA", "Girl do I need to fly across the fucking ocean to cover your living space in red flags for you to see all the issues that you are just ignoring?", "NTA. Your boyfriend is not listening to you. He doesn't understand why the ring is important to you. This could be a reflection of what he will think of the marriage. \nThis is all a bad sign. Please reconsider your relationship with him for your own happiness.", "Run, my friend, run! Run far away to Narnia.\n\nYou have a MIL and a mommy's boy problem. Which is the best wombo combo in any disastrous relationship.\n\nNTA but Y T A if you marry his mom.", "NTA ... unless you're having MIL hold hands and say vows with y'all up on the altar.", "NTA. The good news is you haven't said \"yes\" yet....", "SAVE YOURSELF!!! RUN!!", "Please go read r/justnomil to see what married life will be like.    \n\nPlease consider carefully.", "NTA \n\nBut kind of TA about not being happy with whatever cut is given. I might just have an odd way of thinking about it but I thought it was supposed to be symbolic and appreciated for it\u2019s symbolism.", "NTA. I enjoy having my mom around. But the cord has to be cut somewhere.", "You marry this boy and you will spend the rest of your young life posting stories about MIL on Reddit\u2026. NTA, but you would be if you hang around\u2026", "NTA: I know you come from a different culture, but if you\u2019re not living in the place that both of your families are from and have no intention of going back.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and do not marry a mama\u2019s boy. You can do so much better than that and deserve so much better than that.", "I married a man like that. It only ended in sadness and divorce.", "You should love yourself more though and have the self respect to walk away when someone treats you this poorly. This is going to be your future for the rest of your life, he\u2019s not going to grow a spine and change. Do you really want to continue bawling your eyes out, feeling unheard and heartbroken for the rest of your time? Sounds awful to me", "Famous last words before disaster. You have the chance to back away from this shitshow but you want front row VIP seats.\n\nYou are in this relationship with this guy and his mother.\n\nGood luck.", "MIL is doing this on purpose. She set a trap and he walked right into it. He showed he has respect for her and no respect for you.\n\nIf marriage was just about love the divorce rate would be a lot lower. At minimum you need love and respect for marriage.", "Love yourself more. You deserve better.", "Do you love him enough to ignore the obvious disrespect he has for you?", "You\u2019re in love with the idea of love.", "Loving someone doesn't mean you need to be with them. Victims of domestic violence may love their abuser, but they'd be better off without them. Love is not a reason to be with someone.", "You're allowing him to do this to you, you know that right? You're pushing back now but at the end of the day you're doing and saying things like this that give him no real consequences to his actions. What happens when his mom makes other choices for him? What happens when she tries to dictate how he helps raise any future children or makes any other financial decisions? Or given she already doesn't like you, doesn't think you're right for her son, she might try to plant seeds of distrust and drive a wedge between you two. A relationship is between two people and from the sound of it there's three in yours. You're not engaged to a man, you're engaged to a mama's boy. Watch 'I love a mama's boy' and if it doesn't feel like looking in the mirror then good luck because you're gonna need it.", ">Because he sure as hell won't feel the need to ever grow up after he's got you, if he didn't have to do it in order to get you.\n\nOP, please listen to this. My husband cites exactly this, that if I hadn't dumped him when we were teens, he probably never would have felt he needed to change, and we likely wouldn't be married now (we got back together over a decade after I broke things off). I was sure even back then that I wanted to be with him, but I needed to be respected in my relationship and at the time I certainly wasn't getting that. \n\nNow I didn't break up with him *thinking* that someday in the future I would get back together with him, of course, but him growing up and becoming a contributing, supportive partner is what made getting back together work.", "LOL he'll say whatever he wants now, but when those parents are coming you won't get any say whatsoever. Just like you didn't get a say with your ring. He's even said as much already when he told you that if they want to live with you he won't say no, and he *lied* to you about showing you the ring before it was bought.\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 \n\nThis is a whole bushel of red flags for how things are going to be in your marriage and it *isn't* going to get any better. Imagine if/when you have kids. His mother is going to be all over that and you will be pushed out of any and all decision making. Will you even be allowed to plan your own wedding? Choose your own dress? Why are you standing for this?\n\nGoing by some of your other comments I know you're not going to listen, (why did you even come here?) so congratulations on this being the rest of your life. Have fun with that. :/", "He also said that his mother would get your opinion on the ring before purchasing. You can\u2019t trust his judgment or his word when it comes to his mommy.", "Damn love really does make one blind to all the red flags in front of them. Exhibit A."]}
