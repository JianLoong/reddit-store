I apologized and offered to make them something else, but my friend declined and didn't want to eat anything else at the BBQ.\n\nThe rest of the night, my friend was visibly upset and didn't really engage with the group.

Then, *served it* to your friend, who by your account was the *only vegan* at a BBQ watching everyone else eating meat (and probably feeling repulsed), and allowed them to bite into it.

The way you describe it sounds like it was a mistake, for which you apologized and offered to try to make it right. It's not like you can un-prepare the burger.  I understand his being upset but if your apology was genuine, he should be able to move past it. As for \"not taking \\[their\\] choices seriously\", I'd say that making sure you had veggie burgers AND a separate grill for them shows you were trying.  Most people I know have one grill, so the veggie burgers would've had to be prepped some other way", "NTA.  It was a mistake and you apologized right away.  If you had done it on purpose or made it their fault you made the mixup then maybe an A but making a mistake and apologizing doesn't make you TA.

It was just a mistake.", "NTA. I'm personally vegetarian, raised in a household of a 10yr+ vegetarian. I NEVER assume that people will go out of their way to accommodate my personal lifestyle choices. If the parties or events that me and my mother go to have primarily meat eaters, we just eat before going.\n\n While the accidental meat biting is really unfortunate, situations where meat and meat substitutes get mixed up actually occur. There are also times where I order something vegetarian and end up getting something I don't want to consume. (I got bacon on my veggie burger at GetGo one time lol, ended up giving the bacon to my friend) The products that they come out with now make it even harder for us to differentiate. Between me and my mom, if one of us had to test something while eating out, I bite the bullet. Because the reality is, the animal is already dead. It's not the end of the world.

In a normal human that stops drinking milk after infancy, their body would stop producing lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose. Modern humans tend to keep this enzyme going for a while longer because we never stop consuming dairy. However, as you age it may naturally stop being produced, and your body will definitely stop wasting valuable resources making lactase if you stop consuming dairy for a long period of time. \n\nDid your wife's IBS symptoms stop or diminish when she went vegan though? That was how I read your last post. That's why I assume she has a sensitivity to something in meat. And yes, it would be experienced differently after a long break from eating something you're sensitive to... I have a lot of food allergies and sensitivities too and I definitely feel that the chronic symptoms when you consume the thing regularly feel more mild (but also more miserable overall lol) compared to the acute symptoms you get when you haven't had it in a long time and then try eating it again.  \n\nSo yes, I think eating dairy after a long time being vegan would make you feel like garbage, and you may never be able to drink milk again without taking a lactase supplement. And eating something you're sensitive to after a long time without it would make you feel like garbage-- and heck, any sudden diet changes will probably make you feel weird. I personally never experienced even mild stomach aches from eating meat though, after 23 years as a vegetarian, and that was from infancy.", "YTA\nYou imply that you knew you made a mistake and served the meat anyway.
