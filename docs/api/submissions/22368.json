{"id": 22368, "submission_id": "150rqkf", "title": "AITA - Cancelling Our Wedding", "selftext": "We are a couple (M and W) who have been happily engaged for the last year and due to get married in 1 year's time with a large cultural wedding in M's hometown, away from where we are currently based. The wedding was funded by M's parents with deposits paid.\n\nIn the midst of planning, we were suddenly told by M's parents that M's elder brother and girlfriend has decided to get married 3 months before us in the same location. This of course came to us as a shock and we wondered what the rush was as the girlfriend was definitely not pregnant. This felt difficult as the entire decision-making process of M's elder brother's wedding being so close in date proximity to our wedding was made without our consideration.\n\nWe had a conversation with M's parents and elder brother and expressed our disappointment at the lack of communication and consideration for our feelings. This led to multiple disagreements and in particular, we were told that we were unreasonable for not being happy that M's elder brother was getting married. M's parents explained that we just had to accept it and move on. Apart from that, the presence of M's elder brother's wedding would mean that any planning for our wedding would have to be on hold until their wedding was done with.\n\nFor context, M's elder brother's girlfriend has been desperate at the idea of getting married. Ever since we were engaged, she has been pressuring M's elder brother into getting married with not-so-subtle actions (flashing her ring fingers constantly and directly asking M's elder brother about getting married, even during our engagement celebration). Most of her friends are recently engaged or married and she has expressed the need to get married due to massive FOMO.\n\nWe have always been supportive of M's elder brother and girlfriend. We often host them when they are in town. Once we were engaged, M's elder brother's girlfriend frequently asked about our wedding ideas and W would tell her everything. Subsequently, our ideas were used as their own. This included having a registration meal in a restaurant we go to each year for our anniversary. The disagreements led to further passive-aggressive texts from M's elder brother's girlfriend to W, upsetting her.\n\nFast forward a few months, M's elder brother and his girlfriend have decided to postpone their wedding until after ours \"to make us happy\". They recently decided to get engaged 3 days before our own engagement date anniversary. Their wedding ceremony is now a few months after ours and they have decided to use the same wedding planner and the same vendors from our wedding.\n\nTo date, no one has reached out to either of us to apologize or even acknowledge that their decisions and actions have hurt us. This has made us continually upset and we are therefore thinking of not undertaking this large wedding ceremony of ours but know that this will very likely cause anger with M's parents and probably will lead to animosity long-term.\n\nAITA/Are We The Assholes?", "created_utc": 1689467214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150rqkf/aita_cancelling_our_wedding/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now you have what you wanted.

Cancelling sounds like an irrational ahole decision.", "Definitely tacky of them to copy so much of what you are using for your own wedding, but don\u2019t let it ruin yours. Especially since they moved it until after your wedding I think a lot of people that you both know are going to notice they copied a lot from you.

You\u2019re free to have the wedding you want before they have a wedding.", "NTA, their behavior is super narcissistic. It's a classic manipulation tactic, do something extremely unreasonable then \"compromise\" by doing something that's less unreasonable but still unreasonable, like imagine if someone stole $10 from you, then compromised by giving you $5 of your money back, and then everyone expected you to forgive them because they were *so generous* to give you $5. It's a similar situation here. They're still trying to divert attention from your wedding to theirs, but because they have changed the date the parents (by the way it's obvious who the golden child is between M and M's brother) are probably expecting M to be completely fine with everything.\n\n**Edit to add:** I'm seeing Y T A votes which I actually can't understand. Yes, they're technically allowed to have their wedding when they want to, but it's blatantly obvious based on this part \n\n> M's parents explained that we just had to accept it and move on. Apart from that, the presence of M's elder brother's wedding would mean that any planning for our wedding would have to be on hold until their wedding was done with.\n\nthat there is massive favoritism going on here. If any planning for OP's wedding has to go on hold until the brother's wedding, that means they're essentially saying that all planning that requires extended family input (which is going to be a lot, if I'm right about what culture this is) will have to go on hold until *three months* before the wedding. That is NOT enough time. \n\nIt's like people didn't even read the post and just said \"You can't get mad at someone for when they schedule the wedding\" when it's clear that M's brother is doing a *lot* of things to intentionally try to take the spotlight away from M and W, and M's parents are not only accepting of this, but actively telling M and W that they have to be happy for him.\n\nThis is a \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes\" situation in my opinion, and if they lose their money it's on them for playing favorites. Also, you bet your ass if OP cancels their wedding they're just going to make that the brother's wedding instead (this might honestly be their plan, I would not be surprised).", "YTA, you don't get to book half a year of everybody's time for your wedding. 3 months is a perfectly reasonable time between two weddings to plan yours.", "YTA", "ESH. Three months is far enough apart that there should not have been an issue, so you are wrong for getting upset. They are wrong for copying your plans.", "NTA. You set your wedding date first. The brother sounds exhausting. That being said, you did all this setup so why cancel it? Yes the family you're looking at marrying into sounds like a lot of work but why give your future BIL the satisfaction?", "NTA, it's your life. The important thing is to start your life with your spouse in a way that you both agree on and feel good about. But if you decide to cancel the large wedding just be prepared for the consequences.", "NTA\n\nIf you do keep the wedding date as scheduled, maybe make some significant changes and don't discuss those changes with anyone.", "NTA - I had something similiar happen.  My partner and I had been together for nearly three years when we started planning our wedding.  His younger brother met a girl at the fundamentalist church they both attended and because they couldn't sleep together without getting married, they rushed to the altar in just a few months from meeting, setting their wedding two weeks before ours.  Cramming in front of us that way meant that members of my husband's family who had planned to travel to our wedding could not manage to do two trips that close together so they didn't come.  I've always kind of resented that.  I will say that my MIL was not happy about what they did, this was all on them, but their selfishness was not appreciated.", "NTA, change, cancel, do it, don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s just a fucking wedding and it\u2019s yours. Do as you please with it. I\u2019m sorry but the whole wedding thing is really out of touch with current life, people forget the true reason of a wedding and will spend well out of their means (or use their parent\u2019s hard earned resources). My wife and I got married on the ocean, on our boards with a few friends and family members. It took a few hours over a few days to set up, no stress very little costs and a vibrant memory to keep (plus we caught some fat waves after) and bought a house with all that money we didn\u2019t spend on bullshit.", "ESH. You get a wedding day, not months. Your post makes it sound like you\u2019re very entitled. 3 months before your wedding day isn\u2019t the end of the world. It could definitely be way worse, especially since they have now postponed for after your wedding. I\u2019m assuming their rush of a wedding was very largely due to the girlfriend and wanting to be in the spotlight. It\u2019s of shitty of her/them to steal/copy your ideas but it clearly shows that she jealous. Using the same venue and wedding planner doesn\u2019t seem like a huge deal to me. \n\nI think YWBTA if you go and cancel everything now. There will be a loss of money for M\u2019s parents for the deposits they have won\u2019t be refunded for. All the time & efforts that has been put into planning would be all for nothing. There will also be negative consequences if you cancel as well. Is it really worth ruining your relationship with your STB in-laws? You\u2019re being a bit dramatic but that\u2019s not to say that your feelings aren\u2019t justified, because they are. But canceling everything now would be childish and unnecessary \n\nThe best think you could do and get off your chest your feelings about this all the them, and move on. Keep your wedding day and plans as they are. But stop telling either of them anymore of your plans and ideas.", "NTA\n\nAnd I would be really hard-pressed not to run off and elope. \n\nScrew them all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
