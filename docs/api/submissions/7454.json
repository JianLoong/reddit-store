Absolutely NTA. It seems like he just wanted to have home cooked meals and wanted to make you do all the work.", "**NTA** for being angry enough to throw out all that food, but **YTA** for doing it. You\u2019re not being the AH *to your husband*, you\u2019re just an AH for wasting all that food and the time/effort it took you to make it. Since your husband decided he wanted no involvement in cooking and didn\u2019t respect you enough to stick around on a day you had already planned to cook together, he of course didn\u2019t deserve that food. But you did, and you should\u2019ve saved it for yourself.\n\nYou definitely need to have a conversation with him because outside of the food issue, he totally disrespected you and the plans you made together. That\u2019s a problem on it\u2019s own, regardless of context, and it doesn\u2019t even sound like he\u2019s sorry.", "ESH. I totally get your anger! But that was such a waste of food.", "INFO: Was the purpose of these home cooked meals to be getting their benefits, such as being healthier, cheaper, and arguably tastier, or was the reason to have an activity you two can participate in together? Because, potential assholes or not aside, it sounds like you two may have had different ideas of what the resolution meant.", "Petty and wasteful? Yup.\n\nUnderstandable? Yep.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, he was super rude, I wouldn\u2019t want him having any of the food either", "ESH - His rudeness is obvious but what did you gain from throwing perfectly good food in the trash? That was petulant and childish.", "ESH. Yiiiiiiiiiiikes - either this story is just the surface of a shitty-relationship iceberg, or you both have a LOT of growing up to do. This is not how adults communicate or react. Do better, get a divorce or live in misery with each other - these are the choices. \n\nAnd not making a choice is still making a choice.", "NTA. \n\nDo you think it was a plan on his part - get you to do all the cooking, then he can come home and eat?  Or was he just horribly inconsiderate and selfish?\n\nEither way, it's a shame you lost the food, but I totally understand not wanting him to have it. He definitely doesn't deserve a home-cooked meal, and he has no right to get mad at you.", "If you wanted to cook together and he didn't show up in time to start it why didn't you just wait till the next day to cook it instead of making the food by yourself just to get mad and throw it in the dumpster", "ESH - he is the asshole for his actions, but throwing away the food was self defeating.", "ESH. You two have waaaay bigger issues than dinner.", "ESH.\n\nHe should not have stayed out so long with his buddies, so he could be sober enough to drive home and help you cook. Understandable this would be frustrating.\n\nYou shouldn't have thrown out a perfectly good chicken and sides that would've lasted a few days, just because you were mad at him. If you called when he had been drinking, would you want him to drive home drunk and try to cook drunk? Now what are you going to do about meals?\n\nNext time you want to cook together, he needs to stay home and do chores before dinner if he can't be trusted to get home on time.", "NTA.  I'm an old man who was super dumb when I was young, and I totally pulled shit like your husband did to you.\n\nI like to say that when I was 25 I was a total idiot, and now that I am 52, I am still an idiot, but not a *total* idiot.\n\nYou need to get through to your husband that he was wrong.  Sometimes that means throwing the whole meal away.  Sometimes grand gestures are what is required to make an impact.\n\nI would have eaten some of it first, though.  :)\n\nThankfully, my wife of 27 years is a saint (the \"take no bullshit\" type of saint) and is still with me.  She would have done the same as you in that situation.  And had harsh words with me when I got home.", "NTA\n\nYou are not his cook.   He planned this as something you would do together.   \n\nIf you didn't throw it out would he actually realize how angry you were with him?\n\nI do think you should have at least eaten your portion and thrown his out.", "ESH. Throwing out all the food is an extreme and immature reaction. I think you should see making home cooked meals as also something you do for yourself and your health. But what he did was awful. You two have a lot to work through.", "ESH- however throwing the food into the trash was a childish reaction.\n\nYou have the right to be upset but that was not necessary.", "ESH. Wasting all of that food was pretty pointless, but it sounds like the two of you have serious issues with respecting each other and being petty that you should work out. Resentment is toxic in relationships.", "Definitely NTA. I would have done the same.", "The thought behind what you both \u201cwanted\u201d is admirable, it\u2019s healthy a choice and you spend time together.\n\nWhat he did was really wrong and immature, it was disrespectful of you. \n\nBut wasting food is terrible and spite gets you no where. \n\nESH", "Huh. People are getting very precious about food for one meal. She didn\u2019t throw out the entire fridge. NTA. He hung up on you? I\u2019d be incandescent. Unless you routinely destroy things in anger, I\u2019d say your actions were justified.\n\nDoes he do this often?", "ESH. He stayed out all night, leaving you to cook by yourself, and you wasted all the food just to spite him. If he had wanted to be gone all night, he should not have promised to come home in time to help. He's absolutely an asshole for his portion. At the same time, what does throwing the food away accomplish for anyone? Sure, it's cathartic, but if this going to be a large enough meal to provide several meals throughout the week, you would have had to throw away a pretty decent amount of food.", "ESH - Jeez, obviously he should've committed to help make dinner instead of pawning it off on you but i don't really see how you throwing away everything in a fit to be good?? Like theres no reason to do that?? Maybe I'm just not getting it??\n\nYou are the lesser AH in this scenario though, and Husband should probably wise up instead of point fingers imo", "YTA- just cook and eat the food yourself. That was a childish move.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWasting food is an absolute heartbreak. He was selfish to bail and you should have just packed the damn food away.", "ESH\n\nYou both need marriage counseling on how to communicate with each other and how to be mature adults. Throwing away all that food in anger was a very immature and wasteful thing to do. To think of all the hungry people who would have been so thankful for just a few bites. You also cheated yourself out of the leftovers. \n\nYes, he was being an AH but you managed to lower yourself to his level. Happy now?", "INFO: was there an argument/conversation that happened as the result of this? How did you/he react when everyone realized what happened. I feel like we are missing something here.", "ESH - I understand your anger, and I think you know already that you reacted poorly.  You both need couples therapy that is above Reddit's ability to help with. Step 1 - get therapy to help you both better communicate and support each other.  Step 2 - ease yourselves into cooking. Maybe try a subscription box like Hello Fresh.  Good luck.", "ESH.\n\nThere are bigger issues here than throwing out one meal. If this was something you had planned together and he blew it off, then he has disrespected you. But if your reaction was to throw everything out in anger, then it implies this wasn't a one-time thing, but rather, you have been feeling some kind of imbalance for a while.\n\nThis whole incident sounds like it was a proxy for real communication, which is why ESH. Sit down and have a conversation about your relationship, your priorities, and how each of you feels about the importance of things you plan together.", "Esh - he lied, you wasted food.", "YTA for throwing food away. Theres no justification for wasting food.", "YBTA, him for obvious reasons.\nYou for taking food for granted and throwing it away.", "YTA for throwing out perfectly good food. Why couldn't you eat it and leave his to go cold on a plate? \n\nHe's an AH for bailing and you're N-T-A for being upset he bailed though.", "YTA. I don't blame you for being mad, but wasting all that food was just ridiculous.", "ESH \n\n\nJFC, next time just don't let him eat it. Don't waste EVERYTHING because someone doesn't show up.
