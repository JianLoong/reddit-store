You\u2019re not being the AH *to your husband*, you\u2019re just an AH for wasting all that food and the time/effort it took you to make it.

Understandable this would be frustrating.\n\nYou shouldn't have thrown out a perfectly good chicken and sides that would've lasted a few days, just because you were mad at him. If you called when he had been drinking, would you want him to drive home drunk and try to cook drunk?

At the same time, what does throwing the food away accomplish for anyone? Sure, it's cathartic, but if this going to be a large enough meal to provide several meals throughout the week, you would have had to throw away a pretty decent amount of food.", "ESH - Jeez, obviously he should've committed to help make dinner instead of pawning it off on you but i don't really see how you throwing away everything in a fit to be good??
