Racist little asshole sounds like he needs some help and perspective. Soft YTA for bringing up dead dads to a kid who's clearly not dealing well. I think you know what you should feel bad about and what you shouldn't. I'm sorry for all the bullshit he said, if it makes you feel better I'm guessing his life isn't very happy and he's lashing out at the world because of it.  Being a teenager fucking sucks man, it gets a lot better later.", "ESH but it\u2019s almost justified in your case. He had it coming but a low blow is a low blow", "ESH - I agree with everyone else; while he sounds like a jerk, his lack of father figure may be at the root of his problems. \nHe definitely deserved the blow but it was also unnecessary on your part as you could have ignored him or told the teacher.", "Take  it  from  someone  who  deals  with  this a lot , I understand.  The best  way to combat  racism  isn't  with  more hate but with gentleness when possible.  People like  this have reached  an astounding  level  of  sheer stupidity.   Was what  you  said  mean? Absolutely.   Was it understandable  why you said  it? Definitely.  So I'm gonna  say a very  soft ESH.  I had a racist in my class too.", "Esh.", "ESH.", "ESH. Mild on you, more on the racist.   \n\n\nIt seems like Dan isn't dealing well with his dad's death, so he's being an AH and a racist one at that. I wouldn't expect you to say anything else to him, but someone should tell him that whatever he's going through with that is valid, but him saying racist shit to you and others is unacceptable and there are other avenues to find a way to cope. Again, that's not on you to tell him that, but somebody definitely should.", "Maybe I'm just to old to get it \ud83d\ude06 but I don't understand why people get so upset over words. Yeah, this kid was def TA and from what OP has described, everyone already knows so the only thing this accomplished was making OP sound like TA too.

You're not even mad?! I was like no, they're right. \n\nNTA\n\nI'm so tired of reporting this behavior and calling parents and nothing happening. Sometimes the only way to stop someone is to go low.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a teacher and this is how I hoped a student would shut it down (if I hadn\u2019t already). You didn\u2019t fight him, and you didn\u2019t actually insult him either when you used your words. You just said \u201cDead Dad?\u201d.

If she made racist remarks back then would that have gotten the bully to shut up and stop bullying her? No it wouldn't.

I literally said he was a jerk, and the point is to not sink low just because he was low.", "She could get in huge trouble for that. A student recorded a video of their teacher using slurs but wasnt the person who posted it. She got suspended.", "There is no line. The bully wasn't being fair so OP doesn't have to be fair. OP got the bully to shut up which is all that matters. If the bully didn't want his feelings hurt then maybe he shouldn't go around bullying other people.", "But it wasn't low. It was enough.", "\n>Where did I justify what he did?\n\n\n>He can\u2019t help that he has no father.", "Do you understand logic? That\u2019s me NOT justifying what OP did. If you read my comment again, it says he deserves a clap back. Saying he doesn\u2019t deserve that comment about his dead father doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t deserve ANYTHING."]}
