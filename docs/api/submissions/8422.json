I've been heartbroken, but also very angry as I feel her care for the initial treatment was very lacking. It was reproductive cancer in her late 20s, she went through chemotherapy and other treatments (she didn't like to go into detail, so I don't know a huge amount here) but was refused a hysterectomy b/c she was \"so young\" despite asking for one. We both moved across the country from each other and didn't have a ton of contact aside from \"keeping up\" messages until her cancer came out of remission. I don't know how quickly it happened, but it spread to other organs and she told me that she was terminal. Jane was NC with her family, for good reason, so I said I'd be her family and we spent a lot of time together her last month virtually through discord watching movies, listening to music, chatting, playing games, just things to keep her distracted a bit. Her friend/roommate helped take care of her physically at home until she passed and then handled her estate. \n\nSo now at present, her friend/former roommate reached out to me recently and said that he was planning an anniversary memorial for her and wanted to make it a regular thing. I personally can't stand the idea, but I didn't say anything negative, just that I can't travel but gave condolences that he is still feeling her death so hard. Jane was very independent, could not stand upsetting others and when she was dying told me that she hated how it was her fault people were upset. I honestly can't see her being on board with something like this, she didn't even want to have a memorial immediately after her passing. He agreed to her face but after she passed he arranged one anyway and invited family that she'd previously been NC with. I'm aware that I'm still very angry about how she died, and wonder if I'm not seeing things clearly.

Death is hard and you have to be open and honest about it.  You also recognize that Jane's death was hard on her roommate as well and he has to do what he needs to do.  It would be fine to call him up and explain how you actually feel as long as you don't shame him for needing to grief in his way.  The fact that he is involving people that Jane was NC is odd but who knows what his reasons for that are.  It's not what I would do in his place but I can't say for sure it is wrong.\n\nIt may have been a few years ago but I still sorry for  your loss.", "NTA Im sure the roommate thought he had good intentions but what he really did was put his desires for a memorial over Janes end of life wishes and invited people she never would have wanted to be there. Kudos to him for taking care of her and handling the estate but he really botched the memorial service and youre right to decline and honor your friend the way she wanted.", "Hard one. I lean towards NAH.\n\nI get your point of view, but memorials are for the living - we don't get to choose how someone else grieves for us, and if this is something that will help them I think they should do it. \n\nHe was the asshole for inviting NC family (although there's a lot of variables to that and it's complicated, I'm assuming these people wanted to mourn her despite being NC?), but otherwise if he wants to honour her memory each year that's his prerogative and it's not your place to tell him how to do that.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "YWBTA. Memorials are for the living, not for the dead. You are probably right about how your deceased friend would feel about the matter, but she is no longer directly involved. Some people have a deeper need for in-person, public displays of grief, and I think telling them not to do so would be in poor taste.", "NAH. It might be they don\u2019t know the context, but be kind because this is about the living left behind and maybe this is a part of closure for the former friend? Let them know your side but be prepared to politely decline and be ignored. :/", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
