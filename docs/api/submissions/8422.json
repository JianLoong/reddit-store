I've been heartbroken, but also very angry as I feel her care for the initial treatment was very lacking. It was reproductive cancer in her late 20s, she went through chemotherapy and other treatments (she didn't like to go into detail, so I don't know a huge amount here) but was refused a hysterectomy b/c she was \"so young\" despite asking for one. We both moved across the country from each other and didn't have a ton of contact aside from \"keeping up\" messages until her cancer came out of remission. I don't know how quickly it happened, but it spread to other organs and she told me that she was terminal. Jane was NC with her family, for good reason, so I said I'd be her family and we spent a lot of time together her last month virtually through discord watching movies, listening to music, chatting, playing games, just things to keep her distracted a bit. Her friend/roommate helped take care of her physically at home until she passed and then handled her estate. \n\nSo now at present, her friend/former roommate reached out to me recently and said that he was planning an anniversary memorial for her and wanted to make it a regular thing. I personally can't stand the idea, but I didn't say anything negative, just that I can't travel but gave condolences that he is still feeling her death so hard. Jane was very independent, could not stand upsetting others and when she was dying told me that she hated how it was her fault people were upset. I honestly can't see her being on board with something like this, she didn't even want to have a memorial immediately after her passing. He agreed to her face but after she passed he arranged one anyway and invited family that she'd previously been NC with. I'm aware that I'm still very angry about how she died, and wonder if I'm not seeing things clearly.

Death is hard and you have to be open and honest about it.  You also recognize that Jane's death was hard on her roommate as well and he has to do what he needs to do.  It would be fine to call him up and explain how you actually feel as long as you don't shame him for needing to grief in his way.  The fact that he is involving people that Jane was NC is odd but who knows what his reasons for that are.  It's not what I would do in his place but I can't say for sure it is wrong.\n\nIt may have been a few years ago but I still sorry for  your loss.", "NTA Im sure the roommate thought he had good intentions but what he really did was put his desires for a memorial over Janes end of life wishes and invited people she never would have wanted to be there. Kudos to him for taking care of her and handling the estate but he really botched the memorial service and youre right to decline and honor your friend the way she wanted.", "Hard one. I lean towards NAH.\n\nI get your point of view, but memorials are for the living - we don't get to choose how someone else grieves for us, and if this is something that will help them I think they should do it. \n\nHe was the asshole for inviting NC family (although there's a lot of variables to that and it's complicated, I'm assuming these people wanted to mourn her despite being NC?), but otherwise if he wants to honour her memory each year that's his prerogative and it's not your place to tell him how to do that.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "YWBTA. Memorials are for the living, not for the dead. You are probably right about how your deceased friend would feel about the matter, but she is no longer directly involved. Some people have a deeper need for in-person, public displays of grief, and I think telling them not to do so would be in poor taste.", "NAH. It might be they don\u2019t know the context, but be kind because this is about the living left behind and maybe this is a part of closure for the former friend? Let them know your side but be prepared to politely decline and be ignored. :/", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he wants to plan a memorial and see if others want to attend, he should do that. At this point, you\u2019re probably better off to decline to attend.  If you are asked why, tell people that she told you she didn\u2019t want a memorial.  But wait to see if anyone asks for your reasons.", "I\u2019m very sorry for your loss, the pain and anger it put and puts you through.\n\nYWBTA if you did this, however you are not the A for feeling the way you do.\n\nRituals for the dead are actually as much for the living and if one of the closest person to Jane, that accompanied her through the end of her life, wants to do this, it\u2019s his right, his own way of mourning. It is your right to not want to be involved but you cannot tell him what he sould and shouldn\u2019t do.", "YWBTA\n\nMemorials are for the living, to process grief and emotions. Let them do what they feel they need to do. You don't have to participate.\n\nI lost a close friend to a car crash. Some of the friend group visit his grave and have a beer on the anniversary of his passing, some don't. It's a personal choice.\n\nIt's not like he's starting a war in her name or making some big thing she would have been upset about. He's just remembering her and grieving as a group with similar minded people.", "Look, you don\u2019t have to *go*. Your friend is dead and the people she left behind mourn in different and personal ways. You don\u2019t have to participate or agree or even *care*. Just leave them to it. \n\nNTA unless you tell them you disagree and want to argue about it. What good can come of that?", "NTA it sounds like he is making his grief about himself instead of about her memory.", "Since he handled her estate he may have developed civil relationships with them", "NAH\n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your friend. \n\nIt is perfectly understandable why you don't want to participate. Neither do you need to give your opinion on why you decline the invite. Jane is gone. She can't be offended. Let it go. The anger regarding Jane's medical care is not on him.", "NAH. You lost someone, and it is heartbreaking to read that she was denied a hysterectomy that might have stopped the cancer. You seem to react with (understandable) anger. They seem to react with the (understandable) wish to keep the memories alive. Can you just agree to grief differently and therefore better not together?", "NAH. But post-life celebrations are really for the living, not the deceased. This is her roommate's way of grieving her after going through a massive trauma himself (end of life care is incredibly traumatic, even in the best circumstances, which clearly this wasn't). \n\nA celebration of her life that becomes a regular part of your life will be hard the first few years, but after a few years of processing, can become a place where the people who loved Jane the most can get together to tell stories about her, remember her, and be with other people who loved and miss her too. \n\nJane wouldn't want people to be sad over her, but too bad - she should have been a worse person if she didn't want people to mourn her. But avoiding a celebration of life doesn't make people less sad about her, and giving people a place and time to mourn helps in the long run. \n\nI think you know your circumstances best, but I'd really suggest you reconsider what this will mean to Jane's roommate and you.", "NTA\n\nMeh, don't contact them just don't go.\n\nThey hold a memorial for my best friend for 10 years almost now. I went for the first two and had to stop because the only people who show are drifters with false memories or people who'd done him so badly I can't stand to look at their faces. Unfortunately his memorial became a virtue signaling fest for the hopeless acquaintances his powerful personality had impressed.\n\nGood luck and continue to move on in life. The dead have.", "YWNTA for not participating in the memorial for your friend. Especially since you live across the country.", "NAH. People grieve in different ways. He\u2019s allowed to have annual memorials for her and you\u2019re allowed to step back from that.", "NAH\n\nGrief is hard, and while Jane may have asked for no memorial, we should remember that some people need these events to work through their grief. So you are definitely entitled to follow her wishes and refuse the service. But I don't think it was 'wrong' of them to hold a memorial service simply because the people Jane left behind wanted to remember her.", "NTA\n\nShe had specific wishes, and the roommate continues to ignore them. You can remind him that this isn't something she wanted, but at the end of the day, all you can do is refuse to participate. We all handle grief in our own way, and perhaps this memorialization helps him in some way.  I'm sorry that your friend's final wishes aren't being considered, though.", "Everybody grieves in their own way.\n\nI would simply go no contact and leave it at that. It is not like you are in the same social circles or anything.\n\nNta"]}
