As i do most of the cooking, at home, she asked me to be in charge of food and drinks. She was in charge of cleaning the house and entertainment.\n\nI asked her what she wanted me to make she said said a cold buffet would be perfect. I then asked her if any of her friend had any dietary restriction, veganism or anything that i should know. She told me no, that i could make anything i wanted.\n\nSo i planned a charcuterie board, a cheese board, a few tray of cut crust sandwhich, veggie platter, deviled egg, shrimp crown, pasta salads, Chips and dips. Classic things. I\u00a0decided to also make a big pot of vegetable soup in case the guest wanted something hot on a cold winter night.\n\nI went shopping and when i came back, my girlfriend helped me unpack. I bought lots of food, enough for 20 people. Looking at what i had bought, my girlfriend looked at me and said \"What will Karen (fake name, 28F) eat? So i pointed at the groceries with a puzzled look, and she said \"Yeah, she wont like any of this.\"\n\nI laughed and said \"She dont like cold cut, veggies, cheese... soup?\" She answered \"She dont like veggies, she like cheez-whiz, not brie, She like canned ham\" So i tried to compromise. \" I can ground some ham, brine it, press it and vaccum cook it... I will make some sandwhich, with fresh homemade bread, deviled eggs, there will be chips and dips\" She shaked her head \"She dont like homemade bread or eggs and probably wont try homemade canned ham\" At that point i became a bit peeved and said \"I cant make a buffet based on one person pickyness... What should i make her?\" My girlfriend answered \"You know, simple stuff. Pizza roll, chicken nuggets, chicken wings, pigs in blanket.\" My reply was \"So... not a cold buffet.\" She said \"Yeah... but you have to understand, she was traumatized by her aunt that forced her to eat thing she didnt like\" My reply was \"Thats not a trauma, thats every children. My mother made me eat boiled liver,  boiled broccoli, boiled brussel sprout. If i didnt finish my plate at dinner, she wrapped it and served it to me as breakfast the next morning, you cant cater to a child food tantrum everyday.
