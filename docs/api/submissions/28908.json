Does your son enjoy spending time with her?", "NTA.\n\nYou have a court-ordered agreement, you 100% are not an AH for keeping to it and letting her know you will not deviate unless it's an emergency.\n\nAdditionally, you may be able to end this: if your son is now 12 or 13, there's a very good chance depending on where you live, where you can go to the judge about custody and your son can pick where they want to live full-time.  Sounds like he'd prefer you and your wife, not your ex, so that would really solve it if you can go that route.  Ask him how he feels about it though, it's got to be something he actually wants.", "NTA, but you should focus on what's best for your son. Not to be the bigger person, but just to make sure his life at his mom's isn't made worse. If these favors don't impact him, go ahead and refuse to do them. And even if they did, you would still be well within your rights to do so. Just keep the more important piece in mind :)", "By me telling her \u201cno, I won\u2019t switch or accommodate your schedule\u201d make me the AH?", "NTA, but in the end, whatever you choose to do should always, if possible, be what is best for your son.  You cannot be expected to accommodate your ex's whims unless it works out okay for you and is in the best interests of your child.  You certainly do not owe her favors, but you don't want your son hurt in anyway you can prevent.  \n\nAs for the BF talking badly about you, that is something that will NOT earn him any points with your son.  That's pretty low class too, I'd say.", "NTA per se, but how does your son feel about each change? At 13, he's old enough to start having some input on changes to his schedule.", "NTA. Don't let him control you.  You have done well so far but you need to work on your pent up resentment before you blow.  As to your ex, if you can accommodate her do so. If not, tell her no.  Don't look behind the door of why she does it. Assess each ask as objectively as possible.", "NTA\n\nI coparent long distance with my ex. The way they're handling things sucks but you know what? It's not about me, it's about my kid. The second she turns 18 I don't have to deal with them anymore.\n\nYour ex decided what the circumstances would be like when she chose to have this other person as a partner. Also what that guy is doing may be legally Parental Alienation; look into it.", "I will go against the grain a little bit here because it sounds to me like these favors aren\u2019t necessarily inconveniencing you but you just want to say no out of spite.

Don\u2019t switch days, unless for actual emergencies. With drop offs stick with what is convenient for you, if her request happens to be more convenient for you as well go for it, if it\u2019s well out of your way or inconvenient to you say no. Obviously other varieties of requests would also be a best judgment, like something for kido is an okay, something simply for her is a no.

I would be accommodating only when is it for your son's benefit. The ex and her clown aren't your problem. \n\nJust keep doing the right thing by not talking about them in front of your son and be exceedingly polite when turning them down. Saying, \"I'm sorry, that change doesn't work for us,\" is clear, concise and polite.

Additionally your days are yours, you never have to change them if you don't want to, so you're never TA for saying no.", "He\u2019s doesn\u2019t like it but goes along to not cause issues. He knows she\u2019ll give him a guilt trip or get in trouble if he speaks up.", "I suppose one day he'll aproach you with a will to stay at your place permanently. Same happened to my cousin when he got 10 y.o. His mother's current bf is pretty much of a dick, so most of the time he stays with his father (not the best parent either). I wait for him to grow a little older so he could ask me for help himself if needed", "That's a tough spot for him to be in. If he doesn't want to switch, then tell her no and tell him to tell her it wasn't up to him and that he didn't have a choice (technically true, since it is actually your decision, not his). She should not be guilt tripping him for things he has no control over."]}
