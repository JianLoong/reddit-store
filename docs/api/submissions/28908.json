Does your son enjoy spending time with her?", "NTA.\n\nYou have a court-ordered agreement, you 100% are not an AH for keeping to it and letting her know you will not deviate unless it's an emergency.\n\nAdditionally, you may be able to end this: if your son is now 12 or 13, there's a very good chance depending on where you live, where you can go to the judge about custody and your son can pick where they want to live full-time.  Sounds like he'd prefer you and your wife, not your ex, so that would really solve it if you can go that route.  Ask him how he feels about it though, it's got to be something he actually wants.", "NTA, but you should focus on what's best for your son. Not to be the bigger person, but just to make sure his life at his mom's isn't made worse. If these favors don't impact him, go ahead and refuse to do them.

You cannot be expected to accommodate your ex's whims unless it works out okay for you and is in the best interests of your child.  You certainly do not owe her favors, but you don't want your son hurt in anyway you can prevent.  \n\nAs for the BF talking badly about you, that is something that will NOT earn him any points with your son.  That's pretty low class too, I'd say.", "NTA per se, but how does your son feel about each change? At 13, he's old enough to start having some input on changes to his schedule.", "NTA. Don't let him control you.  You have done well so far but you need to work on your pent up resentment before you blow.  As to your ex, if you can accommodate her do so. If not, tell her no.  Don't look behind the door of why she does it. Assess each ask as objectively as possible.", "NTA\n\nI coparent long distance with my ex. The way they're handling things sucks but you know what?

Stick to the legal agreement unless a true emergency occurs.", "NTA. The parenting plan exists for a reason. \n\nSimply state that you will be following the parenting plan as written and then don\u2019t deviate.", "NTA. I\u2019d suggest a case by case sort of deal. Don\u2019t switch days, unless for actual emergencies. With drop offs stick with what is convenient for you, if her request happens to be more convenient for you as well go for it, if it\u2019s well out of your way or inconvenient to you say no. Obviously other varieties of requests would also be a best judgment, like something for kido is an okay, something simply for her is a no. So I would suggest not just being an automatic no to everything, but also don\u2019t feel afraid to or bad about saying no.", "This is the way!!!", "He does but he prefers it here.", "NTA. I would be accommodating only when is it for your son's benefit. The ex and her clown aren't your problem. \n\nJust keep doing the right thing by not talking about them in front of your son and be exceedingly polite when turning them down. Saying, \"I'm sorry, that change doesn't work for us,\" is clear, concise and polite. If she wants to start demanding to know why, just tell her that you don't owe her any explanations and l you don't really have time to get into a prolonged conversation with her in that moment.", "Those comments are called parental alienation. Mark them on your calendar, what was said to your son, on your phone. Can be used later to back up your son if he says he wants to live with you.", "Please get and use only a co-parenting app to communicate with your ex. Additionally your days are yours, you never have to change them if you don't want to, so you're never TA for saying no.", "He\u2019s doesn\u2019t like it but goes along to not cause issues. He knows she\u2019ll give him a guilt trip or get in trouble if he speaks up.", "I suppose one day he'll aproach you with a will to stay at your place permanently. Same happened to my cousin when he got 10 y.o. His mother's current bf is pretty much of a dick, so most of the time he stays with his father (not the best parent either). I wait for him to grow a little older so he could ask me for help himself if needed", "That's a tough spot for him to be in. If he doesn't want to switch, then tell her no and tell him to tell her it wasn't up to him and that he didn't have a choice (technically true, since it is actually your decision, not his). She should not be guilt tripping him for things he has no control over.", "You are not the a-hole!", "NTA\n\nMy father sounds like your wife and her new hubby combined when it came to my parents' divorce. My father did everything he could to make us hate our mom (which almost worked when we were young) and would also make things difficult whenever he could (asking for a different day/switching days, needing different pick up/drop off locations, etc). He did everything he could to make my mom's life more difficult. He hated her and for seemingly no reason. It caused my brother and I a lot of trauma and issues. If she continues to violate court orders/argue against them, take her back and get full custody with MAYBE supervised visitation with her. She is causing an unhealthy and unhappy situation for your son. He shouldn't have to \"just go along with it.\" If needed, tell your wife due to you being the primary caretaker of your son, that she and her husband are not allowed to punish him. Or at least her husband. This will give him more freedom to stand up for himself and argue in his own favor.", "NTA. Tell them to quit with the games. It\u2019s a power play. I don\u2019t know much about custody laws, but talking to your lawyer about problems caused by a step parent might be worth a shot.", "You got full custody because the courts deemed you fit to make decisions in your sons best interest. They gave you a schedule that worked best for what you felt was best for your son, accommodating your ex wasn\u2019t in your sons best interest. \n\nSo, if your son isn\u2019t liking the switching, and is being guilted be his scapegoat, let him blame it on you, until he feels comfortable to stand up to his mom. Give him your full support and until he is ready to use his voice, be his voice. Tell her no, don\u2019t switch days, because from comments it doesn\u2019t seem like that is in your sons best interest, and remember to use word, that stares it\u2019s not in our sons best interest to switch dates at this time\u2026 it\u2019s not in his best interest to change the pick up/drop off location this time around\u2026 \n\nNTA, but be an AH who only cares about how it affects your son and not her. Talk to him before agreeing, and only if he truly is okay with it do it. Otherwise, don\u2019t let things change, and anytime she doesn\u2019t show, if it\u2019s a pattern, you can use that to take time away from her. \n\nBest of luck!", "NTA.  Both your ex and the current partner sound like massive jerks who really and obviously deserve no favours and do deserve huge amounts of scorn.", "Nta. Stick to the judge decisions. You're totally in the right  if you say no", "NTA but try and do things in a way that would be in your sons best interest. For example, something may come up where you son wants to stay a little late at his mothers because of a birthday party for a friend. Be understanding and do not drag him away to prove a point.", "So, your child is paying a price for the teo of you having a bad marriage and a bad divorce?\n\nYTA.", "NTA, \n\nYou will be enabling your ex and her rude partner, if you did cave in and do favors.\n\nNo need to be rude to ex when you say no or explain why you are saying no.", "NTA she tried forcing you out of your sons life so he can be inserted as dad.\n\nAre you documenting all this?", "NTA, but don't make it a automatic no. \n\nThe key thing here is to show your child healthy conflict resolution.", "NTA. They've learned they can get away with their behavior BECAUSE you've accommodated. Establish boundaries.", "NTA I assume your agreement is legal and part of your divorce decree. Hence, thems the rules. You don\u2019t need to adjust them.", "I think I would also add that her partner has caused problems by butting in, and until he quits his comments and opinions, you aren't all that tempted to be helpful.", "NTA OP it's past time for you to attach strings to each of her requests, just like she does to you. She's had it too easy and needs to have to do something for you to justify you doing something for her. Plan out a few things for her to have to do for you to help her out. \"If X wasn't such an AH I'd do this, but since he is here's what has to happen for me to help you out this time.\"  \n\nI'm petty enough to say to place the blame directly on the AH, but you may want to start off just saying if you want this then I need you to do X in return. Just stop making it so easy on her, let her be inconvienced a few times and my bet is you'll get fewer requests from her.", "No.  Tell her you are willing to take him that day, but in no way are you switching.  You will still have him when you are supposed to.  Her schedule issue problem is just that.  HER problem.  Unless it's an absolute real emergency.  \nYes, you and your wife are taking the high road, but don't let her or her clown walk on your road.", "What is best for your son? Yeah, she is nothing nice, but will changing your behavior negatively impact your son?", "No, you are NTA.", "NTA. Your son needs predicability, all this messing around isn't good for him. He needs to know in advance where he will be and when, he's probably using a lot of mental energy dealing with all of this. What happens with his homework, textbooks or gym kit, if he can't trust where he will be and when? Does he just have to constantly move that stuff between houses? What if he wants to make plans with a friend, how does he know where he'll be in two weeks time or which parent to even ask for permission?\n\n\nThis arrangement isn't about you or your ex, it's about your kid and his feelings have to be the main focus.", "Thank you!", "Why do someone a favor who can\u2019t even stop their spouse from shit talking her child\u2019s father in front of the kid? She can\u2019t be bothered to go out of her way, he shouldn\u2019t bother to go out of his. He said in another comment his son doesn\u2019t like the changes the mom makes but goes along to get along. Someone\u2019s gotta be parent here. It\u2019s obvious that\u2019s not her.", "Frankly OP sounds like a saint here.\n\nI sure as hell wouldn\u2019t be doing any favors for the woman who allows her new boyfriend to badmouth me in front of my kid and then proceeds to defend him for it.", "Then you need to be the one to say no. Take it entirely out of his hands, so there's no point in her trying to manipulate him. Protect your kid, even if it's from his mother. NTA", "Yeah how much you do or don't like her fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to be related to whether or not you can switch or do pickup somewhere else.", "I do because I don\u2019t want him getting the 3rd degree. Plus I know if I put him in the middle, I\u2019m no better than her and he won\u2019t be comfortable coming to me with these things."]}
