When my nephew was about 5 he told me he felt like his siblings didn't like him very much, and that didn't call him their brother. He heard them tell another kid that he was not their brother. He was upset about it because he didn't understand why they'd say that. I told my sister and at the time she didn't seem to care very much. She said my nephew was fine and her stepkids loved him and all three kids were close. She said I was overthinking what he told me. I didn't really know what else to do so I let it drop. But my nephew continued opening up to me. In the last five years he has vented, cried on my shoulder and told me he doesn't think his half siblings love him. He only truly realized they were half siblings when he was about 7 and a friend of his explained he had a half sister because his mom had a baby with someone who was not his dad and he came to realize his siblings had a different mom.\n\nMy nephew hates that his siblings don't want more to do with him.

I told him not to push them but he could always ask if they want to watch a movie or play on the trampoline and I told him if they say no, he needs to accept their no.\n\nI did tell my nephew he should talk to his parents about it but he said they didn't care. After asking him some questions I realized they didn't see the whole picture or at least the picture my nephew saw. At least they didn't until the 15 year old did a genealogy protect for school and didn't include my nephew at all. This led to some questions being asked, the older kids saying they only acknowledged one sibling and my sister and her husband talking to my nephew who said how he felt. He also told my sister he spoke to me.\n\nShe was furious with me. I pointed out I had come to her and she dismissed it. She said I should have done it again and kept trying to make her understand. I said if I had done that she would have accused me of getting involved in something that was none of my business. She admitted she would have but my nephew would have been better off.

Your sister is an A H who desperately wanted to blend families and didn\u2019t care about her son or his feelings. \n\nNTA", "Give your nephew an extra big hug the next time you see him.", "Maybe not enough for the nephew to keep on going to the uncle for a shoulder to cry on. Patrick cannot make much assumptions we can only take what is given but still I still count Opie's sister as the ah", "Yeah I agree she's the AH", "Imagine telling someone about a mine field and they blow it off as if they never plan on driving to where it is. Then they do and blow up. You told them so they knew but they didn\u2019t accept the reality of it. NTA, she is trying to wedge you into a catch-22 situation, don\u2019t let her. If you got on the war path to get this in her thick head, you\u2019d been the bad guy and double down as there was nothing wrong. Long term, he\u2019d suffer more.", "NTA. I hope she attempts to shake up her children.", "Uh un. No way this is somehow your fault. Its her life and you already offered her your sincere perspective and unique vantage point. She doesn't get to blame you for failing to respond to her own child's spoken unhappiness.\n\n NTA. Your sister should focus on the fix and stop blaming and shaming over this one.", "NTA. You tried ot tell her. Shame on her for not being open to her own son's pain", "You told her that there was a problem. That your nephew's half-siblings didn't want a relationship with them.  You tried to get her involved... and she blew you off.  She admits that she would have accused you fo getting involved in something that wasn't your business... you did everything that yould reasonably have been expected of you as an aunt.  You tried... and your sister and BiL blew it. \nAnd now... your sister wants to blame You for THEIR failings has parents.  Totally unfair, and untrue. You did your best, and they can't blame you now.  You're NTA.  It's time for them to accept that they failed as parents.", "NTA. He tried and she didn\u2019t care. You cared so he continually opened up to you. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. \n\n\nThis is all on his parents. She should have addressed it the first time you told her.", "NTA\n\nYou already tried more than once. Continuing would have just caused your sister to become irate. She even admitted so herself.\n\nI don't truly believe that she blames you. She probably feels immense guilt and is looking for anyone to blame while she's trying to process this all. So try not to take her complaints to heart right now.", "Apparently he DID try to tell her, as he said they don't care. She already dismissed his feelings at least once and enough times for him to give up. She just wants to blame someone for her neglect.", "NTA you did tell her, you encouraged him to speak out and he was not listened to, they only finally woke up when the older child did somthing so blatant they couldn't ignore it, they are trying to find someone other than themselves to blame.", "NTA it's very much a damned if you do damned if you don't scenario. At least your nephew had you the whole time as your ear and support would have been invaluable", "NTA, and idk what your sister is going on about now. You both told her and she ignored you both. She lives in that house, she saw it all day to day. There\u2019s no way she could have lived there and been blind to it all. She either didn\u2019t care or was turning a blind eye the whole time. So I\u2019m confused as to why all of the sudden it\u2019s different now.", "NTA.  I'm youngest of 3 and don't talk to either of my siblings b/c they treated me like this growing up.  My parents still can't hear, understand, or relate to that pain, so I don't talk to them much either anymore.\nLet your sister know she can either except her shitty parenting, learn from it, and do better or she probably won't have a son when he gets out on his own.", "NTA \n\nIf someone told me only once that my kid felt unhappy about something I cannot even imagine to brush it off! \n\nIt says a lot that your nephew trusted you more than his own mother. Hopefully she sees it now and will do better for her son, but she\u2019s the one that effed up. Also, if your nephew told you that in confidence, image how he\u2019d feel if he found out you told his mom without his knowledge?", "I told my younger sister, \"If you fall down, I will always help you get back up. But, you aren't even about to blame me for you falling down. That's not OK.\"", "Yeah, you're right. If the step kids were seeing their dad and half Brother every weekend here in there instead of 50-50 custody, then yeah, I could see how the parents could miss the disconnect. \n\nEven so, this situation is so depressing. Me and my brother and I have an almost 3 year age gap, and we're still as close as ever, and that's thanks to our parents.", "NTA she's just putting the blame on you because she just found out she's not the best parent", "NTA.  You could not win in this situation - as you said, if you kept telling her what he was telling you, she would have told you to butt out of their lives and stop interfering, possibly even cut your contact with your nephew.  Only when she saw actual proof of how the half-siblings felt did she get upset, and by then your information was just confirmation of what she already knew.  As they say, she FAFO and now she wants to pass the blame.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister feels guilty for not listening to her child to begin with and instead of dealing with it she\u2019s redirecting it all to you.\n\nBtw, i had to read the first few sentences of your post an embarrassing number of times, my brain was not braining very well.", "I call fake. This is just a flipped around version of several other recent posts.\n\nYTA for posting it.", "You know bad parents exist, right?\n\nOur stepdad didn\u2019t do anything about us fighting with his son until he tried to strangle my older sister.", "> Five years, and OP's sister and her husband never saw how disconnected the kids were with one another?\n\nGuess you have never been around narcissistic parents.", "At the ages the kids are a 3-year gap and a 5-year gap are huge differences.\n\nHis half-siblings are in high school -- he's still in elementary school. They aren't going to have a lot in common. Add the fact that there's likely a divorce so the kids don't actually live together and that gap gets even bigger.\n\nI wonder if LW's sister was her now-husband's side-piece.", "\"I ignored my child time after time and then when I was finally forced with evidence I shifted blame to the only person that's been listening to him\"\nSis needs to put on her big girl panties and admit she's been failing her kids by looking at them with rose colored glasses.", "The only AHs are the boys mom and dad who pretty much ignored him when he tried to reach out and blew you off the first time. Don't let her gaslight you....this is on them, they need to own up to their neglect.", "You did try to involve her! It\u2019s not your fault that you didn\u2019t bug her and bug her until she figured it out! She\u2019s a huge a-hole and you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t want to hear it.  You told her. Just be a good aunt to your nephew, and let him know that he can come to you.", "Unless of course you pushed her lol /s ....little sibling humor. My brother is 6 years older then me and we were not close at all, but I knew if I needed some protection he would always be there if I needed him. Never realized he actually cared/loved me until he told me he was given his daughter my name for her middle name. I don't cry but he damn near broke me lol.", "It's a tough situation, push too hard one way, and the older kids will resent her as well,  completely icing out any relationship for either of them. But yeah, when a kid comes to uncle for help because mommy and daddy don't care,  someone fucked up.", "NTA\n\nYour sister was in denial. Now instead of accepting the truth, she is looking for people to blame", "NTA - your sister and her husband abdicated parenting and now she is looking to blame you for their mess. I am glad your nephew had you to turn to. I imagine that his half-siblings' behavior is because they see him as a representation of the breakup of their family even though that isn't fair and there has been no therapy. Meanwhile their dad (and maybe their mom) has pretended like they aren't hurting. Sad for all the kids.", "NTA Why is she blaming you? She didn't listen to HER son. She saw what she wanted to see and she refused to see this. This is on her and her husband.", "NTA. The boy\u2019s got shitty parents and now one of them is trying desperately to shift the blame. You did all you could do.", "NTA\n\nShe is literally holding you responsible for herself.\n\nShe feels guilty and its easier to blame someone else then accept it in full.", "NTA. Your sister is desperate to blame anyone but herself.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou did try to involve her. She chose to ignore you. She didn't investigate it then. Why should you believe she would if you brought it up again? She and BIL are assholes for not paying attention. The older children didn't all of a sudden not want anything to do w/half-sibling. \n\nI have children from separate fathers. They don't consider themselves 1/2s. They are full siblings in their hearts. They've said as much. They said it when they were young also.", "NTA. You did tell her. She blew you off. She fucked up big as a mom and she doesn't get to pass the blame for her failure off to you.\n\nYour nephew is lucky to have you in his life.", "This. She's embarrassed and guilty, and perhaps she doesn't have a lot of emotional maturity, so she's lashing out at OP.\n\n\"YOU DIDN'T TELL ME!\"\n\n\"I did tell you.\"\n\n\"YOU DIDN'T TELL ME HARD ENOUGH!\""]}
