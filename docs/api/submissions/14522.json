{"id": 14522, "submission_id": "12if0hx", "title": "AITA for not trying to tell my sister again what my nephew aka her son was telling me?", "selftext": "My nephew is 10. He's my sister's only child. But she has two stepkids ages 15 and 16. My sister's stepkids are my nephew's half siblings. They share a father. My sister's stepkids have an active mom in their lives and split time between their mom's house and BIL and my sister's house. When my nephew was about 5 he told me he felt like his siblings didn't like him very much, and that didn't call him their brother. He heard them tell another kid that he was not their brother. He was upset about it because he didn't understand why they'd say that. I told my sister and at the time she didn't seem to care very much. She said my nephew was fine and her stepkids loved him and all three kids were close. She said I was overthinking what he told me. I didn't really know what else to do so I let it drop. But my nephew continued opening up to me. In the last five years he has vented, cried on my shoulder and told me he doesn't think his half siblings love him. He only truly realized they were half siblings when he was about 7 and a friend of his explained he had a half sister because his mom had a baby with someone who was not his dad and he came to realize his siblings had a different mom.\n\nMy nephew hates that his siblings don't want more to do with him. He longs to be closer. He asked me for help on how. I told him not to push them but he could always ask if they want to watch a movie or play on the trampoline and I told him if they say no, he needs to accept their no.\n\nI did tell my nephew he should talk to his parents about it but he said they didn't care. After asking him some questions I realized they didn't see the whole picture or at least the picture my nephew saw. At least they didn't until the 15 year old did a genealogy protect for school and didn't include my nephew at all. This led to some questions being asked, the older kids saying they only acknowledged one sibling and my sister and her husband talking to my nephew who said how he felt. He also told my sister he spoke to me.\n\nShe was furious with me. I pointed out I had come to her and she dismissed it. She said I should have done it again and kept trying to make her understand. I said if I had done that she would have accused me of getting involved in something that was none of my business. She admitted she would have but my nephew would have been better off. She told me he is *her son* and she should be told when he is feeling like that. She asked me how she was meant to feel hearing her son say he didn't think he was loved or wanted. She told me I should have involved her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681207485, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12if0hx/aita_for_not_trying_to_tell_my_sister_again_what/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds to me that your sister feels SO GUILTY that she's desperate to share the blame. \n\nYou're right that there's nothing you could have done without risking your sister reacting negatively, and ultimately jeopardizing your relationship with your nephew. \n\nYour sister needs to own that she f.ed up and SHE needs to listen better -- people don't need to try to make her hear.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou tried telling your sister what was going on and she didn't wanna hear it. And now that she's finally figured it out on her own, she's trying to retroactively blame you for her own poor parenting skills.", "NTA\n\nYou tried more than once.\n\nShe is using you to mitigate her own guilt and try to stay on her high horse. Don't let her.\n\nHE told her. YOU told her. Both of you, more than once. WHAT MORE DID SHE WANT, GOD HIMSELF TO MAKE SOMEONE PUT IT IN SKYWRITING? She'd STILL say it was a prank and keep dismissing it.", "NTA...you DID try, and your sister disregarded your concerns. You've been there for your nephew and that's what's truly important.", "I'm going to go with NTA. \n\nConsidering her previous reaction and the close relationship you have with your nephew, if you'd kept helping on the issue, I'd have been worried about being cut off from him. \n\nWith almost every other AITA post, when someone keeps nagging about something, they're deemed the A H.", "NTA - You DID involve her. She then dismissed you and her son's concerns for years, and now she feels guilty and is using you to scapegoat her guilt. \n\nShe should have dealt with the problem when it was first coming to light instead of letting it fester for years, but she was in the honeymoon phase with her new husband and saw how you presented her son's concerns (which I'm sure he must have mentioned to them before you how he felt as well) as an inconvenience to her otherwise happy experience.\n\nThis is on her entirely, but she will never accept that.", "NTA\n\nit's her responsibility to make sure her child is ok and if she couldn't see it at the time it's not your fault. the audacity to blame you for this, I think she's feeling guilty and trying to lash out at you. the fact that he came to you instead of his mom speaks volumes, she probably just dismisses him.", "NTA.  You told her.  Forever after is all on her.", "NTA.  You tried to tell her, she didn't want to hear it and now you off..  She was a shitty parent and now wants to try and blame you instead of accepting responsibility for hey own mistakes.", "NTA. You tried. Sounds like your nephew tried too, but \"they don't care.\" Give your nephew an extra big hug the next time you see him.", "NTA as a Mom with a 4 yr old. If a family member told me this the LAST thing I would do is invalidate his concern. Regardless how small i feel his issue is, at that age hes just learning his voice.\nHe is lucky to have someone like you, if he had no one most likely would have accepted his voice doesnt matter to ppl and bottled everything up.\nThat being said my best advice going forward is to say that you are respecting the childs boundries with talking about things when they are ready. That if she is upset by it she needs to make herself trusted enough by him to share concerns.", "NTA. She's just feeling guilty.", "NTA and no asshole to be seen here.

What you left unsaid in that conversation is that continuing to tell your sister something she should have known anyway might have negatively affected your relationship with her, and therefore, with your nephew.  If she's this determined to make this whole thing someone else's fault, who's to say she wouldn't have limited your access to him?  For trying to cause unnecessary problems, or some nonsense like that?  This is not on you, OP.  You did try to share your nephew's feelings and your own concerns.  Sister Person just doesn't want to shoulder the guilt alone.  NTA.", "I imagine that she should feel sad that her son was suffering, disappointed that she hasn\u2019t fostered a trusting enough relationship with him for him to have the same conversations with her that he has with you, and grateful that he has a trusted adult in his life in whom he can safely confide. but it sounds like she thinks she should feel mad, which i think is an understandable self defense mechanism, if not the most helpful choice/response.\n\nI do think that over the course of many years you could have gently broached the subject at least once or twice more, maybe by asking questions father than making statements, but you know better than I if that would have lead to positive or negative outcomes.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep being that person for him.

She sounds like she's more embarrassed that now her husband also knows how awful her son feels and that she dismissed you warning her.

You called it in your explanation.\n\nAnd at the risk of being callous, if your sister is so upset over something like this even after you tried to help her, you were better off for the sake of your own relationship not telling her and avoiding her being furious at you for more years of your relationship."]}
