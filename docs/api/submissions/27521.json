{"id": 27521, "submission_id": "16qsjs2", "title": "AITA for not giving my nephew half of my inheritane from my parents", "selftext": "Ok some backstory my brother got a girl pregnant basically right out of highschool and was disowned by my parents because he wanted to stay in the kids life instead of just paying monthly child support and going no contact. This lead to him dropping out of college and working full time to help support his girl friend and his future kid. So recently my parents have decided to retire and move to the Bahamas and they both left their companies to me which are worth a good chunk of change since I was already working for them. Anyway recently my nephew and his mom found out about this and inquired if they left their nephew anything.\n\nI told them that my parents didn't want anything to do with her or her kid and didnt leave her anything(My brother passed away 5 years ago).  I thought that was all that was there to it but she asked me if I would give her kid my brothers half of the inheritance. Some more context my parents didn't want my brother to have anything since believe he could make good decisions as the head of a company. I told her this and I assumed that was it since she left. Unfortunately a few days later she's been pestering me about \"doing the right thing and giving the kid his share of his grandparents wealth\" and has basically been being a massive nuisance.  \n\n\nedit for clarity-  Its not legally inheritence i just called it that because thats basically what they did transferred the assets id get when the died to me a bit early since I dont know any other similar term", "created_utc": 1695544716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qsjs2/aita_for_not_giving_my_nephew_half_of_my/", "score": 4000, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is there something about your nephew\u2019s mother that your parents don\u2019t like? Their reactions seem excessive. \n\nYour parents are horrible people and absolutely are assholes in this situation. Disowning their son for not being a deadbeat was bad enough. But refusing to have a relationship with their grandson after their son died is even worse.", "INFO:Your parents have retired, not died, so how can there be any inheritance?", "NTA. Your parents are still alive, if your nephew has a problem with what he's getting,he can talk to them about it.", "NTA. Your parents are for wanting your brother to abandon his son, but that's a separate story. Your brother, prior to his death, was the one responsible for creating a will/ estate for his child. That being said, the money your parents gave you is yours to do with. Do you have a relationship with the girlfriend, or did she just turn up out of the blue with her hand out? Would your brother want you to help provide *something* for his child? If so, determine what amount or % you feel is appropriate. You aren't obligated to half. Perhaps create a trust to contribute towards his college or a down payment for his future home?", "I see two different judgements here. \n\nFirst, your parents. They get the ah award. Your brother took responsibility and did the right thing and took care of his son and his girlfriend. Disowning him and their grandson was morally repugnant. From what you described, it appears they will continue on this path until they pass. \n\nSecond, you. At this point, your parents assets are now your assets. What you said to your brother\u2019s partner is your parents position. What is your position?  You are not bound by your parents actions. You get to make your own decision. What do you want to do?  Turn your back on your nephew or make provisions?  What was your relationship with your brother? What do you believe he would want you to do?  This is something you need to reflect upon. Then act according to your conscience. I can\u2019t really give an honest judgement here. But you owe it to yourself to come to your own mind about this.", "Your parents are the assholes here for not  acknowledging their grandchild and trying to make their son reject his child.\n\nNow you are following in their footsteps.\n\nI don't think I'd give her half, but I think any decent person would want their nephew to grow up without being in poverty and want a relationship with their dead siblings child. \n\nMaybe you could pay a monthly amount for child support?", "NTA. But I almost want to say everyone sucks here.\n\nI see her point of view and think your parents sound extremely cold in shunning their grandchild. If anything, it seems like a discussion she should be having with your parents/her child's grandparents. I realize the companies have already been transferred to you, but that was your parents' choice, not yours. And it's not like your brother would have inherited from you anyway. If she wants to convince your family to 'do the right thing' in her view by providing some kind of financial assistance for your nephew now that your brother has passed, that's still a discussion for your parents.\n\nYou and/or your parents contributing to a college fund for your nephew doesn't seem totally unreasonable to me if you are in a financially stable situation.", "So... because your brother stepped up and took care of and loved the child he created, your parents disowned and disinherited him. And now you're following their terrible example and refusing your nephew and his mother money they could certainly use, since your brother is dead. \n\nAre you a family of cartoon villains? FFS.

There's no guarantee anyone gets a share of anyone's wealth after death, and in your case you earned it by working for both companies.

You cut ties, you cut all ties. \n\nSo yeah, they are not entitled to your and your parents money, but if you were close with your brother, maybe you can set something like a college fund for your nephew.

You\u2019ve followed in your parents point of view, I honestly don\u2019t understand how you could share this view. \n\nYou\u2019ve been handed a job and now a company, I\u2019m not saying you should give half but yes you should give something, a helping hand, a job, something.", "NTA\n\nTell her to wind her neck in.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even understand what you or they are supposed to do here, since your parents are still alive.  Sell some of the business to give him money? Give him an ownership interest in the business so he can partake in the profit? This seems highly irregular to me, and illogical.  I understand that they struggled, but this almost seems like they are trying to get whatever they can from your parents who have some money.  They have kept away until now, but I honestly do not see how you taking over the business logistically (or legally) changes anything. This is not some milestone moment where your parents are passing around wealth to everybody - they wanted to retire, you were already running the business, so they just more formally solidified your role. \n\nAlso, grandchildren do not normally inherit anything until grandparents pass. Wealth is generally passed on when one generation ceases to exist. And ultimately, depending on where you live, even your own brother may not have had a legal claim to their wealth.\nPlease also seek out a lawyer to see what your options are. \n\nOne thing to consider - even if you are legally not obligated, would you consider giving them something? For instance, monthly support, or a trust fund? I don\u2019t think your parents handled this well at all, and while he has no right, this is not something out of the ordinary that rich grandparents would do for their grandkids, or a rich aunt/uncle for their nephew/niece.  This might even be a good point to broach the subject of just having a proper relationship, especially as your brother is no longer around. Something to think of, especially because your parents\u2019 actions surely left some justifiable bitterness.", "NTA\nIt's their assets and they choose what to do with it.

Your brother is dead, your parents have exited the picture and you seem to be okay with carrying their unreasonable attitude into another generation.   \n\nYour brother's widow and his child aren't entitled to what is now yours.   They are entitled to some sort of acknowledgement that your parents did your brother wrong.   The problem I see here is that her demand for half of what is now yours is just wrong.  Was your brother able to send his son to college?  Does the child have any outsized debt due to the loss of his father?

This lead to him dropping out of college and working full time to help support his girl friend and his future kid. So recently my parents have decided to retire and move to the Bahamas and they both left their companies to me which are worth a good chunk of change since I was already working for them. Anyway recently my nephew and his mom found out about this and inquired if they left their nephew anything.\n\nI told them that my parents didn't want anything to do with her or her kid and didnt leave her anything(My brother passed away 5 years ago).  I thought that was all that was there to it but she asked me if I would give her kid my brothers half of the inheritance. Some more context my parents didn't want my brother to have anything since believe he could make good decisions as the head of a company. I told her this and I assumed that was it since she left. Unfortunately a few days later she's been pestering me about \"doing the right thing and giving the kid his share of his grandparents wealth\" and has basically been being a massive nuisance.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
