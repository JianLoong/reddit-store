We both have kids from previous relationships.  I have 2 kids (10M & 8M) and she has 2 kids (19F & 15M).  My wife's oldest, Kate, still lives with us while attending community college and working part-time.  Like many 19-year-olds, when she isn't in class or working, she's very active on social media.  This has caused some issues however.\n\nMy kids' mom and I have had an agreement that we aren't going to give our kids phones until they are 13.  It's something we've agreed on for a long time and I don't intend on changing that.  Of course, this has caused some issues because my wife's kids both have phones, but they are older.  My kids are well aware of the rule their mother and I have about giving them phones.  They don't like it, but they're young and their mother and I don't feel they need phones of their own yet.\n\nKate posts a lot on Tik Tok and Instagram.  Whenever she makes videos of her dancing or something, my kids want to join in.  But, I don't feel comfortable with them being on social media.  They are too young to consent to something like that on their own and they don't fully understand that the internet is forever.  I've told Kate many times that I don't want her to include my sons in any of her social media content.  No videos, no pictures, nothing.  \n\nHowever, she does not listen.  I've caught her many times taking videos of my kids eating gross stuff or doing stupid things for a laugh.  When I tell her to stop, I am met with lines of \"You're not my parent\" or \"They said they wanted to do it.\"  Of course they said they want to do it, they're 8 & 10 and they look up to you, Kate.  My wife has talked with Kate about it too, but nothing changes.\n\nThe most recent time I caught Kate filming them, she had mixed a bunch of food into bowls and had them eat it.  I sent my kids to their rooms and had some words with Kate.  I told her that we've talked about this many times and she refuses to respect my boundaries regarding my kids.  I told her that this is her last warning and if she does it again, she will no longer be welcome in my home.  \n\nShe told me that I can't do that because this is her mom's home too, but it isn't.  My wife and her kids moved into my home.  It is only in my name.  I don't want to pull that card, but Kate isn't leaving my much choice and her mom is reluctant to punish Kate too harshly.  \n\nI told my wife what happened and she said that I can't do that because this is Kate's home too.  I told her that this is a hard boundary for me and it is no longer negotiable.  Kate has continued to disobey a rule I have regarding my kids.  \n\nMy wife said she will talk to Kate about it again, but I have doubts about Kate actually listening.  My wife said I took it too far and that Kate is just doing what teenagers do and that a lot of kids are on social media.  I told her that I don't care what other kids are doing, this is a rule my ex and I have for OUR kids.", "created_utc": 1669220963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2tjts/aita_for_threatening_to_kick_my_stepdaughter_out/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's your house, and Kate is a moocher who's continually biting the hand that feeds her. I understand it's trickier with blended families, but bottom line Kate is interfering with your parenting of the younger kids. She needs to go.", "NTA but your problem is much bigger than Kate. Your wife has allowed Kate to ignore your clear boundaries and exploit your children. She would rather see your young children exploited than to actually parent her daughter and enforce house rules. That isn't an issue that will stop by kicking Kate out; you have to either get your wife on board with being an actual parent to her kids or there will be more problems later.", "NTA. Kate's 19.. she's old enough to realize there are real life consequences to her inconsiderate actions. This could not only endanger the younger kids as they aren't as knowledgeable about social media but also put a huge strain on the relationship with your ex, the younger kids real mother.", "NTA\n\nKate is crossing a serious boundary. She is an adult who should respect your boundary of restricting your young children's online presence. If she can't do that, then she can live elsewhere. Don't bring up that you own the house because it's a dick move. Her mother should already know this is a serious matter and talk to her daughter about how important this is to you and to stop putting the littles on social media or she has to leave. It's an appropriate punishment, because you can't exactly take a 19 year old's phone away.", "NTA - you are protecting your children, and with good reason..\n\nBut if I were her (your wife), there are a number of points here that would increase the odds of me not wanting to be in this marriage anymore.\n\n* Yes, you are protecting your children... You are forcing her to protect hers as a result however (and your wife is not wrong, she's being a selfish twit, which is pretty standard for 19 year olds... And although in an adult sense she is endangering the kids, she is not doing so on purpose, or actively hurting them... So Mom is going to be somewhat unhappy with the threat of her being made homeless - which you ARE going to do on purpose, and IS going to actively hurt her daughter).\n* Your home isn't also your wife's home?  Really?  Think REAAALLL long and hard about why that opinion/statement might be a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall there is a sense here of \"this is mine (be it house or kids)\" and \"this is hers\" and not much ours... In general when you take point 1 into consideration, and no sense of \"us\" - I... yeah.. as a wife, I'd be ripshit at my kid, but... You're not making my teenager homeless because she's an idiot.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. Your kids, definitely your rules. You may not be her parent, but she's disrespecting you as a parent in general. 19 isn't an excuse, she knows what boundaries are. She's choosing to cross them because she knows your wife has, thus far, talked you out of any serious consequences.", "NTA. You are protecting your family. \n\nI don't think the primary problem is with your step-daughter. She's still a teenager and she still needs parenting.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think your wife is stepping up to the plate.\n\nYou have a new family, things have changed. This is new to everybody and your wife needs to work to make sure her daughter understands the adjustments she has to make.\n\nYou are providing the family with the ability to take their security for granted. You are managing that thoughtfully. Your step-daughter will not appreciate that safety net until she's an adult and has been on her own. \n\nYour wife knows better and should be a good enough parent to make sure her daughter learns to appreciate that incredible privilege. \n\nIt's fantastic your step-daughter wants to be a big sister to her step-brothers. That relationship will be valuable to all of them as they grow older.\n\nI'm a big sister and I love taking care of my bros, even at my advanced age. But with the fun comes responsibility. It's not always fun when you have to make sacrifices. \n\nYour step-daughter is too immature to appreciate the dangers of posting videos of children on the internet. But she's not too young to understand that she now has a responsibility to her new brothers to put their needs over her desires.\n\nYour wife needs to help her daughter change her perspective on her role in this new family. You can discuss, persuade and plead, but this needs to come from your wife.", "ESH \n\nIf you are not comfortable with your kids being on social media, they should not be on social media. Kate needs to respect your boundaries as their parent.\n\nWhere you lost me was the comment about house ownership. Your wife lives there full time, it's her home, and it's her children's home. It should be treated accordingly.", "Why are you leaving your kids alone with her?\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for having this boundary and being frustrated that she consistently crosses it. \n\nBut you\u2019re responsible for your kids. Seems like you need an adultier adult home with them when you can\u2019t be there as they can\u2019t seem to understand your boundary either. \n\nI don\u2019t think kicking Kate out is going to work out so well. \n\nI\u2019d just get a sitter-an actual adult.", "Why does everyone on here use \"boundary\" wrong. This is not a boundary. It's a rule or restriction. An example of a boundary is \"I will not leave my children alone with Kate if she continues making videos of them.\" A boundary is for yourself. It's not used to control others. You and you alone hold or break a boundary.\n\nOne very concerning point is when you say *I don't want to pull that card.* So you're holding the safety and security of your wife and her daughters in your back pocket as a tool to get them to obey you? That's not cool.", "Any chance you or your wife is paying the phone bill? Take the phone away. Seems more logical than kicking a kid out. Because 19 is still young, regardless of being a legal adult. \n\nIs she not allowed to video tape her step brothers at all? Or just not if she intends to post it on SM? Because if it's at all, that's a soft YTA.", "NTA, by not respecting rules for your children, she\u2019s forcing you to resort to the only thing you can reasonably do about it - throwing her out. Would your wife prefer you took legal action against her adult daughter filming your minor sons fully knowing you don\u2019t consent and publishing that content?", "As someone who is currently pregnant and told my partner I am not comfortable with putting our kid on social media until he can consent, I understand your perspective on not wanting them on social media.\n\nHowever, your kids are 8 and 10. They should be more than capable to follow rules that you've set. It also seems that when you find out that Kate has put them on Tik Tok or Instagram, you seem to only lash out at Kate, why? Your kids know that this is going on by your own admission, why are they not being punished here?\n\nI get Kate is the oldest, she should know better, she should respect your boundaries 100% but your kids are old enough to know they shouldn't be in her videos.\n\nAlso, you threatening to kick her out without speaking with her mom, yikes. Don't do that, like?\n\nYTA, punish **all** your kids, equally. They are old enough to know better.", "YTA.\nThis may have been YOUR house pre marriage, but should now be seen as a marital asset and as such this is Katie's home whether you like it or not.\nArguing differently will lead to a real divide.\nYes she's 19,but she's a child in mentality and this will damage your marriage.\nSo, is this worth your marriage? Then the house really will be half your wife's!", "Is there a middle way? Can you punish without kicking her out?", "YTA for this: \n\n>She told me that I can't do that because this is her mom's home too, but it isn't. My wife and her kids moved into my home. It is only in my name.\n\nAre you and your wife partners, or not? If you're partners, you SHARE that home, no matter whose name is on the title. Your wife uprooted herself and her children to live with you, presumably getting rid of their previous living place, so by saying that it's your home and not hers, you're effectively telling her that she and her children are homeless and staying here only by the whim of your generosity. Guests who you can get rid of if you want, not family. That's crossing a line. \n\nYour problem with your stepdaughter is legitimate, but this is NOT an okay way to solve it. If you and your wife truly can't come to an agreement about this situation, then the two of you may need to separate; but do so with honest and bipartisan communication and not by pulling the rug out from under her like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But then again 'dont film my kids' isnt that difficult a condition to agree to.", "What other choice does he have. He has no control over Kate. It\u2019s either he and the kids leave or she leaves if she doesn\u2019t stop. It was his house before he married his wife five years ago so it kinda doesn\u2019t make since on several levels for him to leave.", "Legally speaking she doesn't, morally speaking of course she should. But she's not supporting OP in his pretty reasonable boundary to keep his kids off social media. She should be doing more to parent her adult daughter so that OP doesn't feel he needs to go to these lengths for his boundaries to be respected/maintained.", "So? He can uninvite them if they cross a hard line which Kate did. If there is no other way to remedy the situation. You've read that the mother isn't doing anything but talking to her daughter about it which obviously isn't working. He's talked to her directly but she comes back with you're not my parent.\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes. Kate's an adult. She's an AH, OP is NTA.", "Invitations can be revoked. \n\nImagine there was some kind of physical abuse of his kids going on. Does he still have to allow the perpetrator to live there? No? Then we\u2019re past \u201cbeing invited\u201d trumping everything and are talking about what\u2019s justifiable.", "Kate's phone is paid for by her dad.  I doubt that sort of thing would go over well.", "They are literal children and Kate is a fuckin grown ass 19 yr old. She's been told what the (pretty reasonable) rule is and refuses to respect OP in his own home regarding his own kids. It should not be on children to police what an adult does.", "It\u2019s her home, but she don\u2019t own it", ">She just can't film and post it\n\nBut that's the whole point, isn't it?  She wouldn't be doing these things with my kids if she couldn't exploit it for \"likes.\"", "When she started mixing a bunch of crap (most likely weird/gross) together in a bowl for people to watch them eat, it took a sharp turn from quality time into bullying.", "Well, she\u2019s disrespecting his rules for his own kids and pulling the \u201cyou\u2018re not my father card\u201c while at the same time demanding he takes care of her like a father would. \nI\u2018m in Europe as well so I do think it\u2019s normal to still live at home at 19, but anyone who doesn\u2019t want to follow rules as simple as \u201cdon\u2019t put videos of your minor stepsiblings online\u201c can\u2019t expect that to habe no consequences.", "She is not endangering your children on purpose, she's not an adult, and isn't comprehending why it matters to parents to not have their kids online, and the risk it creates for the kids. \n\nFrom my own experience being in my late teens early 20s, and as the mother of an 18 year old, her gooey semi-formed brain is saying, \"Oh it's not that big a risk, they're just worry warts, and this makes the kids laugh, and it's fun!\" - it may be STUPID (as I said, she's definitely the asshole here) but she's not an adult.. Her brain isn't fully formed and she's not doing this to hurt her step-siblings.", "And protested that OP can\u2019t kick Kate out because it\u2019s her home too. So ownership is relevant because technically the OP *can* kick her out.", "You\u2019re not wrong,your rule for your children is completely reasonable and a 19 year old should be able to follow this simple rule.", "How is you not punishing your own kids not a point of this post? Of course it is. \n\nEveryone involved in old enough to know that they shouldn't be doing what they are doing, and I'm assuming you don't tell your kids that they are no longer welcome in your home for not listening, so why just Kate?\n\nNot to mention, you talk about how they are your kids, and how Kate is your step-kid in posts. How would you feel if down the line your kids disobeyed a rule your wife set and she told them they can no longer come to your home?", "She is your kid by marriage. If you\u2019re really dedicated to the \u201cnot my kid\u201d thing, you might need to figure out what it means to be married to a woman with a kid. \n\n(Let me be clear, NTA for the filming. But no one that young should be kicked out over something that can be fixed through other means)", "I\u2019m sure if she ignored them and told them to go away whenever they asked to join in her dances he\u2019d be upset over that as well. Maybe he should be paying more attention to his kids if this is such a big deal to him. Sounds like there\u2019s no winning for Kate. YTA, OP.", "Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t work that way?  When someone establishes residency somewhere you can\u2019t just kick them out, but ok.", "Nevertheless, since she lives with you and her mother, her mother should have the right to temporarily confiscate the phone.", "No that\u2019s not what he said, he clearly states that it\u2019s not her home.", "That's exactly my point. Seems like mom could present it to her that way and get her to see the big picture.", "But she is an adult. Whether she agrees with OP or not she's grown enough to understand he is setting a boundary and she should respect that. When I was that age(not terribly long ago)I wouldn't even think of crossing boundaries regarding someone's kids especially when told explicitly what those boundaries are. Being young n dumb doesn't exclude you from consequences either and it seems that OPs wife isn't leaving him many options on how to proceed here.", "As I said, he's not wrong, and I completely agree with him. \n\nHowever, 8 and 10 year olds should also know better and should also listen.", "Sure they should listen but their older cool sister is encouraging them to continue to break the rules its more on her than it is them. She\u2019s the one with a phone, shes the one with social media, shes the one mixing bs in a bowl to film them eating and they are just being an 8 and 10 year old going along with it she is an adult and they are children and if she cant respect his rules and his wife refuses to enforce them then she has to go maybe she can go stay with her dad but OP is nta she is constantly undermining his authority in front of his children thats a huge NO for me."]}
