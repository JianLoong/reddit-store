I had talked to him before about relationships but never deeply. Now he entrusted me with some things about his marriage and how it wasn't going very well (not much going on in bed, he kinda blamed it on the time when his kid was still a baby). I shared my opinion on marriage and having kids, and the conversation slowly turned towards my previous relationships and why I currently wasn't in one.\n\nI don't really want kids because my career is important to me, plus other reasons, but a big factor is also that sex just isn't my thing. I can't switch off my head as I constantly think about whether I'm doing it right etc., and I get no pleasure out of it because I hardly ever feel the desire to have sex at all. I don't even want to think about it, and I find naked people disgusting actually. I definitely consider myself to be on the asexual spectrum, or maybe demisexual.\n\nAnyway, he then started asking whether it'd help me if he gave me more inside on the topic, and said how much he would like to lift the pressure off my shoulders, and that I was probably the only person thinking so much about it. For him, after all, it's the most pleasant thing in the world and he thinks that I didn't see it all yet.\n\nI told him I didn't think that more insight would help as I made my experiences and it would never be intuitive for me. I don't even remember saying that this is a problem for me. I said I find it quite a bit disrespectful that he seems to be wanting to force his opinion about it onto me. Then I again mentioned the topic of asexuality and tried to explain the difference to romantic attraction, which I do experience quite a bit more often. \n\nTo this he responded that he doesn't want to force his opinion onto me, but that a point of view is closely related to experience and insight, and such a pov can be incomplete. I should be open to new insight, and maybe I haven't seen it all yet, or something along the lines.\n\nMy answer was that I am not up for discussing my personal experience, insight, feelings or views, as it is my life and I'm no child and have made experiences. I can decide for myself what I want and know best what I need. The only thing I want is for him to accept this.\n\nHis last response said that he thinks I actually do behave like a child. He sees my reaction as defiance and that I in no way want to allow any discussion. He's never seen such a self-opinionated person as I seem to be, who doesn't let anything get to herself.\n\nI'm not going to respond to him anymore, but AITA for not wanting to discuss my opinion about this anymore? I'm at a loss as to where he takes the right from to talk to me like that. After all, I also accept his opinion on sex and don't try to convince him from my point of view.\n\nEdit, as it came up a few times: I'm on the autistic spectrum as well and am bad at reading between the lines, so no, it didn't occur to me at first that he might be trying to have sex with me.", "created_utc": 1670656516, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhlu79/aita_for_not_wanting_to_discuss_my_opinion_on_sex/", "score": 272, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Girl, do not spend another second worrying about this man\u2019s opinions. It sounds like he was trying to get in your pants and when you reaffirmed your disinterest in sex he fell all over himself trying to invalidate and infantilize you. Let go of the idea that you need to sift through his misogynistic, manipulative, narrow-minded views for kernels of truth. He is not worth your time and energy. Save your social investments for people who come to the table with the awareness that you\u2019re an independent human being who is entitled to full bodily autonomy and respect.

Once you've been exposed to this appalling behaviour you can spot it a mile off, if you are looking for it. Them knowing will help them step in sooner to run interference. My experience is people who don't know are more likely to let some behaviour slip through - your physical safety and mental health is not worth having a buddy let one go through to the keeper because they didn't know why you were trying to keep your distance.", "Calling her childish is also the other side of old creeps trying to convince much younger women to have sex with them, by saying \"you're so mature for your age\".", "You just laid out everything I was thinking. \n\nThat guy is so fn creepy,  my skin was crawling just reading that post.

Report him then. Document everything, dates, times, what was said, any witnesses, texts, emails. He's being grossly inappropriate at best.

These men think they know us because we're willing to share certain things about our life with them and mistake respectful friendship for being pursued by a young, beautiful woman. When we let them down easy or disappoint their fantasy, they often start getting mean, even verbally/emotionally abusive, and turn to belittling us for all the things they found desireable about us.
