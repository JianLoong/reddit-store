I had talked to him before about relationships but never deeply. Now he entrusted me with some things about his marriage and how it wasn't going very well (not much going on in bed, he kinda blamed it on the time when his kid was still a baby). I shared my opinion on marriage and having kids, and the conversation slowly turned towards my previous relationships and why I currently wasn't in one.\n\nI don't really want kids because my career is important to me, plus other reasons, but a big factor is also that sex just isn't my thing. I can't switch off my head as I constantly think about whether I'm doing it right etc., and I get no pleasure out of it because I hardly ever feel the desire to have sex at all. I don't even want to think about it, and I find naked people disgusting actually. I definitely consider myself to be on the asexual spectrum, or maybe demisexual.\n\nAnyway, he then started asking whether it'd help me if he gave me more inside on the topic, and said how much he would like to lift the pressure off my shoulders, and that I was probably the only person thinking so much about it. For him, after all, it's the most pleasant thing in the world and he thinks that I didn't see it all yet.\n\nI told him I didn't think that more insight would help as I made my experiences and it would never be intuitive for me. I don't even remember saying that this is a problem for me. I said I find it quite a bit disrespectful that he seems to be wanting to force his opinion about it onto me. Then I again mentioned the topic of asexuality and tried to explain the difference to romantic attraction, which I do experience quite a bit more often. \n\nTo this he responded that he doesn't want to force his opinion onto me, but that a point of view is closely related to experience and insight, and such a pov can be incomplete. I should be open to new insight, and maybe I haven't seen it all yet, or something along the lines.\n\nMy answer was that I am not up for discussing my personal experience, insight, feelings or views, as it is my life and I'm no child and have made experiences. I can decide for myself what I want and know best what I need. The only thing I want is for him to accept this.\n\nHis last response said that he thinks I actually do behave like a child. He sees my reaction as defiance and that I in no way want to allow any discussion. He's never seen such a self-opinionated person as I seem to be, who doesn't let anything get to herself.\n\nI'm not going to respond to him anymore, but AITA for not wanting to discuss my opinion about this anymore? I'm at a loss as to where he takes the right from to talk to me like that. After all, I also accept his opinion on sex and don't try to convince him from my point of view.", "created_utc": 1670656516, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhlu79/aita_for_not_wanting_to_discuss_my_opinion_on_sex/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Friends don't insist you need more sexual experience in order to determine your sexual identity, because a friend isn't going to focuse on, or even be interested in, that aspect of your life.", "NTA. Girl, do not spend another second worrying about this man\u2019s opinions. It sounds like he was trying to get in your pants and when you reaffirmed your disinterest in sex he fell all over himself trying to invalidate and infantilize you. Let go of the idea that you need to sift through his misogynistic, manipulative, narrow-minded views for kernels of truth. He is not worth your time and energy. Save your social investments for people who come to the table with the awareness that you\u2019re an independent human being who is entitled to full bodily autonomy and respect. His views on sex and gender are prehistoric and his \u201ccriticisms\u201d were entirely self-serving.", "If she entertained the conversation further it would have led to \u201cyou just haven\u2019t had the right guy. You didn\u2019t enjoy it with someone your age but I have plenty of experience and could definitely change your mind about sex\u201d\n\nReminds me of a time when a girl I knew was getting some work done, went from a small B to a larger C. When she was casually mentioning about it, a guy from work walked up. He joined in the conversation and started being a little too interested. I told him to drop it because I knew eventually he would ask to see them or test drive them when the procedure was over", "Didn't need to read much past the title and ages to put that together", "Yep.\n\nHe\u2019s definitely trying to get into OP\u2019s pants.", "Yep!! and he\u2019s seeing if she wants to be a step mommy so he can have a replacement bang maid/nanny before he decides to leave his wife who he currently treats as a bang maid/nanny.", "Literally every line he pulled was one both I and my female friends have heard verbatim from guys trying to fuck.", "This is what I was thinking too\ud83e\udd14", "I knew where this was heading halfway the first paragraph.", "He wants to shove more than an unwanted opinion down her throat. That's for sure.", "Every clich\u00e9 in the book.  So gross.", "^This\n\nOP You are NTA\n\nDo not let him get you in any isolated situation. This includes kitchens, desk cubicles, photocopy areas.\n\nIf you have to, ask your boss to move desks, for safety.\n\nAnd/or buddy with another colleague or two or three who do everything, (and i mean everything) with you, probably at least til February when office life gets back to normal.\n\nAnd have quiet chats with boss/colleagues who are buddying with you to say why, that you feel uncomfortable. Once you've been exposed to this appalling behaviour you can spot it a mile off, if you are looking for it. Them knowing will help them step in sooner to run interference. My experience is people who don't know are more likely to let some behaviour slip through - your physical safety and mental health is not worth having a buddy let one go through to the keeper because they didn't know why you were trying to keep your distance.", "Calling her childish is also the other side of old creeps trying to convince much younger women to have sex with them, by saying \"you're so mature for your age\".", "You just laid out everything I was thinking. \n\nThat guy is so fn creepy,  my skin was crawling just reading that post. So much ew in there. \n\nOp is NTA", "Don't be mad at yourself. If you have never been in this position before how are you to know the signs? You don't know what you don't know. \n\nAs for seeing him at work now - I would just ignore him. If he continues to try and talk to you or starts treating you poorly- go to HR with screen shots of the conversation (if it was over text or email)", "He's taking advantage of you.", "That's what makes this even worse. Report him then. Document everything, dates, times, what was said, any witnesses, texts, emails. He's being grossly inappropriate at best. If he's having problems with his wife, he should talk to her or a marriage counselor, not a woman young enough to be his daughter and trying to give her sex advice. In the meantime, only talk about work. When he tries to get inappropriate/personal (and anything personal at this point is inappropriate), change the subject to work. He persists? Tell him you need to talk about only about work. Document telling him. \n\nHe's a creep! NTA."]}
