I called my gf\u2019s brothers, who I\u2019m very close to, let\u2019s called them Brother A and Brother B, and asked if we could stay with them until we find a more permanent place to stay. They insisted that we stayed free of charge as long as we contributed to the grocery bill and kept the place clean. Brother B is a professional chef, while Brother A is in university for business, and is likely to have their dad\u2019s family business past down to him. They had a spare room for us to sleep in, and Brother B even gave us his bed to sleep in, while he sleeps on an air mattress, because \u201cI don\u2019t get any b\\*tches.\u201d \n\n  \nAnyways, Brother A and B invited their parents over, because their parents, especially their dad, can\u2019t resist a free meal from their professional chef son. Brother B made a delicious dinner. When we were finished, Brother A and my gf took the dishes into the kitchen to help Brother B clean up, and my gf said before she left, \u201cDaddy, he has something important to talk to you about.\u201d   \nI was left alone at the table with her parents and I was tomato red. I mustarded up an apology and explained that I never told my dad any of that stuff and I don\u2019t know how my dad knows about it, and that I would never share to anyone, because that stays between my gf and I. I also emphasized that his daughter is the love of my life and I love her more than anyone and anything in the world, and that I have immense respect for him. He said nothing and just stared at me for a good minute, before shouting at Brother A to bring him some beers. He opened two beer for himself and I, his wife doesn\u2019t drink, and clinked bottles with me. He explained that he forgives me and that he believes me. He added that he thinks my dad is a weirdo, and that they used to go out for drinks or fishing all the time, but now he\u2019s stopped, to avoid hearing about his daughter\u2019s personal life. He put his hand on my shoulder and told me that he trusts that his daughter chose the right man, which made me want to cry.\n\n  \nBad news is my parents are getting a divorce. When I left, I sat my parents down and explained to them why I was leaving. My mom hugged me and cried, while my dad said and did nothing. My gf and I left right away. Turns out my dad didn\u2019t take it well and my parents starting fighting a lot. Now, my mom is divorcing my dad. I especially feel bad for my mom, because this was her second marriage, and the longer one, and I feel like it might discourage my mom from finding love again.\n\n  \nTL;DR, I fixed my relationship with my gf\u2019s dad, but I unintentionally ruined my parents\u2019 marriage.", "created_utc": 1694887784, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ke0cg/update_aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_hes_the/", "score": 643, "replies": ["Op, let me make one small correction.  You didn't ruin your parents' marriage, your dad did that through his own words.", "OP, you didn't ruin your parents' marriage - your dad did that.\n\nPS - glad you have an awesome supportive family.", "Eewwww.\n\nYour dad was creeping on your gf,someone he\u2019s known since she was a child, so bad that he flipped out when you took her away from his house .\n\nI\u2019m glad your mom is leaving his creepy butt behind.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't ruin your parents' marriage, your father ruined his own marriage with his creepy fixation / fantasies about your girlfriend.\n\nI think your mom heard about them and it was either the straw that broke the camel's back or it opened her eyes to other things that had happened.\n\n\nGlad your gf's dad believes you.", "Oh hon. You didn\u2019t ruin your parents\u2019 marriage. This is likely all on your dad. Your mom was right to be mad at this and him for his behavior & it likely opened her eyes to a whole lot more under the tip of that particularly unsavory iceberg. Stuff you can\u2019t un-know that colors everything else in a new and untenable light. He showed his whole ass & didn\u2019t back down? Her choice is smart, healthy & has dignity.\n\nIt\u2019s said that there\u2019s no unhappy divorces, just unhappy marriages. Meaning, if you\u2019re divorcing, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve made the healthier choice to go your separate ways rather than suffer a dying, broken relationship that\u2019s run its course. That staying together just because of time invested or \u201cthat\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do\u201d isn\u2019t saving a happy marriage. It\u2019s doubling down on pain.\n\nIt\u2019s better to split & retain what you can of (hopefully!) eventual amicable regard instead of run it all down into hell trying to pretend it\u2019s not broken & end up breaking up anyhow, but now with irrevocable vitriol.\n\nYour parents are adults making a choice that is theirs to make and which is *solely* theirs to be responsible for. You did nothing wrong & bear no responsibility here.\n\nI\u2019m so glad you have your gf, her family and their support. Be there for your mom, and be an open ear for your dad in case he wants to grow up eventually. But mostly your mom. It can\u2019t be fun hearing that your future ex-husband has been creeping on your son\u2019s probable future wife & blabbing unsolicited with zero filter to your probable future FIL - ruining not only his relationship with his wife but with his former close friend as well! Yikes. \ud83d\ude2c\n\n(Btw, if this *is* wildly out of the norm for your dad - esp his doubling down & fighting about it? a neurological or dementia test may very well be in order) \n\nAs to your mom being perhaps discouraged, I dunno - she\u2019s showing healthy self respect here & that bodes well for her. I think going forward, just being included in & witnessing the healthier dynamic of your future in laws should go a long way to helping her see there\u2019s hope and health to be found in the future. She already knows what she won\u2019t stand for & doesn\u2019t deserve and she\u2019s right. \u2764\ufe0f", "Excellent news, even if you didn't use my dartboard idea.  And it is clear that you have shown your gf's dad that this apple fell far from the paternal tree.\n\nDon't fret about the divorce.  Methinks your mom has been dealing with similar BS during her marriage that you were shielded from.   You're as innocent as a snowflake...that just landed softly on the mountainside primed to make things very exciting for the Alpine village below.", "Sometimes the family you pick is way better than the one you\u2019re born into\u2026 good choice!!! \n\nNTA", "OP congrats on having hard conversations.\n\nI wish you and your loving new family only love and the best.\nP.

That's why your mother is divorcing him.\n\nGlad you sorted it with your GF's dad.", "Your father ruined his marriage by being disrespectful of his wife, his son, and his friend's daughter all at once.", "Bro your parents aren\u2019t divorcing because of what you said, it\u2019s because of what he said. If my partner was vividly discussing and talking about\u2026 well, anyone\u2019s sex life, to the point where it\u2019s this gross and uncomfortable, and to their dad? I\u2019d rethink things too, g.

I'd bet there's some deeper issue that your issue is tangentially related to that's been set off/dug up by that conversation.\n\nEither way, it's not your fault, but I'm sorry it turned out that way.", "Honestly if these are the options, tell your mom to date herself.  Eff love.  It's nice, but my dog isn't gonna cheat on me or lie in a way that isn't totally adorable and forgivable. And my vibrator is also more reliable.", "Dear lord, I hope he wasn't fantasizing about my girlfriend", "I mean I could still play darts with him, and depending on how he feels about my dad, he could still stick his pic there", "She really is. I hope she finds a wonderful man that will be right for her.", "I would say to his friend too. I don't think you should be talking about someone's daughter having sex to them.", "Of course he was. Where do you think all those comments came from? He was picturing your and your gf having sex.", "even if he wasn't (which is.... debatable) - the fact that he made A N Y comment about your sex life, any comment abt his friends daughters sex life, and especially any comment abt a friends daughters who he has known her entire lifes sex life is completely inappropriate and gross. just one of these things is enough to break up a marriage - and he did all three. regardless of his interest in your gf, ANY type of sexual comment in relation to a child (not technically children, but to your parents you are) indicates far far far too much interest in the sex life of the child - simply put, you, your mother, and your gf did nothing wrong: your moms leaving your dad bc of his own creepy and super weird actions", "i hope it is okay if I light a candle for her in my prayers tonight \ud83d\udc98\n\nshe deserves all the strength and softness rn \n\nbe well Opie \ud83e\udd70 you always have a dump space with this pnw weirdo if needed", "it is not your fault they divorce", "Your Dad ruined his marriage, just like he ruined his friendship with your GF's Dad, and his relationship with you. He chose to say and do the things that broke all of those relationships, and I'm glad the rest of you are staying strong together. Be there for your mom, and be happy.", "That may seem like bad news at the moment but it's best for your mum not to have to put up with your father.\n\nSorry your dad is weird, but that's not your fault any more than it's your mum's. His marriage falling apart is on him, not you, not her.\n\nNTA", "I am so confused by your father's behavior. So creepy and disgusting to perv out about you having sex with your girlfriend.\n\nI'm guessing your mother found out some more unsavory details about what your father was up to, hence the divorce?\n\nThe fact that he was so stimulated about your sex life with your girlfriend (relishing discussing it) is deserving of a divorce. Very unnatural situation.", "Nta. You didn't ruin the relationship between your parents. That is on him/them. Not sure what is up w your dad but thats not normal behavior. Maybe from a 13-14 yr old but not from an adult. And if he behaves anything like that towards or abt your mom, shes probably going to be grateful in the long run", "Such a great end result. Did your GFs dad ever tell you the exact reason why he initially became less close to your dad before? Also, I have a feeling there is much Korean to your mom and dad splitting than just this... I think this was just the icing on the cake for your mom that finally pushed her over the edge. And yes, your dad was definitely fetishizing your GF.", "1. I\u2019m so glad both you and your girlfriend are out of that situation and away from him. Your dad sounds both fixated and as though he doesn\u2019t care about boundaries, which are big red flags for predatory behavior, which could have easily escalated.\n\n2. Confrontations can be very hard and I\u2019m glad you found the courage to step up and speak to both your parents, and your girlfriend\u2019s family. You should be proud of the strong man and partner you are becoming.\n\n3. Your parents\u2019 divorce is not your fault. Your mother sounds like a good person, and if she wants to, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll have no trouble finding someone who will love and cherish her. I know that if I found out my partner had been acting so despicable, especially to my own kids, I\u2019d absolutely want to know and wouldn\u2019t be comfortable or okay with those comments in any way, shape, or form.", "I'd like to make a second, smaller correction. You muster courage. You put mustard on a hot dog.", "Yeah that is like graduate level creeping there has to be more going on that op just thankfully wasn\u2019t in the know about. Also eww eww ewww what the HECK", "How is that saying goes? That Old Cat Lady isn't women's nightmare, it's men's. Because if you see a woman with a cat but no guy it's because she did the math on her relationships and men lost out to a Hitachi wand and an animal who shits in a box.", "Very true. My father is also a creep, so I get the mix of disgust & pity, but it's their own fault."]}
