My niece is the only little girl in my family, so it's pretty much expected by the whole family that she will be a flower girl in our wedding. For some background, many members of my family (myself included) think that she is on the autism spectrum, but my sister and BIL refuse to entertain any idea of that being a possibility. I absolutely adore my niece, but after seeing her as the flower girl in my brother's wedding last week I do not want her in mine. \n\nExamples include chucking the flower petals at the guests like she was pitching a major league baseball game, screeching through the entire ceremony, getting up onto the altar and doing a Fortnite dance while they were exchanging their vows, climbing onto the tables during dinner, going to the middle of the dance floor during the wedding party speeches and taking her dress off, and grabbing the microphone to announce that she had to poop.\n\nShe is an only child so my sister and BIL think this is completely normal for her age and that her antics are just THE CUTEST, so it's not easy to ask them to supervise her more closely and to be honest, I don't trust that they would if I asked. I love my niece, but she is out of control in formal settings.\n\nI feel really selfish for thinking that she will ruin my wedding, but I was mad FOR the bride last week and can't imagine how I would feel if it were me. I don't want to upset anyone by not asking her or having to explain why I'm not asking her, and she will still be invited to the wedding so I'm sure there will be some antics, but after discussing it with my fiance we agree that we do NOT want her to be a part of the ceremony.\n\nSo, WIBTA for asking his niece to be our flower girl and excluding my own?\n\n*EDIT* my niece has exhibited behavior associated with ASD since she started walking. I only mentioned the possibility of ASD as an explanation of why her acting outside of social norms could be due to reasons other than her being a brat/having bad parents/being a bad kid, which is why I think I might be the asshole", "created_utc": 1694031335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bup58/wibta_if_i_didnt_ask_my_niece_to_be_a_flower_girl/", "score": 1828, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The behavior you described is not typical of a three year old at a serious event like a wedding. Good Luck!", "NTA. This girl's parents should have coached and prepared her to be a flower girl.  My daughter was also a flower girl at my sister's wedding at the age of three, and I would have been mortified if she had behaved like that. I would definitely have removed her from the room the moment she began screeching, and when she asked why we were sitting out in the car I would have explained that we weren't going back until she had calmed down. Of course, it never got to that point at the wedding because I had already established standards for public behavior in far less formal situations. It's sad that your sister and BIL are effectively depriving your niece of opportunities by refusing to properly parent her.", "NTA. Do you really need flower girls at all? It may be easier to just say you are not having them. The 3 year old definitely will not care. You can  say you decided to streamline the wedding party. If asked \"why\" just say \"because that is what we decided.\"", "NTA and to be perfectly honest if I was in your shoes I wouldn't want her in the wedding at all.

Communication is important.", "NTA\n\nI got married last summer and had my two nephews, my niece and my two daughters in the wedding, at the time they were 9,5,23 months, 10 months and 13, every single child behaved perfectly in the ceremony and at the reception. We had about another 10 children as guests and there were no problems. Your niece sounds like she\u2019s not been given boundaries and now this is the consequence, at 5 she\u2019s old enough to know better.", "NTA this is why it\u2019s common for a kid free wedding so they can\u2019t ruin everything by screaming", "NTA and a 5 year old should be able to control their behavior better than that. I do think it will be awkward to ask the younger girl and not the older one but bottom line, it's your wedding and your niece sounds like an undisciplined brat.", "NTA. When my daughter was a flower girl, she was really little and dumped all the flowers in one place rather than spreading them. Things like that are kind of expected. But not what you experienced. The niece who I guess would be better behaved is younger, so to minimize family tension it might be better to skip the flower girl.", "I\u2019d go child free.  The flower girl part is the least of your worries. The ceremony, the reception will still be disrupted if she attends.  In fact, it could be worse if her parents praised her funny behaviour last time", "After the behavior that you witnessed, you are completely NTA to disinvite the 5 year old from your wedding and make the 3 year old your flower girl.

The longer this continues the worse quality of life the child will have", "NTA.\n\nHow about a no flower girl option? I knew someone who got around a similar problem\\*\\* by having a flower cat. How they trained that beastie floof to walk down the aisle with an itty bitty harness remains a slight mystery, but it was SO CUTE.\n\n\\*\\*Their issue wasn't terribly behaved little girls, but too many little girls in the family and the battle ultimately wasn't worth it. It as either no flower girls at all or ALL them MF adult relatives were DIS-INVITED.

You can have a wedding without one.\n\nIf you really want the 3-yr-old, there's no way around it. \"Little Audrey just isn't ready for a formal wedding. Every child is different. So that's our decision, not anyone else's.\"\n\nNTA, by the way.", "NTA and the diplomatic way to achieve this is to say, \u201coh since she just got to be a flower girl, we thought it would be nice to let another little girl in the family have a turn\u201d. There, done! And you don\u2019t need to get in a fight over the behavior", "NTA. But if you think the other niece is going to perform perfectly,  you're in for a shock. Kids that young are unreliable. It's kinda mean to stick them in front of all those people and expect them to act normally.", "NTA, and you should fully explain why she won't be included. \n\nWhile it is understandable that they have the right to parent her as they wish within legal means, but as she continues to age, people will be less inclined to include her or them in important events such as these. \n\nThere is nothing AH about setting boundaries and telling them what behaviors you are willing to accept for a very expensive moment of your life.\n\nYou just witnessed exactly how it will play out, and you obviously care that your day does not. \n\nStand strong and be honest. They need the honesty.", "NTA I wouldn't even want her at the wedding.", "Either make wedding child free or age limited 8+ making sure to state on invitations and that NO EXCEPTIONS WILL BE MADE or sit sis down and tell her that she either completely controls ALL her child's behavior and you  ABSOLUTELY didn't see anything remotely cute or acceptable in  any of her child's behavior at brothers wedding and that that kind of behavior WILL NOT BE TOLERATED at your wedding and 1 single outburst of any kind and her and her child will be escorted out or she can find child care for her child and not bring her to the wedding. And that her child will not be flower girl and neither of these things are up for discussion, debate, or argument. And you will tell parents and family the same thing if she chooses to whine to family about your decision.", "NTA.\n\nNeice has proven that she cannot behave at weddings or other formal occasions. There's nothing positive to show you that she won't do it again at yours. So, no to being the flower girl and I would say no to the wedding, too, especially if you can't trust the level of supervision that sister and BIL will give.", "Definitely NTA. There is something wrong with parents who tolerate any of that behavior and possibly an issue with the child. I wouldn\u2019t allow her to be a flower girl or even allow her at the wedding unless you were prepared to have someone remove her if she starts to act up.", "YWNBTAH also, child-free weddings are currently the rage.", "You can say we are just having 1 flower girl and since she has already been one, we are making his niece the flower girl.", "NTA but probably less drama if you omit a flower girl altogether. Better still consider a child free wedding or only children older than 10 for example", "I don't think talking to the parents will help. They seems oblivious to what their child's do to other peoples celebration. I would stick to your guns in just keep her as a guest. There may be some hurt feelings, or maybe threats of not coming, but I would still stick to my guns because you don't want that kind of chaos at your wedding.

Lots of my family are on it.  Nothing in her behavior looked like it. But it does look like a totally out of control brat with indulgent, AH parents.  This isn\u2019t to say that she isn\u2019t ND, for other reasons.  She could be. But all the stuff you mentioned isn\u2019t related.  That was just a lack of parenting.

Your niece\u2019s behavior was not okay, but the larger problem is that you sister and BIL are not doing their job as her parents to correct her behavior or get her the support she needs. \n\nI think it would be fine to be honest, Daughter\u2019s behavior was not okay and since you chose not to intervene, she is not invited to the wedding.\u201d But I lean towards blunt, so I understand if you want a more polite way to handle it. Hopefully their daughter attending school will help them realize how bad her behavior is and how much she needs them to intervene.", "NTA, as someone who's Autistic with 2 kids who are both looking that way.

My niece is the only little girl in my family, so it's pretty much expected by the whole family that she will be a flower girl in our wedding. For some background, many members of my family (myself included) think that she is on the autism spectrum, but my sister and BIL refuse to entertain any idea of that being a possibility. I absolutely adore my niece, but after seeing her as the flower girl in my brother's wedding last week I do not want her in mine. \n\nExamples include chucking the flower petals at the guests like she was pitching a major league baseball game, screeching through the entire ceremony, getting up onto the altar and doing a Fortnite dance while they were exchanging their vows, climbing onto the tables during dinner, going to the middle of the dance floor during the wedding party speeches and taking her dress off, and grabbing the microphone to announce that she had to poop.\n\nShe is an only child so my sister and BIL think this is completely normal for her age and that her antics are just THE CUTEST, so it's not easy to ask them to supervise her more closely and to be honest, I don't trust that they would if I asked. I love my niece, but she is out of control in formal settings.\n\nI feel really selfish for thinking that she will ruin my wedding, but I was mad FOR the bride last week and can't imagine how I would feel if it were me. I don't want to upset anyone by not asking her or having to explain why I'm not asking her, and she will still be invited to the wedding so I'm sure there will be some antics, but after discussing it with my fiance we agree that we do NOT want her to be a part of the ceremony.\n\nSo, WIBTA for asking his niece to be our flower girl and excluding my own?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The  since I was the only girl they tried again when I was 5 at another cousin's wedding wedding and when I finished throwing the flowers, I announced to everyone that I'd earned an extra cake, kicked the groom in the crotch (idk why) and ran to my mother by leaping over people.\n\nI'm allegedly 100% mental sound, no autism or anything. The groom I put ched in the nuts was a jerk and they divorced in a year and now she's married to a wonderful man but I was not their flower girl. \n\nKids are weird. Do what you want, bit by not allowing her in you're not 100% avoiding disaster...", "Not the asshole but they will call you the asshole! It\u2019s your wedding and you can do what you want. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation and no offence but your Sister and Brother In Law need to do more with their child\u2019s behaviour whether or not she is on the spectrum. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll start getting cut off from family parties if they continue that. Lack of discipline and horrible parenting!", "Idk, the whole situation sucks here. I guess I'll say NTA but there are some things to consider too. At first I was like, yes you would be. Then I read what you said. And at first I still thought you would be TA. Throwing petals hard? Who cares. Then I kept reading.\n\nSo the part of me that was *going* to say yes was for this reason: I had both my nieces as joint flower girls. They were 1.5 years and not almost 4 years (but not even.) I left it up to my sister whether she thought the 1.5 year old would get too stressed or not, and my sister said she wouldn't, but warned me it was NOT going to be perfect. I was absolutely fine with this. At the wedding, one of the highlights that everyone still talks about was how my toddler niece decided she should pick up the petals her sister was so carelessly throwing about haha! I didn't get to see much (It wasn't my turn to walk yet) but by all accounts it was super cute, especially when the almost 4-year-old niece helped her make it down the aisle! So cute, and I'm so so glad I had both of them in my wedding, for the cuteses and because you know... now they will always have both in my wedding.\n\n***However***, my flower girls were not even 4, and 1.5 years, as I mentioned, and this was like perfectly imperfect adorable kid stuff.\n\nMy wedding was about 1 year and 2 months ago. So my nieces are just turned 5, and 2.5 years. They would never do half the stuff you described- neither of them. Even if they were okay with doing things like that- their parents would never ever allow that.\n\nThere are some considerations, because your niece will likely remember being uninvited from the wedding. However, hopefully when she's older, she will understand why, and may well blame her parents if she ever sees footage from your brother's wedding. Still, it is something to consider.\n\nEven though I by no means wanted or required a \"perfect\" wedding, I wouldn't want what you described to happen at my wedding either. Which leads us to a consideration about life in general: her parents need to figure out if it is their parenting, or if she is autistic, and make some changes.\n\nMy 5 year old niece is the most amazing intelligent kid I have ever met, but even she has some outbursts occasionally, and with her intelligence she already feeling alienated because of that, and her feelings about the fact that she's having these emotions spill over are making things hard for her. Luckily my sister and BIL are really helping her work through that, and I think a lot of it is a result of the daycare she was at and how they handled things. But if she is 5 and starting to feel alienated and mad at herself for some minor emotional outbursts, I can only guess that your 7 year old niece is probably already having a really rough time fitting in with kids her age, and it's only going to get worse.\n\nYou should be honest with your sister and BIL, and explain to them that as much as you'd love to have your niece in your wedding, the way she acted at your brother's wedding attracted a lot of negative attention for her and you don't want her to have to go through that again. It's time they had a wake up call so they can start doing what is best for their kid. Because it's not sitting their and saying \"how cute\" when she's doing this at that age.\n\nAge 7 is first or second grade level. Do you remember anyone in your class at that age taking off their clothes, getting up and break dancing during the teacher talking, church, or worse, a wedding? How about yelling that they have to poop? It's not healthy for her parents to be encourage this sort of thing and not getting her help if she is on the spectrum.", "If the sister and brother-in-law are on Reddit and come across this thread\u2026 get your daughter check or be better parents in public settings.

She should never have been allowed to act like she did and it doesn't take corporal discipline to control her. She should simply have been made to stay off the dance floor, away from the microphone and generally kept under control for the formal parts of the reception. If that meant taking her outside of the church, outside of the reception venue, then so be it. That's what a responsible parent does.

Went back to the lodging with the younger crowd and a few adults who were getting tired.", "I expect a young flower girl to get a little enthusiastic with the petals but the rest of it is out of line for what is generally considered a formal event", "Or worse they even encourage that behaviour.", "If a flower girl doesn't throw the petals until the end of the ceremony, I think most people would find that pretty cute. Hell, even piffing the petals at people could be pretty cute if it's not accompanied by other bad behaviours. Most people don't expect a child with a job at a wedding to be a perfect angel, no matter how much you practice, and seeing a kid mess up a little can be a bit cute. But that's where your other activities come to play - making sure that when she's not causing a scene at other times and that she's not bothering other people makes her cute, rather than a brat and I'm sure it'll also have an effect on her behaviour in other parts of life.", "Parents are doing her a disadvantage by not getting early intervention for this. The earlier, the better, and hopefully less stressful once things like school, friend bday parties, or whatever, start to come into play. \n\nPlus earlier interventions create early boundaries and learning consequences. \n\nIn a few years ops sister will be like \u201cwhy isn\u2019t she invited to friend party too?! She only destroyed the last cake and only opened 4 presents that weren\u2019t hers, then screeched like a pterodactyl for 14 mins\u201d", "It actually takes many years of specialized therapy to learn impulse control for someone on thevspectrum", "I can imagine a 3yo remembering being in the wedding, because there will be photos and conversations to help fix it in her mind; but will she remember not being in the wedding? No.", "Some people do, some people don't. I have a good chunk of memories starting at about 3, like going to Disney world and the beach with my parents and grandma. Going to Kings Island for the first time. And I remember being a flower girl twice at 4 years old. I wore the same dress for both they just changed the color of the trim from red to pink. I even remember the ring bearer crying/throwing a fit and mean mugging him for acting like such a baby. Lol. \n\nEdit to add; however, my oldest daughter doesn't remember much before she was 5 except a caterpillar peeing on her hand once and that her dad rode her scooter and ran over a poopy diaper. Their dad doesn't remember anything before like 7 years old but he also had a rough/abusive childhood.", "I\u2019m autistic and ADHD. I come from a family where 1/3 of us are neurodiverse\u2026 The throwing of the petals incorrectly, the screeching, the taking off of clothing can all definitely be signs of neurodiversities. Screeching and taking off clothes could be reactions to sensory issues. The throwing petals wrong could be an issue with not being able to pay attention to the correct way that should be done or being distracted going down the aisle.", "Yeah, unless she only has issues for certain situations, sounds like lack of boundaries.\n\nI have ADHD. My impulse control is basically run by a squirrel on crack. I was a better behaved child than that. By miles. Mostly, because while I would push shiny buttons, I did realize that not all buttons are meant to be pushed and if I had more than 10 seconds between thought and action my logical brain starts to override the crack squirrels. I would look like I was about to vibrate out of my seat and wiggle and wiggle and wiggle but wouldn't start busting dance moves. I was just a wiggly little heathen who couldn't focus and would *literally* climb the walls. They had shelves attached.\n\nEverything here is attention-seeking behavior. Throwing petals at people. Jumping up on tables. Dancing at the altar. Grabbing the mic for a poop joke. That is all attention-seeking and the result of everything being funny and cute and never being told how to appropriately engage with adults and appropriate ways to get attention from people. This has been encouraged. Laughing and positive reinforcement through giving her attention and praise and laughter has encouraged this.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't invite the kiddo. She is in no way able to conduct herself in a formal setting. Not being a flower girl isn't going to stop her from being horribly behaved.", "Right -- *maybe* the screeching, if it was when the organ was playing something, or *maybe* the taking off her clothes, also because sensory issues (but that would have happened much earlier in the day and she wouldn't have done it in the middle of the dance floor).\n\nThe behaviors OP describes are a child who is used to being the center of attention and who has never been told \"no.\"\n\nThere is zero evidence of autistic behaviors in OP's description.", "I once went to a rural wedding, all of it at the bride's home, where there was a THREE HOUR gap between the wedding and the reception.  Not sure why, but I didn't stick around.", "Same! It totally blows my mind when people can't understand that just because an impulse is understandable for the age doesn't mean it shouldn't be discouraged. Like yes, kids that age do want to do certain things, but you're supposed to teach them how their actions affect other people and how to deal with those impulses in a way that is healthy and ensures that other people won't avoid them for being antisocial monsters (antisocial in this sense of being hostile or harmful to society instead of just not wanting to be around people).", "Agreed, in fact having an exceptional child places even more importance on firm, but gentle, consistent parenting where they set their child up for success. For example, planning for backup plans, limiting the demand (scope and time) for picture perfect behavior, even bargaining can help but omg the parental consistency better be on point.", "Uch, it is a pet peeve of mine, being on the spectrum might explain some behavior but it does not excuse it\ud83d\ude44 I know it is hard (bc both my kids are, but that just makes me double down on teaching them the right behavior). I hate those parents that use it as an excuse to stop parenting, their kids life will be so hard when they enter the grown-up world", "If her parents do not accept their child might be on the spectrum it certainly means she is not receiving the services that will improve her life. That's neglect. \n\nI would not have any flower girl at the wedding. If just one girl is chosen the bruised feelings can last a lifetime.", "Yes, but the younger, the better. It helps to form neural pathways early, so there\u2019s more time for them to develop. It\u2019s why they advocate for early treatment of neurodivergent disorders because the longer you wait, the harder it is to undo/correct these pathways", "Which is where the parents need to be more supervisory of the behaviours.\n\nI wouldn't have let any of my autistic children behave in the way described. When they used to get overstimulated, I removed them to a place they could be more comfortable, even if it meant that I missed out on the event. Either that or hired a babysitter for the event and have them in their own environment, at home.\n\nI would never have expected them to be included in a wedding party because I knew it would be too difficult for them, and would not have wanted to impact the event.", "Well - it depends! Some kids respond quickly to ABA with the right RBT; others can take longer but it\u2019s absolutely true that the earlier the ABA starts, the better it is for the kid, no matter the level of disability. Better for the kid bc they learn how to let ppl know what they need and want, and safe ways to self-regulate, etc.", "The parents really need to get her diagnosed and get her started in therapy, then, if she is in fact on the spectrum. They're not doing her any favors by ignoring this.", "That honestly depends on how, specifically, their autism manifests. And not all of the child's behaviors at the last wedding are even necessarily due to autism. ALL children need to learn impulse control, and while it can be harder with a child with autism, it is going to depend on a great number of factors. In this situation, it doesn't sound like the girl gets much in the way of discipline at all. Her parents think at least some of it is adorable. She has learned that it's acceptable behavior. Autism or no autism, the girl needs discipline.", ">The throwing of the petals incorrectly\n\nNot the throwing them at people as weapons \n\nFreaking out about tossing out the right number of petals each time, or taking too long by insisting the petals be in a line, yes. Trying to hurt people with them? Not so much.\n\n>he screeching, the taking off of clothing\n\nYes, those are reactions to sensory overload, but not in the way OP said they happened.\n\nThe screeching was followed up with a Fortnite dance performance, so it's questionable that the kid was having a meltdown and then jumped up and made themselves the center of attention by dancing at the front of the church.\n\nAnd if the child took of her clothes because of sensory overload, it likely would have happened much earlier in the day, and the kid would not have made a point of going to the middle of the dance floor to do it.", "Yeah, attention seeking is right. Which is one reason it doesn\u2019t read as autism to me, because while autistic people certainly CAN be attention seeking obviously, they\u2019re more likely to want as little attention as possible in a big social setting. And here it seems evident that this kid has gotten nothing but positive reinforcement from her parents for her attention seeking behavior, so in a sense it\u2019s not a matter of not picking up on social cues or appropriate boundaries. She\u2019s behaving within the parameters that her parents have explicitly encouraged.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt autistic (or ADHD) kids CAN be disruptive but these behaviors don\u2019t fit the profile. These aren\u2019t impulses she has to fight to control. She\u2019s just a ham, who has been told her antics are funny rather than rude and disruptive.", "Yeah, and given she's the center of attention - not being the flower girl might cause more issues.\n\nMy lil cousin is mildly on the ASD spectrum.\n\nHe's more likely to run off and hide behind a bush, popping out, making faces at people and then hiding when they look over and repeating over going and jumping up at the center of the wedding to start dancing. You're more likely to find him under a table than jumping on top of one. He sometimes screeches, but full meltdowns are very rare. Mom is good at knowing he's close to a limit and excusing them from a party or finding him somewhere quiet to sit.\n\nFamily friend has four kids. Three have autism. The middle one might stand up at a wedding and announce to the table that he is leaving to poop and walk off, but not on a microphone. He'd just tell people why he was leaving the table. To poop. Back later. None would bust a dance move or climb on tables. The youngest one is limited verbally and usually writes or uses other methods and is much less likely to do well at a big event and rarely goes to them. They let him skip if he doesn't want to go. He can communicate, just usually not verbally. He is probably the most likely to be disruptive, but also doesn't like... try to make people look and can tell people he doesn't want to go to a wedding or wants to go somewhere else. Has his own system of communication. Oldest wouldn't cause disruptions.\n\nThis just reads like a kid with poor social skills, but due to being told the poor social skills are hilarious. She is picking up what people are telling her. \"Yelling about poop is funny. Keep doing it!\"", "People are really weird about disabled people and their families situations/lives sometimes."]}
