My niece is the only little girl in my family, so it's pretty much expected by the whole family that she will be a flower girl in our wedding. For some background, many members of my family (myself included) think that she is on the autism spectrum, but my sister and BIL refuse to entertain any idea of that being a possibility. I absolutely adore my niece, but after seeing her as the flower girl in my brother's wedding last week I do not want her in mine. \n\nExamples include chucking the flower petals at the guests like she was pitching a major league baseball game, screeching through the entire ceremony, getting up onto the altar and doing a Fortnite dance while they were exchanging their vows, climbing onto the tables during dinner, going to the middle of the dance floor during the wedding party speeches and taking her dress off, and grabbing the microphone to announce that she had to poop.\n\nShe is an only child so my sister and BIL think this is completely normal for her age and that her antics are just THE CUTEST, so it's not easy to ask them to supervise her more closely and to be honest, I don't trust that they would if I asked. I love my niece, but she is out of control in formal settings.\n\nI feel really selfish for thinking that she will ruin my wedding, but I was mad FOR the bride last week and can't imagine how I would feel if it were me. I don't want to upset anyone by not asking her or having to explain why I'm not asking her, and she will still be invited to the wedding so I'm sure there will be some antics, but after discussing it with my fiance we agree that we do NOT want her to be a part of the ceremony.\n\nSo, WIBTA for asking his niece to be our flower girl and excluding my own?", "created_utc": 1694031335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bup58/wibta_if_i_didnt_ask_my_niece_to_be_a_flower_girl/", "score": 487, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The behavior you described is not typical of a three year old at a serious event like a wedding. Good Luck!", "NTA. This girl's parents should have coached and prepared her to be a flower girl.  My daughter was also a flower girl at my sister's wedding at the age of three, and I would have been mortified if she had behaved like that. I would definitely have removed her from the room the moment she began screeching, and when she asked why we were sitting out in the car I would have explained that we weren't going back until she had calmed down. Of course, it never got to that point at the wedding because I had already established standards for public behavior in far less formal situations. It's sad that your sister and BIL are effectively depriving your niece of opportunities by refusing to properly parent her.", "NTA. Do you really need flower girls at all?

Your niece sounds like she\u2019s not been given boundaries and now this is the consequence, at 5 she\u2019s old enough to know better.", "NTA this is why it\u2019s common for a kid free wedding so they can\u2019t ruin everything by screaming", "NTA and a 5 year old should be able to control their behavior better than that.

When my daughter was a flower girl, she was really little and dumped all the flowers in one place rather than spreading them. Things like that are kind of expected. But not what you experienced. The niece who I guess would be better behaved is younger, so to minimize family tension it might be better to skip the flower girl.", "I\u2019d go child free.  The flower girl part is the least of your worries. The ceremony, the reception will still be disrupted if she attends.  In fact, it could be worse if her parents praised her funny behaviour last time", "After the behavior that you witnessed, you are completely NTA to disinvite the 5 year old from your wedding and make the 3 year old your flower girl.

The longer this continues the worse quality of life the child will have", "NTA.\n\nHow about a no flower girl option? I knew someone who got around a similar problem\\*\\* by having a flower cat. How they trained that beastie floof to walk down the aisle with an itty bitty harness remains a slight mystery, but it was SO CUTE.\n\n\\*\\*Their issue wasn't terribly behaved little girls, but too many little girls in the family and the battle ultimately wasn't worth it.

You can have a wedding without one.\n\nIf you really want the 3-yr-old, there's no way around it. \"Little Audrey just isn't ready for a formal wedding. Every child is different.

There, done! And you don\u2019t need to get in a fight over the behavior", "NTA. But if you think the other niece is going to perform perfectly,  you're in for a shock.

They need the honesty.", "NTA I wouldn't even want her at the wedding.", "Either make wedding child free or age limited 8+ making sure to state on invitations and that NO EXCEPTIONS WILL BE MADE or sit sis down and tell her that she either completely controls ALL her child's behavior and you  ABSOLUTELY didn't see anything remotely cute or acceptable in  any of her child's behavior at brothers wedding and that that kind of behavior WILL NOT BE TOLERATED at your wedding and 1 single outburst of any kind and her and her child will be escorted out or she can find child care for her child and not bring her to the wedding. And that her child will not be flower girl and neither of these things are up for discussion, debate, or argument. And you will tell parents and family the same thing if she chooses to whine to family about your decision.", "NTA.\n\nNeice has proven that she cannot behave at weddings or other formal occasions. There's nothing positive to show you that she won't do it again at yours. So, no to being the flower girl and I would say no to the wedding, too, especially if you can't trust the level of supervision that sister and BIL will give.", "Definitely NTA. There is something wrong with parents who tolerate any of that behavior and possibly an issue with the child. I wouldn\u2019t allow her to be a flower girl or even allow her at the wedding unless you were prepared to have someone remove her if she starts to act up.", "YWNBTAH also, child-free weddings are currently the rage.", "You can say we are just having 1 flower girl and since she has already been one, we are making his niece the flower girl.", "NTA but probably less drama if you omit a flower girl altogether. Better still consider a child free wedding or only children older than 10 for example", "I don't think talking to the parents will help. They seems oblivious to what their child's do to other peoples celebration. I would stick to your guns in just keep her as a guest. There may be some hurt feelings, or maybe threats of not coming, but I would still stick to my guns because you don't want that kind of chaos at your wedding.

Lots of my family are on it.  Nothing in her behavior looked like it. But it does look like a totally out of control brat with indulgent, AH parents.  This isn\u2019t to say that she isn\u2019t ND, for other reasons.  She could be. But all the stuff you mentioned isn\u2019t related.  That was just a lack of parenting.

Your niece\u2019s behavior was not okay, but the larger problem is that you sister and BIL are not doing their job as her parents to correct her behavior or get her the support she needs. \n\nI think it would be fine to be honest, Daughter\u2019s behavior was not okay and since you chose not to intervene, she is not invited to the wedding.\u201d But I lean towards blunt, so I understand if you want a more polite way to handle it. Hopefully their daughter attending school will help them realize how bad her behavior is and how much she needs them to intervene.", "NTA, as someone who's Autistic with 2 kids who are both looking that way.

If she is there and they are supervising her just as loosely nothing would stop her doing them. Flower girl dress or not", "NTA. She had a chance to be in that position before and did a bad job and acted a brat, and your sister and BIL are delusional to think that she is okay for acting like that.

I\u2019m am cry laughing. Maybe she is just missing her niche. I\u2019d like to hire her for my divorce party.", "This is the way.  That way you can have a child free wedding.  Otherwise she will probably behave just as badly.  It's sad that the other little one can't come.  However, it sounds as if your niece's worst antics were after she was the flower girl.\n\nPlus, she not only got away with it at the last wedding but she had her parents' approval,  adoration, and \"awww she's so cute!!!\"\n\nYou'd better believe she remembers that and will go for even more wild behavior.", "I did not have a flower girl or ring bearer for just this reason.", "This is a good idea. OP. My family has lots of people on the autism spectrum.  That said, either your sister and bil are just exhausted and too tired to try harder...which could be. ...or maybe struggling with how to proceed and could use helpful suggestions and help....or maybe are just really clueless.  That said, there are things within one's control and things so not.  It is exhausting work. I wonder if that's why they only have one child. \n\nBut eliminating the position completely...removes the situation without having to put you in a place you may not want to be. But eventually you need to feel them out and have this talk. You cannot forever just put it off either.  She will always be your niece and there will always be family gatherings.", "I would choose the no flower girl route too. It\u2019s way too easy for your sis/BIL/niece to feel deliberately excluded if you have your fianc\u00e9\u2019s niece in the wedding and not yours.", "Better yet, have a dog do it. It is much cuter.", "I was the flower girl for one of my dad\u2019s employees when I was 4-ish. I took it very seriously!  I was carefully dropping my flower petals when the son of my dad\u2019s partner stood up on the pew and screamed \u201cHI MISTLETOE\u201d while waving madly at me. \n\nI was horrified!  I was doing my job and he ruined  my big moment because he didn\u2019t know how to behave!!\n\nTurned out that was pretty much how that guy\u2019s life went in the future as well. A portent of things to come\u2026", "This is what I was thinking, even if the 3 year old is normally well behaved, seeing the 5 year old act up might lead her to join in and become a handful too.\n\nRather than talk to the parents, I'd ask them how they felt the wedding last week went. \nMaybe they saw the 5 year olds behavior through new eyes. They must have seen some disapproval on the face of other guests. \n\nNTA, you are paying big money for the day.  Make good memories. \nI hope it all goes smoothly. And, Congratulations!", "Although, being talked to about it is important - just being silently left out is the worst. Better yet would be, we really want you to come but are thinking it might not be the ideal environment for your son. Are we right? What would work best for you?\u2019", "I agree OP is not the asshole but depending what extent if this child is actually autistic sometimes certain behaviors are hard to contain. It\u2019s not always \u201cbad behavior\u201d or being a brat, it could have to do with sensory issues and lack of understanding. Now if she isn\u2019t autistic or neurodivergent then yes her parents are the AH and need to teach their kid some manners", "Yep, I feel sorry for this 5 year old, too. Regardless of what combination of neurodivergence and poor parenting is causing this situation, labelling it cute and normal isn\u2019t helping in the slightest. I teach six and seven year olds and there\u2019s such a big difference - even at that age - between kids with additional needs whose parents are working actively to address their needs versus parents who aren\u2019t. As they get older, the gap gets even worse, and friendships often start to become a significant problem area, because the other kids don\u2019t want to hang out with someone who does whatever they want regardless of its impact on others.", "Cats r/purrrfect", "They is a big difference between not performing perfectly and the behavior that OP described, none of which is age appropriate for a 5 years old.", "It sounds like OP is accepting normal kid mishaps but her niece did a lot more than expected.", "My pastor bribed our flower girl with a candy bar. Worked like a charm.", "Yes. This. \n\nYou certainly don\u2019t have to put up with the antics of a child who isn\u2019t being properly parented.\n\nBut do be aware that even the best behaved children may panic or act out when everyone\u2019s eyes are on them. \n\nInstead of daintily strewing petals down the aisle, our flower girl immediately overturned her pail and violently shook it as hard as she could, yelling at one stubborn petal to \u201cget outta there, little fella!\u201d We thought it was hilarious.", "I understand the urge to avoid conflict, but even if you dodge it this time I foresee lots of issues in your future. The child is out of control and her parents are doing nothing about it. \n\nFamily meeting time. Sister and BIL, and your parents and fianc\u00e9. Maybe even your brother and SIL as they would be able to back you up. Statements coming from you so no blame falls on your fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst point of discussion: you already had concerns about having your niece as flower girl, and her behaviour at your brother\u2019s wedding has cemented that for you. If brother and SIL want to chime in with how they felt about her behaviour, now\u2019s the time to do it. Flower girl is permanently off the table. \n\nMake it clear that you were appalled by her behaviour, but even more appalled that her parents did nothing about it. You are NOT putting up with a repeat performance at your wedding. \n\nWhat is now up for debate is whether she\u2019s allowed to attend at all. Clearly identify what \u201cunacceptable behaviour\u201d means to you and your fianc\u00e9 (she is still a kid, so perfect behaviour isn\u2019t realistic). The moment child breaks the agreement, child and at least one of her parents will be immediately escorted off the property. \n\nYour aim in this discussion is to make clear what you will and won\u2019t accept. Your sister and BIL don\u2019t have to agree with your assessment - your event, your rules. You are giving them a courtesy heads up so they know what to expect. Let them know you\u2019ll have security keeping an eye on them specifically (whether hired or friends roped in as brat wranglers).\n\nExpectations. Consequences.\n\nETA your sister, her husband and your parents may be extremely unhappy with you. That\u2019s ok. She needs to know.", "I agree... I cant imagine any of the austistic kids I know grabbing a microphone... Its usually the opposite, too much attention is overwhelming, which leads to a meltdown.", "No, 5y/o should not be invited at all. It's clear she cannot behave, and her parents refuse to supervise. It's not fair to OP to have the same chaos that ensued at the previous wedding.", "I believe you are missing the N? Your explanation seems to lend to NTA", "\"lighten up eh? She's a kid.\"  THat is bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKinds don't behave that way, because they have parents who are not AHs and actually do some parenting.", "The child is acting like an absolute urchin. Your mentality is how these entitled kids with 0 respect are created in the first place. Next is an autism label slapped onto the kid as a bandaid for poor parenting.", "The niece in question is 5. Old enough to know how to behave.", "This seems real brother. Autistic people have real problems. If this is true then this is a cause for concern.", "One disruption is different from several, throughout the wedding ceremony and reception. It sounds like it just never stopped.", "But back to the co-flower girl thing, can a 3 year old handle it alone??", "Not climbing on the altar during the vow exchange, that's for sure ...\n\nIf this was all during the dancing/party part of the reception, then it would have been okay. A bit much, but it's just a kid having fun with everyone else. But she disrupted the ceremony, dinner, AND speeches. Completely inappropriate. \n\nThis isn't a flower girl issue. She shouldn't even be at the wedding if this is normal behavior for her, and she isn't even being properly supervised.", "Except she\u2019ll still do that climbing tables shit as a guest. Parents should be told she\u2019s not invited. Consequences for behavior.", "Yeah, I had to triple-check that age - if she was 2, I would have been like \"Yeah, you can tell her that it's not nice to do those things but sometimes 2-year-olds gonna 2 year old\", but she's 5! I mean, even at 2, the parents should have grabbed her when she did some of those things, but at 5, she's old enough to know not to do these things, and her parents should know that it's not cute at all.\n\nI kinda hope that OP does have the other kid as a flower girl and explains to her sister why this choice is being made. It will create issues, but they are going to raise the *most* annoying adult. 5yos become bratty teenagers quickly, and then they quickly become adults that nobody wants to be around. Sister and BIL are setting their daughter up for failure.", "Or, no kids under 8, so the problem kid is omitted, but it doesn't look targeted.", "She\u2019s three but her behavior is atypical for her age", "That or the girls parents would have such glee at how much more personality the 5 yo  has than the 3 yo.\nIf her parents have enabled and  beamed approval at grotesque behavior in the past, they will enable rd it in the future.\n\nI would tell them the kids behavior is so far beyond acceptable at a wedding you can't afford to risk a repeat performance", "Yep, this. If your other niece is 3 she\u2019s not going to care about being a flower girl and it\u2019s easier to just avoid the problem altogether", "The other niece is 3 years old. You think a 3 year old is going to care, or even remember that she was or wasn't a flower girl?", "To be honest , it sounds more like ADHD than being on the spectrum if anything. I do agree that it is mostly the parents not setting boundaries for behavior from the sounds of things. NTA", "Yeah this kid is like Lilly on Modern Family when she kept saying \u201cfuck\u201d because it made Cam laugh. Her parents need to do a better job working on impulse control and inside voice. Spare yourself a headache and dealing with entitled  parents , hurt feelings and just have a kid free wedding.", "So you feel entitled to diagnose someone you\u2019ve never met? We have no idea why here she\u2019s on the spectrum or not but the Op and her family feel she likely is and I would tend to accept their view", "OP\u2019s niece has had the opportunity to be a flower girl already, apparently solo. Why not allow the other child the same opportunity?", "https://youtu.be/dFGzKQ5c-Sc?si=qCkdlKCrKdyrMkpb", "My stepdaughter had a flower teenager (17f, groom\u2019s niece).", "The child isn\u2019t going to care\u2026.mom and dad on the other hand will have a fit if the 3 y/o is a flower girl and their \u201cprincess\u201d 5 y/o isn\u2019t", "The flower girl issue is only part of the problem.  This girl already ruined one wedding, she shouldn't be allowed to ruin another, but the parents refuse to act.", "That works for me but that doesn't work on some family. Most mom's would instantly latch onto that olive branch 'what works for you' and attend to be 'inclusive'. A.k.a. find another relative teenager and have a break from their child. Seriously; I've seen it happen too many times. \n\nIt's not about what works for me or my son. I genuinely understand we're not wanted for certain events. Make sure to have a visit and small gathering (less formal) for the same reasons, with me and my son, and we're perfect. Example is come over for a nice dinner or BBQ to celebrate your marriage.", "Yes! We used Froot Loops for my bff\u2019s 3 year old nephew when he was the ring bearer. Worked perfectly.", "That\u2019s a lot different than a kid not being held accountable by their parents when disrupting speeches and stripping down", "Oops, thank you. I've corrected that.", "She's 3. Lol. Three year olds are babies. Yikes, relax.", "Ok you might have a point, the taking off the dress and screeching might be a bit much", "Old enough to know better \u2260 old enough to control the impulse. Which means, young enough to need more active supervision and redirection.", "Even if she is two, those are all things the parents can stop before they happen. Or, maybe 80 percent because I know you can't stop everything. But if your 2 yo starts getting squirmy during a ceremony, it's probably time to bring her to the back, or even out of the room, before she can cause more problems. (I had my own 2 yo at my wedding. My SIL managed her and somehow she was there when we needed her and not there when she was getting antsy!)", "She's 5, not 3", "Ugh yeah you have a point.", "Exactly my thoughts.  There's no need to worry about hurting a 3 year olds feelings. Don't even bring up flower girls when discussing your wedding with anyone so you don't have to explain or feel awkward.  And don't tell anyone else or it will get back to them.", "Or remember anything at all about being 3.", "Not trying to hijack this but I was a flower girl for my moms brother's daughter at about this age and although I dont remember it I still have the purse I kept the flowers in and some dried rose petals from that day and love having that memory. This family member watched me a lot growing up so we are rather close besides a 25 year age difference. It might not make a core memory but I know it means a lot to me. Im almost 24 now and know exactly where that puse is in my memory box and want the flower girl at my wedding to use it. So it could go either way for the 3 year old", "I remember being forced to be a flower girl at that age\u2026.probably because I had strep throat and felt like trash and literally laid down on the steps of the alter to take a nap because my fever was so high. But still. No kid that she wants to be in a wedding. It\u2019s all about the adults who want it. Not the kid.", "My cousin got married back in April, and his sister and her wife had his 3 year old niece as the flower girl. Granted, she looked absoutely adorable, but she got one look at the crowd when the doors opened for them to walk in the room, and noped right out of that! Hung back pulling on their hands, trying to escape. Eventually they carried her down the aisle and she was fine, but these things are often overwhelming for a kid that age. Easier to just not have one and avert the possibility of a meltdown from either of them, spectrum or not.\n\nOP - NTA", "Yes, my daughter was 3 in my wedding and remembers being the flower girl.", "I knew my daughter had ADHD by the time she was 2. She never behaved like that because I taught her better.", "It is still a spectrum of neurodivergence.", "Yeah, no. Don't be bringing ADHD into this. I'm the eldest of 4 kids, all with varying types/severity of ADHD . This is not ADHD behavior. I can't speak on the autism aspect, but this is primarily bad parenting, especially if they think it's cute.", "The kiddo may be autistic or have ADHD but about half of these are just bad behavior.", "That works, too.", "And ENFORCE the kid-free part.", "I didn\u2019t \u201cdiagnose\u201d anyone.  OP said that many people in the family think that the niece is on the spectrum.  It\u2019s right there in the post if you don\u2019t believe me.

Some events, super expensive adult parties for example, are just not well suited for children, autistic or not.", "Going places without your children some times is ok. You havn't seen it happen \"too many times\" because it is not a problem. And yes that includes \"autistic level 3 individuals\". They might not want to be with someone else but sometimes they have to be. \n\nCarers burn out and having a life of their own is absolutely healthy and advised. Hell a professional would be *required*  to have respite cover sometimes.\n\nAnd to be completely morbid getting them used to the idea that they never have to be with anyone else wont help in the long run, when you die.", "Of course it\u2019s different. Which is why I said OP doesn\u2019t have to put up with that nonsense.", "Absolutely! And if she's on the spectrum, like her family thinks (which I hadn't noticed on frist read), then it's even harder for her to control her impulses. Unfortunately, if her parents are treating these behaviours as \"cute\", she's never going to learn to control her impulses and this is going to get a lot worse. That's why I think the parents knowing why she's not going to be a flower girl would help in the long run, even if it would cause short-term pain (and probably a lot of it) - they need a wakeup call so they can provide that more active supervision and redirection.", "Yep - piffing the flower petals at people probably wasn't something the parents could stop, but taking her out when she shrieked during the ceremony, not letting her run onto the alter during vows, grabbing her from the dancefloor when she was going to take her dress off? These are all things parents should be doing to control their toddlers. If their 5yo is doing it, it's because they're not stopping it from happening.", "Do you not?", "I have very specific memories of being two years old. People do remember.  Not caring about being in the wedding is more likely.  It will matter (or not) to the 3 year old depending on if her parents make it into a thing.  She doesn\u2019t have flower girl expectations at that age unless someone gives her them and reminds her regularly.", "All four of my children inherited my ADHD and one also inherited my HFA. There was some impulse control issues, especially with my youngest but when  they reared up, I intervened and redirected.", "Yep. Came to say this.", "You said \u2018 I don\u2019t agree she\u2019s on the spectrum\u2019 . You said she was a brat.

Glad you have an excuse to get out of socializing!", "I do. That's not the same thing as a family formal event where I get to pick and choose if I attend.\n\nMy son goes to school, therapy, swim class, has his own friends and own life.
