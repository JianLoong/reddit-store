That being said her statement is in all fairness a completely stupid and short sighted thing to say and feel. My brother is 3 years younger than me and we\u2019ve been best friends our whole lives. I appreciate that\u2019s the age gap isn\u2019t quite the same as you and yours but it truly makes no difference, her comparing herself and your friends of a similar age to your own brother as the rightful candidate of who should be your best friend is backwards.
