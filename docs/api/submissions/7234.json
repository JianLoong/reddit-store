My friend, who also work in sales was transferred to my husband's current retail outlet and now they are together there for two days. Me and my friend met each other this morning, and to my surprise, she asked me if I know who Daisy is. So I answered her, yes and that we've seen each other on some occassions. She then told me with hesitation, that Daisy and my husband are always together in the store, eating and smoking together. The thing is, I've known it for a long time but last Dec.25 my husband told me(without me asking) that he will avoid Daisy so it came as a surprise. Before, I thought they were in a relationship because they always call each other to eat and smoke together (I checked his call history before) but when we were together on some occasions my husband always called her sister or elder sister. I know they are only friends but their closeness bothers me. I explained to my husband that their closeness is wrong and that he already has a wife but he doesn't understand me. And to add to this, my friend also told me that the three of them smoked together and my husband asked my friend if she wanted tea but she refused. Then Daisy said, we'll just share one cup. AND THEY DID SHARE! I also informed my husband that I know about it but he acts like he did nothing wrong. He even said that my friend overreacted and I am trusting my friend more than him.

Boundaries make good friends as fences make good neighbours.", "NTA\n\nOkay, this judgment is totally being written with 80% certainty that I understood this. Please put paragraphs because some of this was a tad confusing \n\nBut you can't tell your husband that having a wife means he can't have female friends. I feel like that's a big generalization and misses why *this* particular friendship makes you uncomfortable. \n\nHowever, I think your husband is an AH for lying (?) about the time he spends with her. Sharing a cup if there are others is weird and I probably would feel weird about it too.\n\nI also think its important to note that your friend seeing this and bringing it to you puts you in an uncomfortable situation. My partner and I have always agreed that, aside from obviously not cheating, we would never put ourselves in situations where our relationship with others can be reasonably perceived as crossing a line. Because it can put our partner in an uncomfortable space. I think thats a reasonable boundary to say \"hey, I am happy you have a work friend, but you cannot treat her in a manner that someone might treat an SO. I do not want people coming to me thinking that you're crossing a line. I do not want to hear that you are sharing a cup or anything similar.\"\n\nDaisy and him could have nothing romantic going on. But explicitly cheating is *not* the only way to disrespect a relationship. Creating situations where the behavior is akin to how romantic partners may behave can be crossing a boundary and it is normal to assert and expect that. But you have to communicate that better.", "INFO: Did he say he would avoid her unprompted?

This is a sticky situation but it seems like you aren\u2019t insecure and he really is just being a little too close with Daisy. I would feel uncomfortable about this too if I had a husband or a boyfriend. His and her behavior doesn\u2019t sit right with me at all. I do have a question, does he call her sister so you won\u2019t suspect he is talking to her or she sees her as a sister? Anyways I think if you feel uncomfortable it would be good of him to take a step back from her because you should he the priority. After all you are his wife. If he can\u2019t understand that you should probably rethink your values in your relationship with him. What is most important to you in the relationship? Good luck and let me know what you decide to do.", "NTA - could be nothing, but go with your gut.  The old phrase \"Trust but Verify\" comes to mind.", "For starters, don't go through your husbands phone, immediate breach of trust.\n\nSecondly, why did he say he would avoid Daisy unprompted?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with two people of different genders hanging out a lot, you can't stop your husband from having female friends. That being said, sharing a single cup of tea is just plain weird.\n\nI dunno if your friend is making things up for whatever reason since this all came from her, but if it's real, your husband needs to not do weird shit like sharing a cup with well, anyone. That's bizarre. You're definitely TA for going through his phone though.\n\nIf he's close with a work colleague and you're bothered by it, that's something for YOU to work on. If it gets to the point where he starts putting her before you or becoming more distant with you and even closer to her, then you have cause for concern.", "NTA - If you expressed to your husband that his relationship with Daisy makes you uncomfortable and he's brushed you off and continued, you're not wrong for being suspicious. He clearly hasn't set boundaries with this person and doesn't care for your boundaries regarding his behaviour.

Either there truly is nothing going on, and when they are eating/smoking together, it's just because they're \"work friends\" who see each other a lot at work, and are friends because of it.

Are you being a bit overcautious?  Possibly, but not unreasonably so.  And it sounds like the husband isn't actually doing anything altogether wrong here (yet) either.  Maybe sit down with your husband and explain why the situation makes you nervous, how you want to trust him, but have concerns, and how your friend is just trying to look out for your best interests.  \n\nGood luck OP!

I get that you\u2019re married but god damn. To your knowledge there has been no infedility nor is there any proof of such a thing. You mentioned they only hang out at work and that there\u2019s no evidence they\u2019re seeing each other outside of work. You\u2019re already treating him like he\u2019s cheated/cheating. I understand emotional cheating is a thing, as well\u2026 but there isn\u2019t even any evidence of that. \n\nYou\u2019re taking this friend\u2019s word, which I totally get. But you also don\u2019t know if anything is being embellished at all. Does this friend have any history of gossip or stretching the truth?\n\nI don\u2019t see an issue with sharing a beverage with someone. I have friends that I do that with. How long have they been friends? Since before you were married or even met? Or only just recently? I can see it being an issue if you are forcing him to give up a friendship he\u2019s had for a long time, especially if they make his work days bearable to chill with them. I know they\u2019re of the opposite gender and your concerns are normal\u2026 but again, there\u2019s not evidence of any sort of funny business going on (yet). Innocent until proven guilty. \n\nLet\u2019s get to what he said. He said he would try and avoid her voluntarily. So it also seems as though he is not hiding this friendship from you. It\u2019s only now recently that he\u2019s said he would try and avoid her that there\u2019s issues. Maybe he is actively trying. It can be hard to completely cut off a friend, especially when you have a great camaraderie with them. It\u2019s another thing entirely when you\u2019re being forced to cut off a friend by someone. I get you\u2019re his wife but from everything you\u2019ve said so far\u2026 you\u2019re monitoring his calls and his location constantly\u2026 that can\u2019t feel good knowing he\u2019s being scrutinized for every location and call. Maybe he feels as though he has to hide the fact he\u2019s hanging out with this person because you\u2019re trying to control who he is able to be friends with. You are still the person he comes home to every night and spends time with doing literally everything else\u2026 why is it a huge deal to have a coworker you enjoy having lunch with? \n\nYou don\u2019t mention it in your post, but if he\u2019s neglecting you in his duties as a husband, then that\u2019s different. If he\u2019s prioritizing her over you always then yes, that\u2019s an issue. But from the limited information you gave in your post\u2026 he isn\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m not saying his actions are justified\u2026 but try and see things from his perspective, as well. Until there\u2019s some evidence of actual infidelity or \u2018meetups\u2019, I don\u2019t see why this is a huge deal\u2026 them having lunch and smoking at work. \n\nIf you provide more info, maybe my stance will change.", "YTA just for checking your husbands call history out of bullshit insecurity.", "Yta insecurity isn't a good look.

Right?", "Hold on, when you say smoking together, are you talking about smoke breaks at work, or like they are getting together privately with the friend to \"smoke\" a particular herb?\n\nThe former is absolutely normal for workplace friends. The thing with the tea sounds a little odd..\n\nIt may be innocent, but definitely would talk to the husband. You do sound somewhat insecure.\n\nNAH without more info", "NTA as you have very valid reason, especially because he promised you that they wouldn't be friends anymore, and because many, many people have been betrayed like this before. Also, I've been cheated on by an ex when I've been told \"it's just a friend\" so I get it. \n\nBut as someone that's been ONLY friends with a guy and has been accused of it being more before- it IS possible that they're just friends. I will give you my POV.\n\nI have been in this situation two times: 1st situation, it was my friend of 10+ years and his wife wanted no contact as back in the day, over 6 years ago, we had a short fling that didn't work out. I told him I'd happily offer to hang out with her, to chat, to reassure her, and even hang out with BOTH of them every time I'd hang out with him, happily become her friend too...nothing would sway her. She's convinced that I would steal him, even though I'd happily tell her that I do not want him \ud83d\ude05 He's allowed to text me from time to time just to ask how I am, but she refuses to allow for us to hang out even with her being present. I understand where she's coming from bc how many times do we hear and know and experience stories about cheating, but I just want our friendship back. I was thrilled that he finally found his person and gets to be a dad, but it just makes me sad that I can never hang out with my friend. It is what it is. \n\n2nd situation (and more relevant to yours), I had a coworker \"husband\" - he was an AH and said many sarcastic things and it just made me laugh all the time, and I gave it right back, so we got along really well. I was friends with his GF (basically wife) too, and at first, she was cool with it, but over time, she got more jealous about it. She used to allow for us to hang out separately (which only happened once on the way to work when I needed a ride & we lived in the same area, so it's not like it was going to become a habit), but I think from coworkers fueling that fire, she told him to not speak to me as much & avoid me. He'd come around to chat but only with another coworker around and if she was nearby, he wouldn't speak to me at all. Although that also sucked, I understood what was happening, and in a work environment, I wasn't trying to make it super weird or awkward. I also backed off, even though she said she was \"totally fine!\" She was NOT fine, and I later heard she was talking a lot behind my back. She did it to everyone though, so I didn't even take it personally, but needless to say, I stopped being friends with her \ud83d\ude05 I then left that job for a better one a couple of months later, so that was the end of that. \n\nI understand all sides here, and you're def NTA for being concerned. Neither is your friend bc she's looking out for you. Giving your husband benefit of the doubt that he's not cheating, he IS still a bit of TA because he lied to you about not being close to her anymore. If I were you, with my experiences, I would speak to him and make it clear that it is not ok to lie to you, that needs to be honest and that he needs to share everything relating to her. With the work \"wife\", I'd go to her, talk to her and see what she's about. I'd personally become friends with her too so that you van have more eyes on the situation, but that's more so my personal opinion.", "ESH.  You are an AH for going through his phone, unless he gave you permission.   Your husband is an AH, because you have made it clear that his actions bother you and he is not doing anything about it. Even to promising he was going to avoid her, but that obviously went by the wayside pretty quickly.    \n\n\n My experience as a man working retail is it can be hard.  For about 5 of the 8 years I worked retail, I was the only male manager in the store.  I developed \"work\" friendships with many women.  Your husband may not have any choice if he wants to be at sociable at work.", "Their relationship is tripping alarm bells for a neutral third party. Your friend was uncomfortable telling you this, but thought you should know. And your husband has been lying about cutting contact. Something isn\u2019t right there. NTA. I\u2019m so sorry.", "YTA\n\nIf he says he isn't cheating on you, you either accept that or you don't. What you shouldn't do is obsess over it as if he is and then get this damn neurotic. Everyone here is saying this man is cheating and NTA. The real issue is how you're dealing with it. Either dump him and move on or back off and let him work and be friends with whoever he wants. \n\nOr just keep having your friend spy on him and then keep getting yourself worked up enough that you come online and ask what to do.", "Nta. Partners are allowed to set boundaries for each other. There are ways of behaving that threaten a relationship even if they are innocent in themselves.", "NTA because you\u2019ve told him it makes you uncomfortable and he\u2019s ignoring you / lying to you. \n\nIt is possible that they are actually just friends though. Sharing a cup of tea is literally no big deal whatsoever, and your wife can\u2019t be your only friend. This mentality of \u2018men and women can\u2019t be friends\u2019 is exactly what stops men and women from seeing each other as humans that they can be friends with, and pushes them to see each other as sexual targets. \n\nIt sounds to me like your husband is insensitive and your friend is a stirrer, but there\u2019s really no evidence your husband is having \u2018an emotional affair\u2019 as other commenters are suggesting. It would be weird not to be friends with someone you spend all day with, and a cup of tea is literally just a cup of tea\u2026", "Nta\n\nHe unprovoked said he\u2019d end his friendship with her and then went behind your back. You\u2019ve expressed how uncomfortable you are with their friendship and told him your boundaries, he chose her over you. He lied to you and is now gaslighting you. If they haven\u2019t cheated already, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they will in the future.", "Or maybe OP can just ask her husband straight up if he's cheating? Because until that happens all she has is speculation and her friend spying on him. Honestly, if my wife thought I was cheating on her with someone at work I would want her to ask me. And if she didn't believe me I would prefer to split up rather than spend the rest of my life trying to convince her otherwise.", "I even told him that. But said he is doing wrong.", "I mean, he can have female friends and I know he does apart from Daisy but what bothers me is their closeness. He can't even call me to ask what's up but can call Daisy to eat together. There was also this instance where we were celebrating our baby's baby shower (Daisy was there.) and when Daisy decided to go home, he went with her outside to hail her a cab. Not even asking if I want to come with them and hail her a cab despite knowing I am jealous of her.", "Side note, I don\u2019t think your friend has anything to benefit from telling you the truth, if anything she could lose you as a friend if you reacted differently. If you husband is being deceitful he has everything to lose by telling the truth.", "Hard disagree. \n\nIf you're in a monogamous relationship, you can have friends but you have to have boundaries for how you act. If you are acting in a way that not only has made your partner uncomfortable, but also in a way that makes others around you suspicious of your relationship with another woman, then you're crossing a line.\n\nHes treating Daisy like a gf. He doesnt need to cheat for his behavior towards another woman to be disrespectful.", "They don't. I've seen his locations on google map and all he did was home, work, home work. But I know there is a washroom there where apparently a couple \"can have sex\" I know this because I had a friend who did that.", "Saying he eats with a group of friends, but he\u2019s actually just eating with her means there is something to hide & he understands this. He knows he isn\u2019t doing the right thing, even if nothing physical has happened. Even if he knows nothing is there & thinks you\u2019re overreacting, breaking your trust in him is incredibly damaging to the relationship. An external relationship isn\u2019t worth this kind of damage to his primary relationship.", "He knows that I go through his phone from time to time. He also goes through mine sometimes.", "*nothing wrong", "Thats how you need to communicate it. Not that its the fact that they are friends, but the actual nature of their friendship. \n\n\"There should be no relationship that you have (especially with another woman) that causes you to behave in a way that makes me feel less important.\"\n\n\"There should be no relationship that you have with another woman that causes others to be suspicious due to how you both act.\"\n\nHe is treating Daisy like a gf. If you *and* others know it, there is definitely a problem. He doesnt have to be cheating yet at all, but hes creating a situation where romantic feelings could blossom and that, in and of itself, is highly disrespectful to you and I think you should be firm in this.", "Oh there are absolutely boundaries, don't get me wrong, but I'm just considering that we don't know the total picture here. The friend might be exaggerating the closeness for all we know.\n\nDefinitely agree that telling her that he'll avoid Daisy, then not avoiding her and then also sharing a cup (???) is a bad sign and definitely crossing a boundary. My badly explained point was that you can't ask your husband to not have female friends, which is kinda how I felt OP was slightly leaning into. \n\nShe should definitely ask about the cup thing and why he lied about avoiding her though, those are definite signs to look into.", "In that case, I'm going up update my original comment with my judgement.", "I think your last paragraph had thrown me off because it sounded like you were implying her discomfort with closeness to a female colleague was her problem. A certain level of closeness is inappropriate", "Yeah, I can see how that can come off the wrong way. I stand by the idea of it but obviously only up to a certain extent: Friendly chat with a colleague vs. constant calls and *sharing a cup*. That bit is still on my mind it's so odd.", "I think the line is definitely crossed if your partner expresses any sort of discomfort *and* others noticed. I feel like, with both of those, it sounds like hes treating Daisy the way someone treats a person they're romantically interested in."]}
