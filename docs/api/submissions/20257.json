After my husband passed, Juan orginized the flat beds to get his boxes home, helped make room in the garage, and started looking after my car (oil changes, tires at cost, etc). He showed me the name tag from one of my husbands uniforms he ripped off and carried in his wallet. \n\nAnyways, I found out he was saving up for a snap on box (no tools in it), and had about 7k. I sold him all of my husbands tools, less what I might use around the house for what he had saved up. \n\nMy sister in law was pissed.

You do what you feel is right with the gifts and don\u2019t let your greedy sister who is looking for free gifts so she doesn\u2019t have to spend money on your nieces have them at all, remember no is a complete sentence and my condolences to you, I still grieve for my mum even though it\u2019s been 9 months since she died and it still feels like she passed yesterday.", "Anyone else want to join me in telling some relatives to STFU and get out of OP's house? NTA.", "Your mom and your sister should keep their opinions to themselves. You're grieving, and what you do with the presents is up to you.

You're the one who's grieving, and she was your daughter. You do whatever brings comfort to you and helps you feel at peace. Best wishes to you, sir.

You have every right to feel this way. That's actually disgusting they'd ask you to do that.", "This post is beautiful. To the point, and what needs to be said.\n\nOP- I am so very sorry for your loss. Hugs. Please do what you choose to do with the gifts- if donating them in your daughter\u2019s honour brings you happy tears and a smile to your heart, then that\u2019s what you should do.

The children there would appreciate them and you would know they are being used by kids who need to feel like kids, not patients. \n\nAs far as you family, they are absolutely horrible. This is their niece/granddaughter. They should be focused on helping you through this, not wondering what they can get out of your daughter passing. Vile is too kind of a word for either of them. I would have kicked them both out, and tell them they are not welcome at the funeral, then lock all of the gifts in your car to take to the hospital when you are ready.", "This is just bad advice. Not only has OP lost his daughter but now you'd like him to air his family grievances which are in direct relation to his daughter's passing over social media? Grow up, please. That's a horrendous way to go about things and a surefire way to lose the rest of your family.\n\nOP, you are NTA. Your family are being very selfish and quite rude and I'd advise maybe going no-contact for a little bit while you grieve in whichever way you need to grieve. My honest condolences.", "Take allll the time you need and when ready read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3) Ive reread it and shared it often.\n\n\n\n\"Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\"", "Please accept this virtual hug from a stranger. Your mother and sister are vultures, and if they bring it up again, please call them that. Maybe that will snap them out of their selfish mindset. \n\nThey should be pouring love and support into you right now, because you are the epicentre of the pain and loss.

And she wanted my house, that I'm still living in, for a grandson and his girlfriend. I blocked her everywhere I could and stopped answering the phone.
