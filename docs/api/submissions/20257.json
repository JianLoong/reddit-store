We were going to make a picture board and slide show for her funeral. After we started working on both my sister noticed the presents and asked if my daughter ever opened them.

Maybe after some time goes by you'll be ready to part with them but not right now. It's totally understandable that you're not emotionally ready to be giving your daughter's stuff away. Doesn't matter if she hadn't opened them yet or not, the emotional symbolism is huge. \n\nI'm so very sorry for your loss, and that your family are being less than supportive.", "I am so sorry for your loss; this must be an incredibly difficult time.\n\nIt is too soon for you to decide what you want to do with these items, you need tome to grieve.\n\nYour family should not have asked/demanded for your daughter's belongings, while she didn't open them, they were still hers.\n\nWhen you are ready to do something with them, do what feels right.\n\nNTA", "NTA; find a grief counselor or therapist to speak with. I know it's hard, but it does help. Your mother and sister being that interested in your daughters things so soon after her death is just a bit sickening.", "NTA - it would be strange seeing the gifts meant for your daughter in someone else's hands.  Donate them.", "NTA. OMG, it was so rude to interfere in your daughter's memories and things. You can do with them whatever you are comfortable. It's your personal way to honor her.", "NTA holy crap your family is clueless\n\nSorry for your loss", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, your family need to back off and let you make the choices that feel best for you", "NTA\n\neveryone grieves in their own way, they can ask you to give your daughter's presents to her cousins/other family but ultimately they are now yours to do with as you see fit. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss, no parent should have to bury their child \ud83e\udd0d", "NAH - very sorry for your loss and I get where you are coming from but I also can't say I blame your mom and sister for their feelings - really, we are talking about items your daughter never even saw so it isn't like they are trying to stake a claim on a personal, sentimental item like a security blanket, necklace, what have you. But I also won't call you the AH for feeling attached to ANYTHING that could make you feel closer to your daughter.", "NTA. you just lost your daughter if you want to keep the gifts for ANY reason you should feel like your are able to. people grieve in different ways and if you are not wanting the gifts to go the nieces and instead to the hospital I think that's a wonderful thing to do. NTA", "NTA.\n\nOP, I am so sorry for your loss. May your daughter rest in peace and paradise.\n\nYou have every right to decide what do you with your daughters belongings, including the presents she hadn't opened that were meant for her, and decide when to do it. Go through this grieving process as healthily as you can, seek help when you need to, and  don't let anyone invalidate your thoughts and emotions.", "NTA This has got to be one of the saddest aita posts I\u2019ve ever read. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. I feel like donating them to the hospital that your daughter spent her final days, is a beautiful gesture. Maybe even asking if you could \u201cdonate\u201d a toy box as well and have a small marker put on it in memory of her. A lot of hospitals would love that type of donation and you would feel happy knowing another child going through it, could be smiling and enjoying the toys.", "*Let me make myself perfectly clear.  You are not going to make me feel bad about how I choose to grieve my daughter's death.  If donating these things in her honor helps me, then that is what I am going to do.  The fact that you would attempt to make me feel bad right now...like I would be a bad person for donating these things instead of gifting them to your daughters who are still on this earth with you, while mine is gone forever.  I can honestly say I have never been more disappointed in any human being than I am right now in the two of you.  And frankly, I don't want to see or hear from either of you for a while.  You both need to get the hell away from me before I say something I can never take back.*\n\nNTA", "**NTA**\n\nOp, I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nYou are allowed to grieve in whichever way you want, and the second you said you weren't comfortable with it, they should have listened to you. I, a stranger on the internet, can completely understand the feeling and pain you may experience seeing your nieces play with things that were your daughters but that she never got the chance to even open. \n\nYour family is being incredibly selfish putting any kind of demand on her belongings within 4 days of her passing. I am biting my tongue and holding back language, but just know that a lot worse things could be said about them justly.", "NTA. How incredibly heartless and greedy of your sister and family!", "NTA just ew. Ew that they would push to do anything with your daughter's birthday gifts. You don't have to decide anything right now about them and I cannot believe your mom and sister could be so crass", "NTA!  They have a lot of nerve even asking!  You may want to hold on to those gifts for a little while or a long time.  Donate them to a charity your daughter would have chosen when you are ready.  I am so very sorry for your loss.  I hope the wonderful memories you have with your daughter brings you some measure of comfort.  Hugs.", "NTA, if my mom and sister had the nerve to talk about something like this after my child died I'd be NC. What in the world is wrong with them.", "NTA how on earth was that their first response?! Why is had their thought gone to monetary value. \n\nMy Dad passed away less than two years ago and we still have his shoes by the back door. We have only just started donating his clothes to Hospice charities. \n\nI am so so sorry for your loos. You deserve to grieve in peace and without judgement.", "NTA I would also donate them to the hospital in your daughter's memory. It's your family being selfish", "NTA\n\nThe gifts are just things. What's important is handling them in a manner that will best allow you to cope with the loss of your daughter. If that means giving them to other ill children, do that. If that means giving them to her cousins, do that. If you need them to sit in your living room for awhile before you make a decision, that's okay too.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
