We started dating over 2 years ago and I met her family on their first visit to the college and they included me in lunch. Ever since I have kept in regular contact with them and when they visit Ember, they make sure they spend some time with me as well. They are really awesome people and have made me feel so included. They even buy me gifts for my birthday and Christmas.\n\nEmber and I moved in together in July and her family flew out to help us set up. They were so incredibly helpful to us and they invited us to Christmas dinner at that point. I say us but I really mean me since Ember goes to them anyway. It meant so much to me and I immediately said yes.\n\nMy mom was bothered by it when I told her and she put pressure on me to change my mind and go \"home\" right up until Christmas. I always told her I was going to Ember's family and never wavered or made this unclear to her. She just assumed I would choose her anyway.\n\nSo there's some background to this I should explain right here. I come from a \"blended\" family. I say \"blended\" because it really wasn't very well blended lol. My mom had me, met my stepdad when I was 2 or 3. He was a widower with a 6 and 8 year old. They got married. They also had two children together. My mom's family were never part of my life. They were in and out of jail for various things so mom didn't include them. I never knew my father or his family. My stepdad's family never saw me as one of their own. My stepsiblings had family from their mom's side who were very involved too. And growing up I always felt very out of place and like I didn't belong anywhere. My step and half siblings all had at least one set of grandparents who adored them and they had a great relationship with. I had no extended family. My stepsiblings never saw me as their brother and were distant. I was around both stepdad's family and his first wife's family and I always felt awkward. I was overlooked. Any inclusion was lesser than full inclusion other kids in the family had. I got it, especially with my stepsiblings family, but it would have been easier to stay at home. My mom never really got it or had much to say about it and my stepdad was never someone I felt I could talk to.\n\nAnyway, going home was not something I felt good about because I normally had to see all these people who didn't really want me. Christmas 2022 was rough for that very reason. I loved my Christmas with Ember's family though. Mom was so pissed at me for choosing to go there instead of home. She said we're not married yet and we're still so young we should be with our own family for Christmas. I told her I went there because I actually feel like I'm part of the family instead of being around a huge extended \"blended\" family where nobody fucking wants me. My mom told me that wasn't fair and she always wants me and so do my siblings. She told me I was saying things to be hurtful and that was unfair.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704276175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xfwk7/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_went_to_my_girlfriend/", "score": 251, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be warned that she might confront you about this, and demand to know why you \"never told her\" before. If you are willing and it won't hurt you worse, be prepared with a list of examples of being left out that she was present for, and any times you brought it up to her before. The gaslighting is almost guaranteed. Good luck and Ember's family sounds awesome.", "Welp, sounds like your mum has some narcissistic trsits by making herself the victim and making everything about her feelings, absolutely ignoring yours.\n\nBe where you feel the happiest, be with Ember and her family.\n\nBTW I get part of what you feel, my MIL has been a better mom to me over the past 10 years than my mom ever was. I went no contact with my parents for 4 years and it was the happiest, least stressful time of my life.", "NTA. But it sounds like you and your mom need to sit down and talk. I feel like your mom does love you, but she obviously have her other kids as priorities. Your feelings are valid but I'm sure that must have hurt her to find out in such a way. But maybe it is an opportunity, maybe you two need time to talk things over, just you and her. I'm not sure if she is the type to but you know your mom somehow. And from your words, it doesn't sound like you actually want to cut ties with her or anything, just that you wanted to actually enjoy the holiday for once. Hopefully your mom understands.", "NTA\nI suspect you mom really missed you. And she has no control how those \"adjacent\" families treated you.

You sound like that kid at a party that's constantly calling everyone to look at them.", "Nah dude, you're NTA.

What you SHOULD do, is whatever YOU decide is *best for YOU.* Your mom is having a hard time giving up being your boss/parent and switching over to the parent-of-an-independent-adult role. She reacted with anger from a place of pain or disappointment or whatever else was driving her, and you responded to her anger accordingly.  When things are calmer, it might be helpful to have a (non-judgemental) Adult Conversation, and open her eyes to real life as it is now & in the future.", "NTA", "NTA.

Proceed where you are welcomed.", "Agreed! The truth hurts! OP's mum was so distracted by her 'blended\" family she failed to notice that her own child was being pushed to the sidelines and not really included in her new family.

That\u2019s on her, not him.", "She didn't but I don't think she ever really had. I did tell her years ago, when I was younger, but she never really seemed to care.

I did sit down and talk to her when I was a kid.", "If she really has no control on how her husband and her stepchildren treated OP, she should at least call them out publicly and in front of OP for their behaviour. Otherwise, she's an accomplice.\n\nTo me, it seems like she is ok with the situation, and she doesn't want to be called out, nor to do anything to change the situation; in her eyes, apparently, OP needs to suck it up, and to her, keeping the peace and the appearances is more important than OP's wellbeing.", "That's very unlikely to happen because she's more concerned with the family overall and not so much me.", "I don't blame my mom for having other children. I do blame her for not caring about my feelings at all and putting me in situations where I was unwanted.", "Not super close to them either.

From what you describe (but I can of course be mistaken), it seems like she wants your presence, not you as a person.\n\nYou absence may prompt questions, or at least make her question herself, and she doesn't want that - she seems to be someone without self-doubt, someone who never questions her own actions, and doesn't want to question her own status as a good mother; so, even if no one asked anything about you, she would anyway be forced to ask herself why her own son prefers spending Christmas elsewhere, and she doesn't want that.\n\nNTA, of course - but I'm afraid she won't understand that, because she is in absolute denial about her own role in not being able to make you well accepted in you own home while you were growing up.", "Ok, so I feel the complexity of this case is above this sub's pay grade and I'd go with a cautious NAH verdict for now. I get the impression that your mum hasn't done well by you and some of that is poor communication by her. Where you go from here may depend upon history (i.e has your mum shown any willingness to improve your relationship, and does she even understand/accept that you think the relationship is poor?) and what you want from the future. Do you want to improve your relationship? I see below that you spoke to her when you were a kid, well now maybe it's worth one more go. Good luck with whatever you decide.", "That's how I feel about it. She didn't want to do anything and didn't want any attention drawn to the fact this was going on.

There is no way a single person would miss me enough to ask about me. But I could see it being a thing where she feels something about me not being there. Maybe not even because she cares so much as maybe she ends up the me when I'm not around.", "She has not shown that willingness and has not shown understanding."]}
