We started dating over 2 years ago and I met her family on their first visit to the college and they included me in lunch. Ever since I have kept in regular contact with them and when they visit Ember, they make sure they spend some time with me as well. They are really awesome people and have made me feel so included. They even buy me gifts for my birthday and Christmas.\n\nEmber and I moved in together in July and her family flew out to help us set up. They were so incredibly helpful to us and they invited us to Christmas dinner at that point. I say us but I really mean me since Ember goes to them anyway. It meant so much to me and I immediately said yes.\n\nMy mom was bothered by it when I told her and she put pressure on me to change my mind and go \"home\" right up until Christmas. I always told her I was going to Ember's family and never wavered or made this unclear to her. She just assumed I would choose her anyway.\n\nSo there's some background to this I should explain right here. I come from a \"blended\" family. I say \"blended\" because it really wasn't very well blended lol. My mom had me, met my stepdad when I was 2 or 3. He was a widower with a 6 and 8 year old. They got married. They also had two children together. My mom's family were never part of my life. They were in and out of jail for various things so mom didn't include them. I never knew my father or his family. My stepdad's family never saw me as one of their own. My stepsiblings had family from their mom's side who were very involved too. And growing up I always felt very out of place and like I didn't belong anywhere. My step and half siblings all had at least one set of grandparents who adored them and they had a great relationship with. I had no extended family. My stepsiblings never saw me as their brother and were distant. I was around both stepdad's family and his first wife's family and I always felt awkward. I was overlooked. Any inclusion was lesser than full inclusion other kids in the family had. I got it, especially with my stepsiblings family, but it would have been easier to stay at home. My mom never really got it or had much to say about it and my stepdad was never someone I felt I could talk to.\n\nAnyway, going home was not something I felt good about because I normally had to see all these people who didn't really want me. Christmas 2022 was rough for that very reason. I loved my Christmas with Ember's family though. Mom was so pissed at me for choosing to go there instead of home. She said we're not married yet and we're still so young we should be with our own family for Christmas. I told her I went there because I actually feel like I'm part of the family instead of being around a huge extended \"blended\" family where nobody fucking wants me. My mom told me that wasn't fair and she always wants me and so do my siblings. She told me I was saying things to be hurtful and that was unfair.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704276175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xfwk7/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_went_to_my_girlfriend/", "score": 2023, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also I understand your mom wanting you to be home for Christmas, but as a growing woman trying to find her place with your girlfriend be careful in using that as a crutch because it feels right. My mom sometimes  forgets especially now that I'm older with a SO that we spend time with his families at Christmas as well. But we find a balance in spending time with everyone so she gets a lil antsy when we are a lil late to show up for the festivities.  \nAlso your young and have some time to decide what you want in life. And if that's finding your own chosen family that makes you happy so be it. Again I think it's about balance as well. Maybe sit everyone down and tell everyone how you feel about not feeling wanted or part of the family like everyone does. Maybe they don't realize how you feel and things can be better if you open up about it. I'm sure it's not intended to make ya feel like that but they might not realize and think you're just being antisocial or you're the one not trying to take part. \nDon't be scared to communicate your feelings.", "\"I did everything for my son.

You tell your mother that you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re treated as part of the extended family and her response is all about how she feels?

We stayed stateside because I couldn\u2019t admit my family was fucked. I deeply regret it. \n\nMy sister is 20 years younger than me. She was born during a particularly chaotic time. At least I had real relationships with a larger base of living family. She got all of the chaos and really none of the connections due to age. \n\nShe\u2019s now living with a great guy whose family seems really together and inclusive and loving.

I gave up though.", "I would not be comfortable talking to them. They have always made it very clear that I'm unwanted and it's not unintentional. There's a lot of stuff that says they don't care.

I've been in that place where I wanted so much to had my kid but I was overwhelmed with work and problems until one day it struck me, that I had my priorities wrong. Another thing, I was a middle child with lots of siblings and also felt unwanted and lonely. Christmas was the worst, but I realised when I was older it wasn't the case. Yes, I was neglected but I exacerbated things by withdrawing in a strange effort to get attention and so did one of my brothers. It didn't work, but as time went on I didn't try to get validation from them and now I enjoy Christmas with my family. Part of that was just accepting the dynamics seeing that the people who mattered loved me and building from there. Just sharing a joke, calling to see how they are. \n\nIt's easy to slip into black and white thinking like people don't care, but I don't think it's really true. Your mum arguing to have you there is proof. She probably can't do a lot to change how extended family members treat you but I would ask myself these questions:\n\nWhat can I do to build a better relationship with my mum?\n\nAre my perceptions of how others feel about me true? What's the proof of that?\n\nWhat are concrete things I, or my family members, can change or do to have a truly blended family?\n\nI don't know your situation but I've been through and seen my own.

His older children probably resented you, because so often children see step siblings as being responsible for their parents not being together, regardless of how long they were divorced before the new partner was introduced.

I feel the same way about most of my family and I stopped talking to them altogether more than 20 years ago and I'm better off for it.", "Yes, there's a very big difference between being alone vs being lonely.  \n\n\nLoneliness is a feeling of disconnection from those around us.  When there's no-one around with whom we sense that we 'should' in some way be connected, we don't tend to feel as lonely.  This is why it's possible to feel lonely in a crowd, particularly if everyone else in that crowd seems to be enjoying connection with at least one other person there, while conversely feeling content with one's self, and not lonely, despite being alone.  \n\n\nIf your relationship with Ember doesn't pan out in the long run, I hope that you part on amicable terms so that you're still able to enjoy the acceptance of her family, and her as a friend.", "You sound like you have really thought about this a good bit. Its sad that the rest of your family  hasn't considered you in the same way.

So, you may want to try again in the future, as they mature, to see if there is any value in reconnecting.\n\n Especially if you locate to an interesting area, inviting them one at a time to visit for a weekend and show them the sights can create a different, deeper relationship. They would see you in a far different light - more mature, more interesting, and you would model and treat them how you would like to be treated. It can recalibrate your connection and make you see each other differently instead of just being part of the same thoughtless, overlooked dynamic as when you visit the family. \n\nGetting away from entrenched family dynamics can open up possibilities in unexpected and rewarding ways.", "NTA You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is in denial.

And NTA.", "I'm sorry to hear that, well there's your answer to just stop trying as much and distance yourself as much as you feel necessary for your mental wellbeing. You don't need to be around anyone that doesn't enjoy your presence. Sounds like you need to find your own family.

Where I used to make space for the toxic abuse, the scapegoating and the shunning, I filled that time up with meeting my own needs, which seemed weird, and interacting with other, better people on various levels. I don't miss the time with my bio family because I filled up that 'time for being treated badly' and replaced it with stuff that I suddenly had time for."]}
