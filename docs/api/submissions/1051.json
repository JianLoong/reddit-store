Maybe then she\u2019ll see how ridiculous she is. NTA", "NTA. For many reasons. She should have asked if you would be willing to contribute before hand. She definitely could have thrifted a maybe mismatched but much cheaper set if she really wanted it immediately and couldn't wait for the official supplier to come through. In any case, it remains her property, so she can take them back at any time she wants. Also, I personally think 100 dollars is a lot to spend on something for the office.", "NTA - you're not going to use it, she could've gotten a free one from a supplier, she's presumptuous to think others should \"chip in.\" Don't ever use the set and honestly she's only out $25 dollars instead of  the $100 she stupidly spent. For context: I bought coffee cups and lids for my office and didn't expect anyone to chip in. Myself and another co-worker set up a coffee station near our desks and provided everything, coffee, tea, cups, lids, stoppers, sleeves (because hot beverages) we did it to be nice and to being some cheer to our co-workers, expecting nothing in return. If someone wanted to chip in, fine, but we never asked anyone to do so.", "NTA\n\nAlso I don't understand why she was so vested in what style the table was. It's a table in an office work place and so whatever was in the catalogue that was the right size would be sufficient. If she was idiotic enough to spend her own money on a table when she could have gotten one from the supplier for free that is on her.\n\nSometimes a company cares about \"image\" but then they supply a table that is in line with their style just as they supply other office furnishing if they care about style.", "NTA. You\u2019d already say you weren\u2019t interested in using one. It\u2019s a job, not a home you own. If she gets fired she will try to take it with her and it\u2019s going to be drama. I\u2019d quietly suggest to the other people that they sign something saying it now belongs to the company or she has to pay them back for the set. \n\nNothing against the store but what is wrong with the big blue department store that is just about every 30 miles? Or the catalog sets? Is she moving in? Going to have epic feasts? It\u2019s for work. Most people leave for home as soon as possible.", "NTA. What a weird thing for her to do.", "Nta. You don't buy things for other people without permission. Very entitled of her.", "NTA, she wanted it, she can pay for it. No one else suggested it sorry for the ones who did pay something to this entitled woman. If there hr or any superior go ahead and report her harassment.", "NTA- You do not need to let people spend your money for you, which is what your coworker is retroactively trying to do here.\n\nYou said no, the purchase was her choice.", "NTA. The money aside,  everywhere worked had rules about what we could (and could not) bring into the workplace. This was seriously enforced after a small fire in the office kitchen.\n\n\nI know people make jokes about \"health and safety at work\" but what would happen if - for example - the flat pack table collapses and somebody gets a hot drunk land on them?\n\n\nThe dining set is not from an approved supplier and it was not assembled by professionals. That alone would negate any injury compensation.", "NTA.  Your coworker chose to purchase a dining set that cost $100, that she picked out, when there were free options.  Nope, I wouldn't give her a dime.", "NTA Why could she not get some of the free dining sets?! It is something she eat from at work! Why most it be her personal style? I wouldn't be surprised if she tries to take it with her if she quits. Why pay for something that just she wanted because of her taste and you could get for free and you don't even use?!", "NTA, if your co-worker feels it's necessary to buy furniture set although you can get one for free, it's her problem, not yours. Even if you used the table, you wouldn't have to contribute to her kitchen set because the one that was there and the one which would have been free wasn't good enough for her.", "She failed to get the consent of her co-workers before assigning them a financial obligation. NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't ask for permission to buy that, you owe her nothing.\n\nI'd rather burn $25 in front of her just to spite her.", "NTA and do not pay. She didn't ask you to contribute, giving you a chance to formally refuse, but you actually did say you wouldn't use it any way and she can be frosty all she wants, but no one told her to go spend $100 on a dining set.", "NTA.  Your co-worker is a jackass.  She was buying a table for the office, not making personal decorating decisions for her home.  It really doesn't matter that she was \"not happy\" with any of the tables in the catalogue.  Again, the kitchen area was not her personal property.\n\nIf she had asked you up front for a contribution to the purchase, she would have received solid feedback that would have guided her choices.  She did not.  Imo she should eat the table she bought for your kitchen (no pun intended).  Your coworkers should not have been guilted into giving her $25 each, but that was their choice.\n\nI don't know anyone who hasn't contributed something to an office area, be it a plant, a coffee pot, a table, a chair, etc.  None of these people ever asked for a reimbursement.  When people move on they take their stuff with them, or not.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBut $25 is not worth the drama IMHO.  You are well within your rights but for the low low price of 25 bucks you can make this all go away.  Otherwise, any time you set something on that table she is going to run her mouth\n\n\nI would however, make it clear that you are not chipping in if she buys any more furniture out of her own pocket", "No. It does make you a person with healthy boundaries. NTA.", "NTA. You told her you wouldn't use the set. She didn't speak to you about it before and she should have got one for free from the approved suppliers. If she wanted that one that bad, she should have sucked up the whole cost or had everyone agree beforehand.", "NTA. You never showed any intention of paying and she went out of her own way to purchase it and then demanded money afterwards.", "NTA\n\nNothing about what she did was reasonable. Not a thing.", "Nta she doesnt get to make you guys spend money on something she chose to do.", "NTA and good for you for standing your ground. Next time she gets an idea to 'improve' the working environment she'll think twice before making the same assumption.\n\nShe bought the table knowing you wouldn't use it but expected you to contribute towards something *she* wanted. Simply because *she* didn't like the choices from the approved supplier.", "Hahaha \"certain Scandinavian department store\", tickled. NTA, you know this obviously. Imagine being so invested in a space you occupy for maybe 30 minutes a day that you glossed over an entire catalog of free to buy something from freaking IKEA lmao. $25 isn't a great sum of money, nor is $100 - so your coworker is steaming over NOTHING and that's her problem. Buy a round for your other two coworkers at happy hour next time y'all go out and bitch about her to make up for their sheepish contributions lol", "NTA.  She had options approved of by the company, so she independently went out and bought a table, without confirming you would pitch in first, and brings it into work.\n\nYou had previously told her that you didn't care and wouldn't use it anyway. Don't pay for it.  Can she return it?", "NTA She bought, she can pay for it.", "NTA\n\nShe can\u2019t just try and spend your money without your approval.", "NTA. You already specifically told her you wouldn\u2019t use it and didn\u2019t care about it. You didn\u2019t lead her on or lie to her about contributing financially. She is trying to bully you into doing something she already knew you wouldn\u2019t want to do because you already told her this whole situation is of no interest to you.", "NTA", "NTA she wanted it and took it upon herself to buy it without sharing what it would cost everyone before buying it. She didn\u2019t ask for a certain contribution beforehand and you certainly didn\u2019t agree to it.", "NTA . . .\n\nI dare you to pay the $25, then take one chair and 1 table leg into your office for business use.", "NTA. She was the one who wanted it at all. She bought it. She can deal with her purchase", "NTA. I wouldn't pay either on principle. She put it on herself to buy that without an agreement from her coworkers and then she expects you to pay your share.", "NTA. We had a similar situation at my work. Someone suggested buying a coffeemaker for the kitchen and asked people to contribute if they wanted to use it. It was a small sum of money and I drink coffee all the time so I thought it was a great idea. Couple months later he quit and took the coffeemaker with him. Not a big deal at all cause it was just a small amount. But I think it's a bad idea to do combined purchases at work especially if you don't plan on using it. It would be different if you were part of the planning and agreed to spend money.", "Nope. Don\u2019t pay.", "You are giving your fair share -- $0.\n\nNTA", "NTA: Why would you pay for something you won't use, expressed you didn't want, and could've been gotten for free? That alone is ridiculous. The fact that she demanded to get reimbursed without clearing it first with those she expected money from is just shit flavored icing on an AH cake.", "NTA. She\u2019s being ridiculous.", "Nta. I hate to be forced to pay for things I don't want and won't use.", "Plus she could have chosen one from the catalogue for free", "As long as OP NEVER uses the set that is fair.  Otherwise she should charge OP $25 rent the first time OP uses a chair, or sits at the table.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \n\nYes!

Otherwise we wouldn't have had one. Then over time, it starts to rust, and the health inspector says it has to go. One of my coworkers gives it away to an employee in a lower paid category. I felt a bit peeved by that, because while I didn't want it, and would rather it go to someone who can use it, no one else was asked. I felt like it should have been offered among the \"owners\" first, or at the very least it needed a 30 second heads-up in the weekly staff meeting, instead of a unilateral decision. And I know I wasn't the only one thought that way. \n\nSo even when it's very cheap, and agreed upon beforehand, group ownership can cause problems.", "HR, or even just a higher up, to clarify with her that this was not okay. Maybe they can tell her to take it home and refund the other two, because as another comment pointed out this type of furniture is not designed for commercial use.", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf \n\n\nNope it's not a lot of money but it's the principle. \n\n\nNta", "Some people are crazy nesters in the office. I once had to escort someone from the building during a RIF action and clear out their cubicle.

That's why my office has a door.", "Also, the Ikea table is not likely to last long. The catalog options were probably uglier, but sturdy. She volunteered everyone to pay a premium for it to look pretty. \n\nI probably would have told her to try to get reimbursed through the company. But in any case NTA for rejecting an unnecessary surprise expense. I consider this to fall in the same category as wage theft, where employees subsidize or provide charity for employers.", "Would you rather had paid for it to be disposed of? Or would you have tried to sell a rusting microwave for a few dollars and then made sure everyone who paid got their 2 cents? Wow, people can be so petty. You didn't even want it.", "That sounds like my hospital room the last time I was in the hospital. I\u2019d been there for 4 months and had pillows, blankets, fan, backpack of items to keep busy, clothes\u2026 It looked like I\u2019d moved in by the time it was empty. \n\nAt my job I had a sign with my name. That\u2019s it. We weren\u2019t encouraged to keep personal items after we left for the day.

It wouldn't matter if it was $2, the fact that she is trying to scam you is the problem.\n\nAlso I can't help but think that when she leaves she will play the \"I bought it\" card and take it with her.

You're fault for spending so big when we don't make the salary to match.", "NTA\nI wonder if this unapproved item of furniture is covered by insurance.. would you be liable in the case of an accident as you would be a co-owner of reh unapproved product? \nTry charging this co- worker for your deodorant/ clothing etc... they aren't for her use but they are for the benefit of everyone in the office! \nNobody has a right to make a decision that will cost you financially without asking you first. Leave the co-worker short her $25, that was her choice not yours.", "NTA, you can't just buy something on your own and expect people to pay for it just because you didn't like the free options available for you to use instead. None of your coworkers should have given her the money honestly, they she would have been forced to return it or take the financial L herself. Also, giving in now sets a bad precedent for the future in case she wants to get something else (and more expensive) for the office later without approval", "It sets a bad precedent to pay her off now, she will do it again and have the same expectation.  She could have used the approved supplier and she didn\u2019t, it\u2019s on her", "You think it should have been offered to the owners first, but clearly another owner thought it should go to someone in a less desirable financial position. What makes your idea of how to dispose of it better than the other owner\u2019s?\n\nWas there supposed to be a microwave shareholders vote? If three people had each pitched in $35 to get a microwave you could have a discussion about what to do with it with the group, but when it\u2019s 21 people all putting in $5, that just wouldn\u2019t work. I mean, how do you decide what should happen?\n\nWhat about when four people who put in money all want it? Play darts for it? Flip coins? Who decides the competition? Who is the arbiter? Does the person who gets it need to reimburse everyone $2.50 since it\u2019s still clearly worth something?\n\nWhat happens if a third of the people who chipped in want it to go to the poorly paid employee, a third want it for themselves, and a third want to give it to charity?\n\nWhile the person who gave it away might not have had full rights to do so, no one had the full right to decide what to do with it, nor was there a small enough group to really have a productive conversation about it (unless this was a sub $40 microwave).  With no clear path forward, an item of little value, and owners who contributed very little to start, it makes sense that the first person to act got their way, and it wasn\u2019t a selfish or wasteful decision, so why worry about it?", "One chair each of course", "I think it's more the point that NONE of the people who chipped in to buy it were given the opportunity to take it before it was given to an outside person.", "I have a number of solid book cases from Ikea that have survived moving twice, insane weight from all the books I have and one child with ADHD and destructive tendencies. Their furniture is amazing."]}
