We planned for him to move to my country in the fall. \nNow I\u2019m almost finished with school and there\u2019s a trip planned for four days to a neighbouring country. I\u2019d really want to go, cause it might be the last chance to go with school and my friends there. The problem is, that trip is scheduled a week after my bf would arrive. I asked him and while he doesn\u2019t want to tell me no he\u2019s hurt as I would be putting friends and fun above him. \nI wouldn\u2019t go on a trip if he\u2019d just come for a visit obviously, cause time would be short.

It's 2 weeks later, maybe figure something out, you got time till fall.", "Can he not come with you?", "You wrote that he was hurt when you asked him. He moved to another country for you and you plan to abandon him the first week? That's a asshole move.", "Of course YTA. The guy is moving from another country and probably planned this for a long time, and suddenly you leave him and go for a week with college buddies? \n\nYou two obviously have to work a lot of things out and I feel sorry for the guy, because honestly if you are going to this I don't think you both are as committed. Would you have moved for him?", "NAH.

You're only gone for 4 days. \n\nI get that your bf is bummed, but as an adult, he's totally capable of handling himself for a few days while you're gone. I don't buy that him being in a new country matters - people solo travel all the time, and he's a grown adult who is totally capable of being independent for a handful of days. He should be able to zoom out a bit and recognize that him being bummed isn't more important than you missing an opportunity you'll never get again.\n\nIf he can't, then this is a lesson learned for you about his lack of independence, lack of ability to problem solve on his own, and him wanting to prioritize his short term comfort over your wants.\n\nWith that said - during his first week here, take some time together to sketch out some potential touristy things he can do alone. He should make sure he's set up with a transit pass, transit apps.

How long after his arrival are you expected to exclusively wait on him before you having your own life is no longer considered selfish and like you love your friends more than him? Why is this even a competition? Why is it not okay to put your friends and fun above him? I don't know. I don't like it.\n\nI kind of understand that he would be a bit bummed out, but I don't understand actually making that an issue. It's literally 4 days. He's in a new country.

Have fun and congrats on your graduation!", "NTA - speaking as someone who went on a long weekend with the girls on my 4-week wedding anniversary and am still married 33 years later.\n\nIt's four days, not forever.

BF is moving and will be living w OP, so it isn\u2019t as if he is coming for a visit and OP is abandoning him. It is likely this isn\u2019t the first trip there for BF so he prob has at least a sense of the area, and 4 days isn\u2019t an eternity. This sounds like a one time, pre-planned celebratory trip.

What better way for him to discover the new place he lives than with four days on his own rather than as half of a couple.", "NTA.

YTA.  He\u2019s moving from another country to be with you, and your plan is to ditch him by himself directly after he moves to a whole new country?", "NTA.  It will let him feel at home in your place.   Just make sure he has stuff to do.  Give him stuff to explore.  Art galleries, museums ect.  Points of interest.", "NTA\n\nit is only for 4 days.

It would give me a chance to settle in and relax. I realize most other people wouldn\u2019t feel this way. So you have to decide who\u2019s feelings are more important. But you\u2019re NTA for wanting to go. I get the disappointment of having to cancel the trip if that\u2019s what you decide.", "The timing is not optimal, but the trip is a once in a lifetime deal post-graduaiton and while he might feel slighted, he\u2019s an adult and should understand why you are going and support that. It\u2019s only a few days. If he\u2019s not supportive that way you should rethink the move. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. He sounds a bit controlling", "I have been in this exact situation, and I was the one moving across the country.

If OP goes then her boyfriend is hurt, if OP doesn\u2019t go then she can\u2019t celebrate her finishing school and with her friends. Both are very important in life I feel. Some will say YTA for leaving him for a four days when he just moved but tbf OP will be back, others will say NTA and don\u2019t regret life moments or hold yourself back for anyone. \n\nI think someone will be upset in the end regardless of what choice.", "Here is where (as often as the case) communication comes into play.  My opinion:  rather than asking internet strangers, actually have a real talk with him about this and expectations in general.", "I am really surprised at the y t a comments.\n\nYou said, putting fun and friends before your bf... You're young, this is the age for fun and friends, making memories. Take it from someone a little older than you, this is probably the last time you'll be all together again as a friend's group from uni despite good intentions of meeting up etc, life happens... and the trip is a one time only offer. \n\nYeah if I was your bf I'd be a bit annoyed but more so like isn't that so typical how things worked out time wise, I've moved here and she's going away after a week. Oh well. Lol. I'd be annoyed if you didn't go because of me! Which your bf does actually seem to understand so I wouldn't have even posted on here to be called an AH when the person that matters is OK with it. You will be living together, you'll have plenty of time to make memories and be together.\n\nHe's also a grown adult so I honestly think hell be fine on his own for 4 days. NTA. at all.\n\nPs.

I'm going to assume your boyfriend has visited before so he knows your place, the area you live in, etc. It's not ideal he'll have only been there a week before you leave but it's not like you're leaving the week he does turn up. You'll be there to help him settle that week before you go.\n\nIf it was a trip you planned with friends who you see regularly and could plan for anytime then I'd probably say you could skip it and go on the next one but this is a trip to celebrate graduating school with your school friends. I think it's okay for you to go and have fun celebrating before you all go off into your post school lives. \n\nI can understand him being hurt and I think if I was in his shoes, I'd probably feel a bit hurt too but I'd also encourage you to go and celebrate because it seems important to you.", "NTA. Seems like there's a lot of really co-dependant people in the comments lol. He's coming to live with you, not just visit. A week is long enough to get decently settled and comfy. Not like he isn't used to time apart.", "NTA. You have a few days beforehand and forever thereafter to be with. Also, he might benefit from some time alone in his new home.", "NTA. if I were in your boyfriend\u2019s shoes I would likely be happy for you to have fun with your uni friends and I would also enjoy exploring my new city on my own for a few days. I would think differently if you would be gone when he arrives.", "NTA. I see this as an orange flag. Is he going to cling to you the whole time you live together? How long would be long enough? \n\nI\u2019d think this would give him a chance to settle into his new country and new home. They can have a staycation with enough food in the house for the week, or start getting used to the neighborhood by taking small jaunts.", "Why can't he go with you?\n\nMy husband and I were long distance for 3 years while I finished my undergrad degree. I moved \"home\" a few days after graduation. I would have been extremely hurt and angry if he went on a trip without me right after I movef home.", "Yes. If it was you that move to a new country and just after arriving he left to on a trip with friends. What will you feel. Like shit, like he didn't care, like all the sacrifice you made to come here meant nothing. like it was better to leave now instead of putting more energy on an AH boyfriend. We'll that is exactly what he is thinking, he is not speaking because he knows you can't control other actions and behavior, and this is so shitty it doesn't need any kind of comments, just a reaction after thinking. He is in the thinking phase, and probably close to dump you if you don't react.", "100% NTA, the only reason I would consider otherwise is if he doesn\u2019t speak the language or like literally can\u2019t function in your country without you", "Take him with you.", "NTA - your boyfriend will need time to settle in and get to know the area you live in. He can do that without you for four days. Go and have a good time.", "NTA.\n\nHe's a grown man and it's 4 days. You're not going out of your way to abandon him, and you're not going away forever. It seems like a one time trip for you, and you'll come back to him. \n\nAnd again, it's only a four day trip!! He can take those 4 days to unpack and settle in, in peace.

Or did you tell him once he was there?", "I feel like depending on the situation, it's either NAH or YTA. I can definitely see your point of view. School is ending. This trip is something you won't get to do again. It's one last celebration with friends. And yeah, your bf is now going to be close. So that 4 days doesn't seem like a big deal. On the other hand, how familiar is your boyfriend with your home? Does he have other friends or family there? Does he speak the language? What's his housing/job situation? A week is not a long time to get settled if you are packing up and moving your whole life and have no connections. And while 4 days doesn't seem long, he'll probably still be setting up his new life in those days. Setting up his new house/apartment. Job hunting or freshly into a new job.

It\u2019s not like he is moving there and then finding out.", "But it's not like she planned this event and specifically chose this date. The timing of it is out of her control, and with it being with so many other people I'm pretty sure it'd be hard to reschedule. I wouldn't call OP an AH for wanting to go on a trip with people she'll probably barely ever see again. And if he's there permanently,  it's not like she's wasting time they have together.", "And they can continue to be together years after that but this trip won't happen again. They have to look at this long-term. It's only 4 days apart - I get that it's not ideal for him but it's not that big of a deal.", "She isn\u2019t emigrating", "So are you saying the guy isn't allowed to be sad or disappointed they just got back together and she's already taking off again? Everyone that's putting blame on him didn't read that he said he wasn't angry or sad about it, but it's also like his side isn't understandable at all. Yea, the trip is important, she shouldn't miss it, but he's allowed to feel  bad about missing her isn't he? \n\n  He was probably really excited and happy to be back, wanted to spend a lot of time together, catch up, go out and do things or just chill, and now the first bit of time back is interrupted. It's hard. It's not a bad thing for him to be feeling bad about it, but it would be a bad thing to keep her from doing it, and I'm sure it wasn't a spontaneous trip so he might of known about it prior to the move.\n\n   NAH, it's a crappy situation to be stuck in, because yall both want time together but you also want your trip and to celebrate your school being finished.maybe he can tag along?", "There's plenty they can and should be doing together in those first couple weeks as well. \n\nThis is a trip with friends, not some major life event. If these friends are important, there will be future trips with them (source: I'm older than OP by quite a bit and still regularly take trips with close friends).", "I don't think it's a dick move. I think the dick move is him trying to make her miss an important trip, with people she may never be able to travel with again, that marks the end of a major milestone.", "I've travelled extensively, including on my own and living in new countries for months at a time. \n\nI don't find this hurtful, because I know OP's choice isn't about me. It's about a once in a lifetime trip that wraps up a major milestone. My temporary discomfort doesn't take priority over something that could easily be a long term regret.", "This is a trip with classmates in the time before they graduate. I liken this to the \"senior week\" events a lot of universities have, where people go skiing and to the casino. That's an incomparable experience.\n\nHe's there, ostensibly, long term. They'll have plenty of time to get things done together. There's nothing in that second week that would require her presence for those 4 days.", "Please don't get me wrong, I think this is a NAH situation. Putting myself in his position, I'd think it was kind of a dick move. I'd be feeling some type of way about it. Putting myself in her position, I get why she wants to go. Honestly, I think the best compromise would be him joining her on this trip to get to know some of her school friends and explore a new country together. Is that feasible? Who knows? Is this breakup-worthy? Absolutely not, just kinda sucks", "In other words you've never moved continents and don't know what it's like. It's a once in a lifetime move.", ">This is a trip with classmates in the time before they graduate. I liken this to the \"senior week\" events a lot of universities have, where people go skiing and to the casino. That's an incomparable experience\n\nNo, it isn't. OP is 27. The fact that she hasn't graduated yet doesn't make this any more special than any other trip, and some other students certainly will be bringing their partners. \n\nThis isn't about required presence, it's about showing the barest minimum of respect for your partner.", "I've lived across multiple continents for months at a time.\n\nI'm not saying it isn't difficult. I'm saying that there's no reason a 30 yo can't handle 4 days alone on the new continent.", "Did I say he couldn't? Try reading next time.", "I didn't say he said he couldn't. I said there's no reason he couldn't."]}
