We planned for him to move to my country in the fall. \nNow I\u2019m almost finished with school and there\u2019s a trip planned for four days to a neighbouring country. I\u2019d really want to go, cause it might be the last chance to go with school and my friends there. The problem is, that trip is scheduled a week after my bf would arrive. I asked him and while he doesn\u2019t want to tell me no he\u2019s hurt as I would be putting friends and fun above him. \nI wouldn\u2019t go on a trip if he\u2019d just come for a visit obviously, cause time would be short.

It's 2 weeks later, maybe figure something out, you got time till fall.", "Can he not come with you?", "You wrote that he was hurt when you asked him.

The guy is moving from another country and probably planned this for a long time, and suddenly you leave him and go for a week with college buddies? \n\nYou two obviously have to work a lot of things out and I feel sorry for the guy, because honestly if you are going to this I don't think you both are as committed. Would you have moved for him?", "NAH.

You're only gone for 4 days. \n\nI get that your bf is bummed, but as an adult, he's totally capable of handling himself for a few days while you're gone. I don't buy that him being in a new country matters - people solo travel all the time, and he's a grown adult who is totally capable of being independent for a handful of days. He should be able to zoom out a bit and recognize that him being bummed isn't more important than you missing an opportunity you'll never get again.\n\nIf he can't, then this is a lesson learned for you about his lack of independence, lack of ability to problem solve on his own, and him wanting to prioritize his short term comfort over your wants.\n\nWith that said - during his first week here, take some time together to sketch out some potential touristy things he can do alone.

How long after his arrival are you expected to exclusively wait on him before you having your own life is no longer considered selfish and like you love your friends more than him? Why is this even a competition? Why is it not okay to put your friends and fun above him? I don't know. I don't like it.\n\nI kind of understand that he would be a bit bummed out, but I don't understand actually making that an issue. It's literally 4 days. He's in a new country.

Have fun and congrats on your graduation!", "NTA - speaking as someone who went on a long weekend with the girls on my 4-week wedding anniversary and am still married 33 years later.\n\nIt's four days, not forever.

Moving with your partner does not mean you have to be glued to your partner 24/7, which, if you do, will become overbearing.

BF is moving and will be living w OP, so it isn\u2019t as if he is coming for a visit and OP is abandoning him. It is likely this isn\u2019t the first trip there for BF so he prob has at least a sense of the area, and 4 days isn\u2019t an eternity. This sounds like a one time, pre-planned celebratory trip.

What better way for him to discover the new place he lives than with four days on his own rather than as half of a couple.", "NTA.

YTA.  He\u2019s moving from another country to be with you, and your plan is to ditch him by himself directly after he moves to a whole new country?", "NTA.  It will let him feel at home in your place.   Just make sure he has stuff to do.  Give him stuff to explore.  Art galleries, museums ect.  Points of interest.", "NTA\n\nit is only for 4 days.

It would give me a chance to settle in and relax. I realize most other people wouldn\u2019t feel this way. So you have to decide who\u2019s feelings are more important. But you\u2019re NTA for wanting to go. I get the disappointment of having to cancel the trip if that\u2019s what you decide.", "The timing is not optimal, but the trip is a once in a lifetime deal post-graduaiton and while he might feel slighted, he\u2019s an adult and should understand why you are going and support that. It\u2019s only a few days. If he\u2019s not supportive that way you should rethink the move. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. He sounds a bit controlling", "I have been in this exact situation, and I was the one moving across the country.

If OP goes then her boyfriend is hurt, if OP doesn\u2019t go then she can\u2019t celebrate her finishing school and with her friends. Both are very important in life I feel. Some will say YTA for leaving him for a four days when he just moved but tbf OP will be back, others will say NTA and don\u2019t regret life moments or hold yourself back for anyone. \n\nI think someone will be upset in the end regardless of what choice.", "Here is where (as often as the case) communication comes into play.  My opinion:  rather than asking internet strangers, actually have a real talk with him about this and expectations in general.", "I am really surprised at the y t a comments.\n\nYou said, putting fun and friends before your bf... You're young, this is the age for fun and friends, making memories. Take it from someone a little older than you, this is probably the last time you'll be all together again as a friend's group from uni despite good intentions of meeting up etc, life happens... and the trip is a one time only offer. \n\nYeah if I was your bf I'd be a bit annoyed but more so like isn't that so typical how things worked out time wise, I've moved here and she's going away after a week. Oh well. Lol. I'd be annoyed if you didn't go because of me! Which your bf does actually seem to understand so I wouldn't have even posted on here to be called an AH when the person that matters is OK with it. You will be living together, you'll have plenty of time to make memories and be together.\n\nHe's also a grown adult so I honestly think hell be fine on his own for 4 days. NTA. at all.\n\nPs.

I'm going to assume your boyfriend has visited before so he knows your place, the area you live in, etc. It's not ideal he'll have only been there a week before you leave but it's not like you're leaving the week he does turn up. You'll be there to help him settle that week before you go.\n\nIf it was a trip you planned with friends who you see regularly and could plan for anytime then I'd probably say you could skip it and go on the next one but this is a trip to celebrate graduating school with your school friends. I think it's okay for you to go and have fun celebrating before you all go off into your post school lives. \n\nI can understand him being hurt and I think if I was in his shoes, I'd probably feel a bit hurt too but I'd also encourage you to go and celebrate because it seems important to you.", "NTA. Seems like there's a lot of really co-dependant people in the comments lol. He's coming to live with you, not just visit. A week is long enough to get decently settled and comfy. Not like he isn't used to time apart.", "NTA. You have a few days beforehand and forever thereafter to be with. Also, he might benefit from some time alone in his new home.", "NTA. if I were in your boyfriend\u2019s shoes I would likely be happy for you to have fun with your uni friends and I would also enjoy exploring my new city on my own for a few days. I would think differently if you would be gone when he arrives.", "NTA. I see this as an orange flag. Is he going to cling to you the whole time you live together? How long would be long enough? \n\nI\u2019d think this would give him a chance to settle into his new country and new home. They can have a staycation with enough food in the house for the week, or start getting used to the neighborhood by taking small jaunts.", "Why can't he go with you?\n\nMy husband and I were long distance for 3 years while I finished my undergrad degree. I moved \"home\" a few days after graduation. I would have been extremely hurt and angry if he went on a trip without me right after I movef home.", "Yes. If it was you that move to a new country and just after arriving he left to on a trip with friends. What will you feel. Like shit, like he didn't care, like all the sacrifice you made to come here meant nothing. like it was better to leave now instead of putting more energy on an AH boyfriend. We'll that is exactly what he is thinking, he is not speaking because he knows you can't control other actions and behavior, and this is so shitty it doesn't need any kind of comments, just a reaction after thinking. He is in the thinking phase, and probably close to dump you if you don't react.", "100% NTA, the only reason I would consider otherwise is if he doesn\u2019t speak the language or like literally can\u2019t function in your country without you", "Take him with you.", "NTA - your boyfriend will need time to settle in and get to know the area you live in. He can do that without you for four days. Go and have a good time.", "NTA.\n\nHe's a grown man and it's 4 days. You're not going out of your way to abandon him, and you're not going away forever. It seems like a one time trip for you, and you'll come back to him. \n\nAnd again, it's only a four day trip!! He can take those 4 days to unpack and settle in, in peace.

Or did you tell him once he was there?", "I feel like depending on the situation, it's either NAH or YTA. I can definitely see your point of view. School is ending. This trip is something you won't get to do again. It's one last celebration with friends. And yeah, your bf is now going to be close. So that 4 days doesn't seem like a big deal. On the other hand, how familiar is your boyfriend with your home? Does he have other friends or family there? Does he speak the language? What's his housing/job situation? A week is not a long time to get settled if you are packing up and moving your whole life and have no connections. And while 4 days doesn't seem long, he'll probably still be setting up his new life in those days. Setting up his new house/apartment. Job hunting or freshly into a new job.

I would literally be like \"have fun, babe!\" And entertain my own self for the next few days.

It\u2019s too easy to completely integrate your social life into your partner\u2019s and not have an identity outside of them.\n\nIt may be lonely for him for a week, but in the long run, it\u2019ll make for a less lonely life in your city for him.", "NTA. It's only 4 days it's a whole week after he already arrives this allows him to settle in and figure things out. He's 30 Yrs old he will be fine. Life is to short to miss out on opportunities.", "NAH. I understand him being hurt or upset, he\u2019s  moving in and right after you will going on a trip for 4 days. However, you are not wrong for attending this trip with your classmates for graduation. \n\nI think you should pick out some local spots you go to / enjoy(food places, shopping, parks, etc) and show them to him or let him know about them. He can get to know his new local area or stay in and relax after moving. You can keep in touch while traveling and check in. \n\nIf he pushes this and tries to guilt you into not going on the trip though then he would be TA.", "NTA. \n\nPeople commenting here sound like they\u2019ve never left their home town before - tons of people go to cities they\u2019ve never been to before (even where they don\u2019t speak the language!) and can entertain themselves for a couple of days. I cannot fathom why your boyfriend cannot do the same. \n\nThere is only one opportunity for your trip, you\u2019ve worked hard for it and you deserve to go.", "I think I'm going to say NTA. I do think a ton of the others in the comments make super good points. I currently am in a LDR not as long as you two have been but a very good chunk of time and it's hard as shit. If I was moving in with my partner and they had a trip right after i moved in, I would have similar feelings to your boyfriend I think. I also would be genuinely okay with it, though. I think that it would be hard but not the end of the world, and I understand why you want to have the chance to have fun with your friends one last time before Uni is over. Shit changes, you should savor that fun while you can. It also might be a really good opportunity for your boyfriend to get used to your space and have a chance to make it his space as well. \nThat's just my feelings personally. I really don't think that this is as huge of a deal as others are making it out to be.\nCommunicat with your boyfriend, if he is genuinely nervous about being there alone I would say maybe now is not the best time for a trip, he might need you there for that transition period and that's okay for him to ask you for that. I don't think it's bad for you to want to be able to do that transition period from uni the way you want to either and I think its fair to ask for that from him as well.\nI hope this made sense and I wish you two luck <3", "I don't think you're an AH for it. It's a special occasion. The timing was just messed up a bit. \n\nHomie should be okay for 4 days.", "I think for now it's NAH. Y'all need to have an open and honest conversation. I can understand the perspective that he's there permanently now and 4 days isn't that long, and can give him a chance to settle in. But I can also understand that he might really want to spend LOTs of time with you right after the move and have a support system nearby for getting used to the new area. So I think how y'all proceed comes down to having a emotionally vulnerable and open chat, which is good practice for setting the stage for your future relationship.\n\nBUT after a couple weeks of settling in - if he starts to dominate your time and shame/discourage you for spending time with friends, that would be a huge red flag.", "NAH.\n\nIf you're going to be living together, then there's plenty of time to make up for a few lost days.\n\nWhile other commentary are saying \"you should be there to show him around\", I think that's a great reason for you not to be there.\n\nHe'll have a chance to explore and find things he likes rather than live in your shadow and do the things you like.", "NTA, 4 days is nothing", "This seems complicated. I get wanting to go on a trip after finishing school but at the same time he did just move. \nAlso guys are not the best at communicating how we feel, so i am not surprised he is not saying anything. \nSo it really is complicated sorry", "NTA\n\nIs there a reason your bf can\u2019t adjust his schedule to arrive after you come back from your trip?  \n\nRegardless agree with other posters he is a grown man.   \n\nYou will be together a short time and then you will be gone a week - not for months. \n\nHe should be capable of finding things to do while you are gone.  Explore some local sites, check out places to eat, catch up in reading, whatever.  \n\nIf this is a huge issue have you all discussed what type of careers you will have?   If he can\u2019t deal for a week is the expectation neither of you will ever travel for work?", "Yta\nFriends over a long distance boyfriend new to area and knows noone.

Both of y\u2019all have valid reasons for what you want and should probably sit down and talk deeper about this. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely allowed to want to go on this trip.

I don\u2019t see you wanting to go as prioritizing your friends, just wanting to experience what may be a last-chance trip  \n\nHe\u2019s absolutely allowed to not want you to go.

He doesn\u2019t know the area as well as you, he\u2019s never lived there. This is new for him, and it\u2019s exciting for both of you.

He can give you a few days for this graduation trip.", "They have the rest of their lives to be together, what 4 days ?", "NTA. He's 30! You'll be there for the week after he arrives. It's 4 days on his own in the country where he now lives, while you have a well-earned vacation to celebrate a once in a lifetime achievement. It's disappointing he is pouting at all. It is healthy and important to have your separate interests and experiences with your friends. That doesn't end the day you move in together.", "I had a similar situation happen to me some years ago. I moved cross country to be with my bf. Multi day drive and had to have my belongings shipped. It was to an area of the country that has caused a lot of divorces due to where it was located. Very rural, no trees, flat as a board, and smelled like death. So it was obvious I really loved my bf to make the move. I gave up my career and income to do this. My bf did make the multi day drive with me at least. We get there and he tells me that he voluntarily signed up for a work trip the next week and it was a week long. I was shocked and kinda pissed that he thought that was a good idea. Especially since I knew he was going on another work trip a few weeks later for almost two weeks and he had a 2 month long work trip in a couple months. So I could not fathom why he would voluntarily sign up for this one, knowing he was going to be gone for a lot of the spring and summer.  I told him this and at first he didn't see what the big deal was. Even our friends couldn't believe he did that. But then he explained the purpose of the trip and why he signed up for it, even though he knew I was moving my entire life to be with him the week prior. I was still annoyed but realized it was going to be helpful for his career. I spent that week unpacking and making myself at home. It all worked out in the end. We've been together for 12 years married for 9. I still will jokingly give him shit for that move though and some of our friends do as well. I would sit down and have a serious conversation with him about why you feel this trip is important and what you want to do together when you get back etc. Also, listen to his concerns and why he is upset. You can work through this. I don't know if I would call you an asshole but I understand why he would think you were behaving like one.", "NAH he is allowed to be disappointed, but this is the last chance for this type of trip with these people. You are moving in together, you will have plenty of time together down the road. This timing does suck a little bit, but he is a grown adult that needs to learn to be okay being independent and alone in your area. You should go and enjoy and have fun, and you both should talk about and understand the importance of the trip and also the mutual independence required in a long-term relationship living together.", "NTA.", "NTA.

Personally my partner frequently leaves the country to visit his family as he is not from the states. Although we are trying to move in, I feel it would be just another trip to his family. Wether I like it or not would be irrelevant as Ive just had to get used to him leaving and me holding down fort here. However, in the case your partner would feel lost and hurt from moving to a new country and having you leave, I can understand him wanting you there.

I think this trip is a little more important than the people here realize. You're setting a precedent for the rest of your lives together.

I do agree that some people are treating him as helpless and abandoned though and that's just crazy.", "I\u2019ve lived in three continents and I think four days without her are more than reasonable.", "So what would it make a difference if OP leaves him to be alone, in a safe shared apartment with proper connections to resources, for **4 days**, especially to participate in something *once in a lifetime*?   \nAlternatively, is OP to not at all have a life for, say, a year? If that is how long it takes for him to get his bearings?", "I don\u2019t see how.

Basically I adapt to the situation. It's only 4 days. If it were me I'd find something to keep me busy.\n\nThey have the rest of their lives presumably, there'll be plenty of time. I totally understand why the OPs bf is disappointed after all that time apart, but what's 4 more days at this point? I think it's fair for OP to choose to do her end of the year/school activities, within reason. To me 4 days is reasonable.\n\nIt seems like while he's not thrilled about it he isn't complaining either, so NAH here imo.

This is a school-sponsored trip with all of her classmates.", "As someone who\u2019s moved to two separate continents alone as an adult, I have to disagree with your sentiments. 7 days is not enough to acclimatize, but this is a healthy opportunity for OP\u2019s partner to navigate the city independently. It may feel lonely during the 4 days, but it\u2019ll help ward off loneliness in the long term.\n\nOP\u2019s partner can use this time to explore the city on his own, find places and things to do that he likes, and maybe make a few new friends so he isn\u2019t entirely dependent on OP to maintain a social life. It\u2019s sometimes difficult to maintain individuality in a relationship, it\u2019s even more difficult when you\u2019re moving to a new country for a partner and you don\u2019t have a social circle of your own.", "Oh yeah. I\u2019d get a nice buzz going if I was in a legal weed state (or try to score some weed/shrooms from what social relations I did have) and go stare at art.

It's not reasonable to prioritize short term discomfort over a unique life event.", "So, you mean the bf needs to understand his GF feelings will be really hurt by missing this short friends bonding time and stop whining?

My advice to her is to keep an eye on this. As sometimes it's not until you start living with someone permanently that you start to see certain things you simply couldn't have seen when you were long distance. If this is a one off and he comes around, great. But I would definitely pay attention to see if it becomes a pattern and what is the limit. Hopefully he has a job and all that lined up and actually plans to  make a life outside of her....\n\nOr else it can quickly devolve into every single thing becoming about how he moved to a new country for her therefore she should agree to do only what he wants. Like if he doesn't make friends or doesn't find work then it becomes well you shouldn't hang out with friends either because I've only been here 3 months. Well should you really go out for drinks with your coworkers alone when I've only been here for 8 weeks and moved for you. And on and on.\n\nI hope it doesn't become that. But that would be my concern. One of the worst things to do is to move for someone without having any true plans of forging your own independent life and taking the initiative, and also being willing to risk it not working out and having to fend for yourself.", "I totally get being a little disappointed, but the helpless and abandoned part  is  what's wild to me too. Part of being a grown up in relationships is also managing our disappointment and allowing our partners to live their lives and self soothing. We even teach little kids this.\n\nBut also, he is *permanently* moving. So this just makes even less sense to me. A grown up should be able to understand that in the grand scheme of living together, presumably for the next several years, a 4 day trip is not a big deal and doesn't materially change anything. What would they have done of such significance if she stays? Nothing at all. She would be staying just to stay, missing her graduation trip when she has 400 more days to see him everyday. \n\nIt's not like he's there for a two week visit and she's gone for 4 of those days. I would say she would be the AH then. But you're gonna be together and see each other every other day after that for a long time, so if a grown up can't put that in perspective, it's concerning.", "I do too, which is why I agree NAH. If it was two weeks after he moved there, I'd probably feel differently. Of course, this situation is unique and probably won't happen again in their lives. I like my alone time as well, but I'm also anxious in new places and would like a couple weeks to settle in. That's just MY preference, and I understand different people have different preferences. \n\nAll that being said, my husband agrees with you. It's 4 days. She's been working her butt off in school, and deserves the break and one last hurrah with these friends before they presumably go off to do their own things. The timing is what it is, and it's no one's fault. I guess I empathize with him more because I've been in his position, and didn't much like it. Again, not breakup-worthy, just kinda a bummer.", "You moving to different cou tries multiple times by choice alone just shows how little you can relate to OPs boyfriend. He isn't choosing to move alone. He is choosing to be with OP. He can take all the time in the world to go off on his own once he is comfortable doing so but it sounds like he is more likely to spend the 4 days cooped up since he already voiced his disappointment. I see no resolution. OP can't simply include him in the celebration,  isn't that a big part of what a partner is for? To be there to enjoy accomplishments together?", "Short term discomfort? I would honestly consider ending the relationship if I were OP's boyfriend.\n\nI don't think any of you have ever been in a long distance relationship and understand how awful it feels. For someone to be so callous about their partner's feelings is a huge red flag.\n\nAlso, a unique life event? It's a holiday. Let's not be dramatic here. She's not being handed a Nobel Prize.

Adults move all the time without anyone holding their hand through the process let alone holding their hand for weeks after the fact.", "This kind of view comes off like it\u2019s encouraging codependency. She may be the main reason he\u2019s moving there but ultimately if the move is successful he will have his own independent life there as well, with not every piece of it attached to her. It can feel scary to be in a new unfamiliar place, but when you\u2019ve made the life decision to be in that unfamiliar place long-term, you will need to face that discomfort. If a partner is asked to give up an important opportunity as part of the partnership, what tone does that set for the rest of their time together, what other parts of themselves do they have to suppress for the sake of their relationship? The good of her once in a lifetime trip simply seems more concrete than any potential bad of his 4 days alone.\n\nHowever, I will say this: if the move feels to the boyfriend like a sacrifice more than something he\u2019s actively excited about choosing, and especially if there\u2019s an overall dynamic in the relationship where he\u2019s shifting himself to accommodate her more than the other way around, then I get how this news could feel like a slap in the face to him.

If he can't be happy for her to go on this trip and can't cope with her being gone a measly four days, does he want her as a partner or a parent?", "How old are you? Its 4 days lol.

Just..practice being alone in a new space. That's HEALTHY to do!!!\n\nThey have (presumably) the rest of their lives to live together, so why not encourage her to go have fun with friends before the friends all separate and go their own ways??\n\nHow long should OP stay at home with him until she's allowed to go on trips with non-him-people again? 1 week? 1 month? 10 years? After they have kids and they graduate college? There isn't really a number to give to this, so why is 1 week worse than 6 months? \n\nOP's going to be on a trip for a few days, but he can't entertain himself? He has a place to stay, and they'll (presumably) go grocery shopping before she leaves, so he basically gets to be a solo tourist for a week in her town with affordable housing. Go and explore dude! That's what travelling and being a tourist is all about!!! Find a sketchy bar, or eat some weird ass food, or see a local play, or a sport event, or anything that touristy people do. And then when OP gets home they can both share what they did during their \"SUPER FUN TRIPS!!!!\"", "Yeah, I've seen enough 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 to know that this is often the case when a foreigner moves to a different country to be with someone.\n\n It's very lonely when you know absolutely no one, and depending on where they are from and what their first language is they may have a language barrier to make good friends easily by themselves. Even if he's not hurt (whether he says he isn't or is keeping it to himself (which is slightly separated from my point) ), he will be very lonely and could develop some resentment. Or at the minimum he will be very likely quite bored while OP is in the exact opposite situation of having a blast. I don't understand why the vacay couldn't have been moved, or for him to be able to come along", "And depending on how far he has to travel, he might be jet lagged for a day or two after arriving. I know after a big move/trip I need a few days to decompress and sort of get back on my feet again.", "Can he not entertain himself? \n\nI mean, I've travelled to different countries before, it's the exact same thing. If he just frames it like it's a 2 week trip with his gf, who has to leave for something, then he can just be a tourist while she's gone. \n\nI'll admit it's a little unconventional, but it's also not THAT big of a deal. And he may be \"sad\" about it, but also it may be something he's okay with and understanding.\n\nAnd how long should OP stay home with him until it's okay to leave? 1 week, 1 month, 10 years? What's the math here?", "Same. I'd miss them and wished they were with me. But it's basically a graduation trip, aka once a lifetime sorta deal.

This sentiment is the norm, not the exception.", "Of course in a new country! Why would a grown man need help with that??? It\u2019s not an alien planet.", "And he will have had a week with OP there to show him around before she leaves.", "Going on a short vacation is ditching your partner?  That\u2019s ridiculous!  If he takes it that way he is insecure and not ready for a relationship.  Most couples have to navigate far more complicated and stressful things than one going out of town for a few days at an inopportune time.", "To add to your point, moving in together is rough! I would think 4 days to himself would help him get adjusted better. And it will be a great precursor to a relationship that isn't codependent just because they live together. NAH though because some people are socially dependent, and I guess I can understand why he would need to have his hand held the first few weeks in a new country. \n\nThe timing isn't great, but I don't think OP should miss this trip to celebrate their graduation with the people who have been through it with her. It really cements those kinds of friendships which can be just as important as a romantic relationship.", "Plus, a few days alone in a new home might be good for him! He\u2019s moving into someone else\u2019s space and that will give him some time to settle in without OP being around. Like, I love my husband and all, but there are times when actual alone time in our space helps me feel more at home than anything else. \n\nThe timing is unfortunate but if he can\u2019t be a grown-up about a short trip, maybe he\u2019s not ready to be a live-in partner \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "There\u2019s the compassion and nuance this sub is known for \u2764\ufe0f", "I prefer to discover a new country on my own.

It's more the fact that she's literally leaving the country a few days after he gets there. I don't know, if my husband had to go to another country *3 years* I sure wouldn't be heading out the door as soon as he got back. I would have missed him and want to spend time together and reconnect now that we finally can. Heck, even when I have to travel for a few weeks for work, we usually make a point to make time for each other when I get back. Going on a trip under normal circumstances isn't a big deal, but after such a long time apart?

He gets to play tourist by himself for 4 days. The last work trip I went on was 15 days by myself, in a country I don't speak the language of, and I had a blast!!! He can make due for 4 days as he checks out the town. And if he doesn't want to do that? Go play Tears of the Kingdom or something till she gets back", "But again, he's a grown ass adult.

There's a difference between being a lil sad and being unable to cope. Of course he'll be a lil sad at first, but a functioning adult should be able to spend 4 days without their partner holding their hand. Even in a new country, even after living apart for 9 months. He shouldn't want to hinder her from experiencing her life since they are actually two separate people, not one mega person that cannot function apart.", "Yeah cause that sounds soooo fun", "Exactly this! \n\nYou have a WEEK together to help move stuff in, have some time together, and show him around the area. Then you will be gone for FOUR DAYS. That is it. Four days out of a lifetime together. You have spent nine months apart, four more days isn't going to make it or break it. As *unled_horse* said, you have a \"chance to cement friendships that could last you a lifetime\". \n\nPlease go. You deserve to do this for yourself. You will most likely regret NOT doing it. It will also give him a chance to explore the area by himself. I used to travel a lot by myself (yes, to other countries, several of which didn't have English as their primary language ...and, yes, I'm an American \ud83d\ude02), and finding my way around new places empowered me. I honestly believe the trip will benefit both of you.", "I love the idea of a scavenger hunt! She could leave clues and romantic presents in all her favorite places for him to find.

I actually had the opposite viewpoint until I read this. \n\nHonestly, i think the consensus in society is that you have to put your partner first in everything, but what about our prior friends, commitments, aspirations? Do we just abandon our lives because we are in a committed relationship, or can we have both?  Our lives should not revolve around our partners only.

If OP had been living with her boyfriend for 5 years and he had this reaction, the story would be completely different. \n\nThis trip is just 4 days, it's not THAT rough. Can he be sad about it?? Of course he can. Can he be sad and supportive about her trip?? Of course he can. All of these things are very acceptable.\n\nBut don't let any partner manipulate you in missing out on a once in a lifetime trip with friends, just because they'll miss you for 4 days.

Once in a lifetime is what you do when you move across the world to be with a partner.", "It should also be a choice he made for himself and what he wants in his future not just for her and the sake of their relationship.", "Im not saying its that but when you make a giant choice and change you need to know how to handle and care for yourself when making it. You need to at least know the basics of what to do when you make this choice so you arent completely lost and fully dependent on someone else.

And claiming she's putting 'friends and fun' ahead of him? is she ever going to get to have 'friends and fun' or is that just a thing for single people now?", "I\u2019m going to venture a guess that you\u2019re American.", "Ultimately OP is NTA. I do understand that he might be bummed, but he should still encourage her to go and not be angry or resentful... If he prohibits it or holds a grudge or yells or anything like that... Run... \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Oh of course!  I dont think neither her or him are assholes here just both figuring out a very big change. Its a huge sacrifice too that i agree with", "Of course there is gonna be hardships that why i was saying he should do research and properly communicate so he can get through them. Going straight to a defensive \"youre choosing friends over me\" isnt gonna help them at all during this change.", "I mean, I probably wouldn\u2019t invite my partner either, but it would really depend on the other people. But I\u2019m reading this as \u201ca school friends/graduation\u201d type trip. If my partner didn\u2019t go to school with us and share in that experience, it would feel weird to me to invite him on a trip to commemorate the experience. Just like it would be weird to, say, invite your friends on your honeymoon.\n\nAs for the move, the timing is unfortunate, perhaps, but not the end of the world either. Like, if he arrived the day before, and/or she were leaving for more than say, a week (which she\u2019s not, this is 4 days) then I think there\u2019s more of a conversation about consideration to be had. But he\u2019ll be there for a week before the trip, which, unless he\u2019s truly helpless, should be enough time for him to get his bearings and know where the basics are. A 30 yo man should otherwise be able to entertain himself for a few days. They are, ostensibly, going to have the rest of their relationship to hang out. She\u2019s only graduating from this school, with these friends, once. \n\nI\u2019m a pretty independent person and the idea of spending any and all free time with no one but my partner does not appeal to me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy (for me) to have no friends or interests outside the orbit of a partner for various reasons. I also understand that being together constantly IS how many people live their relationships. Neither is inherently wrong, but it\u2019s usually bad news when an independent person and a less independent person get together. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here. \n\nLike, I GET the bf being bummed in the sense that they\u2019ve been apart for a while now, and they\u2019ve been looking forward to being reunited and starting the rest of their lives. But he should also understand that as someone who supposedly cares for and loves her, that this trip only has a very small window in which it can happen, and he should want her to take the opportunity.", "This is my thought, if he can speak the language, let him discover the city a bit. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s making him move in while she\u2019s gone", "Like a grown up person can\u2019t be on his own in a foreign country? How do people move abroad on their own?", "How the fuck are these the top comments when every other comment is a sane NTA? Don't listen to these idiots, OP. Unless you *want* to be in an unhealthy codependent relationship. It's 4 days and he's a grown adult. He'll be fine. What's a red flag is that he's *already* telling you that you can't hang out with your friends. That you need to put his temporary comfort over your once in a lifetime opportunity. *That's* a red flag.", "How is this the top comment?", "P R E A C H !", "I mean, could he not just chew through a few good books, play some games and/or unpack his stuff for four days whilst she goes and possibly sees all her uni friends in one place for the last time?\n\n\nFour. Days.\n\n\nFour.\n\n\nGood grief.", "Right?! She is going to be gone for 4 days. Sheesh, walk around your new neighborhood, be a tourist, enjoy yourself and in 4 days you can tell your GF all about it and she can tell you about her trip and then you spend the rest of your time together. If I was in BF position, I would be kinda bummed, but would never want my SO to miss out.", "[stolen comment](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gsfzm/_/jp85dwu/?context=1)\n\nPUZZLEHEADEDHAWK5604 is a bot, downvote and report!", "They've only been together for \"almost three years\", so being long distance for three to four years doesn't make sense.", "Why would it be the last time she sees her friends? If that's the case they aren't really good friends. OP said the school+her friends in the post, unless that sentence is just written oddly and/or additional info was written in comments. Maybe it's a grad trip? Then ya it'd be the last time to see a good chunk of her class together, but not her good friends.\n\nAgain, I'm referencing what I've seen on that TV show (but I also know some people who went through this in my life) where practically everyone gets super homesick, annoyed, and bored during the first few months until they can get settled-sometimes even when their significant other is at work for 10 hours during the week. Not because they are needy, but because they don't know anyone and have nothing to do, but are super social-used to hanging out with friends/family multiple times per day. Not the end of the world or anything, but you must admit it's odd OP didn't steer clear from these specific dates to go on a trip-no reason was given on the post as to why it had to be the week right after. In most countries school has been finished for about 2 months now, and knowing that she already planned for him to come live with her 8-10 months ago seems odd that she wouldn't try to plan the trip before he had arrived, no?\n\nOP may not be an AH, but they sound a bit inconsiderate at the least.", "Exactly. I would be questioning things if my male partner, who is 30, did this.", "Just play Tears of the Kingdom for 4 days if there's a language barrier. There's more than enough content for that, lol", "You kind of argue the opposing point here but backwards.\n\n\nOP may never see these people all in one place ever again. People she has just spent an important, formative part of her life with.\n\n\nMeanwhile, she and her BF have (hopefully) the rest of their lives to enjoy each other's company. \n\n\n\"You owe at least two weeks\" is such an arbitrary amount of time. Why 2 weeks? If the 'once in a lifetime' 4 days was just 7 days later then it would be acceptable? What is it that happens in these additional days that makes all the difference?\n\n\nIn reality, BF in this situation \"getting upset\" only serves to make her feel guilty - or worse - stopping her going. He should want her to go and enjoy this last trip with her friends because a respectful partner would want her to be happy and take an opportunity like this.\n\n\nI'm not tearing down OP's BF either, he may not yet be emotionally mature enough to see past his own \"need\" for her to be with him - that's something that comes with a bit of wisdom and self-reflection - but this is something that he needs to work on for both of them.\n\n\nTo be in a healthy relationship, each person should be comfortable with acting independently as much as they enjoy being together. Having your independence in a relationship just means that you are choosing to be with your partner because you love them, not that you're dependent on your partner because you have never learned to be content on your own.\n\n\nIt's something that takes more time for some than others and unfortunately some people just stay clingy and dependent and never learn to see past their own immediate needs. These can be the kinds of people who guilt trip their partner or are passive aggressive instead of just communicating healthily and effectively. \n\n\nOP - if you tunnel this far into the comments, I hope you and your BF can find a happy, respectful and emotionally mature place in each other and I hope you're very happy in your new life together.", "Yep don't miss the trip only miss the relationship when you get back and he is gone", "I completely agree! He could go on a trip of his own, he could explore his new city on his own, or maybe he could delay his arrival until she returns!", "Not to mention people move to new countries all the time, and often without a place to stay in advance. Does it suck a little bit that he's going to be alone after moving? sure. Is it a huge deal that should make you cancel a trip? no. \n\nIt's four days, if he can't handle 4 days alone there are bigger problems.", "What's a \"man card\"?", "So your saying he doesn\u2019t get to communicate his actual feelings unless they are only positive? He is uprooting his entire life for OP and she literally writes he didn\u2019t want to stop her, but he choose to be honest about his feelings, which should always be considered healthy, and now he\u2019s the bad guy? His feelings are just as valid as anything else. He\u2019s not trying to control her or guilt her, he\u2019s just honest. I thought we genuinely considered the fact that people are able to communicate their feelings to their partner as a positive thing and keeping your feelings locked up inside and lying about them as unhealthy. But maybe I\u2019m wrong.", "YES!", "What is disrespectful about going out of town?  He will be perfectly fine for 4 days.  He isn\u2019t dependent on her for his happiness or comfort.", "If they can't be bothered to stay in contact and plan another trip, then it's not really that important.", "He is moving to her, he did long distance when she decide to move\u2026", "Cmon, you don't need to argue in bad faith. When you try and frame it as merely \"going out of town\" and removing all other context, it kinda gives the game away. \n\nAlso, you appear to be lost. This isn't r/AmIDependentOnOthersForHappinessOrComfort", "So she should have sacrificed her university education so he didn\u2019t have to do a long distance relationship? Um, no. And again, THEY decided he would move. THEY planned. The 2 of them. Not her. He\u2019s an adult and could have said \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a long distance relationship and I don\u2019t want to move. He didn\u2019t. I really feel like you\u2019re glossing over the fact that he\u2019s a grown adult man. Even older than her, but you seem to think she\u2019s in control of all his life decisions. No. And if she is, he\u2019s got a lot more problems than just not being able to be alone with his thoughts for 4 days.", "Do you never go on vacation to places you never been to?", "As a person who has moved to a new country on the other side of the world, she\u2019s absolutely not TA for going on this trip. He\u2019s a grown adult, he can explore on his own for 4 days - it will actually be good for him to build his independence and familiarity with his new surroundings. I did the same thing when I first moved, going on walks by myself really helped me to build my mind map of my new home, because when you\u2019re with someone else it\u2019s easy to just follow them and not really think about the route you\u2019re taking to get to places.", "It's 4 days, and it's to mark a big achievement. If I were the bf, I would be mortified at the thought of OP *not* going on the trip for my sake.", "A red flag because she wants to go celebrate her achievement?\n\nHe is a grown man. Unless he is incapable of taking care of himself, sure. But I think by now he is ween off boob and potty trained.\n\nFfs its 4 days. So what if he will move to a foreign country. She can give him a crash course of surviving in the city before she goes away FOR 4 DAYS.", "At this age, it\u2019s pretty normal to be going on vacations to other countries where you don\u2019t speak the language by yourself. He wouldn\u2019t be settled in yet, but I feel like he\u2019d do fine for himself for 4 days. On the other hand, this could very easily be the last time she gets to travel with her friends ever again.", "I would be totally fine with it. It's only 4 days, and discovering a new place totally on my own is actually a nice thing. I would never hold someone back from rare opportunities to seize the moment just for my own interests.", ">**Put yourself in your boyfriend's shoes.**\n\n**I\u2019d be MORTIFIED if a partner treated me like a child & cancelled their graduation  /other important trip because they thought I couldn\u2019t frikkin manage myself for JUST 4 DAYS without them**, **even if it was in bloody TIMBUKTU**.  **For me, that would be a red flag** if they cancelled their graduation trip to stAy wiTh mE - how smothering as well as treating me like a child ffs.  The bf would have already arrived a week previous, she\u2019s not leaving him *on the day of* his arrival, *that* would be kinda disappointing.  smh", "I disagree, he's a 30 year old man and it's 4 days. They'll get a week together before she leaves for... four whole days. The red flag here is him not her.", "I also highly doubt he was told about this trip last minute. If the boyfriend was truly bothered then he could have pushed his move in date until after the trip.", "If you time it right it would actually give them a break from each other if they are struggling with the transition to living together. It gives him a chance to make his mark on the living quarters.

Like let her go on the trip. Y\u2019all ideally gonna be together forever right?", "If they're in a serious relationship... 4days out of the rest of their lives should be chump change. It honestly gives him the opportunity to explore his new home on his own, and play tourist for a few days, or even just relax at home and decompress before starting his new life. If a grown man can't handle 4days alone in a new place that's pretty rough honestly.", "> Its not like he doesn\u2019t speak the local language or something.\n\nHow sure are you of that though?", "Not even. 4 days. \ud83d\ude02", "It would be a very important fact to leave out. If OP isn\u2019t taking that into consideration than neither should we", "Ohhh. Thanks. I need to go review the options again.. Hah", "Perhaps moving to a foreign country isn't for you.", "Why do you feel that she needs to sacrifice her graduation trip for him? Why?\n\nWhy can a 30 year old man not keep himself company for 4 days?\n\nThese ideas of \"sacrifice\" and his entitlement to her time/sacrifice are from the wrong century.", "Doing research doesn\u2019t completely mitigate actually going through with something. He should definitely make an informed decision and be aware of the consequences but again it doesn\u2019t make it easy all of a sudden. \n\nMy only gripe is people acting like moving to a new country is nothing, OP\u2019s bf in particular is being a baby", "An ex partner did this to me - we were long distance, I moved to be with him in a new city far away from my family and friends. He took an OPTIONAL last minute night shift the night I arrived off the plane, a flight I had booked months in advance, and then didn\u2019t even take a day off work to help me settle in, although he could afford to. I gave up everything for us to be together and he just went about life as usual. Dude was a prick.\n\nMoving countries is a stressful, complicated ordeal, and if you\u2019re doing it for someone else you don\u2019t want to be doing it alone.", "Most grown adults are capable of being alone in another country.

This shouldn't be an AH thing either way. NAH.", "Yeah. There's also an easy solution if it is a big deal (maybe it's his first time leaving the country, idk) that could be him potentially tagging along? It doesn't have to be one way or the other, but the BF is definitely being overly sensitive. \n\nFirst week in a new country, I'd be exploring. If there was a trip with my partner that I wasn't able to go on it's NBD. Potentially insensitive of OP to not extend the offer to join (and celebrate) but we don't know all of the circumstances, or if there'd be a bigger reason for exclusivity. \n\nI'm feeling like OP's BF may be a like codependent or hostile haha.", "I think it gets lonelier in a new town when the only places you know are what someone else has shown you.

I was the same age as OP's boyfriend. I was fine. It was fun exploring, and even when I got lost I saw it as an opportunity to explore my new surroundings. I knew my addresses and could easily locate a taxi rank to get back.\n\nThe boyfriend is a grown adult, he doesn't need his hand held. He can spend the 4 days settling in, figuring out where the crockery and cutlery is, how to operate the washing machine, how the stove and microwave work, how the shower works, he could even just watch the TV to find programmes he might like.\n\nHe could find out where the nearest watering holes and food places are, how far away the supermarket, cinema, library and gym are, if there are any community events on that he could join, and he could get a feel of the neighbourhood and the local atmosphere. He could even meet his new neighbours in passing. \n\nThey're not going to be joined at the hip, he's going to have to do things on his own anyway, so the earlier he can acclimatise on his own, the better.", "I hope you don\u2019t own cats", "No, I am fairly new, and yeah, I am catching the drift.", "My cats have an automatic food dispenser and a water fountain.

I havent moved but even travelling somewhere for a few was a lot to intake even with a guide and research on my side. I mean it helped with stuff to do but fully settling is a whole different thing.
