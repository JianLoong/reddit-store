The last 3/4 years we\u2019ve been long distance on different continents cause I went back to uni. We planned for him to move to my country in the fall. \nNow I\u2019m almost finished with school and there\u2019s a trip planned for four days to a neighbouring country. I\u2019d really want to go, cause it might be the last chance to go with school and my friends there. The problem is, that trip is scheduled a week after my bf would arrive. I asked him and while he doesn\u2019t want to tell me no he\u2019s hurt as I would be putting friends and fun above him. \nI wouldn\u2019t go on a trip if he\u2019d just come for a visit obviously, cause time would be short. But since he\u2019s coming permanently I feel we have enough time for each other after. \nSo WIBTA if I go on that trip?", "created_utc": 1687507142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gsfzm/wibta_if_i_go_on_a_trip_a_week_after_my_long/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you moved to a new country and didn't know anyone other than your boyfriend, didn't know the area, etc., how would you feel if he left you a week after you arrived to go party with other people for a week, leaving you alone to figure things out?  \n\nYou said your boyfriend would understand but be hurt - is that how you want him to begin his life in a new country - hurt because his girlfriend put other people before him?  \n\nThe fact that you even have to wonder if YTA and would rather go on the trip than spend the time with someone who is supposed to be important to you makes me think you might not have as much time with him \"after\" as you think. That's a red flag!", "Unsure how to go if N A H or Y T A\n\nFrom one side, it's only 4 days.\n\nFrom the other, he just moved a week ago. He wouldn't have time to even be settled in and you'll already be leaving.\n\nIs there any way he could go on the trip too?", "Hard to say I\u2019m going with slightly YTA. He moves to different country just cause he wants to be with you and you are leaving him after just a week. Why i said slightly is cause I also understand your position it could be last time you ever see some of your friends from school", "Any way to reschedule that he can come AFTER the trip? It's 2 weeks later, maybe figure something out, you got time till fall.", "Can he not come with you?", "You wrote that he was hurt when you asked him. He moved to another country for you and you plan to abandon him the first week? That's a asshole move.", "Of course YTA. The guy is moving from another country and probably planned this for a long time, and suddenly you leave him and go for a week with college buddies? \n\nYou two obviously have to work a lot of things out and I feel sorry for the guy, because honestly if you are going to this I don't think you both are as committed. Would you have moved for him?", "NAH. There will be plenty of future opportunities to hang out with your bf, but you are finishing school and celebrating with friends from there so your reasoning makes sense. It's normal that he's a little hurt, but it's only a week out of the rest of your lives.", "The timing isn\u2019t great, but the trip is a one and done opportunity. Ngl I\u2019d think a lot less of a bf who couldn\u2019t deal with being alone for only 4 days in those circumstances. It\u2019s presumably not the first time he\u2019s been to that country and he speaks the language? Assuming it\u2019s yes to them then NTA (though I would think he deserved more attention if it was no)", "NTA - it\u2019s only four days! If it was like a week or more then I\u2019d lean to YTA. He can explore the new city on his own and relax for those days. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine.", "You would be the asshole. He's moving to the country for you and you want to go on a trip before his jet lag wears off leaving him where he knows no one. Where's the focus on him in your relationship? Take him for granted if you want to, just don't be surprised if he stops sticking around.", "Just because your boyfriend is moving locally doesn't mean that your life as an individual stops. There will be many times you will put friends and fun above him. The same goes for him. If he expects something different, that is a problem. Go on the trip with your school friends and have a great time with the knowledge that, in this instance, you are NTA.", "NTA (but leaning to NAH)\n\nThis trip is important to you, as it's connected to you wrapping up this stage in your life and isn't an opportunity you're going to get again. You're only gone for 4 days. \n\nI get that your bf is bummed, but as an adult, he's totally capable of handling himself for a few days while you're gone. I don't buy that him being in a new country matters - people solo travel all the time, and he's a grown adult who is totally capable of being independent for a handful of days. He should be able to zoom out a bit and recognize that him being bummed isn't more important than you missing an opportunity you'll never get again.\n\nIf he can't, then this is a lesson learned for you about his lack of independence, lack of ability to problem solve on his own, and him wanting to prioritize his short term comfort over your wants.\n\nWith that said - during his first week here, take some time together to sketch out some potential touristy things he can do alone. He should make sure he's set up with a transit pass, transit apps. Who knows, maybe you'll come back from the trip and he'll be able to introduce you to something new about your city :)", "YWNBTA He's got a week to settle in with you and time to sort out something for him to do for 4 days. It's 4 days, not the end of the world and he's a grown man, not a child. Go have fun with your friends \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "So, your bf sees this as some sort of competition? That you prefer your friends over him? I'm sorry about that. If I were in his shoes, I would understand you wanting to go on this final trip. NTA.", "NTA\nYou have the rest of your life to spend with your bf. Go enjoy one last trip with your uni friends.", "Mild YTA. I see both sides. But one week into moving in is uncomfortably short.", "YTA \n\nYour boyfriend literally moved to another country for you which he\u2019s been planning for years. He\u2019s in a new country and doesn\u2019t know anyone except you and you just want to go on a trip with friends. I understand wanting to meet friends but you can do that another time, your showing your boyfriend that your friends are your priority and not him.", "NTA. You have the chance for quality time before the trip - and plenty of time after.", "NTA. Life has to be lived. One week makes no difference. That\u2019s how events played out. There is no malice here. Tell him to grow up.", "NTA. I'm thinking along the same lines as you. How long after his arrival are you expected to exclusively wait on him before you having your own life is no longer considered selfish and like you love your friends more than him? Why is this even a competition? Why is it not okay to put your friends and fun above him? I don't know. I don't like it.\n\nI kind of understand that he would be a bit bummed out, but I don't understand actually making that an issue. It's literally 4 days. He's in a new country. He can play a tourist and have fun. You'll be back soon.", "Yta.", "YTA", "absolutely YTA. he's moving to be with you and you're just going to leave him alone in a country he doesn't know anyone in? really? don't do that.", "We all know where this is heading. Comes back from trip a little \u201cdistant\u201d. Then the trickle truthing, then your bf finds out one of your \u201cfriends\u201d you said not to worry about had a drunken night of fun.  You suck if you go.", "Honestly, it depends on your boyfriend, I was the one to move countries for my partner and honestly, 4 days wouldn't have killed me.\nIt looks like you would be ready to stay if he asks so please do. I would sit down with him and be very honest: you want to go but you are conflicted because he has just moved for you which is pretty big, lay it down as you just did and leave him the choice: it's either he gives his blessing and you go, or he does not and you don't go. \nThe only rule is: you have been honest so he needs to be honest too, neither of you can take it back, if he tells you you can go then he doesn't get to be mad at you for going and if he tells you to stay you can't be mad at him for asking.\n4 days is not that long, I know people who would be bothered, and I know people who wouldn't be. It all comes down to honest communication.", "I would go with YWBTA. It\u2019s only 4 days but y\u2019all have been LD and he\u2019s just moving to your country to be with you. It\u2019s unfortunate but it\u2019s definitely the AH move to go on the trip. You\u2019re talking about going on a trip for 4 days with the people you hung-out with the whole time you were LD with your partner. It\u2019d be different if you were bringing him on the trip to introduce to your friends.", "NTA. It's four days! You have a week prior to that to help him settle down. He has a place to live, get enough groceries or show him how to get food delivered, he can survive 4 days of his own. Rest up and chill at home after all the stress from moving. Have fun and congrats on your graduation!", "NTA - speaking as someone who went on a long weekend with the girls on my 4-week wedding anniversary and am still married 33 years later.\n\nIt's four days, not forever. And it's probably the last time all her college friends will be together, not something that can be re-scheduled. BF will have her undivided attention after that. Maybe his travel can be delayed by 2 weeks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
