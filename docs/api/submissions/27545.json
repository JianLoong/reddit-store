Yesterday we went to a winery, and I am not a big fan of wine, while others in the group love it. Because of this, I only ordered 2 glasses of wine. Other girls in the group ordered multiple Grolsches (1L) and bottles of wine, wine flights and multiple glasses. We also shared some appetizers. Before the bill came I said that I didn\u2019t want to pay for all of their wine since I only had my 2 glasses. When the bill came, my friend told everyone they owed $75. I reminded her again that I didn\u2019t want to pay for all of the wine they ordered and she said in a condescending tone, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know we were like that. It\u2019s weird to not split the bill, but okay.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m sensitive to rejection and shame, but the others at the table could tell how awkward this was and that she was truly annoyed. While they went to the outside bar, I stayed in the main building for a bit just to collect myself so that it wouldn\u2019t turn into a scene. However, when we got home she brought it up again passively saying, \u201cYeah, since (my name) doesn\u2019t want to pay the bill.\u201d This is where I stood up for myself and asked why it bothered her so much that I didn\u2019t want to pay for drinks that I didn\u2019t even have and she basically said that she just thinks it\u2019s weird to go out with a group and not split the bill evenly. She\u2019s saying all of this in a tone that is clearly talking down to me. I told her that it\u2019s fine that she feels that way, but it\u2019s not fine to make me feel badly about it and to shame me in front of other people about it. She kept telling me that she thinks it\u2019s weird and that I \u201cdo this all the time\u201d, but we have gone out to eat 3 days in a row now where I had no problem splitting the bill evenly because everyone shared everything/most things those nights. She then asks another girl in the group \u201cI think it\u2019s weird, don\u2019t you?\u201d To which that girl said \u201cyeah it is.\u201d \n\nThis made me feel alienated and embarrassed and I started to get emotional. I know that I\u2019m an emotional person, which I carry a lot of shame because I tend to be around people who are the complete opposite. I get that people have different opinions and etiquette, but I disagree with shaming people because you don\u2019t agree with them. \n\nSome context; I grew up in a 4 person family living in a one bedroom apartment and on food stamps for a while. I also work in healthcare and make the least amount of money while all my friends have corporate jobs where they make much more than I do. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for speaking up about not wanting to pay for all of my friends\u2019 wine at the winery when I only had 2 glasses?\n\nEDIT TO ADD INFO: The winery had it posted on their menu: \u201cONLY ONE CHECK PER TABLE\u201d.", "created_utc": 1695560096, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qx359/aita_because_i_didnt_want_to_split_the_bill_evenly/", "score": 250, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, who doesn\u2019t understand how unreasonable it is to ask people to split things evenly when someone had half as much as everyone else? I remember one time going out to a birthday dinner, and of course I was happy to split the bill evenly among all the non-birthday boys. But someone else noticed that I only had one glass of wine, and all the bigger drinkers at the table volunteered to pay more, and they ended up doing some complicated math of how many glasses of wine per bottle blah blah so that everyone paid a fair amount. It was totally unnecessary and way more confusing than if we\u2019d paid evenly (which I was totally fine with) but they all insisted. Even at the time, I thought this was such a nice gesture, but after reading this exact scenario again and again on AITA, it makes me realize that that kind of basic human decency and empathy is really rare and should be appreciated. \nNTA", "NTA\n\nCall it like it is: you drank much less so your friend wants to mooch by having you cover part of her bill.

If it's a bottle we are taking home to have with dinner together, I would if course pay, as their host.\n\nBut splitting the bill for a group buying bottles? Never even heard of that expectation.

VERY politely ask them if it's possible to pay for the items you had so that the rest of the group can split the bill more easily. Be prepared with exactly what you are ready to pay for, pay for at least one shared item in whole and TIP WELL. \n\nBring the new bill back to the group and let them know you took care of your portion already. You can be guilted into paying more, or hassled for making the process harder if you've already paid. \n\nObviously not all places will do this, and it's always better to ask in advance for a separate bill.

This right here is a lesson in being a goddamn gazebo of shade.\nBut also NTA. I don't know if this is a culture thing or just personal experience, but in my opinion even split on the bill is weird unless you're doing a shared meal situation (Chinese, tapas and some Indian for example).\n\nOtherwise you pay for what you got, just seems like the obvious answer? If I want to smash $20 cocktails with a tomahawk steak, that's my problem and others don't cop that choice.\n\nSame as if I'm not feeling like drinking, why would I be paying for your drinks?\n\nUltimately, people don't like discussing money issues or money in general so if people just pay for themselves there's no need for them to, they get what they can afford and everyone gets a night out.", "Don\u2019t forget the pinky-thumb hand drinky motion to the mouth thing too\ud83d\ude06, while looking around furtively. *Really* drives that point home. \n\nI\u2019ve heard. *Shifty eyed.*", "I meant before ordering.", "Ask her why she thinks you should be obligated to subsidize her heavy drinking.", "Actually I'd say she is quite nasty judging by the behaviour you described. Sounds like she wants to mooch off of you.", "I disagree because she says they normally evenly split the check. If she\u2019s okay with splitting the check when she spends a little more she would be the AH for not returning the favor. But $30 isn\u2019t the same as $5.", "Yes", "Awe - that's adorable! Lovely family :)", "Oh, I see the point you were making now!"]}
