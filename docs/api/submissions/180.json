Growing up my mom did most of the childcare and home chores (she has a part time job too) and my dad has a full time job (runs his own construction business).\n\nHowever lately I have been getting upset about my dad\u2019s lack of involvement in our lives. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he lives with us and pays our bills and isn\u2019t absent or anything. But we only ever see him for about half an hour at suppertime and then he goes into his bedroom to continue working or to read or generally be by himself. I know he has a physically difficult job and so he often just wants to relax when home, but still. He never helps with our school work (especially my little sister\u2019s), he rarely comes to our school events (plays, Latin quiz, little sister\u2019s hockey), and he never drives us to school (he actually was angry at me and at my mom last week when she was unable to pick me up and he had to drive me home one time: compared to the hundreds of times mom has dropped everything to come pick us up). At dinner when we do see him he constantly complains about his work and we never get to speak. I know it is their agreement that mom cares for us youths and dad works, but I wish he was at least a little more involved.\n\nAnyway, a lot of our house revolves around our dad. We try to be quiet when he is home so we don\u2019t interrupt him. We don\u2019t do laundry when he is home in case he wants to do a load of his own. The majority of the groceries my mom buys are suited to his taste and almost all the meals are made to his taste. Usually this is nbd, but lately all these things have been bothering me and it came to a head tonight.\n\nMy mom cooked pork with apples and rosemary, as well as turnips with butter. I hate this entire meal, but my dad likes it. My little sister is lactose intolerant, but my mom puts butter in the turnips because dad prefers butter over margarine. When dad saw that I wasn\u2019t eating much he huffed and called me picky. I blew up at my parents then, saying I wouldn\u2019t be picky if mom sometimes bought groceries that I or my sister liked. For example, I like macs but not pink ladies: but mom always buys pink ladies because that is what dad likes. My sister hates radishes but mom always puts them in our salads because that is what dad likes. And I went on about the different things mom always cooks to dad\u2019s taste.\n\nAnyway, my mom got a little teary eyed and said she just wanted to feed everyone well, and my dad got angrier and sent me to my room for being picky. I know I should be extremely thankful they are feeding us well and putting a house over our head, but I (and I know my little sister does too) often feel like we are second thoughts compared to my dad. AITA for getting angry over this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Edit: I do cook regularly, and when I can I cook dairy free for my sister. I do sometimes buy groceries, and when I can I buy some food for my sister and I to keep up in our bedrooms or at school.

Your dad is the center of the family universe and expects to be there\n2. Your mom is extremely accommodating of this dynamic\n3. Your parents ignore your and your sisters food preferences but still expect you to eat food you hate\n4. Your parents don't care for your sister's medical dietary restrictions  \n\n\n\\#1 and #2 are rough. Depending on what resources and support you have access to, you might be able to get help now, or it might be just a little bit later in life. But these are\u2014unfortunately very common\u2014but extremely well-known and well-understood family dynamics. There are books and coaches and counselors out there to help you with all of that. I don't know exactly what that looks like in your part of the world but I can promise you it exists.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I can tell you that your father's day-to-day behavior is very selfish. He is choosing to minimize his involvement with his own family. And it is not reasonable to be angry at needing to manage an ordinary household activity such as picking up kids from school. And wanting to spend family dinner time complaining about his own day vs. his opportunity to ask you and your sister about your days... that is very self-absorbed behavior and you are right to be bothered by it.\n\nOn to #3... as someone who has fed a lot of teenagers, it doesn't sound like you and your sister are unusually picky for your age. Turnips and rosemary are both very strongly-flavored foods and it's really normal for younger people to be bothered by strong flavors, based on how our sense of taste develops. My kids are in their 20s now and they will eat so many things they would not touch ten years ago. So, you're not being unreasonable if you prefer not to partake in certain foods.\n\nA food can be delectable for one person and inedible for another. Lobster, mushrooms, and cheese are just three examples of foods that are the best thing some people ever ate, while other people would literally experience a gag reflex if they tried to eat them. There is nothing wrong with saying \"no thank you\" to foods you can't stand. You may find some of those foods become more palatable to you later, so do keep trying them. But refuse them all you want.\n\n\\#4 The most concerning thing in your narrative is that your mother doesn't appear to be taking seriously your sister's medical food restrictions. If you can't persuade her not to harm her younger daughter's health in general, perhaps she could be persuaded to make some accommodations.

We try to be quiet when he is home so we don\u2019t interrupt him. We don\u2019t do laundry when he is home in case he wants to do a load of his own. The majority of the groceries my mom buys are suited to his taste and almost all the meals are made to his taste. Usually this is nbd, but lately all these things have been bothering me and it came to a head tonight. \n\nMy mom cooked pork with apples and rosemary, as well as turnips with butter. I hate this entire meal, but my dad likes it. My little sister is lactose intolerant, but my mom puts butter in the turnips because dad prefers butter over margarine. When dad saw that I wasn\u2019t eating much he huffed and called me picky. I blew up at my parents then, saying I wouldn\u2019t be picky if mom sometimes bought groceries that I or my sister liked. For example, I like macs but not pink ladies: but mom always buys pink ladies because that is what dad likes. My sister hates radishes but mom always puts them in our salads because that is what dad likes. And I went on about the different things mom always cooks to dad\u2019s taste. \n\nAnyway, my mom got a little teary eyed and said she just wanted to feed everyone well, and my dad got angrier and sent me to my room for being picky. I know I should be extremely thankful they are feeding us well and putting a house over our head, but I (and I know my little sister does too) often feel like we are second thoughts compared to my dad.

She is an adult and a mum, but she is also a woman, and has most likely grown up in a world teaching her she is second. Try to keep this in mind; the grossly deep roots of misogyny and toxic masculinity run beyond what you can anticipate. \n\nIt took years, and it continues to be something we need to monitor, but my mum changed first, and when she did, he did too. \nMy sister and I worked hard on mum, educating and listening. It took for her to realise she deserved bare minimum respect before she started to believe there was a problem. \nMy dad was more work, but he too has changed. In times of stress he'll revert to putting her down, but he knows none of us are here for it. Most importantly, mum steps up and stops him before he gets far, and dad knows he is wrong and on occasion apologises. As he understands more about his feelings and understands how his upbringing has influenced him, he regains power over his actions, and sees he is not who he is now because of it, but Inspite of it.

A financial provider is not a parent, and a parent needs not be a financial provider. Tell him you need, deserve, and expect better from him.

The remarks are pointedly about him. He knows this.)\n\nI disagree with those saying there was a better time for this conversation for xyz reason. There wasn't. This was the only time you could have shoved his shitty actions in his face because where else would he go? He wants to eat his meal, so he's not going to go anywhere. When he fucks off after dinner, he avoids interacting with everyone else and makes his displeasure with any interruption known. Who's to say he wouldn't get physically violent the moment you corner him? He can also say, \"I don't have to listen to this in my own house!\" and out to the streets with you. He could've also done that at dinner, but not with the kind of audience he had. He wants to come off as benevolent for graciously allowing you shelter and food so long as you follow his his-word-is-law. Alone, he can twist the events of your conversation to make him look as though he has been wronged. A meal times, everyone knows how the conversation went and wouldn't believe that he'd been wronged.\n\nAlso, mom is supposed to be your advocate, fellow victim status aside, because that is how being a parent works.

I don't consider the things I mentioned as extra work, but I could see how they could lead to more.", "No seriously. I stopped eating meat at 13. Neither of my parents liked it but accepted it. When my mom made dishes she would make me something else. When she made baked ziti I got my own mini own. When she made stuffed peppers I got a pepper stuffed wt veggies instead. Once I got older it was up to me but for the first few years she made my own dishes when she made meat. She kept meatballs separate from the spaghetti so you add it on after and didn\u2019t just mix it all together. There are some very easy solutions to the food part here.", "My daughter is allergic to tree nuts.  I often bake, and some things I bake have nuts in them.  So I do exactly what you suggested.  Making florentines?  I do a few before I add in the almonds.  Making hedgehog slice?  I'll sometimes make it without the walnuts.  It's not that hard.  It takes very little extra effort.", "Exactly. And it won't 100% eliminate the issue but it could improve it significantly. It's such an obvious partial solution that I'm wondering if doing that would somehow upset the dad as well.", "But again, with as unhealthy as it is, I would recommend not adding margarine to anyone's since there are other alternatives to butter that aren't as bad.", "So you\u2019re well aware of the wrath your mother would face if she made something he doesn\u2019t like.\n\nYour mother has a responsibility to protect\nYou from abuse. That\u2019s true. \n\nShe\u2019s also a victim. If that means you have to pick out radishes or your sister has to make a separate side, ok. You lashed out at the wrong person.", "Good for you.   It sounds like your dad is a handful.  You\u2019re NTA for getting upset with your dad over all his demands, but try not to take it out on your mom, as she\u2019s just trying to do her best in a difficult situation.  Maybe work more with your mom to help plan meals with more options for you and your sister, and go grocery shopping with her so you can get snacks you like as well.", "He\u2019s emotionally abusive. When she doesn\u2019t cater to him he punishes her.", "I don\u2019t mean to make a jump here, but does he abuse her? The way you describe her fear and tiptoeing makes it sound like there\u2019s something deeper\u2026. I truly hope not, but that\u2019s what it sounds like", "Yeah\u2026 I can see that.", "And yet you fail to understand this mother is trying her best for her family. \nWhat happens if dad gets upset? What happens if they divorce? Mom probably wouldn't have the finances to keep her daughters as spoiled as they are right now. What if the dad ends up with full custody?", "What I\u2019m going to say is brutal, but so be it. I\u2019m sure you care about your little sister, but I think you\u2019re just using her condition to give your complaints more credence. Like you know people are going to say cook for yourself but you can go \u201cbut my little sister\u201d. If you\u2019re so concerned, cook for her too. Or maybe your sister doesn\u2019t eat the stuff with butter in it.", "this may get down voted but try talking to your  parents see if they would be willing to let you have a part time job. one  you can do on weekends or a few hours after you get out of school.", "No. Butter literally has only trace amounts of lactose, the only way you could be affected is if you're actually *allergic* to lactose, not just be lactose intolerant. Trace amounts are literally too little to do anything to someone who's even 100% intolerant, because that's just an inability to digest it, leaving the wrong type of gut flora to digest it instead. Trace amounts mean there's still little to none for those gut flora to do anything with.", "Yeah fair enough buddy. She definitely would benefit from you laying out calmly what you see and how your family dynamic impacts your life. It\u2019s possibly she really doesn\u2019t see it as a problem, which is deeply weird but it may help if you approach her as an adult who wants to understand rather than a kid who\u2019s mad at her parents. At the very least maybe you can come to an understanding by finding common ground so both of you can get through life with less stress. \n\nSorry it\u2019s so crummy for you, that sucks.", "Another good thing to do is work hard at school and get out of there soon as you can, hopefully provide somewhere for your sibling to escape to in time too.", "I dated a guy whose parents were like that. Once his mother was driving home from dropping my boyfriend off at college (a 3 hour drive) and I was in the car with her and her husband called whining about when she was going to be home because he was hungry. When we got engaged she asked what kind of cake I wanted for my engagement party and I said I liked gold cake with chocolate frosting and she said \u201cmy husband doesn\u2019t like that kind. I\u2019ll just do vanilla.\u201d It was baffling to me", "You a projecting *a lot*. Nowhere in this post does OP say her dad is an asshole.", "It is normal to do things that a spouse likes however it\u2019s also normal to do things your children like. \n\nIt sounds like dad isn\u2019t involved with the kids at all and yet he still has total control over the household - not being able to do normal every day things like laundry just in case dad might want to is not normal.\n\nETA: in a comment below OP stated that when mum makes something dad doesn\u2019t like he doesn\u2019t thank her and gives her the silent treatment for days so I\u2019m gonna go all in and say that to me this does show a pattern of abuse.", "I\u2019m pissed no one gives a shit what mom wants. What, her opinion doesn\u2019t matter? Maybe she likes radishes too.", "Doing what makes your spouse happy is great. Not giving a shit about what makes anyone else in the house happy is not, and that's not even considering making foods one of them can't even eat.", "Exactly this. Everyone wants something from mum, noone gives her anything.", "He has never gotten physical (that I know of) but when I was young he often yelled. Nowadays he doesn't shout anymore, but he does huff and puff around the house. On days like that we make sure to stay out of his way, and there have been a few times where mom has sent my sister and I over to stay with our grandparents.", "I mean so what if she is? the complaint is still valid. I\u2019m only mildly lactose intolerant and my parents make everything dairy free when I visit, even though they are huge cheese lovers. I cannot imagine what 1950s housewife dynamic justifies serving allergens to your children just to appease your husband. OP and her sister are still dependents, and telling them to \u201cbuy their own groceries\u201d is ridiculous. parents need to provide for their children that\u2019s the whole job", "What you said is true for clarified butter, not the \"normal\" one. It still has a non-negligible amount of milk serum (not sure of that term, english isn't my native language, but I mean the water-based fraction of milk), which could be bad for SEVERE intolerance.", "Eh? It\u2019s all over the post: never engages with his kids, whinges when he has to drive them one time, demands that food be made to his tastes even though one daughter doesn\u2019t like it and the other physically cannot digest it\u2026 if you don\u2019t think he\u2019s an AH you need to recalibrate your radar.", "Pretty sure she's internalized that her opinions don't matter - and neither do anyone else's, just the man of the house. It's really sad all around for anyone.", "So it sounds like yes, he is abusive towards her. I\u2019d highly recommend re-centering your frustration on him and trying to have some grace for your mother.", "So you decided to emulate your dad by yelling at your mother. YTA.", "[deleted]", "Mum is an enabler and OP is allowed to have feelings about that", "OP is clearly mad at both mom and dad. dad sucks, and mom is not only enabling him, she\u2019s actively catering to him at the expense of their children. both of them hurt OP", "[deleted]", "She's mad at both of them and she took it out on... Both of them", "No she isn\u2019t. She clearly and rightfully is mad at her mom too. I hope you feel better now that you have bashed a 17 year old today."]}
