Depending on the dress style, I am anywhere between three different sizes. But wait, if it's designer sizing, I have to size up one. Sometimes. But wait, there's more! I'm tall, so even if a dress fits my body, it may be several inches too short. And depending on how they cut the dress, one size may be too small to even zip, but the next size up looks like a potato sack. Who knows! Oh, and to add yet more insult to injury, you have no clue what the dress is going to do on your body until you try it on. It might cling in all the wrong places, it might be sheer, it might gap in very awkward spots. What looks fabulous on a model specifically picked to show the good points of the dress may look catastrophic on someone else. So when I order clothes, I get multiple sizes in various styles, cross my fingers, send up prayers to various deities, do a good luck dance, and hope that I get ONE decent looking piece of clothing. I track that shipment, and I'm ready to try on everything the day it arrives so I can make sure I get everything back in the box and sent back the next day. \n\nMy husband though?

The bricks-and-mortar stores have little product in stock so you have to order online, try things on at home, and return the things that don't fit. As long as she returns the dresses promptly, it should work out, but if your wife is a procrastinator then she may run out the return window and that would be $$$$$. What I do is I buy 3-4 at a time, try them on, take pictures while holding up a sheet with the size I'm trying on. Return them, and then order another few. Since the final dress will be rather pricey, it's probably worth it to do this rather than just pick the best of 3 dresses since it's possible none of the first 3 she tries will be any good. Otherwise she may end up either having nothing to wear that looks nice, or wearing something that costs a lot of money but doesn't look very good. If you are worried about putting money on the credit card (a totally valid concern) then you can either agree on how much you are comfortable charging at one time before she returns the rejected dresses, or you can keep track yourself of the order dates and return dates, and make sure the rejected dresses get returned within the return window (take note: stores are now giving us MUCH less time to return things than they were pre-pandemic). I also try to use stores that have a bricks-and-mortar store near me, as most will take returns in the store of products bought online (check on this first). This saves you on the return shipping. I also look out for deals where you get free shipping if you order a certain amount of stuff, and I try to plan my clothes shopping in advance of a fancy event so I have plenty of time to try on multiple dresses without having 8 dresses on my credit card at once.\n\nSo I would say that how this goes, depends on whether your wife is a conscientious person or not.", "NAH.

That's exactly what I paid for mine.  \n\nIf she has time and you're worried about putting it on the card I'd say she should just order each dress in one size and if it doesn't fit return and order in the other size. \n\nAlso, surprising to me....Amazon carries a lot of the same dresses and designers that nordstrom/dillards/saks carry but the shipping and returns are a lot faster.", "Nta but she isnt either, i will explain\n\n\"Try on and return\" is picking the right size, all dresses under one shop will all come under one shipping cost not each of its own. Maybe ask her to pick dresses from one website if your worried about 3 shipping costs from 3 websites. \n\nIf she also returns the dress that fits her after the gala ended, well you got your 280$ back and she you can say wore a dress on rent for the shipping cost. Which usually isn't much, if your in the same country as the shop, its usually less, but if your outside, i havent seen shipping being over 25$ anywhere. \n\nWell so conclusion is, so with either your 75$ she got to rent 3 dresses for events, or with your 915$ she keeps the 3 dresses she bought, rest returned.

Not $3.99 each, it was for the whole pack! \n\nIf you want more suggestions, head over to r/abrathatfits - we'll totally help you out!", "Same with h&m here (at least in Germany). The day they moved to online only, I stopped spending my money there. I don\u2019t mind shopping online but this attitude really pisses me off.", "The sneakers my son wore for years were \u201credesigned.\u201d He\u2019s a 13 4E at the moment. I\u2019ve ordered 15 pairs of shoes so far and he tried on over a dozen at the one store (a specialty running store) within 50 miles of my house that even sells shoes in wide widths or over a size 12 in the store. \n\nIt\u2019s a nightmare and he is down to one pair of shoes for school that are falling apart. He has his shoes he wears with his referee uniform but does not want to wear those regularly since if they get ruined he can\u2019t ref.", "Depends on how much credit you have - if you have 100,000 in credit, 5 isn\u2019t going to matter.", "Doesn\u2019t change that you\u2019re borrowing money to do that. And yes money is relative but we\u2019re talking about what\u2019s normal/reasonable. I don\u2019t think most women are buying 5k of dresses on a credit card to try to time it right and return them.", "Okay, but what happens when you experience a shipping issue one day? Because it's going to happen, if not to you then to someone else. Packages go missing, shipping companies fuck up and they won't always end up helping you when that happens.\n\n/u/BlueAtolm shared a similar story to what I've seen working customer support. People tying up a shit load of money banking on returns, then the return goes missing and the store won't help them out until they either get their package or their insurance money from the shipping provider... Which doesn't always happen.\n\nCan you afford to lose that 5 grand if that happens?", "Was just going to mention this. I've got an inseam 4 inches off of norm, and shopping for pants sucks. Spent the entirety of high school in knee-high boots over jeans since that was the style, and it's practically the only thing that saved me from high waters.", "I have stupid feet: wide, oddly shaped, in a size that's hard to find in both women's AND men's, and to top it off they're different sizes (I know no one has both feet the same size but one of mine is literally in another shoe size than the other, so I either buy two sets of shoes or wear things that can be tied/velcroed/whatever tighter). Last time I started looking for new sneakers I started in February, visited every store that sold shoes at all in my city and the city I worked, drove 2 hours and spent 6+ hours trying on shoes in the mall, and then started ordering shoes offline two at a time, trying them on, and returning them. Finally got new ones in July, long after I'd worn a hole in my old ones and was wearing same-colored socks hoping no one would notice. (I ordered 2 identical pairs and am praying they still make that exact shoe next time I need some).\n\nHaving to do the buy-online-try-return dance sucks, but depending on where you live and what OP's wife's body is like (too tall, too short, too wide in this spot, too thin in that spot) it may be literally the only way she can get something that fits flatteringly.", "I\u2019m surprised you were even able to return them. When I worked at Nordstrom prom dresses were non-returnable because of the high instances of return fraud (shitty people would wear them to prom and return them).", "Thank you!!!"]}
