Depending on the dress style, I am anywhere between three different sizes. But wait, if it's designer sizing, I have to size up one. Sometimes. But wait, there's more! I'm tall, so even if a dress fits my body, it may be several inches too short. And depending on how they cut the dress, one size may be too small to even zip, but the next size up looks like a potato sack. Who knows! Oh, and to add yet more insult to injury, you have no clue what the dress is going to do on your body until you try it on. It might cling in all the wrong places, it might be sheer, it might gap in very awkward spots. What looks fabulous on a model specifically picked to show the good points of the dress may look catastrophic on someone else. So when I order clothes, I get multiple sizes in various styles, cross my fingers, send up prayers to various deities, do a good luck dance, and hope that I get ONE decent looking piece of clothing. I track that shipment, and I'm ready to try on everything the day it arrives so I can make sure I get everything back in the box and sent back the next day. \n\nMy husband though? Oh, he can order his usual size and be just fine 90% of the time. Once in a while, a shirt is slimmer cut or looser cut than he anticipated and he has to exchange it.

The bricks-and-mortar stores have little product in stock so you have to order online, try things on at home, and return the things that don't fit. As long as she returns the dresses promptly, it should work out, but if your wife is a procrastinator then she may run out the return window and that would be $$$$$. What I do is I buy 3-4 at a time, try them on, take pictures while holding up a sheet with the size I'm trying on. Return them, and then order another few. Since the final dress will be rather pricey, it's probably worth it to do this rather than just pick the best of 3 dresses since it's possible none of the first 3 she tries will be any good. Otherwise she may end up either having nothing to wear that looks nice, or wearing something that costs a lot of money but doesn't look very good. If you are worried about putting money on the credit card (a totally valid concern) then you can either agree on how much you are comfortable charging at one time before she returns the rejected dresses, or you can keep track yourself of the order dates and return dates, and make sure the rejected dresses get returned within the return window (take note: stores are now giving us MUCH less time to return things than they were pre-pandemic). I also try to use stores that have a bricks-and-mortar store near me, as most will take returns in the store of products bought online (check on this first). This saves you on the return shipping. I also look out for deals where you get free shipping if you order a certain amount of stuff, and I try to plan my clothes shopping in advance of a fancy event so I have plenty of time to try on multiple dresses without having 8 dresses on my credit card at once.\n\nSo I would say that how this goes, depends on whether your wife is a conscientious person or not.", "NAH.

That's exactly what I paid for mine.  \n\nIf she has time and you're worried about putting it on the card I'd say she should just order each dress in one size and if it doesn't fit return and order in the other size. \n\nAlso, surprising to me....Amazon carries a lot of the same dresses and designers that nordstrom/dillards/saks carry but the shipping and returns are a lot faster.", "I would have said yta on the go to the mall thing, but i will go with NAH, since she is using your money and your confused. \n\nOkay so first of all, malls dont have appropriate dresses for events like this. Malls at most will only have appropriate dresses for teenagers's parties. \n\nSecondly, women do shop this way, only because the sizes of every shop is different.\n\nI will give an example, i wear size 39 shoes but its a bit small so i was looking for shoes in size 40. Size 40 in a different store came very tight and when i returned it the 41 size was gone but the same shoe was available in another store in which size 41 was way too lose.\n\n\"Try on and return\" is picking the right size, all dresses under one shop will all come under one shipping cost not each of its own. Maybe ask her to pick dresses from one website if your worried about 3 shipping costs from 3 websites. \n\nIf she also returns the dress that fits her after the gala ended, well you got your 280$ back and she you can say wore a dress on rent for the shipping cost. Which usually isn't much, if your in the same country as the shop, its usually less, but if your outside, i havent seen shipping being over 25$ anywhere. \n\nWell so conclusion is, so with either your 75$ she got to rent 3 dresses for events, or with your 915$ she keeps the 3 dresses she bought, rest returned.", "I have never shopped this way in my life.

I\u2019m so anxious, half the time I just keep the clothes I don\u2019t like to avoid having to return them.", "How about buying a Ma\u00dfband next time you over-order?", "Okay, but it\u2019s proportional. OP said he can afford it, so that isn\u2019t the issue. I know plenty of people in the perfectly average wealth bracket who order lots from chosen retailers, try everything on and send 75% back.", "It doesn\u2019t work that way with women\u2019s clothes. Honest measurement info? Haha, wishful thinking.", "Out of 10 brands, maybe 1 or 2 will have honest measurement info. Out of all the brands that have that, how many will have the items I'm looking for? How many of those will not be sold out? How many of those will deliver to where I am? Your solution is nice in theory, but in practice, I often can't even get what I want when trying *all* possible brands. Now imagine limiting the options to only those with \"honest\" measurements, which I can't even know until I try.", "I\u2019ve tied this and it just doesn\u2019t work. Women\u2019s clothing is a mess. You can measure all you want and follow the measurements. It\u2019s really frustrating.", "You can only know how \u201chonest\u201d the measurements are after you tried the on. Fit is also a thing - whether a fabric has stretch or how it is cut will alter the way it looks on your body. \n\nYou\u2019ve been making some real AH assumptions about women\u2019s clothing and bodies, availability, and people\u2019s personal financial situations - and then trying to justify it by citing the environmental impact. Which is better - everyone in town individually driving to shops, which has to be lighted and heated and where the clothes are supplied from a warehouse. Or bypassing the shop altogether, sending the clothes directly to a customer via one delivery truck. Are we supposed to magically know how accurate measurements are without trying clothes? \n\nOnline shopping generates up to 40% less carbon emissions. You can\u2019t know how a gown looks without trying it on, even with accurate measurements - which can never be assumed. Moreover trying on clothes isn\u2019t just about measurements, it can be about to feel of the material or whether the colours on the screen look the same in person. How often are you buying women\u2019s formal wear or wearing it? If the wife is going to try on different clothes online has less impact than in person.", "The problem is that most stockists don\u2019t put returned clothes back out on the racks (metaphorically speaking). They usually end up in landfill once you\u2019ve sent them back.", "The environmental impact has many facets. Here's an interesting article [Impact](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/31/what-happens-when-we-send-back-unwanted-clothes)", "Too loose is better than too tight for most things. You want to hold it so that the tape is level all the way around and comfortably touching the measurement bit without pinching you or hanging unevenly. Try measuring in a store fitting room so you can use the mirrors to check it's straight.", "How about noticing that there are not always measurements given and clothing sizes are not universal and differ extremely?", "The sad thing is it does exist, rare as it is.", "How about not sh*tt*ng on the environmental impact, but preferring brands that work responsibly?", "No company will admit to creative measurements.  I think others have described in great detail how difficult it is to shop and all the details involved."]}
