Depending on the dress style, I am anywhere between three different sizes. But wait, if it's designer sizing, I have to size up one. Sometimes. But wait, there's more! I'm tall, so even if a dress fits my body, it may be several inches too short. And depending on how they cut the dress, one size may be too small to even zip, but the next size up looks like a potato sack. Who knows! Oh, and to add yet more insult to injury, you have no clue what the dress is going to do on your body until you try it on. It might cling in all the wrong places, it might be sheer, it might gap in very awkward spots. What looks fabulous on a model specifically picked to show the good points of the dress may look catastrophic on someone else. So when I order clothes, I get multiple sizes in various styles, cross my fingers, send up prayers to various deities, do a good luck dance, and hope that I get ONE decent looking piece of clothing. I track that shipment, and I'm ready to try on everything the day it arrives so I can make sure I get everything back in the box and sent back the next day. \n\nMy husband though? Oh, he can order his usual size and be just fine 90% of the time. Once in a while, a shirt is slimmer cut or looser cut than he anticipated and he has to exchange it.

The bricks-and-mortar stores have little product in stock so you have to order online, try things on at home, and return the things that don't fit. As long as she returns the dresses promptly, it should work out, but if your wife is a procrastinator then she may run out the return window and that would be $$$$$. What I do is I buy 3-4 at a time, try them on, take pictures while holding up a sheet with the size I'm trying on. Return them, and then order another few. Since the final dress will be rather pricey, it's probably worth it to do this rather than just pick the best of 3 dresses since it's possible none of the first 3 she tries will be any good. Otherwise she may end up either having nothing to wear that looks nice, or wearing something that costs a lot of money but doesn't look very good. If you are worried about putting money on the credit card (a totally valid concern) then you can either agree on how much you are comfortable charging at one time before she returns the rejected dresses, or you can keep track yourself of the order dates and return dates, and make sure the rejected dresses get returned within the return window (take note: stores are now giving us MUCH less time to return things than they were pre-pandemic). I also try to use stores that have a bricks-and-mortar store near me, as most will take returns in the store of products bought online (check on this first). This saves you on the return shipping. I also look out for deals where you get free shipping if you order a certain amount of stuff, and I try to plan my clothes shopping in advance of a fancy event so I have plenty of time to try on multiple dresses without having 8 dresses on my credit card at once.\n\nSo I would say that how this goes, depends on whether your wife is a conscientious person or not.", "NAH.

That's exactly what I paid for mine.  \n\nIf she has time and you're worried about putting it on the card I'd say she should just order each dress in one size and if it doesn't fit return and order in the other size. \n\nAlso, surprising to me....Amazon carries a lot of the same dresses and designers that nordstrom/dillards/saks carry but the shipping and returns are a lot faster.", "Nta but she isnt either, i will explain\n\n\"Try on and return\" is picking the right size, all dresses under one shop will all come under one shipping cost not each of its own. Maybe ask her to pick dresses from one website if your worried about 3 shipping costs from 3 websites. \n\nIf she also returns the dress that fits her after the gala ended, well you got your 280$ back and she you can say wore a dress on rent for the shipping cost. Which usually isn't much, if your in the same country as the shop, its usually less, but if your outside, i havent seen shipping being over 25$ anywhere. \n\nWell so conclusion is, so with either your 75$ she got to rent 3 dresses for events, or with your 915$ she keeps the 3 dresses she bought, rest returned.

I'm in a smaller town and it's a trek to find a store with plus sizes, let alone black tie appropriate dresses where they will order different sizes for you.
