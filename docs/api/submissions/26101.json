The two are not even remotely comparable.", "NAH\n\nYou are not entitled to bring your kids to weddings. It is quite normal to have weddings without kids. \n\nIf you really can\u2019t swing it to find someone to watch the kids then you are fine to decline the invite. \n\nChoosing your bday is a bit odd on your brother\u2019s part, but you don\u2019t actually seem upset about that and didn\u2019t provide any context for why they wanted that date so I\u2019m not prepared to call them assholes for it at this point.", "Nah just send a 'no' and then a nice card.  If people say 'no kids' they don't get to be pissy when patents decline.", "NAH. You've said you want your kids to come, they've said they don't want them there. Your wife was a bit of an AH for not respecting their wishes, but they're a bit of an AH for basically ensuring you won't see your kids on your birthday. \n\nThere's a dynamic I think you aren't considering here. Decade birthdays are typically milestones, right? But so are decade anniversaries. Your 50th birthday is going to be their 10 year anniversary, your 60th their 20 year anniversary. The dynamic with the \"kids\" will change as they get older, but the kind of people who plan weddings on the groom's sibling's birthday are probably not the kind of people who are going to appreciate people aren't celebrating them on your birthday. There's nothing you can do about the date, but there is a boundary you set up for ongoing expectations.", "Nah they invited, you can decline.", "NAH, but if it were me I would RSVP no to the wedding.  I know me, personally I enjoy spending my birthday with my child, and have for all 13 years of her life.  I personally have fun with my munchkin for my birthday because she's always more excited to celebrate my birthday than even I am.  She says it's mommy's day so she needs to be celebrated.  \n\nIf they want to have a kid free wedding that is their choice, and their right, but they will have to accept that there will be people not attending due to childcare concerns, yourself included.  If you have other family members with children that live a distance away from the wedding they probably won't be attending either.  If your stepbrother, and his fiance have a problem with that then that's on them for the choice they rightfully made.", "You are bordering into asshole territory with thinking your kids should be the exception to the no kids rule and thinking they are angels.  Everyone thinks their kids are better than they are.  They aren\u2019t assholes for choosing a no kid wedding and you aren\u2019t an asshole for not going if it\u2019s going to be a burden on you to get childcare.

It's normal to not have kids at a wedding, but I would think about what you truly want to do and what the long lasting impacts will be for that decision.  Also, is the wedding venue at a hotel?  You could always all go and look online for a Nanny service to care for the kids in your hotel room while you are at the wedding and can go check on them whenever you wish.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo go to the wedding or don't go. BOTH is fine.", "NTA. I personally wouldn't waste a babysitter on that. Sorry that's just how I feel. I personally think 9 and 6 are fine to go to weddings. My daughter has been going since she was 4 almost 5 sat there no issues. No way in heck would I leave my kids with someone in a strange city I found on a nanny website (please don't get pressured into doing this). The other option sucks too. Would absolutely not do it. It's also a big birthday. They can create their own rules but they have to live with the consequences. Weddings don't have to be fair. I'd book a family trip or plan a special day just you and the family or get a local trustee babysitter and go out just you and your wife. So sick of parents getting bullied into these child free (out of spite sometimes less face it) Uber expensive destination weddings that doesn't even include the years salary in babysitter it would take to get someone to watch your kids for the weekend. And eff going to alone without your wife. That's expensive misery right there. She's stuck at home solo parenting and your at wedding spending all your family vacation making polite small talk with people you don't know or extended family you haven't seen in forever. Hard NTA", "NAH I say this as gently as I can, your kids aren't as special to other people as they are you.  They aren't precious angels that should have the rules bent for them because it makes them and you happy.\n\nWedding invites are just that, invites not court summons.  You can decline for any number of reasons.  I don't understand the hype behind birthdays that end in 0, I just see it as another birthday.  However, I get that people class them as milestones. So if you want to decline to spend your milestone birthday with your kids then do so.  Offer to take your step-brother and new wife out for a meal after to celebrate their status as newly weds but understand the relationship with them and your step-mum may be shit.  You're not going to please everyone in this situation so you might as well make yourself happy.", "Nta, their expectations are kind of unreasonable given it's a big birthday for you... Of course you'd want to be with your kids for it. I honestly would think it's weird they want it on your birthday even if it wasn't a big one, or if you didn't have kids", "Stepbro,... Celebrate your birthday with your family. NTA if no show to his wedding summon.", "It\u2019s normal to have a wedding without kids. Don\u2019t go.", "NAH", "NAH.. You mention \"I can overlook my birthday issue. In fact it seemed fun and quirky, and I figured we as a small contingent would break away at some point and go do something. But the no kids is rough. I WANT to be with my kids for a big birthday.\"\n\nThing is.. You need to work around them or you need to miss the event... this is their wedding, not your 40th birthday party. You're not the best man so your part in the wedding is minimal other than showing your face.. They don't want children at the wedding, and you're trying to push that they be there.. What are you celebrating at this event, their wedding or your birthday?\n\nHonestly, I don't remember anything about my 30th or 40th birthday.. they're not as big a deal as you're trying to make them.. Best option is skipping the wedding and spending the time with the kids if it's that important to you. You'd be a big A-hole if you tried to force the issue by showing up to the wedding with your kids.", "I'm sorry but your wife was an AH. She had absolutely no right to give the bride a hard time for having a child free wedding. The fact that she gave the bride such a hard time that she broke down crying is really disgusting behaviour on your wife's part. Your children are not entitled to attend.\n\nNow for your 4 options - this made me think you actually have no concept of what makes an A H because none of those options make anyone an A H. All of those options are fine, when you host a childfree wedding you need to anticipate that some ppl can't make it because of childcare. Personally, I'd go with Option 2, let the kids have a nice weekend with your wife's parents and attend the wedding, but that just me.\n\nThe only part where I do think you have an issue is that due to your own poor planning for your own wedding ppl where put out or given short notice to attend. Essentially, by being inconsiderate of others you created a precedent that they don't need to be considerate of you.", "Nta just tell them that since your kids aren't invited you will stay home and enjoy your 40th birthday with your family.", "NTA when people set standards for their wedding they risk people being unable to attend. Period.  I would NOT leave my kids with strangers!!!!! Never!!!!!\nCall step brother and say you\u2019d love to come but y\u2019all can\u2019t in good faith leave your children with a stranger or drive with the expense to leave with family.

A kid-free wedding is a kid-free wedding. If you want to celebrate your birthday with your kids, do it elsewhere. The wedding is NOT the place to do it.", "My sister got married on our nephews birthday and had a child free wedding. Their reasoning was that alcohol would be flowing and they didn't want anyone to not have a great time because they had to chase after kids, or deal with the I'm bored coming from them later in the evening. My sister adores all of our nephews but the date was the only one that worked for majority of the family. She did however pay for accommodation on site so that they could be near and parents could sleep over. Is it possible to bring the kids and hire a sitter close by?", "YMBTAH.  Sounds as if you are close with this stepbrother and that is why I think you might want to consider getting your kids to their grandparents for a fun few days there while you and your wife attend the wedding.  The birthday can be celebrated later with your family, I think your young children will be okay with that.  In the long run, I think all the effort this will require will be good for you and your family's connection.  I get it's not how you'd prefer things to happen, but this no-children in attendance choice is not your decision to make and it's really not worth hard feelings going forward should you decline to attend over it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You having to travel makes it more difficult but you also have a year to figure it out.\nYou NOT going wouldn't make you an ah either if you decide it's just not something you can swing.\nStop pushing and just decide if your going or not.", "None of that makes a difference to the bride/groom. If it did, they would have made the exception without your input. You\u2019re not an asshole if you don\u2019t go, no one is going to call you out for spending a milestone birthday with your wife and kids.

Go to the area as a family, you go to the wedding, then meet up with your family and celebrate your birthday.  Easy.", "First, context doesn't matter, they are entitled to have a kid free wedding and your wife was an AH for in your words \"gave her (bride) a hard time\". Do not excuse your wife's bad behaviour as being either cultural or without a filter. If your wife chooses to talk in an unfiltered manner then she needs to accept that her behaviour may harm others and that harm is her fault. Additionally, she has no right to apply her cultural norms on other ppl. None. The rule was applied evenly, she can choose not to come but she cannot choose to be a loud mouth bully because she  wanted to try and override the couple's decision on their event. Unacceptable behaviour.\n\nSecond, sometimes weddings fall on ppls birthdays. You don't have a monopoly on the day. There's no etiquette that says the bride and groom must consult all guests about the wedding date. Once you narrow down to a time of year and a venue you frequently only have a couple of dates to choose from. Personally, I find giving short notice (especially if anyone had to travel) is way more inconsiderate than holding it on your birthday. I mean really, has this actually negatively effected you? You are an adult, have a party the weekend before or after. You and your unfiltered wife aren't the centre of someone else's wedding.", "As someone who just turned 40 and whose friends have all turned 40 in recent years or will in the next few years, I agree.

It's not about me or my birthday. It's their wedding and I am happy for them. I don't want to introduce any additional drama beyond the initial knee-jerk reaction. \n\nHas is negatively affected me? Yes, actually, absolutely. There is a rift between my father and I and my children that seems to have started over this. My children have not grown up with family around them. My father and stepdad mother seem to have little interest in them and don't understand what it's like growing up far away from the rest of the family. \n\nIt's a shitty situation. I need to support my wife's feelings in regards to family first. I want to also support my brother with his wedding. I will end up being an asshole to someone in the end regardless of my decision, and that was the point of the entire post. Sorry that was lost on you.", "Your brother's wedding is not about the rift in your family nor did it cause it. Plenty of close families have child free weddings, while plenty of distant ones include children. \n\nYour wifes response to the children not being invited is the negative effect not the lack of an invite. The additional issues you have with feeling like your father and step mother aren't involved enough has nothing to do with this wedding.\n\nI've been a family lawyer a long time. While I would say that all marriages are different there is some commonality in the truly good ones. One of those is the ability of a person to support their partner, while at the same time telling them when they are wrong. Your wife is wrong in expecting other families, with different value systems to adopt hers and you should be able to have the conversation with her respectfully. Your wife needs to a) reflect on how your joint choice to raise a family far away impacts the potential to build relationships she apparently considers a priority, and b) learn not to judge others priorities just because they aren't hers.\n\nYou aren't entitled to a picture postcard family - especially when your own choices to live far away made that impossible. If your parents are polite to the children when they see them, remember their names and make the occasional effort to ask them a question then you have no right to ask for more and neither does your wife. Grandparents aren't parents. They owe your children nothing above basic kindness. \n\nAll the negative effects are entirely of your own making. Don't place that onto your brother's wedding and stop letting your wife disrespect the different way your family deals with relationships.\n\nAlso, just curious, for your short notice wedding did everyone from your side have to travel to attend? If they did I think you really need to examine why you and your wife think it's okay to expect substantial effort on short notice to celebrate you both is okay, but the same effort with a much more adequate timeframe to plan for your brother isn't.", "Don't go. They want a child free wedding fine. Don't bend over backwards for these people. Totally ok to ask for an exception they said no. I think all of the options of going are too burdensome in you guys. They don't sound like they'd do the same for you. Like as a parent myself not wasting a babysitter, travel money, or if your inlaws will take them the favor of a full weekend of babysitting on this nonsense. Save that up for a weekend away with your spouse. Weddings are working vacations. Enjoy your birthday."]}
