{"id": 29319, "submission_id": "17c9rux", "title": "AITA for being upset that my friend invited her bf", "selftext": "So my friend and I (pretty close, have been friends for a few years shy of a decade) have gone on this trip for a few years now together. Occasionally we\u2019ll invite other friends but for the most part it\u2019s always been just the girls. This year she has a bf she\u2019s been dating for almost a year. They\u2019re super sweet and slightly clingy, but he\u2019s a really good guy and I\u2019m happy for her. She asked me this year if she could bring him, or if I\u2019d rather it be a girls trip. I told her that I would rather it be a girls trip. I\u2019m not dating anyone, and she\u2019s one of my only friends so I don\u2019t have anyone else I could invite for when I inevitably third wheel. She seemed okay with that and told her bf. \n\nWell, the festival is three days, and halfway through day two, she says he\u2019s on his way up to see her and wants to spend the night. He\u2019s already 2-3 hours into this drive, and she asks me if that\u2019s okay. I told her that since he\u2019s already on his way, I don\u2019t mind as long as she doesn\u2019t completely ditch me. She said she wouldn\u2019t. \n\nBut it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t even exist when he got there. Im pretty independent and don\u2019t usually get jealous, but this trip was supposed to be a girls trip and we had planned all kinds of fun things to do and now they were all out the window. And that night we met up with some other festival friends for dinner down the road, and they disappeared halfway through, so I ended up hanging out with our mutual friend and her bf. \n\nWe get a call a little later from her wondering why we left while she was getting engaged to. \n\nDidn\u2019t even know it was happening. Her bf had said he wasn\u2019t sure when he was going to do it (we knew he had been planning) and didn\u2019t even prepare us so we could be ready to congratulate her. The rest of the trip was all them being clingy and happy (not bad, but again, it was originally supposed to be a girls trip). I don\u2019t think I\u2019m jealous, bc me being single is a choice, and it\u2019s more about being blindsided when we had plans. \n\nI\u2019m super happy for her, but I keep feeling guilty cause I\u2019m upset that the entire weekend just felt down the drain. I almost would have rather not gone at all bc the festival just wasn\u2019t as fun. AITA for being upset my friend invited her bf/fianc\u00e9?\n\nEdit: I do want to say that she only found out he was coming after he reached the two hours mark, and that was when she asked me. She didn\u2019t just decide to keep it from me. I was upset that she didn\u2019t tell him to turn around and head home, but then that makes me feel bad since he was already so far into the trip.

Your friend and her fianc\u00e9 seem very immature. \nNot much you can do other than making sure you always have an escape plan.", "NTA, and maybe it's time to reconsider your friendship? You clearly stated your boundaries, which she ignored.", "NTA she had agreed on a girls trip and to hit you with \u201che\u2019s 2 hours into the drive \u201c was wrong.", "NTA - This was a girls trip. Your friend asked if she could invite her bf and you said you'd like to keep it a girls trip. She invited him (or agreed he could come later) regardless of your feelings.   You have every right to be upset.", "NTA. Your friend sounds really self centered", "NTA but it\u2019s time to make some more friends. She\u2019s made her priorities clear and that would be fine- if she could be honest about it.", "NTA they completely hijacked the trip. You were quite clear about your feelings and she ignored them anyway. She doesn't sound like a very good friend.", "NTA \n\nHe did this on purpose, so now when you are mad about him being there, it\u2019s because you are \u201cjealous of their engagement.\u201d I would be fucking pissed if my bf did that specifically after I told him he wasn\u2019t welcome, she just let him. \n\nPay attention, drop her now.", "Nta. I see that you say she didn't know he was coming until he called. Either she didn't tell you the truth or he, knowing he was not welcome on the trip, knowing that she was on a girls' trip, and knowing that she'd feel guilty that he would have to turn around after so long a drive, gave her a surprise that is kind of uncomfortable, even if he immediately made the trip about the engagement. \n\nYou mention he seems like a clingy but otherwise sweet guy that she's been with nearly a year, but this doesn't sit right- does he often interfere with her relationships like this? Not that I'm crying she should dtmf yet, nor do I think the pink shades are coming off your friend any time soon, but this sounds like something I'd watch. She's not being a great friend in this instance, but the pessimist in me is hoping she won't need one.", "NTA ... Honestly I'd not make any more plans with her alone because he doesn't respect boundaries at all. It went from being a girl's trip to her engagement. Be there for her. Spend time with her but never alone. Make sure there is always another person included in the plans.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
