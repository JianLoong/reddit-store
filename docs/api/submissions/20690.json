{"id": 20690, "submission_id": "14jxeqy", "title": "AITA for pointing out that my mother-in-law's constant lateness is a character flaw?", "selftext": "My wife's mother has always been horrible with time management. She's constantly late to things, even things that cost her money. For example, she's received multiple parking tickets for not feeding meters in time and has paid penalties to doctors and dentists offices because she didn't get to appointments on time. Whenever my wife, who is very punctual, asks her about this, my mother-in-law just throws up her hands, as if this is the way things are and there's no possible way things can change. \r  \n\r  \nRecently, my dad celebrated his birthday, and we invited the whole family over for dinner to our house. I clearly communicated by email exactly when and where the party would be, so there should have been exactly zero confusion. The rest of my wife's family lives out of state, so only my MIL and her new husband would be coming. Well, the night of the party, my extended family all showed up on time, and they were ready to eat, so my wife and I suggested that we all start. \r  \n\r  \nAs we were having dinner, my MIL and her husband walked in and seemed genuinely surprised that we had started. I sat there with a smirk on my face. They were not going to ruin another event because they were too dumb to plan out their time. I felt really good about finally making them take responsibility for their failures. However, later on in the evening, my wife told me that they were offended that we started without them. I told my wife that it was her mother's decision to be late and if they genuinely didn't want to be late, then their IQs weren't high enough to plan out their day so that they could arrive on time. \r  \n\r  \nMy wife seemed mad, as she just walked away without saying anything and sort of avoided me for the rest of the evening. When the guests finally left, however, she tore into me. She said that I was totally out of line to insult her mother like that and that it was neither malicious nor a sign of low intelligence. My wife simply said that some people have different skills than others. I laughed in disbelief. I'm in my late 20's and don't expect the whole world to accommodate me for being late. I told her that her mother was acting entitled and that I would never bow to her narcissistic and ignorant tendencies. I also questioned how she functions as an adult if she can't even tell time. \r  \n\r  \nLong story short, my wife slammed the door of the bedroom shut in my face and has barely spoken to me in days. Personally, I think she's being childish and nearly as dumb as her mother, and I don't think I need to apologize whatsoever. However, I'm worried that perhaps she views the situation differently. I just want my wife to understand that her mother is either being rude by being constantly late, being stupid for constantly being late, or being entitled by constantly being late and that none of these are good character traits, but it seems like my wife wants to give her mother a pass merely because she's family. I'm really just at a loss about how she can be so illogical.

YTA.", ">then their IQs weren't high enough to plan out their day so that they could arrive on time.\n\nYou made a good point in the most asshole-ish way possible....so, yeah, YTA", "YTA\nFirst off, you're not trying to get your wife to admit it's a flaw. She has, but she knows it's not the end of the world. You're trying to get her to think less of her mother.\nThere have been many opportunities for adult conversations about this. You or your wife could've approached them about the chronic lateness, and asked for them to try to be more punctual. You could've told your wife it wasn't rude not to wait for them, that it'd be more rude to expect your other guests to accommodate their lateness. (especially since it didn't actually impact the dinner. she waited until after to communicate their feelings. an opportunity for YOU to COMMUNICATE yours.)\nAnd for whatever reason, you're weirdly hung up on this being an \"intelligence\" or \"malicious\" thing. Everyone has \"character flaws\". Some people struggle with time management, and some struggle to have  a mature relationship with their wife and in-laws. :)", "YTA. You weren\u2019t wrong for starting the meal on time, or finding your MIL\u2019s lateness frustrating in general.\n\nThe frankly deranged rant you went on, and the insults you\u2019re levying against both your MIL and your wife, make me hope very much you are seeing a mental health professional for your anger issues.\n\nSome people are chronically late. It\u2019s annoying, it\u2019s fine to not accommodate them. But the degree of animosity you\u2019re displaying for a very common \u2018character flaw\u2019 is\u2026concerning at best.", "YTA because you took the specific conflict about lateness and made it about something else entirely.\n\nIt IS annoying when somebody is chronically late. People who are constantly late to events don't need to be catered to or given excess consideration. However, this doesn't require a character assessment on their flaws as people, just consistently sticking to the plans that they were informed about. Either they'll adjust or they won't, but they can't say they haven't been warned.\n\nYou went AH because you're taking this personally, as though it's being done to bother you specifically. But most people's bad habits and flaws aren't directed at others, most of the time it's just pure thoughtlessness. You want to be right so bad that you made yourself wrong.\n\nEdit: typos", "YTA for how you said it. You owe her an apology for disrespecting her mother and her like that.", "YTA- it\u2019s not okay that she\u2019s always late and it\u2019s okay that you started eating without her. But the insults and name calling absolutely 100% make you the AH. You are clearly one of those people who thinks they are smarter than everyone else and honestly you sound insufferable.", "YTA \n\nYeah, it\u2019s super annoying when people are chronically late. That doesn\u2019t mean you get to insult your wife\u2019s mother. Punctuality has nothing to do with intelligence. And honestly, I\u2019m about 90% sure your MIL has ADHD that was never diagnosed, treated, or managed. Now none of that means she gets a free pass to waste other people\u2019s time. But it is worth considering that not every brain functions exactly like yours. \n\nMaybe you should work on that character flaw of yours where you use your own frustration as an excuse to completely devalue another human being and boil their entire personhood down to a single bad habit. Maybe you should work on the part where you do it knowing you are hurting your wife and do it anyway. Or the part where you throw around diagnoses like they\u2019re adjectives. One would think your IQ is high enough to know that words have real meaning, right?", "YTA - I really enjoy situations where someone is right and still the asshole for some reason.\n\nYes chronically being late is super annoying and yes someone who is that should be able to recognize it and adjust for it.  Hell your wife clearly wasn't hanging banners for MIL because she (apparently) agreed with the decision to go ahead and eat.\n\nI'm not sure what drove your decision to be condescending and confrontational with your wife but how you conducted yourself makes you the asshole.  Good job, that.", "YTA. You called your wife's mom stupid because she runs late to events. And now you are confused if you are the asshole? Lol", "YTA \n\nThere was really no need to insult MIL\u2019s intelligence to make your point. And you\u2019re really wrong about lateness being a sign of low IQ. And you should know better than blatantly insulting your in-laws to your wife, unless YOUR IQ is just too low. Signs do seem to point to low emotional intelligence here\u2026", "WOW\n\nYTA\n\nThere's actually a skillset that has been studied multiple times. People who are always late have a hard time remembering and guessing how long things take to do. It's similar to a sense of direction. Late people guess that a 40 minute drive takes 20. They do their hair the same way every day and think it's a 5 minute task when it takes 10. It has nothing to do with IQ.\n\nYou aren't superior to anyone with a lower IQ either btw. You did nothing to influence your IQ, it's a birth trait.\n\nTell your mother in law a time that's a half hour earlier than everyone else. Stop acting like a condescending jerk.", "YTA I do not believe the veracity of this post, however for the sake of argument, here are a few examples of where it went sideways:\n\n>I sat there with a smirk on my face. They were not going to ruin another event because they were too dumb to plan out their time. I felt really good about finally making them take responsibility for their failures.\n\n>I told my wife that it was her mother's decision to be late and if they genuinely didn't want to be late, then their IQs weren't high enough to plan out their day so that they could arrive on time. \n\n>Personally, I think she's being childish and nearly as dumb as her mother, and I don't think I need to apologize whatsoever. However, I'm worried that perhaps she views the situation differently.", "YTA, you didn't need to throw the insults at her mother. You're the one acting childish. If the woman is late, that's her own fault. You shouldn't have to delay eating or anything else because of one person when everyone else is on time. However to say MIL has a low IQ and such, especially to her daughter and then wonder why her daughter is mad, sounds like you have the low IQ.", "YTA - Your mother and law shouldn\u2019t be late but you are rude and disrespectful of your wife and her family, so that\u2019s worse.", "N T A for starting on time and not waiting for MIL.\n\nYTA for how you spoke to your wife (and continue to speak about her in this post). Holy high horse, Batman.", "YTA, bro.\n\nNot everyone is like you, and that's okay. It also doesn't mean that they're dumb, flawed, or ignorant; it just means that they're...not you!\n\nIt was perfectly fine to start on time if you chose to. But, it seems doubtful that your MIL was intentionally late (she always is, and not just to your events); it also seems pretty clear that you had all the intention of making her 'pay' for her 'failures' in front of everyone. That's where it gets AHy. The MIL's constant tardiness might be annoying, but you were nasty.\n\nThere was no need to insult your MIL while speaking to your wife. You could have just said that it would have been rude to keep everyone else waiting. But stating that someone's mother must have a 'low IQ' because she's never on time is way more offensive than arriving late to a dinner party.", "YTA.  While you are in full right to start meal without waiting and you are correct seeing constant lateness as an issue, you intolerable smugness of someone who think they are better alone is enough to make you an A. The fact that you went after your wife just confirms it. Honestly, if this post is any indication of your character your wife should get out of marriage ASAP", "YTA - Why are you seemingly taking delight in escalating conflict? They could have easily been the AHs and been late but are you trying to find conflict?", "While I agree that starting dinner was ok to do. I didn't realize you had zero character flaws and achieved a level of perfection where you can literally insult someone's IQ level.\n\nYTA", "I\u2019d start looking for good divorce lawyer. YTA", "As someone with ADHD and Autism (and a normal IQ lmao), who struggles with time management I think YTA.\n\nYou don't have to accommodate, however, being late has nothing to do with \"being stupid\" or having a low IQ. \n\nI'm happy for you that it's not something you struggle with, but you just because you're \"so perfect\", doesn't mean other people are stupid for struggling with stuff like this.\n\nCommunicate as an actual decent human being instead of insulting your MIL.", "ESH. Had you said - Your mom needs to be considerate of other people\u2019s time. You would have gotten a lot more n t a votes.", "YTA. If you had said that you didn\u2019t want to make everyone wait to eat to accommodate your MIL being late, that would have been fine. You have every right to do that. But you made yourself an AH with all of the completely unnecessary insults that weren\u2019t even accurate. Being able to be on time has nothing to do with IQ. I know several people with IQs over 140 who can\u2019t manage to be on time to save their life.", "You can tell the poorly written fakes when the poster says they smirked.", "ESH - I can\u2019t stand chronic lateness. Your in laws sounds horrible that way. But you went way overboard and should never have said what you did.", "YTA insulted her at her husbands party in front of people, explain how you don\u2019t owe her an apology? \u201cAs dumb as her mother\u201d she\u2019s reconsidering you right now, most intelligent thing she\u2019s done in y\u2019all\u2019s relationship.", "ESH.\n\nI mean,  gloating and calling your wife's mother stupid was definitely not the way to go,  but it would also be ridiculous to make everyone wait indefinitely if the in-laws can't even be bothered to text a status update when they leave the house.", "NTA, regarding your frustration with MiL. NTA with regard to starting the meal without her, but YTA in how you communicated your frustration to your wife. Your wife is being immature by not speaking to you. She knows her mum is a problem in this area, but she's going to be defensive of her regardless. She's obviously used to the poor organisation (ADHD?) disregard for the value of others time, etc. When your wife gets bored of her tantrum, try to explain that you will avoid expressing your frustration with MiL in that way again, and that you want your wife to regulate her emotions in a more mature way, and to communicate these rather than use them to punish you with silence...very destructive tactic in a relationship. \n\nI had similar stuff happen with partner of MiL. They turned up late to family events and expected plans to change around them. They were shocked one Christmas Day to arrive 2 hours late to Christmas breakfast (because partner of MiL didn't want to get up early), and find me and my family packing up for a long drive to have Christmas Lunch with my brothers. They saw their grandkids (my kids) for about 20 minutes. Their time keeping improved slightly, for the following couple of events, but it didn't last. I just stopped being frustrated and disappointed in the end, because it was their choice to miss out on connecting with their grandkids. Sad, but some people are just AHs.", "ESH - A.) You didn't have to make your point that way. it was a BIG jerk move.\nB.) You said, \"... my wife and I suggested that we all start.\" IF she did suggest you-all start, why is she mad? Then she's an AH as well. If she didn't, you're speaking for her and you're still TA. \nC.) Your MIL & (S)FIL (You called them \"... my MIL and her husband\" - so either FIL or Step-FIL) are AH for turning up late and EXPECTING everything to wait for them. Truly, they are the biggest AH in a whole story, if we're comparing. I *hate* people like that. The thing that I have done in the past is tell the \"late\" people that the event is 45 minutes earlier than it is. OR you can just tell them that it starts \"promptly\" at X O'Clock, and we will not wait for stragglers.", "Talking as a person that routinely is late you are not the ahole. I assume any responsibility of me being late, unless there was a mayor event like a crash or something. Also, I do not expect people to wait for me or make special arrangements for me being late, although when is my turn to wait, usually  I do not mind. So your MIL should have not taken offense if you started without her. A good solution would be to tell her an earlier hour than what is actually going to be.", "NTA.  The truth hurts.  Her mom knows what she is doing.  All the late people do.  I have died on this hill before.  Stand pat.", "NTA  My husband tells me to pick it up, move it out. (Leaves the Rawhide reference out). \n\nShe is wrong. Is she on time on her own or is it you. I (60F) and trying to get better with my arrive times.", "ESH.", "NTA. I used to have this problem, it was resolved by family who started telling me events started earlier than they actually did, eg dinners planned for 6, I was told started at 5:30. I'd arrive in time. I also started backing into arrival time, figured out travel time to destination and time to dress. It all helped me arrive timely.

Once you insult people they stop seeing reason.\n\nYou are right to start events on schedule. She has no reason to be on time if everyone is willing to accept her rudeness. It is wrong to starve your guests or ruin a lovely meal due to one person's lack of consideration.", "YTA for all the remarks afterwards. It wasn't wrong to go ahead and eat. But you went way outta line. You owe your wife a sincere apology.", "YTA. You used your justified annoyance as a weapon to put your MIL in her place, and then acted absolutely beastly to your wife and her family. You lost any high ground you had.\n\nThere is more than one type of intelligence, and I worry that you are exhibiting signs of a very low emotional IQ.", "YTA.\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing by starting without your MIL, and I agree that chronic lateness is a terrible and inconvenient thing to others. But you also attacked your wife\u2019s mother, called her names, and questioned her intelligence, all of which makes you an AH.", "Exactly what I was going to say.", "Calmer\u2019n you are, dude.", "THIS.  Exactly this.", "My most charitable reading is that OP has been seething about feeling like he *has* to cater to her lateness and now the dam has burst and so he's acting disproportionately, which is why it's so much better to set reasonable boundaries early on than be an angry doormat. \n\nStarting the meal without MIL? Absolutely the correct move. And MIL getting offended that her lateness wasn't accommodated is an AH move, people who struggle with time management need to understand that many many other people view time differently. But OP is taking it so weirdly personally and with such vindictiveness? It's not his problem if MIL has to pay a parking ticket, it's not even his problem that MIL is late for dinner--he already did the right move by just leaving her out of the equation and starting on time. But looking at starting on time being a way to \"stick it to her,\" and equating time management to intelligence is just...weird.  \n\nOP, there is a middle ground between catering to someone's lateness, and lashing out because of something that already is not materially affecting you.", "I agree. Not accommodating their lateness is perfectly ok. Hurling insults about MIL and to wife makes OP TA.", "Speaking of mental health professional\u2026are we sure MIL doesn\u2019t have undiagnosed ADHD? Poor time management is like *the* main symptom of ADHD in women.", "Yup, this definitely could be the kind of time blindness caused by ADHD or similar.\n\nThere are a number of constructive ways to navigate this situation and you are spot on with your assessment here as to why this was an AH approach to solving a legitimate point of frustration.", "It's pretty common in folks with ADHD, which is an ADA recognized disability, just to really drive home how AH-ish OP is being about this.  I'm not armchair diagnosing the MIL but would really love people to just stop and think \"what if\" - what if this person has a forkin' disability that I'm crapping on them for?  What if this person is doing their best?", "Not being able to remember how long it takes to do something you do everyday sure sounds like textbook stupidity to me.", "Post like these shock me. I\u2019m middle aged and I just haven\u2019t run into assholes likes this too much. Guess they do exist though.", "It\u2019s not okay to be late", "A mature person can admit their parents flaws", "It was the OP\u2019s father\u2019s party, not the MIL\u2019s husband, but that shouldn\u2019t change the judgement.", "Also the weird pleasure in \u201cpunishing\u201d MIL. Ugh.", "I am a chronically late ADHD person though i have been doing my best to be on time and have made many strides at bettering my perception of time. I completely understand if my lateness inconveniences others that i will need to deal with it so if things start without me it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. (In fact i routinely work late and on Saturdays so i often need to be late to functions anyway due to my schedule.) If i have a consequence i deal with it and don\u2019t get upset. That\u2019s the thing that bugs me about MIL here, she expects everyone to cater to her. I think it\u2019s ESH, MIL shouldn\u2019t have that expectation but damn OP is just dripping with disdain. Like dude I\u2019m sorry you hate your MIL but maybe cool it on such gleeful schadenfreude.", "Does her husband have it too?", "It's not okay to be late to court or to work. To a party/dinner, though? I think the rules are more lax, IMHO, but we can agree to disagree. However, I do believe that arriving late should not come with the expectation that everyone else wait for you.\n\nWhat's definitely *not okay* is insulting/disparaging your MIL when speaking to your spouse if said MIL didn't do anything to deserve that level of shaming. Calling into question her IQ, as if that has anything to do with anyone's character/worthiness, is especially wrong. But of course, both things--being late and demeaning someone--can be wrong at the same time. I just happen to think that the latter is worse here.\n\nI'd gladly break bread with someone who's late over doing so with someone who's a smug AH. JS.", "They also understand that someone having flaws doesn't give carte blache to be bully.", "I see and no it doesn\u2019t. OP making a scene is way more embarrassing and a bigger deal than tardiness of a guest.", "OP showed them, didn\u2019t he! Boy did his in-laws deserve to be showed up the way he showed them up! Now everyone can see what awful people they are! OP for the win!!\n\nYTA. If OP\u2019s mother-in-law were ONLY late to see HIM, and was on time for everything else, while I would understand it, because he doesn\u2019t sound like anybody I would rush to spend time with, still, he would be entitled to take it personally. \n\nBut if OP\u2019s mother-in-law is late to EVERYTHING, gets parking tickets, misses appointments, misses planes, leaves things to burn in the oven \u2026 then it\u2019s not about him, and it\u2019s not a character flaw. It is time blindness, and it has caused his MIL an untold amount of trouble her whole life, and I bet she has tried everything to deal with it, and nothing has worked. And her smug under 20-something son-in-law deciding to embarrass her about it and then rant to her daughter at length about how she is morally flawed? How was that going to help, except that it gave him a nice little flush of smug superiority, \u201csitting there with a smirk on (his) face\u201c? \n\nIt must be nice for OP to be so perfect that he can be totally unforgiving of anybody that fails to meet his standards. It must be nice to feel as if he has the moral authority to insult and embarrass his mother-in-law, at a dinner party, without the slightest doubt of his own rectitude.\n\nI do not know why OP\u2019s mother-in-law is habitually late. I do know that she will have done everything she can to combat it. I do know that there are neurological issues that cause time blindness. ADHD is one, but it\u2019s not the only one. I do know that it never crossed OP\u2019s mind to ask why she\u2018s always late; he thinks he already knows - it\u2019s because she\u2019s a bad person. I do know that his smug self-congratulatory priggishness says a lot more about OP than it does about his MIL.\n\nAnd I do know that I would be happy to have dinner with OP\u2019s mother-in-law, even though I know she\u2019d be late. I would happily wait for her. I would bring a book. But I wouldn\u2019t be willing to eat with OP.", "Believe it or not, but some couples actually WANT to show up to events together, even if they arrive late.", "My point is the husband should have been telling her to get her ass moving so they wouldn't be late."]}
