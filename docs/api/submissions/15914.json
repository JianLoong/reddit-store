My teammates and I are kind of frenemies. We get along and can work together, but sometimes I feel that they dislike me and don\u2019t respect me personally.\n\nTwo of my teammates - let\u2019s call them Angela (17f) and Jeff (17m) decided this year to pull a prank on me as part of the senior tradition. In the past people have filled rooms with balloons, silly stringed teachers, etc. mostly harmless pranks. This year they decided to target me to \u201crazz the robotics team captain\u201d.\n\nAs I was walking into our lunch room on Wednesday I was drenched in nasty lake water, muck, and other pond scum from the atrium balcony. Angela and Jeff had dumped one of the enviro science \u201cecosphere\u201d on me. Basically a jar of pond life.\n\nIt was gross and of course I was embarrassed. A few other robotics team kids jumped out and laughed about the prank, took a picture and some actually helped me clean up. Angela also dropped *the jar* on accident and magically it didn\u2019t hit me or even break when it hit the ground.\n\nI was really upset though. I was covered in gross pond stuff for an unfunny prank that only the robotics team enjoyed but the whole school saw. Kids worked hard on the ecosphere project too and they ruined it (even though it was already graded tbf). Also if the jar had hit me or shattered I could\u2019ve been badly hurt.\n\nI reported them to the principal that afternoon. There was picture/video evidence. They got in trouble and are currently facing serious consequences like suspension. Another robotics teammate told me that I shouldn\u2019t have run to the principal because Angela is at risk of losing her scholarships at MIT this fall. Jeff could also risk losing his internship with Boeing. \n\nMost people on the team said I should have pranked them back. I do like pranks and don\u2019t want to damage anyones career. But I also feel right to be upset.
