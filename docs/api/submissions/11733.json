UPDATE!", "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nFirst off, I want to thank everyone that commented on my last post. It blew up so I wanted to update really quickly.\n\nI wanted to answer a few questions:\n\n1. Yes, I have a year's worth of savings. This means that I can pay for rent and other expenses for up to one year without a job.\n2. I do plan on continuing to look for a new position and take interviews when I can. I hope that I can get a new one because in my state I am unable to get a new apartment without proof of income at my age.\n3. I only moved back in with my parents temporarily. It\u2019s been a month; I wanted to save money and not have an apartment. They are also storing all of my stuff. They are normally okay parents but they play favorites.\n4. I will not go no contact with my family, but maybe low contact. They are important to me. But I will take your advice to stop babysitting every Sunday for my niece. It's obviously been a bad habit for my sister and BIL.\n\nOn to the update. Today was my niece's birthday. It was a small get-together of my family and some friends and it was a really good time. After the party, my sister pulled me aside. She apologized for getting my mom up in arms about the babysitting. She knew I wanted to go on the trip. We hugged and I accepted her apology.\n\nFor your information, my mom and I don't really get along. I don't like how she treats people and her favoritism has always caused some insecurity. Though she has helped me a lot and I am grateful to her, I will always be the \"bratty,\" youngest daughter and I've come to accept that. Unfortunately, because of her, I have this people-pleasing behavior that I am trying to break out of. Hence the pure turmoil between choosing my trip over my niece. My mom is very controlling. The only reason I am still in contact is because of my dad. He\u2019s my best friend. I would hate to leave him behind. He understands my problems with my mom. He hasn\u2019t tried to fix much, he doesn\u2019t know how, but he listens and takes my feelings into account. It means the world to me. \n\nWhen my mom heard my sister complain she decided it was going to be a good way to keep me home. She told the family about how a \"little girl\" shouldn't be traveling alone. She's mentioned the Natalie Holloway case and that set a lot of people off. She watches a lot of Lifetime and Dateline. It's why everyone started hounding me in the first place. Then she added on my lack of a job and my other responsibilities (babysitting) so that everyone would agree that I shouldn\u2019t go.\n\nNow the big update is that I did choose my trip, in fact, I'm planning to extend, maybe I\u2019ll travel more around SE Asia or go to Australia since I will be over there. TBD. But I wanted to thank everyone for the advice and the good wishes. You all have made me feel so much more confident about this trip.

You are 27, and that may make you a little girl if you're a tortoise or a Greenland shark, but as a human it makes you a perfectly normal adult. \n\nHave a great trip, and grey rock the eff out of your mom.", "Congrats, bon voyage, and your sister is awesome for apologizing.", "I just read your original post and want to give my 2 cents and some encouragement.  \n\nI left for a year-long sabbatical when my nieces were 1.5 and 4 years old to travel around SEA by myself. This was a few years ago, and I didn't even have a smartphone or anything and kept in contact with my family via Skype in Internet caf\u00e9s. I talked to my nieces often, and they still knew who i was and were excited when I finally came back after nearly 4 years (I extended a bit lol). \n\nAnd it's so much easier now to stay in touch with face time, WhatsApp, and all that. \n\nMy family was also very worried about me travelling alone as a woman. But honestly, if you use a bot of common sense, you are as safe or unsafe as you are at home as well. Of course, there are cases every now and then of bad things happening to travellers,  but bad things happen at home, too. \n\nIf you are alone, manage your travel times that you arrive in daylight in a new place. Lock your luggage if its not in your hands. Keep your important documents and valuables on your body (don't leave them in the bus when they stop for lunch or something). Make copies of your passport and other important documents and load them into a cloud so you can access them even if you lose everything else. Keep paper copies of your passport on you and offer them instead of the original for places like hostels to keep. If possible, don't give your passport to anyone unless you are there. Instead of staying in nice hotels or Airbnb's, consider hostels and other places frequented by travelers, and you'll always find people to hang out with or join for a trip. \n\nEspecially in SEA, you never *have* to travel alone unless you want to. There are so many people around, groups, and solo travellers. \n\nAnd as for your job hunt, I once did a Skype interview from a remote beach in Karnataka, India, and got the job. There is really no reason these days why you have to be home for that. \n\nGood luck, and enjoy your freedom.", "I am happy for you! Have a great trip!", "Good for you! Enjoy", "Original:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ewk7u/aita_for_choosing_a_trip_over_babysitting_my_niece/", "Thank you!", "I saw it! Thanks so much for the advice. It makes me feel better seeing other women that also have traveled and felt okay about it", "Excellent advice!  I hope OP sees it.", "If you have a backpack on the ground put your leg through the arms strap. Get used to putting on sunblock at breakfast and lunch. Drink more water then you think. Take a business card of where you are staying so you can give it to a tuk tuk driver even when you can\u2019t communicate. Don\u2019t wear necklaces. Have an absolute ball!!", "Look, if you are traveling alone you do need to be careful and watch out for yourself. But comparing your situation to Natalie Holloway is unfair. She was my age, our birthdays are not even 2 weeks apart. If I recall correctly Natalie was partying every day and snuck out after curfew to meet some guys. I am not victim blaming at all, but she made some choices that made her an easy target, and people with bad intentions, whoever they are, took full advantage. \n\nSo make good decisions and enjoy your trip!", "Definitely do SE Asia and Aus while you\u2019re over there. I\u2019d recommend spending significantly more time in SE Asia than Aus, just money wise and experiences. Have a great trip!", "Happy holidays \ud83d\udc95", "Have a wonderful trip!!", "So glad you have stuck to your guns!\n\nAnd if you do make it to Australia, specifically Sydney HMU and I\u2019ll show you round!", "Good for you. But as a mom, I do kind of feel your moms fear. I mean as a single woman I would totally do it! But as a mom I\u2019m like \u201cmm, I\u2019d rather you not\u201d. My 20 year old son wanted to travel alone and I had a massive panic attack while trying to say \u201coh that sounds like a lot of fun!\u201d. \n\nParenting is complex. Have fun on your trip. And don\u2019t hitchhike. I have met a few solo female travellers where I am from and it\u2019s refreshing to see girls follow their dreams, but one was murdered and it kills me to think of her.", "It\u2019s disappointing about the dad. Mom has apparently been pulling stuff like this for years and he just throws his arms in the air. Defend your daughter man\u2026", "Ok, sister friend, go explore the world. Get some new experiences, have fun, get into trouble, navigate a travel disaster, fall a little bit in love, have some weird sex, and come home with a tattoo you didn't need.\n\nBut when all this is done, please get some therapy and unpack this:\n\n>The only reason I am still in contact is because of my dad.

He hasn\u2019t tried to fix much, he doesn\u2019t know how, but he listens and takes my feelings into account.\n\nYour father is supposed to be your protector. He's supposed to make sure no one makes you feel bad, controls you or treats you poorly.\n\nHe's failed completely in this regard. He puts his comfort- not needing to deal with your mom- over your mental health.\n\nThat's not ok.", "Yay! Safe travels, enjoy your time. Visit jeju island off South Korea if you plan to extend your time in Korea. Enjoy!!", "I am also a solo female Traveller. It is so much easier to stay in contact now with friends and family while travelling. What's App and Marco Polo are amazing. \n\nJust a few things, maybe look into a travelling lock. One that you can put on doors to help secure it more? I have one maybe Google hotel door locks f9r Travellers. You could also get the GHB drink strips that help you make sure your drinks are safe from some of the drugs people can use in drinks. \n\nSome things I always keep in mind. Don't walk with ear buds in, in areas you are unfamiliar with. \nKeep cash in separate spots in your bags. \nTry and keep important papers or passport on your person as much as you can. \nBe aware of your surroundings.\nTrust your gut.\nMost of all, have fun and enjoy your travels.", "You should find a job abroad!", "Enjoy your trip! Take short videos. Look into streaming platforms and earning some money while you\u2019re traveling. Maybe TikTok, YouTube shorts, or Twitch? Those of us who can\u2019t travel would love to watch your journey. Please look into it. People say a lot of things about TT but I\u2019ve seen some everyday people step in and help someone when needed or to step in and show them the local favorites. Start watching other travel videos, create channels and start getting some followers.", "That\u2019s all just the general advice , to know your surroundings and make sure you\u2019re in a safe area if alone but it\u2019s no reason to be paranoid. Her mom was dumb for comparing her to Natalie , they\u2019re not even in the same age group", "I'm (45F) and going to NYC in April by myself for 6 days and my mom is nervous!  I went by myself when I was 31 too and it was the best trip ever.  She knows I can handle it and am street smart but she can't help it.  It's just a mom's job to always be nervous no matter how old their kid is.  :)", "Don't wear necklaces? Just for the fear of them being stolen or....??", "When I was there people would go between tables and massage tourists necks and heads for tips. The majority of them were legitimate and so lovely but some pick pockets took up imitating them as a grift. They would massage you, take the jewellery and disappear before you would even notice they were gone. It\u2019s a small number that are the bad apples but it\u2019s not a good idea to wear things that you would be sad about losing.", "This is all good news.  Have a great time, OP!", "Oh lord, sounds like my mother. Don't get taken in by the bullshit. Do what you want, when you want, for as long as you want.  You won't win with these people, so go ahead and you know what? They'll be the same when you get back Maybe with attitude, but you can deal with it when it happens.", "NTA live your life darling.. live it for all of us who can't travel. See the world \ud83c\udf0e", "My brother-in-law moved to South Korea right before my husband and I got married. He met our son when he was about a year and a half old when he visited for a few days. He came back again 2 years later and my son still knew who he was because we've mentioned him and there are pictures of him. Then he started coming back once a year for a family trip and even when he got married they came home for the wedding. Both my children know who HE is, know who the wife is, and will hug and welcome them when they see them. They've probably seen the wife twice ever, and the brother-in-law about five times. But they still know their uncle and he'll occasionally send presents for Christmas or birthdays.", "I'm so glad for you!\n\nFor your plans - Australia would be an awesome place to visit! I live in Melbourne and it's so easy to get around. Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne would make an amazing trip on their own - just be aware it's a bit more expensive over here, and plan ahead when you go. There's also a pretty big travel community here so you can probably find buddies even when you're here.", "I laughed at the tortoise or Greenland shark line", "Great point!", "As your destination is Europe and one trip to South Korea, you should be fine if you use some common sense.", "It\u2019s a good thing none of my jewelry is worth anything", "Then you are ready to go!", "If you're considering Australia, I'd consider New Zealand too. Beautiful country with unique wildlife and I've heard nothing but good things in general about it.", "I\u2019m so glad you went and that you are enjoying yourself. Their reasons for stopping you are dumb. A weekly day from child rearing is more than what most people get. Your sister was out of line especially since your parents or others could help. Happy she apologized and realized how ridiculous she was being.", "Who wants to bet the OP's mother got married or started having kids by the time she was 27 if not before?", "\"Ok, sister friend, go explore the world. Get some new experiences, have fun, get into trouble, navigate a travel disaster, fall a little bit in love, have some weird sex, and come home with a tattoo you didn't need.\"\n\nCouldn't have said this better!!!! Go find you!!!!!", "I have actually. A friend of mine is in queenstown. I\u2019m more worried about the cold then the place.", "It's disappointing when kids can't understand that the other parent's (parent B) \"sins\" are just as bad as the abusive ones (parent A), if the other (parent B) won't defend and protect the child. Sad.", "OP where I live (UK) taking a gap year to travel or volunteer abroad is super common. All my friends did it. Some travelled particularly to South America and Asia, some stayed in one or two countries for a year, some volunteered in far away countries. The point is, lots of people do it, most commonly when they are 18 after school or 21/22 after university. At 27 you already are a bit less green behind the ears and perfectly capable of taking care of yourself. Just enjoy yourself, make lots of friends along the way, and make some amazing memories. Have a fabulous time OP!!", "Thank you for the update!!! I remember your other post! So glad you chose the trip and your sister apologized. If you can ABSOLUTELY Go to Australia!!!!! It\u2019s amazing!! I spent 3 months driving the East Coast and it was the highlight of my life! Cairns is beautiful and has one of the oldest rainforests in the world! Sydney is wonderful! There is soo much to see!", "I can relate in some ways because when you are in a toxic atmosphere, the rare 'goodness' - even if it's as bad as the abusive parent - is something you'd covet and it's not something you give up easily. \n\nOP, I managed to go to Thailand once and that's where I fell in love with their green curry \\*randomly derails\\*", "I have traveled all over the world by myself for almost a decade (36f), including remote solo camping and hiking. I\u2019ve never had a SINGLE incident where another human made me feel unsafe. In fact, I\u2019ve lived in NYC for almost all of that time and I\u2019ve never felt in danger while by myself. I might just be lucky, but the one thing i always do is LOOK EVERY PERSON IN THE EYE. I am tall but slight, so I\u2019m not particularly intimidating, but i am usually annoyed with at least one thing that can give me \u201cresting bitch face\u201d.\n\nHowever, this is really only when you walking alone at night and need to sacrifice pleasantries for safety. During the day it\u2019s best to TALK TO LOCALS YOU TRUST to learn where to go, who else is cool, how to get places, etc. Almost every person I\u2019ve met while traveling alone was supportive and useful, and these connections can help you truly enjoy the local community rather than fall into tourist traps.\n\nIt\u2019s really all about confidence and connection, and realizing that most humans are awesome and you do not have to be at the mercy of the ones who raised you. So happy for you!", "All good suggestions. I would also carry a small amount of \u201cstealing money\u201d in a small purse in case anyone tried to rob me. Meanwhile most of my cash was rolled up inside small fabric pockets I\u2019d sewn into the seams of my trouser legs/skirts. Same with bank cards - one in the purse and the rest hidden away. \n\nTravelling solo is great as you get to choose what you want to see without having to accommodate others - and you make friends with fellow travellers who share your interests.", "Not sure where home is, but NZ cold is a different cold. lol  I grew up in Chicago, and thought I could hack SUMMER in NZ. Nope.  Went to Christchurch, and I was so cold. lol I mean, I only needed a jacket but I was leaving 110 in Australia.  I had to buy the jacket before I even left the airport ! ;) \n\nAlso maybe don't tell you fam this, but I travelled at 29 to Australia/NZ for \"three months\" and went back over a year later, pregnant, to get married.  I've never been back since. Now an Aussie citizen. BEST TRIP EVER. ;)", "Not me always fiddling with my jewelry, I would be playing with it too much for them to do that"]}
