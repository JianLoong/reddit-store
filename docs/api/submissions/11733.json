UPDATE!", "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nFirst off, I want to thank everyone that commented on my last post. It blew up so I wanted to update really quickly.\n\nI wanted to answer a few questions:\n\n1. Yes, I have a year's worth of savings. This means that I can pay for rent and other expenses for up to one year without a job.\n2. I do plan on continuing to look for a new position and take interviews when I can. I hope that I can get a new one because in my state I am unable to get a new apartment without proof of income at my age.\n3. I only moved back in with my parents temporarily. It\u2019s been a month; I wanted to save money and not have an apartment. They are also storing all of my stuff. They are normally okay parents but they play favorites.\n4. I will not go no contact with my family, but maybe low contact. They are important to me. But I will take your advice to stop babysitting every Sunday for my niece. It's obviously been a bad habit for my sister and BIL.\n\nOn to the update. Today was my niece's birthday. It was a small get-together of my family and some friends and it was a really good time. After the party, my sister pulled me aside. She apologized for getting my mom up in arms about the babysitting. She knew I wanted to go on the trip. We hugged and I accepted her apology.\n\nFor your information, my mom and I don't really get along. I don't like how she treats people and her favoritism has always caused some insecurity. Though she has helped me a lot and I am grateful to her, I will always be the \"bratty,\" youngest daughter and I've come to accept that. Unfortunately, because of her, I have this people-pleasing behavior that I am trying to break out of. Hence the pure turmoil between choosing my trip over my niece. My mom is very controlling. The only reason I am still in contact is because of my dad. He\u2019s my best friend. I would hate to leave him behind. He understands my problems with my mom. He hasn\u2019t tried to fix much, he doesn\u2019t know how, but he listens and takes my feelings into account. It means the world to me. \n\nWhen my mom heard my sister complain she decided it was going to be a good way to keep me home. She told the family about how a \"little girl\" shouldn't be traveling alone. She's mentioned the Natalie Holloway case and that set a lot of people off. She watches a lot of Lifetime and Dateline. It's why everyone started hounding me in the first place. Then she added on my lack of a job and my other responsibilities (babysitting) so that everyone would agree that I shouldn\u2019t go.\n\nNow the big update is that I did choose my trip, in fact, I'm planning to extend, maybe I\u2019ll travel more around SE Asia or go to Australia since I will be over there. TBD. But I wanted to thank everyone for the advice and the good wishes. You all have made me feel so much more confident about this trip.

You are 27, and that may make you a little girl if you're a tortoise or a Greenland shark, but as a human it makes you a perfectly normal adult. \n\nHave a great trip, and grey rock the eff out of your mom.", "Congrats, bon voyage, and your sister is awesome for apologizing.", "I just read your original post and want to give my 2 cents and some encouragement.  \n\nI left for a year-long sabbatical when my nieces were 1.5 and 4 years old to travel around SEA by myself. This was a few years ago, and I didn't even have a smartphone or anything and kept in contact with my family via Skype in Internet caf\u00e9s. I talked to my nieces often, and they still knew who i was and were excited when I finally came back after nearly 4 years (I extended a bit lol). \n\nAnd it's so much easier now to stay in touch with face time, WhatsApp, and all that. \n\nMy family was also very worried about me travelling alone as a woman. But honestly, if you use a bot of common sense, you are as safe or unsafe as you are at home as well. Of course, there are cases every now and then of bad things happening to travellers,  but bad things happen at home, too. \n\nIf you are alone, manage your travel times that you arrive in daylight in a new place. Lock your luggage if its not in your hands. Keep your important documents and valuables on your body (don't leave them in the bus when they stop for lunch or something). Make copies of your passport and other important documents and load them into a cloud so you can access them even if you lose everything else. Keep paper copies of your passport on you and offer them instead of the original for places like hostels to keep. If possible, don't give your passport to anyone unless you are there. Instead of staying in nice hotels or Airbnb's, consider hostels and other places frequented by travelers, and you'll always find people to hang out with or join for a trip. \n\nEspecially in SEA, you never *have* to travel alone unless you want to. There are so many people around, groups, and solo travellers. \n\nAnd as for your job hunt, I once did a Skype interview from a remote beach in Karnataka, India, and got the job. There is really no reason these days why you have to be home for that. \n\nGood luck, and enjoy your freedom.", "I am happy for you! Have a great trip!", "Good for you! Enjoy", "Original:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ewk7u/aita_for_choosing_a_trip_over_babysitting_my_niece/", "Thank you!", "I saw it! Thanks so much for the advice. It makes me feel better seeing other women that also have traveled and felt okay about it", "Excellent advice!  I hope OP sees it.", "If you have a backpack on the ground put your leg through the arms strap. Get used to putting on sunblock at breakfast and lunch. Drink more water then you think. Take a business card of where you are staying so you can give it to a tuk tuk driver even when you can\u2019t communicate. Don\u2019t wear necklaces. Have an absolute ball!!"]}
