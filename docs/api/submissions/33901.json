Me and my wife \"Lina\" (35f) live in the house she has inherited. The house is rather large and has a lot of space but due to its age is not very soundproof. To give an example Lina can hear me in the downstairs kitchen while working in the office on the second floor in a different part of the house.\n\nBefore I get to the issue it is important to note that Lina is also suffering from very bad migraines usually triggered by loud sounds that affect her vision and make it blurry so she has to lie down in peace and quiet for an hour or so to let it pass before she carries on working. Unfortunately she also pulled a short straw this year and had to work through Christmas (usually it means be on call due to specific line of her job). As she deals with high profile clients she can't be disturbed when on call and prefers the house being quiet (noise cancelling headphones don't help). Lina is also working from home and the closest office is 6 hours away.\n\nTo the issue: at the start of last week my sister's house had a malfunction, making it temporarily inhabitable. Due to Christmas and all the holidays it is not going to be fixed until the start of the new year so she and her partner asked if it will be okay to live with us as we have more space compared to our parents. I have consulted Lina and told Kate they can stay provided she keeps the kids quiet and explained the nature of Lina's migraines and her line of work. The rules were simple such as kids either wearing headphones when watching TV or have it on lower volumes and Kate making sure Dylan is not upset and crying all the time. Kate and her partner thanked us and promised to keep the kids in check.\n\n2 days go by, I'm out and about to help my parents until I get a distressed call from Lina saying the kids are very loud, she spoke to Kate but she can't bring them under control. I can hear the kids clearly on the background, so I call Kate and remind her of our agreement and she promises to fix it. However the next day the kids are even worse then before, shouting while playing fortnight and Dylan is constantly upset and crying, which is affecting my wife and her work. She even got a few complaints in as her clients couldn't hear her (we do plan renovating the house and making her office soundproof, just saving money for it).\n\nDue to this I have asked Kate and her partner to leave and probably move in with my parents as they were unable to follow simple rules. My tried to argue and beg for me to change my decision, but ultimately the house is Lina's and these were her rules to follow. As it happened the day before Christmas my sister called me an asshole and said I have ruined Christmas for my niece and nephews before packing and moving to our parents.

You simply can\u2019t accommodate them when you need complete quiet for work and health reasons. \n\nYou\u2019ve tried to do a kind thing but your expectations for your guests were unreasonable.

I suffer from migraines and would not cope with a trigger constantly happening around me. I have noticed that people who don't suffer from migraines can be dismissive of the severity because they don't understand the difference between a migraine and a regular headache. This often results in people thinking we're being overly sensitive about avoiding them. I'm a little envious of your partner's migraines because they have such a short duration - mine last for up to 3 days, with another 1-2 days to fully recover. Not that a shorter timeframe is any less painful.", "NAH.   \nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to keep kids that age quiet for hours and hours each day, especially if they are stuck in a house and not going out.

The parents should have actively trying to take the kids out to burn off their energy like to parks and stuff, or to find out when working hours are for your wife and take the kids out for a few hours to give her some quiet to work.  It\u2019s not that hard, she could have even taken the kids over to the grandparents for a few hours.  \n\nGosh when I was the only family member with kids, when we were staying with family they would always get up at the crack of dawn so I\u2019d snuggle the kids out of the house and walk to the park or drive somewhere to run some energy out of them\u2026 and arrive back at the home at a more reasonable wake up time.  It\u2019s not that hard to be a decent human.\n\nNo your sister disrespected and ignored your rules and never intended on being quiet.", "Nta.

Not a preference. It's  not a bad thing if she and the kids aren't compatible in close quarters for days on end; it just is. You can't tell a migraine to please be more understanding!", "NTA.

But still you would be in the right - your home, your rules.", "Your kind of the asshole for expecting kids to make no noise that was never going to happen, you should have just refused initially if your wife was working from home but you didn't and now everyone thinks you're unreasonable but ultimately your sister is the one at fault she knew herself the kids wouldn't be quiet but still told you they would so that's on her.", "NTA your parents are just mad that now they have to deal with all the noise.

We learned *young* to play quietly, to read, or to go outside and play when mom was laying down with a headache. Dad was really consistent about enforcing that expectation.

No tv at all on Sundays. On Saturday, we were allowed to watch cartoons and Disney movies in the morning, but had to keep the volume low enough not to disturb our parents and turn them off as soon as our parents woke up (huge incentive for keeping the volume low).\n\nAs kids, we just learned how to have fun and do our chores with quiet voices and bodies. \n\nIt is possible to teach kids to be aware of their volume level and how to self manage it; it's just not a popular or in-vogue parenting thing to do.", "I remember my first migraine\n\nI thought I was dying\n\nBegged ny mom to take me to the hospital", "They usually last longer it just takes a couple of hours to get her vision back under control, but the migraine itself can last for days and make her physically sick too", "I get migraines and always have a headache.

I understand why they\u2019re there but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to host most people for days with those expectations. I would refuse to consider it in the future.\n\nSounds like your sister was desperate and didn\u2019t think it through, maybe she didn\u2019t quite get the severity of the migraines, maybe she didn\u2019t get how quiet the kids have to be. Maybe she\u2019s used to the sound of her own kids and they were being quiet for them. \n\nWhile 7 and 11 year olds can be expected to control their volume, to expect them to do it for days on end, even wearing headphones for tv? That\u2019s a lot to expect of kids who are used to being able to play at their normal volume. Especially depending on where they are- it\u2019s normally a lot colder here, and it\u2019s wet and muddy instead and expecting my kids to play outside in that is ludicrous and anywhere else I can think of to get my kids out of the house would lead to different problems especially if money is tight. And for me, I\u2019m an introvert and I would not want to bring them anywhere days in a row to get them out of the house.\n\nBut what gets me is not wanting the 18month old to cry. My kids are 3 and 4 and they still cry when they get told no or to share. It can take ten minutes or more for them to calm down. I\u2019m not giving into them because that\u2019s bad parenting but that does mean crying happens and for lengths of time. An 18 month old is barely speaking, not expected to put two words together until they\u2019re over the age of two, they can\u2019t always communicate what\u2019s wrong when they\u2019re crying, and trying to figure out what they need if you didn\u2019t see them fall or don\u2019t recognize movements (such as tugging on a diaper for a diaper change) can be a guessing game that takes several minutes.They might be hungry, they might be sick, they might just be overtired. When my younger was overtired at 18months, the only solution was cuddling, often until she fell asleep, which could take half an hour or more. Telling me to get my kids to stop crying doesn\u2019t help; either I make the poor parenting move of giving in, or wait it out particularly when they\u2019re just tired and there\u2019s nothing actually wrong. Best I can do is take them to another room.\n\nDealing with all that with migraines is a pain and I have suffered a lot since becoming a parent. I imagine it\u2019s worse when they\u2019re not your kids. \n\nNext time just save everyone the pain and refuse.", "Yta. And I\u2019m suprised so many are saying nta.

I\u2019d also say asking a 7 and 11 year old to be so quiet that they have to use headphones when watching TV is a lot too. I would\u2019ve considered myself a well behaved kid and even now, I think I\u2019d be too loud to stay at your house. \n\nI get your sister agreed to your rules and she\u2019s a bit of an AH for doing that, but her house had just become uninhabitable and she was desperate, so I\u2019m giving her a little bit of slack. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m going to go with NAH.", "So she allowed them to play fortnight and expected a kid to be quiet? That\u2019s on the mom because she shouldn\u2019t have allowed them to play.", "I bet OP's parents were the type to tell OP to stay in a corner and make no noise! Usually their rules change when it comes to grandchildren", "I started taking nurtec and it's been amazing! I know different things work for different people, but if you have insurance it might be worth a shot.\n\nAlso you're totally right about people dismissing migraines until they have one. My grandfather always took over everything when my grandmother had one, but he privately thought she was milking it too get a break. Then he got one (only one and it was a reaction to something or other) and has been way more sympathetic since! My partner also didn't understand everything I did with migraines until he started getting them. He's lucky, it's maybe once or twice a year for about a day, but he totally understands now! (He would get a little frustrated that he had to be totally silent and the room was almost pitch black. Just to the point he'd complain a little about not being able to game with his brother, and might trip if he came in the bedroom. Now he understands)", ">they would always get up at the crack of dawn so I\u2019d snuggle the kids out of the house\n\nI'm pretty sure this was a typo, but I'm loving the image of a mom cuddling her kids as she carries them out of the house lol", "Yes, he made the mistake of trying to please too many people, and failed his wife. He shouldn't have asked that of her.", "Loud by design lol!", "<<unkeepable rule>>\n\nIf it was an unkeepable rule then it was on sister and partner to find other accommodations(They had options, hotel, short term housing or parents' house) and say so rather than literally mess with Lina's health and job.", "Why does Lina have to leave HER house?  They knew the deal before they came.", "<<There is no reason that the older kids NEED to be playing Fortnite and yelling while Lina is working.>>\n\nI don't play the game so I did google--its recommended for 13 and up(violence and access to open chat), so an 11 yr old and 7 yr old shouldn't really be playing it anyway and parents should have left it at home rather than letting them playing a raucous game at their hosts home unrestricted.  (this is agreement not attacking your comment)", "Why? She could have left with the kids during working hours and gone with them in the park or so. Or she could just not have agreed to the conditions and gone directly to the parents. I understand you can't really keep a baby from crying but I also wouldn't go to a house where the no 1 rule was \"be quiet, because it triggers the owners migraines and disrupts her work\".", "Lots of people simply have no tolerance for kids who dont listen and are loud. You can be understanding and still not allow it in your home.", "You cannot simply \"keep children quiet\" the way you would an adult\n\nI'm pretty sure I've read enough Reddits that Adults aren't quiet while playing Fortnite LOL but the parent can 1)not let them play a violent video game but quieter games.  Card games, art projects(no glitter).  Even board games(Not Trouble--that dice popper can be noisy LOL)", "For 8 hours a day? And what happens after the workday when they come back and Lina gets a migraine? I say NAH, because the adults were all willing to try to make it work but it was never going to work.", "True. \n\nBut as the older kids go, it's still more on the parents not even trying", "I describe as being repeatedly stabbed through the eye into the brain with a jackhammer. While being nauseous and partially or fully blind.", "I was in sixth grade gym class. On basketball day. \n\nThe coach wouldn\u2019t let me go to the nurse at first until my friends had to half carry me back to her office to ask. Even then she wouldn\u2019t let any of them help me to the nurses office. Honestly not sure how I made it there. I threw up as soon as I got to the nurses office so they called my mom. \n\nWhen she got there I ran out to her in the hallway crying it hurt so bad.", "He is an asshole to his wife for allowing his sister's family to disturb her. Migraines are no joke. He needed to tell his sister sorry, but no.", "Lol", "OP you are NTA, but it was not going to be possible to keep 3 kids occupied. Kids get more agitated when they can see that people are trying to push them into silence. I'm sure your sister tried her best but with an 18 month old, it isn't always easy to keep others in check. I hope your family can get over this.", "My 7YO is a sweet kid, she\u2019s currently learning to play chess with her dad - a fairly quiet activity, right?\n\nThe kid has two settings on her volume dial - extremely loud and asleep. She\u2019s loud even just saying, \u201cso can my queen move here?\u201d", "It wouldn't be unreasonable at all to expect the kids to be quiet if the kids' parents were taking them out each day to somewhere where they could run around, yell, act wild, expend energy, have fun, etc.\n\nWhich is the obvious thing for this situation. Plugging them into a tv or computer game for the holidays isn't even especially good for kids.", "<<taken the kids out during the day. Took them to the movies. Went to the parents house>>\n\nthank you, very much this.", "You don\u2019t know what the weather was like where they live- it was rainy and therefore muddy on the 23rd and Christmas Eve here. The park would not have been an option. \n\nI feel like everyone should\u2019ve known this would never work though.", "I said to save everyone the pain and refuse next time. I think he was well within his rights to kick them out. There\u2019s good reasons not to have loud kids in his house, I never denied that. I\u2019m just more wondering how in the world he thought it was possible to keep the kids quiet the whole time.\n\nKids being loud doesn\u2019t have much to do with them not listening- plenty of times when my kids are playing with their cousins, we remind them all to be quieter, they\u2019re quieter for anywhere from five to thirty minutes then hype each other up and get loud again. They\u2019re listening but they\u2019re having fun and being excited and need reminders sometimes. That\u2019s normal.", "Sometimes you don't have any choice. My migraines through my last pregnancy were awful but I still needed money and to take care of my other 2 kids.", "Maybe you should make an effort teaching her to use her indoor voice then? A kid that age occasionally forgetting to is one thing - not being able to dial down *at all* unless asleep is entirely another - assuming they are not on the spectrum.", "Some kids really CAN be quiet - a family friend has a kiddo (8? 9?) that will just sit quietly and ready for hours as long as she's got a good book. If she wants a drink, she gets up and does it herself. She's a gem. OP probably didn't know what they were like because they weren't his kids, so that's why he deferred to his sister. She's the one that had BOTH the knowledge of what was required and whether her kids would be able to meet those requirements. If she didn't think they could do it, she should have passed.", "It\u2019s been rainy, chilly and muddy where I live. Expecting kids to be outside for 8+ hours in that type of weather is a big ask. The parents could\u2019ve taken the kids somewhere else, but depending on what needs to be fixed at the house, they might be short on money.", "Do we know that they didn\u2019t even think of going outside? As far as I can tell, all we *know* is that they were there for at least a portion of the work day.", "She had somewhere else to go. She just didn't want to stay with her parents because OP had more room. OP was gracious to allow them to stay as long as they could abide by one rule. Being so loud that OP's wife is getting complaints at work is shitty behavior since it could jeopardize her job. If the sister knew she couldn't keep her kids quiet, she should have just gone to the parents and not lied saying she could.", "I have and she\u2019s great at that at school, also I didn\u2019t ask for advice kthxbai", "I was that kid. I did not sit quietly and read for a full day. I was very loud when walking and I had trouble keeping to an indoor voice when I did speak. I did need ways to get out my energy at some point. \n\nAnd that covers the 11 year old, not so much the 7 year old\u2026 and what are you expecting an 18 month old to do, who is transitioning from baby to toddler? Keeping them quiet when they\u2019re upset is mission impossible, especially when not giving into bad parenting. \n\nAlso, I leave the house fully confident my kids will not be too loud/crazy for whatever thing we\u2019re doing that day, only to realize too late that my kids are louder/harder to keep under control than I expected. I\u2019m getting better at some of my expectations but how loud they are still takes me by surprise. I always see them as on the quieter side at home, but really I\u2019m just used to the noise and it only bothers me when I have a migraine.", "She thought she could comply and kids being chaos agents laughed at her", "Can she or can\u2019t she? Because if she *can* do it at school then she *can* in other environments, say in the house of someone who is putting you up as a favour, too. Which is exactly what I said a kid that age is able to do lol", "what is the point you were trying to make then? As obviously 7 year olds are capable of appropriate volume control", "Tell me you\u2019re not a parent without telling me you\u2019re not a parent. \n\nDo you behave the exact same at home, work, and online, or do you behave in different ways in different situations? Do you have \u201ccompany manners\u201d and \u201cnice restaurant manners\u201d and \u201cpizza and beer night with my buddies manners\u201d?", "That kids are louder than OP and his wife need, and that while 7YOs are *capable* of being quiet as mice, it\u2019s insane to expect them to be so quiet 24 hours a day; and that parents have a higher tolerance for their kids\u2019 noise, so a parent might say their kid is quiet and then a childless person with migraines says \u201cnope, your kid is LOUD.\u201d", "Tell me you\u2019re not willing to teach your child appropriate manners at home without telling me you\u2019re not willing to teach your child appropriate manners at home.

At home, she\u2019s loud af. It would be stupid for me to expect her to have school manners at home when I don\u2019t even expect myself to have work manners at home and I\u2019m a whole ass adult.", "Listen, I don\u2019t care what you do in your home. I wouldn\u2019t do it but if you\u2019re cool with super loud kids then that\u2019s fine. \n\nBUT if your child can be well behaved in different venues then I don\u2019t doubt she could be well behaved in the situation OP describes. Which is my entire point. Your average kid that wasn\u2019t raised by wolves is perfectly capable of being pretty quiet in the situation OP describes."]}
