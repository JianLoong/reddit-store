{"id": 33901, "submission_id": "18sr1da", "title": "AITA for asking my sister to leave over Christmas because her kids were really loud?", "selftext": "I (34m) have an older sister \"Kate\" (36f) who has 3 kids \"Ella\" (11f), \"Mike\" (7m) and \"Dylan\" (18 month). Me and my wife \"Lina\" (35f) live in the house she has inherited. The house is rather large and has a lot of space but due to its age is not very soundproof. To give an example Lina can hear me in the downstairs kitchen while working in the office on the second floor in a different part of the house.\n\nBefore I get to the issue it is important to note that Lina is also suffering from very bad migraines usually triggered by loud sounds that affect her vision and make it blurry so she has to lie down in peace and quiet for an hour or so to let it pass before she carries on working. Unfortunately she also pulled a short straw this year and had to work through Christmas (usually it means be on call due to specific line of her job). As she deals with high profile clients she can't be disturbed when on call and prefers the house being quiet (noise cancelling headphones don't help). Lina is also working from home and the closest office is 6 hours away.\n\nTo the issue: at the start of last week my sister's house had a malfunction, making it temporarily inhabitable. Due to Christmas and all the holidays it is not going to be fixed until the start of the new year so she and her partner asked if it will be okay to live with us as we have more space compared to our parents. I have consulted Lina and told Kate they can stay provided she keeps the kids quiet and explained the nature of Lina's migraines and her line of work. The rules were simple such as kids either wearing headphones when watching TV or have it on lower volumes and Kate making sure Dylan is not upset and crying all the time. Kate and her partner thanked us and promised to keep the kids in check.\n\n2 days go by, I'm out and about to help my parents until I get a distressed call from Lina saying the kids are very loud, she spoke to Kate but she can't bring them under control. I can hear the kids clearly on the background, so I call Kate and remind her of our agreement and she promises to fix it. However the next day the kids are even worse then before, shouting while playing fortnight and Dylan is constantly upset and crying, which is affecting my wife and her work. She even got a few complaints in as her clients couldn't hear her (we do plan renovating the house and making her office soundproof, just saving money for it).\n\nDue to this I have asked Kate and her partner to leave and probably move in with my parents as they were unable to follow simple rules. My tried to argue and beg for me to change my decision, but ultimately the house is Lina's and these were her rules to follow. As it happened the day before Christmas my sister called me an asshole and said I have ruined Christmas for my niece and nephews before packing and moving to our parents. My parents also called me earlier and said I was unreasonable and they are kids so me and Lina should be more understanding.", "created_utc": 1703759981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sr1da/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_leave_over_christmas/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Talk about ruining Christmas - I wouldn't want to spend my holidays listening to obnoxiously loud yelling even without having clients or migraines to worry about.\n\nYour sister agreed to accept responsibility for the kids, then she acts like it's out of her control.

You \"ruined Christmas for your niece & nephews?\" She (potentially) ruined your wife's job... Tough titty sis, get your annoying brats out of the house and do some bloody parenting. Keeping kids quiet at someone else's house means actually being there, with them, playing a quiet game, going out for long walks. playgrounds etc. Can't manage the basics? Get out...", "NTA and Kate, the grandparents, and the kids should be more understanding of Kate\u2019s medical and work conditions. Kids are fully capable of playing quietly, even for days on end. Also, Kate could\u2019ve taken the kids outside or away from the house during the work day. \n\nI cant stand the blanket \u201ckids will be (insert adjective)\u201d excuse. I personally know multiple young kids what are capable of monitoring their noise levels past the age of 3.", "You\u2019re not an AH for asking them to leave but neither yourself or Lina should have agreed to their visit in the first place. You simply can\u2019t accommodate them when you need complete quiet for work and health reasons. \n\nYou\u2019ve tried to do a kind thing but your expectations for your guests were unreasonable. They were probably being as quiet as kids can be. Tbh you\u2019ve messed your sister about by agreeing to their visit then kicking them out. I can understand why she is frustrated.\n\nOverall NAH", "YTA. 3 kids were always going to be loud", "NTA. And kids aged 7 & 11 are old enough to respect the rules. Your sister should have been more respectful and at least take the kids out of the house during the day.", "NTA, but you also set yourself up to be in this position. Three kids over Christmas break were always going to be loud. No matter what Kate did or didn\u2019t do. Toddlers get upset and cry. This was never going to work out given what Lina needed.", "NTA. Also I recommend checking out Crisp, they do a pretty good job at filtering out background noise when I'm on virtual meetings :)", "NTA. I suffer from migraines and would not cope with a trigger constantly happening around me. I have noticed that people who don't suffer from migraines can be dismissive of the severity because they don't understand the difference between a migraine and a regular headache. This often results in people thinking we're being overly sensitive about avoiding them. I'm a little envious of your partner's migraines because they have such a short duration - mine last for up to 3 days, with another 1-2 days to fully recover. Not that a shorter timeframe is any less painful.", "NAH.   \nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to keep kids that age quiet for hours and hours each day, especially if they are stuck in a house and not going out. Kate should have planned to take them out somewhere, and Lina should have said \u201cI have this and this scheduled, I need quiet through the day, but these hours are really important\u201d.   \nCould Lina go work at your parents for the week? It\u2019s nearby right?", "NTA the \u2018cost\u2019 of free accommodation was to manage their kids noise levels.  The 1.5yo, realistically is still a baby and you\u2019d expect some noise, but 7 and 11 yo are old enough to follow these rules.  The parents should have actively trying to take the kids out to burn off their energy like to parks and stuff, or to find out when working hours are for your wife and take the kids out for a few hours to give her some quiet to work.  It\u2019s not that hard, she could have even taken the kids over to the grandparents for a few hours.  \n\nGosh when I was the only family member with kids, when we were staying with family they would always get up at the crack of dawn so I\u2019d snuggle the kids out of the house and walk to the park or drive somewhere to run some energy out of them\u2026 and arrive back at the home at a more reasonable wake up time.  It\u2019s not that hard to be a decent human.\n\nNo your sister disrespected and ignored your rules and never intended on being quiet.", "Nta. Aside from your sister and her partner agreeing to an unkeepable rule, nah really. You tried to help. It didn't work out.", "NTA. Presumably there\u2019s a yard, a park near by? Her *or* the partner could have taken the kids to the outside during the working hours.  \nJust like your rules were quiet times, and your sister couldn\u2019t follow them.  They had a place to go to, it just wasn\u2019t as roomy as they wanted.  Now they know for next time to follow the rules of your house", "NTA. You set these expectations up-front and before they came to stay. If your sister was going to pull the \"this is an unreasonable expectation for kids\" card, she needed to do it at that point, not agree that she could keep them from disrupting your wife's work/exacerbating her medical condition and then break that promise.\n\nYour wife has a *need* for quiet. Not a preference. It's  not a bad thing if she and the kids aren't compatible in close quarters for days on end; it just is. You can't tell a migraine to please be more understanding!", "NTA. You provided your sister conditions to abide by if she was going to stay at your house, and she didn't, which led to problems with your wife's work and impacted on her health. Your sister has no cause for complaint since she didn't uphold her end of the deal.", "NTA\nYour parents are just upset because now the loud kids have to stay with them.", "NTA\n\nShe made a promise, broke it, and now she's upset.  Sounds like she's mad at herself and blaming you.  \n\nYour parents sound pretty clueless, too.  Unless they weren't aware of what the stipulation was to them staying in your home. If they do know, that's worse.", "NTA. Yes they are children and children making noises. But you did your sister a favour. The situation wasn't optimal for anyone. But you told your sister why they need to be quieter. \n\nIf she did her best to controll them - like taking them somewhere (mall, bob sliding, an indoor swimming pool, cinema or stuff like that) to outpower them and to keep them away from your wifes office during her working hours - then kicking her out would be a shit move so close before christmas. But still you would be in the right - your home, your rules.", "Your kind of the asshole for expecting kids to make no noise that was never going to happen, you should have just refused initially if your wife was working from home but you didn't and now everyone thinks you're unreasonable but ultimately your sister is the one at fault she knew herself the kids wouldn't be quiet but still told you they would so that's on her.", "NTA your parents are just mad that now they have to deal with all the noise. Honestly you should have known better to begin with. Kids that young just are not going to be quiet. And expecting a baby to not be fussy is laughable.\n\nWhile you were trying to be gracious to your family and helping the out in a bad spot it just did not go aver very well", "NTA you asked multiple times and she still wouldn\u2019t sort it out. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, your wife is working and needs the quiet.", "NTA. Your sister is for making a promise there was no way to keep. Maybe she could hope the 11 and 7 year olds could be quiet. Maybe. But an 18 month old?  No way. Although to be fair, what the parents of 3 kids and a childfree couple consider noisy are probably vastly different.", "NTA you need to go to your parent\u2019s home and tell them all once again why they had to leave. The noise interrupted your wife\u2019s job. They all are aware of wife\u2019s migraines and the noise caused her to have health issues. You gave it a try and it was not working out. Your wife\u2019s health and job come first. If they still don\u2019t get it I\u2019d lower contact with them all.", "Nta\n\nHomeowners/renters pays for hotels when houses are uninhabitable\n\nYou aren't putting them on the street", "NTA toddler is kinda understandable but older kids should be taught by now how to behave quieter. and should be corrected every time.", "NTA. Kids make noise but you established a boundary. Was it attainable? Realistically, probably not due to the children\u2019s ages. You guys gave it a chance, and it didn\u2019t work out. Your sister is outrageous for calling you an AH. Lina was *working*.", "NTA your mom wants you to be more understanding because she don\u2019t want to deal with them. They are disrupting your parents and they want their quiet house back.", "Nta work trumps their feelings here. If the clients can hear the kids it\u2019s a full stop on them staying there.", "NTA, it was affecting her JOB. That alone is a good enough reason to ask them to leave. Your house, your rules.", "Hey, just wanted to let you know that autocorrect might've messed up your judgement (NTA > NDA) and it might not get counted as a result. \n\nI hate pointing out autocorrect typos because some folks get defensive and think I'm doing it out of a desire to be a Grammar You-Know-What but *I'd* want to know!", "How does that make op an asshole though? He tried to compromise, it didn't work, and a solution was found.", "That's not true. I grew up in a family of 5 kids. My mom had migraines. We learned *young* to play quietly, to read, or to go outside and play when mom was laying down with a headache. Dad was really consistent about enforcing that expectation. It also helped, in retrospect, that we had strict household rules about tv use -- only 2 hours a day (for all the kids, which came out to like 1 half hour show per kid living at home), after family dinner, and only if our school work was done. No tv at all on Sundays. On Saturday, we were allowed to watch cartoons and Disney movies in the morning, but had to keep the volume low enough not to disturb our parents and turn them off as soon as our parents woke up (huge incentive for keeping the volume low).\n\nAs kids, we just learned how to have fun and do our chores with quiet voices and bodies. \n\nIt is possible to teach kids to be aware of their volume level and how to self manage it; it's just not a popular or in-vogue parenting thing to do.", "I remember my first migraine\n\nI thought I was dying\n\nBegged ny mom to take me to the hospital", "They usually last longer it just takes a couple of hours to get her vision back under control, but the migraine itself can last for days and make her physically sick too", "I get migraines and always have a headache. Botox has helped me so much! It reduces my pain by half. NTA btw.", "Why should op have to leave HER home to accommodate the sister! It\u2019s her home! Where she works! It\u2019s unrealistic and down right rude and selfish for anyone to expect her to leave HER home and work somewhere else.\n\nThe sister knew the rules. She didn\u2019t get her kids quite. So now she can live with the parents\n\n\nThe sisters should have taken the kids out during the day. Took them to the movies. Went to the parents house! It\u2019s her job to leave the house if she needed to keep the kids visit so they stay quiet.", "Sorry should have specified, Dylan is 18 months, not 1.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.5 originally meant to be 1.5 years old, male", "> Kids that young are not going to be quiet\n\n11 and 7 year olds are perfectly capable of being quiet. I do agree with you to a degree - because 1.5 months\u2026 there\u2019s just not much you can do there. Babies cry. \n\nBut it sounds like the other 2 were the main problem and that\u2019s honestly just unacceptable. I grew up with 2 parents working shift. I can assure you that children that age don\u2019t have a biological need to scream their heads off.", "This is it exactly.", "So you grew up used to this. These kids haven't and they aren't used to being quiet all the time and are going to forget. It'll take longer than a couple of days to get used to.

I'm impressed she can focus at all through the pain and nausea.", "18 months is 1.5 years?", "Sorry should have clarified, Dylan is 18 months not 1.5 month. 1.5m was meant to say 1.5 years old, male", "The bathroom floor. My old friend. So cool to the touch.", "Lol", "Not your fault tbf I misread that all on my own. 18 months olds are still forces of nature though. While not literal infants\u2026 you can\u2019t exactly reason with them, just try your best to avoid known triggers\u2026 and they add a new trigger every day. You were never going to get perfect compliance there - but like I said\u2026 sounds like the older kids were the main issue anyway?"]}
