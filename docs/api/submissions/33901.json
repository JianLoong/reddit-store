Me and my wife \"Lina\" (35f) live in the house she has inherited. The house is rather large and has a lot of space but due to its age is not very soundproof. To give an example Lina can hear me in the downstairs kitchen while working in the office on the second floor in a different part of the house.\n\nBefore I get to the issue it is important to note that Lina is also suffering from very bad migraines usually triggered by loud sounds that affect her vision and make it blurry so she has to lie down in peace and quiet for an hour or so to let it pass before she carries on working. Unfortunately she also pulled a short straw this year and had to work through Christmas (usually it means be on call due to specific line of her job). As she deals with high profile clients she can't be disturbed when on call and prefers the house being quiet (noise cancelling headphones don't help). Lina is also working from home and the closest office is 6 hours away.\n\nTo the issue: at the start of last week my sister's house had a malfunction, making it temporarily inhabitable. Due to Christmas and all the holidays it is not going to be fixed until the start of the new year so she and her partner asked if it will be okay to live with us as we have more space compared to our parents. I have consulted Lina and told Kate they can stay provided she keeps the kids quiet and explained the nature of Lina's migraines and her line of work. The rules were simple such as kids either wearing headphones when watching TV or have it on lower volumes and Kate making sure Dylan is not upset and crying all the time. Kate and her partner thanked us and promised to keep the kids in check.\n\n2 days go by, I'm out and about to help my parents until I get a distressed call from Lina saying the kids are very loud, she spoke to Kate but she can't bring them under control. I can hear the kids clearly on the background, so I call Kate and remind her of our agreement and she promises to fix it. However the next day the kids are even worse then before, shouting while playing fortnight and Dylan is constantly upset and crying, which is affecting my wife and her work. She even got a few complaints in as her clients couldn't hear her (we do plan renovating the house and making her office soundproof, just saving money for it).\n\nDue to this I have asked Kate and her partner to leave and probably move in with my parents as they were unable to follow simple rules. My tried to argue and beg for me to change my decision, but ultimately the house is Lina's and these were her rules to follow. As it happened the day before Christmas my sister called me an asshole and said I have ruined Christmas for my niece and nephews before packing and moving to our parents.

You simply can\u2019t accommodate them when you need complete quiet for work and health reasons. \n\nYou\u2019ve tried to do a kind thing but your expectations for your guests were unreasonable.

I suffer from migraines and would not cope with a trigger constantly happening around me. I have noticed that people who don't suffer from migraines can be dismissive of the severity because they don't understand the difference between a migraine and a regular headache. This often results in people thinking we're being overly sensitive about avoiding them. I'm a little envious of your partner's migraines because they have such a short duration - mine last for up to 3 days, with another 1-2 days to fully recover. Not that a shorter timeframe is any less painful.", "NAH.   \nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to keep kids that age quiet for hours and hours each day, especially if they are stuck in a house and not going out.

The parents should have actively trying to take the kids out to burn off their energy like to parks and stuff, or to find out when working hours are for your wife and take the kids out for a few hours to give her some quiet to work.  It\u2019s not that hard, she could have even taken the kids over to the grandparents for a few hours.  \n\nGosh when I was the only family member with kids, when we were staying with family they would always get up at the crack of dawn so I\u2019d snuggle the kids out of the house and walk to the park or drive somewhere to run some energy out of them\u2026 and arrive back at the home at a more reasonable wake up time.  It\u2019s not that hard to be a decent human.\n\nNo your sister disrespected and ignored your rules and never intended on being quiet.", "Nta.

Not a preference. It's  not a bad thing if she and the kids aren't compatible in close quarters for days on end; it just is. You can't tell a migraine to please be more understanding!", "NTA.

But still you would be in the right - your home, your rules.", "Your kind of the asshole for expecting kids to make no noise that was never going to happen, you should have just refused initially if your wife was working from home but you didn't and now everyone thinks you're unreasonable but ultimately your sister is the one at fault she knew herself the kids wouldn't be quiet but still told you they would so that's on her.", "NTA your parents are just mad that now they have to deal with all the noise.

We learned *young* to play quietly, to read, or to go outside and play when mom was laying down with a headache. Dad was really consistent about enforcing that expectation.

No tv at all on Sundays. On Saturday, we were allowed to watch cartoons and Disney movies in the morning, but had to keep the volume low enough not to disturb our parents and turn them off as soon as our parents woke up (huge incentive for keeping the volume low).\n\nAs kids, we just learned how to have fun and do our chores with quiet voices and bodies. \n\nIt is possible to teach kids to be aware of their volume level and how to self manage it; it's just not a popular or in-vogue parenting thing to do.", "I remember my first migraine\n\nI thought I was dying\n\nBegged ny mom to take me to the hospital", "They usually last longer it just takes a couple of hours to get her vision back under control, but the migraine itself can last for days and make her physically sick too", "I get migraines and always have a headache.

I understand why they\u2019re there but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to host most people for days with those expectations. I would refuse to consider it in the future.\n\nSounds like your sister was desperate and didn\u2019t think it through, maybe she didn\u2019t quite get the severity of the migraines, maybe she didn\u2019t get how quiet the kids have to be. Maybe she\u2019s used to the sound of her own kids and they were being quiet for them. \n\nWhile 7 and 11 year olds can be expected to control their volume, to expect them to do it for days on end, even wearing headphones for tv? That\u2019s a lot to expect of kids who are used to being able to play at their normal volume. Especially depending on where they are- it\u2019s normally a lot colder here, and it\u2019s wet and muddy instead and expecting my kids to play outside in that is ludicrous and anywhere else I can think of to get my kids out of the house would lead to different problems especially if money is tight. And for me, I\u2019m an introvert and I would not want to bring them anywhere days in a row to get them out of the house.\n\nBut what gets me is not wanting the 18month old to cry. My kids are 3 and 4 and they still cry when they get told no or to share. It can take ten minutes or more for them to calm down. I\u2019m not giving into them because that\u2019s bad parenting but that does mean crying happens and for lengths of time. An 18 month old is barely speaking, not expected to put two words together until they\u2019re over the age of two, they can\u2019t always communicate what\u2019s wrong when they\u2019re crying, and trying to figure out what they need if you didn\u2019t see them fall or don\u2019t recognize movements (such as tugging on a diaper for a diaper change) can be a guessing game that takes several minutes.They might be hungry, they might be sick, they might just be overtired. When my younger was overtired at 18months, the only solution was cuddling, often until she fell asleep, which could take half an hour or more. Telling me to get my kids to stop crying doesn\u2019t help; either I make the poor parenting move of giving in, or wait it out particularly when they\u2019re just tired and there\u2019s nothing actually wrong. Best I can do is take them to another room.\n\nDealing with all that with migraines is a pain and I have suffered a lot since becoming a parent. I imagine it\u2019s worse when they\u2019re not your kids. \n\nNext time just save everyone the pain and refuse.", "Yta. And I\u2019m suprised so many are saying nta.

Regardless of how well behaved a child can be, they\u2019re LOUD. Regardless of how well they listen, sometimes their tiny brains have a break and it\u2019s like a demon takes over. They should have never agreed to let them stay there if they were expecting things to stay the same or that the adults would be able to stop kids from being kids.
