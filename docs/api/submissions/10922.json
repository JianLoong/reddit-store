She's expecting him to be her personal bank account and supplier of expensive things.", "NTA, the boyfriend is probably starting to think the same thing...", "NTA, but, you know, the truth hurts. I don't blame you for not wanting to support that kind of entitled behaviour, though. Your \"friend\" might not be your friend much longer, but then again, these things have a way of sorting themselves out.", "Okay first off, NTA. She DOES sound like a gold-digger. I'm sorry- She thinks that a lack of spending money on her shows a \"lack of commitment\"? Holy hell... Commitment isn't about money. She's 100% a gold digger. \n\nAlso... I have to know. \"Artificial\" diamonds... Does she mean cubic zirconia, or lab-grown? CUz lab-grown diamonds are cheaper, come without the risk of unethical mining, and are chemically identical to a \"natural\" diamond. \n\nLike I can understand being particular about some stones- I myself am very partial to opal, and the lab-made stuff doesn't hold a candle to the real thing in this case. But I also don't fucking *expect* my wife to drop hundreds or thousands of dollars on jewelry for me? She did that once and it was when we both got our engagement rings. \n\nAlso also, you asked what she's done for him, and she didn't have an answer. IMO? She's using him for what he can give her, likes the shiny new toys, and doesn't actually appreciate any of the things that fully grown, emotionally mature adults actually appreciate in a relationship.", "NTA Instead of being grateful for what her bf gives her, she is finding fault because she wants him to spend MORE money on her as proof of her worth. Sounds a lot like a gold-digger.", "NTA. \n\nDamn. You\u2019re not wrong but she\u2019s probably not going to learn a lesson here", "NTA - She is acting like a gold-digger, you just called her out on it.", "I was ready to blame you, but I gotta say, it sounds like your sister is a gold digger and you just called it like it is. Might not have been the most polite thing to do but she was the one complaining about stupid money crap and putting someone through that ain\u2019t exactly Emily Post. NTA", "NTA - Shallow, Gold digger call it what you will but yep that's what it is. She has the wrong attitude and good for calling her out.", "NTA. My fianc\u00e9 provides a great life for us and spoils the crap out of me which I had to get used to but we go do menial things together too and I enjoy everything we do whether it\u2019s what we intended or not. Idk why she\u2019d complain about the resort not being nice enough. I\u2019d be happy he took the time to take me out \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. \n\nHopefully she sees the forest for the trees and gets the bigger picture", "Nta\n\n\nYou called it how you see it. She places way too much value on material things.", "NTA. While I think people are often WAY too quick to call a woman a gold digger, she needs to evaluate her priorities ASAP before she gets a reputation. Better for you to tell her to her face when you\u2019re in private than have her find out people are saying it behind her back.\n\nMy way of showing affection is buying people things, so I get equating material goods with a good relationship, but I also know a relationship isn\u2019t supposed to come with a price tag, and it\u2019s not only the guy\u2019s job to put effort into keeping the romance alive. She feels entitled to being pampered by him 24/7, and that\u2019s a serious issue, as it sounds like her bf has much more realistic standards than she does about what makes a couple.\n\nAlso, natural diamonds are a scam. That\u2019s not really the issue here, but I doubt she could tell a lab grown stone from a real one without help, so she needs to let it go.", "NTA if it walk like a duck and quacks like a duck...", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nThe truth can be uncomfortable to hear, and people generally have a hard time facing their flaws. \n\nI do question if she\u2019s genuinely a gold digger or if she\u2019s struggling with insecure attachment? \n\nHer complaint seems to be less about how he\u2019s not good enough and more about how what he does is a reflection on how he sees her as \u201cnot good enough\u201d. To me, a gold digger is someone who is using someone else for benefits/means/advantage. So if someone is unable to fulfill their desires, then they get dropped. There\u2019s usually some sort of power imbalance. \n\nHowever your sister is clearly hurt by this which makes me believe that she has anxious attachment. She has desires/expectations and engages in interpretations <- if they are not fulfilled it\u2019s a \u201csign\u201d about how this person doesn\u2019t care about her. It\u2019s usually correlated to negative beliefs about the self and difficulty receiving love -> which is unhealthy both for her and the relationship. \n\nSuggesting she see a therapist to help her work on herself might be more beneficial in the long run.", "NTA if your own brother can\u2019t tell you that, who can?", "NTA. Your sister though is most certainly that amongst being a gold-digging vulture too", "NTA.", "NTA but your sister is 100%", "I see a divorce in her future.\n\nNTA.", "Nta for telling her that at all.  It's very sad that she doesn't think she needs to reciprocate any giving.  \n\nI do wonder if her boyfriend hasn't caught on to her motives?\n\nShe is going to continue to be disappointed and of course, blame others, you might want to distance yourself a bit from her so she doesn't blame you.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a piece of work and your assessment and advice seems pretty spot on.", "NTA, but you definitely did not express it in a way that is going to make her see the light on this. It's not your job to, but if you care about her and you want her to change her behavior, you'll probably have to find a way to tell her about it without telling her off. Given how odious her conduct is, I'm not sure what that'd be.", "NTA.\n\n1. You just pointed out the truth. \n\n2. It is sad that some people just can't handle the truth.\n\n3. Your sister sounds extremely entitled and rude.", "NTA \nMight have helped to not use the term gold digger.  People latch onto specific words or phrases that set them over the edge", "NTA but you didn\u2019t say this is the best way. She is definitely superficial and does not hold herself to the same standards which is not fair, but you could have chosen your words more carefully", "ESH.
