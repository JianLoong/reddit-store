I have to know. \"Artificial\" diamonds... Does she mean cubic zirconia, or lab-grown? CUz lab-grown diamonds are cheaper, come without the risk of unethical mining, and are chemically identical to a \"natural\" diamond. \n\nLike I can understand being particular about some stones- I myself am very partial to opal, and the lab-made stuff doesn't hold a candle to the real thing in this case.

Better for you to tell her to her face when you\u2019re in private than have her find out people are saying it behind her back.\n\nMy way of showing affection is buying people things, so I get equating material goods with a good relationship, but I also know a relationship isn\u2019t supposed to come with a price tag, and it\u2019s not only the guy\u2019s job to put effort into keeping the romance alive. She feels entitled to being pampered by him 24/7, and that\u2019s a serious issue, as it sounds like her bf has much more realistic standards than she does about what makes a couple.\n\nAlso, natural diamonds are a scam.
