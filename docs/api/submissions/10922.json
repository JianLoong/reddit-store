I have to know. \"Artificial\" diamonds... Does she mean cubic zirconia, or lab-grown? CUz lab-grown diamonds are cheaper, come without the risk of unethical mining, and are chemically identical to a \"natural\" diamond. \n\nLike I can understand being particular about some stones- I myself am very partial to opal, and the lab-made stuff doesn't hold a candle to the real thing in this case.
