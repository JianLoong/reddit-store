She was the matriarch of my dad\u2019s side and her death left a great impact. I was the first child in the family born after her death. My mom says she really didn\u2019t want to name me this but my dad strong armed her.\n\nThis name has been difficult for me in a number of ways. My dad refused to let me go by a nickname all throughout my childhood. The other kids still found ways to mock me. Such as calling me \u201cPhil\u201d and telling me I had a boy\u2019s name. Then in my teens, they\u2019d ask me if I wanted to be \u201cfilled\u201d. Now, I know kids can find anything to tease people with but it certainly didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe larger reason it was hard is I felt like I had to live up to a ghost. It doesn\u2019t help I look just like her. I was constantly reminded of the legacy I had to live up to. Any time I made a mistake, I was told I needed to uphold the honor of the name.\n\nKeep in mind, I have always listened to my dad\u2019s stories, learned about the history and I greatly appreciate that I was named after someone so amazing. And I tell my dad this, even though I say I\u2019m not a fan of the name. \n\nIn college, I decided to reinvent myself and began going by Lissa. In time, people began to assume my name was Alyssa and I just went with it. To the point that\u2019s all my friends, colleagues, etc. called me this. My family was aware but would still call me Phyllis which I accepted for the time. My dad made his disappointment clear but I told him all that mattered is he got to to call me it. I also explained why the name was difficult to me several times, both growing up and as an adult and he told me the meaning behind it was greater than bullies and that I should be honored to have such a legacy. \n\nI got married last fall and it was an issue for my dad that the officiant called me Alyssa, that Alyssa was written on all the wedding decorations and invitations. When I went to hyphenate my last name with my husband\u2019s, I also chose to legally change my name to Alyssa. I had my grandmother\u2019s middle name as well my whole life and I kept that as it was never an issue (it\u2019s Marie for those curious).\n\nThe issue for my dad is that his family has grown used to calling me Alyssa. I never asked them to, but they chose to do so. My dad has said that I was wrong to change my name and that I should feel honored. I tried to explain my reasoning and he said it hurt him that I didn\u2019t care enough.\n\nI got mad and said I cared enough to respect him calling me Phyllis and never correcting him. I respected him by always validating his feelings and never telling him he was wrong, while he always brushed mine off. But if he wanted the truth, I wasn\u2019t born to be a reincarnation of his mother. I am my own person and it\u2019s not fair for him to put his grief on me. This really upset him. My mom said I pushed it too far by saying all of that. I feel bad he\u2019s upset but I don\u2019t know if I agree I was wrong.

All that needed to be said. Probably needed to be said a long time ago. By your mom, by a therapist, by literally anyone a long time ago.

Your grandmother was never perfect, so how could you be expected to be some ideal and unrealistic form of a person?", "NTA\n\nIt's your name and your life, you can decide what you want to be addressed as.", "NTA", "NTA When my son died we had several well-meaning people ask if we were going to give our subsequent child his name. NO. NO. NO. Not even as a middle name. And it is because of EXACTLY what you stated here. I wanted my kids to be their own person and not have that kind of baggage come with a name they had no choice in choosing. Your father is really missing the mark if he thinks that repeatedly dismissing his (VERY thoughtful) child is something his mother would be proud of. If she is a person worthy of getting bashed with her legacy repeatedly she would and should side with you, or she isn't worthy of all this worship. LIVING family and the relationship you have with them is FAR more important than what anyone calls you. I am so sorry your dad is putting a dead woman (no matter how amazing) before his living child.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not the AH for expressing your perspective and choosing a name that feels more comfortable and authentic to you.

Your dad's grief is understandable, but it shouldn't be a burden that dictates your life. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and comfort.", "NTA . You were right to change it.", "NTA.  That level of bluntness sounds way overdue.", "NTA- you are you. That sounds like a tough situation, always feeling like you needed to be her to be considered valid. \n\nHonestly, I think your dad needs therapy.", "NTA The problem isn't so much the name as it is the expectation you should be that person. Honoring a person by passing down the name is one thing but expecting someone else to be just like that person because they have that name is being an AH.", "NTA. Your dad is an ah and frankly is lucky you haven\u2019t told him to sod off and cut him off given how completely he disregards your feelings every chance he gets. Who fucking cares if your grandma was a saint, the most beautiful woman, a queen, a whatever. The point is you don\u2019t like the name and as it\u2019s YOUR name, you can decide what you want to be called. That he keeps choosing this as his hill to die on, and your mom backing him up shows how entitled an attitude he has and an utter lack of empathy for all you\u2019ve endured with that name.", "NTA. Your dad needed therapy not a daughter to replace his mother! He comes off as a bit toxic and quite self-absorbed, and your mother comes off as an enabler. I would go LC with him if he keeps bothering you. But hope what you said was a wakeup call to him.", "\u201cA rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\u201d  Your dad is ridiculously fixated on the name matching his mother\u2019s.  It\u2019s just a name. It suited her perhaps. It doesn\u2019t suit you. It has nothing to do with your regard for her legacy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If his dad was still alive, his dad should have told him this.\n\nIts not fair that it fell on you to tell him, but... it had to be done.  If your mom reads this, hopefully she can, after your dad calms down, tell him just that.  Sometime the truth hurts, but he needs to understand why he's been unfair to you.\n\n(I have a kinda parallel situation... although I changed my name after my father died... I was named for one of his parents.  I thought that by taking the name of another deceased relative, but on my mom's side, that it would be okay... but... my mom was... equally non-understanding... for similar reasons.)\n\nI hope that your dad can process his feelings and apologize Alyssa (btw, your chosen name is very nice :) ).", "NTA. You were justified in getting worked up enough to lash out with the cold hard truth of the matter. It's a shame it upset him, but maybe if he hadn't pushed so hard to force you to accept the name out of an obligation to your grandmother you wouldn't have been so resistant to it. Names are often given to honor somebody, but it's the person it's now attached to that has to live with it and that doesn't always work well.", "You know, bullies don\u2019t like it when you push back.  Your dad got exactly what he deserved.  You are not your grandmothers never were and it was wrong of hm to put that crap on you your whole life.", "NTA, it's your name.", "NTA.\n\nA hard truth, but dad needed to hear it. He\u2019s only this upset because deep down, he knows you\u2019re right. \n\nYour mother is hurting for him. That\u2019s fair and expected. But that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s right. It doesn\u2019t sound like either of your parents have really examined how unfair it was to use your name as an emotional cudgel while you were growing up. *They* were your first bullies - perhaps unintentionally, but that doesn\u2019t erase the impact it had on you, to be held to a standard you could never meet. To be constantly told your name is an *honor*, and does not truly belong to you. No wonder you felt so little attachment to it! They spent your life reminding you that in their minds, that name belongs to your grandmother, and you\u2019ve only been permitted to borrow it, and should be grateful for the privilege. \n\nLet them lick their wounds. Hopefully, they spend that time doing some serious self-reflection. Your dad in particular. If they value a relationship with you, they\u2019ll take a hard look at your words and find the truth in them. And ideally, when that happens, they\u2019ll approach you with some humility and genuine remorse."]}
