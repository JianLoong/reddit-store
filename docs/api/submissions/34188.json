She was the matriarch of my dad\u2019s side and her death left a great impact. I was the first child in the family born after her death. My mom says she really didn\u2019t want to name me this but my dad strong armed her.\n\nThis name has been difficult for me in a number of ways. My dad refused to let me go by a nickname all throughout my childhood. The other kids still found ways to mock me. Such as calling me \u201cPhil\u201d and telling me I had a boy\u2019s name. Then in my teens, they\u2019d ask me if I wanted to be \u201cfilled\u201d. Now, I know kids can find anything to tease people with but it certainly didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe larger reason it was hard is I felt like I had to live up to a ghost. It doesn\u2019t help I look just like her. I was constantly reminded of the legacy I had to live up to. Any time I made a mistake, I was told I needed to uphold the honor of the name.\n\nKeep in mind, I have always listened to my dad\u2019s stories, learned about the history and I greatly appreciate that I was named after someone so amazing. And I tell my dad this, even though I say I\u2019m not a fan of the name. \n\nIn college, I decided to reinvent myself and began going by Lissa. In time, people began to assume my name was Alyssa and I just went with it. To the point that\u2019s all my friends, colleagues, etc. called me this. My family was aware but would still call me Phyllis which I accepted for the time. My dad made his disappointment clear but I told him all that mattered is he got to to call me it. I also explained why the name was difficult to me several times, both growing up and as an adult and he told me the meaning behind it was greater than bullies and that I should be honored to have such a legacy. \n\nI got married last fall and it was an issue for my dad that the officiant called me Alyssa, that Alyssa was written on all the wedding decorations and invitations. When I went to hyphenate my last name with my husband\u2019s, I also chose to legally change my name to Alyssa. I had my grandmother\u2019s middle name as well my whole life and I kept that as it was never an issue (it\u2019s Marie for those curious).\n\nThe issue for my dad is that his family has grown used to calling me Alyssa. I never asked them to, but they chose to do so. My dad has said that I was wrong to change my name and that I should feel honored. I tried to explain my reasoning and he said it hurt him that I didn\u2019t care enough.\n\nI got mad and said I cared enough to respect him calling me Phyllis and never correcting him. I respected him by always validating his feelings and never telling him he was wrong, while he always brushed mine off. But if he wanted the truth, I wasn\u2019t born to be a reincarnation of his mother. I am my own person and it\u2019s not fair for him to put his grief on me. This really upset him. My mom said I pushed it too far by saying all of that. I feel bad he\u2019s upset but I don\u2019t know if I agree I was wrong.

To be constantly told your name is an *honor*, and does not truly belong to you. No wonder you felt so little attachment to it!

Unfortunately your Dad crossed that line. I don't think he was trying to be malicious, but I do think he was blinded by his own grief and cannot see the pain and damage it has caused you. This is a tough one. It is tough because you love and care for your Dad, your are just not happy with how he handled things and rightfully so. \n\nIf your think he would be receptive to it, you should see about getting some counseling sessions together.

Our Dad was also named after him but with a different middle name (his middle name was after my grandma's Dad's first name). Our family never put those types of expectations on him (or my Dad). The only comparisons that were made were the resemblance that became uncanny as my brother grew up and some of the mannerisms that my brother had that were so similar to my grandpa that it was borderline just not possible but was. Given that my brother never met him or saw any old home movies of him, it was weird at times but in a good way. Right down to the way my brother signed his name...he could have forged checks in grandpas name! \nWhen my brother was about to be born, the family was actually trying to figure out who was going to be called what because there would be three people with the same name in the family lol. Sadly my grandpa passed before my brother was born.  While he never met him, we did show him pictures and explained that he was named after him. We also told my brother all about him and what a good man he was and told family stories. That is where we stopped. My brother had to carve out who he was himself.\n\nOur little dysfunctional family found a way to remember and honor grandpa while also letting my brother be his own person with his own identity.
