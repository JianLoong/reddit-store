My parents live about a two hour flight away and rarely get to see their grand daughter, I think three times since she was born.\n\nFor her one year birthday we had a fairly large culturally (to my wife's family) significant celebration.  I invited my parents to come, got them tickets etc.  All festivities were to be at my in law's house, so I agreed to chauffeur my parents back and forth each day.  On the day of the celebration, after everything winded down, baby was napping, in-laws were napping, my parents were hanging out waiting for the toddler to rouse.  \n\nOnce the older folks woke up around 5pm I received a text from my wife asking me to get my parents out of the house so her sister could spend alone time with the baby.  Her sister was also in from out of town and had driven about 5 hours with her own 11 year old daughter. I will note my wife's sister has also not spent a ton of time with her niece, though it is probably 2-3x the time my own parents have spent with her. Her sister had also invested some in the party itself, running errands and getting things ordered, as I did myself.  Her sister was also departing the following day, whereas my parents were staying for one day more then her.\n\nMy immediate response was confusion, it seemed to me that 'alone aunt time' wasn't really a thing.  My in-laws were lovely, were amazing hosts to my folks, and when I told them my wife was trying to get me to remove my parents from their house they told me to ignore her.  I suggested to wifey that her sis and niece could come upstairs and hang out with the whole group with our daughter, to which she refused to back down, finally telling me she was too busy to talk to me and that I should 'take it up with her sister'.  \n\nDuring this communication things got heated, I had a panic attack, all the parents could tell something was wrong with me and I finally had to tell my own parents, sorry you daughter in law wants you to leave, mostly because I had been trying to gently get them out the door but they weren't taking hints (they're late 70s and 80s).\n\nMy wife continues to insist her stance was completely reasonable and that I was in the wrong.  Because of this I admitted to her that I had tried to get my folks to leave even though I disagreed with it but because they weren't taking hints the only thing I could do was to explicitly tell them they were being asked to leave.

That would have been a hill for me to die on. I would have done what she said and go ask the sister and your in-laws personally. If they wanted your parents to leave. Sounds to me like your wife is the one who secretly hates your parents.", "OP, I am at a loss here.  Most of the time I think each spouse needs to be responsible for communicating with their own parents.  In this case; however, your wife\u2019s request was rude and outright bizarre.  All of you were guests in your in-laws home and they were fine with your parents being there.  Honestly what were you supposed to tell your elderly parents in order to get them to leave?  To be honest, I cannot imagine why your sister in law needed alone time with your toddler.  The mind wanders\u2026. Was she planning to strip, paint herself green and perform a happy dance?", "NTA, but your wife definitely is. Does she hate your parents or something? \n\nI think it's good that you told them and her parents precisely why they had to leave, and didn't cover up for your wife.\n\nOTOH, you should have stood up for your parents. It's your baby, too.\n\nHard convos need to be had with your wife.", "NTA - I was so ready to be on her side but her behavior makes no sense....if there was really a serious issue I feel she would have explained long before that her sister required alone time with the baby. It makes no sense to me. Also feel for you being in that situation of having excited parents you had to push out the door who are old and flew all that way! I'm imagining my own parents in that situation and they would be so crushed and confused at what they did to be told to leave. \n\nForget about your wife you are in the worse position!! Even her family agreed with you! Her sister could easily have gone to another room with your wife to \"bond\" if it was important. Something seems off.", "Ugh.\n\nThis is a tough one.  Bottom line, YNTA and your wife PUT YOU IN A SITUATION.\n\nSo as a couple, you guys need to be a united front.  However, what your wife was asking wasn't very nice, and she could have had time with her sister and the baby upstairs.\n\nSo, you had a panic attack...  You had heavy emotions - so in telling your parents (which she is the one who wanted you to send them away) you had to let them know it wasn't you.\n\nYour wife is asking to have it both ways - \"Get them to leave and don't tell them it's me...\"\n\nIf you told them \"My wife wants to have alone time with her sister and the baby, and asks if you would like to leave for awhile\" - even that is rude.\n\nMaybe your wife expected you to take them to the shopping mall?\n\nSTill, wifey is being unreasonable.\n\nSo I hope the two of you work it out, next time she wants them to leave, she needs to communicate more clearly with you, not put you on the spot, and give you words that will work  - otherwise; she'll have to figure out something else.\n\nYour suggestion that she go upstairs was perfect.\n\nYou could have also said, \"Hey mom and dad, let's go out and do a little shopping...\"  And you could have covered the whole thing up...  Maybe that's what she expected...  but she needs to communicate it.\n\nHope you guys don't fight over this - you guys need to clearly communicate and care about eachother and that goes both ways.  Imagine if you guys had reversed roles and you had asked her to ask her parents to leave so your brother and you could have alone time with the baby...  She's supposed to tell her parents to leave your parents home...????", "NTA but I wouldn't have tried to get them ro leave and hurt their feelings. Wife is an asshole.  Were it me I would have taken my in-laws' advice and simply ignored her. Sounds like her sister is a piece of work.", "NTA, but your wife is. I wouldn\u2018t let my partner treat my parents like that so i guess that does make you a bit of an ah.", "How long were the festivities for? Maybe it was an overstay? Maybe she wanted some alone time with her sister and parents before sister left.", "I\u2019m going with ESH but only because you put the blame solely on your wife. If you needed a blunt statement to get it through to your parents you could have just said it\u2019s time to go. She obviously sucks for telling you to make them leave so her sister could have alone time with baby. No one family member is more deserving of time with a child over another. That said are you certain she wasn\u2019t just overwhelmed with so many people trying to be around/take baby from her. I also have a 1 year old and at a family gathering with many people my child wasn\u2019t familiar with and my child wouldn\u2019t let go of me for hours and it was stressful every time someone else was holding her because she freaked out. I literally had to tell my pushy af sister to stop trying to hold my child because she would cry", "\nWhy has no one asked if his parents spent any alone time with wife to bring this on.   If so did they say anything.? Did they criticise her,   did they stop her sister from spending any time with the baby?  Why is the wife assumed the wrong one here?  Maybe she'd just had enough and wanted some damn peace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
