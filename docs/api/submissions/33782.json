For the last 20 years, most of his relationships have ended due to that. He goes through girlfriends like babies goes through diapers. While I'm not comfortable with that, my opinion doesn't matter. The women he dates are free to make their own choices.\n\nHowever, I do have two problems with this. The first is that the older my father gets, the less his relationships last. Since my son was born, he's introduced us to 8 different girlfriends, their time together lasting anywhere from 3 months to a year.\n\nThe second problem is that my dad expects my kids to get attached to whatever woman he's dating. He invites them to go out with us, volunteers them as babysitters and talks them up to my son, usually to get him to want to spend time with them.\n\nFor the first few years of his life, my son would spend weeks meeting my father's girlfriends and memorizing their features, only for them to vanish from his life a couple months later. Though it saddens me, he's gotten used to it.\n\nWe're spending the holidays with our extended family, and my dad brought along his current girlfriend, \"Patty\" (36F). They've been together for two months, and my kids met her a week ago.\n\nOver this week, Patty has expressed her desire to get close to my kids. Both she and my dad have been trying to get my son to meet her properly. However, my father's routine isn't working this time: my son declines her invitations to play, doesn't interact with her much and hasn't seemingly made any effort to talk to her. He's not impolite, he just doesn't show any interest in her. My daughter is a bit shy, and doesn't seem to want to be around Patty either.\n\nAfter my son didn't acknowledge her at all during Christmas Eve, my father decided to confront me about it. He said he was disappointed in me, as Patty loves my kids and I'm not making any efforts to get them to love her back.\n\nIt took me a while, but I lost my patience. I told him, \"they've known her for a week, she's almost their mom's age, and they'll probably never see her again after a couple months; why should they need to love your girlfriend?\"\n\nMy father was pissed. He's accusing me of raising my kids to be selfish, impolite brats. We had a short fight about it, and he barely spoke to me during Christmas. He also texted me that \"Patty was upset\", so I can only assume he told her.\n\nMy mom, as well as my aunt and cousins, think I did the right thing, and that he needed to hear it. My younger sister thinks I was too harsh, and that I should at least try to get my kids to meet Patty properly.\n\nI have nothing against Patty, but I don't want to force my kids to have a relationship with her.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I'm not sure if Patty knows about my dad's history of cheating. And I say they've been together for 2 months because that's when his last GF broke up with him; I'm pretty sure he was seeing Paula before that.", "created_utc": 1703602245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r9pjf/aita_for_telling_my_father_that_my_kids_dont_need/", "score": 772, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father is the AH in so many ways, but since this is only about his gf getting close to your kids, he is a major AH. \n\nHonestly, I would have put a stop to this a while ago, considering how harmful it can be to someone, especially a child, to constantly be getting attached to people for them to only leave shortly after. It's no wonder your children are acting the way they are, they don't want to get hurt again. \n\nI wouldn't allow my FIL to hurt my children anymore like this, and I would tell him that he has to have been dating his girlfriend for a year before he introduces them to your children. I say a year even if that might seem excessive, purely because you say that's generally the longest these relationships last. So if he can make a year and be committed, then he can introduce them.", "NTA. I honestly would stop letting my kids even meet these women until the relationship has lasted a certain amount of time. Patty wanting to get close with her brand new boyfriend's grandkids is honestly a red flag to me.", "NTA. Your kids only need to be polite and respectful as they should with any adult. They don't need to play with every woman that Grandpa brings home or get close to them. If she sticks around, she can get to know them slowly.

I am glad you put your foot down about this nonsense.", "NTA, there is clearly a pattern and this relationship, just as the others, probably wont last...\n\nAs long as your kids are polite, that is all you can ask from them...\n\nYour father is for sure TA here!", "\"He also texted me that \"Patty was upset\", so I can only assume he told her.\"\n\nIf \"Patty\" was upset, it was probably because she realized that meeting the grandkids wasn't a sign that the relationship is getting serious.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your kids are protecting themselves.", "NTA\nAlso red flag that your kids don\u2019t like Patty. I think they are getting a weird vibe or she has said or done something weird to them, I would talk to them about it.", "Nta. You stated it perfectly to him.", "You did the right thing.  You were not too harsh; you were countering unreasonable demands with truth.  \n\nYour dad doesn't get to manipulate a 5 year old to act close with a series of random women his granddad drags over.  Indeed, other than family holidays when you're probably stuck interacting with his flavor of the week, you might want to try limiting your father's interaction with your son to visits without a woman in tow.  Ever.\n\nNTA", "NTA even remotely. You'd do well to refrain from letting your kids get attached.", "Truth hurts, but it doesn't matter how harsh it was, the fact was you were protecting your children's right to feel how they feel and not force them to care about people that a) won't exist in their lives long, and b) that they don't care about. NTA\n\nI'd consider making a rule that you won't introduce your children to any women your father's been seeing unless they make it to the two year mark, but that even then if the kids show no interest, then your father has to deal with it.", "NTA. I would set solid boundaries with your dad. #1 - his girlfriends are not allowed at your house or on family outings until they have been together for a year. #2 - at family events where he brings his girlfriends, they are not allowed to approach your children. In addition, he cannot introduce his girlfriend to your kids and he is not allowed to suggest things like babysitting. #3 - he can never be with your kids without you present. If he is not willing to accept this rules you should go NC/LC with you, with LC being events at other family members homes where you 100% avoid him (and leave if he approaches your kids).", "NTA. Why do any of you spend time with him?", "NTA\n\nHappened to a friend, fight blew up when the 7 year old exclaimed \"You're really pretty! Just like the last Grandma \u2764\ufe0f\" but in a nice way lmao", "OP needs a new rule, no meeting the gf until at least a year in. Should cut the gfs down by about 2/3.", "Honestly, the only way the OP is the asshole here is for not putting her foot down about introducing shorter term girlfriends to the kids. There needs to be a rule - no girlfriends of less than 6 months introduced to the kids.", "Seriously though. My 5 year old barely even recognizes my best friend she has met dozens of times and been to his house numerous times. The only way she will remember him is if I mention his daughter that is a few years older than mine.", "This\n\nI'd not let my kids near this mess", "Thank you for saying this. If it was 64 and 19, sure, okay, skeevy age gap, but no matter how we spin it, she is a fully grown adult who can make her own choices. And he presumably isn't going around telling women he's a serial cheater."]}
