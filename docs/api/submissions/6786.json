Higher heat means higher bills and you and your other roommate have handled winters perfectly fine before and don't deserve to pay for what your other roommate demands. Also she was briefed on how y'all do things in the winter multiple times and obviously didn't argue originally, so her issues are entirely on her. You're 100% NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to live with people from her planet.", "NTA. If she wants it hotter she can pay for it. None of you are opting into that.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who also always wanted the heat high, and clothes light. But I\u2019ve evolved to comfy sweatpants life and saving $$.", "NTA. If this is something you discussed prior to moving it, she knew about it and agreed. If she wants to raise the heat she can pay the cost difference. It\u2019s that simple.", "NTA. \n\nShe knew the situation before signing on a lease. Bundle up or shut up!", "NTA. This isn't about modesty or control, it's pure practicality in cold climates. I say this currently wearing slippers, socks and a sweater, under a blanket on my couch in my 65 degree house. If someone tells me they are cold, my first comment is to add a layer. Don't run around in shorts and bare feet and tell me you're freezing.\n\nAn alternative could be for her to get a small space heater for her bedroom when she's in it. Would be a lot less expensive than heating the whole house.", "NTA\n\nYour agreed on temps are very comfortable and 75 is ridiculous.", "NTA, makes total sense to me.

You and your other room mate made an agreement that the new girl wasn't privy to.", "NTA. \n\nYou explained the rules coming in. It's stupid to wear summer clothes in winter when you can't afford the extra heating bill... or just in general. \n\nSince you're stuck with her for now, check to see if your lease allows space heaters. Having one in her room might help. Electricity is usually cheaper and she might be more amenable to paying the difference if she can at least dress that way in her room.", "NTA - but you all should have the temp written in your roommate agreement.\n\nAnd obviously her behavior is childish and unreasonable.", "NTA. 67-69 is a completely average temperature lol. Cranking it to 75 in the winter is absurd", "NTA. she sounds like a brat.", "NTA. We keep our heat at 60-65 and we wear pants and socks when it's cold, especially inside. Even have heaters. She needs to dress for the weather ie clothing that covers the belly and back, covers the feet, and covers the legs. Best to cover the upper arms too and wrap up in blankets", "NTA. Granted, I think anything less than 69 is too cold, but 75 is freakishly high. If this was indeed communicated prior to her moving in, then you're definitely NTA. If there's a possibility it was not relayed to her until the weather became cold, then you'll probably all need to come to some sort of agreement about the temp.", "NTA\n\nShe agreed to the living arrangement including not raising the temp due to unsustainable gas bill and it\u2019s reasonable to wear more to stay warm. Hopefully it\u2019s in writing and inform her either she stick to agreement or move out elsewhere or lastly she cop the entire gas bill. At least you gave her reasonable and logical options rather than behave like a child like she did", "NTA. She's totally selfish, and I hope there's a way to not renew her lease after the current year is up. You need to show her historical heating bills and how her habits are making a difference that can be seen on paper. But I have a feeling it won't matter to her. She wants what she wants.", "NTA.\n\nSit down with her, both of you, and tell her it's not about threats or controlling what she wears. It's about affordability. She is new and has no right to just come in and dictate how things should be.\n\nBut also, if it was just you and your other roommate before, surely with this new girl coming in she's also saying towards expenses? So if you and your other roommates personal contribution drops a bit because of this, surely you can afford to put the heat up a bit? Not by so much but just enough to make it a bit more comfortable?\n\nGoing forward, it might be a good idea to have a cohabitation agreement citing the person agrees to a certain temperature.", "NTA. Leave clothes out of it. The agreement is that the heater is left to 68-69. Is it in her contract? If not, then she will need to be billed accordingly as neither of you agreed to have the heat on to this temperature. \n\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d bump it to 70. I wear shorts and a t-shirt in the house at that temperature as I find bundling up in my own house to be dumb and uncomfortable.", "NTA. Her behavior is kinda concerning. Also wearing shorts and crop tops inside in winter is silly to me. That is summer attire. Winter indoors wear is long pants, house coats, sweaters, onesies etc\u2026\n\nEdit: I do think 67 is pretty cold. 69-70 seems more reasonable to me, fwiw.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
