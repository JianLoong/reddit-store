I absolutely *hate* layers and warm clothing. Its a sensory issue for me, I cannot stand feeling long sleeves and pants shifting around my body like loose skin. It makes my skin crawl. I want to be comfortable in my own home, and for me that means as little clothing as I can get away with. Even in the midwest winter when it gets in the negatives. This is entirely my choice, and I am fortunate to live with my parents who also prefer it warmer and have the means to pay for it. \n\nHOWEVER, when I was in college I lived in the same exact situation as you. Three of us splitting rent with my two roommates preferring colder temperature and bundling up vs me preferring higher temps and less clothing. \nI didn't really like it, but if I got too cold I would crawl under my covers or bundle up in a throw blanket until I warmed up. I understood that heating is expensive and being in college we couldn't afford to pony up for a more expensive heating bill. Even though it wasn't really a compromise, their preference was more financially viable so it wasn't really something we would change.\n\nShe can figure out how to warm up while maintaining the attire of her choice if, like me, she can't handle bundling up, but it should not be on you and your older roommate to fix that for her considering the financial burden. Either she(her parents) pay the difference for heating, or she uses a blanket like me, buys a space heater, or just deals with it, especially since you both made it immediately clear this is how you do things in the winter. \n\nThe only possible situations where you would be the asshole is if you never mentioned this at all, or in a world where A/C usage wasnt so absurdly expensive.
