I always tried to protect her, but my wife and I were only able to get custody threw years ago. We adopted her, and she's a good kid at heart, but she still struggles a lot. She's still in therapy and has come so far, but finds it difficult to accept unconditional love and that kids don't have to be perfect. While she's usually fine with my wife and I, she still sometimes tends to see our daughter (Chloe) as ungrateful and spoilt. I've worked really hard on this, and it's a LOT better, but sometimes it comes up in their teenage squabbles. It's not perfect but the girls generally get along. \n\nLast Friday they had an issue. I was at work, so this is based on what I was told after. Chloe was refusing to do any of her chores, and arguing about it with my wife. Charlotte jumped in and basically called Chloe lazy and said that she should be a better daughter like her. Apparently my wife got pissed off and told her off. She 'reminded' her that she was 'lucky' we were taking care of her and to stay out of it. From there it got bad.\n\nMy wife says that Charlotte was extremely rude about Chloe. But she also admits she told Charlotte that we 'didnt have to' take care of her, and that basically unlike Chloe, we can send her back to her parents if she keeps it up. Ignoring the fact we legally cannot, that's just completely fucked up. They ended their fight with Charlotte just going to my parents for that night, and she's been really upset and withdrawn since.\n\nWhen I got home my wife filled me in, and I was honestly pretty furious. The first thing that came to mind was 'what the fuck is wrong with you?'. Which admittedly wasn't a productive response but I was honestly just floored. The issue is that Charlotte doesn't get that a kid deserves unconditional love even if they're not perfect, so you fucking tell her that you'll kick her out if she doesn't behave? All the progress I worked with her for is gonna be shut back again. \n\nI was mad and we fought about it. I get she can be difficult, but that was inappropriate. However she's still refused to apologise or anything. I've tried to talk to her and explain that we love her, and that it wasn't meant the way it was said. But my wife is just accusing me of babying and favouring Charlotte. Apparently I'm being unreasonable thinking what she did was disgusting. That I should care more about Chloe, as if this is a competition. \n\nI am still honestly pretty pissed at her.

Your wife needs to apologize and looks like you're gonna have to have individual long talks with everyone", "NTA\n\nYou are correct here. It doesn't sound like you are favoring Charlotte at all. You aren't condoning or excusing her behavior. You issue is with how your wife dealt with the behavior, which I agree was completely inappropriate. \n\nYour wife (and you) ADOPTED the child. She is your child. She can't be given back. And threatening to return her to an abusive situation is basically abuse in and of itself. Your wife should never suggest such a thing and should be ashamed that those words came out of her mouth.", "NTA Wow. Your wife threatened to send your niece back to the parents that abused her if she didn't remember her place in your house.\n\nThat poor girl has been abused and was beginning to think she was safe in your home. All that hard work is gone.", "Nta - a correct response would be \"Charlotte, I'm the parent and will handle Chloe. Please apologize for calling her lazy and go hang out in your room while Chloe and I talk.\" \n\nYou need to talk with your wife. She obviously doesn't love Charlotte that much and even in the way you speak about the situation, \"all the progress *I* worked on with Charlotte\" implies that she's actually not that great of a caretaker and doesn't want her.", "NTA\n\nCharlotte has just been told that she is not loved and wanted. She was told that she will be sent back to her parents to live if she doesn't behave. You wife has single-handedly confirmed Charlotte's worst fears.\n\nKids squabble but your wife threw gasoline on a burning match.\n\nYou did the right thing in telling her off for undoing what you have been trying to fix with Charlotte. Honestly though, all of you need to be in therapy. Chloe because it sounds like she resents Charlotte. Your wife because it sound like she didn't want Charlotte. You because your dealing with the mess.", "NTA that was not just inappropriate but abusive! Your wife just emotionally abused a child who has already been abused and traumatized, I don't know you but I'm furious she deserves a hell of a lot better mother figure!!!", "NTA - IMO it seems that you wife really isn't happy that Charlotte is party of your immediate family now. IDK how much discussion you had with your wife or how reluctant she might have been but it doesn't seem to me that she's exactly open arms about the situation. Which totally sucks because Charlotte needs a loving family, not just one that doesn't abuse her. It seems that you are putting in all the work to make Charlotte feel loved but maybe the rest of the household isn't reciprocating that. \n\n>But my wife is just accusing me of babying and favouring Charlotte. Apparently I'm being unreasonable thinking what she did was disgusting. That I should care more about Chloe, as if this is a competition.\n\nIDK how your daughter feels about Charlotte, but it seems that you wife is jealous of her for your daughter. At minimum your wife should apologize for essentially saying \" you don't act how I want you to and we will send you back to your abusive parents\". Honestly if you can afford to you should probably look into family counseling.", "NTA\n\nI do think a discussion with your wife is warranted once heads have cooled a bit to stress the importance of being mindful of Charlotte's trauma and doing things like this can be counter-productive and make things worse long term.\n\nYour wife is not wrong to want to establish boundaries on how she parents her children just how she approached it in the moment did a lot more harm than good.\n\nShe likely hasn't apologized because she feels justified in that boundary but hasn't yet accepted there are better ways to establish them.", "NTA You need to explain to your wife that abuse is not just physical, it's emotional and mental as well. \n\nAnd telling a child that if they misbehave, they will be \"sent back\", IS ABUSIVE!!! \n\nI think family counseling may be good for all of you. \n\nBut your wife is 100% tAH", "Info: did your wife have any input on the process of adopting your niece, or was it a \"I'm doing it so you better get on board\" kind of thing?", "Instead of passing judgment I think you all need to get into family therapy pronto.", "Oof maybe show your wife this post and comments. She\u2019s defending herself after saying something so fucked up..that\u2019s really concerning. You guys adopted her, there is no sending Charlotte back. NTA.", "NTA. And I'm not sure that your wife wanted to adopt Charlotte as much as you did. She's being emotionally abusive to a child she knows was abused; that is beyond being an asshole, that's being a cruel monster. \n\nYes, Charlotte should not be allowed to lash out at Chloe whenever she gets triggered. She should not attack Chloe's character and get away with it just because of her traumatic childhood. But literally digging into her fresh wounds isn't remotely an appropriate way to correct her behavior, and that's exactly what your wife did. \n\nI can understand her not wanting to let Chloe feel bullied in her own home --and abused children can become bullies--, but she's completely out of line. She accuses you of favoring Charlotte, when what she did was to make a clear difference between the kids and tell Charlotte that she isn't her daughter and isn't entitled to the same kind of unconditional love Chloe is, so \"better watch it or I'll abandon you\". This could not only be a setback in Charlotte's emotional healing. It could very well be a catastrophic event that sends her deeper down the hole. \n\nWhat your wife did is what I'd consider unforgivable. But the only possible place to start repairing it is by apologizing to Charlotte. If she refuses, then you will have to face the ugly truth that you're married to an emotionally abusive woman and raising two young and impressionable girls under her influence. Which you shouldn't.", "NTA - poor girl.\n\nYou and your wife are definitely on different pages you have taken this girl and she is yours just like Chloe is yours. Your wife has accepted that Charlotte is part of your family but doesn't sound like she has accepted she is equal to Chloe. Your wife apparently does not understand unconditional love either. Maybe family therapy is called for.\n\nThings can look fine but maybe there are issues you and your wife did not expect to come up and are hard to deal with.", "NTA\n\nIt would be helpful to have the ages of the children to get some additional context but I will give a verdict regardless. \n\nCharlotte is not your niece, she is effectively your daughter and should be treated equally to your own biological one. The initial comment your wife made makes it sound like you are only doing this as a favour to her and she expects obedience in return. This is just outrageous. \n\nIf your own daughter is not doing her chores here is the logical conclusion that Charlotte will come to. \"It doesn't matter if Chloe does her chores or not she will still be the favourite.\"\n\nYou are completely right in your point of view. Children can be difficult, with that information we shouldn't just threaten to send them back to an abusive household. \n\nThe only sticking point is the language you used for your wife in your initial reaction. I'd pencil that down to spur of the moment frustration so NTA for that.\n\n>She 'reminded' her that she was 'lucky' we were taking care of her and to stay out of it.\n\nOh how privileged Charlotte is being born into a mum and dad who don't care for them and having to be rescued by uncle and aunt. Ask your partner to check the definition of privileged.", "NTA\n\nYour wife was cruel. It\u2019s literally that easy to undo the work you are doing to make charlotte feel like she is part of the family.\n\nI mean, that\u2019s literally Disney villian level stuff, and that she doesn\u2019t get that is a red flag.\n\nSounds like your wife isn\u2019t as Ok with your niece being part of your family as she should be. You are not being unreasonable at all and clearly you two need to further discuss why she wants to \u201cother\u201d your niece so badly.", "NTA\n\nFully fucked up for your wife to say that. You sound like a great Dad and understand that both these girls are your responsibility and not going to be dragged into picking sides.\n\nI feel really bad for Charlotte as your wife has basically vocalised the insecurities she must have being adopted. Good luck with fixing this and hopefully your wife can apologise to Charlotte and try and repair this", "Okay, I\u2019m going to say ESH\n\nI feel like what your wife said is absolutely unacceptable, and Charlotte is absolutely owed an apology. And you should absolutely be pissed about it. \n\nHowever if this is what she said, I want to know how she felt about the adoption in the first place, because it looks like to me she wasn\u2019t one hundred percent on board and if she was \u201cforced\u201d into accepting it.\n\nEdit. I\u2019ve read your responses, specifically one that states you would have left your wife if she wasn\u2019t on board with the adoption, to me personally, it seems like your wife at least knew she had to accept this or you were leaving, and quite frankly, that isn\u2019t fair to her. I also get the sense that Charlotte is favoured over Chloe, again not fair. We\u2019re you all in therapy before the adoption took place? It\u2019s certainly needed now as it seems the resentment has reached a boiling point", "NTA!!! I would have responded the same way!!!! It\u2019s not babying and favoring when you are trying to teach a traumatized child to love and trust!!! Heck I\u2019d be p!ssed if my husband said something similar to our bio kids. If you\u2019ve adopted her they are both your daughters and should be treated as such. Unfortunately being fair isn\u2019t always equal and equal isn\u2019t always fair. Both girls (and your wife) need to learn this!!! The most important thing I can suggest is that your wife learns to apologize to the girls.", "NTA.  Well, your wife pretty much just confirmed every single one of Charlotte\u2019s trauma induced fears.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your wife is on board with adopting Charlotte and being a real mother to her.  Charlotte acted like a sibling to Chloe and told her to stop being a whiny brat, and your wife, rather than seeing that Chloe was being a whiny brat, or that Charlotte was acting like a normal older sister to call out the \u201cspoiled baby\u201d, told Charlotte that she was disposable if she stepped out of line.  She reinforced every fear and continued the abuse.  \n\nI\u2019d have a hard time forgiving this abuse of one of my vulnerable children from my spouse.  Particularly since your wife still doesn\u2019t see the problem.", "NTA, but you should try not to overreact to things. I think your niece was overstepping a bit, but I agree that what your wife said was hurtful. Everyone should apologize.", "You gotta make your wife a single mom in the future bro, the streets are gonna reclaim her\n\nNTA you are the hero", "ESH, it seems lile because of a rough past you're excusing Charlotte intentionally antagonizing Chloe. Your wife seems to have hit her limit of watching her daughter suffer because of someone else's kid.", "This might be the hill to stand on\u2026 that\u2019s really messed up, and your wife just set her therapy back - years.

Was she really 100% behind the decision to adopt your niece?  Because it almost sounds like she regrets it.", "That's exactly what I think.

I thought we were that before this. And given how upset Charlotte is, I'd say she did too.\n\nThe girls do generally get along. Chloe knows (age appropriate) about her parents, and that the issues aren't about her. And I definitely do what I can to make sure Chloe knows she's loved and all that. I don't think Chloe is jealous, so I would definitely say it's my wife's issue.", "Yeah what the wife did is very awful, the damage done their is going to take long to wear away. Awful way to treat a child that came out of an abusive family, and even worse that their new mom is now being emotionally abusive yet again.

What looks like normal teen squabbling to you is Charlotte lashing out because of her trauma (she was trained to be a good daughter or she would be abused) and Chloe more than likely resenting Charlotte for all the time and energy she feels you put into your relationship with Charlotte.\n\nYou may not have sprung this decision on your wife, but Carlotte's and Chloe's behaviors are putting pressure on her to deal with it. I do think that what she said was in the heat of the moment, but there is a kernel of truth there that she hasn't give voice too, so it made her say what she did.", "I\u2019m curious\u2026when you got custody and adopted\u2026have things been a lot harder than you guys anticipated? Also were you given any training on how to handle traumatized children? (I don\u2019t know if you went through the foster system or not where you live and what they offer.) I have spoken to adults who adopted through the system 10+ years ago where we live. There was no training for the parents. Because of this it caused a lot of issues as they didn\u2019t know how to care for the emotional and psychological needs of the child. I also know a family who adopted from an orphanage over seas. They had some training but it wasn\u2019t even close to what was needed so they knew what to expect. Because of that their child ended up going into a facility because they decided it wasn\u2019t a good place for the child or their family. (Child was making a lot of accusations of abuse against the parents and other children.)", "You might still have to make that decision. It seems like your wife is going to continuously reverse the effort and love you\u2019re trying to give charlotte, while putting chole on a pedestal you don\u2019t seem to see but are trying to battle. You\u2019re in a horribly difficult situation and I wish you all the luck. NTA.", "I read this part of your post as well, where you say Charlotte judges Chloe for not being \"grateful\" for her parents and her life. \n\nWhile I 100% agree with you that it is a toxic mindset for Charlotte to have (and one that stems from the abuse she was subjected to), you are very right in teaching her that it is wrong... I have to wonder if Chloe isn't actually acting more entitled, bratty, and \"ungrateful\" than you are aware of?\n\nI mean, given the fact your wife is so nonchalantly open about telling Charlotte she's lesser than Chloe and that she better learns her place, basically... it's not illogical to think she's creating a dynamic where Chloe feels superior and entitled to love and approval just because she's a bio daughter, and acting like it around Charlotte. \n\nThat still wouldn't make it right for Charlotte to attack Chloe, but it would definitely change the perspective over why she is so triggered.", "I'd say have a polite conversation with your partner. Help them see the error in the ways and come up with an idea that will actually make Charlotte feel part of the family. Maybe its time to get some family portraits done or something. \n\nContinue the therapy for Charlotte and try as cooperative parents come up with a chore schedule that both children have to adhere to. If they do not treat and punish them equally.\n\nCharlotte may not understand unconditional love but Chloe does seem very happy to exploit it it seems. Just a thought.", "As far as I know this is the first time it's come up like this. Charlotte definitely would have reacted obviously in the past. \n\nChloe and her do get along mostly. I definitely don't think Chloe is a problem, beyond being a typical teenager", "I know it's not been easy. But that's why she should apologise and try to fix it. The fact she stands by it, rather than seeing it as a heat of the moment mistake, is the issue.\n\nI've always tried to have the balance. Charlotte treats her a lot better now, and she generally treats Chloe well. \n\nThe kids are just smart arses and squabble like a lot of sibling, but at the end of the day they're relatively close. I'd say this was more a sibling being a pain, than Charlotte focussing on Chloe. She knows to butt out, and generally does, but like a lot of kids sometimes she says stuff about her sibling.", "Defend a grown-ass woman from a 12 year old who thinks she has to be perfect and obedient in order to be loved?", "Depends what you mean by defwnd I guess. Its not hardcore punishment, but I don't just let her act out. I definitely work with Chloe as well to make sure she knows we love her, and that Charlotte's outbursts aren't about her (because really, they aren't). \n\nThis wasn't some crazy insult though. It was just a petty sibling squabble, basically. While obviously I'd act, it wouldn't need some serious punishment.", "It definitely was hard. Why it wasn't a surprise per se, she was initially really difficult for my wife, since her mum had been the primary abuser. It took almost a year for her to stop entering her perfect-out-of-fear mode around my wife. We haven't had much from the state, but my parents help a lot with both girls where they can. \n\nI got a lot of advice from her therapists and everything though. Which helped a lot.", "I think Chloe is just a normal teenage girl. I wouldn't say she's spoilt. Sometimes she's lazy or thinks she knows best, but nothing more than I hear from other parent friends. The two girls do generally get along. They have sibling banter and can be a bit snarky to each other, but I really wouldn't describe it the way you do.", "We already have a chore system, and I'd say it's treated equally. Chloe was just being lazy and she didn't want to do them, that doesn't mean it's not equal or set.\n\nI genuinely don't understand, what did Chloe exploit? She literally did nothing. Unless you mean not joining in the argument is the issue, which I don't think is reasonable. Chloe doesn't mistreat Charlotte, it's mostly normal older sibling stuff.", "I hope so. But I find it difficult to believe your wife's attitude hasn't come out in subtle ways before. I am highly disappointed in your wife. It would have been bad enough with her initial behavior. But she has doubled down and says you are overreacting. Really? She clearly has little to no maternal feeling for Charlotte. Charlotte has now lost a second mother. I wish you and your family well. NTA.", "It\u2019s ONE of the issues, yes.  And I agree your wife owes an apology.\n\nBut it\u2019s clearly not been easy for anybody, your wife included.  She\u2019s apparently had a long time of being blanket-distrusted.\n\nThis could also open the door for a discussion about minding one\u2019s own business.  A conversation between your wife and Chloe does not need Charlotte\u2019s input.\n\nI know Charlotte is in therapy, but is anyone else in the family?  Seems it might be useful to get some tools to navigate these kinds of situations, so that everyone feels heard.", "I can\u2019t speak for everyone else but what I am getting from these comments is that you need to be certain that Chloe isn\u2019t manipulating the situation and using your wife to do this. It reminds me of recently divorced parents who don\u2019t realize for quite some time that their children are playing the parents against each other. It can be very subtle. What seems to be pointed out here is that Chloe may be very adept at using her status as the \u2018real\u2019 daughter with your wife and picking at her sister or refusing to do chores (which yea is typical teenager) but with the mindset of intentionally causing problems with Charlotte/you/your wife or any combination thereof to feed her emotional desire to be defended as the \u2018real\u2019 daughter. \n\nCharlotte needs to not step in to parent her sister but your wife needs to learn to handle that overstep and frustration better. I\u2019m concerned if she went off the handle the way she did over Charlotte butting in to a discussion with the other child. She was clearly upset with Chloe originally but there is no sign that her frustration here went nuclear yet when Charlotte commented something, which was actually positive towards your wife by the way, she went nuclear on Charlotte.

Knock off the threats and the insults, and backtrack to the start to reset things. Your wife isn't Charlotte's mom, and you need to stop shoving that down her throat like she's a pate goose, or she'll continue to lash out and bite at both you and Charlotte. You likely could have gotten a friendly aunt or supportive adult type relationship out of your wife if you hadn't insisted on \"love her like her own mommy.\"\n\nYou really should not have threatened your wife with divorce to make her agree to this. Getting a *dog* is an all yes, one no situation, and this is a very traumatized human.

It does seem you're about to pass the point of no return, where you will either have to divorce, or your wife will say no more, she's not going to care about your threats, and sends Charlotte to your parents.

How conscientious have you been about making certain your time is split perfectly evenly, or just a hair skewed in Chloe's favor? All of your comments are about them fighting and how it's fine, which makes me think, no, it's not fine at all. Charlotte's \"better daughter\" comment seems like she is trying to pee a circle around you, and Chloe and your wife are not having it. \n\nETA: be extremely careful as well because you WANT your wife to tell you stuff like this and be open with you. If you try to use what she told you to punish her, she'll simply stop being honest. Married people need to be able to trust that they can tell their partner something awful without getting attacked.

You don\u2019t sound very open to feedback about her behavior and maybe your wife simply does not want to be in this situation where she is also not getting enough support.

Raising kids and being apart of a family brings in its on stresses but there are external circumstances that will compound those stresses even more. The girls are teens and would benefit from therapy even if all things were good. It is difficult enough for adults to always healthily handle situations even more so for kids and teens. While your daughter appears to being handling everything well she too may feel some resentment. Kids naturally feel like they are competing with siblings and peers and she may need an outlet to come to terms with her feelings. Your adopted daughter always has a history of being shown how things shouldn't be managed and I can imagine the internal struggle she must face everyday. You are correct in saying that your wife's actions have led to a major set back. \n\nI hope this is an out of character occurrence for your wife but it may not be. I liken this to a step parent situation. There are amazing step parents who have wholeheartedly view the children in their household as there own. While there are many who can't get past the fact that they are not biologically theirs and will always put their own before others.

Adoptions like this almost always require two or three or four times as much emotional labor (and often financial sacrifice) than you think they will, and and there will ALWAYS be speed bumps along the way.

Everyone needs to sit down and talk about it and apologize to each other. Charlotte needs to apologize to both your wife and daughter for butting in to the conversation, your wife needs to apologize for blowing up the way that she did to Charlotte, and you need to apologize to your wife for saying that something was wrong with her when all she did was defend her daughter. \n\nFamily therapy would be good.", "THEY adopted her. not HE. THEY. she\u2019s also a parent to Charlotte by law. idk what be you\u2019re spewing rn.", "i wish this was the top comment - hell even Peter Parker who was raised and adopted by aunt may still cAlled her AUNT May. i feel for the kid because she\u2019s told that she had a new mom now when she has an aunt - and that\u2019s okay.  now this situation is so messy", "I will tell you how she could say that: Mama Bear. \nOur kids can be difficult sometimes but as soon as someone else tries to attack them, real mothers fight back.\n\nNothing is more precious than our own kids. \n\n\nCharlotte had no right to treat your daughter like this. It was not her problem or something she has a say on it. \n\n\nYour wife might have accepted Charlotte in your life to please you as you threatened her with a divorce but her child comes first and she will fight for her. She is right. \n\n\nAre you once again going to threaten her with a divorce if she doesn\u2019t apologize to a pest who thinks she is better than your kid?", "Saying that to her legal daughter is actually abusive. Seriously. You don't threaten to send a 12 year old child back to her abusers for having a big mouth. That's just another type of abuse.\n\nI think this poor girl has found herself in another abusive environment. It's just so sad.", "where is your sister and BIL now? why do you think your sister is abusive? does Charlotte feel safe at your parents house?", "Now your wife has destroyed that progress. Charlotte will never look at her the same way again and even if they manage to be cordial or friendly with each other, a little voice at the back of Charlotte\u2019s head will always remind her of what her adoptive mom really thinks of her.", "This! You are the asshole. I knew there had to be missing info. Sounds like you have been prioritizing Charlotte over your wife and daughter for awhile now. It\u2019s terrible that Charlotte has had a rough upbringing but you have literally just inserted a kid into the lives of two other people regardless of how it effects them or how they feel  and you just want everyone to play happy family.", "No it is not standard sibling stuff but as you grew up with an abuser as a sibling you might not see that her daughter does the same thing to your daughter.", "Yes. I came here to say exactly this. Your wife resents charlottes presence. The fact that she has no remorse shows she doesn\u2019t want her there and the first opportunity she got she told her how she really felt about her. Charlotte was right btw. She probably should have minded her own business but she\u2019s a kid and sadly thought she was supporting your wife. I feel for your niece.", "He threatened his wife with divorce if she didn't agree with adopting Charlotte. \nShe stayed because she loved him", "Nothing, he said in previous comment lines that this was not the first time Charlotte told Chloe to be a better kid. Not to mention she didn't want Charlote in the first place, which is kind of understandable  in a messed up way. \nBut to force someone to adopt a child they did not want to adopt is messy", "Actually be sane, it's their niece, that was being abused by  their fucking sister.\n\nThe battle for custody took years and in that entire time period, a grown ass women had the choice to be actively involved or divorce amicably. Good lord that someone looks out for their family.\n\nHey since you posted 2 minutes ago, why don't you go look at all their other comments showing that OP is actively involved and the 2 teens get along.\n\nJesus Christ, individualism has rotted the brains of every generation it comes across. No sense of moral obligation to family or friends when it comes to providing support to those in grievous conditions.\n\nGrow up.", "How does one incident turn into Charlotte being \"regularly judgmental and unkind\"?", "NAILED IT !!!", "glad to see I could trigger someone today \ud83e\udd17", "Lol what? I fought with my siblings all the time growing up but I'd take a bullet for either of them", "Psycho shit, oh my fucking god.   \nPEOPLE CAN THREATEN DIVORCE IF THE BASIC CONDITIONS THEY NEED AREN'T MET AND IT ISN'T ABUSIVE", "> You think marriage is a joke just to issue ultimatums and expect things to work out?\n\nPutting the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness towards a child that has been denied those rights over the sanctity of marriage is a just, moral and sane priority to make and one that my own partner would rightfully toss to me the curb over if I refused to assist in being a guardian for any of the extended children of her family that may have needed it.\n\nSome boundaries are morally non-negotiable and those are one of those boundaries where I would fault no one for seperating.", "The adult was the one being a bully, not Charlotte.", "This is such a Reddit comment. Dude takes in a neglected girl, tries to make progress in breaking the barriers she (naturally) built up... and you find a way to twist into how he just cares about himself. Could it be that he is simply saddened to have lost the progress for her sake? Nope, it must be he just cares about how it affects him. \n\nContext isn't enough. If you have two kids and one bullies another, you don't threaten the bully with kicking them out. OP made something clear, the bullying was insults. Not violence, no threats.", "Oh Jesus. \n\nThat poor kid", "Naw, I would call the wife a bad person as it\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault she is there and her saying all the BS she did to the child is out of bounds. Her beef should have been with the husband but she took it out on the girl. That\u2019s bush league.", "Dude didn't take in a neglected girl. He pressured his wife who he had a young child with to take on the responsibility of mothering a traumatized girl who specifically has issues with female authority figures. She didn't want to take her in for unspecified reasons, he forced her to at the threat of destroying her life and seperating her from her bio daughter (which can happen when two parents divorce and the man is the primary breadwinner) and out of a sense of obligation to this relative of his he has not only placed the adopted daughter in an environment where only he was enthusiastic about bringing her in, but she has a history of bullying the younger sister and belittling her while also constantly working against OP's wife. I'm not justifying her choice of words or doubling down, but I can see how someone who is as dismissive as her role in parenting both girls in his comments and also admitted to being the only one who really wanted to adopt would drive someone fucking insane and make them eventually act out in a hurtful or inapproproate way.", "She should have said so in time.", ">Dude didn't take in a neglected girl.\n\nWhat makes you say this?", "100%. As a matter of fact it should have been required for the adoption to take place and should have been ongoing", "Ok, group/family therapy is in order, but I couldn't stay with someone who could say that to a child and then double down. Period.", "The wife has bubbling resentment over how long? She shouldn't have said that and is T A in this battle.\n\nBut OP forcing an adoption or getting a divorce is T A in the overall war.\n\nWhy don't we use the correct term here and say *ESH* except the neice thrown into this mess maybe.\n\nThough It sounds like neice tried to get wife's approval by putting her daughter, and wife went mama bear & resentment boiled over, yikes!\n\nThe whole family needs therapy.\n\nYikes, adoptions should be willing and come from a place of love... not coercion & threats to break up a family...", "And suppose it\u2019s from him, where did his come from? Why can\u2019t it begin with her?", "They're making it up to fit their opinion.", "She should have said so before embarking in this mess. OP was open about it, sha made the ultimate decision. Not fair to take it out on an innocent child.", "This!!!!", "I love everything about this comment.\n\nI\u2019m curious: are you also wondering what Charlotte said (that OP omitted) during this argument? Unless his wife lost the plot, I don\u2019t know how we go from \u201cCharlotte called Chloe spoiled\u2026\u201d to \u201c\u2026 so I told her we would send her back to her abusive parents.\u201d", "The reason you aren\u2019t making progress is because your wife is as bad as her other parents. \n\n100% your wife is shit to her behind closed doors and anyone can see it", "I am so sorry. Op, I am sure your family are already in a therapy. Looks like your wife may be resentful of Charlotte.\n\nI used to live with a family. They were very nice to me but it was hard.", "i would honestly take Charlotte and your wife in a room, and tell Charlotte, loud and clear, that before anyone returns her, you'll rather divorce your wife. \n\nAt least me reading this would say that, and 100% mean it. Your wife's fucked in the head in my opinion. \n\nYour wife is behaving like a child.", "I hate to be an ass but your wife has shown her true colors and feelings about Charlotte. You are NTA but your wife sure is.", "This is absolutely brutal and I\u2019m so sorry you (and Charlotte) are going through it. To snap is unfortunate, but pretty universal, but then you sincerely apologise and try to mitigate the harm. This sounds like such a painful situation, but I\u2019m really glad Charlotte has you in her corner.", "Your wife may not be the person you thought. What she said and how she treats your niece is sick and so very cruel. It's emotionally and psychologically abusive. I wouldn't want anything to do with such a person.", "I'm really curious how your wife treats Charlotte when you're not around, OP. It sounds like she heavily favors Chloe and actively resents Charlotte. \n\nYou need to get to the bottom of this and come up with a plan to protect your niece from further cruelty from your wife.", "Does your wife believe it is ok to threaten to kick out her daughter or does that only apply to your niece? I\u2019m just curious if the same rule apply to both girls? It almost seems like she really views Charlotte as her daughter even though she adopted. It almost seems like she is treating Charlotte like charity and that she should be grateful. If your daughter is seeing this than she is learning to treat Charlotte the same way. It\u2019s honestly giving Cinderella vibes", "Your wife acts like a bratty child.", "She said it and defends it because she believes it", "NTA OP, your wife said something awful to child struggling when she should have had her support. Good luck dealing with this \u270c\ufe0f", "family comes first. especially when a child is being abused you don\u2019t want to step in and help bc what?", "That's not what boundaries are.", "OPs wife is not obliged to consider Charlotte \u201cher daughter\u201d. Regardless of how much one may love their husband and their family - and sometimes actually precisely because they do so - one cannot force themselves to feel things for other people\u2019s children, especially if they\u2019re troubled teens who\u2019re in therapy. \nYou can\u2019t expect someone to automatically feel like they have \u201ctwo daughters\u201d, OPs niece is his niece, not his wife\u2019s.", "I think the wife\u2019s feeling would be quite correct in this case.", "Can't believe how much I scrolled before finding your comment. You're right this is definitely an ESH situation.\n\nThe wife is very obviously an AH for all the things she said and taking out her resentment on an abused kid.\n\nOP is AH for basically forcing the adoption on his reluctant wife. Ffs she's his partner, and they have a teenage daughter. Adoption is a big decision and his own family should be a priority before deciding to adopt his sister's kid, but have OP even properly considered their feelings and how much this would impact them? OP was instead very insistent on doing what he thought was morally (or heroically) correct at the cost of his family's stance on this. Oh I can even tell from his comments that he's already dead set on making his wife and daughter AH without thinking their behaviour might be a result from deeper issues.\n\nWell, his poor life decisions are now breaking apart his own family and surely not helping the abused kid's trauma.", "Naw, he\u2019s not an asshole. He protected his niece.\n\nThe mother is a grown ass woman who can make her own decisions. She choose this and is now taking it out on the child. She\u2019s the asshole.", "Or any child like that.", "So she\u2019s supposed to sacrifice her own child growing up with her father because she didn\u2019t want to raise her niece? That\u2019s not fair to her at all.", "You chose your niece over your own daughter if you would\u2019ve divorced your wife for Charlotte. That\u2019s maybe why you wife is resentful. And sounds like Charlotte is bullying Chloe. Was she doing it before you got custody? That\u2019s not normal sibling squabbles. But with a sister like yours, maybe you don\u2019t see that.", "He told his wife that he had decided that he had decided to adopt Charlotte no matter what. Is there an implicit threat of divorce if wife is not onboard? Yes. But saying \"he apparently threatned divorce if they didn't adopt Charlotte\" is an unfair characterization.", "Where did OP say that?", "I mean that mildly changes things but like you don\u2019t say that to a kid, adopted or otherwise.", "But it was a threat to leave his bio daughter and break up her family for the niece/daughters sake. That\u2019s why the wife caved. And she\u2019s still trying to protect her daughter from this bullying behavior if the niece, though she went too far. OO sounds like a bully himself and we know his sister was abusive. Poor Chloe.", "You\u2019re talking to a brick wall here at aita where they think the wife has no agency of her own and couldn\u2019t have said \u201cno\u201d if she didn\u2019t want to do this.", "Mom has said this once (to our knowledge) and it's awful. At the same time, Charlotte is a bully to Chloe and has been belittling her in this way for a while now - OP says there's a history of it. Did you read the post?", "Now you\u2019re trying to accuse OP of being an abuser and bully because his sister was one?\n\nWhat great logic as always at aita\u2026", "Meant to add *simply*, since he didn't. He wasn't taking on the girl as his responsibility. He was married and already a father. Ergo, by taking her on, he was making her the family's responsibility. It's just dismissive to claim that him adopting her was \"him taking on a neglected girl\" when he was acting as a unit, not on his own. His comments also read like he doesn't consider his wife to be doing any work, he only speaks about the work he has personally put in even though his wife and bio daughter both seem ro be around Charlotte more (and wife has had a significantly greater struggle due to Charlotte's history and attitude toward women in authority). Basically, it is wrong to paint him as just a good guy trying to do the right thing when his actions have directly (and to an extent, negatively) impacted everyone involved.", "EXACTLY", "This is the comment I was waiting for. I can\u2019t imagine loving someone who is awful enough to treat a child how the wife treats Charlotte. OP is screwed. He\u2019s probably going to lose Charlotte if he tries to stay with his wife and if he leaves his wife, he will lose his daughter. The wife seems the type to alienate the dad, based on her treatment of the niece.", "The Niece IS his family. Stop trying to make this about one being more important then the other."]}
