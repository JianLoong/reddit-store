I always tried to protect her, but my wife and I were only able to get custody threw years ago. We adopted her, and she's a good kid at heart, but she still struggles a lot. She's still in therapy and has come so far, but finds it difficult to accept unconditional love and that kids don't have to be perfect. While she's usually fine with my wife and I, she still sometimes tends to see our daughter (Chloe) as ungrateful and spoilt. I've worked really hard on this, and it's a LOT better, but sometimes it comes up in their teenage squabbles. It's not perfect but the girls generally get along. \n\nLast Friday they had an issue. I was at work, so this is based on what I was told after. Chloe was refusing to do any of her chores, and arguing about it with my wife. Charlotte jumped in and basically called Chloe lazy and said that she should be a better daughter like her. Apparently my wife got pissed off and told her off. She 'reminded' her that she was 'lucky' we were taking care of her and to stay out of it. From there it got bad.\n\nMy wife says that Charlotte was extremely rude about Chloe. But she also admits she told Charlotte that we 'didnt have to' take care of her, and that basically unlike Chloe, we can send her back to her parents if she keeps it up. Ignoring the fact we legally cannot, that's just completely fucked up. They ended their fight with Charlotte just going to my parents for that night, and she's been really upset and withdrawn since.\n\nWhen I got home my wife filled me in, and I was honestly pretty furious. The first thing that came to mind was 'what the fuck is wrong with you?'. Which admittedly wasn't a productive response but I was honestly just floored. The issue is that Charlotte doesn't get that a kid deserves unconditional love even if they're not perfect, so you fucking tell her that you'll kick her out if she doesn't behave? All the progress I worked with her for is gonna be shut back again. \n\nI was mad and we fought about it. I get she can be difficult, but that was inappropriate. However she's still refused to apologise or anything. I've tried to talk to her and explain that we love her, and that it wasn't meant the way it was said. But my wife is just accusing me of babying and favouring Charlotte. Apparently I'm being unreasonable thinking what she did was disgusting. That I should care more about Chloe, as if this is a competition. \n\nI am still honestly pretty pissed at her.

Your wife needs to apologize and looks like you're gonna have to have individual long talks with everyone", "NTA\n\nYou are correct here. It doesn't sound like you are favoring Charlotte at all. You aren't condoning or excusing her behavior. You issue is with how your wife dealt with the behavior, which I agree was completely inappropriate. \n\nYour wife (and you) ADOPTED the child. She is your child. She can't be given back. And threatening to return her to an abusive situation is basically abuse in and of itself. Your wife should never suggest such a thing and should be ashamed that those words came out of her mouth.", "NTA Wow. Your wife threatened to send your niece back to the parents that abused her if she didn't remember her place in your house.\n\nThat poor girl has been abused and was beginning to think she was safe in your home. All that hard work is gone.", "Nta - a correct response would be \"Charlotte, I'm the parent and will handle Chloe. Please apologize for calling her lazy and go hang out in your room while Chloe and I talk.\" \n\nYou need to talk with your wife. She obviously doesn't love Charlotte that much and even in the way you speak about the situation, \"all the progress *I* worked on with Charlotte\" implies that she's actually not that great of a caretaker and doesn't want her.", "NTA\n\nCharlotte has just been told that she is not loved and wanted. She was told that she will be sent back to her parents to live if she doesn't behave. You wife has single-handedly confirmed Charlotte's worst fears.\n\nKids squabble but your wife threw gasoline on a burning match.\n\nYou did the right thing in telling her off for undoing what you have been trying to fix with Charlotte. Honestly though, all of you need to be in therapy. Chloe because it sounds like she resents Charlotte. Your wife because it sound like she didn't want Charlotte. You because your dealing with the mess.", "NTA that was not just inappropriate but abusive! Your wife just emotionally abused a child who has already been abused and traumatized, I don't know you but I'm furious she deserves a hell of a lot better mother figure!!!", "NTA - IMO it seems that you wife really isn't happy that Charlotte is party of your immediate family now. IDK how much discussion you had with your wife or how reluctant she might have been but it doesn't seem to me that she's exactly open arms about the situation. Which totally sucks because Charlotte needs a loving family, not just one that doesn't abuse her. It seems that you are putting in all the work to make Charlotte feel loved but maybe the rest of the household isn't reciprocating that. \n\n>But my wife is just accusing me of babying and favouring Charlotte. Apparently I'm being unreasonable thinking what she did was disgusting. That I should care more about Chloe, as if this is a competition.\n\nIDK how your daughter feels about Charlotte, but it seems that you wife is jealous of her for your daughter. At minimum your wife should apologize for essentially saying \" you don't act how I want you to and we will send you back to your abusive parents\". Honestly if you can afford to you should probably look into family counseling.", "NTA\n\nI do think a discussion with your wife is warranted once heads have cooled a bit to stress the importance of being mindful of Charlotte's trauma and doing things like this can be counter-productive and make things worse long term.\n\nYour wife is not wrong to want to establish boundaries on how she parents her children just how she approached it in the moment did a lot more harm than good.\n\nShe likely hasn't apologized because she feels justified in that boundary but hasn't yet accepted there are better ways to establish them.", "NTA You need to explain to your wife that abuse is not just physical, it's emotional and mental as well. \n\nAnd telling a child that if they misbehave, they will be \"sent back\", IS ABUSIVE!!! \n\nI think family counseling may be good for all of you. \n\nBut your wife is 100% tAH", "Info: did your wife have any input on the process of adopting your niece, or was it a \"I'm doing it so you better get on board\" kind of thing?", "Instead of passing judgment I think you all need to get into family therapy pronto.", "Oof maybe show your wife this post and comments. She\u2019s defending herself after saying something so fucked up..that\u2019s really concerning. You guys adopted her, there is no sending Charlotte back. NTA.", "NTA. And I'm not sure that your wife wanted to adopt Charlotte as much as you did. She's being emotionally abusive to a child she knows was abused; that is beyond being an asshole, that's being a cruel monster. \n\nYes, Charlotte should not be allowed to lash out at Chloe whenever she gets triggered. She should not attack Chloe's character and get away with it just because of her traumatic childhood. But literally digging into her fresh wounds isn't remotely an appropriate way to correct her behavior, and that's exactly what your wife did. \n\nI can understand her not wanting to let Chloe feel bullied in her own home --and abused children can become bullies--, but she's completely out of line. She accuses you of favoring Charlotte, when what she did was to make a clear difference between the kids and tell Charlotte that she isn't her daughter and isn't entitled to the same kind of unconditional love Chloe is, so \"better watch it or I'll abandon you\". This could not only be a setback in Charlotte's emotional healing. It could very well be a catastrophic event that sends her deeper down the hole. \n\nWhat your wife did is what I'd consider unforgivable. But the only possible place to start repairing it is by apologizing to Charlotte. If she refuses, then you will have to face the ugly truth that you're married to an emotionally abusive woman and raising two young and impressionable girls under her influence. Which you shouldn't.", "NTA - poor girl. \n\nYou and your wife are definitely on different pages you have taken this girl and she is yours just like Chloe is yours. Your wife has accepted that Chloe is part of your family but doesn't sound like she has accepted she is equal to Chloe. Your wife apparently does not understand unconditional love either. Maybe family therapy is called for. \n\nThings can look fine but maybe there are issues you and your wife did not expect to come up and are hard to deal with.", "NTA\n\nIt would be helpful to have the ages of the children to get some additional context but I will give a verdict regardless. \n\nCharlotte is not your niece, she is effectively your daughter and should be treated equally to your own biological one. The initial comment your wife made makes it sound like you are only doing this as a favour to her and she expects obedience in return. This is just outrageous. \n\nIf your own daughter is not doing her chores here is the logical conclusion that Charlotte will come to. \"It doesn't matter if Chloe does her chores or not she will still be the favourite.\"\n\nYou are completely right in your point of view. Children can be difficult, with that information we shouldn't just threaten to send them back to an abusive household. \n\nThe only sticking point is the language you used for your wife in your initial reaction. I'd pencil that down to spur of the moment frustration so NTA for that.\n\n>She 'reminded' her that she was 'lucky' we were taking care of her and to stay out of it.\n\nOh how privileged Charlotte is being born into a mum and dad who don't care for them and having to be rescued by uncle and aunt. Ask your partner to check the definition of privileged.", "NTA\n\nYour wife was cruel. It\u2019s literally that easy to undo the work you are doing to make charlotte feel like she is part of the family.\n\nI mean, that\u2019s literally Disney villian level stuff, and that she doesn\u2019t get that is a red flag.\n\nSounds like your wife isn\u2019t as Ok with your niece being part of your family as she should be. You are not being unreasonable at all and clearly you two need to further discuss why she wants to \u201cother\u201d your niece so badly.", "NTA\n\nFully fucked up for your wife to say that. You sound like a great Dad and understand that both these girls are your responsibility and not going to be dragged into picking sides.\n\nI feel really bad for Charlotte as your wife has basically vocalised the insecurities she must have being adopted. Good luck with fixing this and hopefully your wife can apologise to Charlotte and try and repair this", "Okay, I\u2019m going to say ESH\n\nI feel like what your wife said is absolutely unacceptable, and Charlotte is absolutely owed an apology. And you should absolutely be pissed about it. \n\nHowever if this is what she said, I want to know how she felt about the adoption in the first place, because it looks like to me she wasn\u2019t one hundred percent on board and if she was \u201cforced\u201d into accepting it.\n\nEdit. I\u2019ve read your responses, specifically one that states you would have left your wife if she wasn\u2019t on board with the adoption, to me personally, it seems like your wife at least knew she had to accept this or you were leaving, and quite frankly, that isn\u2019t fair to her. I also get the sense that Charlotte is favoured over Chloe, again not fair. We\u2019re you all in therapy before the adoption took place? It\u2019s certainly needed now as it seems the resentment has reached a boiling point", "NTA!!! I would have responded the same way!!!! It\u2019s not babying and favoring when you are trying to teach a traumatized child to love and trust!!! Heck I\u2019d be p!ssed if my husband said something similar to our bio kids. If you\u2019ve adopted her they are both your daughters and should be treated as such. Unfortunately being fair isn\u2019t always equal and equal isn\u2019t always fair. Both girls (and your wife) need to learn this!!! The most important thing I can suggest is that your wife learns to apologize to the girls.", "NTA.  Well, your wife pretty much just confirmed every single one of Charlotte\u2019s trauma induced fears.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your wife is on board with adopting Charlotte and being a real mother to her.  Charlotte acted like a sibling to Chloe and told her to stop being a whiny brat, and your wife, rather than seeing that Chloe was being a whiny brat, or that Charlotte was acting like a normal older sister to call out the \u201cspoiled baby\u201d, told Charlotte that she was disposable if she stepped out of line.  She reinforced every fear and continued the abuse.  \n\nI\u2019d have a hard time forgiving this abuse of one of my vulnerable children from my spouse.  Particularly since your wife still doesn\u2019t see the problem.", "NTA, but you should try not to overreact to things. I think your niece was overstepping a bit, but I agree that what your wife said was hurtful. Everyone should apologize.", "You gotta make your wife a single mom in the future bro, the streets are gonna reclaim her\n\nNTA you are the hero", "ESH, it seems lile because of a rough past you're excusing Charlotte intentionally antagonizing Chloe. Your wife seems to have hit her limit of watching her daughter suffer because of someone else's kid.", "This might be the hill to stand on\u2026 that\u2019s really messed up, and your wife just set her therapy back - years.

Was she really 100% behind the decision to adopt your niece?  Because it almost sounds like she regrets it.", "That's exactly what I think.

I thought we were that before this. And given how upset Charlotte is, I'd say she did too.\n\nThe girls do generally get along. Chloe knows (age appropriate) about her parents, and that the issues aren't about her. And I definitely do what I can to make sure Chloe knows she's loved and all that. I don't think Chloe is jealous, so I would definitely say it's my wife's issue.", "Yeah what the wife did is very awful, the damage done their is going to take long to wear away. Awful way to treat a child that came out of an abusive family, and even worse that their new mom is now being emotionally abusive yet again.

What looks like normal teen squabbling to you is Charlotte lashing out because of her trauma (she was trained to be a good daughter or she would be abused) and Chloe more than likely resenting Charlotte for all the time and energy she feels you put into your relationship with Charlotte.\n\nYou may not have sprung this decision on your wife, but Carlotte's and Chloe's behaviors are putting pressure on her to deal with it. I do think that what she said was in the heat of the moment, but there is a kernel of truth there that she hasn't give voice too, so it made her say what she did.", "I\u2019m curious\u2026when you got custody and adopted\u2026have things been a lot harder than you guys anticipated? Also were you given any training on how to handle traumatized children? (I don\u2019t know if you went through the foster system or not where you live and what they offer.) I have spoken to adults who adopted through the system 10+ years ago where we live. There was no training for the parents. Because of this it caused a lot of issues as they didn\u2019t know how to care for the emotional and psychological needs of the child. I also know a family who adopted from an orphanage over seas. They had some training but it wasn\u2019t even close to what was needed so they knew what to expect. Because of that their child ended up going into a facility because they decided it wasn\u2019t a good place for the child or their family. (Child was making a lot of accusations of abuse against the parents and other children.)", "You might still have to make that decision. It seems like your wife is going to continuously reverse the effort and love you\u2019re trying to give charlotte, while putting chole on a pedestal you don\u2019t seem to see but are trying to battle. You\u2019re in a horribly difficult situation and I wish you all the luck. NTA.", "I read this part of your post as well, where you say Charlotte judges Chloe for not being \"grateful\" for her parents and her life. \n\nWhile I 100% agree with you that it is a toxic mindset for Charlotte to have (and one that stems from the abuse she was subjected to), you are very right in teaching her that it is wrong... I have to wonder if Chloe isn't actually acting more entitled, bratty, and \"ungrateful\" than you are aware of?\n\nI mean, given the fact your wife is so nonchalantly open about telling Charlotte she's lesser than Chloe and that she better learns her place, basically... it's not illogical to think she's creating a dynamic where Chloe feels superior and entitled to love and approval just because she's a bio daughter, and acting like it around Charlotte. \n\nThat still wouldn't make it right for Charlotte to attack Chloe, but it would definitely change the perspective over why she is so triggered.", "I'd say have a polite conversation with your partner. Help them see the error in the ways and come up with an idea that will actually make Charlotte feel part of the family. Maybe its time to get some family portraits done or something. \n\nContinue the therapy for Charlotte and try as cooperative parents come up with a chore schedule that both children have to adhere to. If they do not treat and punish them equally.\n\nCharlotte may not understand unconditional love but Chloe does seem very happy to exploit it it seems. Just a thought.", "As far as I know this is the first time it's come up like this. Charlotte definitely would have reacted obviously in the past. \n\nChloe and her do get along mostly. I definitely don't think Chloe is a problem, beyond being a typical teenager", "I know it's not been easy. But that's why she should apologise and try to fix it. The fact she stands by it, rather than seeing it as a heat of the moment mistake, is the issue.\n\nI've always tried to have the balance. Charlotte treats her a lot better now, and she generally treats Chloe well. \n\nThe kids are just smart arses and squabble like a lot of sibling, but at the end of the day they're relatively close. I'd say this was more a sibling being a pain, than Charlotte focussing on Chloe. She knows to butt out, and generally does, but like a lot of kids sometimes she says stuff about her sibling.", "Defend a grown-ass woman from a 12 year old who thinks she has to be perfect and obedient in order to be loved?", "Depends what you mean by defwnd I guess. Its not hardcore punishment, but I don't just let her act out. I definitely work with Chloe as well to make sure she knows we love her, and that Charlotte's outbursts aren't about her (because really, they aren't). \n\nThis wasn't some crazy insult though. It was just a petty sibling squabble, basically. While obviously I'd act, it wouldn't need some serious punishment.", "It definitely was hard. Why it wasn't a surprise per se, she was initially really difficult for my wife, since her mum had been the primary abuser. It took almost a year for her to stop entering her perfect-out-of-fear mode around my wife. We haven't had much from the state, but my parents help a lot with both girls where they can. \n\nI got a lot of advice from her therapists and everything though. Which helped a lot.", "I think Chloe is just a normal teenage girl. I wouldn't say she's spoilt. Sometimes she's lazy or thinks she knows best, but nothing more than I hear from other parent friends. The two girls do generally get along. They have sibling banter and can be a bit snarky to each other, but I really wouldn't describe it the way you do.", "We already have a chore system, and I'd say it's treated equally. Chloe was just being lazy and she didn't want to do them, that doesn't mean it's not equal or set.\n\nI genuinely don't understand, what did Chloe exploit? She literally did nothing. Unless you mean not joining in the argument is the issue, which I don't think is reasonable. Chloe doesn't mistreat Charlotte, it's mostly normal older sibling stuff.", "I hope so. But I find it difficult to believe your wife's attitude hasn't come out in subtle ways before. I am highly disappointed in your wife. It would have been bad enough with her initial behavior. But she has doubled down and says you are overreacting. Really? She clearly has little to no maternal feeling for Charlotte. Charlotte has now lost a second mother. I wish you and your family well. NTA.", "It\u2019s ONE of the issues, yes.  And I agree your wife owes an apology.\n\nBut it\u2019s clearly not been easy for anybody, your wife included.  She\u2019s apparently had a long time of being blanket-distrusted.\n\nThis could also open the door for a discussion about minding one\u2019s own business.  A conversation between your wife and Chloe does not need Charlotte\u2019s input.\n\nI know Charlotte is in therapy, but is anyone else in the family?  Seems it might be useful to get some tools to navigate these kinds of situations, so that everyone feels heard.", "I can\u2019t speak for everyone else but what I am getting from these comments is that you need to be certain that Chloe isn\u2019t manipulating the situation and using your wife to do this. It reminds me of recently divorced parents who don\u2019t realize for quite some time that their children are playing the parents against each other. It can be very subtle. What seems to be pointed out here is that Chloe may be very adept at using her status as the \u2018real\u2019 daughter with your wife and picking at her sister or refusing to do chores (which yea is typical teenager) but with the mindset of intentionally causing problems with Charlotte/you/your wife or any combination thereof to feed her emotional desire to be defended as the \u2018real\u2019 daughter. \n\nCharlotte needs to not step in to parent her sister but your wife needs to learn to handle that overstep and frustration better. I\u2019m concerned if she went off the handle the way she did over Charlotte butting in to a discussion with the other child. She was clearly upset with Chloe originally but there is no sign that her frustration here went nuclear yet when Charlotte commented something, which was actually positive towards your wife by the way, she went nuclear on Charlotte.

From one of your replies, it sounds like Charlotte has a particularly difficult relationship with the authority of motherly figures.

It's not some crazy out there scenario. \n\nPlus, either way, Charlotte would be in trouble for saying that. The ONLY reason I'm not focussing on that behaviour is because my wife's was horrific. Normally I would correct her and everyone would move on.", "So if she had of refused to help her, you think I should have what? Just not helped her?", "I think people just aren't reading fully tbh. I've repeatedly said I address the issues and there are consequences.\n\nAnyways saying differently is either bad faith or not reading.", "I dunno, man\u2014of course all families are different, but I can\u2019t remember my brother and I ever using any phraseology along the lines of who\u2019s the \u201cbetter kid.\u201d  \n\nIf the point is that Charlotte needs to learn that she\u2019ll always be loved unconditionally, surely she should be learning that applies to Chloe, too.  Even if there are times Chloe is lazy and doesn\u2019t want to do a chore, that doesn\u2019t make her a \u201cworse daughter.\u201d  It\u2019s not a competition.\n\nAnd given the fallout from this incident, maybe it is more serious a problem than you\u2019ve assumed?\n\nHow about family therapy with you and your wife?  Have either or you both of you talked to anyone about her feelings about being distrusted for years, and having her parenting policed by her kid?", "[removed]", "Did I say anywhere that you shouldn\u2019t have helped your niece? But the way you went about it is wrong! If after proper conversations and therapy it didn\u2019t work out you could have let your wife know that this is the end of the road for the both of you. Instead of handling it like an adult you issued ultimatums. Obviously your wife got on board because what were her options.", "I understand her history leads to more pointed phrasing. But it really wasn't designed to be cutting. I'm 99% sure it was just sibling banter, albeit expressed in a poorer way. \n\nAnd Chloe is unconditionally loved. I don't think she's a worse daughter. That's literally the message I'm trying to teach here? Like I've been working to make that patently clear and override my sister's programming. Again, I don't just ignore Charlottes comments, I'm not sure why your acting like I do.\n\nI don't do therapy with my wife. I do sometimes join Charlottes though.", "I think that\u2019s a bit extreme. His wife absolutely owes Charlotte an apology. However I think given his replies, Charlotte seems to be given the benefit of the doubt, it also seems the was a \u201cwe\u2019re adopting or I\u2019m leaving\u201d situation. The resentment has reached a boiling point and family therapy is needed if they hope to work this out.", "Understanding why she's doing something isn't the same as excusing it. Charlotte isn't doing it because she hates her, she was just jumping in with a smart arses comment. \n\n No kid acts perfect 24/7. The siblings usually get along but sometimes get snarky with each other. I always step in and work on it with them. But no parent is getting a kid acting perfect all the time.", "My fucking guy. I did the proper conversations. She said yes, so we didn't need therapy. You literally said to do exactly what I did.\n\n\n\nIgnoring thatz the rest of the argument if that it's wrong to leave my marriage if she refused to help my niece\n\nThe inherent subtext, is that I should choose my family over my niece. Which means I should be fine abandoning her.", "> I understand her history leads to more pointed phrasing. But it really wasn't designed to be cutting. I'm 99% sure it was just sibling banter, albeit expressed in a poorer way.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just sibling banter, not given the fallout.  Maybe your wife and Chloe are tired of being told which kid is \u201cbetter\u201d?\n\n> And Chloe is unconditionally loved. I don't think she's a worse daughter. \n\nRight\u2014Charlotte does.  And it\u2019s not for her to pass judgment like that.\n\n> I don't do therapy with my wife. I do sometimes join Charlottes though.\n\nSo your wife is the only one of the four of you who\u2019s never been able to work through the situation and her emotions with a therapist?", "[removed]", "In all honesty if you did have all the right conversations then this would probably wouldn\u2019t have happened. Your wife definitely holds some amount of resentment towards you and your niece.\n\nAlso I turn your question back to you, do you think it is ok to choose your niece over your wife and daughter (I am assuming they are whom you refer to as family)? I am pretty sure I already know the answer because you have been screaming it in all your responses. \n\nIf your intention is truly to solve this issue and come together as a family then please seek counseling for yourself and your family. And for once put down your weapons and talk to your wife without judging her or resenting her. Talk to her as a husband not a father.", "Idk how these people were raised but you did the absolute right thing with your niece. Your wife is a grown woman with a child of her own and she should think about her own baby if someone had to take care of Chloe. I\u2019m sure she would want someone to adopt her too. \n\nYour wife needs to teach your daughter compassion and start treating your niece better. And she also needs to realize, that If you had two daughters instead of your niece, the conversation would\u2019ve probably gone the same way. Sisters call each other ungrateful aholes all the time.", "I'm not neglecting Charlotte. I do parent her and talk to her. She gets along Charlotte most of the time. They don't have a bad relationship, and both can be smart arses. \n\nI agree. Charlotte shouldn't act like that. Which is why I've been actively working to teach her and why she's been in therapy. She isn't constantly saying this anymore, its relatively rare, but like i said she struggles with the idea of unconditional love.\n\nMy wife is more than capable of doing so. No one is stopping her. She didn't want to then. And doesn't now. That's not on me.", "How should I have approached my niece? Just let her be abused? There was no world I was going to abandon here.\n\nI did give my wife a choice. She knew I was going to fight for custody. It wasn't a surprise, and I didn't force her to do anything.\n\nFucks sake, there ARE consequences. I don't just let it happen. As I've repeatedly said. I just disagree with on the severity, because it is intended the way sibling banter is.", "That makes no sense. You literally have not described doing anything differently, beyond just not belong my niece. I literally had everything you suggested in my approach.\n\nYet despite literally having your described approach, I'm abusive? \n\nAnd again, divroce isn't abandoning my daughter. Yes I would divorce over this. If she is not willing we are incompatible. I would raise both my niece and my daughter."]}
