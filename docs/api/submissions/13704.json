But report his harassment to amazon, THEN block him.", "NTA.\nA review is a reflection of your experience with a product. And all things considered a bad review is getting of lightly for the seller. A refund for a faulty product was a gesture of good will but if it entails removing the review then it is a bribe. The seller is the AH for spamming you and selling a faulty product.", "NTA. I'd keep the honest review on the product but add seller refunded so no issues with them.", "NTA in any way- that's tantamount to harassment", "NTA. A refund doesn't change the fact that you experienced physical suffering due to his lack of due diligence regarding the product he was selling.", "NTA. The product has thousands of reviews bc often the seller with refund your money for a glowing review. I bought a Bluetooth speaker. It was a $30 speaker and sounded like it, except the reviews were glowing. The seller reached out and offered to refund my $$ if I gave a glowing 5 star review. I didn\u2019t do it but now I know never to buy things that have thousands of glowing reviews", "NTA.\n\nIt caused you physical pain which is already a no-no, the fact you had to get treatment compounds. \n\nI'd have blocked him after the first email asking me to change the review, ngl.\n\nAll of the reasons you made that review are still valid, so don't bother changing your review, people gotta know if their Adult Toys are going to burn the shit out of them before they Insert them.", "NTA.  Ouch.", "NTA. A friend had a similar problem and they eventually began sending correspondence to her home. Report to Amazon.", "NTA - the product is defective and a refund is the absolute minimum the seller should be doing. If anything they should also be covering any medical costs.\n\nThe review needs to stay as is so that other users can be aware of the dangers of using the product.\n\nThe purpose of a review is to show your experience. Just because the seller says they fixed the issue doesn't mean they actually fixed the issue. And the seller can always respond to your review themselves saying they fixed the issue.\n\nAs long as you're not lying, everything you've done is perfectly fine.", "Definitely NTA. He is stalking you and you have every right to block him. One person is not causing him any financial duress like he\u2019s claiming, and the honest review should stay up IMO. You got seriously hurt and others should be aware that the product may not be safe.", "NTA. Your review is valid. It\u2019s better to share your experiences than not. The seller should swallow the blemish and move on.", "NTA. Seller is harrassing you and the refund shouldn't change the review, reviews are supposed to be there to warn people about potential issues with the product.", "Lmao I never got emailed by a seller that begs me to change reviews / talks about his family / moan. NTA", "NTA if it continues threaten to get your friends to review bomb it. They'll quickly stop", "NTA", "NTA, but the seller handled it well and refunded you. You should update your review and said they had great customer service and refunded you.", "YTA. \n\nTypically when you write a review when the issue gets refunded or fixed, you edit it to mention the intial problem and add that the seller repaired it or something to show they are aware and likely working on bettering it. \n\nTo just ghost them is an AH move.", "YTA. You don't have to delete or change what you said originally, but it's only fair to update it to tell the full story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
