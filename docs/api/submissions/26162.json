They always favored my sister over me because she was way more talented. In dance, the arts, etc.  The month I turned 18, they kicked me out and didn't care that I was living in hotels for a while, never once helped me but paid to put my sister (F23)  through college and never charged her rent or anything. She still lives at home rent free. She is into using a lot of luxurios and expensive products because she makes a lot of money. I was never given the opportunity to go to college. I'm established now and have sort of forgiven them. They live two hours away so when I come to stay, I stay a few days. It has never been an issue of me using the items in the shower before, today. \n         I got in the shower, and just used the body wash that was in the shower. Not a ridiculous amount, like literally a nickel sized amount. It was the only body soap in the whole shower. I get out and go about my business. 10 minutes later, she storms in to the guest room and goes \"did you use my Chanel body wash???\" I said \"if it was the one in the shower, then yes, why?\" And she lost it. \"That's a $100 body wash I never said you could use that! What the hell is wrong with you?? You seriously think you can just come in and take over like that?\" I said I was sorry, I didn't have any idea it would be an issue as the last time I was here there wasn't a problem ith me using stuff. Then she came out with \"what? Let me guess, you were too broke to go get a dollar bar of soap from dollar tree? So you think you can just use my expensive stuff? You could never.\" And I got angry and told her if it was going to be that big of an issue I would have just got my own and no need to bring up Financials that it's literally soap. She told me I needed to buy her an entire new bottle of it to replace the tiny amount I used or else don't bother talking to her or coming back. I told her she was being ridiculous. Mom got involved, and said I should have asked and maybe having to buy her another one will teach me to ask next time. They know good and well I can't afford $100 bottle of body wash. I told them they were being ridiculous and if that's how it's going to be I just won't come back. My sister said \"good, could use that time to make money instead of being a poor ass broke bitch and taking other people's things.\" I just left after that. I work 12 hour shifts 5 days a week for a manufacturing plant and they know that I'm not just lazy, but life has kicked up expenses lately. My mom texted me later saying maybe I could get her the smaller size one and apologize again. I told her no way was I going to pay even $60 for the smaller size, that the way I was talked to and treated was insane. Not got anything from either of them since. Really heartbroken by this, my sister has said hurtful things in the past but never like this over something insignificant. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for refusing to buy my sister body wash?", "created_utc": 1693775470, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1698gm8/aita_for_refusing_to_buy_my_sister_body_wash/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is absolutely no reason to try and keep a relationship with your abusers. Block them and let them go.", "NTA. I suggest doing that thing where you never speak to them again.", "In my experience with narcissists, this isn\u2019t about the soap. This is about picking a fight so they can justify breaking up with you again. The best thing you can do for yourself is instill the boundaries you need to protect yourself.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

You could have asked, sure, but if you have done this before then I can see why you wouldn\u2019t have felt obligated to. \nYou don\u2019t need to buy her anything as an apology.

There is no need to defend yourself against such nonsensical attacks.

To the point where my children noticed it even though I've never said a word about the situation to anyone ever.

She overreacted yes, go non contact since they don't support you anyway.", "It's Chanel body-wash.  You know you shouldn't have used it.  I bet there was other body-wash.  It's very expensive.  It would be too much to replace it but maybe offer to buy her a coffee sometimes to smooth the situation over and apologize.  Yes she does sound selfish but it was still her stuff and using it created unnecessary drama.\n\nIt sounds like the larger problem is that you feel like she is the favorite in the family and that your parents have not supported you.  If your parents put her through college and never charged her rent but didn't do the same for you, then your feelings are valid.  She can probably afford Chanel products because your parents have been generous with her.  My sibling has always been the favorite in my family so I know how painful that kind of thing is.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is that you need to keep your focus on the actual problem.  Apologize for the body-wash.  You do have a more serious problem with the favoritism.  Don't do anything that will allow people to deflect from that.  Have you talked to your parents about this unfairness?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
