So I \\[32Male\\] am a very new to this, my second year working.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 \\[27M\\] and I needed to take a vacation from our work to hang out with each other more, as he's a doctor and I'm a surgeon barely do we have any time at all. Okay, so we both filed for vacation, mine had to take a little while until they found another orthopedic.\n\nMy section head and the CEO then accepted my request. Great, anyway, as I was still around in the country, I got a call from my section head that they have a few patients and the locum hasn't turned up to the shift yet so they need me as soon as possible.\n\nApparently, the patients are all young adults who have been hiking and broke their legs in the level of (ligament crois\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur, patellla and fracture au niveau de col f\u00e9moral) (sorry French because I'm not bothering with searching these terms in English) which is leaving them in a pretty mild case of pain, and I told him I wished I could go but I can't because I already started drinking so they need for the night shift orthopedic to come, until then they should just mend them with what's available or direct them to another hospital or center (surgeons like me are very rare here)\n\nHe was surprised that I started drinking, I'm a surgeon who's in a vacation and the laws of the place state that it's dangerous for me to start drinking while in work, he said that even if I'm in a vacation that doesn't matter since a surgeon is a surgeon and they might need me any second so I can't just be reckless about this. I told him that I'm in a vacation, he approved it and I don't care. He went wild at this calling me an asshole for contributing to this dilemma, and I ended the call.\n\nLater on, my fianc\u00e9 thought more about it and maybe I should have been very careful of drinking this early, but still, these are my days off, it's official. Why does it matter? I'm not working.\n\nAITA?\n\nedit: my agreement does say absolutely nothing about this. Just that I shouldn't drink while being available/working\n\nOh and that I have to be sober 2 weeks or so before I return/begin work, but that's still far enough.\n\nanother edit: 2 weeks of sobriety is just to build a habit really, many doctors here only have a few days or a week to be sober and it's enough and since it's far riskier to be a drunk surgeon then a week or so should be perfect for me, they are very careful about it here.", "created_utc": 1683307838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138vkl0/aita_for_drinking_when_im_a_surgeon/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like they knew in advance you wouldn't be going away anywhere and would still be staying local, so decided to treat you as an extra for an emergency, rather than being on actual vacation.

He asked them what they would have done if he had already started drinking and they basically gave him the same speech you got about it being reckless and trying to criminalize him over it. He did end up going in though, and it was a good thing he did. The girl he saw had gotten hit in the head with a baseball and if she had to wait any longer for specialized treatment she would have gone blind or deaf (can\u2019t remember which one).
