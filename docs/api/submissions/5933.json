Did one of you lose one and y\u2019all haven\u2019t gotten around to replacing it yet?\n\nYour bf is clearly T A \u2014 unless there are missing reasons here. Such as, this kind of thing happens frequently and has impacted him before, and he finally decided that you get to deal with the consequences of your behavior. If this was a first, he\u2019s T A. If not, Y T A.\n\nI say this as someone recently diagnosed ADHD (much later in life than usual). I am habitually late to things and often forget or misplace things. I can make a HUGE effort to not be late or not forget something, but it\u2019s not sustainable. \n\nI do have some accommodative behaviors I\u2019ve managed to develop with great pain and effort over the decades to do things like not lose my keys (I DO NOT step out of my door without my keys in my hand or pocket, and they live either in my pocket or in their one spot in my room, NEVER being put down anywhere else.) It feels stupidly easy or inflexible, but it\u2019s literally taken me years to grind this habit into my head to OCD level, where it disturbs me if I consider putting my keys down somewhere else. Because I *know* if I skip \u201cjust once\u201d, the damned habit may break and I\u2019m back to square one of losing my keys or locking myself out again.\n\nAnother common problem ADHD folks have is we tend to have a shame spiral constantly on replay in our heads. We know our superego isn\u2019t fully in charge of what we do; we know we tend to run late, get distracted easily / be impulsive / lose track of time / forget things. \n\nAnd it is *exhausting* constantly trying to corral our toddler brains to *please be normal! Pay attention! Be on time! Don\u2019t lose this important thing!* So we feel like we put in so much more effort to get half the results normal people do, only to be called lazy or uncaring. And our toddler brain just giggles and runs after the next shiny thing while the adult part of the brain sits and stews in the pain and exhaustion.\n\nI say this because I wonder if this is what\u2019s happening here. I know the sound of the excuses we tend to make to try to hide our failures to cope with things neurotypicals find easy or just a bit of effort. We don\u2019t feel like we have control and yet get blamed for the fails and told how *easy* it should be to be normal. So we try to spin things as more acceptable things out of our control.\n\nThe problem is, that still affects other people, and we are responsible when we do things that impact others, toddler brain or no. It\u2019s our responsibility to find coping mechanisms that make us functional; to seek out diagnosis and therapy and/or medication to treat the issue. And it\u2019s our responsibility to appreciate other people who help and apologize to others who are hurt by our toddler brains.\n\nYes, it would have been kind of him to give you the additional help to help you overcome a) your not having your key; b) your forgetting this fact; and c) your lack of planning to handle this on your return (you know you have her the key when you left \u2014 you should have set up plans then, when you knew the upcoming problem. Toddler brain, I know, but still, your responsibility). But *it is not his responsibility to cover for you*.\n\n\u2026but it\u2019s so much easier to get mad at him for not doing the extra for you, than to shame spiral on yourself about forgetting something *again*.\n\nIf this was the first time he\u2019s been impacted by this \u2014 yeah, he\u2019s T A for not putting in that bit of extra effort to cover your mistakes, under such harsh circumstances. But I suspect he\u2019s covered for you before. \n\nAnd honestly, this is the best way to deal with us. He didn\u2019t shame you or blame you, which just makes us spiral more, and either get terribly depressed (turning it inwards) or angry (turning it outwards). He just quietly refused to let your self-inflicted problem impact him.\n\nIt would have been *kind* of him to. And as a boyfriend, you expect him to be kind. But how kind have you been to him \u2014 given that I suspect that this is not atypical?\n\nOf course if I am totally misreading this and you are never late and never forget things and always keep up with all your details, and this was a first-ever event, then yeah he\u2019s a jerk. (And I envy you terribly.) Though it might bear asking if he dated someone like this before you\u2026.\n\n(Should I also mention another common hallmark of ADHD is long posts? Lol)", "YTA.
