Now if he had another appointment, ok, but he didn't so this is really kinda strange. NTA.", "NTA. He is lazy and useless", "You misspelled \u2019ex-boyfriend\u2019. \n\nPerhaps understandable if he had other places to be, but he waited there for your return?\n\nNTA", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t value you and is willing to try and guilt trip you into getting his way.  You should reevaluate the relationship.", "NTA.\n\nNothing he did says that he actually cares about you.  It's funny that he thinks cleaning his own place of living is a sign of affection.  Something he did for you.  In reality he doesn't respect you and has something else on his mind.  He sounds very immature and has a lot of growing up to do.  \n\nI recommend leaving him because I promise you someone else will treat you so much better and will be with you because they actually want to be.  This should have been something to laugh about together instead he wanted to be an AH.", "He actually wasted an extra hour and a half sitting in the car while she took a bus rather than drive his exhausted girlfriend for half an hour?! I think she misspelled ex-boyfriend.", "https://www.thestranger.com/savage-love/2018/02/20/25837088/savage-love-letter-of-the-day-dtmfa-dtmfa-dtmfa\n\n... you're an AH to yourself if you stay with him. Good luck!", "I thought that was weird too? Like if he had other things going on that he would have been late for I maybe could have understood not being able to take her.\n\nWhen my gf and I drove back from a trip (three and a half hour car ride one way not including breaks) she realised she left her laptop and work ipad behind. I immediately offered to split the drive round trip, because to me that's what you do for the people you love. Mistakes happen. And this one didn't seem to really be that much effort to help out with", "I can\u2019t wrap my head around his logic. I mean is that the way you\u2019re supposed to  be in love with?\n\nNTA", "He was probably scrolling reddit.  Hope he sees this!  NTA", "Very illogical, especially when you factor in that driving would have cut it down to half an hour. He sat there for 3 times as long as necessary.\n\nAnd thats *before* factoring in that OP wasn't dressed for the weather, was exhausted from 20 hours of travelling and had barely eaten in 10 hours.\n\nIn BFs position, I'd have driven OP there, stopped along the way to get her some food (even if just a small snack) **and** had her stay in the car while **I** went and fetched the key from the roommate.\n\nBecause that's what someone who cares about their partner would do in that situation.", "He wanted sex lol.", "10000000% narcissist red flag, and when you get upset, the issue will switch to how valid your reactions really are versus the actual thing you\u2019re upset about - tread carefully, OP!", "Didn\u2019t even realize this until you made the point and you\u2019re 10000% correct. This is narc grooming. Ugh.", "I would also like to point out that just a few weeks after I broke up with my high school sweetheart, he picked me up from the airport, got me food, and drove me home so my mom could sleep for work.  \n\nThis man doesn't deserve to speak to her again", "Fucking IS the benefit, smh.", "It just kept getting worse with every sentence!!", "Found the boyfriend", "You sound exhausting", "All which he should be doing regularly anyway...", "So why are YOU doing that in HIS house.", ">Don\u2019t know why this is being downvoted\n\nIf you use your noodle a little harder you can probably figure out reasons why it's being downvoted. You may not agree with them but you should still be able to see why.", "I will say that cleaning when my mom with allergies comes over is a different animal compared to my non allergy riddled friends come over. One involves pulling up all the area rugs and washing them, washing the covers for couch cushions, basically if it is a textile in the lower level of my house it has to get washed the day my mom comes over every time she comes over. We aren\u2019t just talking regular vacuuming and dusting.", "Oh we all know what guys do in cars at night alone.  Not to worry.", "Damn I just made the same comment elsewhere in this thread, missed yours. I very much agree this has got to be the BF!", "Risking his well being by driving in the rain? If he can't handle driving a mile and half in the rain , he should give up his license", "Never said he couldn't handle it. Driving, especially in inclement weather, is statistically one of the most dangerous things you can do. Doesn't even matter if you're a good driver, because you can't control the other drivers on the road.\n\nBut I was asked what he lost by driving her, and I pointed out three downsides of doing so."]}
