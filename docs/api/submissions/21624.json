There are also bustier types and honestly thousands of different variations and styles. And it's not actually ceremonial dress. It's just a style or category of clothing. There are tons of types and styles, they can be very formal and worn by brides, or casual enough to be worn for smart occasions by little kids. Tons of types and designs and different styles of choli (tops). Jacket style lehengas (which different than ones that are paired with crop tops though you could see the same lehenga skirt type paired with both) have been super hot recently for example. Crop top blouse ones are always classic and a particular type of one is even referenced in this list : https://blog.mirraw.com/2019/03/27/8-different-types-of-lehenga-choli-styles/amp/#JacketStyleLehenga\n\n\nOp should wear whatever style she wants for sure (it might also be coordinated - like when cousins get married for various functions all of the grooms sisters and cousins sisters may be gifted the same outfit in various colors to wear, at the actual wedding ceremony there's color coordination - for us the right turban color becomes particularly important, you get orders of style/material/stiffness/length preferred by the men and they all get one in the color for their side) . But in case anyone else is wondering (because maybe you're like me and would never in a million years be comfy wearing a midriff baring choli though totally fine doing it for a saree huh what a weird hang up on my part lol) if you want a top with more coverage those are totally normal and common too even with young women and girls !", "Thank you.
