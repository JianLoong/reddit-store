Bravo to cousin!", "NTA. You didn't tell your cousin to uninvite your mom. She did that all on her own. Probably because she *is* disgusted by your mom fat shaming you. Mom has nobody to blame but herself. \n\nDo you live at home or on your own. Because you seriously need to stay away from your mom's negativity. Even if you were thin, I'd bet she would find something else to knock your self esteem down.", "NTA if the cousin wants you over the mom that\u2019s their choice abojt deciding what guest they want at their special day the most. the cousin could have said ok well i want your mom there bc of xyz", "NTA, your mothers attitude got her uninvited, not you.", "NTA. Your mom got herself unvited, not you.", "You are NTA\nYour mom on the hand is.", "YTA. You are almost 30 years old and can\u2019t stand up for yourself, so you tattled on your mother and got someone else to do it for you.

You should never have called your cousin and gotten her involved in this.", "YTA - why dont you call up your cousin and say it was a misunderstanding. Tell your mom what you're wearing and that she'll have to live with it.\n\nGetting your mother uninvited to a family wedding is overkill. What exactly would you plan on telling people when they ask where your mom is? This story? \n\nGrow up and fix it. You're 28 years old.", "YTA. you're an adult right? either tell your mom that it's none of her business how your body looks or if you feel that it would be too much either pick a different outfit or don't attend. it's a big no-no to stress out the bride/groom about your attire on their wedding day", "YTA for making a big drama out of this. If you don't like the way your stomach looks, do something about it instead of screaming fatphobia at your mother. You would just ignore her if you were happy with your body. Your body, your choice what to feed it.", "YTA seriously? Grow up. Wear what you want - want to wear a choli? Go for it, who cares what your mom says about your body? Or if you don\u2019t, there are endless styles of other Indian outfits available. You can even get them custom made online. This was all completely unnecessary.", "YTA because you need to grow up and own your body. And tell your mom to leave you alone. You're almost 30. STAND UP.", "YTA. This is between you and your mom, not your cousin. If you truly don\u2019t feel like going due to your mother\u2019s potential comments, why not either ignore her or where something else?", "YTA because you assumed your mother would make a big deal of the crop top.\n\nYou may be correct. You did get her uninvited based on an assumption though.", "yta", "YTA. Did they dress code say crop tops are mandatory?

When I was typing my reply I had accidentally swiped to a different post. But OP is still a grown adult and needs to act it.", "A vague term to get the cousin to reinvite her mom to the wedding which causes the least amount of drama.", "Honestly we actually do use crop top / Indian crop top to talk about a particular type of lehenga top in English often. There are also bustier types and honestly thousands of different variations and styles. And it's not actually ceremonial dress. It's just a style or category of clothing. There are tons of types and styles, they can be very formal and worn by brides, or casual enough to be worn for smart occasions by little kids. Tons of types and designs and different styles of choli (tops). Jacket style lehengas (which different than ones that are paired with crop tops though you could see the same lehenga skirt type paired with both) have been super hot recently for example. Crop top blouse ones are always classic and a particular type of one is even referenced in this list : https://blog.mirraw.com/2019/03/27/8-different-types-of-lehenga-choli-styles/amp/#JacketStyleLehenga\n\n\nOp should wear whatever style she wants for sure (it might also be coordinated - like when cousins get married for various functions all of the grooms sisters and cousins sisters may be gifted the same outfit in various colors to wear, at the actual wedding ceremony there's color coordination - for us the right turban color becomes particularly important, you get orders of style/material/stiffness/length preferred by the men and they all get one in the color for their side) . But in case anyone else is wondering (because maybe you're like me and would never in a million years be comfy wearing a midriff baring choli though totally fine doing it for a saree huh what a weird hang up on my part lol) if you want a top with more coverage those are totally normal and common too even with young women and girls !", "Thank you.  It was so ignorant of OP, but somehow given her immaturity, I\u2019m not surprised", " OP did. She expressed her concern about attending based on her experience with her mother. From the  conversation between OP and cousin,  cousin made a decision and uninvited mom. Sounds like cousin has more knowledge than we do and chooses to support her cousin.", "Seems like the cousin understood pretty clearly that mom does not like seeing OPs stomach exposed in traditional attire.  This is body shaming.  Cousin supported OP and uninvited fat-phobic mother.  What\u2019s the misunderstanding?", "I think the misunderstanding is you misunderstanding my position on this one.
