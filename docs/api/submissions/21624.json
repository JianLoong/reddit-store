There are also bustier types and honestly thousands of different variations and styles. And it's not actually ceremonial dress. It's just a style or category of clothing. There are tons of types and styles, they can be very formal and worn by brides, or casual enough to be worn for smart occasions by little kids. Tons of types and designs and different styles of choli (tops). Jacket style lehengas (which different than ones that are paired with crop tops though you could see the same lehenga skirt type paired with both) have been super hot recently for example. Crop top blouse ones are always classic and a particular type of one is even referenced in this list : https://blog.mirraw.com/2019/03/27/8-different-types-of-lehenga-choli-styles/amp/#JacketStyleLehenga\n\n\nOp should wear whatever style she wants for sure (it might also be coordinated - like when cousins get married for various functions all of the grooms sisters and cousins sisters may be gifted the same outfit in various colors to wear, at the actual wedding ceremony there's color coordination - for us the right turban color becomes particularly important, you get orders of style/material/stiffness/length preferred by the men and they all get one in the color for their side) . But in case anyone else is wondering (because maybe you're like me and would never in a million years be comfy wearing a midriff baring choli though totally fine doing it for a saree huh what a weird hang up on my part lol) if you want a top with more coverage those are totally normal and common too even with young women and girls !", "Thank you.

As a fat Indian girl myself lemme tell you, all fast aunties here expose their fat bellies while wearing sarees. Nobody cares about bellies. \n\nAlso there are multiple things you can wear to an indian wedding like saree, salwar suit, indian gowns etc. Also those tops need to be crop tops.", "OP, NTA. Your cousin is a lovely person for not wanting you to suffer.", "NTA. Also, there are some traditional Indian outfits and clothing that cover the belly completely.

Why is people so hellbent on making other peoples lives miserable and then get all offended, when someone doesn\u2019t take their bull? *eye roll* \n\nYour mom got herself uninvited for being a judgmental human being. Others bodies is not her concern. No matter who they are or if she birthed them. \n\nYou go to that wedding and you wear the pretty outfit and you keep your head high and have a wonderful time. You deserve to have fun and be included. Don\u2019t ever let anyone make you feel otherwise.

There have been studies correlating formula fed babies and adult weight gain. Thanks Mum! Well done your cousin!

Loudly, and only a few feet away.", ">can you imagine what OP's mom is gonna say to the other women who have bellies and wearing that beautiful attire??\n\nAbsolutely nothing. People who bully their children are often cowards who wouldn't pick on someone their own size, so they take it out on those beneath them on the food chain.", "I can\u2019t imagine my mom pulling this shit on me. It\u2019s not your fault, she\u2019s just not the nicest person.\n\nYou should feel so happy and proud that your siblings and in-laws are willing to go to such measures to make sure that you are also comfortable on their day.\n\nYou are important to them, and they want you there.

My mother used to bodyshame one of my friends in 2nd grade.... we were 7 or 8 years old. I'm sure she or my dad have also said something rude to my overweight ex.

The only reason she's \"eased up\" is because I was pregnant or nursing. I lost all my baby weight after weaning, looked good for my cousins wedding, and subsequently got pregnant \ud83e\udd23. Also, I prefer saris now since my boob size fluctuate so much and they just happen to be more forgiving. \n\nMy husband was talking to me about my son's neck creases and how they're so deep. I have had the same neck creases my entire life. My mom shamed me at a wedding in front of her sister for gaining so much weight after pointing out those neck creases. I cried the whole wedding, I felt awful for not being able to keep it together. Of course my mom doesn't recall any of it. The brother of the bride called out the parents for being homophobic and not acknowledging his parents and son in the speech. So yeah...good times.", "Nope,  wear anything Indian with confidence that most Indians looking at you are seeing it as cultural appreciation and not cultural appropriation.  There will always be some who are offended but just ignore the noise. We as a culture have always believed in adopting the best of whatever we come across, and welcome both fusion and interpretation. \n\nThe one line that might trigger many people would be using religious symbols or images  disrespectfully like on underwear or footwear etc. But that aside,  you're welcome to experiment.", "Only Americans think everything is cultural appropriation.

Take plenty of photos to remember the day with your gorgeous family and be thankful your mothers not there to spoil your day!\n\nAlso, ignore the YTA posts, I'm sure you're close to your cousin and she chose you over your mother.

Secondly, i said it is mostly worn by youngsters since it's more stylish, but fashion is all about how you carry yourself right, so women of all ages look lavish in that outfit if it suits them. My bad, if my comments came out as ageist or classist, didn't mean it.", "I understand you can't avoid be hurt by your mother's comments, but you are also 28 years old, and you should be able to go through with your choice, in that case wear that bikini.  \n  This said, I find your behaviour child like, and I don't trust you convey the whole picture. You said yourself, you gained weight. There is a difference between wearing a clothing after 2 or 5 or 15 kgrs gained. And your mom might be aiming at you getting a bikini which would correspond to your new size, fit you, and make you  look gorgeous, rather than putting on an ill fitted swimming suit.YTA", "NTA OP.  Your cousin did not like your mother's behaviour then did the best interests of everyone involved in the wedding as guests & bridal team by uninviting your mother who has a disgraceful attitude towards anyone who is little extra wide in the girth & not want your mother being a disgraceful AH by mouthing off to whomever had that extra width in the girth & not wanting your mother to ruin the wedding for everyone.", "NTA. Mom should learn to be kind", "NTA. And I really like how your cousin reacted.\n\nHope you will enjoy the wedding and have lots of fun.", "INFO \n\nWould you be required to wear traditional Indian dress?

That's between her and cousin.  And your mom is hella toxic", "NTA I think your mum being uninvited is hilarious and well deserved. Your cousin\u2019s a legend. Hope you all have a great time at the wedding and your mother can suck it.", "You didn't make your cousin do anything. Your cousin is horrified by how your mother treats you. As she should be.\n\nI hope you have a lovely time at the wedding. Your cousin is a lovely woman.\n\nNTA", "I absolutely love that your cousin wasted no time at all in obliterating a threat to your peace and happiness.  At her wedding.  That\u2019s a woman who loves you, cherishes your relationship, and wants you to be present for one of the biggest days of her life.  And somewhere in all of that, she needs to ensure she can share her wedding day with you, because not having you there will make it less than perfect for her.  \n\nIf you two weren\u2019t already best friends, I bet you are well on your way.  Wear that cropped too with pride and know you will look amazing.  \n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA.  Your mom though\u2026 maybe your cousin can give a TED talk on setting boundaries and invite everyone your mom knows.  I\u2019m pretty sure your mom has a tendency to tear everyone down when the opportunity presents itself.  I\u2019m even more sure everyone around her could benefit from learning how your cousin shut her down faster than your momma can give a side eye or a snarky jab.", "NTA and kudos to your cousin for just removing that negativity from the entire event! \n\nI\u2019m still dealing with the aftermath of my step mom body shaming me for so long. What helps me is realizing that my body is the least interesting thing about me. Love yourself girlie. Be thankful for your body. Wear the crop tops and enjoy the wedding!!", "Incorrect, she spoke to her cousin about the attire and her concerns, then her mother came up. The bride made a sensible decision based on that information that likely saved her and her wedding from issues on the day. OP did her a solid by warning her.", "Probably nothing because people like this are sweet as pie to the general public and use their children as punching bags when no one is looking.", "Yep. Big ol' NTA. Classic case of \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\"", "I agree with you. I was wondering why u/ThreeKos said there was a misunderstanding.", "Mother did it herself. Tell your dear cousin for me that she didn't just do you a favor, she did everyone at the wedding a favor: keeping mom from ruining a special occasion with her body-shaming judgmental behavior.", ">but at worst?\n\nAt worst what? She bodyshames an auntie and gets her ass handed to her. I'm pretty sure the guest list isn't exclusively 2nd graders.

Saree: unstitched looooong cloth. Lehenga choli: full length skirt & blouse.\n\nAnd that's just from north India. We have many types of saree or skirt- blouses from the other states. Assam: mekhola  Sikkim: Bakhu South India: pattu pavdai etc. In many states even older women wear them.\n\nOP NTA but time to stop being near that body shaming mommy.", "just saying, Indian Americans think it's cultural appropriation and have an issue because they're the ones who got bullied and harassed for it. The folks from India chiming in have never had their mom get yelled at by a stranger in a grocery store. Especially in the 90s and 00s things were really rough. Like after 9/11? people were awful. \n\n\nFWIW, Indo-western is an entire category of clothing and the most appropriate way to do this. I would encourage you to look for South Asian designers, and think about how to incorporate skirts, scarves, tunics and similar items into your everyday wardrobe. Western silhouettes with South Asian prints. etc. \n\nIt's usually different when you're invited to a South Asian event. If you want to do it in everyday life without connection to the culture, I really recommend the above approach."]}
