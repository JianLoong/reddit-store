There are also bustier types and honestly thousands of different variations and styles. And it's not actually ceremonial dress. It's just a style or category of clothing. There are tons of types and styles, they can be very formal and worn by brides, or casual enough to be worn for smart occasions by little kids. Tons of types and designs and different styles of choli (tops). Jacket style lehengas (which different than ones that are paired with crop tops though you could see the same lehenga skirt type paired with both) have been super hot recently for example. Crop top blouse ones are always classic and a particular type of one is even referenced in this list : https://blog.mirraw.com/2019/03/27/8-different-types-of-lehenga-choli-styles/amp/#JacketStyleLehenga\n\n\nOp should wear whatever style she wants for sure (it might also be coordinated - like when cousins get married for various functions all of the grooms sisters and cousins sisters may be gifted the same outfit in various colors to wear, at the actual wedding ceremony there's color coordination - for us the right turban color becomes particularly important, you get orders of style/material/stiffness/length preferred by the men and they all get one in the color for their side) . But in case anyone else is wondering (because maybe you're like me and would never in a million years be comfy wearing a midriff baring choli though totally fine doing it for a saree huh what a weird hang up on my part lol) if you want a top with more coverage those are totally normal and common too even with young women and girls !", "Thank you.

Nobody likes to witness that kind of thing at what is supposed to be a happy occasion. Or anywhere, really.\n\nWomen of all shapes and sizes wear lengha choli and saris, it's not limited to supermodels. Saris do have a piece of fabric that goes around your waist, so it does provide a little cover. \n\nThis is only if you yourself are uncomfortable. If you are getting fitted for this, see if you can talk to the seamstress about some more cover, making the shirt a little longer, and the skirt maybe a bit higher? You might be able to wear a shalwar kameez (w is pronounced as v) It's a long tunic and pants combo, with a scarf (dupatta) Not a form fitting outfit and they have beautiful designs, often with sequins and hand beaded. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy guess is the cousin wants her bridal side to match outfits, which is the norm for weddings.

And you can always wrap the scarf to hide your belly if you want. At the last Indian wedding I was at a lot of women had one piece dresses on so no belly to hide at all.", "Wear what you want, just please be mindful of where you purchase it from.

I mean, I don't judge weight much at all but of features that would make me say \"Oh X is overweight\" those neck creases are not even close to part of the list.

(Not that I'm gonna give up my overalls though, I've almost got them broken in enough. I love overalls, they are the superior choice for most situations calling for jeans.) I'm mostly joking, but not 100% because there are some absolutely beautiful styles out there and I love color so much but am phobic about wearing it. (Which has nothing to do with race, I'm just a wimp.)\n\nOh, and some foam sole flip flops. Can't forget those, they are vital to my people.
