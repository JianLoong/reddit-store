Plus they sound like a pack of buzz kills for any party.", "NTA\n\nThey clearly didn't like your wife and would have not celebrated the love your two share. If they weren't happy about the Marriage, why would they be happy about this?\n\nOut of curiosity, what tattoos does your wife have? I've been looking for ideas.", "NTA for not wanting to invite them, but I do think the right thing to do would be to actually communicate to them that they weren't invited prior to it happening, and explaining why. Just as a common courtesy to your family. \n\nI also think that you not inviting them is only going to make them dislike Tori more. They won't be able to get to know her for who she really is if you don't invite them to big life events like this one. \n\nGranted, it is your party and you get to decide who comes. All I'm saying is, I can understand why they were hurt by this. \n\nAlso, even if tattoos are a no-go and she likes to drink, she shouldn't have to hide those things. Even if they do think she's ditzy and wild, they have to accept that's who your wife is no matter what. Instead of excluding your family, you could just stick up for her and instead of distancing overall. That's just my opinion.", "NTA\n\nAnd your family fails to realize that nobody cares what they are wearing if it is nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nI could not even tell what my husband is wearing right now although I saw him the whole day.\n\nI once hat a chat with a lovely lady and when I later talked to my daughter she claimed this lady I talked with had an arm missing. \n\nI didn't notice it!\n\nWe are so occupied by ourselves we hardly notice other people.", "NTA.  They are concerned more with how they look to the group _not_ being there.  They don't actually care about her (or you), as evidenced by their main concerned about the invite and now wishing you well.", "NTA- your family seems like some shallow ass people.", "NTA - Damn, I LOVE it when a husband stands up for his wife against his family. It\u2019s an amazing thing to see. \n\nKeep loving & supporting your wife. The hell with your zombie family, except for brother. No wonder you\u2019re with your wife-not a zombie. I hope you have years & years of happiness & laughter.", "NTA. not sure why they'd expect to be invited to celebrate a marriage that they don't typically celebrate, and it's good that you set that boundary so your wife wouldn't feel put down at her own celebration. though it might be good to communicate to your family why you made that decision to give them a chance to rectify the situation, assuming that you haven't already, because if they truly don't like your wife then they're only going to use this as a way to justify their preconceived notions of her", "NTA - The only way you could have improved this is by not making it about them not liking her and instead talking about the culture you want for your home. For example, you could have said \u201cYou weren\u2019t invited because my wife and I wanted a fun atmosphere at the party and you weren\u2019t very lively at our wedding\u201d. This highlights that you and your wife are on the same team, that you agree with her life mentality and that your family will have to adjust.", "NTA.  They didn\u2019t think your marriage was worth anything.  So why should they be allowed to join you in your celebration.", "NTA. You're a good husband.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t liked the wedding so you assumed they wouldn\u2019t be interested in any event celebrating it. \n\nAsk them if their tight asses would wish to get involved with your future kids too because, you know, you don\u2019t want to inconvenience them.", "NAH - to be honest, I dont think theres enough info here. You obviously should only invite people who you want to your party.\n\nThis is likely something that should have been addressed sooner and/or more specifically and I cant blame your family for being a little pissed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good on you for standing up to your family for not respecting your wife and your marriage.", "NTA. Your family needs to learn that you are a package deal at this point. I would not allow my family to come to an event I\u2019m hosting, and ignore my spouse the entire time. I also wouldn\u2019t be going to family functions at their houses anymore. Not liking someone\u2019s spouse is fine, pretending like they don\u2019t exist on holidays and on their wedding day is not. Respect goes both ways, and it sounds like you gave your family time to prove themselves. The blood of the covenant is thicker than water of the womb.", "YTA    You said you explained why they weren\u2019t invited which is good, however YTA by not giving them another chance to act differently.", "We get invited, then they give her the cold shoulder", "a heart on her wrist, a rose on her shoulder, and \"Bella vita\" on her arm in cursive", "Happy to provide any other info you need", "It\u2019s been a year. It\u2019s safe to say ( and OP has in comments ) that there have been other opportunities. They give his wife the cold shoulder. You don\u2019t get to ice someone out and still be expected to be invited to their events", "Also to add. At the wedding: Your parents and sister were acting respectful. They didn\u2019t make a scene or anything. Have you actually directly asked your parents and sister how they feel about your wife or are you assuming?  Why don\u2019t you have a chat before taking suck a drastic step .", "Oh well, no use in accepting an invitation from them again. \n\nNTA!", "cool", "Well has there been things that have actually happened? \n\nSo far all youve mentioned is them being a little wrapped up in appearances. Like I said, your party, invite who you want but unless theres been other situations that have come up or its been addressed already with them I can very much see them being pissed and cant blame them.", "When I got married my family gave my spouse and I time alone to enjoy the \u201choneymoon\u201d or new marriage glow. Gave us space so I am seeing it differently.", "Sounds like since the wedding, the rest of the family was disregarding his wife, so I can see why he didn't invite them.  But, OP needs to have a candid followup conversation with them to understand what their issues are with her.  Tell them that they need to take the initiative to develop a relationship with her.  Example:  invite OP & wife to lunch or something, and start building from there.  See how much effort they put into it.", "We went to my parents' for Christmas Eve last year. Tori had a little more to drink than the rest of us and blurted out that she felt we'd served our time and asked if we could go home. She tried apologizing but I don't think it helped", "So wait, your wife was drunk and rude at your parents?", "she was tipsy and after hours of nobody really acknowledging her, yeah, she let it slip that she wanted to go home.", "This sub loves to exclude in-laws from events but I really dont think this was the right step to help improve everyone\u2019s relationship. Doesnt make you an AH though.", "NTA. Cold shouldering is done on purpose to make her feel excluded without saying it. They can't possibly be loud about their snobbery, it would ruin their carefully crafted image. Just like they see your wife as doing."]}
