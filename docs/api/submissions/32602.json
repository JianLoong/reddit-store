For a little back story, when we met, he was my next door neighbor and I worked in a gentleman\u2019s club and was working on my degree holistic medicine.  When we got together, I quit working as I was finishing my last few months toward my degree and everything was going smoothly.  I have been working in my field for the last 8 1/2 years consistently in my own private practice and haven\u2019t looked back on my old life.  Fast forward, he has been working his job for over a year and this is the first time he has been invited to a corporate Christmas party that was not during business hours and we were both excited to go.  The day before the party, I told him I had taken off from work so I could go shopping for a Christmas dress so I could dress appropriately since mostly these days all I ever wear is scrubs.  He told me that he was worried about someone recognizing me from my old life and that it would embarrass him if someone did and that if they did, he would have to quit his job because he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle people talking behind his back about how he was married to an ex-stripper.  As this comment offended me, I took in what he said and I told him that if he is that concerned about someone recognizing me from my old life then maybe it would be best if I didn\u2019t go to save him the possible embarrassment.  He told me that I was being selfish and I should have thought about what I was doing back then and what consequences would have come about in the future.  I suppose he is right in this regard because I don\u2019t talk about it but never did I think it would come back to haunt me later.

What am I missing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I should have thought about what I was doing back then and what consequences would have come about in the future.\n\nUm, what? He's blaming *you* for your past that he was fully aware of before he married you? If your being a former dancer was going to embarrass him, he shouldn't have married you.\n\nNTA", "So he's blaming you for WORKING at a strip club but not holding the other people \"responsible\" for GOING to the strip club.\n\nNTA", "Nta so before you married this old jerk you were suppose to think well years from now I may marry an old jerk so I better not do something that would embarrass the old jerkthat I haven't met yet. Sounds nuts doesn't it.", "So it's OK if one his colleagues frequents strip clubs to such an extent that they'd recognise someone 9 years later but it's embarrassing if they then point that out to your husband? And that's your fault? What nonsense, he knew about your old life when you got married, he can't keep throwing it back in your face. NTA", "NTA\n\nWe don\u2019t have time travel. You can\u2019t change the past. Plus, he thought you were good enough to marry. Now he has an issue?", "NTA.\n\nSo a 43 year old got involved with a 28 year old stripper, who by job definition was hot, and married her.\n\nNow he wants to shame her 9 years later, for being what she was when he got involved with her (reminder, a **hot** stripper).\n\nHe is a massive hypocrite and can get bent.\n\nYou got your degree and your successful career, and he wants to put you down.\n\nTwo card him, marriage counsellor or divorce lawyer,  and never let **anyone** make you feel bad about your old, very legal, way of paying your bills.", "Tell your husband to pick a side: either love and support you for who you were then and who you are today; OR resent you (and himself) and blow up this relationship. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf he brings it up again, tell him that you looked up his company's officers and it turns out one or two of them were indeed your best clients, so now you would like to go to the party after all; you want to show them what a prize you married and they hired.", "Either he wants you to go to his wretched little holiday party-or he doesn\u2019t. He can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nAnd nine years ago when you worked your previous job, I bet you looked a lot different. Even if you look the same, lots of people have a doppelg\u00e4nger. Surely his work colleagues would assume that is the case.\n\nSo. Your \u201cpast\u201d is only worrying your husband -*now*? Is this change in your solidly middle aged husband due to a mini stroke? Perhaps you should encourage him to go to the doctor for an evaluation. \n\nNTA And at this point, I wouldn\u2019t go to that party unless he grovels. Or hell  freezes over.", "NTA - It didn\u2019t bother him when he dated and then married you, why should it bother him now?", "No respect from husband. This is not right.\n\nA beautiful young girl using her assets to get her education is NOTHING to be ashamed of.  You were smart.\n\nYour husband needs to rethink his stance. Just awful.", "NTA, of course you don't want to go with your husband on pins and needles about the possibility that HE will be made fun of if you are recognized. Gotta love the double standard here. It would be okay for men he knows to have gone to the gentlemen's club to gawk at women, but not okay for you to have worked there? Yeah, well, he's a dolt who shoulda thought about how fragile his pride is before he married you. My husband would love it if I had been a stripper at one point in my life, and he'd have laughed in the face of anyone who tried to embarrass him over it.", "NTA\n\nHe knew what he was getting into when he got involved with yoi.\n\nAnd seriously - 8 years later??  Who t.f. remembers some random stripper 8 years later??\n\nHubby is a pretentious prick...  and hes lucky you didnt walk the minute he opened his mouth...", "NTA. Ooooh. No . \nHe wants to shame you. That is a GIANT RED FLAG. \ud83d\udea9 \n\nAsk him what the  point of that passive aggressive conversation was if he ultimately wanted you to go? Press him for an answer. \n\nWas he weaponizing shame?\n\n\u201cShame suppresses, contracts, limits and weakens the person who is shamed.

You can\u2019t erase the past and there\u2019s no shame in stripping.\n\nYou can\u2019t win here and I would maybe seek some couples counselling.", "Um what is really going on here.\n\nIs he having an affair/flirtation at work?\n\nBecause this doesn't make any sense. Is this the first time this has been an issue for him?\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI mean, I'm impressed he kept himself completely 'pure' until the age of 43, and that no-one besides you has ever seen him in a state of undress or rhythmically moving to the beat of music.", "NTA \n\nHe made you aware of his concerns to which the obvious solution would be to simply not go and avoid the issue altogether, therefore he should understand when you now refuse to go. As much as it might be fair to raise the point that you could have thought about your actions back then, he too should have thought about and considered these things when you were together, if he knew that it was an issue for him, then choosing to stay with you in essence insinuates that he can put up with these concerns and should not care. You have moved on and this should no longer be an issue", "NTA. I would ask him to explain why he is worried about this now and not when he married you. Did he not not the consequences of his actions when he married you? He is a complete hypocrite to worry about someone recognizing you when he was ok with marrying you. Why is your previous work embarrassing when being a customer there wouldn't be?", "NTA. Obviously. Your husband trying to put \"blame\" on you is rich. It was his choice to marry someone who worked at a gentleman's club; maybe HE should have thought about the consequences of his actions?\n\nThis is his hangup, not yours. I would say he's the AH for being so immature about this.", "He married a much younger woman who had the physique and physical stamina to be a stripper and now blames you that he MIGHT get embarrassed? Because his co-workers might have *checks notes* gone to a strip club 9 years ago?\n... Do you think they actually looked at your face enough to remember it today? (Nothing against your face, I just think they looked elsewhere)\n\nNTA he's a misogynistic ass", "Bruh, I would rather tell them that you used to strip than tell them you studied holistic medicine and are some kind of pseudo science quack.\n\nIt's way less embarrassing that you used to strip.", "YTA if you stay married to this man !!  \nWTH he is now suddenly worried someone might recognize you from your club days? Honestly, if anyone did they probably wouldn\u2019t mention it because they wouldn\u2019t want the whole office to know they went to the club.  \nAnyhoo. No. He has no right to say that and to denigrate your past when he has seemed fine with it all these years.  What a dang hypocrite he is.  \nNTA to not go to the party. But you need to rethink this marriage. Sorry.", "NTA. He told you not to go then is mad you\u2019re not going. It sounds like your husband sucks to be honest. He knew your past and is now deciding to hold it against you like he is morally superior.", "So... he's embarassed that you used to work at a gentlemen's club.  But he had no problem being a customer at that club.\n\nThe man is an ass, and a hypocrite.  Don't go to the party, and you might want to reconsider staying with him at all if he still feels that what you did was so wrong... but what he did was totally ok.", "NTA, but your husband is.\n\nFirst, the chance that anyone would recognize you - and then have the gall to say anything - is somewhat remote.\n\nSecond, your history hasn't changed since your marriage.  If this worried him, he should have considered it prior to the marriage (or taking this job).\n\nGet a great party dress go and enjoy.\n\nI'd be a lot more worried about your hubs over-indulging at the bar and saying something stupid than I would someone recognizing you.\n\nHere's another news flash - the internet existed 9 years ago.  Do a bit of a google search and see if your photo shows up anywhere.  If there was any advertisement or photos taken, they are out there.  If he can't get over this and move on, maybe he needs to explore setting up his new family.", "NTA it feels like he's got double standards and is gaslighting you a bit", "Your husband is a complete asshole", "Nta. Bring up something that he did previously that no one would notice about and throw that in his face.", "NTA - The irony is you not going is the natural consequence of his own words. Also, as \"harsh\" as it may sound, you working at a gentleman's club isn't exactly special since there are many people that do it to fund their education. He's being judgemental for you doing what you needed to do to make ends meet and also upset that you won't do what he wants you to do because you are acting (appropriately) on his words plus adding in a side of guilt with the whole \"I'd have to quit my job\" dramatics. I wouldn't want to go to the party either.", "Solve his worries completely.  Divorce his ass.", "NTA\n\nTell him \"Oh honey, nobody remembers my face from the strip club. They were all too busy looking at DAT ASS!!!\" (or, THESE TITTIES, ymmv)", "Nta", "NTA. He married you knowing your previous job. He should\u2019ve thought about THAT before making that decision. He doesn\u2019t get to hold your previous occupation over your head for the rest of his life. He can either be confident in the reasons he chose you and loves you, or move on. I\u2019d go to that party and have the time of my damn life. If someone recognizes you\u2026it\u2019s because they went to strip clubs. Congrats on your career and success. It\u2019s amazing and I hope you\u2019re proud of where you are and where you came from.", "NTA! Time to divorce. When will he tell you to stay home because one of your patients may recognize you from before?\n\nThis is a him problem.", "He is delusional, how can he bring that up and then be mad at you for not going? What is the alternative? I mean, what are the odds someone is actually going to recognize you from 8 years ago...he is being ridiculous. And how is this the first time this is coming up? Is he not worried about his friends or family? Why is he more worried about coworkers then anyone else?\n\nNTA but he sure is", "The only \u201cyou should have thought\u201d valid here is why the hell you thought marrying the kind of guy who says \u201cyou\u2019re selfish for working a tough job to raise money for education and career advancement because you should have known you might marry *me* and I could possibly in the future be embarrassed because you once worked in a stigmatized job\u201d was a good idea. WTF is wrong with him?\n\nNTA and seriously take a close look at how he treats you.", "NTA. No, this is not OK. There is nothing wrong with your old life. There is nothing wrong with what you did to make money to put yourself through school. He has no right to be embarrassed by you. If he\u2019s going to continue to talk to you like that tell you that you were selfish and should\u2019ve thought about that back then maybe you need to rethink this relationship.", "So he is concerned someone might recognize you? What about the fact if they recognize you...they were AT THE CLUB? \n\nAlso the fact he can't be proud of his hot, doctor, bad ass wife? \n\nDump.", "NTA \n\n\nHe knew you were a stripper. \n\n\nHe's 15 years older than you. He got together with you when you were in your 20s and a stripper. Now you're in your late 30s and wear scrubs. Not as interesting to him. \n\n\nAnyone who would recognize you would do because they went to a strip club. Not only went, but was enough of a regular to recognize a specific stripper from 8 years ago while fully dressed. AND the person would have to be willing to admit this. But, obviously, that type of guy is completely fine to him. \n\n\n\nWhat consequences? That you'd marry a jerk who'd judge you a decade later, having known and acted okay with your previous job?", "So he\u2019s allowed to go to a gentleman\u2019s club, and so are his coworkers, but if you work at one, thats shameful and embarrassing. Jesus. He\u2019s a f\u2019in hypocrite. Wear it proud. You made your money. No shame in that. \n\nThe problem is, he told you what he thinks of you truly. Please, listen to him.", "what the actual fuck?", "NTA. No one will recognize you. I was an artist\u2019s model for a while. People I encountered outside would think I looked familiar but never recognized me with my clothes on. This is because, when I was modelling, I was not a person but an object. While strippers are definitely people, I imagine that the audience didn\u2019t really see them as such. The dissonance between what you did then and who you are now is unlikely to be bridged by anyone at that, or any, party.", "Nta.  What does your husband bring to the table?  Why are you staying with someone that is disrespecting you and implying that you are an embarrassment to them?", "What about him? Was he not simping for a stripper when he started dating you and then supporting you while you finished school? Why didn\u2019t *he* think of the future when he decided to marry you? Maybe he\u2019s lying at work, wants to wit or has a side piece and is trying to hide it from you while blaming you. It\u2019s been nearly a decade. I hardly think anyone will remember you in the sea of tits and ass they\u2019ve consumed in the years since. Your spouse is \u2026 special.", "NTA he should have thought twice then before getting into a relationship with a stripper. He knew the potential consequences of that. He\u2019s gross to try to pin his issues on you.", "Nta if they recognize you, then that means *they* went to gentlemen clubs, and that's on them.", "Info; what was his solution? It seems to me that he was specifically asking you not to go, so I\u2019m not sure why he is mad you offered not to go? Did he want you to go but wear a paper bag over your head? Does he want you to go back in time and not work as a stripper?\n\nIf he had a problem with dating a stripper, he never should have dated a stripper. Your past is a part of you and it\u2019s nothing anyone should be ashamed of. If anything it\u2019s the MEN who might recognize you who should be ashamed.", "NTA- you are allowed to support yourself.\n\nI don't get see him getting upset that his co-workers might have gone to a strip club.  \n\nYou know how he feels about it now.  I'm sure it's a little late in your relationship for communicating these concerns.\n\nYou need to have an in-depth to talk.", "NTA but it sounds like he's told people at his work, and now wants to hide that by making you not go (and possibly find out). Maybe a coworker mentioned the club, and he replied, \"my wife used to work there\". But he can't take that statement back.\n\nOtherwise, of course NTA. I don't know why he is calling you selfish or somehow saying you should have not worked in the club. WTF. As another commenter said, you were good enough to marry.", "wow. if he was concerned he shouldn\u2019t have married you. he\u2019s an ass. NTA.", "NTA. He is such a hypocrite. He had no problem marrying a stripper, but you should be ashamed that you were a stripper, because *now* it is a problem for him?", "NTA, but he is, why would he marry you if he had those concerns in the first place? And so what if people talk behind his back? Tell him to grow up.", "NTA.  Your husband is the AH here.  Your job was a decent job, made a wage that allowed you to get a degree and a job in the future.  He is ashamed of you, which translates into a lack of respect for you. I wonder how many times he has said something about your previous life that you ignored...this is not good.", "Clearly the only logical solution is for you to jump in your Time Machine and go back and change the past so your husband doesn\u2019t have to quit his job over something that may never happen based on a past he was fully aware of when he married you. Sound ridiculous? Yeah it is! How much time are these men spending in \u201cgentlemen clubs\u201d if they remember a stripper from years ago when they were drunk? Your husband is an idiot. You\u2019re NTA but you married one.", "It sounds like he made a poor decision, and his tool made that decision for him. He's at fault here, he knew, but didn't think ahead.", "NTA. Can't change the past, and he shouldn't have gotten together with you if he thought there was even a chance he'd be ashamed of you. I hope that you don't think you have anything to be ashamed of.", "NTA. \n\nYour former life is your former life. When you marry, you accept someone, warts and all.", "You should ditch the grandpa tbh", "NTA, and sounds like you have major husband problems. If he can\u2019t accept your past, he can\u2019t accept you. Double standards are huge here!", "Your husband should\u2019ve thought about the consequences of that before he married you. He\u2019s a hypocrite and you should just you know, put on your best stripper heels and a short dress, and go to the party.", "NTA its the \"hot stripper girlfriend paradox\".  Dudes are all excited about the idea of a hot stripper girlfriend, until they get one, then absolutely freak out about all the implications.   Fuck that noise.", "I'm 59f, dang what a lucky jerk he is. He should be proud of you sweetie. You deserve better. NTA", "in case you were wondering what he really thinks of your \"old life,\" now you know. \n\nthis \"man\" does not value you. he values his image ONLY.\n\nget away from him. he's gross.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your husband sounds self centered and didn't behave in a way appropriate for a partner. No job is shameful, we're all just trying to survive out there and it's nobody's business what you did to make it through. Shame on him for being a bad partner who disregards his partners feelings. Good luck.", "Ew. NTA.\n\nThis is so shamey that it makes me very uncomfortable. He's shaming you for a job you had, WHEN YOU MET HIM, that he was totally accepting of. Now he wants to shame you for it? Nah. That's gross. Period. If he's embarrassed, why didn't HE think of that when he agreed to \"date a stripper\" if he's so upset by it.  Flip it right back around on him. \n\nYou paid your way through school, you did it with a skill you have. It the words of the immortal Adam Sandler, \"WHOOPITY DOO!\".\n\nI am so disappointed by his actions. I'm sorry, OP. You deserved better than that judgement. You did a job, it doesn't matter what it was because it was your job with your body and your mind and soul. It involves 0% of others decisions because it was you, not him. 100% of the decision to date you was on him. 100% of living with you was him. You did nothing wrong but live your life how you saw fit. Who can shame someone for that?", "I'd tell him that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future as I walked out the door!", "\u201cI should have thought about what I was doing back then and the consequences it might have in the future.\u201d This is projection. What he means is HE should have thought about what it would mean to HIM to marry a former stripper. These are all HIM problems. NTA but not your husband sure is.", "NTA. So your husband was in his 40s and married/dated a stripper in her 20s and he\u2019s concerned that nearly a decade later someone from his work will recognize his fully clothed wife from an encounter at a strip club that would have happened at least 8 years prior? \n\nIt seems to me he should have thought of the possible consequences of marrying someone he\u2019s ashamed of. He can sugar coat it all he wants. Your husband has just told you that he\u2019s ashamed of you and your past and he would be so mortified if you were outed as a stripper that he would have to quit his job so as to not look at anyone who knew he married you. You are married to a man who is not proud to have you at his side. Do what that information what you will.", "NTA, and you two need to sit down and have a serious talk about why he's ashamed of you, and whether or not you want to continue the relationship knowing that he considers you to be a dirty secret.", "Why isn\u2019t the onus on him to have considered the consequences of dating a dancer? I don\u2019t see how your actions are involved. It *hasn\u2019t* come back to haunt you, but his personal discomfort has come back to haunt him. This isn\u2019t on you at all. NTA.", "I will preface this by saying I have never understood the stigma against people who work in the adult entertainment industry. As long as it is their choice to get into it and/or they are consenting, there should not be any issues. Everyone says \"they are selling their bodies\" but are people who work retail not doing the same thing? Their body is being paid to be at that store and to do certain actions, the adult entertainer is just being paid for different ones. Sure, theirs are more revealing but if they are willing and compensated it should not be an issue. I am very much oversimplifying but the point is, you have no reason to be ashamed or embarrassed of your past OP. \n\nYou worked a job that ensured you had a roof over your head, food to eat and were able to get what I am assuming is your dream job. If he is ashamed of that, it's on him, not on you. He knew what your job was before you got together and if he had an issue with it, he should have raised it then. It's not okay to suddenly punish you for your past or hold it over your head. \n\nPersonally I highly doubt anyone would recognize you, it's been 8 or 9 years. Even if they did, for them to say comment about it, they would need to admit to going to the Gentleman's Club often enough to recognize you. In order to remember someone from that long ago, they would need to have been a regular. I kind of doubt many would want to admit that just to talk behind someone's back. \n\nYou are NOT being selfish, if anything you are being selfless. Not only did you take time off to ensure you were dressed appropriately, making him look good, you also offered to not attend to avoid HIS embarrassment. As for saying you should have thought of the consequences in the future, you did and have left it in the past. You aren't broadcasting your past job and it is working because you have had 8 1/2 years of steady employment. He is an adult and chose to enter this relationship freely, it's on him to think of the consequences of making that choice. It's not up to you to think of every possible scenario of the future for every person in your life. You made him aware of your career at the time, if he cannot or does not think through the possibilities of what could happen that is on him. Again, he is an adult and is responsible for his own choices and the consequences of them. Unless you hid it from him and he is making an uninformed choice, it is his responsibility, not yours.\n\nNTA but your husband definitely is and you deserve better. He should be proud of you and all you have accomplished. \n\nSorry for the long rant. I wish you all the best OP and hope you treat yourself to something while your husband attends that party alone.", "NTA\n\nYou will never be good enough for him\n\nFind a man who is proud to be seen in public with you and who won\u2019t care if someone else thinks you look like a stripper they used to see, someone who will look another man dead in the eye and say, \u201cthat\u2019s great you consider my wife to be so attractive\u201d and then, of the man persists, says, \u201cit is weirder that you went to strip clubs than if she worked at one, don\u2019t you think? You threw away your money on women who would never give you the time of day in any other context, are you saying they should be ashamed for taking your money?\u201d (He doesn\u2019t have to confirm your work history to defend it).", "Man, you know how many college students work at strip clubs because they got to pay the .......wait for it...... STUDENT LOANS!!\n\nYour husband should have understand that by now!\n\nNTA! 100%", "NTA and please do not let your partner ever use a past that he was fully aware of to shame you or make you feel bad.

He is the one who has suddenly a problem with it ? Why now ?\n\nHe painted you in a corner. No matter what you do now, you are the bad one ! It's not ok OP. It's borderline abusive.\n\nHe made the counscious decision to live with the consequences the day he said yes.\n\nAnd how come it's embarrassing to have been a stripper but it wouldn't be embarrassing to have been in a stripclub ?

For a little back story, when we met, he was my next door neighbor and I worked in a gentleman\u2019s club and was working on my degree holistic medicine.  When we got together, I quit working as I was finishing my last few months toward my degree and everything was going smoothly.  I have been working in my field for the last 8 1/2 years consistently in my own private practice and haven\u2019t looked back on my old life.  Fast forward, he has been working his job for over a year and this is the first time he has been invited to a corporate Christmas party that was not during business hours and we were both excited to go.  The day before the party, I told him I had taken off from work so I could go shopping for a Christmas dress so I could dress appropriately since mostly these days all I ever wear is scrubs.  He told me that he was worried about someone recognizing me from my old life and that it would embarrass him if someone did and that if they did, he would have to quit his job because he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle people talking behind his back about how he was married to an ex-stripper.  As this comment offended me, I took in what he said and I told him that if he is that concerned about someone recognizing me from my old life then maybe it would be best if I didn\u2019t go to save him the possible embarrassment.  He told me that I was being selfish and I should have thought about what I was doing back then and what consequences would have come about in the future.  I suppose he is right in this regard because I don\u2019t talk about it but never did I think it would come back to haunt me later.

I understand that you have to do what you have to do to make ends meet but the club life has a way of sucking you in.  I stayed in for 7 years when I was only supposed to be there long enough to help catch up the bills and get ahead and look for another job.

He refuses to give up his beliefs despite having his wife, the woman he loves tell him what it's really like. Not only that, he clearly cannot handle you ever having worked there because he keeps bringing it up every now and then.  To me, it sounds like he is holding it against you and does not respect you at all. If you aren't talking about it, he is the one who refuses to leave it where you left it, in the past. \n\nIt would be one thing if he found that once you were together he wasn't as okay with you being in that industry as he thought. Thinking about being in a situation is different than being in it. Talking to you about it without the ultimatum should have been the appropriate response. Instead he gave you an ultimatum and is still punishing you years later despite you choosing him. \n\nPlease don't let his attitude affect how you feel about it. You have nothing to be ashamed of and if anything, you should be proud. You earned your degree and career all on your own by working hard.

He's being extremely unfair to you as he knew exactly who you were when he married you.  He has no business holding your past life over your head.

I don't know enough about it. I only did a google search and got the \"mind, body, spirit\" thing, so commented based on that. \n\nMy neighbour, on the other hand is a naturopathic doctor. While she means well, a lot of the stuff she tells me seems very 'out there' and quackery. Maybe some things she does works, but I don't trust her just based on the other things she says. An example: her friend died \"from cancer treatments\" (not the cancer itself), but yet another died because of \"untreated diabetes\"; so sometimes modern medicine is okay, and sometimes it's not? Plus she pushes chiropractors, which could be beneficial to some people, but in my personal experience were literally rushing people through their office, doing the same crack-crack, NEXT! to each patient, not actually trying to fix the issue at hand, and were very cult-like in trying to get patients to recruit more patients.

I haven't even thought of that !", "Yeah. I'm pretty sure that anyone who recognized her wouldn't say a thing about it. If you told someone you remembered a stripper you saw a decade ago, you're admitting that you used to visit that strip club all the fucking time. No way you'd remember what a stripper looked like if you'd only seen her once or twice.", "Exactly my thinking.

If holistic \"medicine\" regards a person's health from every perspective, someone who practices holistic medicine needs to have studied traditional medicine among other things, right? Otherwise their view is not informed \"completely\". They need to have all the available knowledge. So how come holistic practitioners can call themselves that without having studied traditional medicine?", "Trying to wrap my head around that as well. Barring OP using her real name as her stage name, no one is going to recognize her. Pretty sure every dancer I have ever seen had enough makeup, hair coloring/wigs/styling and dressing styles that in no way would I recognize them at a company functions years later. In fact, all OP would need to do is go with straight forward makeup and maybe some hair coloring/styling that in no shape or form would match look from dancer days.\n\nUnless of course hubby might have been bragging off about stripper wife to some work folk and now worries about getting busted.", "Right?!! Kinda creepy if you remember a dancer from that long ago!", "And IF you saw her, you would certainly NOT mention it.", ">but I doubt I would recognize a stripper I saw at a club 9 years ago if I saw them at an office Christmas party.\n\nAs long as she keeps her top on there is very little chance of her being recognized by any past patrons...", "That was my thought as well!!", "True.  They're not usually looking at the face anyway.  Now, if she went tits out somebody might.  But NTA.", "This was the vibe I got tbh", "I think this is the answer", "Exactly!

You called her a \u201ccommodified object for men\u201d. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine ever calling another woman that.
