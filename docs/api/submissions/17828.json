Excluding his gf is not going to end well for you.\n\n'I said I wasn't comfortable inviting his gf since we don't know her'\n\nSo invite her and get to know her. Is it your party or your son's party?", "Info: I am so confused. Why doesn\u2019t your son want you to ask questions about her? Why didn\u2019t she sit with you at the grad ceremony - were there not enough seats, or did she sit with friends, or did she sit somewhere else alone? Why didn\u2019t she talk to you at the dinner? What was the context for her saying she had a college degree so often?", "YTA.  Keep this up and your son won't have much to do with you.\n\nYou have no excuse for not adding one more person to the party.\n\nMy approach to my kids' boyfriend/girlfriend is to do everything I can to get along and get to know them because in the end,  kids choose their BF/GF over their parents 99% of the time.\n\nIt's his party and he wants her there.  I suggest you put all your bad feelings behind you and start fresh with the GF.  You'll be the one to lose.  Your son is an adult and will choose his own partner.", "I think YTA because your son wants his gf to be included so it's an AH move to not try to make it happen. You had a bad first impression of her obviously but you can use this party to get to know her better. You don't have to accommodate her, she's your son's guest. Let him handle it if he wants her there.", "YTA\u2026 it\u2019s his gf\u2026why would you not invite her.  That\u2019s weird and you might want to look at your behaviors (and your daughters) as to why this gf clearly doesn\u2019t feel very comfortable around your family.", "YTA\n\nLet the GF come. You are picking a fight that will have no winner if you get your way. And it's one extra person, that won't throw the plans out the window. \n\nYou can also put some of this on your son to manage. How the GF gets to/from the airport, where she stays (since it cant be at your house) is all something those two can sort out. They're adults.\n\nAnd really at the end of it, if it's his party, he should have more say in who is invited. You not liking the GF after the first meeting doesn't factor in. This could actually be an opportunity to get to know her a little bit.", "YTA... its his GF, his grad party. Sure u can invite her but he is responsible for gettibg her accomodations. U be polite and nice to her.\nYou may not like her but she is HIS choice so respect that. I dont like my sons current choice but I am always polite and accomodating as its his choice.", "YTA. You can't throw a party for someone and not invite their significant other!", "YTA. It\u2019s a party for him apparently but you\u2019re making it about you. He wants her there", "YTA\n\nI'd invite his gf as a surprise just to start off in a good place. You never know but she could end up being your dil. She's his choice not yours. Who's it going to hurt to invite his girlfriend?", "I might get down voted, but I'm thinking ESH.\n\nIt seems to me like YOU DID try to get to know her the first time you met, but SHE'S the one who's insisting on remaining distant.\n\nShe and your son don't want you or your family asking questions. Why? I get being shy, but you're not even allowed to ask your son questions about her in passing? She made absolutely no attempt to interact with her boyfriend's family when you first met. \n\nShe doesn't seem to want anyone to know anything about her and she doesn't seem to want to get to know any of you, either.\n\nI wouldn't want to invite someone THAT standoffish into my home, either, even if they were dating my hypothetical kid. I'm not saying she needs to be a social butterfly, but this seems a little extreme.\n\nAll that being said, I still think it's worth making another attempt to get to know her.\n\nNow if they both still insist on nobody asking questions to get to know her or even talking to her, and she makes no attempt to interact with people, I would think that's a pretty big red flag.\n\nEdit: after thinking about it, I decided to change my opinion to ESH.", "YTA This is the perfect opportunity to try to get to know her. Who knows you might surprise yourself and actually like her. Surely there's someway to make sleeping arrangements for her.", "YTA.  It\u2019s his GF.  If he wants her invited, she should be invited.  Are you not going to go to the wedding if they get married?  Only invite your son and not his wife to family events?", "YTA \n\nThis is your *son\u2019s* party, so why shouldn\u2019t *he* have a say in the guest list? \n\nYou say you don\u2019t know her. This seems like the perfect opportunity to *get to know her*. You\u2019re essentially alienating her for no good reason. You never know, this girl could become your daughter-in-law, and you\u2019re starting off on the wrong foot with her. \n\nUnless you want the possibility of your son going LC/NC on you in the future because of your attitude, I would take this opportunity to start afresh. Invite her, get to know her. Don\u2019t pre-judge her. She could well be the best thing to happen to your son, and you will miss out on things in his future if you can\u2019t come down from your ivory tower.", "YTA. Whom exactly do you think this party is for, you or your son?", "Your first impression is completely on you. She said nothing except to tell you she was also college educated. You ASSUMED she was judging you, that is in your own head. It can be scary meeting the boyfriends parents, she could be an introvert, she could be a complete judgemental brat. The fact is, you don't know. Hel is a grown adult with a college degree. It sounds like he doesn't talk to you either. I predict he will get a job closer to his girlfriend and since none of you communicate, you will wonder why he never calls you and you will blame her. In this case, you are being judgemental with nothing to base it on except your \"feelings\" .YTA", "I'd be asking the son if I'm still banned from getting to know her, asking questions and making conversation.\n\nI'll say esh.\n\nNot inviting your son's gf is going to result in your son leaving your life. However your son's and his gf banning interaction at your son's graduation is a major red flag.", "YTA. Invite the GF. All your reasons not to are poor excuses. Make the effort. Or wait\u2026 is this party actually about YOU and what you want? Is this a look how great of a parent I am, show off my son, hide all the imperfections, check out our perfect white picket fence party?", "YTA.  Invite her to the party.  That doesn't include an invitation to stay at your  house.  Also did all you college- educated folks have a conversation with son about his girlfriend's reaction to you and why he wouldn't tell you anything about her?  Communicate.", "YTA - you should never have excluded the girlfriend.  I get she made a bad first impression but maybe she is very shy and was nervous.  Meeting a SO\u2019s family for the first time is nerve wracking.  You should do you best to be welcoming and include her.  Instead you are going out of your way to be the exact opposite.  You will lose your son if you keep this behavior up.", "YTA. Regardless of how you feel about her, she\u2019s your son\u2019s girlfriend and it\u2019s going to put your son in a very difficult position when (and it will be when, not if) he inevitably has to explain to her why you didn\u2019t want to invite her to his graduation party. Your first impression of her wasn\u2019t great but you owe it to your son to at least put in some effort to get to know her, and to not do something that will actively poison the relationship between you and her. \n\nIf you\u2019re not cool with them sharing a room have your son sleep on the couch/floor and give her his room.", "YTA. Are you jealous?", "NTA- He wants to give his gf 2 weeks notice about the party? It\u2019s kind of too late to feel guilty at this point.", "YTA. You say you don't know her yet you've already decided you don't like her. How are you going to get to know her if you keep excluding her? Your son isn't going to break up with her just because you dislike her. If you keep excluding her your son won't like YOU. And then you won't have to worry about inviting her because he won't want to spend time with you anymore.", "YTA it\u2019s HIS party, why wouldn\u2019t his gf be there or you respect his wishes about it.\n\nHow are you suppose to know her if you exclude her?", "YTA it's his graduation party and his gf the time for knowing who your son was in a relationship with was back in highschool not college, he's an adult you don't have to know her", "YTA. The party is for him, and he wants her there. Let him know you don't have the space to offer her a place to stay, but she's welcome at the party.\n\nHe gets to choose his own partners. If you don't want him to choose them over you, then don't make him choose between you. You're an adult; you know how to be polite to people you don't necessarily feel comfortable with.", "YTA. You can suck it up for one day, being around someone who makes your son happy. If she doesn\u2019t make him happy, he\u2019ll figure it out. You can\u2019t exclude her, it\u2019ll make him unhappy and there\u2019s really no good reason not to include her.", "YTA.  Presumably, she can make her own transportation arrangements. This is his girlfriend, and he wants her there. Yes, your son canceled on you; but you put him in a difficult position in the first place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At the graduation ceremony, we met his girlfriend for the first time. She lives in another state (halfway across the country) and flew in for the ceremony. We knew he was dating someone and was told the bare basics about her (name, age, job). He told me to not ask questions about her. I assume they met on a dating app. He rarely talks about her and never showed us a picture of her. She did not want to sit with us during the ceremony, and didn't talk to us when we went out to dinner afterwards. I felt like she was extremely judgy, looked myself and my daughter up-and-down, and kept bragging about having a college education  (we all also have one).\n\nI talked to my son about giving him a small graduation party (Under 20 people. Neighbors/close friends. No extended family since they all live out of state). I said I wasn't comfortable inviting his gf since we don't know her, we don't have a guest room for her to stay in and I will be busy cooking/prepping for the party. He said he was fine with that and seemed happy to have a small celebration. \n\nIt's now two weeks before the party and he is saying he doesn't want a grad party unless he can invite his gf. I explained how invites were sent out weeks ago, food has been purchased, rentals arranged etc... and since he had previously agreed to everything - I was not cancelling the party. He admitted that he did agree to having the party but has since changed his mind. He said he doesn't want to lie to his gf about having a party and not inviting her. He said we could still have it as long as we don't call it a graduation party. I said fine, but I am still using the decorations since they were already purchased. \n\nNow I am conflicted. I really don't want his gf here because I didn't get a good first impression, logistically it would be a nightmare picking her up/dropping off from the airport since he works odd hours at his new job, and I don't know where she would stay. \n\nSo AITA for not wanting to invite his gf to the grad party?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also are you the only person with a car in the whole town that uber/other people picking her up/public transport are not an option?", "YTA for judging her from that one interaction. What you're going to end up doing is alienating your son and you'll try and blame her for that. It will be your own fault for not being flexible and giving her a real chance.", "Name does not check out", "YTA. The party isn't for you. There's no excuse for you not inviting  your son's girlfriend to a party that's for your SON.", "YTA: She sounds awkward/socially anxious rather than judgemental/mean. You don't need to pick her up or make it easy to come. You simply need to send and invite and let HER decline if it's a logistical mess.", "Ooh that\u2019s a hard one bc he did agree to it but I probably would have just invited her in the first place. She is his girlfriend and she may not even have been able to come. Also, your business, not mine but do you need a guest room for her?", "Your son wants her there, so invite her. You won\u2019t get to know her by keeping her at arms\u2019 length. \n\nHowever, if you are expecting any particularly nosy guests, you may want to give her a heads up, and the issue of her attending may resolve itself.", "YTA \n\n\nWhose graduation party is it again? You couldn\u2019t be feeding more into her dislike of her than if you called her and said \u201cwe are having a party and you aren\u2019t invited\u201d and hang up. Good luck with your son when he goes LC in a couple years!", "Oh mom come on. Invite the girl and be the better person. What have you got to loose? YTA", "She would sleep in his bed. Obviously. \nYTA.", "The graduation was held in an extremely large venue with plenty of seating. She doesn't know anyone else in our state. She insisted on sitting by herself before she met the family. My son said she didn't feel comfortable sitting with us because we might try to get to know her by asking her questions. Before dinner, the family engaged in conversation with her but she would reply with one word or not speak. At dinner she sat at the far end of the table and seldom made eye contact, so it was difficult to start a conversation. \n\nMy son also invited his best friend to the dinner. She sat across from him and kept telling him she had a college degree. No idea why, since the friend also has a college degree. The friend was also asking her questions during dinner (they have met before) but she didn't speak to him much either.", "She bragged about being college educated, is she older? I wondered about this too lol.\n\nETA: maybe she just has really bad social anxiety.", "Yes I have tried several times to have conversations with my son. He still will not tell us anything.", "Consider she might have been nervous about meeting family the first time....The party might go better.", "Any idea what the issue is with asking her questions?  How else are you supposed to get to know her?", "So she is socially awkward and she sat far away from you. That doesn't make her toxic enough to exclude her.\n\nINFO: What did your son say before she felt like she had to point out her degree? \n\nINFO: Does she by chance come from a different ethnicity?", "I don\u2019t know her reasons, but I would really not enjoy having to sit with my partner\u2019s parents for hours upon our first meeting without my partner there as a buffer. That\u2019s a ton of pressure. I\u2019d rather save my energy for the dinner.\n\nSounds like she\u2019s an introvert who was nervous about meeting her boyfriend\u2019s family.", "NTA - She seems extremely reluctant to know you. Would she even come to the party? I mean, people might ask her questions!", "Did you ask your son why you shouldn\u2019t ask the questions? Maybe she has really bad social anxiety or something.", "How have you treated him and his relationships in the past?  \n\nEither way, I digress.  Invite her to the party, not to stay at your home.  She can easily Uber to a hotel - why would you worry about picking her up at the airport?   Not your problem.   Be a gracious and welcoming party host.  If everyone is on good behviour, hopefully it will go well.", "Last month my son went away for the weekend with her (this was the 5th time he has met her in person).\n\n I asked where they were going/doing etc... not interrogating - just genuinely curious in getting to know more about her. He refused to tell me anything.", "She was talking to the friend about her degree. She just kinda blurted it out several times. Not sure why. Friend also seemed confused.\n\nShe is white. I am half Asian.", "Maybe she is in witness protection \ud83e\udd23", "But seriously, I see this as another reason to invite her, she might not even come. But the invite would show kindness and would support the son. Also, it\u2019s possible she has really bad social anxiety.", "Maybe because it was a graduation?", "Maybe she suffers from \"all Asians are academics\" clich\u00e9 racism. Weird. \n\nDefinitely sounds like she felt insecure.\n\nBut is it bad enough to exclude her? Maybe given a 2nd chance she will thaw."]}
