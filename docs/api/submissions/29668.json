Make a list of all the family members who do care about you. Then think hard about the people on that list. Who can you realistically help get out of poverty. Be it getting them trained for a profession, set up a shop, help with education or sponsor so they can get to your country. Then pick one. That is the person you focus your efforts and money on.

To this end I would not be harsh towards them. Having said this, you were visiting your family, not there to allocate funds. The problem is that there will always be more need and worthy causes than your resources allow for. If you are going to give money away there will always be those for whom you are the angle and those for whom you are the devil. This sounds extremely stressful.

Someone first world arguing that the gap between someone in the first world vs someone in the developing or third world is \u201cnot quite as big\u201d comes off as highly clueless about how much of the world lives.\n\nMy dog has more possessions, better access to medical care and a more comfortable life than those my cousins work with overseas.\n\nYes, they can afford to feed a village with the same budget I use for my immediate family, but also my budget would stretch a lot further if I bought the same kind of food and that was all we were eating. We also tend to have food in the cupboards so if we didn\u2019t go to the store once it doesn\u2019t mean we have no food.\n\nYes, clothing here is more expensive but we also buy a lot more of it more often and somehow still have much more disposable income left over.\n\nThe amount of wealth is not comparable.", "I'm in Canada, windfall winnings are NOT TAXABLE! \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73", "I\u2019d say that she is also annoyed because, if she has more contact with them, she\u2019s afraid that various relatives will hold it against her that she gave Cousin A more than Cousin B, and also that relatives will think that she has money when she doesn\u2019t.

Oftentimes, it takes arranging for people to be in the same position before you can make them understand how annoying it is to be asked for something repeatedly.", "Yea, businessbear doesn't understand something, even though your base costs are usually much higher (rent, food, etc), your disposable income is also much higher. This means you can afford things like a car, or a daily coffee, or better clothes, while someone in a poorer country doesn't have access to those things.", "Yip cooking at home instead of takeout for one meal can be a week's groceries in the third world.", "As someone that lives in the third world, this comment is offensive.\n\nYes there are poor people (just like every country). But there is also a ron of social aid. Not to mention free universal healthcare and education. \n\nAnd I bet I and many people I know im my 3rd world country have a better quality of life than you. No consumer debt. Own several properties outright. At least one or two big international vacations every year. \n\nOf course some countries have a much larger rate of poverty.
