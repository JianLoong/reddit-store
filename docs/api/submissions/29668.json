Make a list of all the family members who do care about you. Then think hard about the people on that list. Who can you realistically help get out of poverty. Be it getting them trained for a profession, set up a shop, help with education or sponsor so they can get to your country. Then pick one. That is the person you focus your efforts and money on.

To this end I would not be harsh towards them. Having said this, you were visiting your family, not there to allocate funds. The problem is that there will always be more need and worthy causes than your resources allow for. If you are going to give money away there will always be those for whom you are the angle and those for whom you are the devil. This sounds extremely stressful.
