With her controlling your money. \n\nSo you just gave her full control of the money and removed the middleman and let your relatives know who to ask if they needed money.\n\nIt was a brilliant move to end her power play.", "NTA\n\nYour relatives sound like leeches (no offence). I don't know why she was embarrassed. Her child was able to give her a large sum of money to help the family. That sounds like something to be proud of (or at least grateful for).\n\nShe is your mum, though. I'd try and talk to her eye-to-eye about how much you should be financially supporting EVERYONE in the family.", "NTA\n\n\nAnd lol... I can imagine the relatives swarming your mom like cash falling from the sky...\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 Lol. I think what you did was hilarious, and way to remove yourself entirely from the situation. Now if she's so keen to share \"your\" wealth then she has to do so on her own... \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02 I feel sorry for mom, but honestly she should totally rock the whole Mafia Dom vibe and roll with it.. she's probably just mad because she was overwhelmed by the needy, roll on Mafia Mom.. \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nYour mom did this to herself by expecting you to give her \"needy\" family members money.\n\nYou put her on the spot with them and it made her mad.\n\nDon't go on any more trips with her.  It's not a vacation, it's a begging event to extract money   \n from the \"rich foreign relatives.\"\n\nGood Luck", "NTA, all you did was turn her charity cases' attention from you to her. Heaven forbid she actually has to dole out the cash she has been expecting you to do.", "NTA. Yes you embarrassed her and you also handled the situation quite nicely.  She prob won\u2019t forget this but hopefully you will be treated with more respect next time you visit!", "NTA I\u2019m no way should your mom be offering your money out as hand outs. This culture of because I worked hard and have I owe everyone related to me money is BS. Don\u2019t go on vacation with your mom.", "NTA! Sometimes, the only way to get people to realize how annoying it is to be asked for something *constantly* is to arrange for them to be in the same position. \n\nYour mother didn't like people asking her for cash all night, but she was perfectly fine with you being in that position for days.\n\nThis exact kind of thing is why no one other than my husband has any clue how much money I make \ud83d\ude05 I had a small inheritance come through, but because it was contested pretty openly, people knew about it and the relative amounts. I literally had people asking me for money before the check even fucking cleared. People I hadn't spoken to in a decade... friends just expecting I'd give them thousands whenever they asked. 3 people even asked me to help pay their rent for a while. I wasn't *close* to any of them.\n\nHonestly, I empathize with you. *Some* people take an attitude where you having money means THEY have money, no matter how stupid that is. I sincerely hope your mother learned the lesson you intended to teach before it winds up straining/ruining your relationship with her and making your visit any more awkward.", "INFO: Did you have a conversation with your mother about how this made you feel before reaching this point?", "I think what you did was brilliant, bravo.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I would tell your mom you won\u2019t be visiting very often since they view you as a cash cow.", "Apparently you need to not visit or learn how to say no. NTA", "NTA, now she knows how it feels", "BRAVO!!! NTA.", "NTA. You did unto her exactly what she had done to you.", "NTA...\n\nI think you were BRILLIANT", "NTA your mom is blaming the wrong person and needs to open her eyes, her family are leeches", "NTA however do not go on vacation with your mom to her home country, again!", "NTA, but you need to tell her the bank of OP is closed before you visit her again.", "NTA\n\nRepeat after me, NO, NO, NO, NO.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe expected you to go through that. I think the solution you came up with was brilliant.\n\nBut you've got to decide if you want to accept being used as an ATM. I know it's the norm. You know it's the norm. If you don't like being used as an ATM, don't visit your family there. \n\nOtherwise, anytime you do visit, handle it exactly like you did.", "NTA. Very clever way to handle it, in fact!", "NTA.  You didn't embarrass her at all.   This is on mom, who thought she could come out looking great if she got you to give your money and left you to deal with the aftermath when you had to say 'no'.  Instead she had to say no, and now she is all butthurt because she had to make choices and feel the consequences.\n\nNice job out maneuvering her!", "This was a prickly way to make your mom understand that being asked for money is annoying.  Instead maybe you could have mentioned to her how you were feeling before you got to such an angry state.  Mild YTA for letting your emotions get the better of you.   But to move forward maybe share the first sentence of your post with her.", "Okay I get why it was annoying and why you did it, but YTA for the execution. You could have given it to your mum privately and sorted it out together, but you made a scene and caused her stress.", "NTA\n\nBut all these hypercritical posters chastising her begging relatives seem to not appreciate the enormous wealth gap between you and people in your mom\u2019s home country.\n\nWe used to return to my wife\u2019s homeland and experienced something kinda similar (but much less extreme). We\u2019d bring thousands of dollars in gifts and pay for dinners and stuff.\n\nYou sounded very unprepared for all of this and unsure how to handle all the unsolicited requests. Consider this a learning process so next time you visit, you can make a plan to handle all the unwanted solicitations. And a clear budget.\n\nPublicly giving her a large wad of cash did put your mom in a very awkward position. Maybe you could sincerely apologize and explain you didn\u2019t know how to handle the situation.", "Well... You behaved extremely poorly by the standards of the area you are visiting, embarrassed your mom, spent a bunch of money, and will likely start being pestered for more money as soon as you are sober enough to be asked.\n\nNext time talk to your mom about the relationship dynamics and *why* she is behaving the way she is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Though I understand why you help them and it is nice of you. There is still a big economic difference.\n\nThe unfortunate side effect of this though is that they all will see you mainly as a bank and start to value you only for the money you can provide and not really for the person you are. Should you ever have bad financial times and can't help them anymore, they might drop you like a hot potato as you lost all value to them.", "So they earn less than you.
