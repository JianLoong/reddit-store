She lives in Canada with her newborn twins, Iris and Laila. I moved to England a few years ago to study at my dream university. I ended staying there with my now husband, Lewis (30m).\n\nSadie got pregnant at 18 with Tyler, her boyfriend at that time. Tyler and his sister ended up in a car accident a few months after she announced she was pregnant. He and his sister didn't end up surviving the accident. Sadie was very upset during the rest of her pregnancy. My parents were luckily there to help her out.\n\nAfter her babies were born, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer because of all his smoking. My mom had to help my dad out a lot and didn't have as much time to help Sadie with her twins. Sadie reached out to me a few months ago and asked if we could send her some money every month so she could hire a babysitter for her kids and help my dad. Lewis and I agreed since we were financially stable and could afford it.\n\nShe was very thankful to us, but a few weeks ago, she reached out again and asked if we could move back to Canada to help with the twins. This time, Lewis and I refused. I feel like it's too much, we've built a life here in England and my husband has a demanding job here and it would take him a while to find another one in Canada. My mom has sent me a few texts begging for me to come back because they could really use the help. Now, I feel kind of bad, AITA?\n\nSome info on Tyler's family: Tyler's sister is actually his half-sister. They share a dad. His sister is over a decade older than him and has raised Tyler since he was 11. His mom died while giving birth to him and their dad died of a terminal illness. His sister's mom just wasn't in her life.

And a transatlantic move at that. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f You are kind enough to send money every month. That's way more than a lot of people would get from their relatives.", "NTA. You do not need to uproot your life for anybody, family or not. And you're contributing financially, which again you don't have to do.", "NTA. You're already helping financially. Uprooting your entire lives to move to a different country is an extreme ask in my opinion.", "You cannot in any way be expected to give up your life in England to help your sister with her kids, and it's pure insanity to expect it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't uproot your life for someone else's children. You're already doing far more than you have to by sending money every month.", "NTA.\n\nIt's an unfortunate situation all around, but you've been helping out the best you can through financial support. It's unreasonable for your family to expect you to uproot everything and move across the pond just to care for your sister's twins.", "NTA- expecting you to move countries to support them is too much. Sending them money and maybe helping them find local resources is enough. I live in Canada, Sadie can qualify for subsidized daycare for the twins which will help during the week.", "NTA\n\nIt's great you guys are willing and able to financially help out the family during a tough time. But asking you to uproot your entire lives and move country is just too much.\n\nYou could offer to do the legwork to figure out if they would qualify for any government or charitable org assistance programs.", "NTA...their situation sucks and it's really hard on them but it's a really big ask for you to relocate your life again, not to mention that they want you to come back to be essentially a nurse and babysitter on top of whatever financial support you're willing to give.", "NTA you're doing a lot for her as is.\n\nHer situation is absolutely tragic and if you lived nearby I'd say help her when you can. But you don't.\n\nMaybe offer when it's an option to come stay with her for a week or so here and there. \n\nAsking you to move across the world is unfair. Maybe they should move to _you_.", "NTA why should you uproot your life because your sister decided to be a teen mom. You're already being more than generous to send her money", "NTA  - This is significantly more than just helping out with twins. They are asking you to uproot and change your whole life. I get it that it must suck for them but this is way beyond a normal request and sadly for them this is just too big of an ask.", "Move back? C'mon. NTA", "NTA. What a tricky situation though. You gave money for a sitter, which in my opinion is support. It's not fair to be expected to uproot your life you've built for yourself.", "NTA. I'll bet that when your dad was healthy, that Sadie had a bit more of a social life than she does now. Asking you to uproot your life (and your husband's) job in order to help is unimaginable. You already are supporting her financially. Ask her how are you and your husband supposed to support yourselves without a good job. And what about the twin's grandparents? Or his side of the family. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA. It is ridiculous that your sister and your mom think you should uproot your entire life and move countries to help take care of your sister\u2019s twins. I bet they would expect you to continue to provide financial assistance too. They should look into whether they are eligible for local or federal assistance programs.", "NTA\n\nYou're not obligated to uproot your entire life to help your sister. It's unfortunate they are still needing assistance but that shouldn't come at the cost of you and yours.", "NTA. You simply do not move to a different continent to babysit. There must be others who can do that. You have even helped financially although you are under no obligation to do so. It is tough on your sister, but really time for her to pull up her big girl pants and face the music.", "NTA at all.\n\nYou have a life of your own.\n\nI can see that you're already helping financially and that's really generous of you.\n\nWhere are the fathers family? Does he not have a mom or dad? Is your dad recovering or is his cancer life limiting?\n\nMy only suggestion would be to possibly help her find an overnight nurse or in house help like an au pair?\n\nThe struggle is real with one child let alone two.\n\nIf you have the ability to help her further then you should consider it. Of course they're her responsibility completely, but if you love her and want to help her sanity then this might be something you and your partner could consider.\n\nHope your dad feels better.", "NTA\n\nYou get to have your own life. That's all there is to it. You help financially. You are not responsible for other people's children, even if they are relatives. It's clear the expectation would be actual childcare and the like.

That\u2019s an unreasonable ask. NTA.", "NTA, it's not your job to raise her kids.", "NAH - I don't think your sister is an AH. She is scared and drowning and she asked for help. You said no and she seems to have dropped it. I am not sure a few texts begging for help makes your mom an AH, but she is leaning that way. Especially if she doesn't drop it. \n\nPeople are not AHs for asking for help. They are only AHs if they don't respect your right to decline.\n\nAnd I do not think you are the AH for declining in this case.", "NTA \n\nYou're already being very generous by helping monetarily, which is above and beyond what most people would do.\nTbh, what she's asking for sounds very unreasonable.", "NTA. There must be boundaries to the limit of help given. You are helping her financially, and that is great of you and your husband. But to uproot your life is just asking too much. Are there no other relatives that can help out? \n\nYour husband will bear the majority of the financial hit if you move, and if things don't work out, you are putting your own marriage at risk. You can't help your family if you are in financial difficulties.", "NTA\n\nYou helped how you could, but expecting you to uproot your life and move across the world is just a bit much.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your family are the AH either; they just sound desperate because of their situation and it is understandable. Still, what they are asking is not realistic. You are already helping by sending money which is very generous of you. Asking you to uproot your lives is an entirely different matter.", "NTA. If you feel obliged, help out however you can, but you\u2019ve made a life in England. You won\u2019t be an asshole if you stay.", "NTA- you have been supporting your sister by sending money for a sitter. What your sister wants is for you to completely uproot your life so she can have someone share in the responsibility of raising her kids. She is realizing she can't go out with friends or have some time away because being a parent is a full time job. While there are a lot of aspects out of her control - the father of the twins passing and your dad being sick and needing your mom's help - getting pregnant at a young age was completely within her control. \n\nAny one who decides to have a child has to accept  that they made the choice to have a child and that responsibility does not pass on to ANYONE after the birth. Asking for help from time to time is expected, but not required by anyone.", "NTA - this isnt just her asking to help, its her asking for you to uproot your entire life.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to give up your life to help out. If you were still in the same country, fair enough, but to have to leave the life you\u2019ve built up, no I\u2019m sorry, they\u2019re AH for expecting it", "NTA\n\nWhere does Tyler's family stand in regards to the twins? Can your sister not have them be involved either with physically helping care for the twins or offering financial support? \n\nWhile it was Extremely generous of you and your husband to offer some financial support to your sister it is completely out of line for her and your mother to not accept your declining to move countries to help care for her children. \n\nYour sisters chouces and the tragic loss of the twins father does not negate your life. You are under no legal or moral obligation to dedicate both your future and your husbands future to someone else's responsibilities.", "NTA - she\u2019s being unreasonable.  She chose to have children and while her situation is tragic, it\u2019s not something you just change your entire life for.  Does she not have anything from Tyler\u2019s side of the family?", "NTA.  You've been generous sending her money.  Her asking you to uproot your life is a bridge too far.  Your sister needs to look for resources closer to home.  Tell your mom the truth...you won't be much help to your sister if you move to Canada and your husband can't find a job.", "It\u2019s great that you helped out by sending money!

Which is fair especially given your Dad now has lung cancer, and your parents can give limited help.\n\nThey aren't arseholes for asking you to go back and help given the really shitty situation and you aren't an arsehole for not wanting to move countries and find new jobs because of your sisters incredibly bad luck.\n\nIf there is also nothing stopping just you going back to help your sister and see your dad given he sounds very ill, could you go back for a few weeks/months to help them get something in place as they probably can't see the forest for the trees atm?\n\nI'm guessing Canada has some decent social services compared to the rest of the world, so she may need help navigating that.\n\n\\*edit\\* updated after Tyler's family information added to OP.", "Tell them by moving home your jobs and income will greatly be affected and while you would be closer to help with the kids and your dad there would be zero financial support.

I am interested in how this was explained though. She said she needed help with the kids so she could help dad. Mom also calls asking for help, presumably because she is also struggling being a carer to dad.

If you have the time and stability, could a visit home for a few weeks be a possibility? If so, it could be a decent compromise, even if you need to figure something out with work and savings.

So sister is already cutting her some slack.", "I think it\u2019s fine to ask. What\u2019s wrong with asking? Op is perfectly fine to say no. Op, you\u2019re already helping with money. You are a good person and sister", "I am reading this poor girls story and am about to grab my passport, jump on a plane and help her out.  She is drowning!!!", "They did ask.  They have their answer.", "It\u2019s posts with comments like these that remind me most of Reddit lacks nuance (which is obvious, I know, but sometimes I forget). OP is not an AH for not uprooting her life, but gosh, this poor sister. Sometimes no one is an asshole and life is unfair and horrible.", "And therapy is always required", "Like, thanks for the money, but now can you just sacrifice your entire life to come raise my children with me?", "Then why not ask OP to pay for a caregiver instead of a baby sister? Or ask her for both? They went straight to move countries and destroy your life to help me raise the kids I chose to have at a young age. I think moms applying pressure mainly just because she misses her I\u2019m 90% sure the sisters asking because she\u2019s realizing she can\u2019t act like a regular 19 y/o anymore and it\u2019s driving her crazy and again if that\u2019s not the case when when she asked her to move why not say op why don\u2019t you move home to help with dad instead of op move home to take care of my kids \u201cso I can help with dad\u201d it would make more sense for op to be taking care of the dad instead of the kids so the sister could focus on her kids completely", "you think a consequence of having sex is\u2026 being a 19 year old mother of twins with a dead boyfriend/baby daddy ? truly go to therapy. she asked once and dropped it because she feels like she has NO ONE. op should not move and was right to say no but this doesnt make the young widow any name you decide to call her", "It\u2019s one thing If you\u2019re looking to get a temporary work visa (and then try and make things more permanent once you\u2019re there) as a single person but having dependents complicates things considerably.", "Why does the conversation immediately go to: they must move there permanently? Even a two week- 8 week visit would be a massive help to OP's sister right now. In 8 weeks she will have two entirely different babies and she will have more experience caring for them, while also being more physically recovered from their birth. OP doesn't have to uproot and move. She can offer to come home for a short period and help.", "and finding herself unable to take care of them may mean she should reconsider keeping them or putting them up for adoption so they can get the appropriate care they need", "She asked her sister to *move back* to Canada though. Basically giving up her (& her husband's) life to become a 2nd parent to her twins. It's gonna be all about her & her kids' needs &' just helping' isn't what she has in mind, or what it would end up being, even if that's all she's asking for", "This. There doesn't have to be an AH here. This is a terribly sad situation for all of them. NAH.", "Because when you're established in your career and have kids later, it's more likely you can afford life insurance, which your surviving partner can use to help take care of the kids if something happened to you.\n\nBut either way, Tyler living or dying, it's just not a good idea to have kids so young.", "Just to be clear, she was only a few months pregnant when the baby daddy died. So yes, she chose to have the twins even knowing that there was no one outside of her parents to support her.", "the fact that people wouldn't even give their family the space to ASK, is crazy to me. No one held a gun to her head to abandon her whole life. And you never know if someone's ready for an opportunity for change, it's worth it to ask your SISTER. She clearly was backed into a corner to even ask someone so far away but damn, can we not have conversations with our family?", "its unbelievable. this sub is past the point of no return", "Exactly. She asked in likely a moment of desperation. She did not push the issue. You\u2019re rarely TA to ask once. Your behaviour afterwards is what determines the verdict. This is an easy NAH.", "Im irrational in this? The comment I left this on stated that the 19yr old sister asked to be a single mom. When she had a living breathing boyfriend she chose to have these twins with. She didn\u2019t choose for him to die.", "Nope, just checked out the youth mobility scheme requirements. You're not eligible if you have kids under 18 living with you.\n\nShe can visit for 6 months without a visa.", "I'm at least 4th generation of being cared by a village, my kids 5th. My mother in law was over in 5 minutes when I needed to take my daughter to the er. I help my mother in law randomly whenever she needs it. My husband fixed my parents' window that was leaking during the storm. My brother in law helped us fix our deck. We helped him when we he needed it 10 years ago. My mom was raised by her grandparents. We lived with my aunt when we fell on hard times. My mother moved back in with my aunt when she was on hospice. My mom took care of her grandmother for many years, who raised her like a daughter. She always called her momma. \n\nI'm lucky to have been witness and a part of amazing villages. But I know everyone doesn't have this. And I have many friends who are jealous of me for it. And I know people whose village are their friends/adopted family. \n\nBut all in all, I don't expect any of them to help me if they can't. And I've had to say no when I couldn't. My mom would give the shirt off her back though \ud83d\ude06 to the point I call her and remind her to always put her mask and life vest on first!", "how is it OP's fault they don't know how to use a condom or abort? Like family planning is literally a thing. What did she expect? Her 18 year old boyfriend was suddenly going to be able to get a non-minimum wage job to be able to pay for him, her and the kids? She doesn't even have a degree.", "But who says their jobs or financial situation would allow for such an extended stay? I wouldn't be able to get that much time off without losing my job, especially with such short notice. She said her husband's job was very demanding. And just bcuz they're financially stable doesn't mean they can afford to not work for a long time, or travel & other expenses going to & staying in another country", "Amen!!!!", "and just assumed her parents would help her raise her own children", "Way to deliberately misrepresent things.\n\nThey aren't saying that, they are saying that the constant harassment of OP by her mother after being told that OP won't be moving to ***an entirely different continent*** is too much. Do you have any idea how far Canada is from the UK? Let me help you: it's a 7 1/2 hour flight from London to Ottawa.\n\nWhat is OP supposed to do for employment and housing in Canada? What about the things she owns in the UK? What about her husband? Does he come too? And where will he work?\n\nThe sister and mom aren't asking for a visit, they are asking OP to commit to helping them for an unknown length of time, in a country literally an ocean away.", "I thought it was the mom asking, not the sister?", "If you think that's nuts, you should see the threads saying she should just give the kids up for adoption. Peak Reddit right there.", "And maybe that 'someone else' should be someone actually living in the same city?   In the same province?  In the same country?  On the same continent?", "The person you're replying to might be talking about a college diploma (which we all know she doesn't have). I'm guessing you're referring to a high school diploma. They also said financial security or life experience, not \"a job\", like you said. A job does not always mean financial security. It doesn't mean that in a lot of situations, and it certainly doesn't mean that here because there is no way she has an established career.\n\nIt's also fine they asked for help, just as much as it's fine for OP to say no, but OP's mom keeps begging and pushing the issue.", "reddit is an individualist's playground. if you can't hold the world up on your own, you're too weak and don't deserve anything good.", "It\u2019s harsh but true. If you can\u2019t raise your kids without the rest of your family making huge sacrifices like moving continents to raise your kids, then you might have to look into options like temporary foster care until you get on your feet a bit more.", "3 fiddy", "\"Its an exaggeration\" and multiple family members are dead or dying.", "She will still be able to raise her kids without her sister moving continents, nobody said she couldn't. Feeling so overwhelmed that you feel like you need to ask for that is not the same as it being impossible for her to raise her kids without her sister moving continents.", "And OP moving back wouldn't address those things. The only way she'd be able to help is with looking after the twins, but she's already doing that by giving money for a babysitter. So what 'crisis' is OP meant to solve by moving back?"]}
