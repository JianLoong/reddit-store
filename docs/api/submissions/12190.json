Sadie was very upset during the rest of her pregnancy. My parents were luckily there to help her out. \n\nAfter her babies were born, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer because of all his smoking. My mom had to help my dad out a lot and didn't have as much time to help Sadie with her twins. Sadie reached out to me a few months ago and asked if we could send her some money every month so she could hire a babysitter for her kids and help my dad. Lewis and I agreed since we were financially stable and could afford it. \n\nShe was very thankful to us, but a few weeks ago, she reached out again and asked if we could move back to Canada to help with the twins. This time, Lewis and I refused. I feel like it's too much, we've built a life here in England and my husband has a demanding job here and it would take him a while to find another one in Canada. My mom has sent me a few texts begging for me to come back because they could really use the help.

This is a ridiculous request.", "NTA \n>asked if we could move back to Canada to help with the twins\n\nWOW. \ud83e\udd2f I was expecting a 'hey we live in the same town can you comeover' or a 'hey can you come stay for a little while,' but asking you to move is beyond  nuts. And a transatlantic move at that. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f You are kind enough to send money every month. That's way more than a lot of people would get from their relatives.", "NTA. You do not need to uproot your life for anybody, family or not. And you're contributing financially, which again you don't have to do.", "NTA. You're already helping financially. Uprooting your entire lives to move to a different country is an extreme ask in my opinion.", "You cannot in any way be expected to give up your life in England to help your sister with her kids, and it's pure insanity to expect it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't uproot your life for someone else's children. You're already doing far more than you have to by sending money every month.", "NTA.\n\nIt's an unfortunate situation all around, but you've been helping out the best you can through financial support. It's unreasonable for your family to expect you to uproot everything and move across the pond just to care for your sister's twins.", "NTA- expecting you to move countries to support them is too much. Sending them money and maybe helping them find local resources is enough. I live in Canada, Sadie can qualify for subsidized daycare for the twins which will help during the week.", "NTA\n\nIt's great you guys are willing and able to financially help out the family during a tough time. But asking you to uproot your entire lives and move country is just too much.\n\nYou could offer to do the legwork to figure out if they would qualify for any government or charitable org assistance programs.", "NTA...their situation sucks and it's really hard on them but it's a really big ask for you to relocate your life again, not to mention that they want you to come back to be essentially a nurse and babysitter on top of whatever financial support you're willing to give.", "NTA you're doing a lot for her as is.\n\nHer situation is absolutely tragic and if you lived nearby I'd say help her when you can. But you don't.\n\nMaybe offer when it's an option to come stay with her for a week or so here and there. \n\nAsking you to move across the world is unfair. Maybe they should move to _you_.", "NTA why should you uproot your life because your sister decided to be a teen mom. You're already being more than generous to send her money", "NTA  - This is significantly more than just helping out with twins. They are asking you to uproot and change your whole life. I get it that it must suck for them but this is way beyond a normal request and sadly for them this is just too big of an ask.", "Move back? C'mon. NTA", "NTA. What a tricky situation though. You gave money for a sitter, which in my opinion is support. It's not fair to be expected to uproot your life you've built for yourself.", "NTA. I'll bet that when your dad was healthy, that Sadie had a bit more of a social life than she does now. Asking you to uproot your life (and your husband's) job in order to help is unimaginable. You already are supporting her financially. Ask her how are you and your husband supposed to support yourselves without a good job. And what about the twin's grandparents? Or his side of the family. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA. It is ridiculous that your sister and your mom think you should uproot your entire life and move countries to help take care of your sister\u2019s twins. I bet they would expect you to continue to provide financial assistance too. They should look into whether they are eligible for local or federal assistance programs.", "NTA\n\nYou're not obligated to uproot your entire life to help your sister. It's unfortunate they are still needing assistance but that shouldn't come at the cost of you and yours.", "NTA. You simply do not move to a different continent to babysit. There must be others who can do that. You have even helped financially although you are under no obligation to do so. It is tough on your sister, but really time for her to pull up her big girl pants and face the music.", "NTA at all.\n\nYou have a life of your own.\n\nI can see that you're already helping financially and that's really generous of you.\n\nWhere are the fathers family? Does he not have a mom or dad? Is your dad recovering or is his cancer life limiting?\n\nMy only suggestion would be to possibly help her find an overnight nurse or in house help like an au pair?\n\nThe struggle is real with one child let alone two.\n\nIf you have the ability to help her further then you should consider it. Of course they're her responsibility completely, but if you love her and want to help her sanity then this might be something you and your partner could consider.\n\nHope your dad feels better.", "NTA\n\nYou get to have your own life. That's all there is to it. You help financially. You are not responsible for other people's children, even if they are relatives. It's clear the expectation would be actual childcare and the like. If that's not your job don't make it your job.", "You're not required to uproot your life to be additional parents to your sister's children.\n\nShe was fine to ask, you're fine to say no.\n\nNAH", "NTA\u2014 as tragic as your sister\u2019s situation is, it is not on you to move home and fix it. You are absolutely in your right to stay in England and live the life you are building with your husband. Do not feel guilty.", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for someone else\u2019s kids. I don\u2019t know why people feel like their siblings are obligated to look after their kids.", "That\u2019s insane.  Uproot your life and move actual countries to be a nanny for your sister?  That\u2019s an unreasonable ask. NTA.", "NTA, it's not your job to raise her kids.", "NAH - I don't think your sister is an AH. She is scared and drowning and she asked for help. You said no and she seems to have dropped it. I am not sure a few texts begging for help makes your mom an AH, but she is leaning that way. Especially if she doesn't drop it. \n\nPeople are not AHs for asking for help. They are only AHs if they don't respect your right to decline.\n\nAnd I do not think you are the AH for declining in this case.", "NTA \n\nYou're already being very generous by helping monetarily, which is above and beyond what most people would do.\nTbh, what she's asking for sounds very unreasonable.", "NTA. There must be boundaries to the limit of help given. You are helping her financially, and that is great of you and your husband. But to uproot your life is just asking too much. Are there no other relatives that can help out? \n\nYour husband will bear the majority of the financial hit if you move, and if things don't work out, you are putting your own marriage at risk. You can't help your family if you are in financial difficulties.", "NTA\n\nYou helped how you could, but expecting you to uproot your life and move across the world is just a bit much.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your family are the AH either; they just sound desperate because of their situation and it is understandable. Still, what they are asking is not realistic. You are already helping by sending money which is very generous of you. Asking you to uproot your lives is an entirely different matter.", "NTA. If you feel obliged, help out however you can, but you\u2019ve made a life in England. You won\u2019t be an asshole if you stay.", "NTA- you have been supporting your sister by sending money for a sitter. What your sister wants is for you to completely uproot your life so she can have someone share in the responsibility of raising her kids. She is realizing she can't go out with friends or have some time away because being a parent is a full time job. While there are a lot of aspects out of her control - the father of the twins passing and your dad being sick and needing your mom's help - getting pregnant at a young age was completely within her control. \n\nAny one who decides to have a child has to accept  that they made the choice to have a child and that responsibility does not pass on to ANYONE after the birth. Asking for help from time to time is expected, but not required by anyone.", "NTA - this isnt just her asking to help, its her asking for you to uproot your entire life.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to give up your life to help out. If you were still in the same country, fair enough, but to have to leave the life you\u2019ve built up, no I\u2019m sorry, they\u2019re AH for expecting it", "NTA\n\nWhere does Tyler's family stand in regards to the twins? Can your sister not have them be involved either with physically helping care for the twins or offering financial support? \n\nWhile it was Extremely generous of you and your husband to offer some financial support to your sister it is completely out of line for her and your mother to not accept your declining to move countries to help care for her children. \n\nYour sisters chouces and the tragic loss of the twins father does not negate your life. You are under no legal or moral obligation to dedicate both your future and your husbands future to someone else's responsibilities.", "NTA - she\u2019s being unreasonable.  She chose to have children and while her situation is tragic, it\u2019s not something you just change your entire life for.  Does she not have anything from Tyler\u2019s side of the family?", "NTA.  You've been generous sending her money.  Her asking you to uproot your life is a bridge too far.  Your sister needs to look for resources closer to home.  Tell your mom the truth...you won't be much help to your sister if you move to Canada and your husband can't find a job.", "It\u2019s great that you helped out by sending money!  Not a lot of people would do that.  If you can, continue to send money but don\u2019t become their personal ATM.\n\nAs for moving back, that\u2019s way too much.\n\nNTA", "Going with NAH.\n\nYour family begging you to move back and help with your youger sister children, after the unexpectly died, does not make her an arsehole, it just shows she is desperate.  Which is fair especially given your Dad now has lunch cancer.\n\nTyler's parents should be stepping up to help if they can.  There is also nothing stopping just you going back to help your sister and see your dad given he sounds very ill.\n\nThey aren't arseholes for asking you to go back and help given the really shitty situation and you aren't an arsehole for not wanting to move countries and find new jobs because of your sisters bad luck.\n\nCould you go back for a few weeks/months to help them get something in place as they probably can't see the forest for the trees atm?", "Tell them by moving home your jobs and income will greatly be affected and while you would be closer to help with the kids and your dad there would be zero financial support. Offer to watch the twins so she can get a job to support her kids and you and your husband. N t a", "NAH.
