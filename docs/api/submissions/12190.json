She lives in Canada with her newborn twins, Iris and Laila. I moved to England a few years ago to study at my dream university. I ended staying there with my now husband, Lewis (30m).\n\nSadie got pregnant at 18 with Tyler, her boyfriend at that time. Tyler and his sister ended up in a car accident a few months after she announced she was pregnant. He and his sister didn't end up surviving the accident. Sadie was very upset during the rest of her pregnancy. My parents were luckily there to help her out.\n\nAfter her babies were born, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer because of all his smoking. My mom had to help my dad out a lot and didn't have as much time to help Sadie with her twins. Sadie reached out to me a few months ago and asked if we could send her some money every month so she could hire a babysitter for her kids and help my dad. Lewis and I agreed since we were financially stable and could afford it.\n\nShe was very thankful to us, but a few weeks ago, she reached out again and asked if we could move back to Canada to help with the twins. This time, Lewis and I refused. I feel like it's too much, we've built a life here in England and my husband has a demanding job here and it would take him a while to find another one in Canada. My mom has sent me a few texts begging for me to come back because they could really use the help. Now, I feel kind of bad, AITA?\n\nSome info on Tyler's family: Tyler's sister is actually his half-sister. They share a dad. His sister is over a decade older than him and has raised Tyler since he was 11. His mom died while giving birth to him and their dad died of a terminal illness. His sister's mom just wasn't in her life.

And a transatlantic move at that. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f You are kind enough to send money every month. That's way more than a lot of people would get from their relatives.", "NTA. You do not need to uproot your life for anybody, family or not. And you're contributing financially, which again you don't have to do.", "NTA. You're already helping financially. Uprooting your entire lives to move to a different country is an extreme ask in my opinion.", "You cannot in any way be expected to give up your life in England to help your sister with her kids, and it's pure insanity to expect it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't uproot your life for someone else's children. You're already doing far more than you have to by sending money every month.", "NTA.\n\nIt's an unfortunate situation all around, but you've been helping out the best you can through financial support. It's unreasonable for your family to expect you to uproot everything and move across the pond just to care for your sister's twins.", "NTA- expecting you to move countries to support them is too much. Sending them money and maybe helping them find local resources is enough. I live in Canada, Sadie can qualify for subsidized daycare for the twins which will help during the week.", "NTA\n\nIt's great you guys are willing and able to financially help out the family during a tough time. But asking you to uproot your entire lives and move country is just too much.\n\nYou could offer to do the legwork to figure out if they would qualify for any government or charitable org assistance programs.", "NTA...their situation sucks and it's really hard on them but it's a really big ask for you to relocate your life again, not to mention that they want you to come back to be essentially a nurse and babysitter on top of whatever financial support you're willing to give.", "NTA you're doing a lot for her as is.\n\nHer situation is absolutely tragic and if you lived nearby I'd say help her when you can.

Maybe they should move to _you_.", "NTA why should you uproot your life because your sister decided to be a teen mom. You're already being more than generous to send her money", "NTA  - This is significantly more than just helping out with twins. They are asking you to uproot and change your whole life.

You gave money for a sitter, which in my opinion is support. It's not fair to be expected to uproot your life you've built for yourself.", "NTA. I'll bet that when your dad was healthy, that Sadie had a bit more of a social life than she does now. Asking you to uproot your life (and your husband's) job in order to help is unimaginable. You already are supporting her financially. Ask her how are you and your husband supposed to support yourselves without a good job. And what about the twin's grandparents? Or his side of the family. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA. It is ridiculous that your sister and your mom think you should uproot your entire life and move countries to help take care of your sister\u2019s twins. I bet they would expect you to continue to provide financial assistance too. They should look into whether they are eligible for local or federal assistance programs.", "NTA\n\nYou're not obligated to uproot your entire life to help your sister. It's unfortunate they are still needing assistance but that shouldn't come at the cost of you and yours.", "NTA. You simply do not move to a different continent to babysit. There must be others who can do that. You have even helped financially although you are under no obligation to do so. It is tough on your sister, but really time for her to pull up her big girl pants and face the music.", "NTA at all.\n\nYou have a life of your own.\n\nI can see that you're already helping financially and that's really generous of you.\n\nWhere are the fathers family? Does he not have a mom or dad?

That's all there is to it. You help financially. You are not responsible for other people's children, even if they are relatives. It's clear the expectation would be actual childcare and the like.

That\u2019s an unreasonable ask. NTA.", "NTA, it's not your job to raise her kids.", "NAH - I don't think your sister is an AH. She is scared and drowning and she asked for help. You said no and she seems to have dropped it. I am not sure a few texts begging for help makes your mom an AH, but she is leaning that way. Especially if she doesn't drop it. \n\nPeople are not AHs for asking for help. They are only AHs if they don't respect your right to decline.\n\nAnd I do not think you are the AH for declining in this case.", "NTA \n\nYou're already being very generous by helping monetarily, which is above and beyond what most people would do.\nTbh, what she's asking for sounds very unreasonable.", "NTA. There must be boundaries to the limit of help given. You are helping her financially, and that is great of you and your husband. But to uproot your life is just asking too much. Are there no other relatives that can help out? \n\nYour husband will bear the majority of the financial hit if you move, and if things don't work out, you are putting your own marriage at risk. You can't help your family if you are in financial difficulties.", "NTA\n\nYou helped how you could, but expecting you to uproot your life and move across the world is just a bit much.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your family are the AH either; they just sound desperate because of their situation and it is understandable. Still, what they are asking is not realistic. You are already helping by sending money which is very generous of you. Asking you to uproot your lives is an entirely different matter.", "NTA. If you feel obliged, help out however you can, but you\u2019ve made a life in England. You won\u2019t be an asshole if you stay.", "NTA- you have been supporting your sister by sending money for a sitter. What your sister wants is for you to completely uproot your life so she can have someone share in the responsibility of raising her kids. She is realizing she can't go out with friends or have some time away because being a parent is a full time job. While there are a lot of aspects out of her control - the father of the twins passing and your dad being sick and needing your mom's help - getting pregnant at a young age was completely within her control. \n\nAny one who decides to have a child has to accept  that they made the choice to have a child and that responsibility does not pass on to ANYONE after the birth. Asking for help from time to time is expected, but not required by anyone.", "NTA - this isnt just her asking to help, its her asking for you to uproot your entire life.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to give up your life to help out. If you were still in the same country, fair enough, but to have to leave the life you\u2019ve built up, no I\u2019m sorry, they\u2019re AH for expecting it", "NTA\n\nWhere does Tyler's family stand in regards to the twins? Can your sister not have them be involved either with physically helping care for the twins or offering financial support? \n\nWhile it was Extremely generous of you and your husband to offer some financial support to your sister it is completely out of line for her and your mother to not accept your declining to move countries to help care for her children. \n\nYour sisters chouces and the tragic loss of the twins father does not negate your life. You are under no legal or moral obligation to dedicate both your future and your husbands future to someone else's responsibilities.", "NTA - she\u2019s being unreasonable.  She chose to have children and while her situation is tragic, it\u2019s not something you just change your entire life for.  Does she not have anything from Tyler\u2019s side of the family?", "NTA.  You've been generous sending her money.  Her asking you to uproot your life is a bridge too far.  Your sister needs to look for resources closer to home.

Living in ENGLAND however, means you would have to uproot your life. You are not an asshole for not moving. And kudos to you for helping out financially. \n\nYour sister is desperate. She\u2019s super young and in an incredibly stressful situation: grief, loss, newborn babies, terminally sick parent, at an age where she doesnt even have a fully developed pre frontal cortex. You are also suffering the illness of your father, and my condolences to you. Point is, she\u2019s not an ass for asking, you\u2019re not an ass for declining, your mom is a bit of an ass for trying to guilt trip you.", "Honestly NAH simply because I can\u2019t bring myself to call your sister the AH. Was the request unreasonable? Yes. But she\u2019s 19, her boyfriend and his sister died, your parents can\u2019t help and you are doing more than most would with the money. She\u2019s scared and you are definitely not the AH because moving across the world to help with the twins is indeed to much. I would be more willing to call her the AH if she cursed you out and demanded you \u201eown\u201c it to her or sum BS like that, but she didn\u2019t. Shes just desperate for help and that\u2019s okay too, as long as she accepts your answer", "I think OP\u2019s sister and mom are the AH to ask.  I know it is hard to take care of babies without the dad in the picture but they shouldn\u2019t guilt OP into moving back. OP, no is a complete sentence.", "NAH. You\u2019re poor sister is in a terrible situation and it\u2019s understandable that she would get desperate enough to ask for something drastic. \n\nHowever that does not make you T A for saying no, it would be a huge life change for you to move to another country. Don\u2019t feel bad about choosing not to do that.", "NAH\n\nI can imagine how desperate and scared your sister must be to even resort to asking such an outlandish request, and you're not wrong for denying it. It's already very generous of you to send her money. If she's unwilling to relocate to England for assistance, then maybe try to help her find resources local to her for assistance?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHis entitlement is crazy. Do not give in. our mom is an AH, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey expect you to give up YOUR life to help them manage theirs?", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to uproot your entire life to move to a totally different country to help, that\u2019s asking for way too much. You\u2019re not free childcare. While her situation is unfortunate, it\u2019s also not your problem, especially when you\u2019ve helped financially.", "NTA. LOL. Please move to another country to help out with my kids? You've got to be kidding!", "Isn't Lewis the American spelling of Louis? Not that it matters lol NTA", "NTA. She lives in Canada, right? Aren't there programs for single moms there that can help your sister out? The toddler years are rough but that shouldn't require you and your partner to move countries.", "NTA. You send her money monthly which is more than generous. She needs to learn to not bite the hand that feeds her.", "NTA, you do what you can but you have built a life and deserve to live it. Everyone has problems, if you were already helping with childcare, then Moving back won\u2019t really solve that. \n\nRight now your primary concern and relationship is with your husband. So A no it\u2019s a no. A boundary is a boundary. She and your mom can respect those boundaries or you will reallyhave to enforce them and let them know what the consequences will be if it comes to the point of having to reinforce them.\n\nYou are not threatening, you are simply stating what you can and can\u2019t do.\n\nNTA (guilt trips ) end up causing resentment in the end", "Oh. Well, then it'll be easier to move to the UK from Canada. I'm sure the immigration policies in the UK are not too stringent against Canadian citizens.\n\nThere.  Win win.", "NAH\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling guilty hire a nanny for her so she can also work and complete any additional education/training", "NAH\n\nMy concern would be your mother\u2019s request. Is she saying \u201cthey\u201d the parents also need help? Or that they need help with Sadie and the twins? Because if your dad is in poor health, you might need to think about what your mom needs as well right now.\n\nAITA is very \u201cme\u201d focused. But unless you have a bad relationship with your family, you may need to have a serious talk with mom about what they need and what you can do to help.", "NAH. But tbh if you can swing it a visit to see your sick dad, provide support to your mom, meet your nibblets and be empathetic to your sister and maybe help her navigate/find services  would be huge to them as they\u2019re drowning. \n\nYou can\u2019t move their no, but like some others have said, she\u2019s really just grasping at straws as a last ditch effort to be able to breath. She\u2019s really asking for help for the family.", "NAH", "NAH.  They asked, you said no.  And don\u2019t feel guilty - I understand her asking, but really, it\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to just uproot your whole life for her.", "NAH- they can ask but you are not obligated to comply. I think you are already being kind by helping out financially.", "NAH. \nYour sis is not an AH for asking for help. She\u2019s a 19 year old kid that recognizes she\u2019s out of her depth with twin infants and the other parent is dead. Your sister is in a desperate survival mode so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH for asking. If she began hounding you about it, then she\u2019d be an AH, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be what\u2019s happening. You are NOT an AH for refusing to uproot your life to become a parent for kids that you are not responsible for. You\u2019re giving them money, you\u2019ve already been plenty generous by doing what you can. NAH.", "NAH. It's a huge request to have you uproot your family and move to a new country. But also, your dad has CANCER, your mom is struggling to care for him and your teen sister has twins where the father died tragically and is struggling to help your parents too. \n\nThis is all about your dad having cancer as your family desperately struggles to contend with his illness, not about your sister having it all but demanding help with twins anyway. \n\nYour family is in crisis and asked for you. You can absolutely say no, it just seems like you're fixated on being mad at your sister for daring to ask for your help when she's in the thick of said HUGE crisis AND your mom appears to also be behind the question as your dad literally dies slowly and painfully. It's tragic all around, no one here is wrong.", "NTA you are already helping. It is not realistic to throw away the life you have made for yourself.", "NTA- that\u2019s a big ask. Too big.", "Can\u2019t you return home for a period of time to help your mother with your dad?", "That\u2019s ridiculous request. Yeah she needs help but what right does she have to ask a family to uproot their lives? Immature and selfish.", "NTA - After such an insult, in his place I just cut financial aid.  Tell the sister that she is just suffering the consequences of being reckless and getting pregnant before she could support herself, that you feel sorry for her but that you are not going to stop your life because she was irresponsible. Your mother asking you to do this shows that she has a favorite daughter.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your sister but you are not obligated to completely uproot and restructure not just your life but your HUSBANDS life for anyone other than maybe your OWN Children. That\u2019s an unreasonable ask.", "Tell them you are already financially contributing to children who aren\u2019t really your responsibility. And you will not be uprooting your life by moving to support them further. And if they do not like your decision, you and your husband will discuss ending the financial support that they should be grateful for receiving in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous that your sister asked, and that your mother doubled down on it. \n\nYou have your own life to live. And that is in England.\n\nNTA", "NAH. But perhaps sympathizing with her and sending her a care package of supplies/groceries or some money may help rather than you moving again.", "NAH . Do you mind me asking where in Canada? Not obligated to answer but maybe there are some programs to help your sister that she is unaware of. These would be different depending on her location.", "NTA. More than generous of you to help your sister financially to have a babysitter.  To expect you to move and uproot you and your husbands lives so you can help with the care of her kids is unreasonable and selfish.", "Plus, immigration for the husband wouldn't be easy - it would take over a year anyway, and at least $5,000 CDN if they hire a lawyer to help (which is recommended).", "I agree with this. I can\u2019t help but feel deeply sorry for this grieving young 19-year old single mom of twins also nursing her parents through a lung cancer diagnosis\u2026she really must feel like she\u2019s drowning. This isn\u2019t her asking OP to come help with the kids as much as come help with the entire family\u2019s crisis!\n\nOP, if I were you, I would see if I could hire an at-home nurse or research local services that can help your sister and mom. If they belong to a church, maybe also reach out to them and ask for some help. There are things you can do from England to help alleviate the incredible burden without moving back.", "Agreed.  NAH  These are very difficult circumstances for your family.  Asking you to move home is a big ask, but it's just that, asking.  And you've quite reasonably said no.  However, you're family is in trouble.  If you would like to be there to help, could you yourself take a leave of absence from your job, and travel home for a few weeks/months?   And while you are there perhaps follow up on some of the suggestions for putting other help in place.", "Agree and she is helping her financially so it\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t do right by her.", "Maybe Sadie could move to England...", "No assholes here for sure... a bad situation is what it is!!", "She wasn\u2019t fine to ask. It\u2019s the most ridiculous request.", "Uh no? How was she fine to ask that her sister move across the world to help her raise her children after she already gives her money, something that\u2019s already extremely generous.", "> You're not required to uproot your life to be additional parents to your sister's children. She was fine to ask, you're fine to say no. NAH\n\nThe question was AITA for not helping with the newborn twins. And so technically I concur. NAH. People can ask. You can say no. And it is very generous and kind that you\u2019re helping financially. \n\nBut wow OP. I hope nothing bad ever happens to you. Because really? Sadie was \u201cvery upset?\u201d Tyler was her boyfriend \u201cat the time?\u201d Do you trivialize everyone this much or just people who don\u2019t go to Dream Universities? It just feels like your empathy centre is broken.", "Asking a family member to MOVE COUNTRIES SEPARATED BY AN OCEAN for your convenience is WAAAAAAAAAAAY over the line of acceptable requests. NTA", "He sister didn\u2019t decide to be a single teen mom. Her partner died. Further, she didn\u2019t elect to have her own father be stricken with cancer and needing care. Everyone is glossing over the fact that she asked for help with the kids so that she could help with dad. It\u2019s not a case of her not wanting to be a mom, it\u2019s their shared parents needing help.", "This is really uncharitable and clearly based in biases. You don\u2019t know anything about Sadie or her life as a mom. What we do know is that she lost the other parent to her children and now is asking for help so she can care for her own parent-which she shares with OP. She\u2019s not asking so she can party, she\u2019s asking because she and mom are clearly struggling to care for their dying father and need support to do that.", "If you go back and look at the text, it has been edited.

I am betting your mom and sister really  need more help with the cancer patient. Once the twins sleep through the night, it won't be that bad. I needed so much more help with my husband, and I didn't get it. It's easier to say \"the babies\" than it is to speak of the reality of fighting cancer. Go for a visit, and see for yourself what is going on. Be supportive, help find a nurse, but also... see how things are with your father for yourself. You can't understand why they are begging for help.  You can be emotional support from afar, and you can be financially helpful from afar, and visiting and understanding will make you more effective.", "In the edit OP explains that both Tyler\u2019s parents are dead.
