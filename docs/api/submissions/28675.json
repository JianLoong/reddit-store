You also allowed your ex to be in your yard without incident to play with his kids.  You also allowed small talk.  Then, when your ex crossed your line, you informed him that he was over the boundary of your tolerance.  He didn't get ejected and banned until he tried to argue with you about a reasonable boundary.\n\nNow let's look at his actions.  Dude knew it would be an issue.  Decided to push the envelope anyway.  Slowly tested the boundary.  Hit the boundary.  Two possibilities here - 1) you being friendly with his wife made him think you had moved on, maybe he turned a new leaf, wanted to demonstrate that, so started slow and when not met with resistance offered the apology with good intentions or 2) you being friendly with his wife made him realize that she may find out about his shitty behaviors that haven't changed and he became afraid and decided to start some drama with you to show that you are an awful person.  Let's take these possibilities and predict what would happen.  If 1) and you stated what you said (assuming done in a calm and polite manner), then the response would be to maturely accept your boundary and, at worst, retreat back to small talk and at best, stop coming over.  If 2) again assuming calm and polite rejection, he would push the situation into an argument, gaslight the reaction, and then go and spread the story all over town.  Since his reaction aligns with prediction for #2 motives, we know that he's the AH.\n\nYour response to anyone objecting to this situation is to politely point out that dude didn't get banned until he tried to argue with you on your property in front of your kids.

Don't cave into the peer pressure he seems to be orchestrating.", "NTA", "NTA. But consider your life if you were able to just let go of that thing inside you and just not give shit about Rick anymore\u2026.", "Maybe at don\u2019t understand what makes someone an asshole and what makes someone not an asshole. For some of you, it sure seems like the divide between YTA and NTA simply comes down to whether you\u2019re entitled to do something or not.  But there are plenty of things you\u2019re \u201centitled\u201d to do that would still make you an asshole.  You\u2019re \u201centitled\u201d to have a fire pit in your yard, but you\u2019re an asshole if you use it knowing that it triggers an asthma attack in the next door neighbor\u2019s child.  You\u2019re \u201centitled\u201d to avoid vaccinations if you want to, but you\u2019re an asshole if you do so despite being a caregiver for medically vulnerable individuals.  Et cetera.\n\nThis to me falls into the category of \u201cyou\u2019re entitled to, but YTA.\u201d  Take a step back and look at it objectively.  You\u2019ve been broken up for over a decade, your kids are friends and you\u2019re even friends with his wife.  So why are you holding onto this grudge?  You seem to be bound and determined to put the screws to him and this attitude can only make things awkward and uncomfortable for everyone else involved.  You need to move on.  YTA.", "NTA. Your yard your rules.", "You\u2019re 100% the asshole.  It\u2019s been 11 years and you\u2019re still acting like a jilted teen.  You don\u2019t need to get over it, but you need to reconcile yourself with the fact that you created this situation.  It\u2019s BS that you would allow his kids over, but not allow him to be there to supervise.  Not to mention you are putting you and your husband in a somewhat precarious legal situation by refusing to allow him over to watch his kids.  What if something happens to one of them?  You either need to ban his kids (and face the wrath of your own) or let him come over while they are there.  Either way, suck it up and act like an adult.", "NTA. \n\nMy exhusband isn\u2019t welcome at my home to maintain my peace. I would be honest with the people around town.", "I wouldn't let him on either", "Unpopular opinion but YTA. Your kids are friends, he tried to apologize and it's been a long time. You were both young and he made a mistake and has clearly grown and changed. Just let the man spend time with his kids and tell him you don't want a friendship, be civil, your part of the same community.", "Do they know he cheated on you and that it was a horrible situation that caused a lot emotional issues for you? Because if not I would make it clear that that is what he did and that you are allowed to limit that kind of emotional turmoil on your own property. It\u2019s not about being petty, it\u2019s about setting boundaries about what you are willing to allow at your home.", "OP, I would message the wife. \"Listen, I felt that I was being kind allowing you and your kids to be on our property given my history with your husband, but that doesn't seem to be enough. Someone is going around town complaining about me, and I'm being bombarded with messages that it's cruel to allow you and your children on my property, but not your husband. I'm not sure what to do at this point. If it's bothering your family this much, I can understand if none of you want to come over any longer, but I don't want to receive the messages any longer.\"\n\nAlso, THE NERVE of this man to think he's allowed on your property and in your life after he cheated on you!", "I agree she's NTA, But people do make mistakes in life and are capable of changing too. It doesn't mean he has a low moral character because he cheated 11 years ago. (not defending him either, I don't know him and he may in fact have low moral character)\n\nIt is also very obviously about him being her ex, and doing her dirty. She's not going out of her way to be a b!Tch or take out her feeling for one individual on anyone else and she is entitled to hold a grudge if she chooses to.", "I'm not trying to downplay what I said. I was kind of rude about it.\n\nHim: Hey, can we talk?\nMe: No\nHim: Then just listen.\nMe: No\nHim: I just wanted to apologize for hurting you.\nMe: Rick, I don't want to hear it.\nHim: I'm being serious\nMe: honestly I don't give a flying Fuck what you have to say. I don't want to be friends, I don't want to speak to you\nHim: It's been 11 years you petty batch. Let that shit go.\nMe: Leave. I don't want you here.\nHim: My kids are here\nMe: They are welcome to stay, so is your wife, you need to get the fuck off of my property.", "This honestly something I would do once I got to the breaking point. Nothing like showing you've slightly cracked like sending a mass message ment to inspire humiliation, guilt, and reflection for the intended targets. Not to mention you got the perfect amount of sass and anger mixed in to make this one hell of a spicy verbal slap. \ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c", "It\u2019s often the people who haven\u2019t been through things like this themselves who feel the most entitled to tell the people who have how to deal with it.", "I can. I mean she should forgive him right? It ruined his life. That poor man who cheated on his wife should be forgiven because he apologized. Doesn't she understand how hard his life is now? She should just get over it and forgive him. s/", "LOL What kind of Mr. Rogers neighborhood are you living in??? Just let it go, she made her stance that the kids are allowed and he is not very clear already.", "True", "Exactly.  Well said.  IYKYK.  Otherwise, mind your biz.\n\nOp is NTA."]}
