I've asked repeatedly for proof, now I personally don't like my brother at all due to things in our past as kids, so I don't keep in contact with him at all. I was the stay at home mom and my husband was the bread winner. I was trying to be nice and let him use my car for him to be able to get to work, he said he would get some shift hours. The thing is, he hasn't been to work in about a month. My STB ex husband keeps going off with these crazy stories about my brother and my family, so kept getting really mad at me over them for not believing him, and he claims that is the real reason he got fired from his job. Even though he was getting too drunk multiple times and didn't wake up in time, even if I tried to wake him up, and then he got fired from his second job because he wore slippers/slides instead of shoes to a job site. We're going to be kicked out our shared apartment because he lost his jobs and can't pay rent.\n\n Two weeks ago, he was going off on a story about my brother and was getting really angry at me and started yelling so I asked my SIL( brothers wife, we have a good relationship and my brother doesn't live with her atm) to come get me and my kid because of his behavior, we have been living at her house ever since. He's been driving a neighbor around for him to be able to and from work, and saying that the neighbor Sam(not his real name) will pay him back or that he'll get him a job, but still doesn't have one and isn't being paid back. I also haven't seen any of our bills getting paid. He kept spending so much time with Sam and even on our hardest day (our second child's death anniversary). I tried talking to him about how it hurt me that he spends all this time with his friends instead of his family, but he turned it around on me and made it my fault.                                                       \n\nHe said he let Sam take my car to work without even asking me. I told him that it upset me that he gave my car to somebody else without asking beforehand, and he told me he didn't care because I didn't play by \"his rules\" which means blindly believing every word he says about my family and admitting everything wrong in our marriage is my fault. the title of the car is only in MY name, not his. So tonight, my SIL and I drove to the apartment and took the car without telling him,  because I've just had enough of his shit and disrespect.\n\n I feel like I am the asshole because I took the only vehicle that is here in our current state, his vehicle is in another state over 1,000 miles away at my grandparents residence, and I feel guilty that he won't be able to go out anywhere or go to work when he gets a job, nor will his friend be able to get to work. I have interview line up for this weekend and I need to able to get work if I land this interview. So am I the AITA?", "created_utc": 1697693678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bbpf9/aita_for_taking_my_car_back_from_my_husband/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
