We talked to the girls about why they felt they should defend Kurt and explained to them how much his comment\u2019s hurt Brecken. They didn\u2019t have much of a reaction to the talk we had, so we\u2019re still trying to figure out how they feel. \n\nKurt has only been with my wife\u2019s parents for a bit and we\u2019re already hearing he\u2019s being very defiant but we\u2019re not letting him back. \n\nLike I mentioned, this vacation is during my oldest\u2019s spring break so we\u2019re currently spending time with him. \n\nBrecken was very happy when we told him Kurt would be picked up, though he\u2019s still very mad at Kurt and has said stuff like \u201che\u2019s not my brother anymore\u201d, which is definitely something we\u2019re going to bring up  therapists. \n\nAs for the comments mentioning finding anti-racism respected, my sister is an English teacher so we\u2019re going to try to find some stuff she thinks is appropriate for 5th graders in terms of reading levels and what Kurt could comprehend. \n\nWe\u2019ve also been speaking to the parents of the other boys he was texting and they\u2019re all horrified this was going on and said they plan to address it with their sons.\n\nWe also made sure that Brecken knew that we would always support him and his girlfriend and him and his baseball teammates.", "created_utc": 1679613769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1201byb/update_aita_for_making_my_stepson_sleep_on_the/", "score": 199, "replies": ["1. Good for you for removing Kurt  \n2. Good for you for sitting the girls down  \n3. Sure there will be more conversations with the girls but you started so that's great  \n4. Brecken will take time and hopefully therapy for you all will help  \n5. Good job on mentioning to the other parents and hope you don't get blow back for doing the right thing now.   \n6. Still more to be done but sounds like you're headed in the right direction.", "I would make sure you keep these kids in check tbh. Sounds like the girls don\u2019t care about racism either. Not so great if we want to actually make change", "I was hoping for an update on this. My heart was breaking for Brecken <3\n\nI'm glad he's okay. \n\nI hope Kurt settles down and changes his views. \n\n>They didn\u2019t have much of a reaction to the talk we had, so we\u2019re still trying to figure out how they feel. \n\nAnd that you figure stuff out with the girls. Are either of them friends with anyone in Kurt's friend group? Or an older sibling? Might help, idk.\n\n>during my oldest\u2019s spring break so we\u2019re currently spending time with him. \n\nDid any of the other kids get upset with him? He was so responsible coming to you, I was really worried this might damage his relationship with Kurt/the girls!\n\nAnyway, it sounds like you're making good progress. I'm glad!", "Sounds like you are headed in the right direction.", "Make sure to circle back to Kurt.  You expect him to be able to really see the gravity of his behavior and then with appropriate amends he is welcome back.  Otherwise it might just entrench him even more in the toxic ideology.", "You're heading in the right direction but still missing some critical points. You explained to the girls that Kurt's comments \"really hurt Brecken\" but not that they were racist and homophobic and wrong/vile. \n\nYTA for still not taking what Kurt said as seriously as you should have.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It could be something like a need to feel powerful or manly, or like he fits in with a group, or from a desire to be seen as special or \"better\" than others.\nUnless you figure that out and fill the hole, it won't be fixed and Kurt will remain drawn to such rhetoric.", "The girls come across to me, as agreeing with Kurts view and do not see Racism ot Homophobia as a big deal. There needs to be alot more work done within this family. Only one who seemed to have really taken it seriously is the oldest son."]}
