I called the building security officer but the neighbor refused to answer the door or turn down the music.  The building security officer just left, so I called the cops.  \n\nThe neighbor and I ran into each other the next day and he apologized, claiming he did this all the time but had never had a noise complaint.  He gave me his phone number and told me to text him if there\u2019s an issue again.   The next weekend the same thing happened, but this time it was ~11pm.  I texted him and explained that the bass goes right thru the wall and politely asked if he could turn down the music.  He didn\u2019t respond until the next day and claimed he was letting a friend use his apartment. \n\nNow it\u2019s the following weekend. Last night the music and lights started around 7pm.  I had all of my windows closed, put headphones on, but the bass cut thru it all.  I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s home or if someone else is using his place.  So at about 830pm I called the non emergency line and reported the noise.  Two cops showed up about an hour later.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698596363, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j6eon/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_my_neighbor_due_to/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it's an apartment and you're renting, I would contact building management. I'm skeptical about his claim \"someone else\" was using the apt. Shouldn't they be told about the noise issue as well? And likely where you live there is a noise ordinance (where I live it's 10 pm to 7 am). So mention that to building management as well.", "You let him know and he gave you a line of communication that went nowhere. What are you left to do? He should expect this if he isnt actually going to play ball with you. NTA. \n\nPs. Whats the apt number? Sounds fun", "NTA. Try contacting the property manager. First write them a formal email and take quotes directly from your lease about quiet hours, misconduct, etc. and give them the apartment number. Tell them you expect them to take action, but be nice about it. Send it in the afternoon so you can immediately call them afterwards and notify them that you sent an email. Call them everyday until they give a response. It sounds annoying but these big property managers will either ignore or not even open it for weeks.", "An awesome party happens next door every weekend and you\u2019re not going? If you can\u2019t beat \u2018em\u2026\n\nOk, kidding. You tried building security, you tried going straight to the source, what options did you have left? None.

If it's really a \"luxury highrise\" you would think that the property management would be on top of situations like this.  \n\nNTA and document it all in case you need to present your side of the story.", "NTA. This guy knows what he's doing, doesn't care, and is gaslighting you. Call every time. If he doesn't stop, eventually he'll risk eviction.", "NTA. There are some standard rules for living in places with shared walls and hosting a rager or rave or whatever every weekend with music that can be heard in other people's units violates all of them. If building authorities couldn't intervene then the police were the only viable option. It's definitely also time to talk directly to building management about it.", "NTA you tried the right avenues first before escalating.", "NTA\n\nIf it was a one off it would be one thing but this is a regular thing.", "NTA - after 10pm on weekdays and 11pm- Midnight on weekends should be somewhat quiet. You pay to live there and deserve the right of enjoyment. If the building management won\u2019t handle it (warnings and ending his lease), you can either move or call the police. Maybe some fines for disturbing the peace might help bring it under control.", "NTA. If the party happens every once in a while, that's fine. But if it becomes a norm, it is more than reasonable to complain.", "Actually, no, not at all because if you called your neighbour a few times and he/she did nothing about it, you have the full-on right to call the police.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You actually were pretty nice about it the first few times, now it's time to rachet up the level of complaints.  Yes, file a complaint with the actual site manager and quote the verbiage in the lease about excess noise.  Most apartments rarely let it go past 11pm but I'm sure there are exceptions.  This is unacceptable, you pay your rent, you deserve some late night quiet.  NTA.", "NTA. People with shared walls have to be considerate of others. Your neighbor is an asshole.", "NTA. If this was something that happened a couple of times a year and he warned you beforehand you could maybe be graceful about it, but every weekend?

He knows what he\u2019s trying to do", "NTA- I am having the same issues with my downstairs neighbor. I live in an older building and have never had an issue in the 3 years I have been here.
