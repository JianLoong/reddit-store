I called the building security officer but the neighbor refused to answer the door or turn down the music.  The building security officer just left, so I called the cops.  \n\nThe neighbor and I ran into each other the next day and he apologized, claiming he did this all the time but had never had a noise complaint.  He gave me his phone number and told me to text him if there\u2019s an issue again.   The next weekend the same thing happened, but this time it was ~11pm.  I texted him and explained that the bass goes right thru the wall and politely asked if he could turn down the music.  He didn\u2019t respond until the next day and claimed he was letting a friend use his apartment. \n\nNow it\u2019s the following weekend. Last night the music and lights started around 7pm.  I had all of my windows closed, put headphones on, but the bass cut thru it all.  I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s home or if someone else is using his place.  So at about 830pm I called the non emergency line and reported the noise.

If it's an apartment and you're renting, I would contact building management. I'm skeptical about his claim \"someone else\" was using the apt. Shouldn't they be told about the noise issue as well? And likely where you live there is a noise ordinance (where I live it's 10 pm to 7 am). So mention that to building management as well.", "You let him know and he gave you a line of communication that went nowhere. What are you left to do? He should expect this if he isnt actually going to play ball with you. NTA. \n\nPs. Whats the apt number? Sounds fun", "NTA. Try contacting the property manager. First write them a formal email and take quotes directly from your lease about quiet hours, misconduct, etc. and give them the apartment number. Tell them you expect them to take action, but be nice about it. Send it in the afternoon so you can immediately call them afterwards and notify them that you sent an email. Call them everyday until they give a response. It sounds annoying but these big property managers will either ignore or not even open it for weeks.", "An awesome party happens next door every weekend and you\u2019re not going?

If it's really a \"luxury highrise\" you would think that the property management would be on top of situations like this.  \n\nNTA and document it all in case you need to present your side of the story.", "NTA. This guy knows what he's doing, doesn't care, and is gaslighting you. Call every time. If he doesn't stop, eventually he'll risk eviction.", "NTA. There are some standard rules for living in places with shared walls and hosting a rager or rave or whatever every weekend with music that can be heard in other people's units violates all of them. If building authorities couldn't intervene then the police were the only viable option. It's definitely also time to talk directly to building management about it.", "NTA you tried the right avenues first before escalating.", "NTA\n\nIf it was a one off it would be one thing but this is a regular thing.", "NTA - after 10pm on weekdays and 11pm- Midnight on weekends should be somewhat quiet. You pay to live there and deserve the right of enjoyment. If the building management won\u2019t handle it (warnings and ending his lease), you can either move or call the police. Maybe some fines for disturbing the peace might help bring it under control.", "NTA. If the party happens every once in a while, that's fine. But if it becomes a norm, it is more than reasonable to complain.", "Actually, no, not at all because if you called your neighbour a few times and he/she did nothing about it, you have the full-on right to call the police.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You actually were pretty nice about it the first few times, now it's time to rachet up the level of complaints.  Yes, file a complaint with the actual site manager and quote the verbiage in the lease about excess noise.  Most apartments rarely let it go past 11pm but I'm sure there are exceptions.  This is unacceptable, you pay your rent, you deserve some late night quiet.  NTA.", "NTA. People with shared walls have to be considerate of others. Your neighbor is an asshole.", "NTA. If this was something that happened a couple of times a year and he warned you beforehand you could maybe be graceful about it, but every weekend? If he wants to do that he can go live in the middle of the woods where no one'll hear.", "NTA. I would do the exact same thing. He knows what he\u2019s trying to do", "NTA- I am having the same issues with my downstairs neighbor. I live in an older building and have never had an issue in the 3 years I have been here. But this guy is driving me nuts. Sometimes it\u2019s midnight, 5 am, 2 pm. I have tried being nice. Next is the office and security then it will be the cops. While I\u2019m not the type I like my sleep.", "NTA. Not sure if you\u2019re in the US so if not disregard. Keep calling and make sure to give the address every time. If a house gets tons of calls it will get designated a \u201cparty house\u201d and they will be VERY strict about shutting it down.", "Next time throw in \u201cI seems like they are using narcotics as well\u201d while calling the police.", "It's clearly not a high end building with such shitty insulation. \n\nNothing the cops can do really here... \n\nYou should probably look into moving,  but nta", "NTA\n\ncall every time on this dipshit.  also complain in writing to your LL every time.\n\ncheck your state laws. failure of the LL to enforce their rules can void your lease or give you a right to withhold rent in certain areas (obviously be very sure about this and consult a lawyer)", "Sounds like someone asking to end up evicted by the landlord eventually.", "NTA.  Yikes.  What a nightmare neighbor.  Reading your story gives me anxiety.", "NTA. He gave you his number and asked to call him first. You did that, too which he didn't reply, so now you call the cops first. You gave him a chance, he immediately screwed it up for himself.", "NTA - anytime music is *that* loud it's unacceptable. There's absolutely no reason for it at any time of day or night. Repeatedly doing that is even worse. Call the cops every time.", "That's a tough one. The later ones you were NTA. The earlier one... It was a normal time to have a party. But having the bass booming thru your apartment was a problem. If they will turn down the bass and stop earlier then it might be okay. But if not then you would NTA for calling the cops. You aren't paying rent to deal with your neighbors.", "NTA, I'm guessing he's using this apartment as a rental for income. Keep calling the police, contact the apartment and see if he actually lives there.", "NTA.  I'm also surprised the other neighbors aren't complaining.\n\nSince the possibility of it being a short-term rental has been brought up, you might want to check VRBO and AirBnB to see if you can find it listed.", "100% NTA.

I learned the hard way that being nice about it and putting up with it etc\u2026 gets you nowhere\u2026 A noise violation fine speaks louder than empty promises.", "NTA.  Um, what does your lease say about noise and parties?  You need to notify property management and/or your landlord as well.  Let them know you\u2019ve had to call the police a few times.  This is asinine.", "No you are not especially if it\u2019s every weekend.", "NTA, the guy sounds like he is messing with you and is giving you BS excuses.", "NTA. Most apartments and high rise condos have quiet hours usually 10/11pm to 6/7am. Those our the hours most residents will be sleeping. If he or his \"friends\" who borrow his place cannot follow the rules then they can deal with a noise complaint and ticket.", "Also will add that luxury buildings are very clear about not allowing tenants to airbnb/vrbo.  \n\nIf his \"friend\" is an airbnb tenant management will drop the hammer.", "Very true, I hadn't considered that. The vacation rentals I've stayed at have also been pretty clear about renters having to be quiet \u2014 or else."]}
