The estimated date of birth is in mod December so it's still early and I have been given medication, allowed to go home, however I am to mostly lay down and not walk around if not necessary. Daughter knows all of that and usually is considerate \n\n\nMy daughter has Kung Fu every Thursday. The arrangement is her school gives her notice when she is supposed to leave, she goes to the school bus, school bus takes her to practice, she is picked up by my husband when done. Today however both her and her teacher forgot. I found out because I always call her when she is supposed to be on the bus to make sure everything is ok. Well she forgot, things happen, no Biggie. I told her to be waiting and ready, as I am getting to my car now and will be there in 6 minutes to pick her up. I arrive at school, no kid at the entrance. I try to call and call - she doesn't pick up her phone. So I get out of the car and waddle around the school. She decided she still has time to go to the playground at the very back of the school to play with her friends and is not even slightly packed up (Backback and sportsgear still inside school). While she gets her stuff and packs up, I wait and my cramps start again ( yippieh:/ ) \nBy the time she returns I am quite annoyed as we still have to go all the way around the school to the front where the car is. She looks at her watch and tells me to hurry up. Now, usually that would be no big deal, however walking means pain right now -> So she gets an earful. About how I told her to be waiting, which she wasn't. She was supposed to be ready and also wasn't. Also she knows I am supposed to lie down, yet still decides it's ok to make me circle her school because she'd rather have some more playtime instead of waiting in the front. If I or anybody helps her out, she should make it easier on the person helping and never harder then it needs to be. Then again why am I supposed to rush and get into more pain because she decided to not be ready and prepared and instead go to the playground, so I have to look for her and walk while she knows I shouldn't be. I also think the very least she could do were to say sorry, which she didn't. I still drove her to practice though and she was silent on the way there. Hubs says she is 8, she is allowed to sometimes forget things and it's hard for 8 year olds to be empathetic. So AITA? Is she just being typical 8 year old or can I expect some more empathy from her?\n\n\nEdit: a few actually. I read all your comments and thought about them while she was still in practice. I am grateful for your advice and insight and some of you have have given me a lot by their words. I thank you a lot and probably will reread your advice from time to time, as I think it is valuable beyond this instance. I maybe need to mention that I am not a native speaker so I maybe did pick the wrong expression. 'I gave her an earful' would translate for us into I gave her a longer talk. I didn't yell nor was I aggressive. I did say word for word 'I am annoyed about you being not ready and waiting.' and then explained why (pain walking). Yelling is kept for emergencies and immediate danger (like car approaching and kids not paying attention). Second we are in rural Germany. Kids here grow up different compared to e.g. us. It is expected of them to get to primary school by themselves. In her class we were kind of late bloomers in terms of allowing her to go by herself. Right now she is in a class of 24 kids, of which 3 get picked up and dropped off. The rest walks, rides a bike or takes the school bus. Teachers will approach you a lot of you don't let them. also the kids don't go alone alone. Just without parents. Usually they meet or pick each other up and then go together. Criminal rates here are on a very different level then in other parts of the world. \nNext point: \nSome of you called my child a brat or self centered and entitled. She is not. She is allowed to make mistakes and I am supposed to help her to learn to not make mistakes. Doesn't make her a brat. \nLastly : we talked. She said sorry for not listening and told me she heard me, she knew she was supposed to be at the gate and start packing instantly- but hoped she still had a few minutes left for play and then lost track of time because she just had so much fun. We compromised on her trusting her wrist watch more next time meaning packing, then checking if there is time left and not the other way round. I told her sorry, too and used the insight some of you were generous to share with me. We hugged it out. I also mentioned how pregnancy is neither her fault not responsibility - she responded 'ohana' (reference to a movie we all love) and that made me laugh out loud and her giggle.\n\n\nSecond edit: she has a wrist watch. She is able to set alarms on it. She usually does it but gut distracted because she had fun.

She was an AH, an 8 year old was given very specific instructions that they did not follow, caused you pain as a result.  \n\nTell her Senpai69 says she was an AH for not waiting where she was directed to wait.", "NAH I think it helps kids to know when they mess up. You didn't yell, ground her or do anything besides state your feelings and the facts. Parents are allowed to have feelings and express them, we need to show our kids that we are human too. You could go to her now and apologize for being a bit a harsh and taking your frustration out on her. You could explain to her that you should have waited to talk to her when you weren't upset but the fact still stands that she didn't listen to you, caused you pain and was then rude to you.  Use this as a teachable moment that when someone is going out of their way to help you, you should make it as easy as possible to give that help.  Parents and kids mess up sometimes and we all need to own it and do better next time.", "NTA. You told her to be ready and waiting in six minutes. An eight-year-old understands time and should\u2019ve known she did not have enough time to go to the playground.", "NAH if you weren't yelling. Your daughter was given clear instructions and completely ignored them. This is quite understandable, because she's 8. However, just because it's understandable doesn't mean she shouldn't be in trouble for it. You scolded her basically, if I am interpreting the scene correctly.  Saying \"she got an earful\" is a little ambiguous, if it just means you lectured her/were clearly irritated then that's fine, if it means shouting or belittling then Y T A.", "NAH but maybe try to talk to her. Yes, she is a child, however, you can still try to explain to her why you were so upset. Sit down and talk to her", "As kindly as I can convey over reddit, yes YTA.\n\nI get that you're in a wild amount of pain and that makes everything infinitely harder than it needs to be. But your husband is right - she is 8 years old and sometimes she's going to forget things, or be a little self centered. It's natural, and honestly it would be more concerning if she never did.\n\nFrom what you've said, you've got a daughter that tries to be kind and considerate, is generally quite responsible, and all around seems to be a good kid. But she is still very young, and you can't hold her to adult standards. Berating her for what is, in the grand scheme, a relatively minor mistake is not going to do her or you any good. All that kind of thing will do is make her terrified of ever messing up, which is a bad road to go down. Far better to simply explain why you need her to listen to your instructions, and gently point out the consequences of her getting distracted.", "She's 8 years old.  They get distracted it happens.  I think due to you not feeling well you may have overacted a little bit.  I'm going with YTA a little bit.  Talk to your daughter calmly and explain again that mommy isn't feeling well and really need her rest.  It would be a great help to mommy if she can help out by doing the things she suppose to do.", "Nta you didn't scream or hit her or refuse to drive her. You weren't abusive in any way. You told your daughter she was being inconsiderate. That seems totally appropriate to me. You were probably more angry and annoyed then you prefer to be when talking to your kid but like? Yeah you're a human being and imperfect.  I think you can apologize for your tone and still reinforce to her that it's important to be considerate of others. Also yes when someone does you a favor you should make the favor as easy as possible for the other person.", "Kinda NAH here.\n\nYour daughter is eight. Eight year-olds literally do not have the wiring hooked up in their brains yet to be really considerate all the time, and to the extent that they manage consideration, it is usually from having manners drilled into them, and not by exercising empathy for other human beings. While your daughter may know that it's important for you to be cautious, I had plenty of trouble with grown-ass adults in my life being clear on what \"caution\" consisted of when I was on bed rest with pregnancy complications, so asking a third grader to get it is a lot.\n\nThat said, being scolded for being inconsiderate is one way information gets through to kids, and if an awkward drive to kung fu practice is the worst that befalls her, that child has a blessed life.", "YTA.\n\n\nExpecting an 8 years old to \"accomodate\" you is just unreasonable. You're probably making her hate the baby before it's even there. You should have had backup for such emergencies if it's too much for you in your state. Like a babysitter or a nanny. **You** should be the one nurturing your very young daughter not the other way around. I think it's you who's only thinking of yourself here and not your daughter. The way you're acting might even make her think mommy doesn't love me as much anymore now that she's having another child coming.", "NTA - What she did is pretty normal for 8, but there's nothing wrong with telling her that it was inconsiderate. There's no magic age where it clicks for kids that they should take other people's needs and opinions into account, it just gradually builds over time.\n\nI think you should sit down with her and have a calm talk about how her actions impacted you. Try to find a parallel that she'll understand - like what if she needed to be somewhere and you told her you'd give her a ride, and instead went to take a nap. How would she feel?\n\nI think also the \"the right thing isn't always fun\" talk is a good one. It was more fun to play on the playground instead of being ready to go, but it wasn't the right thing. The older kids get, the more they need to learn to control that desire for immediate gratification.", "NTA. 8 is young but it's not incapable of empathy entirely, and even if it were, you were clear with your expectations that she chose not to pay attention to. She caused you pain and potentially put the baby at risk, and it's important that she be aware that her actions have consequences that harm others. If you didn't yell, I see absolutely nothing wrong with telling her she was wrong and caused harm.", "NTA, especially after the edit.\n\nYou were parenting your kid, guiding her so she knows what is and isn't acceptable. This is the only way she'll learn. Respect and compassion are taught. You're teaching her. If it makes her quiet, unhappy, and thoughtful now, in the long run it will serve her well to understand.", "YTA You're expecting your kid to have the emotional intelligence of an adult which is funny cause you've shown none.", "YTA - it seems to me that in all the commotion you're going through right now you forgot your daughter is 8, because yes, she's displaying normal 8 year old behaviour.", "[deleted]", "YTA. I understand you yourself are having a difficult time with issues related to your pregnancy. But you're asking your 8-year-old to fully understand this adult thing. You're not giving her the space to be 8 and make the mistakes of an 8 year old. Her behavior sounds pretty typical for that age. \n\nResearch would agree that at her age she has not yet developed the capacity for cognitive empathy so she can't see things from your perspective. What she likely sees is \"mom is mad and it's that baby's fault\"", "Yeah YTA. She's 8. You could have been 100x nicer about the situation. Kids aren't thinking about what's not in front of them like that. And after you rushed her, she gave it right back.", "I give my niece an earful pretty often when she acts up. Not yelling and screaming or being rash, I just tell her like it is. She's 9. I know she doesn't understand how life works yet so I try making things a realistic as I can for her. Especially when I start my period, the first day is terrible cramps, I can't even get out of bed on the first day most times. She's found me on my kitchen floor laying down crying a few times from how bad the pain is. It's only the first day, the rest of the week I'm 100%. But I know that she doesn't understand that yet. Your daughter doesn't understand your pain, she hears it but she can't understand it. Has she had any major injuries? Sprained wrist or burns, or maybe cuts that needed stitches? If so, try comparing it to that. \"listen kiddo, remember when you fell down at the play ground and twisted you wrist and it hurt ALOT, you needed a cast on for a few... Weeks? (idk how long you were a cast lol) remember how much is hurt and you cried everyday, that's kinda what mommy is dealing it but in my belly with the new baby\"\nDon't feel like a bad mom, you're super pregnant and that comes with alot of baggage (EMOTIONS) you're absolutely allowed to get frustrated and yell. People yell at kids everyday for far less. She should have absolutely been ready and waiting but in her mind 6 mins might be 6 hours. Kids just don't think sometimes.", "It is normal to tell her off. She needs to hear when she misbehaves, and even moms are not always calm and sweet :-)\n\nIt is normal for an 8 y o to be quiet when told off. She was probably embarrassed because she realized that you were right, and that she did something she should not have done.\n\nIt is also normal for an 8 y o to forget things and be thoughtless sometimes. She probably didnt do any of it on purpose.\n\nNAH and good luck w the new baby!", "YTA.  Because you gave an earful rather than a measured response.  Your husband is right, but you are right that she needs to be taught things as well.  Much of your reaction was because of how you were feeling.\n\nWhat message do you think your daughter was left with?  Mommy is mad at me.  Mommy isn\u2019t feeling well.  Mommy yelled at me.  Mommy doesn\u2019t like me. Mommy doesn\u2019t think I am a good person.\n\nOr, I need to think about how my decisions impact other people?  And try to be more thoughtful.", "She 8 .. only 8 she still a child she still learning.. \n\nNot one of us can say at 8 they wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing \ud83d\ude44. \n\nNow I\u2019m sorry your hurting and I hope you feel better but again she only 8 she still a child that\u2019s want to be a kid and play with her friends and not have her phone stuck in face or a tablet..", "NTA.  You told her to wait somewhere for you to pick her up and she did not.  This time she just wandered to the playground, but could have been a lot worse if she wondered off of school grounds and ended up getting kidnapped or something.  it is important for her to learn that if she is supposed to meet you somewhere, then she should be there to meet you and not off doing something else.", "NTA\n\nIf you weren\u2019t yelling and this was a calm conversation, it\u2019s a learning moment for her. I still remember being that age and my mom was in an accident and I had to have a similar conversation. It wasn\u2019t fun as a kid but it was like the first time I remember trying to put myself in someone shoes. As long as the convo was calm and there is still love and care it\u2019s fine.", "YTA.  She's 8.  8 year olds forget things, and get distracted, and make choices that adults wouldn't make.  She's learning.   Developmentally, her brain is nowhere near the point where she consistently will think in the ways you're expecting her to.   You can explain to her how her decisions affect others, and how it is important to be mindful of what is expected or asked of her, but you can't expect her to think in a way that an adult thinks.", "YTA. She\u2019s 8. They get distracted and mistakes happen. That sucks your are in so much pain but it was your choice to have a baby and to deal with all that.

She\u2019s a kid", "Ehhhh she is allowed to forget things we all do however she didn\u2019t forget. She literally just talked with you and knew she was supposed to be waiting out front for you. She made a decision that she should go play instead of doing as told so your husband\u2019s point about that is kind of mute.

Do you really think an 8 yr old knows when 6 minutes are up? Kids that age live in the moment and they should. You are clearly projecting your anxiety on to your kid.

A good consequence for forgetting to get on the bus is, she misses class that day.", "ESH, leaning close to YTA. She is 8, so forgetting things is expected. Her stating that you need to hurry might have been an attempt to lighten the mood, but might genuinely have been her noticing time. It makes sense, to me, that if she was on the playground that she wouldn't look at time or notice; the old adage of \"Time flies by when you're having fun\". However, you implied she has a watch so she did indeed have a method of time keeping, and her bags were not packed and ready.\n\nI would sit down and apologize for anything said that was uncalled for, apologize for some unreasonable expectations.

Is this normal or should I have that checked out? Her pediatrician and teachers said it's normal, but I sometimes doubt it when I repeat myself over and over again.

That's how kids feel and think. If there's a tangible shift in the way they're treated they'll think you love them less. Like how often did you chew up her ears for mistakes before?

Being told that she should somehow not have the limitations of a normal 8 year old causes a lot of stress for kids - and it erodes their self worth. \n\nPlease educate yourself so you can be more reasonable in the future.

I did ask her if she is afraid or anything like that some time ago. She said she just needs time to think it through and does not want to be rushed into an answer. So it's usually like that. Me 'you did X,y,z' her: -  \nThen some time later 'mom, I thought about it and ...' \n\nThanks for your input, well appreciated", "That would be a lot of bad intent she is probably incapable off. Maybe because I am 'mom', maybe it's even true but I think she has no malicious intent. She is just a little easy to distract sometimes. \nI made this post because I was unsure if I expected too much of her and to that I got a response.", "I know she is 8, I know I expected too much of her in thinking about why it was important to do what I asked her to (here I see my mistake) - but still if I as a mom tell her she should do something and she doesn't then I have to react and explain why I wanted her to do what I told her to do.", "You mention that she likes wearing a watch. Is it possible to get watch that will connect to her phone and set an alarm for the time she needs to leave for the bus? They make some for kids at a fairly decent price and you might be able to get one with swappable bands so she can still match with her outfit.", "Probably. But as mentioned above it was an honest mistake. She is usually capable of doing that she just decided / hoped she had a moment left to play. We already talked it through and next time she will start off with the duty (gathering her stuff) and then check if she has time left for fun (like playground)"]}
