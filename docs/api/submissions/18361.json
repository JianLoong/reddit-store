Are you actually hoping for an apology (an admission that a wrong has been committed, that your girlfriend was at \u201cfault\u201d) or were you hoping that she was actually sorry (going deeper into what this means, that she expresses regret/ displays empathy for the loss of something that held value to you)?\n\nBased on what you say, it sounds like you were hoping for the latter. And fwiw I agree that\u2019s completely reasonable. But it\u2019s possible that what she has understood is that you want an apology (for something ultimately she didn\u2019t forsee and when both of you were fine with the can stored where it was for ages), which in turn made her defensive. Then in the heat of discussion this nuance got lost and now you\u2019re both not talking.\n\nOr maybe I\u2019ve completely misread the situation \ud83d\ude05 but wanted to throw that perspective in just in case it was helpful.", "NTA. Of course, no one expected the can to leak and this was an accident. But you know what? When you're cohabitating with someone and you ruin one of their belongings, you apologize.

Please think about how she treats you in other areas of the relationship. Does she often disrespect you?", "NTA unfortunately I know what it is like to expect and never receive an apology because the person in question \"didn't mean for it to happen\".", "NTA. Common decency means that when something you are responsible for is responsible for damaging someone else's stuff, you have a sense of remorse that you express as an apology.

You both seem stubborn and this may be about more than the book.", "NTA she should replace the book", "NAH/ESH I think this is kinda petty. You could let it go.

But I think expecting the second type in this situation is too much, and asking her to take personal responsibility for manufacturing processes and temperature.", "YTA. It's not like either of you expected the can to leak. Everyone was okay with the can being on the shelf. I would call this an accident but that would imply that someone actually has responsibility here, and I'm not convinced anyone does.

HOWEVER, it is understandable that you would be upset and at least want to talk about those feelings. She was dismissive about something that\u2019s important to you, and that\u2019s not cool.\nHowever, based on how you presume to know how she would react if the roles were reversed, it sounds like this isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened. \n\nIf you both want the relationship to last then get over yourselves, go to therapy, and work on communicating more effectively about values and expectations.

Emotional intelligence skills takes time and practice to develop, this is a good opportunity for you to understand and articulate your feelings, and for her to learn to empathize.\n\nThis \"bullshit\" is worth it if she wants a happy partner. The way she handled it is maybe how she would react if one of her books got damaged, maybe she doesn't care about her books, but this isn't about her or how she would react, it's about you and how you want to be comforted.

Moving forward, the two of you should refrain from placing containers of liquids on any bookcase. NTA.", "NTA\n\nSounds to me like your gf lacks basic empathy? She isn't responsible for your book being damaged. A can, leaking? I'd never bet money on a can spontaneously leaking. Completely unpredictable. But, if a can I left out leaked, not only would I insist on cleaning the mess, but I'd make right anything caused by this incident. It's just the decent thing to do.", "Yo the apology doesn't always mean \"I accept blame\", it also means \"I regret what happened\" or \"I sympathise with you\". Maybe she only understands the first meaning.", "I would have expected the can of drink to be put on a proper surface like a coffee or side table placed on a coaster. Your GF does not care about your book just like she\u2019s careless on where she put the can!", "Back before we were married, my wife put a glass of ice water on my computer desk because it was a hot day. I was outside doing something, but when I got back, the condensation from the glass had made a small puddle and dripped down into my gaming keyboard on the pull-out shelf below, ruining 1/4 of the keys. \n\nI was frustrated, but knew it wasn't on purpose, so I told her what had happened and she was incredibly apologetic right away. I had a backup keyboard, so it was fine, but I was bummed out because that one had RGB lights and stuff. \n\nThat Christmas, one of my gifts from her was an even nicer gaming keyboard than the one I had before. I absolutely loved it and I still use it years later. \n\nNTA, the right thing would have been to validate you for being unhappy, apologize, then try to replace it.", "I think a lot of people are missing a key fact here : how is she more to blame here than you are? You put the book under it and you also could have moved the can. You\u2019re wanting her to apologise for not having foresight yet neither did you.\n\nI, personally, apologise for things like this but not a long winded one. I\u2019d be like \u201coh my god, I\u2019m so sorry that\u2019s happened\u201d but I wouldn\u2019t be forced to take blame nor would I go about replacing your book either. She sympathised with you but that wasn\u2019t enough and you went away and sat on this, going back and fourth in your head, brought it up and then made the situation worse. \n\nShe\u2019s to blame just as much as you are yet you\u2019re so he\u2019ll bent on blaming someone, I\u2019m hoping you aren\u2019t causing this purely because you want HER to pay for a new book, that you\u2019re letting this anger cause tension in your relationship.\n\nShe\u2019s right, is this really a hill you want to die on? Because if so, that\u2019s petty. You shouldn\u2019t have left your book under the can if she shouldn\u2019t have put the van there. Even though you were perfectly capable of moving the can too.", "Let's see here; she made a decision that ended up damaging your property. She was nonchalant about it. You calmly brought up your concern about her attitude and expressed how you feel. She disregarded your feelings and called them bullshit. And she has not apologized. \n\nOP you are absolutely NTA and she absolutely would have blown a fuse on you if the rollers reversed. Stand your ground and stand up for yourself. This is a matter of principle and respect. She does not respect you", "Sorry, dude. You\u2019re definitely overreacting. She didn\u2019t do it on purpose. Granted, it sucks, but unless this is a first edition, it\u2019s a book. Is a $20 paperback really worth more to you than she is?", "Is it a rare book?  If not, get over it.  I'm not going to say YTA, but....", "NTA.\n\nMy books are super important to me, some are from my childhood, and I'd be upset like OP.\n\nAlthough it's not the gf's actual fault, the can is there because it's hers and she could've apologised. She's disrespectful to OP.", "NTA she\u2019s right that this is relatively minor but you may want to pay attention to what this means about how she respects you and your property. For something so minor, why is it so difficult for her to make it right?", "I'm on the fence. The problem is that she doesn't register the book as important. She's right that it was an accident, an unanticipated incident. I'd recommend not yielding to an impulse to do some damage to something of hers. If you start feeling that way, just break up and stay away from her.", "\"I didn't mean to do it, why should I apologize?\" Well if you only apologize for things you meant to do, what is the point of an apology?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen things happen out of everyone's control, you still apologize, because you're supposedly sorry that it happened: it doesn't matter if you specifically did anything or not, it means \"I am sorry this happened and if I had the chance, I wish it didn't happen.\" When you offer condoleances to someone it doesn't mean you killed the person that died. Apologizing for an unfortunate event shouldn't be hard, and the fact that she can't see this/can't muster the compassion for an event as \"unimportant\" as this doesn't bode well for bigger conflicts, harder events, or situations where someone is, in fact, at fault.  \n\n\nShe left her can next to your book, you left your book next to her can, noone thought it would leak. However, the fact that it's that hard for her to apologize for a minor event isn't reassuring. NTA", "Dude... NTA for this one, there's a number of things that could've been done:\n\n1. I agree that no-one expected the can yo leak, that was clearly an accident, BUT who stores beverages on a bookshelf? And for years?? She could've at least put it in a fridge or freezer. Or, better yet, emptied it out if she really wanted to store it in a visible place. Why even store the drink itself for that long?\n\n2. Even so, accident or not, saying sorry costs nothing. I assume you didn't even ask her to replace the book since you didn't mention it, so the least she could've done is apologize for it. Is it her fault the can leaked? No, of course not, BUT she is the one who chose to store it next to your books.\n\n3. Not to be mean over here, but if this is how she acts when a small issue arises, then I can imagine how she reacts to bigger ones. I'd be careful if I were you, I don't know you or how your relationship has been so far, but this small incident got me thinking about what kind of person she might be...", "Omg, I had this discussion with my son when he was about 8...when something happens due to something you did accidentally, you apologize. Because it happened because of your doing. So you are responsible.\n\nNearly no one sits in their car thinking \"today I will crash someone's car\". But when the accident happens the one whose actions where the reason for it is accountable. It is their responsibility to make good on it.", "I think it's one of those Coke cans we're they had peoples names on it . People just kept it without opening.", "This. If something of mine ruins something of yours, even unintentionally,  I apologize and replace your item. THIS IS THE HE WAY!!! NTA.", "Can we be sure it was the can of Coke that started it? The book might've attacked the can. \n\nIs the /s needed?", "I would have immediately offered to replace it as soon as I can. If you damage other people\u2019s property, whether it\u2019s intentional or not, you need to replace it and apologize. What\u2019s the big deal?", "NTA but I'm betting this isn't just about the book, OP.\n\nThis feels more like she could have a history of deprioritizing you and ignoring your feelings. Does she?", "#NTA", "If she didnt expect a soda can to leak, she didn't do the bare minimum of a 3 second google search. Soda cans are pressurized, made of the thinnest aluminum possible, and have intentional weak points to allow for easy opening. They eventually leak. Some earlier than others, but I think this has to be a warning to others, if you have a saved unopened can of soda, it might leak. The people who collect cans drain them from the bottom", "I couldn\u2019t agree more. I can\u2019t believe people are just disregarding the fact she has no remorse, sympathy, or empathy for his possessions. That\u2019s a HUGE red flag imo", "Right?

Good question! The gf did \"express pity.\" I wonder what that entailed? Perhaps to the gf that was an apology, like the first example you give- and then to OP, it didn't count?", "Yeah, I agree. I think this is being made into a way bigger issue than it needs to be and that's part of the reason the gf has gotten defensive. He expects some kind of a groveling admission of guilt when this was literally just an accident that happened. It sucks that a book got messed up but if it wasn't a limited edition copy, first edition, or signed...move on lol this shit happens. Id hate to see this guy have a toddler around lol", "Personally feel like she even skimped out on the first type of apology. 'what a pity' sounds so careless and 'oh well not my issue'.", "She should have expressed regret that Something he clearly valued was damage, possibly destroyed or at least greatly diminished in value.\n\ntaking responsibility is appropriate- she decided to store a can of carbonated batter acid next to paper.  It could easily have been anticipated that this would happen.  She could have offered to replace the damaged book.", "Completely agree. Additionally OP knew the can of coke is in there, they both didn\u2019t anticipate what could happen and he was okay with the can being there for years. If he felt it could damage his books, I am sure he would have moved it, so there is no reason for her to anticipate something would happen as well. \n\nWhat happened is unfortunate but I would just say \u201cI am sorry that happened to your book\u201d", "But what if you allowed her to store a soda can on one of those shelves for a few years? Wouldn't you have a share in the blame? It's no one's fault and they are both being petty.", "I think he\u2019s more upset about how dismissive his girlfriend seems to be about the whole thing.
