Are you actually hoping for an apology (an admission that a wrong has been committed, that your girlfriend was at \u201cfault\u201d) or were you hoping that she was actually sorry (going deeper into what this means, that she expresses regret/ displays empathy for the loss of something that held value to you)?\n\nBased on what you say, it sounds like you were hoping for the latter. And fwiw I agree that\u2019s completely reasonable. But it\u2019s possible that what she has understood is that you want an apology (for something ultimately she didn\u2019t forsee and when both of you were fine with the can stored where it was for ages), which in turn made her defensive. Then in the heat of discussion this nuance got lost and now you\u2019re both not talking.\n\nOr maybe I\u2019ve completely misread the situation \ud83d\ude05 but wanted to throw that perspective in just in case it was helpful.", "NTA. Of course, no one expected the can to leak and this was an accident. But you know what? When you're cohabitating with someone and you ruin one of their belongings, you apologize.

Please think about how she treats you in other areas of the relationship. Does she often disrespect you?", "NTA unfortunately I know what it is like to expect and never receive an apology because the person in question \"didn't mean for it to happen\".", "NTA. Common decency means that when something you are responsible for is responsible for damaging someone else's stuff, you have a sense of remorse that you express as an apology.

You both seem stubborn and this may be about more than the book.", "NTA she should replace the book", "NAH/ESH I think this is kinda petty. You could let it go.

I assume you knew this was  einf displayed near your books and weren't bothered until it leaked - you're jointly responsible for the damage.", "INFO: Would a \"I'm sorry that happened to your book\" apology have been ok for you, or were you expecting more of a \"I'm sorry I did something wrong that caused this\" apology? \n\nI personally think the first 'apology' (it isn't one really) is warranted in this case and I question people who can't give it, it indicates to me a sheer lack of empathy. But I think expecting the second type in this situation is too much, and asking her to take personal responsibility for manufacturing processes and temperature.", "YTA. It's not like either of you expected the can to leak. Everyone was okay with the can being on the shelf. I would call this an accident but that would imply that someone actually has responsibility here, and I'm not convinced anyone does.

HOWEVER, it is understandable that you would be upset and at least want to talk about those feelings. She was dismissive about something that\u2019s important to you, and that\u2019s not cool.\nHowever, based on how you presume to know how she would react if the roles were reversed, it sounds like this isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened. \n\nIf you both want the relationship to last then get over yourselves, go to therapy, and work on communicating more effectively about values and expectations.

If you ruin something, even by accident, you apologize *and* replace the thing you ruined. Your girlfriend owes you both that apology and replacements for the books her soda ruined.

Emotional intelligence skills takes time and practice to develop, this is a good opportunity for you to understand and articulate your feelings, and for her to learn to empathize.\n\nThis \"bullshit\" is worth it if she wants a happy partner. The way she handled it is maybe how she would react if one of her books got damaged, maybe she doesn't care about her books, but this isn't about her or how she would react, it's about you and how you want to be comforted.

(This involved driving all over Orange and LA county) \n\nI sewed the fabric in horizontal panels with elastic to gather it at the bottom, and I paired it with a black,velvet long sleeved mini dress with black tights and heels.
