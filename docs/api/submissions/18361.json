This morning I discovered that the can had started to leak (most likely due to temperature variations I'd assume) and while cleaning it up I noticed that one of my books is ruined.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I showed my girlfriend the leak and the damage on the book she basically said \"what a pity\". I didn't press the subject immediately but a few hours later I told her it would have been nice to hear her say that she is sorry that my book is ruined. She refused to and claims it is not her fault as she could not have expected the can to start leaking. I kinda agree in the sense that I would not have expected the can to start leaking either but I just know that if the situation would be reversed and something I owned somehow damaged one of her books I would be mortified and thinking very hard about how I could replace the book or otherwise make it up to her. When I told her so she let me know that she thinks I'm out of my mind if I expect an apology for what happened.\r  \n\r  \nI am aware that this is a minor issue but I'm annoyed at how she completely refused to see my point of view. Since she was not receptive at all I told her we would talk about it later and she said something along the lines of \"Let's not, it's not worth it for this bullshit\". \n\nNow I'm even more pissed off and we're not on speaking terms right now.

And then next to books? Also, why not replace it? \n\nAnd her \u201cit\u2019s not worth it for this bullshit\u201d shows what she thinks of your possessions/interests.", "NTA: 1) what kinda psycho stores a can of coke on a bookshelf? 2) if you ruin someone's property, even by accident, you apologize. ESPECIALLY if it's to a significant other who is upset. sounds like she is currently waving a red flag like shes charging into battle", "NTA but I think you both possibly have a different understanding of what an apology would mean and there might be more nuance to it. Are you actually hoping for an apology (an admission that a wrong has been committed, that your girlfriend was at \u201cfault\u201d) or were you hoping that she was actually sorry (going deeper into what this means, that she expresses regret/ displays empathy for the loss of something that held value to you)?\n\nBased on what you say, it sounds like you were hoping for the latter. And fwiw I agree that\u2019s completely reasonable. But it\u2019s possible that what she has understood is that you want an apology (for something ultimately she didn\u2019t forsee and when both of you were fine with the can stored where it was for ages), which in turn made her defensive. Then in the heat of discussion this nuance got lost and now you\u2019re both not talking.\n\nOr maybe I\u2019ve completely misread the situation \ud83d\ude05 but wanted to throw that perspective in just in case it was helpful.", "NTA. Of course, no one expected the can to leak and this was an accident. But you know what? When you're cohabitating with someone and you ruin one of their belongings, you apologize. Even when it's an accident. \n\nHer attitude shows a total lack of respect for you and your things. Do you really want to be with this person? Please think about how she treats you in other areas of the relationship. Does she often disrespect you?", "NTA unfortunately I know what it is like to expect and never receive an apology because the person in question \"didn't mean for it to happen\".", "NTA. Common decency means that when something you are responsible for is responsible for damaging someone else's stuff, you have a sense of remorse that you express as an apology. That doesn't mean an expression of liability, just respect.", "I'm so confused. What do you mean by 'storing' a can of coke for years on the bookshelf?", "NTA.\n\nYou might just be different -- you might be the type that says sorry all the time, and she the kind who thinks apologising often cheapens it.\n\nHowever, this was important to you. She decided it's just bs, but expects you to get over it rather than say sorry. You both seem stubborn and this may be about more than the book.", "NTA she should replace the book", "NAH/ESH I think this is kinda petty. You could let it go. She could say sorry to keep the peace.\n\nIt's not her fault it leaked. I assume you knew this was  einf displayed near your books and weren't bothered until it leaked - you're jointly responsible for the damage.", "INFO: Would a \"I'm sorry that happened to your book\" apology have been ok for you, or were you expecting more of a \"I'm sorry I did something wrong that caused this\" apology? \n\nI personally think the first 'apology' (it isn't one really) is warranted in this case and I question people who can't give it, it indicates to me a sheer lack of empathy. But I think expecting the second type in this situation is too much, and asking her to take personal responsibility for manufacturing processes and temperature.", "YTA. It's not like either of you expected the can to leak. Everyone was okay with the can being on the shelf. I would call this an accident but that would imply that someone actually has responsibility here, and I'm not convinced anyone does. Browbeating her over something *neither* of you knew could even happen is bizarre behavior and I would react like she did.", "Unless if you had an understanding that the coke can shouldn\u2019t be on your book in general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable for you to hold it against her.  I get why you\u2019re bothered but i don\u2019t think your being rational.  Light YTA.", "YTA - accidents happen.  Choose your battles more wisely if you want a long and happy relationship.", "YTA - this was a freak accident. You said she's been doing it for a few years and you had no problems with her doing it. Yet you expect her to apologise when you're both at equal fault for saying that was an okay stash place.", "You\u2019ve shared a home and a life with this woman for literal years, but you think of the items on your bookshelf as \u201cyours\u201d and \u201chers\u201d, and are vocally aggrieved that she does not? If she thinks of the items in your home as shared, \u201cwhat a pity\u201d is a very reasonable response to a book being damaged. YTA.", "ESH.\nIf you both agreed the book shelf was an appropriate place for an unopened can of soda then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable for you to EXPECT an apology from her. HOWEVER, it is understandable that you would be upset and at least want to talk about those feelings. She was dismissive about something that\u2019s important to you, and that\u2019s not cool.\nHowever, based on how you presume to know how she would react if the roles were reversed, it sounds like this isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened. \n\nIf you both want the relationship to last then get over yourselves, go to therapy, and work on communicating more effectively about values and expectations. If neither of you care enough to do that then don\u2019t be surprised if situations like these become more frequent and more severe. Like climate change. But for feelings.", "ESH", "YTA\n\nWhy should she apologize for an accident she was not involved in? It is not her fault that the can leaked. And starting to make this a problem hours after this minor accident happened is way beyond acceptable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are not unreasonable for expecting some basic respect for your property. Her inability to even apologise is poor", "NTA. Start treating her objects with the same amount of care so when you inevitably damage one just act the same way, do not apologize. In fact, call her crazy and laugh at her for insinuating you should. If she doesn\u2019t get the irony you should break up with her", "NTA. You still apologise for accidents that happened because of you, regardless of whether you expected it to happen.", "I think they meant like, displaying it. It was one of those \"share a Coke with [insert name]\" cans", "Exactly! If she spilled the drink accidentally then it would be proper to apologize because she would be responsible for the damage even if it was an accident. This isn\u2019t an accident. It is an act of nature. Something that just happened that she isn\u2019t really responsible for. Him wanting an apology means he blames her when she has no real fault.", "? NTA. She got defensive and said he wasn\u2019t even owed an apology. I get that it was an accident, but she should have apologized! Is that not basic politeness? She should have also offered to buy him a new copy. She just sounded like she didn\u2019t care about his book getting ruined at all. \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you spill milk all over your friend\u2019s carpet. You would try and clean it up right? You\u2019d apologize while cleaning and trying to get the milk out. You\u2019re trying to fix your mistake, even if it\u2019s an accident. \n\nShe showed no steps in trying to fix her mistake.

Don't push it though; mark it as a small red flag and start paying attention to other behaviours.", "Or maybe he just wants her to say sorry because it shows a shred of sympathy for an unfortunate situation, like a proper human would do? And her refusal is just her being a jerk?\n\nJesus christ I hope you don't expect sympathy from anyone when you have something unfortunate happen to you. Goodness knows it isn't their fault so they shouldn't have to say sorry.
