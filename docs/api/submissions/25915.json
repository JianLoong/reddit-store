I (16f) am the only one in the household who isn't talking about the wedding non-stop. My mom picked up on this a while ago and then she overheard me tell my friend I just wanted it to be over and that I wasn't excited for the wedding. So she asked if we could talk. It was a difficult conversation. I told my mom that I wasn't totally happy about the wedding, that it has been difficult for me, with dad, who died when I was 10, being gone and some things that have been said. I told her I was so glad she was happy and I know Charles helped bring her back to herself. The conversation highlighted that I don't see Charles and his kids as my family and that I'm unsure if I'll ever consider them in that way.\n\nSome (maybe) relevant info to some of my feelings: When Charles and his kids moved in first, he took me out for pizza and told me he doesn't want us to be a blended family, he wants us to be just a family. And he doesn't want to be my stepdad. He wants to be my dad. He said he would do everything for me that he does for his kids and would be there for me always. He said we could start trialing out some dad names for me to call him. I told him I already have a dad and the sentiment was nice and all but I was going to be his stepkid. He really challenged me on why I could only have one dad and why I didn't want one. It was very uncomfortable for me. He and his kids also tagged along when mom and I went to remember dad on his anniversary, at the diner we went to as a family. His kids talked non-stop about the wedding and we didn't actually get to talk about dad. Then Charles declared we'd make it a family thing every year and even when mom was like let's just see, he was like it will be good for bonding. I didn't like that at all. It was the first time where I went and did a solo thing to remember dad because I hated every second of the diner experience.\n\nMom wanted us to explore this in family therapy and I asked for it to be just her and me. She was going to say no and then she asked why. I told her I would open up more with just her and a therapist and that I would rather make sure we're okay, than work on trying to bond me to others right now. I told her I could see that she was hurting that I felt the way I do and I didn't want our relationship to be ruined by this. Mom agreed for therapy to be just me and her.\n\nWe start next week. But Charles doesn't like that I wanted it to be just mom and me. I think he was a little offended that I feel this way in the first place and then to not want to include him and his kids in family therapy. Mom told him she wished it could be all of us. But she didn't want to push me away or waste money by taking us all if I would find it difficult to open up around them. Charles told me I was putting my mom in a bad place and I was selfish and he has only ever tried to show me he loves me and will be my dad happily.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693469020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1664txg/aita_for_requesting_therapy_with_just_my_mom/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has kept on pushing and pushing which is ignoring your wishes. If he had any sense about him at all he would realise that pulling back and giving you your space is the best thing he could possibly do to try and form a legitimate relationship with you. By repeatedly trying to force it and by interjecting him and his kids into your things all he is doing is showing that he doesn't respect your boundaries at all. For a guy who wants to be your dad he is really struggling to act like a grown up.", "NTA\n\nCharles need to back off, you have told him how you feel and why you don't see / want him as your Dad.\n\nYou are obviously still grieving for your Dad.\n\nI don't think your Mum is getting how you feel and why you are upset, especially over the anniversary of your Dad, Charles and his kids should never have been involved in that.\n\nMake sure in therapy your Mum understands how you feel and why!", "NTA \n\nCharles is forcing himself on you even after you essentially told him to back off.

But also needs to respect the fact that it's totally ok for you and your mum to have alone time and things just between you two. \n\nIMO. I think you should think about introducing the rest of the family into Therapy at a later point when you and your mum have worked through some issues. \n\nIt does seem like he has your best interests at heart, but I totally agree that you should have this space for yourself for the time being.", "NTA. Charles needs to learn that not everything is about him. You want to do therapy with your mom because you recognise that something is fundamentally wrong between you and you need help processing and fixing it. Charles wants to do everything together because he has the skewed idea that because he's marrying your mom he slots right into your life.\n\nHonestly, your mom might be the biggest AH here. She *knows* Charles is upsetting you and she's letting it happen. Maybe it's what she wants as well, maybe because it's just easier to give in to what he wants. Therapy will help the two of you communicate, and it will tell you whether it's worth trying to save your relationship or whether your mother is picking the new family she's forming as a unit over you.", "NTA.

Charles needs to check him self.  Being some ones Dad is not a choice, its a bond you build over time by building trust. Not by overstepping your boundaries or having you use lables. He is the selfish one here because this is all about him. He wants to be your dad, he wants it to not be a blended family, he wants to be involved in your Dad's anniversery. There seems to be a theme there of him ignoring what other people want.  The fact that he thinks/pretends it was for you doesn't make it any less selfish since it seem he's made much effort to understand why some one might somethign different or respected that. Its not behaviour that build trust. That sounds less like love and more like obsession and a bit of a redflag.", "NTA Charles needs to know his place.

My stepmom was very similar to Charles. She never had children of her own and was constantly saying how my brother and I were her kids and would get furious with us when we\u2019d say, not mom, stepmom. We had a mom and she wasn\u2019t it.

Is Charles this controlling in other ways?", "There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, but first of all, NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re 16. That\u2019s a difficult age as it is. On top of that, you\u2019re getting a new house situation. You were an only child and you\u2019re suddenly getting 3 younger siblings (let\u2019s call them that, because that is the family dynamic you\u2019ll be in). It\u2019s a lot to deal with for you and it\u2019s normal that you need time to adjust. \n\nI\u2019m a child of divorce and have step siblings so I understand a bit of the new family situation. But you\u2019re not a child of divorce, your dad sadly passed. Big difference here and I\u2019m sorry for your loss! Charles was right to try and bond with you, but he\u2019s not right demanding you see him as a dad. He sounds a bit controlling. He should let the relationship evolve naturally, rather than trying to force it. \n\nI understand why you\u2019re not excited about the wedding. Is there any fear here that you might lose your mom to Charles in any way?\n\nThe day you remember your dad should just be about you and your mom. You need to be firm on that and they need to agree. You can have bonding with the new family literally any other day of the year. It doesn\u2019t need to be the day you remember your dad. \n\nYou can explore family therapy later on, but I would definitely start with just you and your mom. I think your mom might not see the issue between you and Charles and it can\u2019t be explored when he and his kids are present. You\u2019re very mature to even want to go to therapy with your mom. Charles has no say in who you go to therapy with, but to make him back off initially, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a start and maybe family therapy can be on the table later on. Whether or not that will be the case, is something that you will see after some therapy with just you and mom.

Like he thinks that if he's pushy enough, you'll fall in line. It's hard to verbalize what I'm feeling,  but a feeling of malaise popped up with reading about his insistence, and I think you should ask the therapist to talk with your mom about how this should be handled on your timeline and not Charles'.  Let her know that you're willing to give him a chance, but he needs to wait to be trusted,  and to give you time and space to process that. He needs to let you know that he respects that you have a dad,  and that he can be an addition to your family,  but he needs to earn that. If he cannot wait,  be patient,  give appropriate time/ space,  then your mom needs to step in and stand up for you.

He\u2019s not relevant to the primary objective.", "I'm going to tell her during therapy.", "Hun, don't listen to moregain\n\nI think your approach and expectations for therapy are logical and NOT to push Charles out of your life. \n\nYou want help expressing your thoughts and feelings in a safe space to your mom. In a constrictive way that won't hurt her. You just want her to understand where you are coming from. This is more about having your mom understand you then it is about Charles. \n\nThen bring Charles into the mix if the therapist/you/your mom see's that as the next move. \n\nNTA", "Charles sounds like a typical abuser, and will get worse after the wedding. Your mom is the real problem here, if she chooses him over you. Charles will never care about your feelings/boundaries.", "I understand your feelings on that, I really do.  But this is also a really counterproductive approach to therapy.  I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll accept that coming from me, but hopefully you will in therapy.  Because what you are asking for is for your mom to choose you or Charles before you even know if you and Charles can find a peaceable relationship.  You don\u2019t want to let Charles in until you have assurances from your mom that if Charles won\u2019t do what you want, she will choose you over him.  And then you don\u2019t have to work Charles at all because if it doesn\u2019t work out at all, you would have reassurance that Charles is gone, no matter what it costs your mom in terms of her own happiness.  You would basically be weaponizing your mom against Charles, at her expense. \n\nThe healthier approach would be to bring Charles into family therapy.  Maybe not in the first few sessions, but on more open terms than you\u2019re willing to consider right now.  For all you know, once you talk through your feelings with Charles in therapy, he will understand your perspective and change his approach without the need for drawing battle lines, forming alliances and demanding fealty.", "If OP\u2019s mom gets married to Charles (or even if they just move in), then 5)3 \u201coriginal family unit\u201d no longer exists because mom\u2019s family will also include her husband and step children.  Where is OP going to go if she chooses not to be a part of that?  She\u2019s still a minor.", "That's not what I'm asking her to do. I'm not saying she has to choose me over Charles. Just that she doesn't have to choose. That nothing has to change between her and me if Charles and his kids are never my dad and siblings or my family. She can still be married to him and be their stepmom. But that she can be okay with me not following what Charles is asking for.", "You sound like Charles, assuming that OP\u2019s existence and this wedding means that she will suddenly never again be able to celebrate or memorialize certain things alone with her mother.  It\u2019s not mutually exclusive", "Yeah, let the therapist take a lead when to bring other family members in to sessions. She is professional and has better position. She probably wants to meet just your mom and stepdad alone without you at some point", "She has already told you that.  She literally agreed to your request that family therapy be just you and her without Charles even though it wasn\u2019t what she wanted.  But she is also a person in her own right, not just a supporting character in your show, and is entitled to her own feelings.", "I never said it was.  But the \u201cfamily unit\u201d necessarily will change.  It already has."]}
