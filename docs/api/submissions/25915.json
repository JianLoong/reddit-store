I (16f) am the only one in the household who isn't talking about the wedding non-stop. My mom picked up on this a while ago and then she overheard me tell my friend I just wanted it to be over and that I wasn't excited for the wedding. So she asked if we could talk. It was a difficult conversation. I told my mom that I wasn't totally happy about the wedding, that it has been difficult for me, with dad, who died when I was 10, being gone and some things that have been said. I told her I was so glad she was happy and I know Charles helped bring her back to herself. The conversation highlighted that I don't see Charles and his kids as my family and that I'm unsure if I'll ever consider them in that way.\n\nSome (maybe) relevant info to some of my feelings: When Charles and his kids moved in first, he took me out for pizza and told me he doesn't want us to be a blended family, he wants us to be just a family. And he doesn't want to be my stepdad. He wants to be my dad. He said he would do everything for me that he does for his kids and would be there for me always. He said we could start trialing out some dad names for me to call him. I told him I already have a dad and the sentiment was nice and all but I was going to be his stepkid. He really challenged me on why I could only have one dad and why I didn't want one. It was very uncomfortable for me. He and his kids also tagged along when mom and I went to remember dad on his anniversary, at the diner we went to as a family. His kids talked non-stop about the wedding and we didn't actually get to talk about dad. Then Charles declared we'd make it a family thing every year and even when mom was like let's just see, he was like it will be good for bonding. I didn't like that at all. It was the first time where I went and did a solo thing to remember dad because I hated every second of the diner experience.\n\nMom wanted us to explore this in family therapy and I asked for it to be just her and me. She was going to say no and then she asked why. I told her I would open up more with just her and a therapist and that I would rather make sure we're okay, than work on trying to bond me to others right now. I told her I could see that she was hurting that I felt the way I do and I didn't want our relationship to be ruined by this. Mom agreed for therapy to be just me and her.\n\nWe start next week. But Charles doesn't like that I wanted it to be just mom and me. I think he was a little offended that I feel this way in the first place and then to not want to include him and his kids in family therapy. Mom told him she wished it could be all of us. But she didn't want to push me away or waste money by taking us all if I would find it difficult to open up around them. Charles told me I was putting my mom in a bad place and I was selfish and he has only ever tried to show me he loves me and will be my dad happily.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693469020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1664txg/aita_for_requesting_therapy_with_just_my_mom/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has kept on pushing and pushing which is ignoring your wishes. If he had any sense about him at all he would realise that pulling back and giving you your space is the best thing he could possibly do to try and form a legitimate relationship with you. By repeatedly trying to force it and by interjecting him and his kids into your things all he is doing is showing that he doesn't respect your boundaries at all. For a guy who wants to be your dad he is really struggling to act like a grown up.", "NTA\n\nCharles need to back off, you have told him how you feel and why you don't see / want him as your Dad.\n\nYou are obviously still grieving for your Dad.\n\nI don't think your Mum is getting how you feel and why you are upset, especially over the anniversary of your Dad, Charles and his kids should never have been involved in that.\n\nMake sure in therapy your Mum understands how you feel and why!", "NTA \n\nCharles is forcing himself on you even after you essentially told him to back off.

But also needs to respect the fact that it's totally ok for you and your mum to have alone time and things just between you two. \n\nIMO. I think you should think about introducing the rest of the family into Therapy at a later point when you and your mum have worked through some issues. \n\nIt does seem like he has your best interests at heart, but I totally agree that you should have this space for yourself for the time being.", "NTA. Charles needs to learn that not everything is about him. You want to do therapy with your mom because you recognise that something is fundamentally wrong between you and you need help processing and fixing it. Charles wants to do everything together because he has the skewed idea that because he's marrying your mom he slots right into your life.\n\nHonestly, your mom might be the biggest AH here. She *knows* Charles is upsetting you and she's letting it happen. Maybe it's what she wants as well, maybe because it's just easier to give in to what he wants. Therapy will help the two of you communicate, and it will tell you whether it's worth trying to save your relationship or whether your mother is picking the new family she's forming as a unit over you.", "NTA.

Charles needs to check him self.  Being some ones Dad is not a choice, its a bond you build over time by building trust. Not by overstepping your boundaries or having you use lables. He is the selfish one here because this is all about him. He wants to be your dad, he wants it to not be a blended family, he wants to be involved in your Dad's anniversery. There seems to be a theme there of him ignoring what other people want.  The fact that he thinks/pretends it was for you doesn't make it any less selfish since it seem he's made much effort to understand why some one might somethign different or respected that. Its not behaviour that build trust. That sounds less like love and more like obsession and a bit of a redflag.", "NTA Charles needs to know his place.

My stepmom was very similar to Charles. She never had children of her own and was constantly saying how my brother and I were her kids and would get furious with us when we\u2019d say, not mom, stepmom. We had a mom and she wasn\u2019t it.

Is Charles this controlling in other ways?", "There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, but first of all, NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re 16. That\u2019s a difficult age as it is. On top of that, you\u2019re getting a new house situation. You were an only child and you\u2019re suddenly getting 3 younger siblings (let\u2019s call them that, because that is the family dynamic you\u2019ll be in). It\u2019s a lot to deal with for you and it\u2019s normal that you need time to adjust. \n\nI\u2019m a child of divorce and have step siblings so I understand a bit of the new family situation. But you\u2019re not a child of divorce, your dad sadly passed. Big difference here and I\u2019m sorry for your loss! Charles was right to try and bond with you, but he\u2019s not right demanding you see him as a dad. He sounds a bit controlling. He should let the relationship evolve naturally, rather than trying to force it. \n\nI understand why you\u2019re not excited about the wedding. Is there any fear here that you might lose your mom to Charles in any way?\n\nThe day you remember your dad should just be about you and your mom. You need to be firm on that and they need to agree. You can have bonding with the new family literally any other day of the year. It doesn\u2019t need to be the day you remember your dad. \n\nYou can explore family therapy later on, but I would definitely start with just you and your mom. I think your mom might not see the issue between you and Charles and it can\u2019t be explored when he and his kids are present. You\u2019re very mature to even want to go to therapy with your mom. Charles has no say in who you go to therapy with, but to make him back off initially, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a start and maybe family therapy can be on the table later on. Whether or not that will be the case, is something that you will see after some therapy with just you and mom.

Then, later on after some sessions you might feel inclined to invite Charles to a session so that you can explain to him in a safe space what you are feeling and maybe he will listen to you.", "A GOOD dad would tell you: \"Call me whatever you like, Chrles is fine. And you will get the same support as the other kids, tell me when you need me. As for joint family rules, we will discuss how to integrate our families with mom, we want all kids to be comfortable, and we need some rules for living together.\"", "Tell your mother that this feels like the start of some control gambit.  This is the exact sort of thing that a guy who sees the women in his life as property would try.  And btw, that might include your mother.\n\nCall me paranoid...but one day he wants you to call you dad?  Maybe a year down the road he's doing virginity checks.  Or driving by away your partner's because he is a \"concerned dad with high standards\".", "At least your mom has finally realized ther eis an issue, and she is willing to listen.", "Good luck, I hope you can sort it out with your Mum", "Tbh I'm one of those people. I grew up with 'step' parents that never really wanted me there at all so I might be biased. \n\nYou're right, he'll never be your dad in that way, but he still wants to help you as a parental figure.", "Make sure you tell your mom about that talk. It sounds like Charles is controlling. Better your mother realize this now BEFORE the wedding.", "Let me rephrase. Like in a sense of, he wants them to all be a family in a way of best interests at heart. \n\nHmmm. Never really considered it that way tbh. I had a lot of step parents that never accepted me into Thier families. Thier family always came first. \n\nSo yeah ok. It is pushy. But he's trying to pull her towards rather than away, but by pulling her in he's pushing her out if that makes sense?? That's just my interpretation.", "Yes that is true. All depends on what OP will want and what type of therapy their psychologist practice. \nHowever the situation with the stepdad will most likely be spoken about anyway, to see how they could deal or not deal with it. That's what I meant to say.", "Totally understandable that you\u2019re starting to dislike him, and I think the issue needs to be solved before the situation is unsalvageable. \n\nTo be clear, you\u2019re not doing anything wrong and nothing needs to be done to \u201cfix\u201d you! The reason I think therapy might be very beneficial, is to make your mom understand how you feel and for a therapist to be present so she doesn\u2019t dismiss your feelings or for a therapist to help you enunciate exactly what it is that\u2019s wrong. Then later on, Charles could be present (if you\u2019re up for that) so he, too, can be made to understand how this situation is pushing you into dislike territory. He\u2019s the one who needs to understand the boundaries you\u2019re (rightfully) setting and to abide by them. \n\nBest of luck!", "It bothers me that he expected to take his place at all if I'm honest. The pushiness is something I particularly dislike.", "He sounds like a real piece of work doesn't he?", "OP having therapy together with charles makes NO sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor therapy to work, he needs to be willing to respect that he is not her dad.\n\nTHEN they can focus on mechanisms to live and interact together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherapy will not fix OP - there IS NOTHING to fix. It will help charles live with a girl who does not want him as her dad, and it will help her find mechanisms that will keep his problem from escalating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This is not an issue with OP, she is perfectly normal and sane (At least with this), this is an issue of charles learning that his expectations are unreasonable.**", "I can understand your POV with what you experienced. I don't know that I will ever regard him as a parental figure. Right now he's someone I don't really like and don't feel comfortable around. I also feel like he doesn't respect my dad's memory or the fact I have a dad and will always love him.", "\"he wants them to all be a family in a way of best interests at heart.\" .. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo. He has HIS OWN best interests at heart. Certainly not OPs. He requires OP to change so she is what HE requires a daughter to be, he does not care who she is or what SHE wants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But he's trying to pull her towards rather than away, \" .. like the snake pulling the rabbit closer into her embrace. And just as nice.", "A lot of step parents? Are you sure you are thinking about OP's situation, or your own?", "That's what I'm hoping for too. It would also be nice to have someone who can help me explain everything and to be there if I get stuck, who could maybe give me ways to get unstuck. Since my mom doesn't know everything and I didn't tell her when we talked originally because I was worried about it going bad, it would be nice to have that support there.\n\nI'm hoping if we do add Charles later, mom might be willing or able to help support me then. Maybe not but it would be nice to have that from her.\n\nI'm wondering how she takes what he said to me though and how forceful he was. But it might take a few weeks to get to that point.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in that situation, I hope therapy helps. It\u2019s your decision what he is to you", "I think a decent therapist could make the space for OP to say what she actually would find supportive from Charles, and make sure Charles actually heard it rather than steam rolling to his own vision. \n\nA third party expert mediator can be really helpful with steam roller people.\n\nA therapist can be helpful in showing the dynamic and offering tools to use instead.", "Take your time explaining your feelings. Your mom may not be aware that Charles is pushing so hard on you and she may not understand why you\u2019re feeling the way you are because of it. From what you\u2019re writing in your post, I get the feeling she\u2019ll be understanding and supportive."]}
