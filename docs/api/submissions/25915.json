I (16f) am the only one in the household who isn't talking about the wedding non-stop. My mom picked up on this a while ago and then she overheard me tell my friend I just wanted it to be over and that I wasn't excited for the wedding. So she asked if we could talk. It was a difficult conversation. I told my mom that I wasn't totally happy about the wedding, that it has been difficult for me, with dad, who died when I was 10, being gone and some things that have been said. I told her I was so glad she was happy and I know Charles helped bring her back to herself. The conversation highlighted that I don't see Charles and his kids as my family and that I'm unsure if I'll ever consider them in that way.\n\nSome (maybe) relevant info to some of my feelings: When Charles and his kids moved in first, he took me out for pizza and told me he doesn't want us to be a blended family, he wants us to be just a family. And he doesn't want to be my stepdad. He wants to be my dad. He said he would do everything for me that he does for his kids and would be there for me always. He said we could start trialing out some dad names for me to call him. I told him I already have a dad and the sentiment was nice and all but I was going to be his stepkid. He really challenged me on why I could only have one dad and why I didn't want one. It was very uncomfortable for me. He and his kids also tagged along when mom and I went to remember dad on his anniversary, at the diner we went to as a family. His kids talked non-stop about the wedding and we didn't actually get to talk about dad. Then Charles declared we'd make it a family thing every year and even when mom was like let's just see, he was like it will be good for bonding. I didn't like that at all. It was the first time where I went and did a solo thing to remember dad because I hated every second of the diner experience.\n\nMom wanted us to explore this in family therapy and I asked for it to be just her and me. She was going to say no and then she asked why. I told her I would open up more with just her and a therapist and that I would rather make sure we're okay, than work on trying to bond me to others right now. I told her I could see that she was hurting that I felt the way I do and I didn't want our relationship to be ruined by this. Mom agreed for therapy to be just me and her.\n\nWe start next week. But Charles doesn't like that I wanted it to be just mom and me. I think he was a little offended that I feel this way in the first place and then to not want to include him and his kids in family therapy. Mom told him she wished it could be all of us. But she didn't want to push me away or waste money by taking us all if I would find it difficult to open up around them. Charles told me I was putting my mom in a bad place and I was selfish and he has only ever tried to show me he loves me and will be my dad happily.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693469020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1664txg/aita_for_requesting_therapy_with_just_my_mom/", "score": 1041, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has kept on pushing and pushing which is ignoring your wishes. If he had any sense about him at all he would realise that pulling back and giving you your space is the best thing he could possibly do to try and form a legitimate relationship with you. By repeatedly trying to force it and by interjecting him and his kids into your things all he is doing is showing that he doesn't respect your boundaries at all. For a guy who wants to be your dad he is really struggling to act like a grown up.", "NTA\n\nCharles need to back off, you have told him how you feel and why you don't see / want him as your Dad.\n\nYou are obviously still grieving for your Dad.\n\nI don't think your Mum is getting how you feel and why you are upset, especially over the anniversary of your Dad, Charles and his kids should never have been involved in that.\n\nMake sure in therapy your Mum understands how you feel and why!", "NTA \n\nCharles is forcing himself on you even after you essentially told him to back off.

You've clearly explained that you'll open up more if it's just you and your mum. \n\nI think it's fair to at least start with you and your mum and maybe have it as an end goal to have the whole family but it sounds like you have to work on your own issues first to do with your dad ect. \n\nIt does sound like Charles is hurt and just wants you to accept him and his family. But also needs to respect the fact that it's totally ok for you and your mum to have alone time and things just between you two. \n\nIMO. I think you should think about introducing the rest of the family into Therapy at a later point when you and your mum have worked through some issues. \n\nIt does seem like he has your best interests at heart, but I totally agree that you should have this space for yourself for the time being.", "NTA. Charles needs to learn that not everything is about him. You want to do therapy with your mom because you recognise that something is fundamentally wrong between you and you need help processing and fixing it. Charles wants to do everything together because he has the skewed idea that because he's marrying your mom he slots right into your life.\n\nHonestly, your mom might be the biggest AH here. She *knows* Charles is upsetting you and she's letting it happen. Maybe it's what she wants as well, maybe because it's just easier to give in to what he wants. Therapy will help the two of you communicate, and it will tell you whether it's worth trying to save your relationship or whether your mother is picking the new family she's forming as a unit over you.", "NTA.

Charles needs to check him self.  Being some ones Dad is not a choice, its a bond you build over time by building trust. Not by overstepping your boundaries or having you use lables. He is the selfish one here because this is all about him. He wants to be your dad, he wants it to not be a blended family, he wants to be involved in your Dad's anniversery. There seems to be a theme there of him ignoring what other people want.  The fact that he thinks/pretends it was for you doesn't make it any less selfish since it seem he's made much effort to understand why some one might want  something different or respected that. Its not behaviour that builds trust. That sounds less like love and more like obsession and a bit of a redflag.", "NTA Charles needs to know his place.

My stepmom was very similar to Charles. She never had children of her own and was constantly saying how my brother and I were her kids and would get furious with us when we\u2019d say, not mom, stepmom. We had a mom and she wasn\u2019t it.

Is Charles this controlling in other ways?", "There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, but first of all, NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re 16. That\u2019s a difficult age as it is. On top of that, you\u2019re getting a new house situation. You were an only child and you\u2019re suddenly getting 3 younger siblings (let\u2019s call them that, because that is the family dynamic you\u2019ll be in). It\u2019s a lot to deal with for you and it\u2019s normal that you need time to adjust. \n\nI\u2019m a child of divorce and have step siblings so I understand a bit of the new family situation. But you\u2019re not a child of divorce, your dad sadly passed. Big difference here and I\u2019m sorry for your loss! Charles was right to try and bond with you, but he\u2019s not right demanding you see him as a dad. He sounds a bit controlling. He should let the relationship evolve naturally, rather than trying to force it. \n\nI understand why you\u2019re not excited about the wedding. Is there any fear here that you might lose your mom to Charles in any way?\n\nThe day you remember your dad should just be about you and your mom. You need to be firm on that and they need to agree. You can have bonding with the new family literally any other day of the year. It doesn\u2019t need to be the day you remember your dad. \n\nYou can explore family therapy later on, but I would definitely start with just you and your mom. I think your mom might not see the issue between you and Charles and it can\u2019t be explored when he and his kids are present. You\u2019re very mature to even want to go to therapy with your mom. Charles has no say in who you go to therapy with, but to make him back off initially, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a start and maybe family therapy can be on the table later on. Whether or not that will be the case, is something that you will see after some therapy with just you and mom.

Like he thinks that if he's pushy enough, you'll fall in line. It's hard to verbalize what I'm feeling,  but a feeling of malaise popped up with reading about his insistence, and I think you should ask the therapist to talk with your mom about how this should be handled on your timeline and not Charles'.  Let her know that you're willing to give him a chance, but he needs to wait to be trusted,  and to give you time and space to process that. He needs to let you know that he respects that you have a dad,  and that he can be an addition to your family,  but he needs to earn that. If he cannot wait,  be patient,  give appropriate time/ space,  then your mom needs to step in and stand up for you.

You can use that resource to help work out ways to get across to Charles that the more he pushes the harder it gets for you to trust him, and that you need him to slow right down and let you regain trust so you can start building a relationship.\n\nYou say he wants to treat you like one of his kids - it\u2019s important to note that that\u2019s the problem. Make clear to him that maybe with 9, 11 and 13 years of supportive parenting from him you will feel about him just like they do, and you likely would if he was 100% of your experience of having a dad. Right now he\u2019s not even 5% of your experience of having a dad; and on top of that you\u2019re not a brand new baby, you\u2019re two years from being an adult. Building a relationship with you is different from building a relationship with them.\n\nTo get a good outcome, I strongly recommend you take the line with Charles that you *want* a good relationship with him and for him to be able to be a dad to you, but that you need time; and just like if something happened to him his kids would struggle for a long time with the idea of replacing him, you\u2019re still going to struggle and you need him to give you space to grieve. In cases like this pushy step-parents often want reassurance that you want to build a relationship, and it costs you nothing to say you want that as a negotiation step to get them to approach it how you ask them to; and in cases like this it often takes them thinking about their own children being asked to move on from *them* to get the point across.\n\nGood luck.

Sorry if that makes no sense but I don't know how to describe that. It's sort of \"if you can't beat em, join em\", or \"if you won't join my family with my kids then me and my kids will \"join\" your family\".

But if her mom won\u2019t give OP the kind of reassurance she is looking for, or if she says the words but OP doesn\u2019t trust them, then the next step for OP in therapy is to figure out for herself what to do with that.

I mean, I think she's coming from a basically good place in which she sees you in distress and grief (sure, probably not all the time, but I'm also sure the grief probably isn't very far away a lot of the time), and she is trying to make it better. \n\nYour mom is used to being the one who heals what hurts you and makes things better. It has to be incredibly difficult as a parent to see your child grieve and not be able to do much about it.

Maybe you can ask her why it's so very important to her to replace your father? (If she says she's not trying to replace him, fine, then why does she need you to have another father? Lots of children grow up without a father; why does she think this is so necessary *for you*?)  \n\nGrief moves at different paces for different people. She's ready to move on, but she needs to recognize that *forcing* you to move on isn't going to make you move on - it's going to alienate you, it's going to make you defend your father's memory all the more, and it's going to make you resent Charles. \n\nIt may also be that a lot of this is coming from Charles. Getting her alone is valuable for that reason - it's very telling that he is mad you want to do fucking THERAPY with just her. That's bonkers. \n\n**Insist on doing therapy with just your mother.

Once she\u2019s officially Charles wife I\u2019m sure in their heads wife = mom.", "That's got to be the worst take I've seen on reddit today. \n\nOP NTA l, you need to get on the same page with your mom and therapy just the two of you is the way to start \n\nOptomisticly  Charles is projecting the closeness he hopes your mother and his kids will have.", "Sometimes when you\u2019re a kid, the goal of family therapy is \u201cI need a safe space where I can tell my mom something that I\u2019m worried may upset her.\u201d\n\nOP is a kid. She doesn\u2019t know how to handle all that\u2019s happening in her family right now, and she wants a skilled professional to help guide this conversation with her mom in a constructive way. That\u2019s a valid therapy goal.", "Why are you so invested in being a jerk to a grieving child who doesn\u2019t know where she stands in her relationship with her mom?", "A blended family doesn\u2019t have to mean one big happy family. It can mean that for some people. But it can also include smaller family units under the big family umbrella. OP\u2019s not going to move out and disown her family over this, she just wants her own family unit to still exist as part of the larger family unit. And that\u2019s possible if her mom is willing to help her with it and maintain her boundaries.", "Your step dad sounds controlling and suffocating. Hopefully your mom will realize this in therapy and put her foot down with him.", "Is his real name Ted? Because I am getting strong Ted from that Buffy episode vibes from this guy. \n\nIn your shoes, I would do the therapy with Mom (you sound very emotionally mature), work hard for good grades and test scores, then go to college far away. Maybe grad school, too. Mom can visit on parents weekend & her husband can stay home with his kids. But I had a crappy step dad & watched every single episode of Buffy many times, so I might be biased. NTA and good luck", "NTA. You have a much more mature perspective and understanding of your feelings than Charles does of his. You and your mom should go to your therapy, and it'd possible, only if you're comfortable with it, that there might be space in the future for Charles to participate in a session or two to see if that could help him hear what you've been saying. But if you never want to do that, you have every right to set that boundary.", "NTA. The step dad/dad thing might happen someday, but he has to earn that to some degree. But, he does make your mom happy, right?\n\nI've dated the same woman for just over 20 years. When we met her girls were 5 and 3. It took a bit to get comfortable with each other, as they missed their dad (good guy, but even he admits he shouldn't have been a dad or husband).", "Nta", "I don't know if this was already posted or if it will get to you OP. But if you can't convince mom on going to family therapy only the 2 of you, insist on getting therapy just for yourself. I think you can benefit from a safe place to speak. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, at all.    The therapy at which you are likely to discuss your feelings and reservations you have about the new people joining your family is not likely to be anywhere near as beneficial if those people are sat in the room with you - it\u2019s obvious you wouldn\u2019t be able to open up properly and really engage if they are there.   \n\nGood luck with it.    I really wish you and your mom the best.    It would be nice if you get to a point where you feel comfortable having therapy with Charles there too (it might also help him realise his place), but it is really important that YOU feel ready for it and are open to it, not just because he wants you to see him a certain way.", "NTA. I actually hate Charles. \n\nYou get to feel what you feel and want what you want. They can\u2019t force you to be a \u201cfamily\u201d and he will never replace or compare to your father.\n\nYour mom needs to set and enforce boundaries with him on your behalf as well- when you are having a day of remembering your dad, or an anniversary, you should be able to do that with just your mom if that\u2019s what you want. They need to respect that they\u2019re not a part of that, and there\u2019s no reason they should be intruding on that.", "Honestly, I\u2019d kind of like to see Charles go to the group therapy, just so the therapist can see how much he\u2019s steamrolling OP and intervene!", "I don't honestly think what he said came from a place of malice. However I do think it came from a place of ignorance. I can understand what he was trying to get but he went about it the wrong way. I also can understand you not wanting to burden your mother with this but you do need to open up to her and let her in on why exactly you are feeling the way you are feeling and about your conversations with Charles. Because that is not your battle to fight. That is a discussion that your mom needs to have with him. And she can't support you and how you feel if you don't tell her.", "He\u2019s a vulture.", "I mean, yeah that would obviously be better. Why does he get to parent OP? They\u2019ve lived together for all of six months. She\u2019s going to be an adult in less than two years, and he comes barging in to her life insisting \u201cI\u2019m going to be your dad now\u201d and then has the balls to make the anniversary of her dad\u2019s death all about what he and his kids want.", "I agree he\u2019s got it all worked out in his head the perfect family fantasy without taking anyone else\u2019s feelings into consideration. \n\nNext it\u2019ll be \u201cyou need to watch your brothers and sisters\u201d\nGiving OP\u2019s possessions to step siblings and forcing them together. \nTrying to parent OP because he\u2019s her \u201cnew dad\u201d \n\nIt sounds like he\u2019s trying to erase and replace OP\u2019s dad and force everyone together on his terms. \n\nIf he really cared he\u2019d be wanting to take time to build a proper relationship and support OP and her mum getting therapy so she can get the help to come to terms with her new family life and then include him in her own time. \n\nIt certainly comes across as manipulation and I agree he\u2019s probably feeding OP\u2019s mum with the idea of stability she longs for. If his kids are also excited about the wedding then he\u2019s been putting in effort to encourage them to buy into a perfect family vision, as they are younger then I expect he\u2019s been telling them about a \u201ccool big sister\u201d who will spend time with them and love them instantly and want to include them. \n\nIt\u2019s isolating for an only child to be forced into this situation. \nOP is the outsider as mum has a new husband and step siblings have all grown up together. \n\nI hope OP and her mum get a therapist who can help with OP\u2019s mum and new husband\u2019s expectations and see that a family can\u2019t just be forced by getting married. \n\nAt least OP only has a couple of years before she\u2019s an adult and can leave home. \nI think it\u2019s going to be a tough couple of years though unless her mother sees how unrealistic it is that they will all be living in harmony without putting work in and giving it time.", "This should be top comment. It's spot on about Charles wanting to control the narrative.", "She will need mentors and advisers her entire life, this dude is trying to be there for her. My bet is 10 to 15 years  she\u2019s going to have a change of heart when she realizes how hard he\u2019s tried.", "She has the exact same amount of mentors and advisors in her life as she did before her mom got together with him. He\u2019s not trying to be there for her, he\u2019s obviously doing all of this for himself out of some sort of misguided idea that blended families are inherently inferior to \u201creal\u201d families.", "It might also help to take some time before therapy and write things down that you'd like her to know \u2764\ufe0f Sometimes once the conversation starts it's hard to keep track in your head of what information you wanted to get across, so if you have a few little notes to refer to that could help! And if you don't end up needing them then no harm no foul \u2764\ufe0f", "Wow Charles really flipped a switch. He's so dead set on making this work that he's all but guaranteed this will fail. Relationships take time & patience to build. He is pushing too hard\nEDIT: finished my comment. I hit the wrong button again.", "NTA. Charles is pushing too hard. I think he will eventually need to hear that and the reasons in which he\u2019s pushing too hard so eventually you and he and maybe the rest of the fam should try some sessions, but it is absolutely not an AH move to just have sessions with your mom now. You have a lot to work through and it is responsible of you to do that at the right pace for you and not let them overrun you on this.", "NTA - if Charles had tried being your friend rather than insisting on you calling him \"Dad\" you probably wouldn't have as many problems as you're having.\n\nYour mom chose Charles, that doesn't mean you have to.", "NTA and definitely tell your mom about Charles last comment (in counseling) if you haven\u2019t already. And maybe start recording your conversations if he continues comments like that, he\u2019ll likely try to spin it around and say you\u2019re overreacting.", "He doesn't get to say he's your father now. That's not how it works.", "THIS!!!!  Charles is very, very pushy--at best--and might decide after the wedding that having anything to do with OP's father around to be hurting their \"family bonding.\" That erasing OP's father is the best way to get OP to accept him as her dad. Charles is a deeply selfish man.", "Yeah, but mom is also concerned about OP& a bit displeased with his behavior too. Hopefully some therapy can help them communicate to each other, set boundaries & developing a healthy way to start a relationship between the families. It will take time though. Charles if anything, malicious or not, is clearly impatient \ud83d\ude44."]}
