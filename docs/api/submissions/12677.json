My girlfriend (27F) (let's call her Sarah) and I (26M) have been together for three years. She's always been passionate about her job as a teacher and has worked really hard to build up her career.\n\nHowever, a few weeks ago, I accidentally stumbled upon some photos of Sarah on Instagram that I had never seen before. They were pictures of her in some very revealing clothing, and some of them were even nude. I was shocked and confronted her about it, and she told me that she used to be a lingerie model before becoming a teacher. She said she stopped doing it because she didn't want it to affect her career, and she thought I knew about it already.\n\nI didn't know how to react at first, but eventually, I told a few of my friends about it. One of my friends is a gossip and ended up telling someone who works at the school where Sarah teaches. Long story short, the photos somehow got into the hands of the school board, and Sarah was fired for \"unprofessional behavior\".\n\nSarah is devastated and blames me for ruining her career. She says that I should have kept my mouth shut and that I betrayed her trust. I feel terrible about what happened, but I didn't know that it would lead to this.

My girlfriend (27F) (let's call her Sarah) and I (26M) have been together for three years. She's always been passionate about her job as a teacher and has worked really hard to build up her career.\n\nHowever, a few weeks ago, I accidentally stumbled upon some photos of Sarah on Instagram that I had never seen before. They were pictures of her in some very revealing clothing, and some of them were even nude. I was shocked and confronted her about it, and she told me that she used to be a lingerie model before becoming a teacher. She said she stopped doing it because she didn't want it to affect her career, and she thought I knew about it already.\n\nI didn't know how to react at first, but eventually, I told a few of my friends about it. One of my friends is a gossip and ended up telling someone who works at the school where Sarah teaches. Long story short, the photos somehow got into the hands of the school board, and Sarah was fired for \"unprofessional behavior\".\n\nSarah is devastated and blames me for ruining her career. She says that I should have kept my mouth shut and that I betrayed her trust. I feel terrible about what happened, but I didn't know that it would lead to this. AITA for accidentally ruining my girlfriend's career?", "NTA - look you shouldn\u2019t have talked about it but also, did she specify to you that she wanted this to be kept private?

However, I get wanting to get an opinion on it. \n\nI find it suspicious that she \u201cthought you knew.\u201d It is obviously something she was trying to keep hidden from people. It\u2019s something she should have addressed with you upfront if it was a big enough deal that she needs to keep it hidden from her work. \n\nAlso, she still has them on instagram. That\u2019s on her for never deleting them. \n\nI would definitely apologize because obviously her getting fired was not your intention. You need to reevaluate your relationships with the people you discussed this way. Someone clearly violated your trust.", "YTA", "YTA . You blabbed on purpose because you were angry at her.

She didn't lose her teaching job, but her daughters were asked to leave the Catholic school they were enrolled at.\n\nShe was unable to get the photos removed because they were not her property.", "this is exactly what I originally assumed based on the fact they would be so damaging to her. yes OP is totes the AH because he must have sent a link too", "Then in that case it\u2019s about time for women to realize that doing this kind of work will have long term consequences \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and that\u2019s coming from another woman. You can choose to do that kind of work, but it can and should close future doors for you.", "Ooh, can she do that?\nSue him for what exactly...", "They \"somehow\" ended up in the school board's hands. Like it's just some mysterious coincidence.", "That was my question, did he do this on purpose and now feels badly because the outcome seemed obvious that this would end the relationship. Even if the school didn't find out I'm pretty sure she didn't want his gossipy friends getting a hold of them either. Maybe she didn't tell him about them for a reason.", "I'm sure that neurotic parents have searched (& will continue to search) for their child's teacher on social medial to get one up. I have my personally identifying social media accounts set to private because I'm aware of the lengths unhinged people can go inorder to search for anything illicit to use for their own personal gain.", "Good point.", "I know, it is pure ignorance that people get in trouble for this stuff and lose their jobs. I recently heard about a female police officer that it happened to. Lingerie modeling is not porn. But, it also only seems to be women that are disproportionately affected by this. I rarely (if ever) have heard about a man losing his job because 10 years ago he modeled calvin klein underwear on a giant billboard.", "Someone else made a very good point, if she was a lingerie model and he found them online by surprise, there's a very good chance she doesn't own the rights to those pictures and couldn't take them down. And this isn't the same as an only fans, this was prior to her teaching career so why should that come back to bite her.", "You're also assuming she didn't. I have friends who did similar things and RARELY will they take old content down they paid for it.", "The pictures obviously weren't on her instagram, but on a modeling page's instagram.", "you\u2019re embarrassing", "modeling is a job. you're acting like she was a prostitute or something... (which is also a job)\n\nIf she was doing it for a job, she did not have control over those pictures, the agency/company did. \n\nTherefore in your original comment \"why didn't she delete them?\" THAT'S why. Even if she regrets what she did (which she really doesn't have to because it's JUST. A. JOB. ) There would be nothing she could do anyway. \n\nI hope you're ashamed of yourself and your lack of logical reasoning.", "Wow what the actual Fuck. It\u2019s already creepy to be reposting such an old pic of someone who no longer works for you\u2026 But to then name them publicly\u2026. Wtaf", "Wtf that's so fucking stupid. The bar should have asked her if it would be okay to repost those pics, and why punish the daughters??????? Ughhhhhhhhdhhsjsjskdjsksj", "That\u2019s really inconsiderate of the bar to include the full name of someone who hasn\u2019t worked their in years (maybe even decades). I get posting the pictures since they belong to them technically, but adding a full name? They have literally no idea where she is in life or how that could effect her. I\u2019m mad for her, that feels so disrespectful", "It should not close any doors for a woman to have done professional modelling, even if some of the modelling was nude photos.  We should stop trying to force puritanical standards on teachers and instead evaluate them on how well they teach.", "I know a doctor who stripped her way through medical school. Best damn doctor I have ever known, she really cares and takes time that many don't. She also had NO debt from her many years of schooling. Sounds smart to me. And anyone who wouldn't want to see her because she was a stripper 20 years ago is ignorant and pretty damn stupid.", "Why should it stop you from doing other jobs in the future?", "stfu.", "It I was her I\u2019d at least consult a lawyer. He was the only one who knew about the photos and then suddenly her boss had copies? Maybe defamation\u2026 He\u2019s definitely left a clear trail that he initiated this and made the content public. \n\nThere maybe nothing she can do, but I\u2019d let a lawyer look it over.", "And how many men do that kind of thing vs how many women?\n\nThink.", "It shouldn't...but it can and has!  \n\nYes, IF. But she has them on her own personal page and she hasn't taken them down from there either. That's not being smart.", "OP also said there were nudes. That doesn't sound like lingerie modeling to me. She didn't have to keep those pics on her IG. I agree she should have removed them.", "Not at all.\n\nWhat is embarrassing is taking naked pictures of yourself for money and thinking it will never catch up with you.\n\nGet a sense of reality.", "So the naked pictures were for modeling?\n\nModeling what exactly?\n\nGet real.\n\nCould be onlyfan \"models\".", "weird argument considering modeling agencies use all genders.", "He never said they were on her personal profile. If they were, then yes, I could understand it being somewhat her fault.", "1) the narrator has already proven he is unreliable by saying he \u201caccidentally\u201d ruined her career whereas he was clearly snooping around, and he clearly intentionally blabbed to his friends \n2) then he calls his friends gossips while he himself is a gossip\n3) there are some lingerie models today who are extremely popular and no one considers them to be embarrassing \n4) her past job did not \u201ccatch up with her\u201d. it was left in the past. her snoop of a boyfriend couldn\u2019t keep a private conversation they had between them and had to go and tell other guys who couldn\u2019t keep their mouth shut either \n5) yes, you are embarrassing for being ignorant and blaming the victim. i may be wrong but you\u2019re probably a guy yourself? of course, i\u2019m not generalising all guys, there are a lot of wonderful ones, but i doubt a woman could be this oblivious and plain old stupid", "It is way more embarrassing to think that doing modeling work is something that should be stigmatized", "Not naked. Lingerie. \n\nYou realize people make career changes, right?  Maybe she became a teacher later in life. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with modeling, and there's nothing wrong with being a model and a teacher, either. How would that impact her ability to teach?", "Uh-huh. And what's the ratio? Which is -by far- the most numerous?\n\n\"This doesn't feel good to me, therefore common sense doesn't apply and you're bad\"", "Well shit, now we need more info. Lol", "Like naked modeling?\n\nLike Only fan \"models\"?\n\nIn my book, actual models have at least some clothes on.", "The point is that Men who engage in online behaviors - like posting shirtless photos or even lingerie are less likely to face repercussions for it.\n\nYour argument is nonsensical.", "either or.  \nyour book is outdated", "Explain why posting naked pictures of yourself online is \"modeling\"\n\nAnd explain why it shouldn't have repercussions later on in your life?\n\nMy book might be old, but it's a history book, not a fantasy one."]}
