{"id": 31364, "submission_id": "17zsa9c", "title": "AITA for bringing hand vacuum to the office and then reporting colleague to HR?", "selftext": "Throwaway due to privacy. \n I (F31) recently found out that I am allergic to dust mites. 30 years I've been told that I was being hormonal, overthinking, on PMS and other things, when raising my concerns of my health, mostly because I am a woman I would have severe rash - and the only answer - it's your hormones, once you will have your first period/pregnancy it' go over - not; then cold like symptoms-again it's due to hormones, it'll be over when you'll get pregnant - again not). I guess this will be relevant later. Now, I am back at my work after my maternity leave and I work at IT company, with open office for 200 employees, so when you come inside it's all computers as far as the eye can see - which is a lot of dust due to poor building ventilation system.\nSo, in order to reduce dust at least on my desk I have a very small and silent vacuum, and just clean my desk every morning (again, might be relevant later - I clock in around 7\nAM, the only people on the floor are kitchen worker and security). Recently, a colleague of mine, let's say Tom (M,35-ish) started to give me snarky comments on how lam overreacting and I have OCD and should go to therapy and maybe take some leave. I politely thanked for concerning about my mental health but I am not overreacting but rather following my allergy protocol. I gave no more details as I don't think it's any concern of his, we aren't close and I purely see him as my colleague so business only. I also asked to stop that behavior as it makes me feel uncomfortable as if I should be ashamed of being allergic (which I am not, tons of people have same issues). Unfortunately, comments didn't stop, I asked several times to stop, and one day I felt like I had enough and emailed HR explaining the situation. Well shit hit the fan and dude got a note saying on more complaint, even in word) and he's out. Well now he's pissed and told me that I was overreacting and pulled a typical female and I could've just stop with my bullshit and he would've stopped. I talked with my husband and he sides with me, saying that Tom is now gaslighting me, my friends and other colleagues are divided. Which got me thinking that maybe I took this way too much, and I should've taken anti-allergy pills in the morning to help me throughout the day. Part of me thinks that Tom is a misogynist douchebag who just hates women and if not me other coworker would end up as his target. And his attitude towards women just pissed me off as I faced same bs through all my life and he was just the unlucky one who crossed the line.
