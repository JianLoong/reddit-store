I guess this will be relevant later. Now, I am back at my work after my maternity leave and I work at IT company, with open office for 200 employees, so when you come inside it's all computers as far as the eye can see - which is a lot of dust due to poor building ventilation system.\nSo, in order to reduce dust at least on my desk I have a very small and silent vacuum, and just clean my desk every morning (again, might be relevant later - I clock in around 7\nAM, the only people on the floor are kitchen worker and security). Recently, a colleague of mine, let's say Tom (M,35-ish) started to give me snarky comments on how lam overreacting and I have OCD and should go to therapy and maybe take some leave. I politely thanked for concerning about my mental health but I am not overreacting but rather following my allergy protocol. I gave no more details as I don't think it's any concern of his, we aren't close and I purely see him as my colleague so business only. I also asked to stop that behavior as it makes me feel uncomfortable as if I should be ashamed of being allergic (which I am not, tons of people have same issues). Unfortunately, comments didn't stop, I asked several times to stop, and one day I felt like I had enough and emailed HR explaining the situation. Well shit hit the fan and dude got a note saying on more complaint, even in word) and he's out. Well now he's pissed and told me that I was overreacting and pulled a typical female and I could've just stop with my bullshit and he would've stopped. I talked with my husband and he sides with me, saying that Tom is now gaslighting me, my friends and other colleagues are divided. Which got me thinking that maybe I took this way too much, and I should've taken anti-allergy pills in the morning to help me throughout the day. Part of me thinks that Tom is a misogynist douchebag who just hates women and if not me other coworker would end up as his target. And his attitude towards women just pissed me off as I faced same bs through all my life and he was just the unlucky one who crossed the line.

You've been subject to an astonishing amount of sexism (which is unfortunately common both in medicine and at work), and I sincerely doubt you're the only one who's complained about this asshole. He's on thin ice not because of *you*, but because of *himself* and *his own behavior.*\n\nAs a long-time allergy sufferer myself, I do have some advice for you as someone who's newly diagnosed. But I must make it clear that your solution is perfectly fine, and this is only advice to make *your* life better, not for the sake of your sexist coworker.  \n\nI don't recommend taking allergy medicine in the morning. The most common side effect of antihistamines is sleepiness, so if you take it in the morning, you'll likely be sleepy all day, even if they're marketed as \"non-drowsy.\" I take an antihistamine every night to protect me through the next day-- if you find one that works for you, it should help for 24 hours. I take a generic form of Zyrtec. If you're in the US, you can get it at Costco. Some people also find that switching allergy medicines every year or every couple of years helps keep their effectiveness up, but I've stuck with one for years and that works for me. \n\nIf your allergies impact your life a lot, it might be worth looking into allergy shots. They can be expensive depending on where you live/insurance and such, because you need to have the shots given to you frequently, but they can be *extremely* helpful for people with severe environmental allergies. I've done a couple of courses of them, but was never able to complete a course fully due to insurance issues, and even then they've helped massively and I can now spend time around cats and don't notice my symptoms in pet-free places as long as I take my antihistamine (before, even with the antihistamine, I was suffering all the time).\n\nEdit to add: Also, remember that workplaces are legally required to provide reasonable accommodations for disabilities, and not all disabilities are big and dramatic-- some are small things, like suffering from allergies. Frequently, disability accommodations can benefit *everyone.* So, a reasonable accommodation here might be something like having cleaners take care of dust more frequently, adding better filters to the building's ventilation system, or placing some portable air filters to supplement the building's central ventilation. This would benefit everybody because even people without allergies can breathe better in less dusty environments, and computers last longer when they're not being clogged with dust. Businesses often drag their feet on accommodations that only benefit a few people or don't impact work directly, but mitigating the dust issue would directly benefit everyone's work and make things faster and more effective, which makes it at least a more attractive option.\n\nYou might decide not to ask for accommodation because you're already providing your own solution, but you might decide it's worth bringing up just to create a better workplace for everyone.", "NTA - You asked him to stop and he didn\u2019t.
