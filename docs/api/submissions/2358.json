I fully support Susan following her dreams but always felt it wouldn\u2019t be a forever thing, eventually they would pick a place to live and take vacations less frequently.\n\nDue to the fact that they are rarely in the country, we don\u2019t get to see each other in person often. One of the few chances was earlier this year (I think February) I asked if she planned to settle down anytime soon. She said that was between her and her husband and seemed annoyed. I told that if she does then she should tell me and I would help her with her house deposit  then dropped the subject. \n\nWith thanksgiving coming soon, Susan came to say with us a while. At a family dinner she said that she would start settling down. I was excited for her and asked if she had a place in mind, she did, a house in the neighboring city. It was closer than I thought she would want. I asked why and she said so that we could could visit more often. She asked if I was still going to help with the deposit, I told her yes. She asked if I could also help with baby supplies as they don\u2019t have much savings.\n\nI was confused at what baby until she made another announcement that she was pregnant. I congratulated her when she gave me a list of all the things she would need for her pregnancy and the baby\u2019s first year. \n\nI told her that I would try and get some things from the list by the baby shower. She replied that she would need all of those things and if I was going to pressure her into a pregnancy, I should at least \u2018take responsibility.\u2019 I was confused until through further argument I realized that she took my questions about settling down as asking for grandkids. \n\nWhen I told her there might be a misunderstanding, she  interrupted and said she would also need me to babysit.

I apologized but told her I couldn\u2019t do it. She and her husband left and stayed at a hotel.\n\nI then wake up to many missed calls and text from relatives and find out she had posted on social media that I had forced to have a child earlier than she wanted and refused to help with it.

Her and her husband need to grow up and act like responsible adults and not spoiled, entitled brats. \n\nDo not even bother with helping them with a down payment!  \n\nTheir demand for you to practically buy and raise their child is baffling beyond belief!", "NTA. You raised your child. It's time for her to raise her own.", "NTA - I imagine you already regret helping with the deposit.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter never learned financial responsibility, especially when she comments she has no savings. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t have the financials, she\u2019s going to have to learn to find used items for a low price. My parents just found consignment sales where slightly used onesies for $1 to $3 each. In 9 months, it\u2019s definitely doable to set up a nursery for just a couple hundred dollars.\n\nI would say Y T A if you do just fall for it all and financially support her rather than use this time to teach her financial responsibility. \n\nI\u2019m currently pregnant and my parents are gifting me a pack and play (they found 50% off at target) and $40 of slightly used baby clothes. I suggest you limit your support to similar or less.", "NTA. Your daughter needs help, but not the kind she asked you for.", "NTA for the question, BUT\n\nI think as a mum you have done some very enabling things to your old child.  You never had the taking responsibility for your own actions talk?  \n\nAnd for her to spring that to you your reactions are \"it's a misunderstanding?\"  So now you are telling them to have sex and forced them to get pregnant?  It seemed like they obviously didn't need to ask for your permission?  \n\nHow about they have been too reckless about their own behaviours, forget a condom or pills, and then when \"accidents\" happen, its now mum's fault because you asked them about settling down? \n\nI am sure that your many relatives who are so sympathetic to them can let them stay, including paying for the baby and raising them.  See how fast they run.", "I feel sorry for the baby. \n\nYour daughter sounds ridiculous. She was in charge of her reproduction, not you. You didn't \"force\" anything on her. She made her own decision. Don't listen to any nonsense about how you were responsible. \n\nYour daughter also sounds very manipulative. She wants to force you to babysit. Wait until she threatens to not let you see the baby if you don't babysit. That will be her next move. You stand your ground and refuse to babysit. She'll have to find a way to cope. \n\nI'm really sorry this happening to you. Now should be a nice time of planning for the baby not a time of conflict over who pays for what. Buy her a nice crib or stroller and stop at that. She doesn't get to tell you how to spend your money and you certainly don't owe her anything.", "NTA, I know the term settle down has more then one meaning but your not responsible for this.", "NTA\n\nWow, your daughter sounds, sorry to say this, like a god-awful person.", "NTA.\n\n1. Daughter is not a responsible adult if she decides to have a baby based on one question from you.\n2. She is not a responsible adult if she decides to have a baby assuming you will do an unending list of things... without her having a single conversation about that with you. (Offering to help her with a down payment is not offering all the things she assumed you would provide for her.)\n3. She is not a decent human being if she decides to create a life that she has no intention of giving her time and care to and doesn't even say she and her husband want.\n4. She is not a decent human being if she wants to try to bully and embarrass you into giving into her demands.\n5. The truth is she probably got pregnant by accident and decided to suddenly have always believed you were pressuring her for a child; so she is probably a big liar as well.\n\nThe first thing is to say no to everything she is expecting from you. Limit your help with the down payment to what you feel comfortable with (and what is in your heart, given how she is treating you). Do not let her bully/guilt you into one thing more.\n\nI'm not big into social media, so I would probably just ignore anything she posted. However, if you are more connected and think this is appropriate for you, you can respond to her post with this:\n\n1. My asking once at the start of this year if daughter is going to settle down anytime soon (not one thing more) is a horrible reason for any mature adult to decide to have a child.\n2. Me offering to help with a down payment on a home whenever they decide to settle down does not translate into my offering to fully fund and care for the child because the child's parents cannot be bothered to care for their child and didn't bother to determine if they were financially or emotionally ready to have a child.\n3. Anyone who feels that adults such as daughter and SIL should be able to create a baby with the expectation that another person is *de facto* responsible for care for and paying for that child is welcome to take on that responsibility. They didn't discuss their expectations with me or seek my buy-in, so the fact that they didn't do that with you either shouldn't stop you from giving them the bailout you feel they should have.", "NTA, \nIt sounds like she is entitled AF. \nIf she works remotely then there is no reason she can not take care of the baby. \n\nI grew up traveling all over as a child. Though it was very different circumstances it gives the child an experience that you can not replicate. Will it be different for them yes. But it is totally doable. \nSounds like they just want to keep traveling without their current live being inconvenienced by a child. \nThey sound incredibly selfish. \nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to help facilitate their fantasy life.", "NTA.  Your daughter needs counseling. There is no way she could really thought you meant you wanted her to get pregnant and for you to take responsibility for the child. This is so odd.", "**NTA** \n\nIt sounds like your daughter is not happy to be pregnant and taking it out on you. You are not to blame at all.", "NTA, graphic but you didn't force her husband to cum in her and get her pregnant. Sounds like she has a problem with personal responsibility.", "NTA, at all!  \n\nShe seems to have taken everything you've said about settling down in a home so that you might see more of them in life and twisted it to mean a whole lot more than that!!  \n\nUnless you stood with a weapon in hand while they created that baby, there is no forcing someone to do such a thing!  Also, she seems to believe you should provide everything that baby will need, from A to Z, and babysitting to boot!  She is behaving like a child taking a major temper tantrum, and I hope she grows up a bit before parenthood smacks them back to reality!\n\nI'd tell her that you are happy for them, in expecting their child, but they need to remember that this IS THEIR child.  Not yours.  You didn't sign up for caring and raising a baby they chose to create!", "NTA but your daughter is,  and a manipulative one at that. I don't really understand people holding you responsible for suggesting that she settle down. That's something moms do. Even if that suggestion was to settle down and start a family,  it doesn't make you responsible for her child. And offering a down payment on a house is extremely generous.  It doesn't sound as though the offer came with a timeline,  so you didn't force her to change her lifestyle before she was ready.", "NTA. Don't give in.", "NTA - I don't recall you mentioning anything about having a child when you said settling down.\n\nI'm also guessing that you weren't in the bedroom when the baby was conceived either, nor did your daughter ask permission to have sex with her husband from you.  It takes two to tango and perhaps it's her and her husband that need to look a little deeper at their sex life and see if they can work out how the pregnancy happened.\n\nNow that she's posted all over social media that it was all your fault perhaps you need to tail back some of your support because whatever you do will never be enough.  Have you discussed what sort of help with the deposit your daughter is expecting?  I would limit that.  Maybe $10K is more than generous.  Your daughter might want $500K.\n\nI too reckon she'll want to withhold you seeing the child unless you babysit.  You may need to take a big step back there and let the cards fall where they may.", "Your words seem reasonable but based on your daughters reaction I'm not sure she thought it was a joke... \n\nWithout the other side to this story I can't make a judgement", "Is abortion still an option or is she too far along?", "ESH. You bribed your daughter into settling down by offering a financial incentive when she was clearly happy doing her own thing. Especially since you knew she didn't have much in the way of savings if you're offering to help like that.\n\nBut she shouldn't have assumed you'd continue to contribute financially and with your time if she has a child.", "\" I asked if she planned to settle down anytime soon.\" That right there puts you in AH territory IMO. They have a life they are happy with it. That's just a coded way of saying \"I don't approve of your lifestyle.\" - note - I wrote this before I read any further.

Your child is literally the consequence of the actions you took or failed to take as a parent.", "NTA but thousands of frustrated would-be grandmas who have been relentlessly applying very explicit emotional blackmail for years would love to know your secret /s", "Adoption... Abortion (if legal in your country.) she has options on what to do. She can't however expect others to raise her baby or neglect it. NTA OP. And maybe take her to planned parenthood to discuss her options.", "OP NTA your daughter is acting highly manipulative and practicing weaponized incompetence in taking advantage of you. \n\nShe accidentally got pregnant and is trying to milk you for any to all financial supports. \n\nShare this AITA on your own socials. \u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\u201d Extreme but relevant. Your daughter is going to wreck your life/ reputation into the ground until you drain your life savings to finance her life and appease her. Please stand up for yourself and set the narrative straight.

You FORCED her to have a child!! OMG that is ridiculous.  The twit got pregnant and is trying to blame you for it??? That's rich. They're planning on dumping the baby on you so they can maintain their carefree lifestyle.\n\nTell them to grow up. You had nothing to do with this.", "Nta", "NTA. Your daughter is unhinged and needs professional help.", "NTA\n\n You know what I would do? I would make my own fb post stating that you never once asked your daughter about grandkids. You asked if she thought about settling down, so you could offer her down payment on a home for her. No where did you say anything about grandkids.\n\nHer assuming that is what you wanted, does not become your problem, nor does it automatically make you financially responsible for her child, or a glorified baby sitter for her, because she chose to get pregnant. If she chose to get pregnant that is on her, and you will love the grandkid regardless, but you will not be made to look like a bad guy for her choices.\n\nPut your side of the story out there, for all to see as well. because your daughter is acting entitled, and spoiled. It is time she grows up and accept responsibility for her self", "NTA.  Someone posting lies on social media to \"win\" an argument is, of course, a sign of someone who knows they're wrong.  Or doesn't care that they're wrong.\n\nYour daughter sounds unstable.  This is alarming behavior.  I'm sorry that you're going through this.", "Yes that is not true at all. It's a huge mistake to think that babies don't need full time care.", "They may be housesitting for free, but getting pregnant because someone asks \"when are you settling down\" is the stupidest thing ever.", "Sounds like you were just wasting 6 hours a day at the office \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "It really depends on the job.

She made a decision to have a child.

If these people actually believe you could force her to get pregnant are just as delusional as she is. You didn\u2019t make her do anything. Even at 19 as a single mom I financially supported my son all by myself (minus housing as my parents allowed us to live with them rent free). She\u2019s trying to have her cake and eat it too", "INFO:  Have you brought up kids or \"settling down\" before?  If so, how often?", "NTA\n\nAsking her if she has any plans to settle down is WAY different from telling her you expect her to give you a grandchild NOW.  Sounds to me like they have an unplanned pregnancy and it is easier to blame you than actually take responsibility for the situation.  \n\nIm blown away\u2026 she posted that you forced her to have a child?  WTF?", "Nta. Your daughter sounds extremely spoilt and overly entitled. She is an adult, capable of making her own choices. She got pregnant now has to live with it and also financially support a child. That is not your responsibility. She needs to grow up in my opinion.", "She's 29 and married. You, her parent, definitely did not force a 29 yr old married woman to have a baby. That was their choice. If she thought she could just pop a baby out and then continue her current lifestyle while you raised her kid then she needs to pull her head out of her entitled butt and see reality. Definitely NTA. You already raised your daughter and now it's her job to raise her kid.", "OP, your daughter is dumb as hell.\n\nThe thought occurs to me that this is an \"oops\" baby and now she's doing her best to try and shame you into things she nor her husband have adequately prepared for.\n\nShe's trying to pawn of her responsibility on you.", "Tbh I feel like something is missing. Why would the daughter feel the need to have a whole child just because OP said something about settling down?? That doesnt sound entitled like most people are saying that sounds like mentally ill or unhinged. I have a feeling OP isn\u2019t the clueless saint portrayed here. Not defending the daughter btw thats still messed up but this post just feels incomplete", "NTA, you probably would have been stuck with the baby 24/7 cuz it sounds like she was planning on leaving the baby and running.", "NTA Your daughter.. sadly\u2026 from your post\u2026 has a manipulative and exploitative  personality. Don\u2019t engage with her and privately inform family members of the true story. I\u2019m sorry you are going through this, it\u2019s simply appalling", "NTA.

In the meantime, absolutely do not cave in to these ridiculous demands. NTA.", "NTA- you didn't ask for a grandchild.  You were just asking a simple question.  What she assumed isn't your problem.  She sounds a little unsettled.", "I'm sorry but the ridiculousness of your daughter is making me laugh. Most people who are responsible adults wouldn't interpret a question about settling down from a nomadic lifestyle as a request from you to get pregnant. She is only doing this IMO as they want to take advantage of any financial help you have offered in the form of housing. Your money might be better spent offering to pay for counseling services for her.", "NTA. She knows you didn't ask for grandkids, they got pregnant and decided to manipulate you into being responsible financially and physically for their child so their lifestyle can stay the same. That's ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t force anything. You asked when she was gong to settle down and offered to help, and then she ran off and got knocked up. \n\nI guarantee that she would try and dump 100% of the cost of childcare on you and would be off traveling and living in hotels again as soon as she could \n\nStick to your guns. You are not her ATM or free childcare", "NTA\u2026 how is it that a person that you see 2 times a year force you to have a baby??!", "NTA. You didn't force her to do anything.

This is typically not a viable option.  Working remotely doesn't mean you can stop whenever you want to take care of a child.  You still have projects, time-sensitive deadlines, scheduled calls, etc.   Many companies pre-Covid had rules about having in home child care (not the work-at-home parent) or having your children in daycare.  I imagine that was relaxed a great deal during Covid; I would also guess that many companies are now reinstating pre-Covid rules about child care for work-at-home employees.  I have worked at home for many years.  There is no way I could do my job, and tend to a child at the same time.", "I'm guessing you've never worked remotely lol you still work ?", "Yea. She's bonkers. Sorry OP and NTA, obviously...", "On the other hand, friends and family are allowed to ask questions, as long as they accept the answer they get. Mom was not out of bounds for asking a question, a valid one I think, as friends and family are generally lovingly interested in our lives.", "But the question was whether she is the AH for not becoming the child's second mother because her daughter apparently thinks she can be a part-time mom.", "Then that's CPS time.  I know a lot of people side eye CPS but abandonment is one of those circumstances it is time to call them.  NTA.", "Yeah my husband works from home and while I will leave the older kids with him to run errands (the oldest is 12 so if my husband is in meetings or whatever he can be in charge for short periods) I never leave my toddler because he needs too much attention and is too much work.", "Asked and answered.", "Mum was out of bounds for REPEATEDLY asking if they were going to 'settle down' - it's NONE of her business. Ask once, fine. Ask every phone call? Not okay. Mum has been pushing for this, she's not blameless. 'When are you going to settle down' has a very dismissive and nasty tone- it's saying, 'I don't like the way you're living your life.' Repeatedly. \n\nBut the daughter is miles and miles out of bounds for all of this, mum is a couple of feet.", "In the case of abandonment it sounds like the grandparents would end up with the child anyway, unless they refused and allowed them to go into foster care.", "Ah - hadn't thought of that.  Excellent point.  She doesn't want to end her nomadic lifestyle.  I wonder if she would just ditch her baby with the OP.", "Or a planned pregnancy with a cuckoo's intent."]}
