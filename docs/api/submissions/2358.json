One of the few chances was earlier this year (I think February) I asked if she planned to settle down anytime soon. She said that was between her and her husband and seemed annoyed. I told that if she does then she should tell me and I would help her with her house deposit  then dropped the subject. \n\nWith thanksgiving coming soon, Susan came to say with us a while. At a family dinner she said that she would start settling down. I was excited for her and asked if she had a place in mind, she did, a house in the neighboring city. It was closer than I thought she would want. I asked why and she said so that we could could visit more often. She asked if I was still going to help with the deposit, I told her yes. She asked if I could also help with baby supplies as they don\u2019t have much savings.\n\nI was confused at what baby until she made another announcement that she was pregnant. I congratulated her when she gave me a list of all the things she would need for her pregnancy and the baby\u2019s first year. \n\nI told her that I would try and get some things from the list by the baby shower. She replied that she would need all of those things and if I was going to pressure her into a pregnancy, I should at least \u2018take responsibility.\u2019 I was confused until through further argument I realized that she took my questions about settling down as asking for grandkids. \n\nWhen I told her there might be a misunderstanding, she  interrupted and said she would also need me to babysit.

I apologized but told her I couldn\u2019t do it. She and her husband left and stayed at a hotel.\n\nI then wake up to many missed calls and text from relatives and find out she had posted on social media that I had forced to have a child earlier than she wanted and refused to help with it.

It's time for her to raise her own.", "NTA - I imagine you already regret helping with the deposit.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter never learned financial responsibility, especially when she comments she has no savings. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t have the financials, she\u2019s going to have to learn to find used items for a low price. My parents just found consignment sales where slightly used onesies for $1 to $3 each. In 9 months, it\u2019s definitely doable to set up a nursery for just a couple hundred dollars.\n\nI would say Y T A if you do just fall for it all and financially support her rather than use this time to teach her financial responsibility. \n\nI\u2019m currently pregnant and my parents are gifting me a pack and play (they found 50% off at target) and $40 of slightly used baby clothes. I suggest you limit your support to similar or less.", "NTA. Your daughter needs help, but not the kind she asked you for.", "NTA for the question, BUT\n\nI think as a mum you have done some very enabling things to your old child.  You never had the taking responsibility for your own actions talk?  \n\nAnd for her to spring that to you your reactions are \"it's a misunderstanding?\"  So now you are telling them to have sex and forced them to get pregnant?  It seemed like they obviously didn't need to ask for your permission?  \n\nHow about they have been too reckless about their own behaviours, forget a condom or pills, and then when \"accidents\" happen, its now mum's fault because you asked them about settling down? \n\nI am sure that your many relatives who are so sympathetic to them can let them stay, including paying for the baby and raising them.  See how fast they run.", "I feel sorry for the baby. \n\nYour daughter sounds ridiculous. She was in charge of her reproduction, not you. You didn't \"force\" anything on her. She made her own decision. Don't listen to any nonsense about how you were responsible. \n\nYour daughter also sounds very manipulative. She wants to force you to babysit. Wait until she threatens to not let you see the baby if you don't babysit. That will be her next move. You stand your ground and refuse to babysit. She'll have to find a way to cope. \n\nI'm really sorry this happening to you. Now should be a nice time of planning for the baby not a time of conflict over who pays for what. Buy her a nice crib or stroller and stop at that. She doesn't get to tell you how to spend your money and you certainly don't owe her anything.", "NTA, I know the term settle down has more then one meaning but your not responsible for this.", "NTA\n\nWow, your daughter sounds, sorry to say this, like a god-awful person.", "NTA.\n\n1. Daughter is not a responsible adult if she decides to have a baby based on one question from you.\n2. She is not a responsible adult if she decides to have a baby assuming you will do an unending list of things... without her having a single conversation about that with you. (Offering to help her with a down payment is not offering all the things she assumed you would provide for her.)\n3. She is not a decent human being if she decides to create a life that she has no intention of giving her time and care to and doesn't even say she and her husband want.\n4. She is not a decent human being if she wants to try to bully and embarrass you into giving into her demands.\n5. The truth is she probably got pregnant by accident and decided to suddenly have always believed you were pressuring her for a child; so she is probably a big liar as well.\n\nThe first thing is to say no to everything she is expecting from you. Limit your help with the down payment to what you feel comfortable with (and what is in your heart, given how she is treating you). Do not let her bully/guilt you into one thing more.\n\nI'm not big into social media, so I would probably just ignore anything she posted. However, if you are more connected and think this is appropriate for you, you can respond to her post with this:\n\n1. My asking once at the start of this year if daughter is going to settle down anytime soon (not one thing more) is a horrible reason for any mature adult to decide to have a child.\n2. Me offering to help with a down payment on a home whenever they decide to settle down does not translate into my offering to fully fund and care for the child because the child's parents cannot be bothered to care for their child and didn't bother to determine if they were financially or emotionally ready to have a child.\n3. Anyone who feels that adults such as daughter and SIL should be able to create a baby with the expectation that another person is *de facto* responsible for care for and paying for that child is welcome to take on that responsibility. They didn't discuss their expectations with me or seek my buy-in, so the fact that they didn't do that with you either shouldn't stop you from giving them the bailout you feel they should have.", "NTA, \nIt sounds like she is entitled AF. \nIf she works remotely then there is no reason she can not take care of the baby. \n\nI grew up traveling all over as a child. Though it was very different circumstances it gives the child an experience that you can not replicate. Will it be different for them yes. But it is totally doable. \nSounds like they just want to keep traveling without their current live being inconvenienced by a child. \nThey sound incredibly selfish. \nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to help facilitate their fantasy life.", "NTA.  Your daughter needs counseling. There is no way she could really thought you meant you wanted her to get pregnant and for you to take responsibility for the child. This is so odd.", "**NTA** \n\nIt sounds like your daughter is not happy to be pregnant and taking it out on you. You are not to blame at all.", "NTA, graphic but you didn't force her husband to cum in her and get her pregnant. Sounds like she has a problem with personal responsibility.", "NTA, at all!  \n\nShe seems to have taken everything you've said about settling down in a home so that you might see more of them in life and twisted it to mean a whole lot more than that!!  \n\nUnless you stood with a weapon in hand while they created that baby, there is no forcing someone to do such a thing!  Also, she seems to believe you should provide everything that baby will need, from A to Z, and babysitting to boot!  She is behaving like a child taking a major temper tantrum, and I hope she grows up a bit before parenthood smacks them back to reality!\n\nI'd tell her that you are happy for them, in expecting their child, but they need to remember that this IS THEIR child.  Not yours.  You didn't sign up for caring and raising a baby they chose to create!", "NTA but your daughter is,  and a manipulative one at that. I don't really understand people holding you responsible for suggesting that she settle down. That's something moms do. Even if that suggestion was to settle down and start a family,  it doesn't make you responsible for her child. And offering a down payment on a house is extremely generous.  It doesn't sound as though the offer came with a timeline,  so you didn't force her to change her lifestyle before she was ready.", "NTA. Don't give in.", "NTA - I don't recall you mentioning anything about having a child when you said settling down.\n\nI'm also guessing that you weren't in the bedroom when the baby was conceived either, nor did your daughter ask permission to have sex with her husband from you.  It takes two to tango and perhaps it's her and her husband that need to look a little deeper at their sex life and see if they can work out how the pregnancy happened.\n\nNow that she's posted all over social media that it was all your fault perhaps you need to tail back some of your support because whatever you do will never be enough.  Have you discussed what sort of help with the deposit your daughter is expecting?  I would limit that.  Maybe $10K is more than generous.  Your daughter might want $500K.\n\nI too reckon she'll want to withhold you seeing the child unless you babysit.  You may need to take a big step back there and let the cards fall where they may.", "Your words seem reasonable but based on your daughters reaction I'm not sure she thought it was a joke... \n\nWithout the other side to this story I can't make a judgement", "Is abortion still an option or is she too far along?", "ESH. You bribed your daughter into settling down by offering a financial incentive when she was clearly happy doing her own thing. Especially since you knew she didn't have much in the way of savings if you're offering to help like that.\n\nBut she shouldn't have assumed you'd continue to contribute financially and with your time if she has a child.", "\" I asked if she planned to settle down anytime soon.\" That right there puts you in AH territory IMO. They have a life they are happy with it. That's just a coded way of saying \"I don't approve of your lifestyle.\" - note - I wrote this before I read any further.
