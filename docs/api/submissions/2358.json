I fully support Susan following her dreams but always felt it wouldn\u2019t be a forever thing, eventually they would pick a place to live and take vacations less frequently.\n\nDue to the fact that they are rarely in the country, we don\u2019t get to see each other in person often. One of the few chances was earlier this year (I think February) I asked if she planned to settle down anytime soon. She said that was between her and her husband and seemed annoyed. I told that if she does then she should tell me and I would help her with her house deposit  then dropped the subject. \n\nWith thanksgiving coming soon, Susan came to say with us a while. At a family dinner she said that she would start settling down. I was excited for her and asked if she had a place in mind, she did, a house in the neighboring city. It was closer than I thought she would want. I asked why and she said so that we could could visit more often. She asked if I was still going to help with the deposit, I told her yes. She asked if I could also help with baby supplies as they don\u2019t have much savings.\n\nI was confused at what baby until she made another announcement that she was pregnant. I congratulated her when she gave me a list of all the things she would need for her pregnancy and the baby\u2019s first year. \n\nI told her that I would try and get some things from the list by the baby shower. She replied that she would need all of those things and if I was going to pressure her into a pregnancy, I should at least \u2018take responsibility.\u2019 I was confused until through further argument I realized that she took my questions about settling down as asking for grandkids. \n\nWhen I told her there might be a misunderstanding, she  interrupted and said she would also need me to babysit. (I have some health complications that make watching a child a bad idea.) I explained that to her but she said she and he husband would be busy and she doesn\u2019t want her baby with strangers. I apologized but told her I couldn\u2019t do it. She and her husband left and stayed at a hotel.\n\nI then wake up to many missed calls and text from relatives and find out she had posted on social media that I had forced to have a child earlier than she wanted and refused to help with it.

Her and her husband need to grow up and act like responsible adults and not spoiled, entitled brats. \n\nDo not even bother with helping them with a down payment!  \n\nTheir demand for you to practically buy and raise their child is baffling beyond belief!", "NTA. You raised your child. It's time for her to raise her own.", "NTA - I imagine you already regret helping with the deposit.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter never learned financial responsibility, especially when she comments she has no savings. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t have the financials, she\u2019s going to have to learn to find used items for a low price. My parents just found consignment sales where slightly used onesies for $1 to $3 each. In 9 months, it\u2019s definitely doable to set up a nursery for just a couple hundred dollars.\n\nI would say Y T A if you do just fall for it all and financially support her rather than use this time to teach her financial responsibility. \n\nI\u2019m currently pregnant and my parents are gifting me a pack and play (they found 50% off at target) and $40 of slightly used baby clothes. I suggest you limit your support to similar or less.", "NTA. Your daughter needs help, but not the kind she asked you for.", "NTA for the question, BUT\n\nI think as a mum you have done some very enabling things to your old child.  You never had the taking responsibility for your own actions talk?  \n\nAnd for her to spring that to you your reactions are \"it's a misunderstanding?\"  So now you are telling them to have sex and forced them to get pregnant?  It seemed like they obviously didn't need to ask for your permission?  \n\nHow about they have been too reckless about their own behaviours, forget a condom or pills, and then when \"accidents\" happen, its now mum's fault because you asked them about settling down? \n\nI am sure that your many relatives who are so sympathetic to them can let them stay, including paying for the baby and raising them.  See how fast they run.", "I feel sorry for the baby. \n\nYour daughter sounds ridiculous. She was in charge of her reproduction, not you. You didn't \"force\" anything on her. She made her own decision. Don't listen to any nonsense about how you were responsible. \n\nYour daughter also sounds very manipulative. She wants to force you to babysit. Wait until she threatens to not let you see the baby if you don't babysit. That will be her next move. You stand your ground and refuse to babysit. She'll have to find a way to cope. \n\nI'm really sorry this happening to you. Now should be a nice time of planning for the baby not a time of conflict over who pays for what. Buy her a nice crib or stroller and stop at that. She doesn't get to tell you how to spend your money and you certainly don't owe her anything.", "NTA, I know the term settle down has more then one meaning but your not responsible for this.", "NTA\n\nWow, your daughter sounds, sorry to say this, like a god-awful person.", "NTA.\n\n1. Daughter is not a responsible adult if she decides to have a baby based on one question from you.\n2. She is not a responsible adult if she decides to have a baby assuming you will do an unending list of things... without her having a single conversation about that with you. (Offering to help her with a down payment is not offering all the things she assumed you would provide for her.)\n3. She is not a decent human being if she decides to create a life that she has no intention of giving her time and care to and doesn't even say she and her husband want.\n4. She is not a decent human being if she wants to try to bully and embarrass you into giving into her demands.\n5. The truth is she probably got pregnant by accident and decided to suddenly have always believed you were pressuring her for a child; so she is probably a big liar as well.\n\nThe first thing is to say no to everything she is expecting from you. Limit your help with the down payment to what you feel comfortable with (and what is in your heart, given how she is treating you). Do not let her bully/guilt you into one thing more.\n\nI'm not big into social media, so I would probably just ignore anything she posted. However, if you are more connected and think this is appropriate for you, you can respond to her post with this:\n\n1. My asking once at the start of this year if daughter is going to settle down anytime soon (not one thing more) is a horrible reason for any mature adult to decide to have a child.\n2. Me offering to help with a down payment on a home whenever they decide to settle down does not translate into my offering to fully fund and care for the child because the child's parents cannot be bothered to care for their child and didn't bother to determine if they were financially or emotionally ready to have a child.\n3. Anyone who feels that adults such as daughter and SIL should be able to create a baby with the expectation that another person is *de facto* responsible for care for and paying for that child is welcome to take on that responsibility. They didn't discuss their expectations with me or seek my buy-in, so the fact that they didn't do that with you either shouldn't stop you from giving them the bailout you feel they should have.", "NTA, \nIt sounds like she is entitled AF. \nIf she works remotely then there is no reason she can not take care of the baby. \n\nI grew up traveling all over as a child. Though it was very different circumstances it gives the child an experience that you can not replicate. Will it be different for them yes. But it is totally doable. \nSounds like they just want to keep traveling without their current live being inconvenienced by a child. \nThey sound incredibly selfish. \nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to help facilitate their fantasy life.", "NTA.  Your daughter needs counseling. There is no way she could really thought you meant you wanted her to get pregnant and for you to take responsibility for the child. This is so odd.", "**NTA** \n\nIt sounds like your daughter is not happy to be pregnant and taking it out on you. You are not to blame at all.", "NTA, graphic but you didn't force her husband to cum in her and get her pregnant. Sounds like she has a problem with personal responsibility.", "NTA, at all!  \n\nShe seems to have taken everything you've said about settling down in a home so that you might see more of them in life and twisted it to mean a whole lot more than that!!  \n\nUnless you stood with a weapon in hand while they created that baby, there is no forcing someone to do such a thing!  Also, she seems to believe you should provide everything that baby will need, from A to Z, and babysitting to boot!  She is behaving like a child taking a major temper tantrum, and I hope she grows up a bit before parenthood smacks them back to reality!\n\nI'd tell her that you are happy for them, in expecting their child, but they need to remember that this IS THEIR child.  Not yours.  You didn't sign up for caring and raising a baby they chose to create!", "NTA but your daughter is,  and a manipulative one at that. I don't really understand people holding you responsible for suggesting that she settle down. That's something moms do. Even if that suggestion was to settle down and start a family,  it doesn't make you responsible for her child. And offering a down payment on a house is extremely generous.  It doesn't sound as though the offer came with a timeline,  so you didn't force her to change her lifestyle before she was ready.", "NTA. Don't give in.", "NTA - I don't recall you mentioning anything about having a child when you said settling down.\n\nI'm also guessing that you weren't in the bedroom when the baby was conceived either, nor did your daughter ask permission to have sex with her husband from you.  It takes two to tango and perhaps it's her and her husband that need to look a little deeper at their sex life and see if they can work out how the pregnancy happened.\n\nNow that she's posted all over social media that it was all your fault perhaps you need to tail back some of your support because whatever you do will never be enough.  Have you discussed what sort of help with the deposit your daughter is expecting?  I would limit that.  Maybe $10K is more than generous.  Your daughter might want $500K.\n\nI too reckon she'll want to withhold you seeing the child unless you babysit.  You may need to take a big step back there and let the cards fall where they may.", "Your words seem reasonable but based on your daughters reaction I'm not sure she thought it was a joke... \n\nWithout the other side to this story I can't make a judgement", "Is abortion still an option or is she too far along?", "ESH. You bribed your daughter into settling down by offering a financial incentive when she was clearly happy doing her own thing. Especially since you knew she didn't have much in the way of savings if you're offering to help like that.\n\nBut she shouldn't have assumed you'd continue to contribute financially and with your time if she has a child.", "\" I asked if she planned to settle down anytime soon.\" That right there puts you in AH territory IMO. They have a life they are happy with it. That's just a coded way of saying \"I don't approve of your lifestyle.\" - note - I wrote this before I read any further.

NTA OP.", "I don\u2019t understand why you keep saying \u201cif they have time to travel they have time to raise a child while working remotely\u201d.\n\nThose are not one in the same or even comparable. You can plan your travel schedule. You cannot plan an infant\u2019s needs around an outlook calendar.", "I suspect you have never had a child or a remote job.  No, you cannot work a full time remote position and take care of a helpless infant.  It's one or the other.  Not both.", "When my husband's grandmother asked when we were going to have a baby, I replied, \"Do you know how babies are made? That's disgusting!\"", "If you read the comments you would see I have both. And have done both. It depends on the job. Not every remote job is scheduled and has meetings. I have no time restrictions as long as I meet m numbers and deadlines. Not everyone has the same job.", "Some of my family were saying that my daughter shouldn't be an only child because it's lonely (meanwhile I'm a single mom and have been since I got pregnant). I just started laughing and said, \"well when you can find a man for me and the time to have sex, you let me know.\" They haven't mentioned it since. Sometimes people should really mind their own uterus.", "They are just never happy! \"When are you going to have a baby? When are you going to give that kid a sibling? Aren't you going to have any more?\" And then if you decide to go for #4 (we stopped at 2, but I've seen this with friends) - \"Ugh, when are you going to stop having kids?\"", "It's exhausting really.... Because you're right, either way you go, it's not good enough. If I were to have another baby, they would definitely have something to say about me having two kids from different dads while at the same time asking for another baby. I don't plan on having any more kids at all though because I'm way too high risk.", "I had to check the ages again, because wtf. NTA  and your daughter is clearly delusional.", "NTA but your daughter sounds awful", "Not enough info\n\nIf you have pressured her about grandkids then ESH otherwise NTA", "NTA!! your daughter made a choice, to get pregnant, you didn't force it.", "NTA but your daughter sounds delusional", "NTA.  You never said a word about grandchildren.  Her taking your comments to mean that is her problem, not yours.  I'm glad you stood up for yourself.  I think anyone with a reasonable sense with come to the same conclusion I have:  Susan is 100% responsible for getting pregnant, she wasn't coerced by you, she made a choice.  And she is responsible for her choices.", "NTA\nShe\u2019s very entitled honestly I don\u2019t think there was a misunderstanding I think they were off having their great life and baby was a surprise but she realised she could try and jump onto your old offer to capitalise on you \nAnd you\u2019d probably have been left looking after the baby whilst they carried on the travelling and just left for shorter periods", "NTA. She got pregnant and needs someone to blame. If you wanted to defend yourself to those she is squaking to just say you never said anything about a baby. While you are thrilled to become a grandparent, and will do what you can no one forced her to conceive. If she wants to be mad at someone she should be angry with herself and her hubby. They screwed up and found out.", "NTA - You didn't \"force\" her to get pregnant. Her husband did that for her. Now she can grow TFU and take responsibility for her own actions.", "NTA Send this post to friends and family that are harassing you. You literally said nothing about wanting grand children and now she\u2019s trying to manipulate you and everyone around you to make you look bad. She chose to get pregnant. She didn\u2019t have to. And to expect you to raise her child is ridiculous. Even worse the fact that she\u2019s going around telling lies about you to everyone shows the type of person she really is and I really don\u2019t think she should be a mother", "I currently work remotely and have raised two kids.  I could not have done both at the same time.", "Sorry, but I've dealt with enough passive aggressive mothers to know one when I see one. IDGAF about the downvotes - I'm staking by my ground.", "Well, passive aggressive or not, having a child you don't want and don't want to care for is always a stupid move.", "I agree, but the OP was asking if she's the AH and I'm calling her out for it.", "The key is OP stated that their remote jobs allowed them to live a nomadic lifestyle. So if their jobs allow them the time it takes to constantly travel, if they stopped traveling and settled down they would easily be able to navigate a baby. Both of them are remote. I had a remote job with 2 toddlers and an infant while my husband worked full time out of the home. It\u2019s totally doable. Before the kids I could travel like they do and we went where ever we wanted when we wanted. But when you have children they come first. That means the traveling goes to a minimum and the focus is on the baby. Was it exhausting yes, but all babies are exhausting. \nI keep saying if they have time to travel the have time for a baby because I was literally in that position. \nWith the first baby we continued to travel. But it definitely got harder with 2 so we made a choice to slow down and only take a trip or two a year and then a 3rd, we are on a travel pause until they are all old enough to walk and are potty trained.", "Ah sales, that explains why you only have to work 2 hours a day.", "NTA. She was in a different country. Even if you had been nagging constantly for grandchildren, how could you possibly *force* her?", "Tell all those people if they are so offended they are welcome to help her .. she is using you at this point i would not even give deposit. She can come up with money her self.\n\nDo not feel guilty she is using you and trying to manipulate you. All those people calling you let them know they are welcome to take the responsibility.", "Ok,ok, NTA. You cleared up the misunderstanding and if she backed off then there would be no A's here, but she continued to press on, plus she expects you to babysit her child, despite you having medical conditions that wouldn't make you a good babysitter that SHE knows about. Yeah, I think you either raised her wrong or her husband is doing something.", "NTA. Your daughter is an entitled twit who needs a serious reality check.", "This should be on the top of the comments.", "Her daughter said in the post that when OP was talking about \"settling down,\" she thought that OP wanted grandkids, but it could be that she's trying to find someone to blame.", "Then she can give it's custody to Jesus", "I can almost be the mirror image to that. \n\nI was 16 when a friend of mum's had a baby I said wouldn't it be nice to have a little baby in the house and mum told me to feel free.... I backpedaled and that was the last mention of that. 20plus years on she'd probably like a grandkid but she's never mentioned or requested that I actually provide.", "Holy shit lol that's metal af"]}
