We were pregnant at the same time. My son  didn't make it until his 13th birthday, but that would have been a few months after he died. Her daughter's 13th birthday is coming up and I told her I just can't go. It hasn't even been a year yet and it's too hard. She's very upset with me because she said her daughter needs us there so she feels like a part of him is there. My therapist says if it's too much don't do it but I feel awful for letting her down and she says since I'm choosing to punish her daughter for surviving she's not sure if she can ever forgive me. The party is coming up soon and she says if O bring my kids and come, all will be forgiven and we'll call it a momentary lapse because of grief. She has acknowledged it will be hard but is insisting I can make this effort after all she did to support me the first few months emotionally after he passed.

As one grieving mom to another, I'm so incredibly sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\n>My therapist says if it's too much don't do it\n\nThere ya go. The balance between your mental health and her daughters is not 0 sum. It's not reasonable to ask you to suppress you're own grief so her daughter can experience less of the same.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re not punishing her, you\u2019re looking after your mental health and she\u2019s being shitty and manipulative.\n\nDo you really need a \u2018friend\u2019 like that in your life?\n\nIt hasn\u2019t even been a year yet, you grieve how you need to and do whatever you can to make life somewhat tolerable.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss x", "NTA at ALL. If this is her way of demanding friendship you\u2019re better off without her for as long as it takes you to be a little less devastated. YWNBTA for not going. Everyone processes grief differently, and being there for someone who is grieving is not supposed to be something reciprocal like your \u201cfriend\u201d claims. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I hope you can find peace again someday.", "NTA, totally and utterly.  This may be the strongest NOT an asshole I've ever seen.\n\nMy condolences for your loss.  You need to work your own way through this, but with as recent as this has been, how on earth anyone could possibly fault you for not putting yourself through that before you're ready, I simply can't fathom.", "Absolutely NTA. What an incredibly selfish and horrible mindset your friend has about this. Saying that you are \u201cpunishing\u201d her daughter \u201cfor being alive\u201d is a disgusting thing for her to say to you. \n\nPlease listen to your therapist - if it is too much then don\u2019t go. I am so sorry for your loss and I can\u2019t even imagine how painful this situation must be for you.", "NTA.  But wow.  Your friend is\u2026not asking reasonable things.  If you screamed at the daughter that she should have died and not your son - that would be grounds for the friend\u2019s reaction.  Telling you to suck it up and come to a party that the kid probably doesn\u2019t care you are at (13 year olds care about their friends not their parents friends) is heartless and cruel.", "NTA!!

A whole lot more time than just a few months.\n\nThe problem is, that people on the outside they forget. They did not spent every day with the person that is lost, so they forget that they are not there anymore. It does not affect them, and they move on.

He was genuinely shocked that I did that because with how much he was hurting, he knew my family was hurting even more. He was turning 13. The ability to empathize is there at that age. His mom, one of my best friends, also expected nothing because she knew I must be struggling hard.

I am terribly sorry for your loss.  I can't imagine losing a child.  That being said, your friend is being incredibly selfish in insisting you be there.  I understand why they want you there, and there's nothing wrong with that, but getting upset with you because you are grieving your son and don't feel you could handle being there is just wrong.", "NTA I am very sorry for your loss. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is being an AH.

I'm very sorry for your loss.", "NTA!  She is not a true friend.  She should be supporting you in your grief...not demanding you show up to a party.  You have done absolutely nothing wrong.  I'm guessing if you look back over the friendship you will recognize that it was probably always a bit one sided.  She sounds like a truly selfish person who most likely has always been that way, and you are a giving and caring person that she can manipulate.  Please walk away from this relationship...it is not healthy for you.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss! Your friend is being completely inconsiderate, rude, and just plain awful, honestly. This made me really emotional, and I couldn\u2019t imagine ever doing this to my \u201cfriend\u201d. \n\nNTA, not even the tiniest bit!", "NTA. She's putting her daughter's emotions before yours, which is slightly understandable since it's her daughter, but she should acknowledge that this is incredibly hard for you and should not try to guilt you into doing it. It sounds like everyone is having a difficult time with this tragedy and responding to it in their own way.", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for those who haven\u2019t walked in your shoes to understand. My son died 40 years ago & there are still some occasions I skip because they are too painful. Not only is it okay to take care of your own needs first\u2026it is imperative.", "NTA NTA NTA  and I'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nNo one gets to tell you how to handle your grief and your friend making it all about her daughter is so selfish, so unfeeling and so over the line it makes me angry. If you lose her as a friend, good riddance. Anyone who gives you ultimatums like this when you're grieving doesn't deserve your friendship.", "Firstly, I'm so sorry for your loss, having your child die is an impossible situation and it being under a year is completely acceptable for you to hang back and grieve.\n\nYour friend and her daughter are being extremely selfish. If your comfort level isn't there yet, then it isn't there and they should accept that. \n\nAnd her equating you not attending to her supporting you emotionally is one of the most insane things I've ever heard. When your friend is going through something extremely emotionally jarring, you support them with no strings attached. You don't hold this hostage when you want them to do something down the road.\n\nDon't try, and maybe this friendship has run it's course, if they can't understand where you're coming from and then try to guilt trip into you coming to a 13 year olds birthday.\n\nNTA", "She's NOT your friend.  YOU don't' OWE someone for emotional support.  That would be naturally given by a GOOD friend.  I am so sorry for your loss.

Eff that and EFF her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA...Sorry for your loss.  There is nothing you need to be forgiven for.  Your friend is being insensitive and selfish.  Do whatever you need to do to cope and feel no guilt.", "NTA\n\n\nThat's not a friend...", "There isn't much more personal than how we deal with grief.   The comparison of birthday party to funeral is preposterous.   Friend is being selfish.   If you don't want to go, then you shouldn't.", "NTA - you have more important things in your life than appeasing someone else.", "NTA and I can't even believe your friend is being this cold and callous. Grief lasts forever, it does get better with time but out of the blue it can and does hit and is as fresh as when it just happened. \n\nIf your friend can't understand you situation and why you can't come, she's not really as good of a friend as you thought. This is the very worst time of your life ever and she is putting a stupid birthday party above you.", "NTA. She is seriously out of line and not acting like a friend at all.   \n\n\nI would counter that all with NOT be forgiven because her lack of caring for you is not something I'd be able to get over. She is being incredibly selfish. Instead of offering to pick the kids up so you don't have to attend would have been a better solution.", "NTA- your friend shouldn\u2019t be bringing up a daughter with such entitlement that your entire friendship depends on whether or not you attend a party. Not a friendship worth your time anyway. Fuck her.", "Nta. Your grief is still extremely fresh. She's not a real friend with guilting you with ultimatums.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. Take care of yourself. You deserve time to grieve, and do not need to be on her schedule. Your friend sounds very self-centered and callous about your loss. I'm glad she supported you after your loss, but you are clearly not over it and she is manipulating you. \n\nWould it really be better if you went and were depressed and sad the whole time at the party? You should not have to make yourself uncomfortable or upset for her benefit. You could still send a present if you wanted, but she has no right to tell you that you have to go and threaten your friendship over it.", "Completely NTA, you are very much grieving, you not attempting to punish her daughter but more you are looking after yourself as the grieve is still intense. I\u2019m sure just getting through the day is hard enough without having to deal with clear reminder they are no longer with you.\n\nYes, her daughter is likely feeling grief and if feeling he is there with help her that great. \n\nThere is no timeline for grief of a children, you are still at the start of the grief journey. Yes, she may have support you in the early months but your grief continues.\n\nDo what is right for you and what you can manage. Even if it means asking if you meet up separately from the party if that feel right to you", "NTA. Who then hell is she to tell you what you can and can\u2019t get through.

It\u2019s not ok how she\u2019s behaving it all.", "What a horrible thing for her to say. A true friend would let you grieve and give you comfort. She is being selfish.

Are they in therapy already, do you know? If you haven't already and are comfortable saying so, I'd actually say that your therapist recommended some distance temporarily (and that they also get therapy). Then maybe they can blame & be mad at your therapist instead of you.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss.  Your friend is being extremely inconsiderate.  Her daughter does not \u201cneed\u201d you there.  Your grief is not punishing her daughter.  To tell you it all will be forgiven if you and your kids come is rude.  Grief is not a \u201cmomentary lapse\u201d.", "NTA and I genuinely hate your friend.

You are NTA. \n\nYou are still very much grieving and the way you do that is no one else's call. If seeing a child that you love, but would remind you too much of all you've lost would be more harmful to your emotional and mental well being, you're well within your right to refrain.\n\nYour 'friend' may have been there emotionally in the immediate aftermath of your son's loss, but she's not living it every single day like you and your family are. She can't choose to believe that your grief is a valve that you can open and close at will. She doesn't get to decide what you are and what you aren't capable of handling. If the friendship ends because she isn't giving you the space you need to process this hard time in your life, it's no loss to you because she is not being a true friend.\n\nIt's going to take as long as it takes for you to process this burden. The truth is, it will never go away. But the people who truly care about you will give you as much grace as you need.\n\nI am truly sorry for your loss.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
