My dad married my stepmom 3 years ago. My mom got married to my now stepdad 2 months ago. My parent's custody agreement has always been 50/50 which worked well my parents were able to co-parent well even though they got divorced.\n\nBefore my mom married stepdad we lived in a cute 2 bedroom apartment, it was small but I liked it both my mom and I had our own space. Once mom and stepdad got married my mom moved into his house. Now, stepdad has twin daughters (8) due to family issues they live with him full-time. \n\nStepdad has a 3-bedroom house. When I first went to stay at my stepdad's place I was informed I have to share a bedroom with my step sisters who are 8. When I said I thought there were 3 bedrooms I was told the other room is my stepdad's \u201cman cave\u201d. I was willing to try staying in a room with the twins, I tried for a whole month. It just didn't work they go to bed earlier than me and I have no privacy which is nice to have as a teen girl. \n\nI asked my stepdad if we could make the other room a  bedroom for me. He said he said he needed his space. So I told my mom I'm going to start staying more with my dads. I visit my mom 3-4 times a week. I go over to my mom\u2019s (on weekdays) when I get off of school and stay over there until 1030pm so I'm over there for quite a few hours, when I'm there on weekends it's longer. \n\nRecently my mom has been complaining that she barely sees me anymore. I told her I'm sorry she feels that way but it isn't right I'm expected to share a room with 8-year-olds. I also said it's more understandable if we truly didn't have the room but we do stepdad is just being selfish and you\u2019re agreeing with him instead of prioritizing my needs as a teenager. Mom got upset, stepdad ended up calling me Selfish and a AH saying kids share rooms all the time.", "created_utc": 1669820678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8trav/aita_for_telling_my_mom_to_prioritize_me_if_she/", "score": 7122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Announcing this plan on the first night your child comes to stay is just cruel. Way to make your kid feel like a complete afterthought, mom!

The biggest ahole move here was that you called him selfish and he called you selfish in return.

I know how you feel. When my dad got remarried both of his step kids got their own bedrooms but I had to sleep on the couch whenever I was staying over.

It's their responsibility and obligation to provide for you. You're a teenager who deserves privacy and space.

A teenage boy should not have to share a room with 2-8 yr old girls who are not even his biological siblings (not that it matters).  I agree there are privacy issues. I knew of a CPS case yrs ago where they did not approve children of the opposite gender from sharing a room after 5 yrs of age.  This \"father\" should prioritize his children which includes you now too, over a \"man cave\". How selfish. Let him put his man cave in the basement or as another response said...put in a shed.

Yes, people share rooms, but it's usually out of necessity.  There are multiple other options in this case.  Your stepdad currently has two bedrooms, only one of which is shared, while he expects you to share with two other people.  He could have his \"own space\" somewhere else, like in his shared room, in a shed, a garage, a nearby storage unit, etc.  He and your mom could have separate bedrooms-this works for many couples as they can have their own space but also spend as much time as they want in each other's rooms.  If they did that, you could share with your mom, and she could either spend more time with you or sleep in her husband's room.  Given the options, it's absurd that you're expected to share a room with two people that are half your age.  I think your compromise of spending time during the day with your mom and spending nights in your own room is a good one, and I'm glad you're standing up for yourself.  You're not selfish.

I'm glad you have your Dad though - I didn't, but other family helped.\n\nWell done for standing up for yourself and realising this is out of order and abnormal, please don't feel bad about not wanting to spend time there.

When I was 6 he married a woman with a daughter my age. I went there every other weekend and we got along well. But I do recall that she had both a bedroom and a playroom. I got a plain guest room. I mostly blame the mom because my dad didn\u2019t think about stuff like that. He remarried her again before he died and that was a terrible mistake. She had a fake will and took everything. I did fight it and settled but I was in another state. I also had to make sure my half sister got something. We both knew immediately the will was fake. My name wasn\u2019t even spelled correctly and my dad gave me my name and sure knew how to spell it. Plus the signature was perfect and at that time he couldn\u2019t even feed himself.

In this case it absolutely is.", "No. My husband thinks that they\u2019re cringe, too. And any dude who uses the term \u201cman cave\u201d tends to be \u2026 a lot.", "Oh it was worse than that. The stepdad wanted a guest room, so he made teen kids of the opposite sex share.", "You\u2019re giving him too much credit. \n\nHe forced his twin daughters to share their already crowded room with a third person almost twice their age who they barely know. I doubt he cares any more about their comfort than OP\u2019s.", "It varies from state to state when it comes to age (some states as young as 5, some states as old as 10), but almost every state has a regulation about kids of the opposite gender sharing a room. Honestly, I can only go by the state I live and work in, so that's usually what I quote to people. If I found out teenagers of the opposite gender were being made share a room long-term, as a mandated reporter, I would be putting in a call to CPS. That's not even a second thought at this point in my career.", "I forgot about that! Ugh! what a jerk.", "My aunt does this. Her bedroom has become the livingroom so her teenage daughter and son can have a bedroom each", "> Yeah, that stood out to me about his \"what, kids share all the time\" spiel.\n\nNot just for OP, but like the twins are already sharing. My sisters shared their whole lives because they're twins, and squishing a third (much older) person in is just awkward.", "Just to add in, most people can't afford a \"man cave\" they do without so their kids have a room... It happens \"all the time\"", "My wife is in a small competition with her friends. We visited recently and they\u2019ve got high end transformer statues in cabinets all over the house as a bit of a show off. My wife wants my better projects in cabinets as well so she can flex a little bit when guests come over. It\u2019s a little surreal having that kind of support when I\u2019m used to having to enjoy my hobby quietly.", "NTA\nStand your ground. I had a similar situation. My dads wife had 5 kids. All of them had beds. I got a sheet and a blanket on the floor, in a corner, in a room I had to share with 2 other girls. And one lumpy couch cushion for a pillow :/ I guess at least they were my age. But still. Then he wonders why I stopped coming over. You deserve to be a priority. Shame on your mother for not having your back and for being selfish as well. Never stop standing up for yourself.", "I kind of disagree, IMO it's the mom that at fault for agreeing to marry him, she is the one with obligations to OP.\n\nI do thing StepDad is an AH but mom should have refused when he demanded his man cave.", "I could see if he were a medical/ law professional and there was a need for confidentiality to have a room strictly to himself. This, doesn\u2019t sound like the case\u2026\n\nAlso, I have twin sisters and they shared no problem when they were younger. You can bet though that once they hit middle school it will be an entirely different situation!", "He doesn\u2019t need to get rid of it entirely just stow it for a couple of years until she\u2019s independent.", "NTA. I bet it was his plan all along to get OP to not want to stay there. I suggest that OP see her mother elsewhere away from the mother's home. They could go out to dinner together or do some fun activity. It shold not be up to OP to try to figure out how much to visit without actually staying overnight.", "[removed]", "Isn't this only for foster children? I've tried looking for information on restrictions for biological siblings and haven't found any with the exception of foster care situations, California, and explicitly stated in child custody agreements on a case by case basis. Just looking for more information out of curiosity.", "My dream would be something like Joe Manganiello\u2019s D&D room, he converted an old wine cellar into a geek cave that runs under the house. But he is a millionaire so can afford that luxury. The reality is I\u2019ll probably have a corner of a living room with a desk and some supplies unless we come into enough money for a dedicated room.", "Wow - the fact that step-dad is perhaps doing this on purpose is so sad. Poor OP either way.  Terrible."]}
