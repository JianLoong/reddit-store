My dad married my stepmom 3 years ago. My mom got married to my now stepdad 2 months ago. My parent's custody agreement has always been 50/50 which worked well my parents were able to co-parent well even though they got divorced.\n\nBefore my mom married stepdad we lived in a cute 2 bedroom apartment, it was small but I liked it both my mom and I had our own space. Once mom and stepdad got married my mom moved into his house. Now, stepdad has twin daughters (8) due to family issues they live with him full-time. \n\nStepdad has a 3-bedroom house. When I first went to stay at my stepdad's place I was informed I have to share a bedroom with my step sisters who are 8. When I said I thought there were 3 bedrooms I was told the other room is my stepdad's \u201cman cave\u201d. I was willing to try staying in a room with the twins, I tried for a whole month. It just didn't work they go to bed earlier than me and I have no privacy which is nice to have as a teen girl. \n\nI asked my stepdad if we could make the other room a  bedroom for me. He said he said he needed his space. So I told my mom I'm going to start staying more with my dads. I visit my mom 3-4 times a week. I go over to my mom\u2019s (on weekdays) when I get off of school and stay over there until 1030pm so I'm over there for quite a few hours, when I'm there on weekends it's longer. \n\nRecently my mom has been complaining that she barely sees me anymore. I told her I'm sorry she feels that way but it isn't right I'm expected to share a room with 8-year-olds. I also said it's more understandable if we truly didn't have the room but we do stepdad is just being selfish and you\u2019re agreeing with him instead of prioritizing my needs as a teenager. Mom got upset, stepdad ended up calling me Selfish and a AH saying kids share rooms all the time.", "created_utc": 1669820678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8trav/aita_for_telling_my_mom_to_prioritize_me_if_she/", "score": 884, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Announcing this plan on the first night your child comes to stay is just cruel. Way to make your kid feel like a complete afterthought, mom!

The biggest ahole move here was that you called him selfish and he called you selfish in return.

You may want to speak to a counselor about how this makes you feel if you don\u2019t have a trusted adult to help you process your emotions about this.\n\nIMHO, I think you should stay with your dad 100% of the time and not even go see your mother until you get a sincere apology from both her and your stepdad, because if he did call you an A H, that\u2019s inexcusable, and her not defending you is a huge issue.\n\nHugs to you.", "NTA, you don't get a man cave when you're forcing 3 kids to share a room. Nope, that is the first thing to go he can buy a shed", "NTA. Perhaps the step-dad should realize who the truly selfish person is. Needing a 'man cave', really? Those are for immature a-holes who want to pretend they are single or just want to avoid their spouse and families.", "NTA This isn't an accident. Your step-dad is deliberately making your living situation uncomfortable in the hopes that you will go and live with your Dad. He wants your Mum as a live-in carer for his kids while he hides in his man-cave.\n\nIDK why your Mum is putting up with this but don't feel guilty for making her face the consequences of her choices.", "NTA. She is lucky you have somewhere else to go and that you still visit period imo. Kids close in age share rooms all the time. But 16 and two eight year olds?", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely right.    Expecting three children,  one who is a teen to share a room so Stepdad can have his \"man cave\" is being selfish on your Stepdad's part.   If your Mom is supporting that view, then she is also being a jerk. \n\nI think that you are being absolutely fair by making it work as well as you do.    If Mom wants to see you more, then she needs to prioritize you over a  man cave.", "NTA A 16 year old unrelated to twin 8 year olds doesn't, 'share all the time.' You were not raised together as sisters and the age gap is too big. Your mum should advocate for you more. Personally, if I was you I'd be staying less and less unless the situation is resolved.", "Do some research. Where I live legally we can only put two kids per room. Of course they only actually CHECK on these things when someone has complaints against them, but if such a law exists where you are use that information.", "NTA - your mom picked a real winner", "I think you meant to say man*child* cave.

NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd your step dad is mad if he thinks that the two 8 year olds are going to want to share a room when they hit thier teen years as well.", "NTA just keep staying with your dad. There is no judge that will force you to stay with your mom especially since you have to share a room with 8 year olds. Do what is best for you. I would also tell your dad the things your stepdad says to you. He has no right calling you names.", "NTA", "NTA. Sounds like the current arrangement works OK for you. Your mom made the choices that led to you not having a bedroom in her house, so she needs to rectify the situation if she wants a change.

You are spending way more time at your mom's then I would be at this point", "A 16 year old should not be sharing a room with two 8 year olds NTA", "Wow, NTA and your stepdad can suck a fat one. Just for reference, at your age some states allow kids to choose where they want to live.", "NTA - you need space and it\u2019s not being provided, I\u2019d suggest you spend less time at moms. \n\nFor your awareness many areas have housing regulations and frequently limit the number of people who can stay in a bedroom two is the number in some areas.", "NTA. Your stepfather is being selfish. He can give up his man cave for his step child.", "Tell your mom it's not personal, but someone's got to look out for your best interests if your stepfather won't. No divorced parent wants to hear that their kids are treated better at the other spouse's home.", "NTA your mother and her husband is, he doesn\u2019t need a man cave to me he seems like he is using a man cave as an excuse to push you away maybe he feels he can\u2019t bond with you, and he feels your moms time is better spent being a mom to his children. You mom is the AH because she refuses to accommodate you, YOU are her daughter but she can\u2019t even stand up for you. Heck she married a guy knowing he doesn\u2019t respect you, that should have been a red flag right there. It seems her relationship with her husband is more important then her relationship with you. You have no obligation to visit your mother since you are of the age to choose. Keep staying with your dad and if she wants to see you she can make the effort to go to you, but she won\u2019t even do that.", "NTA & FYI this is illegal in the UK. Non-related siblings are not allowed to share a bedroom - even a half-sibling of the same gender isn't allowed to share. The fact that your mum's husband prioritises his \"need for his own space\" over & above all reasonable needs of others in the home is a huge issue & red flag. I cannot fathom why your mother isn't finding this to be a bigger issue & hasn't listed your need for your own room as a major priority BEFORE they moved in together. If I was a mum, this would be a minimum requirement for my kid/s, over & above my desire to further my own marital/romantic partner relationship.\n\nStay with your dad & if your mum moans again how she doesn't get to see you very often, reply with something like \"why should I spend time with people & in a place where I am not respected as an individual, & I am treated as not worthy of my own space\". Like others have said, if she kicks up a major stink, get your dad to go back to court to change the custody agreement - I'm sure the lawyers & judges would love to hear how a teen is expected to share a room with their 8 year old step-siblings when the home has room for you to have your own room, but your step-father refuses to give up his \"space\".\n\nSorry your mum isn't sticking up for you, as she should be.

You are 16 and they couldn't wait 2 years to marry and combine houses? Luckily for you, you have a choice where to live before you go off to school or work. I am not trying to hurt your feelings but you staying with your dad is to the benefit of your stepdad. He gets to maintain the lifestyle he wants with his little man cave, privacy and independence. Don't put up with him adding insult to injury by calling you selfish. I would maintain my distance from your mom and stepdad at your dad's for a time. Your mother and stepdad made choices that affect you by marrying without any consideration on how this would affect you. If they were both truly interested in maintaining a blended family they would not put 3 girls with such a large age discrepancy in one bedroom while there is another room available to meet the family needs or they would find a larger home to accommodate everyone. I'm sorry but your mother gets no excuse on her willingness to sacrifice your wellbeing for hers.", "NTA.  While it's true that it's normal for kids to share rooms, it's not normal for a 16 year old to be crammed into a room with two 8 year olds.  You are fully in the right here.  If your mom wants you around more then she needs to literally make room for you in the house.", "NTA Your stepdad sounds like a total AH, but WTF is with your mom here?  Why didn't they work this stuff out before marrying/moving in?  How does she let her spouse treat her child (and his children) like this?  It is INSANE to expect 3 people to share one bedroom so he can have a man cave.

Having an 8 year difference between the two is a BIG difference.  I was around 14 when I wanted my own space from my sister, and she's only 3 years younger than me.  You know what my parents did.  They built walls in the basement for me to have my own room.  It was TIIINNNYYY literally only fit my bed, a nightstand and a dresser in it, but it was my own.  Step-dad is being the AH here at not to give up \"his space\".  Mom is the AH for not sticking up for her child.  Step-dad can put his stuff in storage and they can figure out how to build him a man-cave elsewhere in the backyard or something.", "NTA  \n\n\nyou have it right you need your own space if she is not providing that you will be over there less", "I would get your Dad involved and talk to the court . What your step dad just did was verbal abuse", "NTA.  Unless you have no other options, you don't ask a 16yr old girl to share a room with 8yr old twin girls.  It just doesn't work well.  Step-dad calling OP selfish is rich!  \n\nMom isn't backing daughter up - so Mom, get ready to complain even more that you are seeing your daughter less and less.

Neither him or your mother, apparently seem to understand that with such a large age gap, it is clear that neither you or your stepsiblings would be happy.  What is worse is that all three of you are complete strangers, none of you trusting the other.  The reality is that you really should have your own room.  \n\nApparently your stepfather has never had to share a room with a young child, where he has no privacy or deal with said child getting into his stuff, breaking his stuff and messing his stuff up.  \n\nSo since he is going to have a mancave, and your mother is not going to be of any help, I think that you may want to reduce down the time spent with your mother, at her house, due to the risk of the pressure she and her husband will put on you.", "NTA.

And that was also ok. \n\nI don't like parents demanding time from their kids but then the kid should just stay with them at home. \n\nYour mum should make plans with you if she wants to see you.

It\u2019s best you live with dad full time and she can see you when she wants or until  get a bigger place. I\u2019d tell her she married a selfish guy who does not care that she has a daughter and you bet he prefers you don\u2019t come at all. Probably what was intended all along.
