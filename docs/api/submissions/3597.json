My dad married my stepmom 3 years ago. My mom got married to my now stepdad 2 months ago. My parent's custody agreement has always been 50/50 which worked well my parents were able to co-parent well even though they got divorced.\n\nBefore my mom married stepdad we lived in a cute 2 bedroom apartment, it was small but I liked it both my mom and I had our own space. Once mom and stepdad got married my mom moved into his house. Now, stepdad has twin daughters (8) due to family issues they live with him full-time. \n\nStepdad has a 3-bedroom house. When I first went to stay at my stepdad's place I was informed I have to share a bedroom with my step sisters who are 8. When I said I thought there were 3 bedrooms I was told the other room is my stepdad's \u201cman cave\u201d. I was willing to try staying in a room with the twins, I tried for a whole month. It just didn't work they go to bed earlier than me and I have no privacy which is nice to have as a teen girl. \n\nI asked my stepdad if we could make the other room a  bedroom for me. He said he said he needed his space. So I told my mom I'm going to start staying more with my dads. I visit my mom 3-4 times a week. I go over to my mom\u2019s (on weekdays) when I get off of school and stay over there until 1030pm so I'm over there for quite a few hours, when I'm there on weekends it's longer. \n\nRecently my mom has been complaining that she barely sees me anymore. I told her I'm sorry she feels that way but it isn't right I'm expected to share a room with 8-year-olds. I also said it's more understandable if we truly didn't have the room but we do stepdad is just being selfish and you\u2019re agreeing with him instead of prioritizing my needs as a teenager. Mom got upset, stepdad ended up calling me Selfish and a AH saying kids share rooms all the time.", "created_utc": 1669820678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8trav/aita_for_telling_my_mom_to_prioritize_me_if_she/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a mom myself, I am disgusted by her behavior. NTA completely. Your stepdad is a huge selfish asshole too.

Keep doing what you're doing: visit your mom to let her know you care, and stay at your dad's where there's room for you in his house and his heart.  Stepdad is TA, and the selfish one, given the number of bedrooms.  He \"needs his space\"?  No fooling.  So does everyone, including you.

You at 16 will soon be graduating, surely they could compromise and turn it into a room for you, at least until you go away to college.  Because during college and after you graduate college, you will go home less and less and if your mom wants to spend any time with you, now is the time", "NTA.

Your mom got married to a new family and seems to have forgotten she already had one. I get that people remarry, and that's wonderful. However, if you getting married makes your existing children suffer a significant change in lifestyle like this you should reconsider whether or not you're doing the right things by the children who are legally your responsibility. \n\nAsking a 16 year old of any gender to share rooms with two, 8 year olds so a whole grown ass man can have a man cave is pretty shitty. Announcing this plan on the first night your child comes to stay is just cruel. Way to make your kid feel like a complete afterthought, mom! No wonder you're not chomping at the bit to spend time over there, OP. Your mom's non verbal messages say you don't matter much in this new dynamic. Where is she on the whole, man- cave issue? Have you asked her to intervene on your behalf?", "Nta. You\u2019re right, your mom is prioritizing other people\u2019s comfort over yours.", "NTA \n\nYou said nothing but the truth.

And there is a room that clearly could be used for you.\n\nYou are not asking too much as there is the space to accommodate this.\n\nMy husband has a man cave and a small couch that turns into a bed so I can pop in and we can have guests.

It's crazy that your mom married such a selfish guy and now has the *audacity* to get upset about it.", "NTA\n\nIt is insane they expect you to share a room with 2 8 year olds so he can have a man Cave.

Eye roll.\n\nThat said, what does your dad say about this? Does he know? If you have a good relationship with him, I\u2019d expect he may have plans to force your mom\u2019s hand if she doesn\u2019t straighten this out. He may already be planning to take her to court or changing custody. You\u2019re old enough to decide where to stay, and I don\u2019t think a judge would be happy to hear about anything in the above post. I know you love your mom, but this is not how parents should treat their children. This is not okay for her to do this to placate her new husband.

Not even close.", "NTA", "Well it's half and half, I think neither of you are TA. It's his house, if he's an introvert then maybe he does need space every now and then to just be alone. There could be a plethora of other reasons why. At the same time you're also right in wanting your own space and have the right to demand so especially since they are capable of providing it. The biggest ahole move here was that you called him selfish and he called you selfish in return. Yeah he has his bedroom so he probably should give you the other room but at the same time it's his house and he should feel comfortable within it. You should all probably sit down and have a chat to try to resolve this without letting emotions get the better of you.", "I mean, you're not an asshole but he's not either, it's his house, he's allowed to have a space for himself as well just as much as you do. I don't see what's the issue if you can stay with your dad, your mother is the one unreasonable here no one else.", "I 100% agree.

And most judges will listen to what a kid this age wants.", ">If it were an office and he worked from home, I'd maybe see it differently...but no, he doesn't get a man cave if he crams his three kids into another room.\n\nBut he does get to shoehorn OP into a makeshift babysitter if he wants to try, and honestly, if I saw a kid's mom so unwilling to defend them or argue for them to also be a priority, it'd be the thing I expected to see next.", "This comment is it!! The stepdad says he needs his space, but expects a growing teen to not need theirs?? He essentially has two rooms!!

They failed to communicate and be considered. They are assholes. OP keep on living with your dad. You are NTA and I hope that your dad always has your back.", "The person monopolizing a non sleeping space in his family home, while others are forced to live 3 to a room, and then calling out the person who hurt his feelings.  Is in fact an asshole.", "As far as that goes, I'm also worries about the impact it'll have on the 8 year olds. Is she a babysitter?", "I understand the mum being TA in this situation but it wasn't the stepfathers responsibility to take OP into consideration. Yeah it would have been nice if he did but the mum should have spoken up about this prior to her moving in and her not doing so doesn't make him TA. It's not even certain what information he had available to him at the time they were deciding to move in together. He could have thought she won't be living with them as much, or the mum may have mentioned in passing that op would be okay with this initially. The mum was irresponsible in this situation and it would be subjectively the right thing to do for the stepfather to give up his extra room he's objectively perfectly within his right not to do so especially when it wasn't mentioned as part of discussions when they were moving in.", "Disagree. It's his house with a \"particular situation\" with his kids that we're not familiar with, OP got a living space, what she wants is the luxury of having her own room, which is fine, however she's asking to take away the luxury of someone else, someone that actually own the house, to have their own space as well. There is no winner in their situation, OP should just stay with her dad and that's it, I don't see what's the issue.", "Well, when you talk about it as \"his house\" and not, the family's house, I start to not really care if you disagree or not.\n\nChildren and wives aren't possessions that husband store in a box they own.  Talking about it like they are is concerning.", "*shrug* she's got an alternative, which his kids dont apparently, again, I don't see the issue.", "So if she didn't have an alternative, he would be the asshole?  You understand that doesn't make sense right.", "She does have an alternative, but her step-dad calls her selfish for using that alternative. That makes him an asshole to me."]}
