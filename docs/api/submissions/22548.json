It's better for a pregnant person to be given a seat, than to worry about someone's feelings. I was not upset to be mistaken as pregnant, it's an honest mistake. Maybe it would be shit if they don't hold weight in their stomach at all, but hey. A free seat is a free seat, I would just try to assume they were offering to be nice rather than assume it's because I'm fat. It's kind of on the person to regulate their feelings.", "as a fat person, I've held my mac n cheese belly a few times in order to get seats.\n\nPeople would panic so hard in a \"shit I thought she was just fat\" way I stopped doing it tho, felt bad for them lol", "It took fainting on a train while pregnant for me to get a seat.", "No,  a response for her being rude and screaming at him.

At least, that's how I interpreted it!", "I always took the seat, holding my back as I gratefully took it. They felt like they did something good, I got sit my fat arse down!

I mean sure, you were playing a knight in shining armor, which in itself is annoying behavior to me (unless the person is obviously not feeling well and actually NEEDS that seat). But assuming that a woman is pregnant is a d*** move and maybe nobody has told you this before, but NEVER DO THAT!!! Women are self conscious about their bodies anyway. What you thought was a gentlemanly act was actually you saying to her \"damn, lady, you're BIG!\". Just... Stay in your seat, shut up, and never do that again. You only assume a lady is a pregnant if the words \"I'm pregnant\" come out of her mouth. Or if she's in the delivery room doing breathing exercises and screaming. That's it.", "NTA, but these are unfortunate situations that require tact and patience. I was in this exact situation on the subway once, couldn\u2019t tell if the woman was pregnant or not. So I just paid close attention, not staring, but using my peripheral vision to look for a sign. After about 30 seconds, I saw her put her hand on her belly the way only pregnant women do. At that moment, I offered her my seat and she thanked me.  \n\nNext time, just be patient. If she is pregnant, there will be a clear indication soon enough", "NTA for chivalry.  good thing it wasn't me, or I'd've reflexively blurted out \"sorry, I just thought you were fat\" and gotten crowned.", "NTA\n\nShe projected on you because she didn\u2019t know you thought she was pregnant. (I know you did but that\u2019s not the point) I\u2019ve had people offer me a seat before because I\u2019m a woman, not because I was pregnant. It\u2019s just a nice thing to do if you think they should have it more than you. \n\nDon\u2019t let this put you off offering your seat. I was visibly nearly 7 months pregnant with twins and people actually pushed past me to get the remaining seats on the train. My mum had to ride a train standing up for an hour with two broken arms.

You were just offering someone a seat.", "NTA, but a very small phrasing suggestion. \u201cWould you like this seat\u201d is a gentler phrasing that leaves her in control. She still may have flipped. Can\u2019t control how other people react. But it lands differently, since it presumes competence. You were already 99% there by offering and keeping it simple.

That was kind of you and you are a gentleman. Most women (pregnant or not) would appreciate the gesture. Don\u2019t feel badly because she\u2019s obviously got issues with body image.", "I was raised to give my seat to a lady, pregnant or not.  I hate to admit it, but I love when feminists are offended by it", "Honestly, if we\u2019re looking at traditional chivalry, a guy can offer any nice lady his seat. Not saying you need to, but it\u2019s a nice gesture like holding a door. Anyone without underlying insecurities would have assumed you were being nice. If she was pregnant, you were being extra nice. People need to chill.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't ask for any information; you merely offered. Her taking offense is her own problem.", "NTA. Always err on the side of courtesy. It will be appreciated far more often than not.", "NTA. My first thought if someone offered me a seat on a full bus wouldn\u2019t be that they thought I was pregnant - it would just be that they were polite. The fact that that was her first thought says more about her insecurities than anything anyone else is doing lol. \n\nI also would probably decline the offer if I didn\u2019t actually need it, but even if I *did* think it was offered because someone mistook me for being pregnant I would simply say \u201cno thank you\u201d lol.", "NTA\n\nThis is why I don\u2019t say anything to them, I usually just stand & walk down the bus/train a bit as if I\u2019m getting off.", "NTA that byatch got problems", "NTA and as a woman, I appreciate your sense of chivalry!

Pregnant or not, a simple \"No, thank you\" would have sufficed from her.  Her overreaction does not invalidate your act of chivalry.", "NTA. If you simply offered your seat without saying anything about pregnancy, it could have just been seen as the \u201cgentlemanly\u201d or polite thing to do.

I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it.", "NTA\n\nI bloat a LOT due do endometriosis and Ulcerative Colitis. It is not unusual for me to look about 3 to 6 month pregnant by the end of the day, especially if I ate something that irritated things for lunch.\n\nI wouldn't bat and eye, or assume that the seat was being given to me for that. I'd think it was just someone being polite. \n\nAnd if I suspected that they thought I was pregnant, I would honestly tell them that if that is why they are giving me the seat, that I am not actually pregnant just very bloated. But that I would appreciate the seat if they were still willing because the bloating makes me feel sick.

I think in my life at least five or six times and I'm pretty sure someone pulled an OP and gave me their seat on the bus (unlike OP they just got up and walked a little down the bus though, but I'm pretty sure it was for my benefit). In my skinny twenties I had a sweet old guy at work ask me if I was 'pregnant or just fat' which really shows you how confident he was that he was right (I never wore that top again). If anything, when I'm fatter people are less likely to assume my belly is from a baby.\n\nI guess all I'm trying to say is that women having a belly is pretty normal (not commenting on whether it's healthy or ideal just that it exists). Think of how many dudes you know, young and old, that carry a few extra pounds there while being otherwise fairly average weight/skinny fat.
