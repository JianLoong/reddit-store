She could have been nicer about it especially since you didn\u2019t specify why you were letting her have your seat", "\u201cLooked like she could be\u201d pregnant and \u201cheavily pregnant\u201d aren\u2019t the same thing\u2026.\n\nINFO was she presenting as heavily pregnant?", "NTH! Regardless of you thinking she was pregnant or not. Which you did NOT voice the thought. You were being a gentleman. It\u2019s on her if she wants to be offended. If she said \u201c\u2026. I\u2019m not pregnant!\u201d Then it could be something that\u2019s was either previously said to her or her own view of herself.", "NTA. I stand and offer my seat to women if there aren\u2019t any seats. Period. Between the old fashioned Southern manners which were beaten into me as a child and the understanding women\u2019s dress shoes are sometimes not comfortable I have to stand. It feels very rude to sit on my ass while a woman stands in front of me. I don\u2019t need a positive pregnancy test to be mannerly.", "NTA\n\nYears ago, men regularly offered a seat to a woman on the bus.  \n\nSome still do", "Definitely NTA. Where I grew up, men always stand for women when there are no more seats available", "NTA...  I let a guy carry my groceries to the car once because he thought I was pregnant and I didnt want to embarrass him. Lol\nBut offering anyone that looks tired a seat is a kindness.", "Sounds like she should try losing some weight.", "I agree here. It\u2019s still general common courtesy for a man to give up a seat for a woman, so it isn\u2019t totally out of the blue, and he didn\u2019t specify pregnancy.", "Pregnancy reaches a point where there is less lung space and higher demand for oxygen, and this can make standing really difficult, especially in the cramped hot conditions of public transport. Add to that aching feet and possibly low blood sugar. I've seen so many times when all of the seats are taken -- especially those with signs reserving them for pregnant women and people with needs -- and someone is standing there fully pregnant in front of all the occupied seats. I've also seen old, frail people thrown off their feet while trying to stand on public transportation because the seats are full, necessitating medical help.\n\nThis varies a lot depending on where in the world one happens to be, but here people seem to show such obliviousness and disregard for other people, that when someone does offer their seat, it's like a beam of light in seeing their graciousness. Even at the risk of offending someone here and there who doesn't want it, please continue being gracious and considerate, because that seat is very important for the people who do need it.  Of course we can always ask for a seat if needed, but when people are choosing to sit in those seats that are clearly labeled to prioritize people with physical needs, those seat occupants also have the responsibility to keep an eye out for those whom the seats were intended for rather than putting those people in potentially uncomfortable situations.", "I appreciate this. I have a ton of invisible disabilities and can honestly not stand for a long period of time. My knees would start locking or dislocating and I wouldn't be able to walk at my destination so thank you for knowing disabled ppl exist without the need for everyone to have a shirt that says \"hi I'm disbled\" :)", "To be fair, I've always been in the habit of offering my seat to anyone, male or female, if all the seats are taken. I don't especially need one myself.", "Im dead. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\"I always offer my seat to my elders.\"  LOL", "The massive amount of bloating that makes you look prego", "I was taught to offer my seat to women.  I still do it.  I am confused why this is controversial.", ">\"I always offer my seat to my elders.\"  LOL\n\nI'm female and was always taught to offer my seat to anyone pregnant, my elders, or anyone with a noticeable injury that does not look stable on their feet. At 51 I still do it to this day. It doesnt cost anything to be compassionate. Nice to know I'm not the only one.", "Tf are you on about? He literally identified himself as M40.", "I was taught to do this.  I am 41.  I have done this my entire life.\n\nWhat is wrong with giving up my seat to a woman?  I do it at bars, I do it on trains, and I do it when there aren't enough chairs at a table.  I thought that was just good manners.  Am I missing something?", "I completely and unreservedly apologise. I totally misunderstood your post and now, with the correct understanding, agree with your implication that it was terrible behaviour from the woman who sat, and you have my sympathies. Well, anyone would in that situation, but a pregnant woman even more so.", "I was doing so good until recently.  The scales have finally tipped in favor of the pregnancy and it's started to get difficult to get my shoes on and to get off the couch. Still able to at the moment, but I don't want to think what it's going to be like 3 months from now.", "It is not a medical condition. The fat community has been clear about this. Those terms you used are considered harmful and pathologizing, and are no longer used in more-progressive medical circles because they misrepresent weight diversity as abnormal.\n\n\u201cThey\u201d do not struggle to stand unless they also have a disability or are otherwise tired \u2014 just like thin people.

These are medical terms.\n\nYou are spreading dangerous misinformation here.  Obesity is a dangerous disease that needs to be looked after, not ignored.", "As a fat person, I'm going to have to disagree with you. I'm totally happy to acknowledge obesity comes with more difficulty standing for long periods of times and of course obesity is a medical condition. I struggled to stand at work for too long when I hit 300 lbs, but knocking myself back down to 280 made a noticeable difference in my ability to manage. I'm fat. I struggle to stand because I am fat. I am unhealthy and make poor lifestyle choices that have caused me to become fat, and maintain my fatness. It's not hurtful to acknowledge that. My body has \"adapted\" to support my weight by absolutely giving up on supporting my weight. I didn't realize we were a \"community\" with only one opinion on all things; I guess I need to hook up with the hive mind for an update. \"Weight diversity\" isn't abnormal, but that doesn't mean all fat people are just misunderstood, healthy, and strong.

Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t!", "NTA. As a woman, women like the one you encountered make me so mad, because it makes good men less likely to offer me a seat!! :) Please keep being a gentleman and keep offering.

And while she's currently expecting her third, it was before she'd ever been pregnant and was a UK/EU 8/10 (US 4/6 I think). Three or four people asked her before she threw away that shirt \ud83d\ude02 \n\nIt's so rude to jump in and comment on someone's body and the idea that because you're a woman who *might* be pregnant, it should just be okay, is absolutely bizarre. \n\nPlenty of people of all genders have a bit of weight on their belly or can wear an unflattering outfit. No need to comment or even judge silently as a total stranger in public.", "YTA, but OP isn't.", "Try actually reading the entire conversation.", "I'm 5'3\" and 135 lbs. I had a random guy in a store insist that I was pregnant last summer bc I was wearing an empire waist dress, so random people aren't always great at judging that kind of thing.

I simply thank them and decline.", "What I usually do in a situation like this where I'm not sure if someone would be offended is just stand up and not explicitly offer.  If she wants the seat she'll take it but it isn't putting her on the spot.  I'm a young-ish woman and I would do this not only for a possibly pregnant woman but also for an older man or woman.\n\nSide note, I've had men randomly offer me their seat in the past - I don't think (really hope not) they thought I was pregnant, but I still find it kind of annoying as a benevolent sexism kind of thing.

I moved one apartment from the third floor to a townhouse and moved another apartment from the third floor down to the car halfway across town and up to a different third floor. And thats not counting the second floor apartment that also got moved to the townhouse and the basement apartment I helped move to a house. All within two years of each other. Stairs are not fun.
