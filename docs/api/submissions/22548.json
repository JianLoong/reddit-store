You would be surprised (maybe) by the amount of people who didn\u2019t give a crap that I had to stand. I actually got into an argument with one guy who was taking up two priority seats, he had his bag in the other seat.

If that's all you said, then she shouldn't have assumed that you assumed she was pregnant. I've had guys offer me their seats on the metrorail before and I don't look pregnant at all.

I would give my seat for a little kid if it doesn't get a seat. \n\nMind you, when I was pregnant and travelled on trains NOBODY ever offered their seat for me.
