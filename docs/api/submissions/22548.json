I'm gonna assume she's dealt with pregnancy questions before, maybe due to some sort of condition, and that's what set her off. It's unfortunate.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" situation.   You tried to be polite and offer your seat to her - and she snarked at you.   Had you NOT offered her your seat someone probably would have snarked that \"people today are so rude not to offer their seats to people.\"", "It\u2019s not like you asked her \n\u201cHow many months were you\u201d or anything that has to do with her looking pregnant. \nYou were simply being a gentleman. \nDef NTA, \nAnd please don\u2019t stop being a gentleman and offer  seats to pregnant women. Not all of us are batshit crazy \u263a\ufe0f", "NTA. However, maybe she has a condition leading to severe bloating, and everyone is always commenting. Maybe this was her last straw. Why else would she assume you thought she was pregnant? I feel for her, and I'm sorry you were in the line of fire. Keep being kind OP :)", "NTA - it\u2019s nice of you to have offered her a seat too bad she wasn\u2019t an actual pregnant person. \n\nAs a pregnant person a really good sign is if the lady is holding/caressing her stomach. You may also notice her struggling. \n\nPotentially as well I would ask someone in the designated pregnant seats to sit down if they aren\u2019t pregnant/elderly or disabled.", "NTA when I was pregnant with my first I was taking public transportation to work every day up until I was about 8 months. You would be surprised (maybe) by the amount of people who didn\u2019t give a crap that I had to stand. I actually got into an argument with one guy who was taking up two priority seats, he had his bag in the other seat. On a packed rush hour train with people crammed in like sardines he had his bag on the seat next him. I politely asked him if could sit down. He refused. I sat anyway. He quickly moved his bag.", "NTA You were simply being a gentleman.", "NTA you could have as well thought that she looks like shit and must be tired. She shouldn\u2019t have taken her frustration out on you but sounds like she is having hard times in her life", "NTA. She\u2018s not obliged to take the seat you offered, but a simple \u2018no, thanks, I\u2019m good\u2019 would have been perfectly adequate.", "NTA, I had similar on a train, but she ranted at me, \"I am fat not pregnant\" to me, she  just looked hot, uncomfortable possibly pregnant and more in need of the seat than I was.\n\nNow I never assume someone is pregnant unless they tell me or I see them giving birth.", "NTA. \n\nThe London Underground gives out free badges for pregnant women ('baby on board') which helps to avoid any confusion - the wearer is likely to graciously accept a seat and help, and  anyone needn't be worried they'll offend anyone. On buses and elsewhere I'll make some excuse that I'm getting off soon if I offer and told they don't want the seat :D", "NTA, people really do need to chill. \nIf I were her, I'd be taking that free seat, pregnant or not \ud83d\ude02", "As a woman, I don\u2019t know why so many women just always look for something to be angry about.

I live in a place where most people use public transport and sometimes it's really tough to see if someone is pregnant or not. Guess wrong and it could get uncomfortable. But your intentions were pure, most people would appreciate a free seat instead of making the generous person feel like crap.", "NTA, I am quite chubby and sometimes people assumed I am pregnant and give up seats. I always say thank you and politely refuse the seat. I wont even correct them anymore. Because whenever I correct, people become super embarassed and apologize and things become awkward.

Similar thing happened to me on london underground, but I was the fatty. I took the seat to avoid embarrassment and spent the time ride stroking my belly.", "NTA\n\nYou were a gentleman, so chivalrous.\nYou don't need an excuse to offer a lady a seat.\n\nSince she wasn't pregnant, perhaps she thought that you pitied her for being fat or old and \nwas embarrassed and  annoyed.\nbut her behavior was inappropriate for such kindness.\n\nMen, in older days, regularly offered their seats to women. (not that it is expected now) so your behavior was well within\npropriety.\n\nImagine if another woman offered that lady her seat?  oooh!", "NTA.

If you commented and said,'seat for you and the baby' but you didnt, so i dont see why she got so angry. people find things to be angry at nowadays ig", "Let me echo, please don't change! When I was pregnant I waited to be offered a seat rather than asking for one, as so many \"invisible disabilities\" (is that the correct phrase? ) exist and I hated the thought of making someone who also needed a seat have to justify themselves. You and people like you are amazing OP, definitely NTA!", "I did this once, I was really bloated after a meal and was getting a train home, and a guy told me congratulations and offered me his seat, I didn\u2019t have the heart to say I wasn\u2019t pregnant, I just ate a lot of bread so I sat down \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
