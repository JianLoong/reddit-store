It's better for a pregnant person to be given a seat, than to worry about someone's feelings. I was not upset to be mistaken as pregnant, it's an honest mistake. Maybe it would be shit if they don't hold weight in their stomach at all, but hey. A free seat is a free seat, I would just try to assume they were offering to be nice rather than assume it's because I'm fat. It's kind of on the person to regulate their feelings.", "as a fat person, I've held my mac n cheese belly a few times in order to get seats.\n\nPeople would panic so hard in a \"shit I thought she was just fat\" way I stopped doing it tho, felt bad for them lol", "It took fainting on a train while pregnant for me to get a seat.", "No,  a response for her being rude and screaming at him.
