Your oldest daughter sounds selfish and unwilling to compromise. Insufferable, actually. You\u2019re not wrong for basically telling her to shut the f up.", "Whoever is the asshole it honestly sounds like a mountain out of a molehill to me. If the chastised daughter was possibly leading to offering transport, I can see exactly why she felt spoken to inappropriately as your tone is pretty awful and you\u2019ve spoken to an adult like she\u2019s still a child. Really rude phrasing. Something like \u2018there\u2019s a bit more to this than we can go in to - a bit sensitive but nothing to worry about - could you please just leave this be?\u2019 That would have been infinitely more polite.\n\nIf she\u2019s just being argumentative and suggesting somebody else did the driving, then it shouldn\u2019t have happened in the group chat and daughter is possibly the asshole, both on using the group setting to apply pressure and in offering a solution without taking responsibility.\n\nMaybe ESH!", "I really don\u2019t know on this one, I would like to think she asked with good intentions as in trying to maybe find her a ride.", "YTA\n\n  \nYOu are an AH for trying to control your daughters relationship.

She is right, you are the AH: SHe HAS NOT done anything wrong.", "Yta.\n\nYou could have easily text \"I'm driving her\" and shut the whole mess down.\n\nInstead, you ramped up the anger and turned nothing into something. Quite literally, this will probably ruin the holiday for everyone involved. \n\nHonestly, you all sound like squabbling children. It must be exhausting to deal with for others.", "YTA. She asked a question and you were rude.", "YTA, your daughter asked a simple question, which was whether her sister wanted a ride.\nYou were quite rude to tell her to stay out of it and don't need to facilitate her conversations.", "Okay, I understand that you would have preferred that she ask privately, but it sounds like she just saw the chat in the group message and replied to ask without thinking about it that much, because this is not a big deal. What you commented in the group chat answered her very normal and not inappropriate question, and there was no reason to also privately message her \"Stay out of this,\" which comes off very harsh and rude and was entirely unnecessary.  \nShe replied \"in the group chat of all places\" because that is where it was being discussed. It sounds like she was just asking and possibly going to offer her sister a lift if that was the issue. She didn't do anything wrong, and if you wanted it to be between her sister and the person organizing it, why did you repeatedly put yourself in the middle of the situation, and why were you sitting there on speaker with her sister chastising her for asking a question in the forum where the issue was being discussed?", "NTA! Your older daughter might not have known there was an issue, but she should have stopped pushing when you told her to.", "ESH. Eldest daughter for trying to fix a problem that was already fixed, and you for being upset at her for replying to a group chat she was in, to participate in a public discussion in what she thought was a helpful manner.

Why did you involve yourself ?\n\nIt really grates on me when I\u2019m in a group chat - a GROUP CHAT - and one party decides to start privately messaging - running interference \n\nYou really should apologise and learn to stay out of  their relationship", "NTA  - yes, you were short with your older daughter but you called to explain.  Your older daughter should have texted privately since \"too difficult to get to work\" is much more socially acceptable reason than \"the thought of having to pretend to be energetic and enthusiastic when I am exhausted from dealing with people is horrific\".  (I worked retail and those are my feelings about gatherings during the holiday season)\n\nYour younger daughter is exhausted physically, mentally, emotionally.  What ever reason she gives for not attending should be respected.  Others should hold off on \"fixing\" the situation unless she asks for the accommodation.", "I'm confused about how the eldest sister burned the world down by simply asking the *family group chat* if her younger sister needed a ride to x place? that's what happened, right? OP clutching his pearls because the eldest messaged a group chat, she was a part of (?), trying to help find a solution?", "YTA. Your eldest was just asking a simple question which you could have answered politely. No wonder she blew up on you.", "TIL that some people call a liquor store a \"bottle shop\".\n\nNTA, but it sounds like your eldest likes to poke at her sister.", "NTA. As a retail worker, Christmas is hard. Everyone is happy and celebrating, and retail staff are dealing with higher than normal volume, special requests, staffing shortages and being left out of celebrations that they want to attend and having no time to get their own christmases together. Your eldest is being selfish and I\u2019m so happy your family is willing to accommodate your youngest, who is likely exhausted.", "YTA. Something smells of golden child with your youngest. Maybe your eldest liked the venue and wanted to see if she could drive her sister there so she didn\u2019t have to eat at a place she\u2019s probably eaten at a bunch. Regardless, your reaction to a simple question was simply out of pocket.", "YTA\n\nYou stuck your nose firmly up in one Daughter's business on behalf of the other, then like a true buttinsky A, told the Daughter to mind her own business. Pot meet kettle.", "INFO: Why doesn\u2019t your eldest like her sister? Are you always quick to defend your youngest like this? Why didn\u2019t she say something instead you jumped in? Doesn\u2019t your youngest know how to stand up for herself?", "YTA. You could have simply texted her the answer to her question. You didn't have to go straight to stay out of it.", "YTA. These are adults, from the sound of it. Your time to be this involved with their interactions with each other should have ended years ago.", "NTA\n\nAnd I don't understand why the eldest commented at that moment and what was her reason ? The host founded a solution, all was done. Everybody agreed. So what was her reason not to accept the changing ? The kind of restaurant ? The fact that it was for her sister ?", "NTA.  What is her actual problem here?", "NTA. I think that maybe instead of saying just stay out of it you could have simply explained it to her at that time so that she wouldn't wonder what's that I need to stay out of and why but it sounds like now that she knows the whole thing she is just trying to be a drama queen.", "How long have you favored 1 daughter over the other?\n\nYTA", "Your daughter had a mental breakdown from the stress of working in a\u2026 [checks notes] liquor store?  Maybe babying her and making accommodations isn\u2019t doing her any favors.", "NTA, I mean with all due respect, is she not smart? It seems simple to do the basic math and understand the problem with the original suggestion. She\u2019s making herself look like a moron on the group chat.", "NTA, but a mentally exhausting situation that zaps the fun out of the Holiday. IMHO, whoever is hosting/paying sets the time, and whoever can show up, shows up.  It\u2019s reasonable for the host to gather everyone\u2019s schedule that day and target a time that works for the majority, with zero expectation everyone can be there. Sounds like younger daughter could use a reprieve from joining the family,but is expected to somehow fit this in amongst her work schedule.  Eldest daughter is just being a brat.", "ESH. I don't know why you're so annoyed at your daughter for messaging in a group chat she is a part of and you really didn't need to call her just to argue with her about it, your relative and younger daughter were discussing this in the group chat, it's not unheard of other people will try to find suggestions. Daughter is also an ass for not listening to other's points of view and still trying to 'fix' something that had already been solved.", "ESH \"keep you nose out of it\" is a completely uncalled for response. Your other daughter was simply ignorant of the fact that this was a sensitive issue and not just a matter of logistics. \n\nYou could have said something that wasn't rude or demeaning, and this whole situation would've never escalated. \"It's not just the driving ussue. You should talk to your sister privately.\" \n\nYour daughter couldn't see past how hurt she was at being unfairly chided by you. And you were to busy playing could shoulda woulda to apologize or have any empathy for her at all. \n\nI'm sure you didn't intend to treat your older daughter like a toddler who got caught going through someone's purse, but this is why effective communication is something that only happens when you are intentional and don't react emotionally.", "ESH you all sound exhausting and insufferable.", "NTA I think you texting her separately to stay out of it and publicly saying there's more to the situation suffices and if your eldest was really concerned about her sister she would have dropped it but instead she kept harassing her.\n\n It was really nice of that family member to move the whole dinner somewhere closer though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To me it sounds like the older generation is unwilling to let go of the entire family gathering, when the younger generation doesn\u2019t have the luxury of time off. When I worked retail, I was completely fine with warming up my Christmas dinner later and opening up my presents alone.  What I did not want was my entire family making an issue of my need to work and readjusting the entire family\u2019s schedule to suit mine.  There is a certain amount of guilt and unnecessary stress that comes with that. Working through Christmas is stressful enough, without my immediate and extended family expecting me to be present based on traditions.", "I would agree with you if I didn\u2019t know that my youngest was so upset about all that she was only prepared to vent to me as a sympathetic ear, instead of her sister directly whom she accused of having little empathy for the situation.\n\nCan you honestly say that in tje same situation, caught between 2 children that you wouldn\u2019t try to stop the molehill becoming the inevitable mountain that it has become in an effective to keep the peace?", "Nope. You are meddling with the lives of your adult daughters. \n\nYou are babying your youngest. \n\nHealthy parenting for this kind of interaction, from mid-teens onwards, is more about \u201cmentoring\u201d them to solve it themselves. \n\nYou are still jumping in & trying to fix it, in the way that would be appropriate if she was 7 years old. \n\nWhich makes you the AH. \n\nTo both daughters. \n\nTo the youngest because she is not learning the skills to advocate for herself - which is probably hurting her at work, and contributing to her overall stress and \u201cmeltdowns\u201d. \n\nTo the oldest because you are clearly taking youngest\u2019s side against her. I bet not for the first time.", "Your daughter, according to you, wanted to vent to you as a sympathetic ear, and therein lies your problem. Instead of saying \"Honey, you'll need to work things through with your sister.\" and leave them to work it out or not, you took over unasked and did her bidding to your other daughter. You are in the wrong.", "They aren\u2019t children.
