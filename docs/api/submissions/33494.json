Due to the Christmas rush, she has been currently working flat out.\n\nUsing a group family chat, the daughter working on Christmas Eve announced that she would be working a full day starting from 3pm.\n\nAnother family member announced that she had booked a restaurant for all of us to attend a birthday dinner from 12pm, at a distance 45 minutes away from her workplace.\n\nDaughter informed everyone in the group chat that due to the distance and timing of work that it would probably be difficult for her to attend the gathering and so would have to decline the into join everyone on that day due to timing and driving distance.\n\nThe family member who had arranged it, responded by saying that upon this information she had cancelled the booking and was booking something else closer - only a 10 minute drive away, which no-one had a problem with.\n\nSo I\u2019m thinking, all good right!\n\nEldest daughter then comments in the group chat of all places to ask if it\u2019s just the diving to the venue that is a problem and what if someone else was driving her?\n\nKnowing the entire situation myself, I texted her directly, not in the group chat and told her to \u201cstay out of it\u201d. In the group chat I simply commented that it was more than just the driving that was an issue.\n\nJust for a bit of background, last year when the same issue arose we suggested going to the restaurant right next door to make it easier for the work situation. She was so exhausted from the previous weeks of working then that she'd had a bit of a mental breakdown and had to be ordered by her supervisor to take a a break.\n\nThe responding text from my eldest daughter at the time was \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do\u201d, while simultaneously harassing her sister about the situation.\n\nI immediately rang her whereupon she told me that my comment had made her angry and that she was \u2018confused\u2019 about why it was such a problem to begin with. I informed her that she should have spoken to her sister directly about what was going on and not sent it through the group chat for the entire family to see.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to listen to our point of view (i had the phone on speaker with her sister in the room), said she was trying to solve the problem (ignoring the fact that it had already been solved according to text messages in the interim), and refused to acknowledge or accept that she had done anything wrong, even though I said it was between her sister and the person organising it.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for telling her it's between her and sister and the other family member and that she should keep her nose out of it?\n\nExtra FYI, the eldest sister lives way closer to us and the new venue than the original one.\n\n**UPDATE/EDIT**\n\nOK, after reading all of your replies I\u2019ll admit that my tone may have appeared harsher than was intended when I told the eldest daughter to butt out. I was a bit caught out at the time, and surprised that she had weighed in AFTER the situation had already been sorted. That is why I rang her after getting my Christmas groceries home.\n\nIn some ways I was trying to protect them both, as MIL in particular can be a r/JustNoMIL at times and I really wanted to keep her mostly out of the picture.\n\nFor those of you who called the youngest, (who is also still studying at Uni btw not that that matters but gives you an age indicator) my golden child, you really have given all of us, especially myself, a big laugh.\nNone of you know any of us or our family situations past and present at all, so deciding to base this premise off a single molehill to mountain post makes your incorrect assessment of the situation exceedingly absurd.\n\nSorry to those of you who were downvoted for showing empathy in light of working in a hard retail situation. Unlike my eldest daughter who has never has to work in retail whereas I have worked customer service and retail  for many years, I understood the youngest daughter\u2019s plight immediately.\nTo those of you working in retail and customer service in particular, I salute you. I know exactly the type of abuse that comes from irritable, irrational, and stressed customers especially at this time of the year.\n\nFor those of you that think it\u2019s easy to work in a bottle shop/ liquor store especially right now, maybe you should have a look at this recent article about excessive violence for these workers in particular right now: https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/new-national-campaign-aims-to-crack-down-on-bottleo-staff-violence/news-story/173ed12c9ca850e503a581f0bb088664\n\nNB.

Put it down to bad timing and off-judgement at that time.\n\nMerry Christmas!", "> TIL that some people call a liquor store a \"bottle shop\".\n\nFWIW I usually hear that used for like, specialty beer/wine/whatever shops like BevMo/Total Wine, different from corner/liquor/convenience stores.", "It's not 100% clear, because the OP seems to go into last year's situation in the middle and then come back to this year's without being super clear about it, but I read it as the younger sister didn't go because of exhaustion *last* year, and the family is now in the process of making arrangements for *this* year. The younger sister's workplace was potentially too far from the original venue this year for her to get there for the lunch and then get to work. \n\nIt sounded to me, because of the change of venue and the OP saying she thought that was \"all good,\" that the younger daughter *was* now planning to go this year. \n\nEither way, because the other relative also changed the plan and no one got upset or demurred, and the sister was just asking a question about another potential solution, it was unnecessary for OP to jump down her throat. Last year was a whole year ago--it seems really unfair to expect the older sister to know that her sister was trying to back out of going at all (if indeed she was doing that) if she hadn't been told that.", "What is selfish about asking 'is the ride the only issue here' in a group chat where rides and logistics were being discussed?", "OP said that her eldest didn't know what the ride situation was, but OP would be driving youngest. So eldest was asking a totally normal question???", ">  Eldest daughter is just being a brat.\n\nHow, by asking if the other sister could make it to the original plan if she got a ride? WOW how bratty.", "Bingo. Trying to \u2018solve\u2019 a problem that has already been fixed, (yes,the eldest knew from the chat that the restaurant had already been cancelled and changed) just complicates things.\n\nNow everyone can just relax and know that the youngest can spend a bit more time with family rather than stressing about timings etc.", "Since when does offering a ride become a secretive, sensitive  subject? Daughter did nothing wrong  and was just trying  to help. Op could have explainedto older daughter in a private message.", "Sure, Jan.", "I think the more important question is: what kind of relationship do you want your daughters to have?\n\nIf you want to triangulate them into not having a relationship, you're making all the right moves. If that's not what you want (and if you're a healthy parent, it's not what you'd want), you need to take a very different approach.", "And if you had thought about it for a second before responding with something inflammatory the situation would have been avoided entirely. See how easy it is to play the \u201cif only\u201d game!?!", "Apologies for causing confusion between the 2 years. What I was trying to say was that last year, also on Christmas Eve with the youngest also scheduled to work at the same time of 3pm, the family chose a restaurant within walking distance of her workplace so that she could spend as much time as possible with the family before walking to work.\n\nThis year we expected to go somewhere within a short distance of her workplace again. I\u2019m not saying it had to be walking distance, but considering she works in an area with hundreds of restaurants within a 5 mile radius it\u2019s not a hard ask. Usually recommendations and opinions are requested in the group chat before anything is booked to make sure everyone is happy with the suggestion and timing although this didn\u2019t happen this year for whatever reason.\n\nWhen it was booked for being so far away and giving her limited time, there was a distinct possibility that she wouldn\u2019t have even been able to eat anything that she ordered so to save everyone the hassle she\u2019d opted out of the lunch entirely which as far as I\u2019m concerned was fine. It\u2019s her decision to not be burned out by both work and family events combined and I fully support that.\n\nThere was no request to change the booking, but the organiser did so anyway - it seems they had misunderstood the timings, so they were hurt change it.", "How on earth is asking if her sister having a ride would help \"making her sister look bad\"? \n\nAll you-- or better, your younger daughter-- had to say was \"driving there is all sorted, it was the work timing that's the problem, don't worry about it\" and privately let her know POLITELY, WITHOUT JUMPING DOWN HER THROAT, if something else is going on so she doesn't add any more to the groupchat.", ">f how bad it made her sister look to the rest of the family and she hung up on us both.\n\nWhat are you talking about? What in the world? I would also hang up because this makes no sense at all. Your eldest, a person who is invited to the same event and is in the *same groupchat* as you and the other sister, asked a logistical question. You told her to \"stay out of it\" (the groupchat she's a part of?) and claim that this is making her younger sister look bad to the family??? Asking if she needs a ride?", "The problem had already been solved though. What was the point of eldest daughter's question in the chat?", "We have a very healthy and close relationship in the immediate family which is another reason why we were surprised that she involved external family members without directly contacting her sister first.\n\nAll of my children will wholeheartedly tell you how much they appreciate the love and support that I have given them over the years despite not being privy to any of that myself in my own childhood.", "From Upstate NY and same. Never heard \u201cpackage store\u201d in my life.", "The problem had already been addressed and solved before she became involved with \u2018offering\u2019 rides, which is more ridiculous when you realise as I just did 5 minutes ago that I am always the one who gives BOTH of them a lift to it each year.", "She didn\u2019t know it had been sorted", "Why was your daughter so upset that the other one asked if it was just getting a ride that was a problem? That seems like a normal question to ask.", "Is it a secret that your younger daughter can\u2019t drive right now? I\u2019m having trouble understanding why the question was so upsetting to her? And why couldn\u2019t you simply have responded in the group chat that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference and the closer restaurant is better?", "We know who the Golden Child is.", "Rereading, it sounds like she would have still been in the same group chat and saw that the other family member had booked closer and no one had a problem with it. So she did know, unless there's a detail somewhere else that indicates otherwise.", "Regardless of all this noise. I tell you \u2018STAY OUT OF THIS\u2019. The result? Dandelient, their hackles, risen. See my point? It\u2019s not good communication. It\u2019s communication that fosters conflict. It\u2019s frankly unnecessarily aggressive. If you speak to people this way before escalation has already taken place, review it, and change that approach - as people will only hear aggression. \n\nAlways keep proportionality in mind in your responses.", "Soulslinger, I do get your point. But you're actually preaching to the choir. I did not disagree with you and rendered no judgement, only stated that the problem the eldest daughter was addressing was already resolved. Nonviolent communication is my preference."]}
