{"id": 7437, "submission_id": "10cw7im", "title": "AITA for getting my friend arrested during a traffic stop, and now my friend feels he doesn't owe me money i loaned him?", "selftext": "Ok, Bob and I were driving late the other night to run some errands. I don't drive any more, so I rely on friends and family to get around. So he runs a stop sign. I guess I wasn't paying attention at the time. We see the reds and blues behind us, and we get pulled over. He rolls down my window and his bc we don't know what side the officer was going to go to. They have the flood light on us, so it's bright as day. The cop walks up to his window and is chill about it. He asks if there was a reason Bob didn't stop at the stop sign. Bob gets out his license and registration. We are sitting there like 10 minutes. So cop comes back with a warning for him. Bob thanks him, tells him, \"Have a safe night\" and he starts to walk away. So I laughed and said \" good thing they don't know about your warrants, huh?\" and apparently, his partner, which I didn't see, was standing by my side back window and heard this. So he then asked for Bob's ID one more time and calls back his partner. They ask me for my ID I told them I didn't have one on me but showed them my credit card and costo card. They get us out of the car , pat me down, and arrest Bob for his warrant. They asked if I could drive the car home, and I said no, I don't have a driver's license, and they towed the car. So I called an uber and went home. I called his girlfriend and left her a message about what happened. Now, today, I called, and he is still in there bc he can't post bail. So I talked to his girlfriend and and she informed me that bc of this Bob feels like the $400 I loaned him is a forgivable debt bc its my fault he got locked up. So I haven't talk to him yet but it does sound like something he would pull. Am I the asshole here? \n\nEdit #1 I paid for $40 for him to drive me around that day. It wasn't free, and it wasn't a favor when I originally asked him I said if I gave you $40 could you take me here? He agreed. Now he could have said you know what you loaned me $400 take it off that or don't worry about it, but when he pulled up, I gave him the $40. I haven't talked to him personally about it only his girlfriend so idk if he actually said this or if it's just her I'll update soon as he bails.\n\nEdit #2 so for the ones thinking, I did this on purpose I didn't why would I pay him $40 and then a Uber for like $50 ? \n\nHow did I not see a 2nd cop? Well they had the flood light on and when we got pulled over I was focused on his side, and the cop he was talking to never did I see the 2nd one.\n\nSo far looking like I am the asshole and I do accept that. I can't respond to everyone bc im getting downvoted to hell and beyond which is okay if ya feel that way. So if I see an interesting question I'll post it in the edits or read all the downvoted ones to see if it's been answered. Thanks again for taking the time guys.\n\nSomeone said something about the time frame 10m is just a guess on my end I wasn't keeping track. Someone  said how would I feel? Well if I had warrants I would feel pissed off but also relieved that I didn't have to deal with them after this. I have known Bob about 5 years give or take he does joke around a lot and one time when I was driving ( before I stopped ) we went by a cop speeding and he was like be careful I have warrants and laughed about it so to me I didn't think he was serious about it.  So that is why I said what I said not to get him busted or anything like that it was a simple play-off what he said like a year or two ago. If I knew he did actually have warrants, I wouldn't have said anything obvious.\n\nWhy don't I drive? Or carry a license or ID? I don't drive anymore due to a medical condition, unfortunately.  My old drivers license expired, and I haven't gone to get an just an ID one yet.", "created_utc": 1673819780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cw7im/aita_for_getting_my_friend_arrested_during_a/", "score": 230, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And only the person on the title can pick the car up, so if you're in jail you can't have a friend get it for you or anything. I've seen bills over $10,000 (those are rare). Eventually if enough time goes by the police take your car away and either give the title to my mom or junk your car.  I understand why the rules and charges are the way they are but it's also crazy.

Be respectful absolutely, making a joke isn't disrespectful.

That's awful.", "If you're living in a place where you're so concerned about cops then OPs \"friend\" put him in further danger by driving him around with outstanding warrants. We can only go off what OP said and nothing is indicative of OP being untrustworthy. As you've pointed out his apparent lack of caring that his friend is in jail and making jokes about it proves a very deep level of truthfulness.\nI will say I misunderstood you at some point, if you're point of judgement is OP is callous about his friends incarceration and more worried about $400 than his friends well being and is therefore an asshole I can at least see that point of view. I'd argue the friend and girlfriend brought the subject of debt into it, but that doesn't forgive the callousness. He is not an asshole for any of the actions that occurred in the post however, there was zero intent, zero culpability, and no social expectations that a reasonable person would be expected to abide by"]}
