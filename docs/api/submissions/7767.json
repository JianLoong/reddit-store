They've been dating for a year and a half. Her girlfriend is a decent person overall but to most of us, she always comes across and cold and kind of a workaholic. My daughter loves her a lot so we don't mention it too much.\n\nLong story short, everyone arrived except for the said girlfriend. It turns out, she was caught up at work and wouldn't be able to make it for at least an hour. I protested and said I had invited them two weeks ago and she should have been here already. My daughter said her career has certain drawbacks and emergencies like this are one of them.\n\nMy daughter ssuggested we have dinner and not wait for her girlfriend because kids were hungry. They were so hungry that they ate more than expected and there were no leftovers. \n\nSo her girlfriend arrived an hour and a half later. My daughter came in the kitchen and asked me where I put her girlfriend's food. I said I didn't set anything aside and that kids has eaten more than I thought and there wasn't any food left.\n\nMy daughter suggested we order food but her girlfriend even said she wasn't hungry and made a joke about her body running on caffeine. So I didn't think much of it and didn't order food. \n\nThe next day, I got a call from my daughter saying she was really disappointed in me and that I should have set a plate aside for her girlfriend because I know how uncomfortable she gets. Apparently the girlfriend had ordered food once they were home and said she didn't want to make a big deal out of it at our house.\n\nMy husband thinks my daughter is making a whole story out of nothing and I agree with him. I have to ask though, Am I the AH here?", "created_utc": 1674162502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gdb0q/aita_for_not_saving_any_food_for_my_daughters/", "score": 826, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My daughter's girlfriend said she had a work emergency and was going to be late. I served the food and we decided to not wait for her.

They were even polite and gracious in the moment and never said anything. [Family member] was mad though, but I think they're overreacting. AITA?\"\n\nSpoiler: YTA", "Three questions:\n\nWhat is the girlfriends job? \nWhy didn't your daughter put a plate aside for her?\nHave you considered that the girlfriend isn't cold but just a bit reserved and an introvert?", "YTA\n\nyou don\u2019t mention what field the gf works in, but there are many jobs where emergencies arise and you can\u2019t leave. it\u2019s not her fault it\u2019s just unfortunately the nature of some jobs. the poor gf even faked not being hungry so as to not bother you\u2026 consider looking inwards on this one.", "Look, it would be fine if no food was saved cuz it got eaten, but we all know you were aware of it throughout the whole time and just wanted to send a message. So yeah, YTA.", "YTA. I don't care what you say, you did that to be petty and make a point.", "YTA. First of all given how late you knew she'd be, making a plate and keeping it warm (or even immediately refrigerating it so it stayed good) should have been your first reaction. \n\nSecondly it is not lost on anyone here, and probably not lost on your daughter given that she called you the next day, that your failure to save her food was a direct reflection on how you feel about her, rather than some unforseen accident. \n\nThirdly, it is absolutely AMAZING to me that you've decided that your own daughter was lying to you when she explained that she was upset. \nHer girlfriend made a light joke that she was running in caffeine. She didn't say, oh I had a late lunch, or I'm not feeling well, or even I knew I was late so I stopped for something.  She clearly had not eaten, but was doing her best to avoid confrontation and/or embarrassing you for being a shitty host. And instead of being grateful at the attempt you decide your daughter was lying.\n\nGTFO and maybe reflect on how you actually treat your daughter's long-term partner.", "YTA - you invited her to dinner and gave away her food.  \n\nThere are plenty of jobs where you can be held up and she told you she would be late.  \n\nYou're petty for not setting food aside for her at the outset.", "YTA - you could have saved a plate of food, you just decided to be super passive-aggressive, aren\u2019t you too old to be playing childish games?", "Late people are annoying, I get that. \n\nBut it sounds like you don't really hide the fact that you don't like the girlfriend. Maybe she's shy, or a little awkward, or maybe she's \"cold\" because she feels the vibe. \n\nDid you HAVE to save a plate for her? Maybe not. But it would have been the nice thing to do. Or, since you knew she was coming eventually, you could have thrown together a sandwich to set aside when you realized there were no leftovers. \n\n I've said it before, you can be correct and still not be right. \n\nCurious if you'd have saved a plate for your son's wife, or a grandkid. \n\nIm not going to go so far as to say you did this explicitly on purpose, but it's pretty clear you derived a lot of satisfaction from this outcome. \n\nYTA. Kindness is free, and tends to warm people up. Try it sometime.", "YTA for not cooking enough food. As is, a guest went hungry. If she showed up, other guests would\u2019ve left hungry. In most circles this is a mortal sin and you\u2019d be judged for years.", "YTA - you were upset because she couldn't make it on time because she has a job. I work in a job where stuff can come up and plans need to be changed. At least everyone I know is understanding about it and not petty.", "YTA, as soon as you realized she'd be late you should've packed a plate for her. Or handed one to your daughter to do.  \n\nWhich begs, why didn't your daughter pack up a plate for her partner?", "YTA\nTo me it seems like you think your dinner parties need to be the top priority for everyone you invite. It is narcissistic and entitled to think someone needs to change their career in order to eat at your home.", "YTA\n\nYou explicitly said you don't let anyone touch anything in your kitchen. So, clearly, it was your responsibility as a decent host to save some food for your guest. \n\nBeing late for work isn't the same as being late because you stayed too much contemplating your image in the mirror or something like that. She had an emergency and had to be late. Sometimes, during work it happens.\n\nThe girlfriend was very nice to pretend not to be particularly hungry btw. I think you should appreciate how considerate she was in response to such rudeness. Having to order food at a place where she was waiting to have dinner would have been embarrassing for you as a host so she tried not to embarrass you.", "YTA. She's your daughter's long-term girlfriend and you say she's decent overall. She also seems to have worked late that night a d it was very unkind to not have any food for her. In her shoes I would have been looking forward to getting off of my hectic job to eat dinner with my SO and her family. To me, this reads like a calculated choice to not save her any food to show there's a cost to her arriving late rather than honestly running out of food. Unless she's doing this out of malice she doesn't need that lesson. She probably doesn't like leaving her SO alone at social functions for work.  \n\n\nIn addition: You say that your daughter said you \"know how uncomfortable she gets.\" To me, this is an indication that her girlfriend is clearly not good at social interactions and may explain why she seems cold. Also, have you seriously considered that her job may in fact be that demanding and hectic and that there may be real costs to refusing to stay late when something happens?", "ESH. If someone is going to be very late to a meal it's common courtesy to serve them a plate during the meal and then put it aside (covered up) so that they can reheat it and eat when they arrive.\n\nNow the only reason I'm saying ESH rather than YTA is that in a situation like this I'd normally expect the SO of the person who is arriving late to be the one to take the lead on putting together the plate on the assumption that they know the most about their SO's tastes.\n\nSo YTA both for not putting together a plate and for your general attitude towards your daughter's GF but your daughter is also a (smaller) AH for not thinking about her GF and taking the initiative to put together a plate.", "YTA.  Having to work late happens all of the time, even when events are planned afterwards.  Your behavior was really unwelcoming and rude.  I imagine you'll be seeing a lot less of your daughter going forward, especially if they get married.", "YTA - Your daughter's girlfriend is just courteous and classy enough not to make a big deal out of your snub...that's right, and you know it.  Your daughter could have people who aren't around because they're cheating, or getting high, or out with the gang, or rotting in jail, but instead she's got someone who...works a lot, and you choose that as the excuse to snub her?", "Yeah YTA - imagine your daughter doing that for your husband. Grow up", "YTA.\n\nHow hard is it to set aside some food? You fucked up. Just apologize and move on.", "YTA, you could\u2019ve still at least saved food for her.", "why did you invite this woman if you guys didn't want her there? She was kind and didnt make a scene at your house and left and ordered food at home. While I do think that your daughter should've nade her the plate, the way you shun this girl and talk about her coupled with the way you invalidated her and YOUR DAUGHTERS feelings is not a kind thing people do. Did you really have to ask us? yes, YTA.", "YTA. I know exactly what she felt like. Being with your in-laws is tough as fuck. I wouldn't have taken the \"chance\" you gave her to order some food. If you cared enough, you'd have ordered the moment you saw there was no food. I know that because that's what you do with family. You don't wait till they are there to order food. You want them to come to your house and feel like a home, with food there waiting them. It's in these little things that you show you care, and you sent a message. She received the message and she was educated enough to order food when she got home, so as to not cause any disturbances. \n\nYour daughter, of course, is livid about that. I can imagine because I've lived this situation before. Want to know something? At least you raised your daughter right, right enough to stand up to the person she loves and is heartbroken to see her being mistreated.", "YTA. The right thing to do would be to ask your daughter to set aside a plate for her gf.", "INFO You planned for her to be there so how was there no food left over? That means if she had been there on time people would have left hungry.", "Probably should have set some aside. We all have work responsibilities and maybe her job is not 9-5. You might have looked at this a little differently if it had been a man who was late because of his job and that job being important. \u201cI asked two weeks in advance\u201d we\u2019ll things do come up and she didn\u2019t expect you to wait.", "YTA--and on some level I think you already know that.   Your daughter's girl friend was very gracious to try to minimize the impact of your poor hostessing skills.  You could still mitigate the damage and look less like an AH with a heartfelt apology about miscalculating the proper amount of food and a promise to make some special dish that you know she likes.", "YTA it wouldn't have been difficult to set aside some food.", "YTA. I grew up with a mom who was a small business owner and my fianc\u00e9 has been the general manager of a number of restaurants. Contrary to popular belief, when something goes wrong, \"being the boss\" doesn't mean you get to just push things off on someone else - or, at least, if you're a good boss it doesn't. It usually means that all emergencies and mistakes fall on you to handle. And besides, being a good and gracious host shouldn't come with stipulations like \"be on time or don't eat.\" People have different schedules, I work in food service. If I had to starve every time I showed up late for dinner with my family, I probably wouldn't talk to them anymore.", "OP,\nLet\u2019s reverse the situation. \n\nHow would you feel, if you would be invited to dinner but your husband was hold up at work with last minute unplanned emergency and your daughter would not save a plate for him once he made it to the dinner?\n\nI bet you\u2019d be hurt. \n\nYTA", "so let me get this straight. you invited her over for dinner and decided since she was late at work she didn\u2019t deserve to be served. would you have the same energy if it was another spouse your child is dating or just her? YTA, but i\u2019m sure you knew that already", "Why did t the daughter set aside food for her girlfriend? If the daughter was the one to suggest that the family go ahead and eat why didn\u2019t she make a plate for her girlfriend before everyone got their food?", "As someone that tends to run late bc my job requires overtime, no offense, but many of our jobs require it, or give so much work, and also last minute work, that if you don't work OT, you'll go crazy playing catch up (and will never be able to, which then reflects poorly on you). It sounds like you're judging her for working a lot when sometimes we don't have a choice, or need to in order to maintain that position, so I'd ask you to rethink that. \n\nNow, if you really did forget to set aside leftovers, I can understand that. However, the way you speak of her makes me wonder if you thought about it, and then decided not to. \n\nIf you forgot, NTA because you did it with no bad intention. If you remembered and did it anyway, YTA, you did it with bad intention & because you don't seem to \"prefer\" her. \n\nAnd then when your daughter said she as disappointed, your response definitely makes YTA.", "YTA. Just be honest that you don't like her. Because it's pretty clear to me you don't. Work things happen you could have set some food aside of been mindful of what was left. Its called being a decent host. \n\nWork things come up sometimes they are unpredictable even if dinners been scheduled for 2 weeks. \n\nThis past weekend my partner and I were supposed to have dinner with friends. I had to work an hour late and we arrived at dinner an hour late.  Everyone ate prior to our arrival.  Guess what, there was a portion set aside in the microwave for us. \n\nPersonally I'd rather be an hour or so late than lose my monthly bonus.", "OP - YTA.   She's been your daughter's gf for well over a year.  You made dinner, she called to say she was going to be late (1 hr or so) and you went ahead with your family to serve.   That's fine.    The thing is - *you should have made her a plate in advance for when she did show up.* Things **do** happen at the office which are sometimes out of anyone's control that needs to be taken care of right away.   Regardless of if she knew 2 wks, 2 days before.   I don't think she was intentionally trying to sabotage your dinner - shit happened and she had to take care of it.   Period.\n\nEdited to say - I have hosted more dinners, etc than I care to share, but I always put aside a plate for anyone who couldn't make it on time.   Never a big deal and more than appreciated.  Thing is I want everyone who comes to my home to feel welcome and share in the company around them.   Life happens.", "Ooof, and you say she\u2019s the cold one!", "YTA- it's common curtesy to set a plate aside before starting to eat if someone is going to be late. You should have ordered food or tried to make something quick when you realised the food is all gone. Even a plate of pasta would have been fine.", "YTA. Family member gets tied in at work. You set aside a plate of leftovers for them.  It's freaking simple.", "YTA.  And don\u2019t think for a second that your daughter & her gf don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t like her. You dislike her so much you can\u2019t even come up with a fake name.", "As the host, you should've put a plate aside knowing a guest would be late. HOWEVER, the same could be said for your daughter. She suggested everyone eat, she could've put her gf a plate aside. I've done that for my husband but it sounds like she automatically assumed you do it. So not really an AH but kindof rude!", "YTA. It seems like you\u2019re not fond of your daughter\u2019s girlfriend, and you did this to be petty.", "Nta. Your daughter could have gone into the kitchen and fixed her gf a plate.", "Going against the grain here but solely based on this post, I\u2019ll say NTA. You can\u2019t arrive to a family dinner an hour and a half late and expect food to still be there. If it was a restaurant, then yes - more food can always be ordered later/ an order for this person could be taken home. But family dinner? The meal is limited. If the girlfriend knew in advance (prior to the prepping of the meal) that she MIGHT be late, she should\u2019ve let the daughter know asap so she could communicate this with OP and arrange to have more food made, and specifically set aside some for the gf, OR daughter could have also suggested setting aside some food for her gf when she suggested eating without her.", "NTA. Dinner was set for a certain time. The time was known to everyone. You were given permission by your daughter to begin serving. Her girlfriend was 1.5 hours late in arriving. The food wasn't thrown out, it was eaten. Them's the breaks. Next time, be on time and you might get to eat. In the alternative, the daughter can set aside something for her. Either way, you weren't at fault.", "NTA, and I do not understand these Y-T-A votes.  Why was it your responsibility to put the food aside for your daughter\u2019s girlfriend?  If it was such a big deal, your daughter should have put some food aside herself.  She\u2018s a big girl.  This also seems like a reoccurring issue, so your daughter was definitely aware of it.  Besides, she was an hour and a half late for dinner at someone else\u2019s house\u2014why would you assume there would be food left over?", "She didn't get supper because she DIDN'T SHOW up for the supper. She showed up over an hour late expecting food? No", "Info: how was dinner served?  Was it family style or did you put food on each person\u2019s plate?\n\nReason why I\u2019m asking is if it\u2019s family style I\u2019m confuse why your daughter didn\u2019t prepare a plate for her partner herself.", "NTA- everyone is saying they should have set aside some food for the girlfriend but the daughter is an adult and should have the common sense to make sure their significant other has something ahead of time", "ESH, Mother for not ensuring there was enough food and being a proper host, daughter for not ensuring a plate was prepared for her girlfriend, and lastly the girlfriend for being late to a meal that had been planned so far in advance.", "YTA just for your utter lack of empathy for your daughter's girlfriend. Regardless of whether you \"should\" have set aside a plate for her - I happen to think a good host would have, but you do you - your disdain for her is so clear in this post and your comments, and I can't help but think it colored the way you treated her and the ease with which you (and your husband) dismissed your daughter's concerns. But now your daughter sees your true colors, so there's that, at least.", "YTA if daughter was dating a male doctor, I bet OP would be \u201cunderstanding\u201d and respectful about the demands of his job and set aside a plate", "YTA\u2026 are you even serious? how do you and your husband not see how rude this is\u2026 sorry to your daughter and her girlfriend for having to explain how this is wrong.", "Hey my mom acts just like you do and, guess what? I hardly talk to her anymore because she's so toxic.\n\nYTA.", "Im gonna say NTA for this specific scenario but you do seem like an AH in general in regards to this GF. You ran out of food. It would have been nice to save a plate, but that should have been on your daughter to at least ask about before people had seconds. Your mind was preoccupied with serving the guests who were there. However, you\u2019re certainly not any sort of nice or sweet. Like my mom is a sweet lady. She absolutely would have A) not been annoyed at a partner working late and B) made sure to have set aside some food for the person running late. Not sure if you care about being nice, but at least technically youre not an AH in this specific scenario.", "YTA\n\nYou don't like her and you were subtly (or not so subtly) making a point with the lack of food. \n\nYour daughter's gf handled the situation admirably by downplaying and joking about it so as to not cause a scene. She knows full well you don't like her, but she loves your daughter and is being gracious for her sake, not yours. \n\nI hope they go no contact with you.", "So you knew she was still coming, right? And straight from work, so she would be hungry? I have to go YTA because I don't really understand how you thought this would go. It's almost like you thought she was lying or something. Also couldn't you have made her something once you realized she hadn't eaten dinner?", "Yep YTA\n\nShe was a guest. She\u2019s notified you she would be an hour late - your responsibility at that moment was to either put a dish aside for her, or tell your daughter to tell her gf to not rush and to just get take out later. \n\nYou did neither and went for the rudest possible action. Guarantee she rushed to try and finish her work quickly and get to your house. But you were too much of anxasshole to be considerate.", "NTA\n\nespecially if this is a reoccuring topic. If I was in your daughters situation, I would have made the effort to set something aside for my partner. Also, its seems that you were willing to order food after, therefor I would argue that you were still trying to be accomodating. If that offer is then denied, I don't think this has anything to do witch you anymore", "Nta your daughter should have set a plate aside for HER partner", "ESH - You knew she was still coming and would be hungry after having worked a very long day so it would have been the hostly thing to do but you chose to be rude instead. Also if you invited her and cooked like she was going to be there, there should have been plenty of food available unless you are really just \\*that bad\\* at dinner parties. However, I think the fault really lies on your daughter to save her partner a plate of food. Sure it was rude of the gf to be late but work things happen, and you haven't mentioned her profession so I am operating under the possibility that is it something important like healthcare or that there was an emergency or hot deadline approaching.", "NTA- your daughter should have made a plate for her girlfriend. \nI have been to my Mom's house plenty when my husband had a last minute emergency to tend to (on-site maintenance) \nI make him a plate and set it aside to bring home.", "NTA.

You're running a home.\n\nAdd to that that it was your daughter's idea not to wait and this is as much her fault as anyone else's.\n\nWhat would have stopped your daughter from putting a plate together for her GF if she was concerned about it?

They've been dating for a year and a half. Her girlfriend is a decent person overall but to most of us, she always comes across and cold and kind of a workaholic. My daughter loves her a lot so we don't mention it too much.\n\nLong story short, everyone arrived except for the said girlfriend. It turns out, she was caught up at work and wouldn't be able to make it for at least an hour. I protested and said I had invited them two weeks ago and she should have been here already. My daughter said her career has certain drawbacks and emergencies like this are one of them.\n\nMy daughter ssuggested we have dinner and not wait for her girlfriend because kids were hungry. They were so hungry that they ate more than expected and there were no leftovers. \n\nSo her girlfriend arrived an hour and a half later. My daughter came in the kitchen and asked me where I put her girlfriend's food. I said I didn't set anything aside and that kids has eaten more than I thought and there wasn't any food left.\n\nMy daughter suggested we order food but her girlfriend even said she wasn't hungry and made a joke about her body running on caffeine. So I didn't think much of it and didn't order food. \n\nThe next day, I got a call from my daughter saying she was really disappointed in me and that I should have set a plate aside for her girlfriend because I know how uncomfortable she gets. Apparently the girlfriend had ordered food once they were home and said she didn't want to make a big deal out of it at our house.\n\nMy husband thinks my daughter is making a whole story out of nothing and I agree with him.

If you invite lots of people to dinner there should always be enough food.  What if the GF had been on time? The kids would be hungry.  When you saw the food was all gone,  you knew the GF was coming later. Why didn't you make plans? At the very least, let her know to grab something before coming, even if you couldn't be bothered to make something or let your daughter order something ahead. Many options that didn't include letting a guest turn up for dinner after a long shift and not making any effort to give her dinner. I bet if it had been your child or your husband, you would have saved some or done something other than just shrug.\nIf she was off drinking or not bothering to come,  you could have been given some leeway, but you say she was working in a job that has emergencies.

He\u2019s done it a few times for me at his fam\u2019s house because I have a more limited diet, but it\u2019s also a norm in our families (and perhaps southern US?) to make more food than needed for the number of guests. Very rarely do family dinners have zero leftovers.", "Truly asking, not criticizing. Even if the guest was a child of the host, even after they've moved out? I ask because after we moved out when we went home it was like we never left so there was no restricted access. It was like we were hosts by extension, if that makes sense. Especially if the missing person was a child's SO.", "Well that is a very reasonable answer. Yep. OP is TA.", "Yeah, it\u2019s probably cultural. It would be really scummy for me to ask my parents to set aside a plate for my SO rather than doing it myself. My SO would blame me, never the host.", "Poking around?? This is her parents\u2019 house lmao", "Well shit that changes things some then from NTA to ESH for me because girlfriend should have asked her mom to put her SO plates to the side. Showing up over an hour late to dinner is shitty too since dinner is over so she really just should not have come. Op because who doesnt even let their own adult child in their kitchen thats a bit much.", "I know that, but ArtShapiro, the person I was replying to clearly didn't.", "This is the question asked of OP in a comment\n\n\"Why didn't your daughter put a plate aside for her?\"\n \nThis was OP's response.\n\n\"I don't really let anyone touch anything in my kitchen when I'm hosting so it's my bad\"\n\nAs far as the daughter going into the kitchen my guess is OP is fine with people being in there once she's finished serving and washing up, just not while the food is still on the stove and in the oven.", "Jesus I work at an office job and my job is mostly admin.\n\nI had the unenviable job recently of pulling in my 2 up, 3 up, CEO and the entire legal team early from their Christmas holidays because I discovered a serious issue that needed addressing and couldn't wait.\n\nJust because she's in a corporate office job doesn't mean she's on cruise mode.", "Obviously mom never worked in an office environment. And, of course, this is her skewed side of things. Office workers have deadlines. Sometimes they are moved up by higher ups, sometimes unexpected problems arise.

It was absolutely fine not to wait for her, but OP could have put aside a plate of food.", "Scottish here, and I completely agree. My entire family would never let me live down that someone left my house hungry.", "agree, this was my mom. No one ever left her house hungry or empty handed.", "My Hoosier ass having a STROKE\n\nThe egregious lack of hospitality is truly offensive to me. Lettin someone go hungry. For shame.

It's what a gracious dinner host does.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. We're glad you're here. You must be hungry.

I feel like the girlfriend being stuck at work (AKA contributing to a living situation with their own daughter) should\u2019ve been taken more into consideration", "But to me, it doesn't sound like the host had enough food. If the GF had arrived on time someone would have gone home hungry.", "They didn\u2019t even let the daughter know they ran out of food. That\u2019s so sketch. Maybe daughter could have gone and made some pasta or something if she\u2019d been told the food was gone. Instead they just didn\u2019t say anything until she went to get her girlfriend some food.", "NTA- The girlfriend was invited for a FAMILY dinner. She showed up one your and half late (which is beyond rude) s\u00f3, It wasn't a family dinner anymore. The girlfriend should have saved something If she was so worried...", "That's my question, too. Was it an actual emergency or is the girlfriend just a workaholic? \n\nMy judgement may be colored from having been in a relationship with a workaholic, but if it wasn't a legitimate emergency and was just the girlfriend prioritizing her job over the people in her life, then not getting to eat dinner is a natural consequence of that. If you want to eat a dinner someone else prepared, maybe try remembering that everyone else's life doesn't revolve around your job the way your life does. \n\nIf she's a cardiac surgeon who got held up late performing open heart surgery, then yeah, ffs save the woman a plate and make sure there's extra dessert, too.", "Not condoning OP here, because she should have at the least ordered something when she realized the kids at all the food, but my kids have done this. I\u2019ve made what I think is a reasonable amount of food for my husband, myself, and our two kids (as our third is still an infant) and then I\u2019m blown away because they wanted thirds and fourths when they rarely even eat seconds. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

It would be different if the GF was a disorganised , flakey, chronically late person from just being lazy and nor respecting other people's time. In our extended family (on both side) we have an ENT surgeon, pediatric nurse, paramedic and a cousin who works in immigration law doing something with children from conflict zone, (idk exactly what that cousin does but he is on call basically always and has to leave/work back at the drop of the hat)  Being aware of this we know that we might sometimes have to put food aside if they are late. It is the nature of being in a family with differing jobs that don't follow the 9-5 routine. OP YTA for not making the very simple accommodation of setting a plate aside when he knew that the long term partner of his child was late (through no fault of her own) especially when daughter did not make the family wait for her GF, and the GF was gracious enough not to cause a scene and politely declined to order food as to not be an imposition.", "IMO it is the difference between family/friends and a more formal guest.", "But she did the last part.  She joined for family time and then ordered food later.  She was perfectly polite.\n\nIt is the daughter who is calling her mom out here for not being kinder to her SO.  OP doesn't tell us enough about their family dynamics for me to really know if the daughter has a point here or not.", "She communicated in advance she would be late. OP didn\u2019t communicate being late means no food. If I\u2019m cooking and someone is late, I don\u2019t give away or trash their food, I put up a plate, which is the non A H thing to do.", "Exately. I would have cancelled too. An hour and half later it's too much. People (especially with Young children) migh be getting ready to go home.", "So how did all the other guests get food? Did OP make everyone their plate while they sat at the table?", "My grandma would have a stroke if she read this. A child wants more dinner and you make them a sandwich instead? That's maybe a culture thing, but I would never refuse someone another serving if there is still food left.\n\nIf course food for people running late is set aside at the beginning and doesn't count", "But she didn't. She even refused the offer of takeout even though she was hungry. It was the daughter who made the comment.\n\nBut I've never been to a family dinner where a plate wasn't set aside for latecomers, but that's my family.", "Her late arrival was announced ahead of time. She didn't just show up late without anyone knowing it was gonna happen or why.\n\nAnd, what did she do? She didn't make a fuss and ordered food when she got home. Like the good guest you think she isn't.", "She didn't.  OP's daughter is calling her out on being kind to daughter's SO.", "Really..? At my family, when there was an announced problem (so not out of rudeness, but for a valid and unpredictable reason), food was always saved for the person. They are family SO and/or friends, not strangers... Maybe in other countries is different, I don't know, in Italy it would be strange to make someone not have dinner in your home after they were expecting to... have dinner. It is considered justifiable if you announced and/or the reason was impossible to predict. But regardless of that, if you were waiting for food, you will have your food. \ud83d\ude02", "Nah she should have made her lowly office grunts stay alone.", "Maybe people were eating it because it was there, not because they weren't full. Not that I've ever overeaten at Christmas. Or Thanksgiving. Or, that time last week. Or...", "So OP is a double AH for not cooking enough food to accommodate her guests", "No. The kids are more than they were served. That could have been set aside.", "Yeah, I also wouldn't think to ask about saving a plate because the host cooked assuming the late guest would he there so there should have been enough food regardless???", "This! Someone was going hungry if girlfriend was on time, host didn\u2019t cook enough food, probably as she planned to create drama", "Yep. Bad host, because it\u2019s better to have a little more than you would need than less, but NTA.", "The daughter says that she's in a field where emergencies crop up.\n\nWe don't know the field exactly but off the top of my head: emergency workers, doctors, lawyers, childcare, welfare workers etc all have emergencies where you can't just stop work and walk away.\n\nIt's not rudeness if you have a genuine work emergency, in the same way it wouldn't be rude if her car broke down en route.", ">The girlfriend should have saved something If she was so worried... \n\nI guess this is very much dependant in your family. My mother would just instinctively keep something as she's a feeder. I wouldn't think of having to be the one to keep something.", "Key word DINNER. She was late for timing...because she worked late...and did not eat...expecting dinner...which she still attended...even though she worked late. There's a clear asshole here and it is very obviously OP", "I personally would have offered to reschedule dinner with my daughter and her girlfriend for another day when her girlfriend could make it. The daughter could either join for a a quick dinner or choose to skip and wait until the dinner that both can attend. This solution avoids all the drama.", "I kind of agree there.  Daughter should have made sure the plate of food was set aside instead of relying on OP.  But then, maybe she doesn't realize how little her mother likes her girlfriend.", "Some people have careers; for people with careers it sometimes means you have to work late (even though you really don\u2019t want to) or miss events. GF communicated something come up and that she would arrive late, GF followed through on that commitment and was then punished for having a career by being given nothing to eat. I suspect OP is a homophobe who hopes they can turn their daughter \u2018straight\u2019 by driving away their GF. \n\nOP in case it\u2019s not clear YTA.", "its rude if they just didnt give a shit, including if they didnt really need to stay late but prioritised work anyway, but i get the impression that wasnt the issue, mum wanted to make it difficult as a punishment.", "I\u2019m a healthcare worker, some times you need to prioritise. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of other professions that have time sensitive issues", "Not disagreeing with everything but sometimes you CANT get out of work on time. At least if you do more than minimum effort at work", "They probably don\u2019t like her. It\u2019s possible the family is homophobic(she\u2019s at the age where that\u2019s not uncommon) but she probably didn\u2019t think About it", "OP said no one else is allowed to touch anything in her kitchen. Why are you questioning the person above you like you don\u2019t believe them? It\u2019s what OP said. She\u2019s  only made like two comments so it\u2019s easy to find.\n\nAlso, no one needs to set a special plate aside unless there\u2019s not enough food so they have to set some aside ahead of time in order to make sure there\u2019s some left.

They should have set the food aside instead of letting the children eat it.\n\nThe food shouldn't have been available because it should've been saved for her.", "Yeah, I'm Finnish and definitely if you'd invited someone over for dinner and they ended up running late, some food would be set aside for them so they could warm it up once they got there. And if you somehow unexpectedly ran out of food in the meanwhile (which obvs shouldn't happen), you'd at least let them know so they could grab something to eat on the way and wouldn't have to go hungry. Waiting for them to come over only to tell them all the food had been eaten would be very rude. All the more so when said person is coming directly from work, and from working overtime at that.", "Exactly!!! That\u2019s what happens when family gets together for dinner. You eat! Host schmost, the girlfriend should\u2019ve made her a plate.", "What I want to know is why didn\u2019t the GF make a plate for her \ud83d\ude44", "Plenty of other fields where work emergencies exist.  Ex... your relief is late/didnt show, you have a project that was due today but it's not finished by the end of the day and its required/expected that you stay late to complete your assigned tasks.", "OP also doesn't state the GF's career, which makes me think something in the medical field which does tend to deal with emergencies and the ones I know are massive caffeine junkies. If they even knew this was a possibility, they should have set a plate aside for her.  I agree with the idea that they're homophobes.", "I mean...I have a career that has me on call and constantly either having to cancel or be late.  I, in no way, expect people to wait for me or set food aside.  If they do....great!  If not, I just grab something for myself on the way there, or order something once I get there.  Or, I use my Big Girl words and ask that somebody please order for me/set something aside for me.  Sounds like OP's daughter and her GF didn't communicate what their alternative dinner plan would be, which....isn't really on OP.  I suppose in a perfect world, OP should have asked: \"oh, does she want us to leave something aside for her, or is she planning on doing her own thing?\"  Because hey...maybe she's just gonna eat at the office, rather than go hungry for an extra hour and a half.\n\nI think it's a far cry to go from \"not asking a fully-grown adult what their alternative dinner plans will be\" to \"career-women-hating homophobe, trying to turn his daughter straight\".", "Jesus Christ what?\n\nNo one is penalizing the girlfriend for having a career. The girlfriend prioritized her career over this family dinner, which she has every right to do, but I\u2019m not sure why the daughter would just expect that her girlfriend be fed when she did that and didn\u2019t come for family dinner though. Mom isn\u2019t a restaurant. \n\nAnd Mom is a homophobe? What? If girlfriend was at dinner, she would have eaten lol. What a weird thing to conclude. Mom is a homophobe so she intentionally made less food and hoped the kids would be hungry so that they\u2019d finish it all, in the hopes that the girlfriend comes late and won\u2019t be able to eat any? \n\nShe\u2019s a bad host for not having enough food, but NTA.", "Your logic turned incredibly stupid as soon as you used it as an excuse to call someone a homophobe lol.", "Oh I understand that. Those were just examples I thought of off the top of my head.", "I also feel as a man, I\u2019m generally celebrated and sympathized with when I have had to work late but current (and ex partners) and their families.

Mom doesn\u2019t like GF, complains / belittles her having a career and deliberately does something to hurt GF (not cooking enough food and not saving her a plate) - it doesn\u2019t mean she is homophobic but it\u2019s more likely a homophobe does those things to their child\u2019s same sex partner than a nice normal person.", "My bad, Didn't mean to be a combative tone.  Just adding onto yours.", "I thought it was interesting that OP did not mention what exactly that job is that the gf is doing.

Part of having such a career is learning how to clearly communicate that 1) I will be late/absent (this is NOT a \"courtesy\"; this is a requirement), and 2) I will be eating at the office/picking up something on the way. Or, alternatively \"I love your mom's cooking so much, please set some aside for me for when I get there!\"   YOU are the one with the emergency, not your family.  It is incumbent upon you to feed yourself.  For all the family knows, she's gonna be pulling an all-nighter and ordering a pizza to the office.", "OPs only comment about the job is that it's a \"fancy corporate job\" in an office, and that she's the boss. OP made clear they did not know the actual profession, which seems really odd for someone who's been in their daughter's life for a year and a half.", "First, she gave a specific time frame so it wasn't going to be an all-nighter. Second, she didn't ask for food or even say she expected some. It was OP's daughter that expected OP to set some aside.\n\nIt's clear from OP's post and comments that she does not like this woman, and the lack of food was a purposeful slight. OP is definitely the AH."]}
