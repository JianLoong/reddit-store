When my SIL (32) had her child I offered to watch her child while she got back into work because I understand it\u2019s hard leaving your small baby in a daycare. This was never intended to be long term but a nice gesture from myself as I don\u2019t charge her. However I am now pregnant again with my second child. I am 3 months pregnant and struggling with emotions and morning sickness. I can barely be present for my 2 year old nonetheless watch my child and along with her almost 1 year old. Her child cries a lot due to teething and I\u2019m not sure how to soothe her as she doesn\u2019t nap well and is a generally fussy baby compared to my child. I\u2019m at my wits end and have cried to my fianc\u00e9 multiple times about how emotionally draining it is to watch both. I mentioned to my SIL that they need to find childcare as well as my fianc\u00e9 and he said that my SIL asked to bare with them while they find a place but mentioned she thinks she may have found a place. That was a MONTH ago. So now I\u2019m growing impatient and annoyed as I feel as though I\u2019m struggling mentally and nobody seems to care even though I have made it apparent and how much of a burden it is for me. If that was my child I would\u2019ve found a place within a week or two. However I\u2019m at a loss of how to bring it up again without appearing rude and my fianc\u00e9 says to be patient as he is sure it\u2019s almost done but I argue how he would know that when there seems to be no end date in sight. If I bring it up again AITA? Should I wait another month?

She's the one being rude because you've already told her you they need to find childcare and they still haven't a month later. It's time to be firm and clear, and if they consider that rude, oh well.  \"I know finding childcare is difficult, but it's been a month since I brought it up. This will be my last week watching your daughter. I hope you understand\"", "NTA.\n\nHere's what you say,\n\n\"I don't mean to sound rude, and I love your kid. But I'm pregnant and I can't keep doing this. It's too stressful to watch 2 toddlers, especially when they're fussy. I'll help out for this week, but you need to find someone else.\" \n\nYou've been providing free babysitting for long enough. It's time to prioritize your health and helping your child adjust to all the big changes that are about to happen in your home.", "NTA. Both of these people keep telling you to be patient but neither of them is the one with the problem. They are both telling YOU to be ok with this problem. I mean basically they don't have standing to tell you to be patient. Especially when the baby's parents are not paying you for this. \n\nIt is not good for you or for your baby, for you to be under this sort of stress. I think you should just tell your fiances sister (you don't have the protection of marriage yet so I'm not going to call her your SIL) that, beginning on Monday (yes, this Monday), you will no longer be able to babysit her child and that she will have to make other arrangements. She or her spouse may have to take parental leave but, they are the parents of their baby and it's their job, not yours, to suffer the burden of providing childcare for their baby.\n\nYou're not being paid for this, so there's no contract to break. You're doing your fiance's sister a huge, huge, huge favor, and she's not entitled for that to go on any longer than you are willing to continue doing this huge favor.", "NTA. You are pregnant and need this to be sorted before you become heavily pregnant! SIL needs to sort this out asap. I think you should give her a deadline, choose a date that works for you and put it in writing so she can't say that she didn't know exactly when you needed to be free from giving free childcare. SIL is potentially an AH for not getting things sorted, taking advantage.", "NTA. You have already saved your SIL thousands of dollars by being her daycare. Is she under the impression you will 'get over it' and forget she needed to find alternate care? \n\nBeing straightforward and advocating for what you need is not being rude. Give her a deadline. If you can, punctuate it by going out of town. Visit mom, or a sibling, perhaps? Just be unavailable so she can't weasel out \"just one more week?\"", "NTA. Is your fianc\u00e9 concerned about your health at all???", "Being kind is being honest. Tell both your fianc\u00e9 & SIL exactly what you have said here. You\u2019re overwhelmed. \n\nNTA", "NTA sounds like you've gone above and beyond and she's stalling to get free childcare. You have too look after yourself, your fetus, and your family first.", "NTA.

Tell her to find a place.", "NTA\n\nEasy out-- talk to your doctor and tell him how stressed out you are from watching the child and ask for their opinion on how that stress might affect your baby. Your doctor will likely agree that the stress is too much and unhealthy for you and the baby. Then simply tell your SIL that and say you have to stop and it's non-negotiable-- doctor's orders. \n\nI say all this to make it easier for you to end the situation without getting blamed for being uncaring or indifferent or whatever. The \"blame\" passes to your doctor, which I'm sure your doctor will be glad to back you up on. It's a lot better than just saying \"no,\" as many are suggesting, because these are family members that you will likely have to deal with for a long time. Giving an abrupt \"no\" can cause a lot of bad blood. This will likely get you out of the situation with no bad blood.", "Politeness here is your enemy.  \nPlease write what you want to say, so you're not made to feel guilty and back down when you have the conversation. \n\nYour SIL would have realised at some point that your offer wasn't a set in stone offer to watch her child without any end date. Otherwise you'd be stuck babysitting the child through to adulthood.  Clearly daft. So throw that worry away.\n\nIt was simply a kind offer which you were very generous to actually do for such an extended period.  Many people say things like that and don't even follow through once.\n\nSo please put that aside. She should be extremely grateful for all the free help you have given. She probably won't be,  but remember she should be. \n\nA bunch of flowers, an offer for taking you out for coffee and cake at her expense, that's what, on her side, politeness dictates. This was a massive help for her.\n\nJust explain your health is declining with trying to watch 2 very young children and being pregnant.  So, to ensure her child is properly looked after, you simply can't watch the baby anymore. You don't want to risk something happening to her child. Unfortunately, this is with immediate effect. \n\n You'll be surprised how easily people will sort out an alternative without having to quit their job. She's earning and presumably her partner is, so they can pay for childcare, or her family or friends can help. \n\nHer child is not your problem. You need your husband to protect you and your family,  this sounds like it's severely affected your health. \n\nLook after yourself, your unborn baby and your 2 year old. They come before anyone else's needs.

She would have 2 more weeks and not a day more to figure this out.  After that do not answer the door and don't give into hysterics or threats.  If hubby wants to bail her out then I guess he would have to take off work to watch her child.", "NTA; I will say, where I am, there can be waitlists for months for childcare. So it is possible they found it, but are on a wait list. That said, it\u2019s still not your responsibility to run yourself ragged for them. I\u2019d give them a hard deadline, frankly, and let them figure it out.", "NTA just say what you said here - you're pregnant and struggling - you can't do it anymore. Give her 2 weeks to find childcare and then you're done. And stop going through your fiance - talk to her yourself", "Well, what you could start doing is being too sick to be available, the day before call and say I'm too sick, I'm  too nauseous today to watch her, start making it a inconvenience to her, because at this point, your a perfect solution.

Stop thinking or expecting your SO to handle this.  This is your situation and you should deal directly with your SIL in this matter.  Be firm and plan on being gone the day after your end date so if she tries to guilt you by showing up, you won\u2019t be home and won\u2019t have to go through not answering the door.

And it's the sensible not burning ridges option to politely enquire first rather than going straight to rude just because your partner is making you stew in the back ground without talking to your SIL until you explode with frustration. It sounds like he's not even passing along your messages, and is more comfortable sacrificing your comfort to not even slightly upset them.\n\nIf *she* then pushes back and sounds like she's doing nothing, or even if she can't find anything long term and needs to find another short term alternative, sure, go ultimatum, give them a week or two notice, tell them you simply can't anymore due to your health.

When my SIL (32) had her child I offered to watch her child while she got back into work because I understand it\u2019s hard leaving your small baby in a daycare. This was never intended to be long term but a nice gesture from myself as I don\u2019t charge her. However I am now pregnant again with my second child. I am 3 months pregnant and struggling with emotions and morning sickness. I can barely be present for my 2 year old nonetheless watch my child and along with her almost 1 year old. Her child cries a lot due to teething and I\u2019m not sure how to soothe her as she doesn\u2019t nap well and is a generally fussy baby compared to my child. I\u2019m at my wits end and have cried to my fianc\u00e9 multiple times about how emotionally draining it is to watch both. I mentioned to my SIL that they need to find childcare as well as my fianc\u00e9 and he said that my SIL asked to bare with them while they find a place but mentioned she thinks she may have found a place. That was a MONTH ago. So now I\u2019m growing impatient and annoyed as I feel as though I\u2019m struggling mentally and nobody seems to care even though I have made it apparent and how much of a burden it is for me. If that was my child I would\u2019ve found a place within a week or two. However I\u2019m at a loss of how to bring it up again without appearing rude and my fianc\u00e9 says to be patient as he is sure it\u2019s almost done but I argue how he would know that when there seems to be no end date in sight. If I bring it up again AITA? Should I wait another month? Help.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Previously there was no time limit, so doing this would light a fire under SIL to actually do something this time. Then, once the 2 weeks are done, have something scheduled for day 15 that makes her unavailable to babysit. \"I gave you 2 weeks, now I have an appointment I need to get to.

Being honest and open about your needs is the way to go. She's pregnant,  has a child and has terrible morning sickness.  She's done. No need to placate people. The only people you have to come up with reasons you can't do something for are toxic narcissistic people.", "Did she give them that date or was it relayed by the fiance?  Time for the message to come straight from the horses mouth.", "NTA but you and the SIL need to communicate, and not through your fiance. It is possible she is on a waiting list, but you wont know that unless you talk to her. It is not rude to bring it up, but what you are doing by NOT bringing it up is building more and more resentment until eventually you will snap and damage your relationship with your family memeber. My cousins both have babies around the same age and finding childcare for them was incredibly difficult and it took a couple months, so maybe she really is doing everything she can. \n\nHonestly all of this should have been talked about from the start, you can\u2019t expect other people to think of your needs on your behalf, they are likely busy trying to juggle their own stressors.", "Daycare in my area cost me $1500 a week when my son was small. You have saved them so much money and time it\u2019s crazy. It does take time to get enrolled into daycare but honestly especially this time of year they\u2019re probably just trying to not pay for care so they can afford end of year expenses.

I\u2019ve always heard (this extends way beyond child care, so maybe that\u2019s not the case on that issue) that Germany is way better with these types of issues. I\u2019m in the US and my child had state sponsored pre-school at 3. I don\u2019t know the system in Germany, but daycare is pretty widely obtainable in the US (even if it is a financial burden). I personally know multiple people who run daycare services out of their home and generally speaking would be happy to take on more clients. Does Germany have strict regulations on child-care? Are you referring to affordable/state-sponsored childcare (I do know a lot of times in the US it\u2019s more money to pay for childcare than the money a parent can make)?", "2 weeks.

They r being hell selfish.", "She's been there done that.", "I disagree with 2 weeks. Yes, they probably have not been looking for childcare, but that's not OPs fault. OP made it clear the arrangement was over, if SIL didn't look for childcare that's on her. She has to deal with the consequences. OP shouldn't bend over backwards to accommodate SIL's expectation that OP would be a pushover.", "she gave them \\`the two weeks\\` a MONTH ago", "I will be more extreme and just text the sister at night  that I just cant look for her baby anymore if she didn't read the message the next time she comes to my home to drop off the baby I will be conveniently in an outting with my child and let her figure It out what to do for now on to get my message clear, she had a month to look for a sitter or a daycare it was plenty of time already.", "No, she doesn't 'need' to give two weeks. This is not a paid gig or even a real job, and enough is enough. Those people were warned.", "I never heard of a two week notice for childcare. Daycares can kick a child out with no notice. Anyway, she already gave her a one month notice.", "I\u2019m doing doubt it. Daycare can have wait lists that are months or years long. She legitimately may be on waitlists at all the local daycares. I get the OP is done, but finding childcare in 2 weeks is unrealistic.", "Too bad. It's not the OP's fault her fiance's sister hasn't made other arrangements in the 18 months since she got pregnant. She can hire a temporary babysitter immediately. Or call the grandparents.", "Right!? Even a nanny service around here takes a good month to place staff, daycare is up to six months. I think at this point, having a sit-down conversation is in order, with a specific exit strategy. Since they are both families with toddlers,  I would avoid the advice of others saying basically cut them off in 1 week. Op shouldn't burn a bridge that she may need to cross one day.", "Yeah finding childcare is super hard. Where i live most have waiting lists 3-6 months out. Completely crazy.\n\nBut OP needs to protect herself and the parents of the baby need to step up.", "End of week AND SIL pays everyday til then", "THIS. I was going to say feign an illness, but this is much better. Start by saying that you\u2019ve been feeling really rundown lately and you\u2019re planning to see your doctor, and that you think it\u2019s best she find alternative childcare in case it\u2019s a bug. You can  then tell her that your doctor advised you to reduce your stress and activity and that you think that separating yourself from their childcare would be best for your physical and emotional health. \n\nYou can definitely say something that will appease them, like: \u201cI wish my doctor\u2019s advice was different, I hate to leave you searching for childcare\u201d. That way it makes it seem like it\u2019s out of your control. If they push for you to continue, even for one or two days, you can say: \u201cAgain, I really wish that I could but I really need to follow my doctor\u2019s advice.\u201d \n\nIf she ever brings up you being her childcare again, you can honestly say that while you don\u2019t mind doing so on occasion, you have felt much better since the change and that you\u2019re glad her child is getting more attention than you could provide. That last bit might be a lie, but it\u2019s one that she\u2019d probably appreciate.", "Yaaas!! I came here to say this! She is NTA but every other adult in this scenario is. SIL should offer to watch OPs child for the next few weeks until she is feeling better!!", "Yes, stress is often an invisible illness that so many people dismiss. But OP is quickly getting more pregnant, she can\u2019t wait anyone for SIL to find other care on her timeline. If they don\u2019t believe you\u2019re stressed then show them and tell them they will have to utilize their back up childcare (one they should have set up in case OP had a contagious illness and couldn\u2019t watch kiddo) until they find another long term childcare option. Set a firm date within the next week and tell them that\u2019s it, you\u2019re pregnant enough you don\u2019t need to add more weeks along to your already stressed mind. \n\nNTA", "It's irrelevant and 100% not OP's problem. Her fiance's sister KNEW she was having a baby, why was she not setting this up then, before OP made the short term deal anyway. Who expects to get free childcare indefinitely? That's bogus as fuck.", "While obtainable daycare may be a thing where you are, that is not the reality for all of the US. It was where I\u2019m from. It most definitely is not where I am now. Actual daycares are full and have waiting lists of a year or more. I called every single one I could find in 45 minutes to an hour of me. Some had waiting lists so long they weren\u2019t even taking names and numbers to add to the list. \n\nAnd in home daycares? Massive joke, at least around here. The few decent ones are also full. And the rest are nothing approaching reliable, if you even want your kid to be there to begin with. We went through several of these before giving up. \n\nSince then my husband and I have had to either have one of us working and the other stay home, or work opposite shifts so we don\u2019t need childcare.", "Only the OP knows the dynamics of this mess.

I can\u2019t look after Junior for the rest of my pregnancy at least.\u201d If other family take issue with it then they can step up and help. Op has done enough. If it was my wife after the first crying spree I would have been on the phone saying \u201cWe\u2019re done you all need to work something out\u201d", "It sounds like the OP is genuinely sick anyway, she doesn't need to fake it. She's being ignored probably because the SIL hopes once the morning sickness passes, she'll carry on being mugged off by them.", "He\u2019s her fianc\u00e9, not her husband yet.

Rinse and repeat till they get the picture.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be bed rest as such. It can be \u2018rest as much as possible or OP\u2019s health and pregnancy may be negatively affected\u2019.", "This makes me so sad. I literally went through something so similar. My husband said either you tell your sister this is your last week watching the baby or I will. He wanted me to stop right when he saw i was stressed and so sick & tired i could barely function.", "Totally agree. She\u2019s not even getting paid! She\u2019s doing it as a favour, not as a job. \n\nHonestly she can just say she\u2019s sick and no longer available and be done with it. I\u2019m a people pleaser too so probably wouldn\u2019t do that, but OP does not owe SIL childcare and is being hugely taken advantage of and that makes me sad.", "If OP was hospitalized with a life-threatening situation, what would SIL/BIL do then? OP being their babysitter is no longer an option. SIL/BIL can take time off of work, hire a nanny, etc\u2026there are other options besides daycare.", "That doesn\u2019t make it OP\u2019s problem.

No.  Which tells us she has no intention of moving to daycare.", "How is that OPs problem? She doesn\u2019t need to give them any time, they can take it off work, it\u2019s their child\u2026 I bet when it\u2019s them being inconvenienced, they will soon find alternative childcare", "Yes, and that includes her partner - he's not the one who's pregnant and looking after two small kids, so he doesn't get a say", "This.  Yes.  Just tell the parents that they have until specific date to find child care, after which date OP will charge $50 per day.  Write it up, make them sign it.  Film it on your phones.  I guarantee they will at least find an at-home sitter for less than that while they look for daycare facilities.", "NTA\n\nPeople like this will def take advantage as long as possible.

Unfortunately, while you can quit a job and never see them again, it\u2019s not quite that easy with family.", "They've had since when child was born (before that, if they are US, where there are waiting lists) to find childcare. They've disregarded it, as they took advantage of a people pleaser. This OP isn't being unreasonable if she stops tomorrow.", "Oh well, in that case I guess SIL will have to spend some of the thousands of dollars she saved on childcare thanks to OP by hiring a short-term nanny from one of the services. She can have a licensed, bonded nanny within 72 hours. Then she can continue the search for daycare without harming OP.", "Then she needs to find a babysitter. Simple. I am a sitter becuz of the childcare issues. Every problem can be solved if ppl try. SIL doesn\u2019t want to pay", ".. and when they do find the place, perhaps they can take the two-year old one day a week. Sounds like you could do with some time off.\n\nNTA", "This is true. We only have one decent daycare in our area. And by decent, I mean it's the only one that hasn't almost been shut down for child abuse. The others... are sketchy, and honestly, I'd judge people I know for sending their kids there. There are daily complaints from those places, with pictures, of kids coming home covered in bruises or handprints, and somehow they're still open. I worked in a Christian based one for about a month and couldn't stomach it. I adored the kids, but they had very abusive practices, and for time out, they would hold the kids down, and they would shake them if they wouldn't be quiet, or they'd spank them. We had a poor little nonverbal autistic kiddo who was absolutely precious, but he hated naptime, so they would hold him down until he wore himself out trying to get free and passed out. Like this kid was about to turn four, he's allowed to decide he doesn't want a nap just like the other four year olds. Needless to say... they got reported on a Friday, and I just never showed back up on the following Monday. They legit did not give a shit about those kids, just the money they made on them. And they still had like a two month wait list as bad as they were. And that was only one of the 4 near me. Only one of them is decent. The other two are even worse than the one I worked at.", "Except the SIL has had almost a year to find a good daycare. Not just a month. Her kid is almost 1yo now.", "I like your response. It was very fair.", "NOT. HER. PROBLEM!", "I dont disagree that it is becoming the cousin's problem and realistically one of them will have to take a leave of absence or quit to care for thwir kid for a while. However the comments claiming 2 weeks being more than enough to get their kid into daycare are out to lunch.", "Do we know she hasn't signed up for lists?  All OP said was she found something she liked but found it a month ago.", "Just tell them that tomorrow you aren't available and leave . . . they'll have to figure it out.", "This is the thing. When OP offered, SIL should have taken it as an opportunity to go on the waiting list for a place she really wants. \n\nBecause she hasn\u2019t done that, she has to make do with whatever place will take them.", "So they\u2019re all working PT before and after school?", "My son went to a church daycare when he was about 2. He\u2019d start crying as soon as we got to the car. I asked the workers, and found out they didn\u2019t give the kids a drink after outside play. He was dying of thirst. I stopped taking him there.", "Private in-home care is cost prohibitive for most people. It's crazy expensive", "Are you talking day care or hiring a nanny?", "Except their child is almost 1yrs. So they've had a year to get into a daycare. OP said at the beginning it was temporary so SIL should've been on the lists already", "But she asked them a month ago. So realistically they would have had 6 weeks given two weeks notice. What if OP had a miscarriage due to all the stress. Her pregnancy should be a priority not the feelings of her inlaws", "I feel like she should have started looking once she was settled in at work. So months ago.", "OP states it was only supposed to be for a limited time. During that time, parents should have been lining up child care.", "I don\u2019t get this take at all. SIL is not owed childcare and when she was first considering going back to work she should\u2019ve been putting her child on waiting lists. OP has been very generous and saved her money and stress during this time. Her being unable to continue (due to health reasons no less) shouldn\u2019t make her the bad guy. I\u2019m sad for her if family paint her as a villain because if anyone is it\u2019s the SIL.", "Why make a plan to be gone when you\u2019re suffering morning sickness, anxiety and have a 2 yr old to deal with? Just don\u2019t open the door when she shows up.", "Yeah, like if any of the people I know said they took their kids to any of those daycares near us, I would judge them, at least somewhat. They're not safe. One poor girl picked her infant up, and the baby had a red HANDPRINT across her face. When they went back to look at footage, the baby was crying, so the worker smacked her. She posted the video on their review page. These daycares are not safe in the slightest. One of the workers went to jail for literally shaking a baby until it died. It's bad here.", "Did OP tell her cousin that though? Because the sentence \"I told her I could watch her kid while she got back into work because I know how hard it is leaving a baby in daycare\" to me doesn't set an end date. She did add on that she didn't think it would be long term, but was the timeline discussed at any point before she told the cousin to find somewhere else?", "Your math doesn't make sense. There is not 6 weeks in 1 month. She told them 1 month ago they needed to find other options. \n\nThat's a shitty thing to put into the universe saying that OP is going to miscarry from the stress. If that was the case, she should also get her own kid into childcare and go on bedrest, because she has other conditions clearly on the go in that situation.", "But did OP state that to her cousin? Or did she word it like the sentence before where said she would take care of the kid because she knows how hard it is putting a baby in daycare? OP isn't answering anyone's comments so it's kind of hard to make any assumption on that. If she did tell them it was short term, did she give them a time frame? Because if it was just whilst the kid was a baby, it kind of still is a baby. She's mad that a month ago she said \"hey find somewhere else\" and they haven't managed to yet. To me that doesn't sound like she was only watching the kid as a bridge while they found childcare.", "Hmmm...maybe not. OP seems kind but not a great communicator. If OP didn't then this sucks for everyone", "Yes it\u2019s literally stated in the OP statement. They knew it was temporary SIL is just being an AH at this time. Not communicating anything after OP told them a month ago about her emotions and her current situation and she is just quiet. OP NTAH", "it's not her cousin.  It's her fianc\u00e9's sister!  Who is 32 freaking years old and should be more than capable to take care of her own problems.  OP is already dealing with enough drama.  Parenthood 101."]}
