There are 9 of us going, and most of them are terrible at responding to any attempts for pre-planning. \n\nIn our vacation group chat my boyfriend (25M) asked if anyone would want to rent a car instead of ubering everywhere to save money. All he asked in return was that whoever joins be willing to share driving responsibilities, which split amongst 4-5 people seemed reasonable to me. All but one of us have licenses but some of us are more comfortable driving than others. Half our friends responded and said they\u2019d join.\n\nThe other half was silent on the topic so we went ahead and rented a car for just those who replied & the one friend who doesn\u2019t have a license, because we had an extra space in the car and honestly he was hanging out with us at the right time when we brought it up. \n\nAfter we got the car, one of our friends got mad at us and called us selfish for renting a car and \u201ctaking all the drivers\u201d with us. He said since everyone didn\u2019t reply he didn\u2019t think we were going to go through with it, and it wasn\u2019t fair that we didn\u2019t think about the group first.  \n\nHe told us that we should have split those willing to drive into two cars to account for our friends who don\u2019t want to drive. We argued back to him that part of the benefits of renting a car is that driving is split amongst 4 people instead of 2, and that many of us wouldn\u2019t want to drive 50% of the time instead of 25% just to accommodate them. We pointed out that everyone else COULD drive but doesn\u2019t want to, and we took the one who doesn\u2019t have a license with us. We tried communicating that we are all uncomfortable with driving in a new state & being responsible for each other\u2019s lives, but we do it anyways for convenience. He said it\u2019s not fair that they will have to pay more for Ubers now that there is less people to join in one Uber ride. \n\nI also want to add, we decided it\u2019s only fair that if they didn\u2019t pay for the car, that they aren\u2019t allowed to ride in it either. There are times (especially with 9 people) that not everyone wants to go somewhere. But if there\u2019s an empty spot in the car we told our other friends that it won\u2019t be open to take. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s fair that since we planned ahead & paid for it we should have to let the others get a free ride. \n\nAITA for not splitting into 2 rental cars & not allowing the others to ride even if there\u2019s an empty spot?", "created_utc": 1682846524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133kj63/aita_for_renting_a_car_with_only_half_my_friends/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also am refusing to allow those who did not originally pay for the car to ride in it at all, even if there is a free spot. \n\n2) I might be the asshole here as I didn\u2019t consider my other friends who didn\u2019t respond to renting a car who ended up wanting to be in one.

Mostly due to also having organised group things and my experience is  the people who don't participate in planning are always the ones who then have an issue with what's planned. \n\nLike maybe just reply to the chats and we could organise something that worked for everyone!", "NTA. Although the last part is a bit. If there is a free space and all of you are going by car except one, the one person should be allowed to go by car too. Maybe then pay a little bit for gas or something? I just don't like the idea of them being the only one in an uber.

You should've just directly messaged those who you knew would respond immediately instead of addressing the entire group. And of they're always that bad at responding, then maybe it's best to stop inviting them to events, vacations, outings, etc. It's very rude and inconsiderate of them.", "This trip is going to be a mess if people think they can muscle in on things other people paid for! Godspeed OP", "NTA and for those saying you didn't think of the group, you did by putting the offer out there for the car rental in the first place. Classic case of projection by those who didn't think ahead.", "NTA - people who can't even be bothered to reply shouldn't expect to be included in the rental car plans.", "Mostly NTA.  You guys asked the group, the group members who were interested replied and you guys rented the car.  The only thing I could fault you for was not communicating to the group as a whole that you guys were moving forward with the plan, which would have been the nice thing to do.  \n\nStill your friend who brought up the issue is the AH here, he's expecting you guys to chauffer them around the entire trip and not contribute to the driving at all, yeah, even if your friend wanted to go in on your plan I would have been a hard no if they weren't willing to share in the responsibility to drive.", "NTA\n\nSo the trip hasn't happened yet and the people who didn't join the rental car group could still form a group? \n\nSo even with time left to rent another car, they still don't want to drive?\n\nSounds like someone wants to go on vacation like they are still a child. I travelled with children, which is great, but also more nerve-racking as the adult has to take on all the adult stressful parts. \n\nBeing a driver means that you can't drink on an outing or enjoy the scenery while traveling or passively ignore traffic. It's more stressful and less of a vacation. \n\nIf you were so inclined, you and the other drivers could consider charging the non-drivers for the entire cost of the rentals and then dividing driving duties for the two cars amongst those that do drive. With the caveat that the drivers still choose where they want to go, as in if none of the drivers want to go on a specific outing, it would be up to the non-drivers to figure out transportation for themselves. \n\nGroup travel is tough. People either have to be easy going with the group or comfortable going their own way. Problems arise when one member of the group tries to dictate the activities of the others. \n\nEnjoy your trip!", "ESH. Inefficient planning.", "ESH, a bunch of drama is all I m reading. solution:\n- they did not reply, but now they do and are saying they do want a car. so it is their responsibility to rent a second car or at least to gather the money.\n- if they do so, you should agree to rearrange drivers so that the confirmed drivers are split over the 2 cars.\nthe end.", "ESH\n\nThey didn\u2019t respond and are now complaining they weren\u2019t included.\n\nOnce you had a full car it should have been clearly communicated to the group that those who had responded were proceeding with renting the car.\n\nI can understand their frustration at watching their licence-free friend be included while they\u2019re excluded when the original condition was that you had to be willing to drive.\n\nDenying non-renting friends an occasional seat in a car where there\u2019s an empty spot seems extreme.\n\nBasically, bad communication and a dose of hypocrisy all round.", "BF is the AH. You had a plan-agreed by the whole group. Your BF proposes a change, which is NOT agreed by the whole group, and proceeds not only to split the group, but also destroys the original agreed-upon plan so that it doesn\u2019t work for the remainder of the group. \n\nThis is a group trip you\u2019re planning, but somehow you (collectively) don\u2019t care to make sure everyone has input to keep it that way. What you and BF are doing is basically horrible planning.", "NAH, yet \nDid the progress of the car plan, who was in and how it would work, get reported in the full group chat? I'm looking for where the non-participants were notified about the plans for renting the car, cost per person, as those discussions and decisions were made. Were the non-participants given the opportunity to participate in the evolution of the car plan- such as non-driver's paying an equal share for renting car(s) and being included in car trips? If so,  NAH.\n\nWere the non-participants excluded from planning beyond that first mention of renting the car? If so, and the car plan was developed by those who did respond in a separate space from the whole group planning chat, that could be an a-hole move. Yeah, it streamlines the rent a car plan. It also creates a segregation within the group between the break away rent a car group and the non-responders who weren't kept in the loop as plans were made that have a big impact on the shared trip. \nPeople who don't want the expense and responsibility of renting a car make plans for transportation. What public and private transportation services are accessible at the destination? Were the non-responders planning on public transportation? \n\nMost importantly, were those not included in the car rental plan informed about the plans being made, or cut off? You are inclined to make the divide within the group more complete by refusing access to the car by anyone not on your rental list, even when there's space for a trip already happening. Why? Creating a group within the group, excluding the rest, is an AH move. If that's what happened, you're an AH.", "YTA don\u2019t plan a trip for multiple people and then choose not to accommodate half the group. Using Ubers was the original plan the whole group agreed to then your boyfriend decided he wanted to change things and never actually confirmed with the whole group that was okay.
