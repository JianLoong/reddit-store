It's a gym. Incline is a basic feature of a treadmill.

The worst case is that they terminate your membership, which it sounds like would leave you better off anyway.", "INFO\n\n> forget to 'turn it down' while switching off the treadmill and it causes the treadmill to break down\n\nWhy the hell would that **break** a treadmill?", "NTA, but it's also perfectly within their rights to be the asshole in this instance. \n\nThey are telling you not to use a basic standard feature of the treadmill. Most serious runners are told at some point that they should put at least a tiny incline on the treadmill to replicate the effects of wind resistance. And there very well may be a marginal bit of extra wear and tear on the machine. But it's a commercial machine presumably, and it's designed to be used in that way, so they are almost certainly blowing the issue out of proportion. \n\nMy answer would be to tell them that you are going to continue to use the machine as it was designed, while trying to be cognizant of their concerns and return the incline to zero. At that point they can cancel your membership if they want at any time, and they should feel free to do so. But a trainer 'telling me off' is a no go. They get the grey rock response from me and maybe an 'are you done?' if I even feel like responding. They are a trainer, not the gym cop, and you did nothing unreasonable. \n\nI'm assuming this isn't a college gym or something, but I wouldn't patronize a gym that treated me like that. If there's no other alternative in the area, well, then you are going to have to make a call and decide if you want to swallow your annoyance. But I'm not dealing with that level of controlling behavior in a business, and a review mentioning their handling of the issue is probably going to be helpful to other people wanting to deal with a reasonably managed gym.\n\nedit: in another comment he mentions the nonrefundable nature of his membership, that kind of implies that they have run into other folks who had their reasonable expectations over ridden for stupid reasons. I'd get what use I could out of the place and absolutely spread some negative reviews around, because people should really know what they are getting into with this place. It's completely unreasonable behavior from their management.\n\ndouble edit: I wrote this assuming OP was running. I have since looked up the workout they mentioned, and it is *walking* on an incline for 30 minutes. There is no reasonable gym that would would deny this, nor is a machine designed to stand up to people *running* on it on an incline for *years* of service going to fail prematurely because of this use case.

I think you\u2019d be surprised by how slow civvies are though, I\u2019d wager not many people in commercials are running those paces. \n\nAnd yeah, the 12-3-30 stuff is utter bollocks IMO. Just a trend to avoid proper training. \n\nAnd yes, I agree with you mate.", "That's not quite how contract law works. The client here contracted the services of the gym under certain assumptions. What if the gym suddenly removes all cable machines? Or any weight over 25lbs? Or shortens their opening hours from noon to 3pm and only on Thursdays?\n\nYes, the gym can do whatever they want, but in any of the above situations, and client that paid any membership, upfront or whatever else, is entitled to a refund of the unused portion.", "Lmao it's a function built into the machine.\n\nThis is ridiculous and unenforceable.", "You\u2019re flummoxed because people probably usually use \u201clol\u201d to laugh at you, and you don\u2019t find yourself funny the way others do..so no \u201clol\u201d for you but plenty for others when reading your thoughts", "Lol =\n- awkward chuckle after saying something embarrassing or dumb\n- that awkward laugh/smile someone does after they say something potentially too serious or critical\n- mean girls style laugh/chuckle that\u2019s making fun of you\n- utterly deadpan ha ha, usually with people who have a dry sense of humor", "I'd have a hard time believing they put \"entitled to inverted function on treadmill \"  and exclude the always present \"we maintain the right to manage our equipment as seen fit\"  on a contract.", "I assume OP is paying for the gym though and not for the apples? How is it thee same thing?", "Awful comparison", "But aren't we paying to use their equipment. The membership was quite expensive as well", "And your bottom line is ridiculous by telling him to lose out on money already paid.\n\nEdit: since they blocked me for disagreeing \n\nAnd you reply comment says lose out on the money. That\u2019s clearly your opinion on it.", "Have you ever once actually used a treadmill? You absolutely will not cause commercial gym equipment to fail by using a standard feature for its intended purpose.\n\nAnd if you look up the 12:3:30 workout OP mentions (which I had to) it's not even *running*. It's walking on an incline. They are designed to take vastly more abuse than someone walking on an incline. \n\nThe whole issue is dumb.", "So try and stop me.", "Have you read the user agreement? I\u2019m certain it\u2019s a no.", "> Because they typically aren't in the user's favor.\n\nAnd that's why contracts of adhesion are ruled illegal constantly. They regularly contain illegal provisions that don't comply with the national and local laws governing contracts.", "They can\u2019t have people with gym memberships and then say \u201coh but now you can\u2019t do this\u201d they\u2019d need to issue new membership contracts for that little tid bit and they didn\u2019t. So the OP can use whatever however", "I don't care.\n\nIt's a treadmill. It's a dumb rule.\n\nThey can make the user agreement say whatever they want. This is not an enforceable rule short of revoking my membership and if they do that I'm getting my money back one way or another.\n\nDo you all tiptoe around your lives blindly following every rule you come across for no reason other than fear of reprisal? Because I assure you you can pretty much ignore the dumb ones without consequences. Nobody is going to enforce most of that shit.", "In your brain did you think this was a good analogy as you were typing it or are you just compelled to participate because you have nothing else going on for you?\n\nIn what way is my house like a public gym? In what way is using a built in function of a treadmill akin to \"doing whatever you want with it?\"\n\nWhy did you make me waste my time responding to you with this crap?", "With 12-3-30 being bollocks, isn't any cardio basically fine so long as it gets your heart rate up and you do it with consistency? The idea isn't to become an athlete with it, it's to find a consistent way of exercising. \n\nI both run and do 13-3-30 (actually more like 16-5-30 now) and feel like the latter works very different muscles to running and gets my heart rate up equally as well. I'm tired at the end of the 30 mins whether I've ran it or walked it at an incline, and the 13-3-30 makes me way more sore to boot.", "I'm old and obese and broken and I still pass civvies out on the trail all the time. Sometimes I do local races just to demoralize all the skinny people in expensive clothes I pass. Sometimes I stick my gut out. Or whistle. It's fun.\n\nI do think the 12-3-30 thing doesn't look like a bad thing, even if it's trendy. Just think of it as a ruckmarch with the incline substituting for the weight on your back. And 30 minutes is right around where it should be for getting a solid base, while the walking is a little easier than jogging on people who haven't built any strength in their connective tissue yet.", "I concede, it is not the same thing. My comparison was not the best. Still, the equipment is still the gym's property, and they can still decide the rules on using them. If OP disagrees, she can stop being a paying customer and look for another gym. Paying entitles the customer to use the equipment following the guideline in place as explained by management. It doesn't entitle customers to use the equipment however they see fit. Now, if she has paid the membership with the intention of using the incline, she would have grounds to ask for a refund, imo. But she would still have to comply with the rules regardless, as in: follow the rules or take your business elsewhere.", "Switch gyms already. It is no use arguing with people commenting since they don't run the gym.", "> But aren't we paying to use their equipment\n\nYou're paying to use the equipment they say you can use, in the manner they say you can use it.", "You are and they have every right to ban you for not following their rules.", "No, you aren\u2019t paying to use their equipment as you see fit. You are paying to use their equipment in whatever manner they tell you is permissible.", "No, my bottom line is to obey the rules of the place. That was pretty clear from the previous comments.", "Lol. You.", "Which is why in several comments I've maintained that we can't make any factual statements about it.  I have said though that most contracts are designed to protect the company and not the user which is a truthful statement.   Just pointing out the inconsistent logic being used like redditors opinions will overpower a signed agreement.", "That could be the case. Key word is COULD.  It just feels weird to make such swift judgement without any of the detial and in my own personal opinion you better make damn sure you understand what you agree to before you do.", "They can if you sign an agreement saying they can do that.  \n\nYall are reaching so hard to only grab straws.  As I said we  can't make any factual claims without reading said contract.  And it's niave to think a company won't protect themselves.\n\nUnless yall are get the info from op about said contract, youre only making baseless assumptions of \" well I payed so I want it\" which isn't how contracts work.", "That's great, so you've admitted that your argument isn't based in logic but your emotions and opinion.  Well that's not really how contracts work, although it would be entertaining to see that argument in court.  \n\nYour honor I think the rule is dumb and shouldn't apply to me even though I agreed", "Exactly, I'm sure they have other rules (wear shoes, don't drop weights on the floor, etc etc). Members who don't like these rules can set up their own gym at home.", "An unenforceable rule is a nonexistent rule. So again, try to stop me.", "No, I disagree from the beginning. You're assuming the contract protects the gym. I'm rejecting that assumption because whether or not the language of the contract protects the gym (and I very much doubt that it does), that language is irrelevant.\n\nBusinesses, as a matter of morality (which this sub is about) shouldn't be able to abuse their bargaining power and scam people out of money. OP signed that contract with the reasonable belief he would have access to reasonable use of their equipment. For the gym to change that agreement part way through the contract is unethical, whether or not they have the legal power to do so (and I don't concede that a judge in a contract dispute would agree with the gym).\n\nEdit: typo fixing", "Who cares what the contract says? This isn\u2019t a legal sub. If you only derive your morality from the law, then you\u2019re an idiot.", "This sounds like a single gym decision to not use the incline feature, which wouldn\u2019t fall under the agreement/contract that OP signed with the actual gym. So the gym needs to issue a new member agreement that includes \u201cno usey incliney\u201d or they dont. But until they do that, it\u2019s not an actual rule. It\u2019s just management being lazy about checking their machines.", "My argument is based on what AITA is based on: the moral rules that govern societal interactions.\n\nLiterally nobody gives a shit about what would hold up in court here. And you're a fool if you think this would ever escalate to court in some way.\n\nStop relying on systems to insulate you from real life.", "Are you a lawyer?", "These rules are for safety right. It's basic gym etiquette and is universal", "ROTFL you.", "I think that if you agree to something you didn't want too, it's your fault for being careless.  That's just me one person's opinion. \n\n If the contract is clear and open and you don't read before signing than I have little sympathy.\n\nYou say the gym changes agreements when my argument from the start was I believe theyd have a clause in the contract from the beginning. And then went on repeatedly sayings its hard to know without reading it.", "That part", "More like I think if you agree to something, the only person you can blame is your own stupidity if you don't actually agree with it.  The contracts aren't secret you know?  It just feel pretty lazy.", "Maybe, that is a more viable reality.  I have less issue with that take than \"the rule is dumb and shouldn't count because I know better\"", "Sorry I forgot when you agree to something you can back out if you don't like it guilt free.   Got it.\n\nImo don't agree to something you'll eventually go back on.", "Are any of us?  We're all just people saying our opinions.  So if im not a lawyer and you're not one either, why would me not being one discredit my argument but not yours?", "The treadmill rules are for safety too", "Imagine being so afraid of a manager at a gym you're paying to use that you blindly follow this rule lmao.", "So if someone falls for a scam, it's their fault? After all, they \"agreed to something,\" right?", "It\u2019s not \u201cthis rule is dumb blah blah\u201d it\u2019s \u201cthis rule doesn\u2019t have any place in the contract I signed and other peoples irresponsibility is the issue of the gym employees, not me..who is paying to use equipment at their full function\u201d. Not that weird or hard to understand. It\u2019s a gym issue and the gym should do better. Doing better doesn\u2019t mean restricting or rescinding the ability to use a basic function of a treadmill.", "[deleted]", "Did they read the contract in your hypothetical?  Or is it just any old scam now because that wouldn't be very comparable to our conversation.", "Someone's getting pouty.  Its just a reddit sub lighten up."]}
