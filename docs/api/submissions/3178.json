We were friends. one day she was on the phone w her husband, they were fighting. He was with us. He had her on speaker. She started saying mean things about me & my fianc\u00e9 & our parenting for no reason,such random things? Said we let our son \u201clive\u201d w someone else (my other sil) bc he went over there to play 2 days in a row. Anyway, I tried talking to her about her comments and asked if I did something to make her angry at me. She said I am sensitive & need to get over myself. She made comments about our loss of a pregnancy/struggle to conceive. She said we needed to \u201cstop worrying about babies & focus on being parents.\u201d  I am unsure why she was saying these things. \n\nShe continued to be awful behind my back to my fianc\u00e9 when he would state that we are not hanging around her anymore bc of her behavior. I\u2019m pregnant & she is mad bc she was not allowed at the gender reveal. She tried to \u201capologize\u201d to me a few weeks before the reveal so she could come but apologized by saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry u were offended. I am sorry that you misconstrued what I said/took it out of context.\u201d & asking that we meet in person. I told her these were not apologies. I reminded her of what she said, why it was so hurtful. She didn\u2019t respond. I said she is not invited. At other family events she has been gossiping about me & I didn\u2019t want this at my parents home on an exciting day for me. After all, she said I shouldn\u2019t be having anymore kids. \n\nToday is the 1st thanksgiving w/o my fianc\u00e9s grandparents - they both passed this year. 5 minutes of being there, as I am talking to other family members, she walks by & says hello to my son, looks up at me as I am mid sentence, says \u201cEw\u201d and walks away. SIL is in her 30s & is being so juvenile. I told my fianc\u00e9 what happened. He said to ignore it. I said no, I wanted him to stay here with his family of course but I was going to leave. I don\u2019t want to be stressed while pregnant &I am uncomfortable. I go outside\n\nHim & MIL come out there saying not to ruin thanksgiving by leaving, that I shouldn\u2019t let it bother me and blah blah blah. I say I am uncomfortable with how she\u2019s treating me & I want to remove myself from the situation. MIL says \u201cwell I was very upset about her being excluded from the gender reveal & so was she.\u201d I state that\u2019s her own doing, this exact behavior is why she was. They said we should just be able to be cordial at events and I agreed & reminded them that I was doing absolutely nothing today when she started problems. \n\nI had my aunt come get me. His response is making me rethink being a part of this family. It seems they cater to her behavior, say it\u2019s just how she is. My MIL told me we just need to talk, asked what it\u2019ll take for me to allow SIL back into my life(my unborn child\u2019s life). In short i told her SIL does not see the fault in her actions & only \u201capologized\u201d bc she wanted to be at the reveal, there\u2019s no true remorse.. to me, nothing she can do.& I left. AITA for leaving?\n\nedit to add: both my fianc\u00e9 and MIL kept repeating i need to talk to SIL in person and at this point I don\u2019t want to. Her behavior and lack of remorse is narcissistic and my fianc\u00e9s other sister has stayed it\u2019s senseless trying to talk to her because of how she is. Friends have told me this and her family has too. I don\u2019t have a desire to talk in person to her anymore. We are past that \n my MIL is usually the sweetest person I know and tries desperately to make everyone happy. She apologized for her daughters behavior but reiterated that she can\u2019t control her. Nobody wants drama with the SIL so they just let her do what she wants and I told my MIL that\u2019s fine and that\u2019s why i\u2019m removing myself from a situation where I was made uncomfortable. Confronting her daughter would\u2019ve caused a scene and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t do it but at the same time, I should\u2019ve been allowed to leave without the guilt tripping. My MIL was on the verge of tears as she really seemed to want me there and said repeatedly that I am her daughter too. It\u2019s her first Thanksgiving without her parents. Additionally she\u2019s been a victim to her daughters bullying longer than any of us. she is not confrontational and I don\u2019t see her standing up to SIL. I\u2019ve seen and heard of SIL making her cry in the past.

However, I wonder if there is a better way to handle your SIL's mean girl behavior.\n\nHow would she react if in the moment you just dished her attitude right back to her? Chuckle and say \"I didn't know Regina George was invited to Thanksgiving this year\" or just laugh and add \"really? How old are you?\" Because the way you handled kind of gave her what she wanted and will continue to encourage the behavior. She got you upset. Check. Got you to leave. Check. Probably caused conflict between you and your husband. Check. AND made you feel and look like the bad guy for leaving. Check.\n\nAlso, sure fire way to get your MIL off your back? \"I know my self worth and I'm not going to be insulted lying down everytime we are in a room together. I never start and will never start anything with SIL, but if she decides to pick a fight for no reason, I will stick up for myself and dish whatever she's serving right back to her.\" She will stop insisting you be at every family event (which is fine by you).", "NTA\n\nIf she\u2019s gossiping about you, she does it about everyone.\n\nThe fact everyone thinks it is ok behaviour is quite concerning.\n\nGood on you for calling her BS out, you absolutely do not need to put up with that lvl of BS.", "No, you have to set healthy boundaries. In a family that has chosen to ignore such toxic, childish behavior, I wouldn't expect support. However, there are other resources, a good friend or a trusted confidant. Your future child will be in a much healthier environment without that type of behavior being modeled and seemingly rewarded by the family. A young child should be corrected for that type of behavior, let alone an adult. Ew?....really? Set healthy boundaries and don't look back. That sil is a bully and is being shielded from consequences because the family members don't want to face her wrath.    Your new child doesn't need that, nobody does.", "NTA. The fact they they accused you of ruining Thanksgiving and not your SIL for her rude behavior says a lot. She \"is the way she is\" because her family has enabled her. Good for you for standing up for yourself and removing yourself from a toxic situation.", "I really like this! Sorry I don\u2019t have an award", "With the kids so they are not around  the toxicity  of sil and explaining this loud and clear  to the whole family  : they don't  correct the sil behavior  no unsupervised (by you) visits with your kids .\nNta", "Thank you so much!! I made it very clear to him that I will not be participating in Christmas as this was my last straw.", "She\u2019s bullied the whole family into dealing with her crap and I am just not going to deal with it", "Yes. we only have one, and he does not see his bio father. He lives with us full time", "if I said anything i\u2019m response she would immediately paint me as the instigator. She does it anyway I don\u2019t want to give it a basis", "in this case it was fine with me to let her win and give her what she wanted. getting into it with her woild cause more stress and drama during an already difficult time for that family and I opted to just calmly and quietly leave before I started to lose my shit", "NTA ! \n\nI was concerned that there were going to be like 7 other children and you were just focusing on having more! \n\nYour SIL clearly has some unresolved issues regarding children and pregnancy. I saw that her and her husband are childfree by choice. I am also childfree by choice. However I didn't then decide to become a child myself.\n\nKeep on standing up and being strong for yourself and kiddos.", "I was about to suggest couples therapy when I saw this response. I tend to jump on the therapy suggestion because I am a therapist, but there were major red flags going on here that really need to be addressed, especially since there are children in the relationship. NTA.", "I was thinking the same thing.", "they are not child free but had a vasectomy after their two. and very clearly wants more and that\u2019s why she wants to be involved", "Men get away with abuse all the damn time. Come on.", "Ahhh that makes a ton of sense. While it was responsible to not have more children, it seems your SIL needs some therapy to move past it. \n\nI'd suggest she foster if she really loves kids but honestly she seems like a shitty person soooo...", "Definitely true, but it's interesting why there is a JustNoMIL and not a JustNoFIL. There's something particular about women's family abuse that seems different from men's. Also interesting that subreddit is dominated by women. Not sure what to make of it."]}
