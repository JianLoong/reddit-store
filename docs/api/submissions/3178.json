We were friends. one day she was on the phone w her husband, they were fighting. He was with us. He had her on speaker. She started saying mean things about me & my fianc\u00e9 & our parenting for no reason,such random things? Said we let our son \u201clive\u201d w someone else (my other sil) bc he went over there to play 2 days in a row. Anyway, I tried talking to her about her comments and asked if I did something to make her angry at me. She said I am sensitive & need to get over myself. She made comments about our loss of a pregnancy/struggle to conceive. She said we needed to \u201cstop worrying about babies & focus on being parents.\u201d  I am unsure why she was saying these things. \n\nShe continued to be awful behind my back to my fianc\u00e9 when he would state that we are not hanging around her anymore bc of her behavior. I\u2019m pregnant & she is mad bc she was not allowed at the gender reveal. She tried to \u201capologize\u201d to me a few weeks before the reveal so she could come but apologized by saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry u were offended. I am sorry that you misconstrued what I said/took it out of context.\u201d & asking that we meet in person. I told her these were not apologies. I reminded her of what she said, why it was so hurtful. She didn\u2019t respond. I said she is not invited. At other family events she has been gossiping about me & I didn\u2019t want this at my parents home on an exciting day for me. After all, she said I shouldn\u2019t be having anymore kids. \n\nToday is the 1st thanksgiving w/o my fianc\u00e9s grandparents - they both passed this year. 5 minutes of being there, as I am talking to other family members, she walks by & says hello to my son, looks up at me as I am mid sentence, says \u201cEw\u201d and walks away. SIL is in her 30s & is being so juvenile. I told my fianc\u00e9 what happened. He said to ignore it. I said no, I wanted him to stay here with his family of course but I was going to leave. I don\u2019t want to be stressed while pregnant &I am uncomfortable. I go outside\n\nHim & MIL come out there saying not to ruin thanksgiving by leaving, that I shouldn\u2019t let it bother me and blah blah blah. I say I am uncomfortable with how she\u2019s treating me & I want to remove myself from the situation. MIL says \u201cwell I was very upset about her being excluded from the gender reveal & so was she.\u201d I state that\u2019s her own doing, this exact behavior is why she was. They said we should just be able to be cordial at events and I agreed & reminded them that I was doing absolutely nothing today when she started problems. \n\nI had my aunt come get me. His response is making me rethink being a part of this family. It seems they cater to her behavior, say it\u2019s just how she is. My MIL told me we just need to talk, asked what it\u2019ll take for me to allow SIL back into my life(my unborn child\u2019s life). In short i told her SIL does not see the fault in her actions & only \u201capologized\u201d bc she wanted to be at the reveal, there\u2019s no true remorse.. to me, nothing she can do.& I left. AITA for leaving?\n\nedit to add: both my fianc\u00e9 and MIL kept repeating i need to talk to SIL in person and at this point I don\u2019t want to. Her behavior and lack of remorse is narcissistic and my fianc\u00e9s other sister has stayed it\u2019s senseless trying to talk to her because of how she is. Friends have told me this and her family has too. I don\u2019t have a desire to talk in person to her anymore. We are past that \n my MIL is usually the sweetest person I know and tries desperately to make everyone happy. She apologized for her daughters behavior but reiterated that she can\u2019t control her. Nobody wants drama with the SIL so they just let her do what she wants and I told my MIL that\u2019s fine and that\u2019s why i\u2019m removing myself from a situation where I was made uncomfortable. Confronting her daughter would\u2019ve caused a scene and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t do it but at the same time, I should\u2019ve been allowed to leave without the guilt tripping. My MIL was on the verge of tears as she really seemed to want me there and said repeatedly that I am her daughter too. It\u2019s her first Thanksgiving without her parents. Additionally she\u2019s been a victim to her daughters bullying longer than any of us. she is not confrontational and I don\u2019t see her standing up to SIL. I\u2019ve seen and heard of SIL making her cry in the past.

SIL is in her 30s & is being so juvenile. I told my fianc\u00e9 what happened. He said to ignore it. I said no, I wanted him to stay here with his family of course but I was going to leave. I don\u2019t want to be stressed while pregnant &I am uncomfortable. I go outside\n\nFirst point of order: you were ignoring her just fine. She chose not only not to ignore you but to do an insult only an unimaginative third grader would consider worth saying out loud. \n\n>Him & MIL come out there saying not to ruin thanksgiving by leaving, that I shouldn\u2019t let it bother me and blah blah blah. \n\nSecond point of order: where were they with the \"don't ruin Thanksgiving!\" when SIL dropped her sick \"ew\" burn? \n\n>I say I am uncomfortable with how she\u2019s treating me & I want to remove myself from the situation. MIL says \u201cwell I was very upset about her being excluded from the gender reveal & so was she.\u201d \n\nCool. Where was MIL being \"very upset\" about the awful things SIL said to you, or when her apology was for you *daring* to have feelings about her rudeness rather than her rudeness itself? \n\n>I state that\u2019s her own doing, this exact behavior is why she was. They said we should just be able to be cordial at events and I agreed & reminded them that I was doing absolutely nothing today when she started problems. \n\nGood for you! She was the uncordial one, and one again nobody is talking her on her instigating words and behavior! \n\n>I had my aunt come get me. His response is making me rethink being a part of this family. It seems they cater to her behavior, say it\u2019s just how she is.\n\nAnd you are just who you are. How come that street is only one way? \n\n>My MIL told me we just need to talk,\n\nWhich you already did. \n\n>asked what it\u2019ll take for me to allow SIL back into my life(my unborn child\u2019s life). In short i told her SIL does not see the fault in her actions & only \u201capologized\u201d bc she wanted to be at the reveal, there\u2019s no true remorse.. to me, nothing she can do.& I left. AITA for leaving?\n\nNope. That family made SIL's behaviour both your problem and your fault. They did nothing to make SIL responsible for her aggressive behaviour. Why on earth would you want to stick around for a full day of that for even if you weren't pregnant? \n\n>edit to add: both my fianc\u00e9 and MIL kept repeating i need to talk to SIL in person and at this point I don\u2019t want to. Her behavior and lack of remorse is narcissistic and my fianc\u00e9s other sister has stayed it\u2019s senseless trying to talk to her because of how she is. Friends have told me this and her family has too.\n\n\"There's no point in talking to her but you need to talk to her!\" You already talked to her, her apology wasnt an apology, and again, why hasn't anybody been on SIL's case to talk?? \n\n>I don\u2019t have a desire to talk in person to her anymore. We are past that \n\nPerfectly reasonable stance even before\" ew\" based on what she said, but the \"ew\" cements that this woman has nothing of value to being to the conversation. \n\n> my MIL is usually the sweetest person I know and tries desperately to make everyone happy. \n\nExcept you. She's putting all the pressure on *you* to fix a thing you can't fix because you didn't break it. \n\n>She apologized for her daughters behavior but reiterated that she can\u2019t control her.\n\nNo point apologising for someone who isn't sorry and has made it clear they're going to keep doing it. \n\n>Nobody wants drama with the SIL so they just let her do what she wants\n\nClearly a plan with no flaws that has worked out excellently, as long as the family can keep emotionally manipulating her targets to silently accept her bullying. \n\n>and I told my MIL that\u2019s fine and that\u2019s why i\u2019m removing myself from a situation where I was made uncomfortable. Confronting her daughter would\u2019ve caused a scene and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t do it but at the same time, I should\u2019ve been allowed to leave without the guilt tripping.\n\nI love that you're demonstrating what an absolute killer of a great example you're going to be to your kids as they grow up, considering that's what your SIL chose to attack.\n\n> My MIL was on the verge of tears as she really seemed to want me there and said repeatedly that I am her daughter too. \n\nTHEN WHY IS SHE NOT CRYING AT HER OTHER DAUGHTER FOR CHASING FAMILY AWAY WITH HER HOSTILITY RATHER THAN DEMANDING A BULLIED PREGNANT WOMAN JUST SUCK IT UP?\n\n> It\u2019s her first Thanksgiving without her parents.\n\nK.  I mean maybe that sounds mean but apparently feelings don't matter unless they're SIL's so how is this relevant? \n\n>Additionally she\u2019s been a victim to her daughters bullying longer than any of us. she is not confrontational and I don\u2019t see her standing up to SIL. I\u2019ve seen and heard of SIL making her cry in the past. SIL is a cruel person.\n\nAnd MIL is the mother. It's sad that she can't stand up to her own daughter but demanding that you also stick around waiting for SIL to make you cry is irrational and unacceptable. If she doesn't want to impose consequences on SIL then the consequences are going to appear in other places.

I want to bring to attention that she's been saying things like this to him on the phone for a while. Has he been dismissing her, defending you, or has he been playing right along?

I do urge you to come up with a permanent solution. It could be practicing a number of responses and skillfully dodging her barbs.

MIL deserves to have a strong relationship with your child in the future so that will give her the incentive to accept invitations even if SIL isn\u2019t included.

The US is bad, but in some places DILs are actually beaten by their MILs and it\u2019s just accepted. \n\nAlso, when a woman\u2019s entire identity is about being a mother and a wife she is likely to be jealous and distrustful of any new women coming into the family that she sees as usurping her only power. Women who have a life outside of their children and their husband are much less likely to be shitty MILs.
