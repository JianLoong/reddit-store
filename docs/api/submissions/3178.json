We were friends. one day she was on the phone w her husband, they were fighting. He was with us. He had her on speaker. She started saying mean things about me & my fianc\u00e9 & our parenting for no reason,such random things? Said we let our son \u201clive\u201d w someone else (my other sil) bc he went over there to play 2 days in a row. Anyway, I tried talking to her about her comments and asked if I did something to make her angry at me. She said I am sensitive & need to get over myself. She made comments about my miscarriage/struggle to conceive. She said we needed to \u201cstop worrying about babies & focus on being parents.\u201d  I am unsure why she was saying these things. \n\nShe continued to be awful behind my back to my fianc\u00e9 when he would state that we are not hanging around her anymore bc of her behavior. I\u2019m pregnant & she is mad bc she was not allowed at the gender reveal. She tried to \u201capologize\u201d to me a few weeks before the reveal so she could come but apologized by saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry u were offended. I am sorry that you misconstrued what I said/took it out of context.\u201d I told her these were not apologies. I reminded her of what she said, why it was so hurtful. She didn\u2019t respond. I said she is not invited. At other family events she has been gossiping about me & I didn\u2019t want this at my parents home on an exciting day for me. After all, she said I shouldn\u2019t be having anymore kids. \n\nToday is the 1st thanksgiving w/o my fianc\u00e9s grandparents - they both passed this year. 5 minutes of being there, as I am talking to other family members, she walks by & says hello to my son, looks up at me as I am mid sentence, says \u201cEw\u201d and walks away. SIL is in her 30s & is being so juvenile. I told my fianc\u00e9 what happened. He said to ignore it. I said no, I wanted him to stay here with his family of course but I was going to leave. I don\u2019t want to be stressed while pregnant &I am uncomfortable. I go outside\n\nHim & MIL come out there saying not to ruin thanksgiving by leaving, that I shouldn\u2019t let it bother me and blah blah blah. I say I am uncomfortable with how she\u2019s treating me & I want to remove myself from the situation. MIL says \u201cwell I was very upset about her being excluded from the gender reveal & so was she.\u201d I state that\u2019s her own doing, this exact behavior is why she was. They said we should just be able to be cordial at events and I agreed & reminded them that I was doing absolutely nothing today when she started problems. \n\nI had my aunt come get me. His response is making me rethink being a part of this family. It seems they cater to her behavior, say it\u2019s just how she is. My MIL told me we just need to talk, asked what it\u2019ll take for me to allow SIL back into my life(my unborn child\u2019s life). In short i told her SIL does not see the fault in her actions & only \u201capologized\u201d bc she wanted to be at the reveal, there\u2019s no true remorse.. to me, nothing she can do.& I left.

I would personally reconsider being in that family. \n\nAlso, your fianc\u00e9 saying you should simply ignore it is pretty much what he is doing : he is seeing you being mistreated by his family and instead of standing up for his future wife, he chooses to ignore it.
