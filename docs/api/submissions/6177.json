She shouldn't have cried wolf so many times.", "NTA\n\nEveryone and their mother is going to refer to a certain story from when we were kids. She very clearly didn't get it or never read the story. Either way, when you make repeated \"jokes\" people are going to stop paying attention. Quite honestly, that shit ain't even funny in the first place.", "NTA.

That's her doing not yours.", "If you want people to believe you about something important, then don't make a habit of lying about important things.\n\nNTA, you pulled her aside and didn't do it in front of everyone. That's pretty much the most a liar can ever hope for when people stop believing their lies.\n\nSerious advise for any other liars out there. Own your shit. Acknowledge and apologize for lying and insist this time is real. If it's not real though, expect never to be believed again.", "YTA.  I know people will disagree with me on that.  But let's say SIL is in the habit of randomly announcing pregnancy when she's not pregnant?  Who does that hurt?  The whole family was used to it, to the point where it didn't bother them.  It might  be an annoying thing to do, but the family was used to those shenanigans.\n\nSo come Christmas, you think she's pulling the same shit.  So what?  If she's bluffing again...no harm, no foul.  No need to get all up in her grill for being stupid.  If she's not bluffing, nobody will believe her at this point.  But it's not your problem.\n\nYTA not for what you did, but because it was not necessary, and so it just caused unnecessary drama.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then you snap. Whether she was really pregnant is not relevant. You would also be TA were she not pregnant.\n\nEdit: I feel a lot of the responses are based on the title and body alone.

It happened over months, more than enough time to talk to her in a normal way. Absolutely a dick move to wait untill you snap.\n\nYou also misread.

If there is no immediate harm, there is no need for yelling.\n\nIf op also stated that she has been asked to stop and she's continuing just to be annoying, then it would be different. SIL could also be an AH, but there is not enough context to conclude that.\n\nPlus a dishonest title. If op wants to know if he's TA for yelling, he should put that in the title. \"Telling SIL to stop\" is what he should have done instead of yelling.", "Corrected, thank you"]}
