I would think peace with my neighbors would be worth it in that case. Also what are the neighbors doing with the puppies? \n\nDemand for mixed breed puppies (or puppies in general) these days are pretty high. Mixed breeds generally because people are more conscious of the long term health benefits vs pure breed dogs (which are still more expensive but anyway..). If the neighbors end up trying to sell them they could get them for a couple hundred a pup.", "Most vets I've known won't snip larger breeds until 1yr old, because it messes with their hormones and could affect their growth  or, more likely, their bones strength. I'm not a vet, not sure how true that is, but it's the prevalent attitude around me.", "My dogs\u2019 breeders have it written into their contracts that the puppies can\u2019t be spayed or neutered until they\u2019re 2. A vet told me that on average, you can be reasonably confident that the growth plates close around 20 months. Waiting until the two-year mark set forth by the breeder contract covers that.\n\nI never thought it was hard to keep an intact male from breeding. We have a high wooden fence and keep an eye on things. My dogs are leashed when they are out, for safety reasons other than unplanned litters. I\u2019m not sure I believe this story because I\u2019m almost positive I\u2019ve seen it posted here before almost verbatim, but OP is NTA in my opinion."]}
