A few days ago, she was yelling for Kyle to come to her room. I asked her what happened. She explained that Kyle flipped all her items upside down. I called Kyle to come and flip everything right side up.\n\nYesterday, Ryan was running into her room and kept stealing her stuff, while she ran to get them back. On the night of the same day, Lara was trying to sleep, when the brothers suddenly barged in and ran through it, resulting in her screaming at them to stay out and close the door while she was sleeping, to give a few examples.\n\nToday in the morning, her father (48m) told her he didn't like the way she was screaming. She said that she was trying to sleep and her brothers were making all kinds of ruckus. He told her that they are kids and they will learn. She said that they will never learn and the only way for them to learn is to have locks installed for her room. He did not want her to and they went back and forth on this until she threatened she would move out as soon as she became financially independent since she wasn't going to wait for them to mature and they should already know to respect her privacy to which he said to wait to include me in the conversation.\n\nI overheard, and when she went to her room, I told her she wasn't going to have locks set up because she already wastes her time without the need for locks and I don't want her to fail. Lara said that they were never going to listen without them and I told her that I would make sure they wouldn't enter her room.\n\nThis evening, I heard her shouting for me. We were all in the living room. Her father explained what was going on. Lara said that she was making Kyle tea when he did he's not allowed to do. She said that she was going to tell on them and he said that if she promises to not tell, he and Ryan will never go into her room again. She didn't say anthing so they ran upstairs to her room.\n\nI told her that she has no right to complain since she always sleeps in Kyle's room after school. Her brothers all agree and Lara calls all of us the worst, none of us are allowed in her room, and leaves. She comes back after a minute and says that she only sleeps in Kyle's room because he never uses it aside from sleeping at night, and if he was to use it for studying, then she would never go there. Meanwhile, they constantly disturb her, mess with her stuff, and made her unable to sleep just last night.\n\nI told her if they ever go into her room, she needs to go to me. Then Kyle starts saying that they had the right to go into her room while she was trying to sleep because they were playing. Lara yelled at him, then said that she couldn't wait to move out soon so she no longer has to deal with them. She also called me an awful mother for not giving her her bedroom locks.", "created_utc": 1667788079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yoa7t2/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_have_locks_for/", "score": 3568, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They wreck her room, ignore her right to privacy, and barge in when she's sleeping. What exactly have you done to impress on your sons that this behaviour is not acceptable? They're old enough to know better so why don't they?", "Yta. Parent your children. A 12 and 9 year old shouldn't be acting like this. Also, have you considered your daughter has trouble concentrating/wasting her time because of your unruly boys that you refuse to discipline?", "YTA. Y'all let your boys do whatever and blame her for it. Maybe the reason she gets bad grades is because she doesn't get enough sleep and can't concentrate with boys running all over her room? You did nothing to the boys and even let them *tell you the parent* that they are still going to go in there and disobey you and you did nothing.", "YTA\n\n> brothers Kyle (12m) and Ryan (9m) constantly disrespecting her privacy.\n\nWhy the fuck are you tolerating that kind of shit? Parent your children, already!", "YTA and so is your husband. There would be no need for locks if you disciplined your sons when they invaded her privacy. She's 17 and a woman. She does not need little boys constantly barging into her private space.", "YTA\n\nA 17 year old deserves privacy. Why is your inability to keep your younger kids under control her problem?\n\nEither get her a lock or parent your sons.\n\nDon\u2019t expect to have a relationship with her after she gets out.", "Why on earth are you allowing your younger children to act like that?\n\nMessing with their sister's things and disrupting her study time is bad enough. Running through the room while she's sleeping is even worse.\n\nYTA for allowing this bad behavior and for not getting a lock.\n\nMy parents put a lock on my door when I was 9 to keep my younger siblings out of my private space because they respected me enough to not allow my belongings to be destroyed by their children", "YTA. Control your children. Listen to your daughter. She's a few months away from being a legal adult and doesn't want her young brothers in her room. They are destructive and loud. You may have a daughter that moves out and cuts you off.", "YTA\n\nI don't hear any parenting in your post. Where are the rules being put down by the parents? Where are the consequences that you've told them they will all receive for violating the rules? Where is the enforcing of the consequences? Sounds like the kids run the house.", "YTA...and not a very caring Mom. \n\nObviously your sons are the favorite and your daughter is just expected to deal with their lack of boundaries and bad behavior. Is she your step-daughter by any chance? Because it sounds like how you are treating her.  \n\nYour daughter is 17 and will be legally allowed to leave home very soon- and you & your husband's attitudes is telling her that you don't care.  Your boys are 12 & 9 old enough to know right from wrong and respect privacy boundaries. If they don't -that is on YOU. \n\nThey should have consequences to their actions and misbehavior. But it doesn't sound like there is - at least for the boys.  You make excuses for their behavior, don't really LISTEN to your daughter and expect her to wait around until they 'mature'.  Tell me, how old was your daughter when you taught HER boundaries and about privacy? I'm betting younger than 10. \n\nFor the short time your daughter is still with you I suggest you allow her locks on the door and tell the boys that if they pound on the door, disturb her when she is sleeping etc. that there will be punishments involved.  A 17 year old girl should have some privacy from her little brothers and they shouldn't be allowed to run rampant through her room and use it as a playroom. \n\nDon't be surprised if you relationship continues to deteriorate as time goes on because you and your husband treat her like her feelings don't matter - and by extension she doesn't, only the boys matter.  She sees it. She feels it.  She will eventually go LC or NC with you because of the hurt(s) you have inflicted on her.  \n\nThis is SO much more than a lock on a bedroom door. I am sad you can't see that. Do better while you have the chance.  You're running out of time.", "YTA\n\nIf you and your husband refuse to discipline your younger kids, at least let Lara have a lock on her door. It sounds like she's miserable. I wouldn't blame her a bit if she cuts all contact once she manages to move out.", "YTA. Your daughter is trying to explain to you how she is overwhelmed and need her space. Her boundaries are constantly invaded by her younger siblings. She is always on alert because she isn't sure when the kids will jump in. She is trying to find a quiet space for herself. She offered a suggestion and you constantly denied her.\n\nWhy can't she have a lock for her room? Is it such a big thing? How come her younger siblings are not learning about personal space? They are 9 and 12 years old. The boys are old enough to realise that it is not acceptable to keep walking into people's bedroom.", "YTA. Don't act all shocked Pikachu when she makes good on her threat & moves out. She's almost an adult you should start treating her like one if you want a relationship. You're a also allowing your younger kids to behave like feral animals. YTA. Get her a lock.", "YTA. Either secure the door or secure the brothers.", "Your daughter is right. Kyle and Ryan will never learn. You know why? BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT DOING JACK SHIT TO TEACH THEM. And how are they going to learn if you don't teach them?  \n\n\nI can't tell you whether you need to put locks on your daughter's door or not, but you need to step in and do something. Punish your sons if they ever go in her room for anything, at all, ever. Bright line rule. They are not allowed to go in there for any reason. And if they do, you need to lay the hammer down on them. \n\nI'm not going to say you're the A for not putting locks on Lara's door. But YTA certainly for not doing anything to prevent this situation and for not disciplining or teaching your sons.", "Info: why are you not dealing with your sons disrespecting their sister so much? At 12 and 9 they absolutely know what they're doing, that you continue to let them pick on her. Why?", "YTA. Teach your sons some respect. Also, get your daughter some locks for some privacy.", "YTA, its wierd that you would not let a teeange girl have lock on her door. She needs privacy, changing etc. Do you allow locks on her bathroom?", "YTA. Your daughter deserves to have privacy and the ability to not be disturbed in her own room. You are showing her that you put her brothers over her and that won\u2019t be good for your future relationship with her.", "YTA\n\nYou are an awful mother because you are enabling shitty behavior from her siblings and her right to privacy.\n\nAnd don't give me that \"my house my rules\" nonsense. A teen has a right to lock her door so people don't enter her room and take her stuff. A teen has a right to change clothes in her room without worrying about someone walking in on her. A teen has a right to have some sense of privacy and a safe area in their home that cannot be invaded by others at any time.", "YTA... You are the parent, figure it out. If you cant keep your kids out of your daughters room, get her a lock. She deserves some privacy.", "YTA and it will be a wild shock to you when she fails or leaves home and doesn't look back because you refuse to parent your sons or respect your daughter.", "YTA \n\nWhy are you allowing your sons to do whatever they want? Your daughter has to suffer because of you and your husband lack of parenting skills. Y\u2019all trying to control the daughter meanwhile your boys running around like wild animals. Either let her have a lock on her door or learn to discipline your boys.", "YTA big time.  She is at an age where she needs her privacy.  She's put y'all on notice that she's getting out ASAP.   Don't be surprised if she goes NC with y'all because you allowed her brothers to run rough shot all up and through her space and then you get mad at her because she gets upset. Unbelievable!!  It's clear to see that you favor her brothers.", "YTA.\n\nParent your children for fuck\u2019s sake.", "A. This is confusing.\nB. YTA\n\nI got a lock on my door when I was 12. Teenagers need privacy, and to not have siblings messing with their stuff.", ">*Lara (17f) has been struggling to focus on her studies with* ***her brothers Kyle (12m) and Ryan (9m) constantly disrespecting her privacy.***  \n>  \n>ETA: *they constantly disturb her, mess with her stuff, and made her unable to sleep just last night.*\n\nMassive YTA. Your sons ~~sound like~~ are spoiled little monsters, and she has every right to her privacy. Your husband reprimands her for yelling them? How about the two of you, you know,  parenting them?\n\nDon't be surprised when she moves out and goes NC with all of you.", "YTA\n\nNot because of the locks but because you haven\u2019t established boundaries with all of your children. If you are constantly hearing your children yelling at each other about the same things why haven\u2019t you had a sit down conversation with them about it?\n\nEveryone wants and needs their own private spaces and most of the time that space is your bedroom. Yes, some people are fine with people entering their bedrooms, but if you have one child who does not want others in their bedroom without their permission, then make it fair for everyone. You need to sit all the kids down and explain that no one goes into another person's room without permission.\n\nYou might want to also talk to them about respecting other people's belongings.\n\nYou also want to consider that your oldest is almost an adult meaning that she is going to expect to be treated as the adult she\u2019s going to turn into. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a lock on the door especially if you have a key to get in if an emergency arises, You should be able to trust your daughter to be able to be in her bedroom alone. If not, then you might want to reflect on how you\u2019ve been raising her up till this point.", "YTA. You won\u2019t let her have a lock because you don\u2019t want her to fail her classes, but you also aren\u2019t stopping her brothers from running into her room and bothering her while she studies? \n\nIf you can\u2019t step up as a parent and deal with your son\u2019s behavior, then at least give your daughter the ability to have some privacy.", "Yta- why not compromise? Let her have locks, but you get a key too. That way it keeps her sibling free, but you can enter if needed/ in emergencies.", "Let me guess. Your sons can behave like feral animals because they are boys, and boys are more important to you and your husband. YTA - all of you except your daughter. JFC - parent your sons and treat your daughter with some respect.", "YTA", "YTA it's even worse this happened in the age where your child wants to have independence", "YTA\n\nIt's ridiculous that she doesn't already have a lock on her door, and it's ridiculous that you're opposing her 100% reasonable choice to pursue privacy.", "Yta.\n\nYou are the parent, so get your sons to behave. They need to be taught to respect other people's privacy and boundaries. They are old enough to understand those concepts.\n\nFurthermore, your daughter deserves privacy and a place to retreat without anyone barging in.\n\nTo be honest it sounds like you are failing your daughter just like your sons. Dont set them up for failure please.", "YTA\n\nYou won't help her establish boundaries with her rambunctious brothers and you won't let her take measures to protect her privacy & belongings.  I don't quite understand why she's napping in Kyle's room but it's a pretty sad commentary that she feels less likely to be disturbed there than in her own room. \n\n>Today in the morning, her father (48m) told her he didn't like the way she was screaming.

You haven't said one thing about what you've done to stop these two brats. They're brats because you are allowing it. Let her have the privacy she needs at 17. She needs the lock.  Stop letting those boys run wild, you will regret it when they're teens.", "YTA. If you don't want to parent your son's, at least give your teenage daughter the ability to keep her space private and safe. Not sure why you are showing your son's favoritism, anyway. The whole \"boys will be boys\" mentality is bullshit. YOU have to teach them how to show people respect. And you're failing. And you very well might lose your daughter because of it.", "YTA. Your sons are old enough to respect privacy. You are just letting them get away with it, and your husband's response is to yell at your daughter.\n\nIf they were running in and out of your room, stealing items, waking you up, messing with your stuff, and generally harassing you every time you sat down to pay bills you wouldn't put up with it.

A few days ago, she was yelling for Kyle to come to her room. I asked her what happened. She explained that Kyle flipped all her items upside down. I called Kyle to come and flip everything right side up.\n\nYesterday, Ryan was running into her room and kept stealing her stuff, while she ran to get them back. On the night of the same day, Lara was trying to sleep, when the brothers suddenly barged in and ran through it, resulting in her screaming at them to stay out and close the door while she was sleeping, to give a few examples.\n\nToday in the morning, her father (48m) told her he didn't like the way she was screaming. She said that she was trying to sleep and her brothers were making all kinds of ruckus. He told her that they are kids and they will learn. She said that they will never learn and the only way for them to learn is to have locks installed for her room. He did not want her to and they went back and forth on this until she threatened she would move out as soon as she became financially independent since she wasn't going to wait for them to mature and they should already know to respect her privacy to which he said to wait to include me in the conversation.\n\nI overheard, and when she went to her room, I told her she wasn't going to have locks set up because she already wastes her time without the need for locks and I don't want her to fail. Lara said that they were never going to listen without them and I told her that I would make sure they wouldn't enter her room.\n\nThis evening, I heard her shouting for me. We were all in the living room. Her father explained what was going on. Lara said that she was making Kyle tea when he did he's not allowed to do. She said that she was going to tell on them and he said that if she promises to not tell, he and Ryan will never go into her room again. She didn't say anthing so they ran upstairs to her room.\n\nI told her that she has no right to complain since she always sleeps in Kyle's room after school. Her brothers all agree and Lara calls all of us the worst, none of us are allowed in her room, and leaves. She comes back after a minute and says that she only sleeps in Kyle's room because he never uses it aside from sleeping at night, and if he was to use it for studying, then she would never go there. Meanwhile, they constantly disturb her, mess with her stuff, and made her unable to sleep just last night.\n\nI told her if they ever go into her room, she needs to go to me. Then Kyle starts saying that they had the right to go into her room while she was trying to sleep because they were playing. Lara yelled at him, then said that she couldn't wait to move out soon so she no longer has to deal with them. She also called me an awful mother for not giving her her bedroom locks.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What she needs is a door knob with a lock that uses a key, like you put on a door going outside.  She can lock it from the outside or inside.", "Personally, if I\u2019m using a room for study, I try to minimise sleeping there because it distracts from sleep. Where\u2019s her respected study zone, can she book time in parent\u2019s office or section of the den?\n\nHaving a \u201cchill zone\u201d (couch away from study space, a spare room), or - as this seems to be in this situation, - a sibling\u2019s room which is unused and free for a few hours undisturbed and away from the books nap\u2026 well, it\u2019s more conducive than surrounded by study materials 24-7!\n\nIn saying that, organising a study carrol or book rooms at a library, giving her a lift for study sessions with friends elsewhere? \nAND signing up bratty brothers for activities like camping, scouts, martial arts or dance will get them out of the way!\nAnd yeah - a 12 year old setting a horrible example for his brother and not respecting a WOMAN\u2019S privacy is key here too. \nYTA. \nI suspect this young, hardworking and sleep-deprived woman is off to university if she can catch a break to finish her work - and I\u2019d be surprised if she comes back after.", "Because Kyle won't trash his own room to piss her off.", "I think all boundaries needs to be respected. She needs to stop sleeping in his room. If he thinks that his room is fair game, why isn't hers? \n\nI do agree that the parents are useless in stopping the boys being disruptive and disrespectful to the girl.\n\nLet her have a lock and Laura needs to stop sleeping in Kyle's room.", "That\u2019s what you find weird in all this?", "That was another thing, I dont understand their rationale behind not getting the daughter locks because \u00abshe already wastes her time without the need for locks and I don\u2019t want her to fail\u00bb. How would locks be causing her to fail but what she\u2019s going through now isnt? The mental leaps, I swear.", "Bet it was this rotten and spoiled sister that left as soon she was independent enough without ever thinking of what she has done to the poor family who has been always so nice and kind against her\u2026", "I bet from the tone of OPs writing that if the kids barged in Lara's room and the kids happened to see a bra or a pad Lara would get screamed at. I hope the daughter leaves if OP won't fix those kids mentality quick", "People find mental leaps and that would win Olympics records to justify their utterly contradictory views. I find myself sitting down trying to figure out some people's utterly and I mean utterly ridiculous contradictions that they wholeheartedly believe. It's fascinating but also infuriating. A lock would make the house so much easier (or no lock and some basic f-ing discipline), yet they won't because.....why?\n\nEdit - predictive text correction"]}
