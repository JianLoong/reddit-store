That would go over very well at any white elephant I\u2019ve ever been to, but I\u2019ve never been to one with my family before. Maybe reserve it for a friend-based white elephant next time.", "Definitely in that it's so wrong it's right category.  NTA", "NTA.\n\n\nWell maybe you are one, but that's for not sharing the pictures !!!", "NTA. Isn\u2019t the point of White Elephant to be ridiculous? That sounds pretty ridiculous. Whoever received it sounds like a party pooper.", "Love it. Can you buy it online?", "NTA. She sounds like a killjoy.

Can you buy it online?", "NTA aren\u2019t white elephant gifts supposed to be dirty?", "I prayed to Sky-Daddy\u2026\n\nand tho said NTA", "I hear you saying that your family isn't super religious, but you all do go to church occasionally.  I think this gift definitely crosses the line, and just because someone isn't in church every week doesn't mean they don't respect their faith.  Sometimes I have seen people who aren't regular church goers be more respectful of their religion than the ones in the pews every week.  Tip for the future: don't buy a gift making fun of the religion you all participate in.  I would say YTA in this case.", "NTA. Your family souffle be having white elephants if they're gonna get offended at something like that. The entire point of white elephants is to give super dumb gifts, which you totally nailed. Honestly a gift like that would have been the in demand one at every white elephant I've ever been to.", "NTA. I mean, if it's all fun and games, and it's with family members who are all adults, AND the gifts get raunchy, it shouldn't be a problem.", "NTA but I'm biased because this made me laugh so much \ud83e\udd23", "Soft YTA - Just because someone isn't propping up a pew every Sunday it doesn't mean they don't have a religious faith, they just prefer to keep it private, and unless you really are sure that this type of gift wouldn't offend someone you should never try it. There's also a difference between risque and raunchy gifts and offensive ones, even if they're not offensive to you, and religion is a minefield best avoided unless you are looking for drama.", "YTA- you had to know that at this time of the year, someone was gonna get offended.", "Soft YTA. It sounds like you would have put that gift in the exchange if you thought it would have offended anyone. But it's generally known to keep politics and religion away from these things.", "YTA", "Soft YTA but I don't know how your family are. Are sexual jokes common?", "YTA. The idea of \"sexy Jesus\" could have been funny, but the \"Step-Daddy\" part makes it entirely tasteless and inappropriate.", "YTA..wtf??? That\u2019s so weird it is not funny. Sorry OOP, but that crossed a line and you know it. I\u2019m sorry, but you are about to spend some extended time apologizing for this. The \u201cstep \nDaddy\u201d inscription is super concerning to everyone.", "YTA but not a huge one.  This would have been a safe gift for a party full of atheist activists.

A very specific meme of this genre (which may be derived from a particular scene) is where the woman is \"stuck\" in a seemingly lascivious position and asks the stepbrother to \"help\".\n\nExtrapolating that to Jesus being God (and son of god) well, you get a unique play of the meme", "Seconded!
