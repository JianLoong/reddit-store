I'm just now to the point where I'm feeling better and able to do many of my normal things.  When I was in the hospital or had just had procedures done I often didn't feel like talking to anyone.  It was also stressful because we were waiting for 9 months for an infection to clear up enough to have surgery. It really stressed me out when family (well meaning and very lovingly) wanted to know what the next step was.

Luckily, everyone in my life understood I needed time to heal and they'd reach out to my mom to check on me and offer their best wishes instead of calling or texting me.

When I don't feel well, I am not the best host.", "NTA. Honestly I separated myself and my family (my husband was happy to do so) from our church years ago. I have always been a private person and the constant interference in our lives was too much. The last straw was after we had our daughter. In our church babies are expected to go to the nursery during the service so they don\u2019t cry and disrupt the pastor. Well exposing a new baby to a nursery full of other infants and toddlers will probably get the kid sick. It was a constant rotation of baby in the nursery on Sunday and by Wednesday or Thursday we were at the doctor.  Repeat every two weeks. This was a full term, healthy breastfeed baby. I finally asked the pediatrician what I could do to keep her from getting sick so often. He said to not go back to church and put her in the nursery until she got a few months older, especially until she could get all her vaccinations.  One of the church members said that the doctor was sent by satan to keep us from church.", "Definitely NTA!

If they ignored requests not to call unless they were specifically told he was ready to hear from them, they deserve all the rudeness you can throw at them.  \n\nHe has every right to only see and hear from his inner circle if that's what he wants.

I'd really like an explanation about what's fun about talking to or visiting someone who isn't themself.", "NTA during that time your desire for space should have been respected because you were the only one who was contactable, your husband was not in a state to communicate with them so they were making demands upon You \n\nIt is wrong that they were going after you so hard to satisfy their own emotional wants at your direct detriment, and now they are speaking disrespectfully about you to your husband? That's bullshit and it sounds like a reason to leave your church community given that they've now cussed you out", "Most people feel bad because no one seems to care that they are sick .", "NTA\nIt's sad that some people care more about gossip than they care about people who are supposed to be friends.\n\nYou definitely did the right thing.\n\nI had a huge surgery a couple of years ago, it was a long surgery and went well, however following surgery I had complications and was very ill. Just talking to close family was very tiring. Thankfully I couldn't have visitors as it was during a covid lockdown and visiting wasn't allowed. I couldn't have coped with even close family visiting.\n\nSo I know from experience that too many phonecalls and visits can be far too tiring and ultimately harmful. Because it was lockdown I made the decision not to tell anyone other than very close family that I was going into hospital, specifically for this reason and being during lockdown made that possible. \n\nYou did what was best for your husband. \nIf anyone thinks you are an asshole that's thier problem and shows that they are not interested in Your husband's welfare, just thier own curiosity.", "I think it all depends on the person and their wants. The one time I was in the hospital, I became kind of depressed and lonely. It didn't help that I really wasn't particularly sick, I had had atrial fibrillation for the first time, and the day after I was in urgent care, I went to my doctor, who noticed an unusual heart rhythm that turns out to be normal for me, but can mean problems in some cases, and she called an ambulance to take me to the hospital. I'm usually fairly introverted, but I have a few close friends that I really like being around. My wife spent most of her time at the hospital with me when she could, but she did have to work. It REALLY made my day when my best friend, his wife, and a couple others came to visit. Snapped me right out of my loneliness.\n\nMy afib hasn't come back in more than 10 years since I've been on a beta blocker, and I've not needed to be in the hospital since. But if it happens again, I truly hope I get some visitors if I find myself feeling like I did again. Obviously, not everyone is the same.\n\nRegardless... People need to read the room. If the patient is acting like they want to be alone, leave them the hell alone. People heal in different ways.", "Depends what you are in for. I went in as a child for a small procedure. It was an alien place and I felt very scared and out of place. Family visitors were an absolute godsend.\n\nThough I can completely understand some people, especially with certain conditions, can't cope with visitors - no matter how well meaning. But a bored adult, feeling isolated but capable of coping with visitors, might very much welcome the interest such a visit might bring.", "Same when I had mine in October 2020. I told everybody well ahead of time that the hospital only allowed one visitor who would obviously be my husband. A couple of weeks before baby came, I was told they had changed the restrictions to one visitor at a time instead of one, period. Did I tell anyone of those changes? No, somehow I never got around to sharing the change. Oops?", "depends on the visitors as well - some will focus on making you feel better and/or distracting you from whatever is going on, and others will spend visiting time causing more anxiety or asking you to reassure them. i love my mom, but she can be very overbearing and i wanted her visits kept very short when i was in hospital. on the other hand, a friend with a card game and some gossip was more than welcome.", "Of course a child's needs are different, and maybe some adults. If it is medically cleared and the patient wants visits, fine. I remember my sister's minister was hospitalized. Practically every member of the church thought they should visit. Even if the patient wants visits, a stream of steady visitors would be tiring. When my mom was in the hospital, my two sisters and I would rotate who would go. One in the morning, one in the evening. The non visiting sister would be on phone visits. My mom loved visits, but she would never turn them down, even if she felt bad. She said if people took the time to trek to San Francisco, she would not stop them. A few people we had to ask to cut back, based on medical advice for the day.", "Let me guess. These same church people love to gossip under the guise of \"just telling you so you can be praying for her\"\n\nNTA", "Tell them \"why are you willing to put your wants ahead of my husband's recovery?\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your husband is lucky to have you advocating for him. Maybe you can look for a new church together when he's feeling better.", "NTA, please talk to your church priest/minister.

Where exactly is the joy? Her husband just went through a rough surgery. \n\nJust proves that it\u2019s all about them and their experience of being \u201cgood people\u201d and they don\u2019t care about his experience or boundaries at all", "It all usually depends on how ill you are while you are in. I've been in hospital on some occasions and been crawling the walls through boredom and living for visits. On other occasions not wanted visits because I've felt too ill. During my last visit to hospital. Two weeks in a side room with no visitors due to covid restrictions, I didn't want visitors and even struggled with talking to people on the telephone. I was deathly ill on that occasion and I was relieved my parents couldn't visit because it would have been too upsetting for them to see just how ill I was. Visitors can be nice and even vital for mental health, but they can also be problematic."]}
