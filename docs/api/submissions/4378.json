Things didn't go well, and it started to rupture during the surgery. A big mess, lots of pus and infection. Took three hours instead of a quick 45 minutes.\n\nThe next day in the aftermath I told my husband I was taking his cell phone from him because he was in a bad way and I could see that the constant calls and messages were stressing him out. I was worried because he was the sickest I'd ever seen.  I kept possession of the phone through his home coming and a few days after until he told me he felt better and would welcome a few calls from family only.\n\nFamily wasn't the problem, it was nosy church people. During the time I had his phone I told his callers that he'd get in touch with him when he was ready and to please not call in order to keep the line open for our children and family. One went so far as to try and \"just drop by\" twenty minutes after we got home. I rebuffed her, telling her that he'd contact her when he was better.\n\nHe's only this afternoon felt well enough to call a few friends back, and all of them complained to him I was some sort of enormous asshole for limiting contacts during his hospitalization. He told them I was protecting him, and that he was appreciative of me giving him space to start to heal from everyone. I've had to tell a few more today that he's still not ready for visitors and we're spending hours a day going back and forth to the hospital for him to get outpatient antibiotics ivs. Just got cussed out for being a killjoy and called an asshole.", "created_utc": 1670644170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhi1wv/aita_for_limiting_contact_after_surgery/", "score": 372, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm just now to the point where I'm feeling better and able to do many of my normal things.  When I was in the hospital or had just had procedures done I often didn't feel like talking to anyone.  It was also stressful because we were waiting for 9 months for an infection to clear up enough to have surgery. It really stressed me out when family (well meaning and very lovingly) wanted to know what the next step was.  We often didn't know...we knew I needed surgery but just couldn't do anything at the time.  I had to have my mom be the one to talk about that stuff with family because it was too much for me.  I needed to focus on healing.\n\nYour husband didn't need to deal with all of that.  It's a caregivers job to run interference on possible guests and send them in their way if the patient isn't up to visitors or if the visit runs too long.  If other people can't accept that then that's their problem, not yours.", "Info: did your husband ask you to do this? Was there a conversation about it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I sympathize with your husband. I had a Gallbladder removal gone wrong a few years ago and it us brutal to recover from. Luckily, everyone in my life understood I needed time to heal and they'd reach out to my mom to check on me and offer their best wishes instead of calling or texting me. Basic manners should tell you not to incessantly call someone who is ill or recovering, and you definitely shouldn't invite yourself over while they're recovering, especially with covid still hanging around.", "INFO: Is you husband the pastor or deacon?

NTA.", "They should thank OP, her not sharing details will just give them more to talk about which is all they care about anyway", "He gratefully handed it over. He handed it over, I said do you might if i keep it until you are better? Even rejecting visitors was his idea.  I don't like playing prison warden, but he was so sick.", "There was a conversation about it once it was obvious he was incapable of answering and dealing with the pain at the same time.

Learn from this who the toxic people are and cut them out.", "NTA I was recently in your husband\u2019s position. It will take MONTHS for him to feel better. He gets to dictate the pace of his recovery- not the church congregation\u2026", "Church people used such language? They'll make baby Jesus cry.\n\nNTA. You did what you had to do to help your husband recover. When he gets back on his feet, maybe you should go church shopping.", "Yeah, this sounds like an opportunity for the religious leader or church administrator to get a nice little note from OP to distribute saying he's recovering well, he's exhausted, and he needs time to rest in quiet. We will give updates when we are ready, but he is not able to take phone calls or visitors at this time. In the meantime, we appreciate thoughts/prayers/tributes and tiktoks in his honor/meals dropped to the porch/etc., and we thank all for your concern and patience. \n\nSure, well intentioned concern, it sounds like, but poor execution can genuinely and easily make things worse.", "You're not wrong.

One lady asked a lot of invasive questions, and said something like she needed to know exactly what was going on so she could tell everybody. It was disgusting. My grandmother was in agony, and this woman was practically rubbing her hands together in glee, just because she wanted to feed the rumour mill.\n\nIn the end my dad spoke to their churches minister, and asked him to let the gossipy hags know Gran needed space and time with her family, and they backed off, which was just as well because we were poised to give them an earful.", "LOL THIS MADE ME CACKLE.

Ruptured colon collapsed lung pneumonia sepsis. He was hospitalized 28 days and at one point the dr told me make sure I called the immediate family to come in asap. He was in ICU at that point. When your spouse child etc  any loved one you are tasked with caring for needs medical assistance it is time to go Momma Bear mode. Have them announce at church and put in bulletin and church fb page that he is slightly better but not seeing anyone or taking calls and he will reach out when he feels able. You have noth8ng to feel guilty about. Keep screening those calls until he tells you he doesn\u2019t need you to. Tell him let you know when that day happens. You have both been through a traumatic event and for him a physical situation that will stay in his mind as well as the physical reminders. Hang in there and wishing him a full recovery.", "NTA You are doing what both you and your husband decided is best for your family.

Me, leave me the F alone lol.", "This is my entire job, I set patients up for home infusion, mostly IV antibiotics!
