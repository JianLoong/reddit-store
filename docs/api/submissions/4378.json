Things didn't go well, and it started to rupture during the surgery. A big mess, lots of pus and infection. Took three hours instead of a quick 45 minutes.\n\nThe next day in the aftermath I told my husband I was taking his cell phone from him because he was in a bad way and I could see that the constant calls and messages were stressing him out. I was worried because he was the sickest I'd ever seen.  I kept possession of the phone through his home coming and a few days after until he told me he felt better and would welcome a few calls from family only.\n\nFamily wasn't the problem, it was nosy church people. During the time I had his phone I told his callers that he'd get in touch with him when he was ready and to please not call in order to keep the line open for our children and family. One went so far as to try and \"just drop by\" twenty minutes after we got home. I rebuffed her, telling her that he'd contact her when he was better.\n\nHe's only this afternoon felt well enough to call a few friends back, and all of them complained to him I was some sort of enormous asshole for limiting contacts during his hospitalization. He told them I was protecting him, and that he was appreciative of me giving him space to start to heal from everyone. I've had to tell a few more today that he's still not ready for visitors and we're spending hours a day going back and forth to the hospital for him to get outpatient antibiotics ivs. Just got cussed out for being a killjoy and called an asshole.", "created_utc": 1670644170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhi1wv/aita_for_limiting_contact_after_surgery/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm just now to the point where I'm feeling better and able to do many of my normal things.  When I was in the hospital or had just had procedures done I often didn't feel like talking to anyone.  It was also stressful because we were waiting for 9 months for an infection to clear up enough to have surgery. It really stressed me out when family (well meaning and very lovingly) wanted to know what the next step was.  We often didn't know...we knew I needed surgery but just couldn't do anything at the time.  I had to have my mom be the one to talk about that stuff with family because it was too much for me.  I needed to focus on healing.\n\nYour husband didn't need to deal with all of that.  It's a caregivers job to run interference on possible guests and send them in their way if the patient isn't up to visitors or if the visit runs too long.
