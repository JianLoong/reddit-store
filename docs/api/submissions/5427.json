And to be frank, it\u2019s massive.\n\nSo we were watching the show, and this scene happens and we see it and I say. \u201cOh wow\u201d. That\u2019s it. Nothing gross, I want losing my mind over it. Just \u201coh wow\u201d.\n\nMy husband immediately stopped it and was upset with me. He told me that what I said was completely unnecessary and gross. I said I was sorry and that it was not a huge deal, I was just surprised I laughed it off kinda because I thought he was just being a little silly.\n\nHe was very upset and told me he no longer wanted to watch the show if I was gonna gawk at the guys junk. At this point I was annoyed as we were having a nice little night together and he was being dramatic about it. I told him that I wasn\u2019t gawking and that he had no reason to be this upset over some rubber dick in a tv show.\n\nThis line led to an even more ridiculous debate about the realness of the penis which I said I would look up to verify and he was not happy about that(because unfortunately it was in fact real).\n\nNow he\u2019s decided he doesn\u2019t want to watch the show with me. \n\nI have no idea why he\u2019s being this insecure about this, his penis is alright and I have no complaints about his size.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671762277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt41bb/aita_for_making_an_inappropriate_comment_while/", "score": 266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What have previous partners said? You need to take the focus off yourself and help him process. What really is in play here? \n\nFor example, my husband had a discussion with me where I explained how my mother reminded me often no man would find me attractive since my body was less than ideal. (No one is ideal!) Abusive mother. Not his or my fault. \n\nWe also discussed how he realized the American media distorts how women\u2019s bodies truly look. Not his or my fault.

GoT or HOTD for example.\n\nDid he make comments like 'oh wow' when a woman was naked on screen? If so, then hes just being a hypocrite.\n\nIf he *doesn't* do that, he probably feels like the level of respect he's giving you (not ogling women and making comments about them in front of his partner) isn't being matched by you.\n\nI'm not saying you are disrespecting him, just that he might *feel* that way.\n\nOn top of all that, there's a huge percentage of men who are insecure about their wangs since they were raised on a steady diet of porn from a very formative age. You unknowingly poked the bear on this one, but it doesn't make you an asshole.", "NTA I guess but I mean read the room... You complimented actor's junk because it was big and instead of validating his feelings a little you essentially called him ridiculous because he got insecure.

Your husband is sooooo insecure.", "HAHAHA I shouldn't laugh but I couldn't help it. Sorry.\nSo NTA - how fragile does your masculinity need to be upset over a guy's junk on TV? I haven't seen the series but remember when that scene was doing the rounds on SM, both my wife and I said the same thing - especially. When we read it was all natural.\nJust don't let him see \"that\" scene from Pam and Tommy - hubby will get upset his dick doesn't talk.\n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with anyone, regardless of sex and or sexuality, of being appreciative of another person's body (as long as you ain't creepy about it), if anything it shows a healthy level of maturity and trust in your partner.", "OP this really important, before you answer any other question I need to know. what episode down to minute and second.

It's pretty rare to actually be shocked by the bigness of breasts.", "How do you know that?", "Lol no they would not.", "This.

Should make it easier to remove the tube.", "Honestly I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised if OP said oh wow because there was a penis on screen regardless of size. Full frontal nudity and penises on the television is still pretty rare from my experience.", "Because he's the Designated AITA Gender-Reverse Idiot.  Didn't you know?

Not having any complaints is discreet and demure.", "I had a she-wee! But I never got to use it.\n\nI got one because I was pregnant and was supposed to go for a trip with my partner in his truck and do 6,100km and he didn\u2019t want to stop for me to pee constantly \ud83d\ude02 \n\nBut things got messed around with loads and I wouldn\u2019t have made it back in time to get back for work the following week.", "Honestly I think that guy might be the husband."]}
