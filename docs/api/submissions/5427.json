And to be frank, it\u2019s massive.\n\nSo we were watching the show, and this scene happens and we see it and I say. \u201cOh wow\u201d. That\u2019s it. Nothing gross, I want losing my mind over it. Just \u201coh wow\u201d.\n\nMy husband immediately stopped it and was upset with me. He told me that what I said was completely unnecessary and gross. I said I was sorry and that it was not a huge deal, I was just surprised I laughed it off kinda because I thought he was just being a little silly.\n\nHe was very upset and told me he no longer wanted to watch the show if I was gonna gawk at the guys junk. At this point I was annoyed as we were having a nice little night together and he was being dramatic about it. I told him that I wasn\u2019t gawking and that he had no reason to be this upset over some rubber dick in a tv show.\n\nThis line led to an even more ridiculous debate about the realness of the penis which I said I would look up to verify and he was not happy about that(because unfortunately it was in fact real).\n\nNow he\u2019s decided he doesn\u2019t want to watch the show with me. \n\nI have no idea why he\u2019s being this insecure about this, his penis is alright and I have no complaints about his size.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671762277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt41bb/aita_for_making_an_inappropriate_comment_while/", "score": 790, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What have previous partners said? You need to take the focus off yourself and help him process. What really is in play here? \n\nFor example, my husband had a discussion with me where I explained how my mother reminded me often no man would find me attractive since my body was less than ideal. (No one is ideal!) Abusive mother. Not his or my fault. \n\nWe also discussed how he realized the American media distorts how women\u2019s bodies truly look. Not his or my fault.

GoT or HOTD for example.\n\nDid he make comments like 'oh wow' when a woman was naked on screen? If so, then hes just being a hypocrite.\n\nIf he *doesn't* do that, he probably feels like the level of respect he's giving you (not ogling women and making comments about them in front of his partner) isn't being matched by you.\n\nI'm not saying you are disrespecting him, just that he might *feel* that way.\n\nOn top of all that, there's a huge percentage of men who are insecure about their wangs since they were raised on a steady diet of porn from a very formative age.

When we read it was all natural.\nJust don't let him see \"that\" scene from Pam and Tommy - hubby will get upset his dick doesn't talk.\n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with anyone, regardless of sex and or sexuality, of being appreciative of another person's body (as long as you ain't creepy about it), if anything it shows a healthy level of maturity and trust in your partner.", "OP this really important, before you answer any other question I need to know. what episode down to minute and second.

Gotta say the men's reactions were hilarious. \n\nNTA. Your man is showing some serious insecurities.", "I think that\u2019s a bit of an unfair comparison. The amount times I\u2019ve seen a pair of giant tits - or just any naked tits in a tv show or movie - is vastly more common than the times I\u2019ve seen penises in a show. I\u2019d sooner comment on a penis simply because it\u2019s really unexpected, whereas seeing boobs popping out of a shirt really isn\u2019t.", "Oh honey no.

Oh wait, Pixar. Nevermind.", "That\u2019s not what penis envy is. The concept literally only refers to girls. \n\nJust read freuds work before feeling like you have to introject baseless insults and misunderstandings.", "NTA but...every time from now on act like he did.

Then point out his ridiculous double standard.", "You dropped this \ud83d\udc51\n\nI sympathise with your husband, I dealt with pretty crippling insecurities, penis being one of them, for years. It was confusing and horrible.\n\nBut I was always quick to admit to myself that I was being an asshole and spent years working on my insecurities.\n\nIt's such a relief to not have this issue anymore, it makes me a better partner.\n\nCan't say there's a quick fix - he's got to admit to himself he's insecure, that the insecurity's irrational and big schlonged men are as allowed to exist as women who are draggin' wagons, and that he's being a thick, seven inch prick to you.

Just want to makensure I am accidentally not available then", "Beauvoir explained it as the girls coming to realize sexist oppression and the privileges that a penis affords to boys that is refused to girls.
