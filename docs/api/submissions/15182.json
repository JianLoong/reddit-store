Our son got a part time job as a lifeguard at a pool back in March (We live in South Florida, so the pools are open pretty much always). It was a good job for him, he liked it and was happy to have the money. The issue was his boss was an ass about giving time off.\n\nOur family takes a yearly vacation to this little beach house we rent for a year, we've done this since the year I was pregnant with my son. Of course the kids all love it and look foward to it. Well my son told his boss about the week when he signed up, but because that was only six weeks after he started there, he denied it.\n\nWe made it clear he was still going, it's just a part time job and there are a million of those. He protested, but we made him go, and his boss fired him. He was furious the entire time, he refused to do any family stuff or listen to us, so he was grounded when he got back.\n\nIt's not that we don't trust him to stay home alone or anything like that. We just don't want him to prioritize work over family, especially some weekend job. He found a job at another pool two weeks later, so it's not like this impacted him in any way, but he still holds a grudge about it. He claims we didn't respect his choices, and he's right, we don't respect him trying to choose his job over family time, though we don't hold it against him since he's just a teen.", "created_utc": 1681914828, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rv9gw/aita_for_making_my_son_quit_his_part_time_job_to/", "score": 842, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That sucks. You\u2019re still going\u201d? (Or, y\u2019 know, something to that effect.)", "YTA\n\nWhat do you think you've actually accomplished here? Your son was fired, made the vacation worse, didn't enjoy any of it, and has learned you don't respect him. How exactly is that valuing family? You should apologize if you hope to seem him after he graduates.", "YTA. Look, you forced him to go to vacation, causing his his job and income. Then you grounded him for being upset. Unless you offered to make up his income then I don\u2019t see how you were being fair. \n\nDid the kids love it or do you?", "YTA.\n\n\\*You made him lose his job\\*. He's 16. It's not like he's **prioritizing** work over vacation at 16. He is just starting to get started, and now he's got a job that **can't** be used for a recommendation.\n\nYou seem so blas\u00e9 about causing your son to lose his job. I'm glad that you don't \"hold it against him\", but he definitely has the right to hold it against you.", "YTA. Majorly.\n\nYour kid wanted to act repsonsible and you're actually teaching him lessons to put leisure before responsibility? Then, when he justifiably got mad that he lost his job because of YOUR actions, you decided he deserved even more punishment?\n\nNot only are you teaching your kid that a strong work-ethic isn't important, but you're also teaching him that his negative emotions aren't valid. He's angry at you because he's trying to become independent and you're actually holding him back in a very controlling manner. Are you trying to keep your little baby from growing up and becoming a man, momma?\n\nAllow your kid to grow up. You need to let go.", "YTA \n\nGuess what momma, you\u2019re not teaching him the things you should be teaching him.\n\nHe\u2019s not a little boy anymore and he had a commitment elsewhere. Then you punished him for being justifiably upset when he was fired.\n\nTsk tsk", "YTA. This didn\u2019t teach him to prioritize family and now you claim that because he has a different job that it didn\u2019t impact him in any way. Get a clue.", "YTA. \n\nLord help that boy whenever he finds a partner in life. You gonna order him to come home for holidays?", "My parents would do things like this. They thought my high school job was annoying because they were so used to controlling what I did. Sure I could make plans with friends, but if they decided as I was about to leave that they wanted me to go to a dinner party instead? I was going to the dinner party, didn\u2019t matter if people were counting on me.  They made me quit after 3 months because they were tired of me being able to say no because of work. \n\nYou know what I learned and I suspect your son learned also? It sucks, sucks, sucks to have parents that don\u2019t value your opinion or your commitments. It made me want to Get independent fast, even if it meant taking a less optimal career path. Because nothing was more important after being at the mercy of a parents\u2019 whims than getting some control back. YTA", "YTA 100% the asshole- he had a good part time job that he enjoyed and you made him give it up for your own selfish reasons. When you're starting out in the job field sometimes you have to prioritize work over family/social that's just the way the world works! It sounds like you couldn't deal with someone else giving your child directives and decided to power trip. You probably lost him a very good reference because he got fired, all because you're a controlling AH who doesn't respect their children's agency", "YTA- no you aren't teaching him that family comes first, you're teaching him that family forces him to do things and he gets punished for having feelings.   I also dont know many jobs that allow you to have enough PTO to take a week off after only being their 6 weeks. Nor did you teach how to handle this situation.  EMAIL any vacation requests so you can show it was asked for AND if it was knocked back. \n\nGood way to make sure your son wants to spend time away from family.  And if he was upset the whole week he sure did not enjoy being at the beach.", "YTA because you grounded him for daring to be upset about it", "YTA. Sounds like this was his first job, his first time having the responsibility and the income... being treated as an adult. Except you step in and take away his autonomy because family is more important? What you did was selfish and made no sense at all. Then you punished him... again!", "YTA\n\nHe made a commitment and you made him break that. This was a really shitty thing to do. Then punished him when he was understandably upset.", "YTA here, clearly. He had a job that he enjoyed and was willing to miss a vacation to keep that job. So you forced him to get fired because leisure should be put over work every time. In the real world, sometimes you have to go to work instead of doing what you want. \n\nAlso you live in south Florida and said in the comments it was a vacation to the beach. Can't say I blame him for not wanting to lose his job for a beach vacation when yall probably live within a couple hours, at most, from a beach.", "YTA only because you grounded him for being upset. In the future, he will be less inclined to expose his feelings to you.\n\nI'd say apologize for grounding him and instill in him the value and power he holds as an employee, that he's worth more than an unreasonable boss.", "YTA\n\nI get that you didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, but the job clearly meant a lot to your son, and you made him lose it. I had a similar situation at that age and I ended up getting fired for going on a family vacation (I wanted to go so I didn\u2019t care lol) but your son clearly really liked his job. Try to be more empathetic next time.", "I\u2019m going to go with YTA\n\nIt\u2019s clear your son was reluctant to go on the trip due to his work situation, and it showed. It seems he\u2019s trying to show responsibility by saying \u201cyeah, I have to work\u201d. Maybe he\u2019s trying to save up for something? I don\u2019t know. Nevertheless, you punished him for trying to be responsible. That\u2019s a problem.", "YTA.  He's 16, he gets to make his own decisions about his job.  Will you make him quit his full-time job when he's graduated college to join you on this vacation?\n\nTime to cut the apron strings before he rips them off himself.", "INFO: you gonna make your kids skip class in college for this trip too?", "Just asking, what is the point of the vacation when op's son didn't enjoy and got grounded?\n\noh and YTA", "YTA way to teach him to not honor his responsibilities and to not have a good work ethic.", "YTA He is 16 and and his opinions should matter. Why should it matter if he misses this trip? What happens when he gets a girlfriend or marries are you still going to try to control him He liked to responsibility of having that job. Be a better parent.", "YTA. You have to learn to flex as they get older. This is absurd.", "YTA.  You need to accept he is growing up (and apparently appropriately!) and will start his own life.    Keep this up and he will go away to college and go low contact.", "YTA\n\nAre you going to keep this up? You are teaching him to put his VACATION over his career and to be entitled about it.\n\nMy friend runs a good size tech company. He full-on does not even let his recruitment team pass along any CVs where they have moved jobs excessively. (Once a year for example unless it's they are unicorns.) \n\nFamily time is not this untouchable sacrosanct thing. Are you seriously saying you would expect your husband to make the same choice? That's hypocritical if you don't impose the same thing.\n\nFamily is that you get to live your life and grow and they are always there for you and support you.", "YTA - your son gets a job and shows maturity in wanting to fulfill his role despite being turned down... And you get him fired? Yeah, great example set there", "YTA - if you don't respect your son and let him make his own choices and allow him to express emotions, then he's just going to end up as another traumatized adult who wants nothing to do with their emotionally and mentally abusive parents.", "YTA about grounding him. \n\nI would use this as an opportunity to impart some adult lessons like his worth has an employee. I\u2019ve never started a job that told me my prior commitment is not going to be honoured. On your part OP, you have to respect that he\u2019s starting to grow away from your family unit and try & balance that with family activities.\n\nI\u2019m truly questioning everyone on here voting YTA for making him quit. He\u2019s 16 not 18. I wouldn\u2019t be leaving my 16 year old home alone while the rest of the family is gone on holiday. Nor would I be canceling said holiday which seems to be what everyone things OP should have done; losing the time off that has been booked, the beach house rental, any deposits on activities in the area just so the kid can keep working at a crappy P/T job. Personally I wouldn\u2019t want my child to work for a boss that can\u2019t respect his prior commitments & I would have stepped in when my kid came home from being hired to tell me his boss isn\u2019t going to give him the time off. Stepped in as in coached my child not talked to his boss.", "YTA. You say you want to put family first, but you couldn't put your son, your family member, over your vacation? Come on. Family first means having each others backs when it matters, not prioritizing leisure time.", "You grounded him?\n\nYep. YTA.", "YTA. Why is he grounded?! He is allowed to be upset that he lost his job!", "YTA. $5 says he's trying to save up money so he can move out the moment he turns 18.", "YTA. \n\nYou have a 16 year old son mature enough to get and keep a job, and who I assume you want to learn the values of respect and autonomy, and then you broke those very fundamental values multiple times. \n\nYour son now has no respect for you, because you lack basic respect for your child. \n\nFirst, you grounded him because of his feelings. You say over and over that it was because of how he \"acted\" but feelings are not just things in our brain, they manifest. If your partner cheats on you, according to your thinking, you can have \"feelings\" about it, but should not act on those feelings by getting a divorce? Your son was mad and disappointed, so he did not want to be around you, that is valid. \n\nSecond, you said you would pay him and then refused to do so. So now you are a liar. \n\nThird, your son made it clear he did not want to go on this vacation and would rather keep his job. You disregarded his feelings but then think he has no right to hurt your feelings. So your feelings about going on a vacation together are more important than his feelings, you can hurt his feelings and disrespect what he wants, but he cannot do the same to you? \n\nFinally, how did you see this playing out? A 16 year old who loves his job is forced to go on a vacation that will get him fired. Did you think he was going to be a joy to be around? How do you lack this much common sense? And then you punish him for YOUR choices?\n\nYou lack basic critical thinking skills, do not see your children as independent humans, you do not respect them, you do not respect their feelings, but expect them to absolutely cater to your wants and feelings. \n\nThat kid is gonna go off to college and never come home, and I wish him the absolute best.", "What a shitty parent\u2026 poor kid", ">We made it clear he was still going\n\n>we made him go\n\n>we don't trust him to stay home alone\n\n>We just don't want him to prioritize work over family\n\n>we don't respect him\n\nWhy is his life a series of \"We\"s? Where is his opinion in his life?\n\nYTA obviously", "YTA. \n\nI get that you didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, but the job clearly meant a lot to your son, and you made him lose it. I had a similar situation at that age and I ended up getting fired for going on a family vacation (I wanted to go on the trip and hated that job so I didn\u2019t care lol) but your son clearly really liked his job. Try to be more empathetic next time.", "YTA, especially since your son WANTED to work. If you trust him to watch the house, let him watch the house! Not only that, you grounded him when you got home after dragging him on a trip he DIDN\u2019T WANT TO GO ON! I mean, can you really be surprised he didn\u2019t want to do family activities with you guys if he didn\u2019t want to be there in the first place?\n\nI understand your side, and I think I understand what you\u2019re trying to do. My mother is super family oriented, she wanted to take me everywhere also. But there came a time for me, probably at about the same age as your son, where I didn\u2019t WANT to go on family vacations with her anymore. It doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love you or that he hates you, but he\u2019s becoming a young man and he\u2019s got his own shit going on. Have lunch with your son, have conversations with your son, show him you love him and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll show you he loves you too. To drag him along for a week, though? And then to punish him for not being happy about it? That\u2019s a surefire way to drive a wedge between you and your son. I\u2019m sure your intentions were good, but you\u2019re still TA.", "YTA: Teenagers don't always want to go on vacation with the family because they would rather stay with their friends or so. Your son had a job and wanted to be responsible. Why is that a bad thing? \n\nYes, it sucks he couldn't get the time off but you could have suggested was he puts off getting a job until after the vacation or find another job where they would be okay with the week off. There's no shortage of life guard jobs in South Florida.", "YTA - you forced him to go on a vacation he didn\u2019t want to go on and then you grounded him for it. Pick your battles.", "YTA - He is old enough to make his own decision on whether he wants to vacation or work. He has every right to be pissed.", "Yta. You shit on him then punished him for stinking.", "YTA. Goodluck getting him on the trip next year. Almost 18 so I guess you can't force him to do what you want much longer.", "YTA. How did that forced vacation work out for you?", "Face it, teenagers age out of wanting to hang around with their family. They start pushing themselves out of the nest, and it\u2019s a parent\u2019s job to help them do so safely. The son sounds like a thoughtful and responsible young man who should have been encouraged and supported in his choices. YTA.", "He didn't quit, you got him fired. Reading this story fully further supports my YTA ruling. Misleading people in the title is bad form, aside from the main issue.\n\n\nYour kid is 16. He is old enough to have autonomy. You absolutely disrespected him.", "YTA. You basically told him that what he wants doesn't matter to you. If I was him, I wouldn't have participated either. You punished him because he doesn't think like you. I see him pulling away from you since you are so controlling.", "YTA mandated fun. Do you happen to work in middle management?", "NTA. ...I am going against the grain here.  It is totally unrealistic for him to stay home alone at 16 for that long.  It was totally unrealistic of his boss to think at 16 he could tell his parents no he wasn't going.  As a parent I would not allow my teen to stay home that long or skip out on a vacation.  My parents would have never allowed me to stay home alone for that long.   I worked during summer during school and my parents required me to work it around their schedules.  I loved my summer jobs but it was for extra money and fun.\n\nPart time summer jobs for teens do not really count in the grand scheme of things for a job reference.   I mean it does look good they worked as a teen.  And if they get a reference that is great.  Most jobs a teenager is going to get is not looking at references.  Especially summer/short term work.  The whole cost him a reference thing is just laughable.  It is a SUMMER JOB.  When you are an adult they do not look at summer jobs for references.  Unless you were an intern in a job that you are trying to land.  No HR manager cares about a summer gig.   I am saying this as an HR manager.\n\nHis boss is T A.  He should have accommodated his  request.  He knew 6 weeks ahead of time. When he was hired he should have told him then.  Teens get bullied about working too much and having their time off requests accepted.  All it does is have them quit.  Managers are unrealistic thinking teens can not go on family vacations, etc.   They have to pretty much do what their parents say.  Summer jobs are just that- temporary. As a parent you have to do what is right for your child and the family as a whole.  It would have been unfair to everyone  else to cancel.\n\nIt is utterly ridiculous to mom shame her for doing the best for her family.  I would love to see the people who honestly would cancel a vacation for a summer gig for a teen. Literally no one.   You can certainly tell the ages of people saying she is T A.  They are acting like they cost him a real career.  So over the top! OP please do not take to heart what anyone is saying here.", "YTA but I think the part that makes you the biggest AH is that you grounded him for his reaction. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever okay to ground a child for having emotions about something, particularly when that thing is so understandable. And now you\u2019ve completely tainted this family vacation for your son, and family, so good job with that!", "YTA. Was this an agreement when he got the job that if he couldn\u2019t get the time off he would have to quit? Sounds like that wasn\u2019t discussed and expectations weren\u2019t clear because I agree you don\u2019t leave a 16 year old for a week. But to ground him? That\u2019s why YTA.", "YTA\n\nIronically, by forcing him to come along, you're also not prioritizing family. You're prioritizing yourself. I hope that this petty little power trip was worth it.", "It sounds like the problem will resolve itself within two years", "YTA. You completely invalidated his feelings and then punished him for it! He\u2019s freaking pissed! You only thought about yourself and what YOU wanted! You should check your ego and apologize or he\u2019s always going to resent you for this on some level.", "Shitty parents like you get cut off at 18. YTA do better.", "YTA-this isn\u2019t how you teach a kid to prioritize family over work.  This is how you teach a kid that work isn\u2019t a responsibility you have to take serious.  Having a job is a commitment.  Forcing your son to get fired instead of teaching him about compromise makes you TA here.  It wasn\u2019t \u2018just a job\u2019 it was a failed chance at a really valuable life lesson.", "YTA, you've taught him the family is oppressive, well done.", "Has anyone mentioned the OP is controlling?", "Imagine having a teen who not only was willing to get a part time job but also understood the responsibility and commitment of taking on a job and then punishing them for it.\n\nYou're the asshole, OP and I suggest you stop parenting based on emotion if you care about raising healthy, well-adjusted kids.", "YTA.  What are you teaching your son about work?  That vacation or whatever happens to come up in his world is more important than his job.  I work with teens and college age kids and that is the biggest problem I have with them.  When something better comes up they don't want to come in.  He is being a responsible kid by saying I have to work and you are telling him his job responsibilities are less important than ***vacation***.  Claiming it's about family   \ntime is really an excuse because that's not what it's about.  What's going to happen once he is an adult and decides going to the beach house for a week is more important than his job because that's what you are teaching him.  Is that really the lesson you want him to learn?", "So you ruined your own vacation on purpose and punished someone for being mad that you got them fired on purpose. Yeah YTA and you're also not very bright if you didn't see that coming. I'd be mad at you too. He's going to remember this one forever and your vacation home is now a tainted memory because you can't stop being controlling one time.", "YTA - So what happens next year when it\u2019s an internship for his preferred college major?  Do you make him quit to go on your vacation?  \n\nIt\u2019s called responsibility - he took a job, and he should see it through.  Making him quit because you want him to go on family vacation is selfish.  You do know that kids grow up and they need to have their choices respected? \n\nTime for the baby bird to fly, Mom.  Let him.  There will be more vacations, but remember you no longer dictate his schedule.", "Wow. You've got a legit shot at Terrible Parent of the Year. Bad job!", "**YTA** \\- he is alleged to be your, '**Son**', not your **possession**!  He had a job he enjoyed, and you **manipulated** him causing him to be fired.  You don't know if or for how long it could follow him.   'He holds a grudge!'  No big shock there, you **do not** respect him or his choices.  He has every right in the world to hold a grudge against you, and disrespect you for what you did to him.", "YTA, Holy crap.\n\nYou should have made it his choice, you are punishing him for being mad after you forced him to get fired.... punishing him for your actions.\n\nNow, antiwork may complain here, but, you are teaching him that vacation is more important than work ethic and commitment.  He committed to the job, agreed to the no vacation in first few months rule (a lot of companies have that, its normal) and then you made him break his commitment, making him break his word.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou didnt respect his commitment he made when he got the job.

Our son got a part time job as a lifeguard at a pool back in March (We live in South Florida, so the pools are open pretty much always). It was a good job for him, he liked it and was happy to have the money. The issue was his boss was an ass about giving time off.\n\nOur family takes a yearly vacation to this little beach house we rent for a year, we've done this since the year I was pregnant with my son. Of course the kids all love it and look foward to it. Well my son told his boss about the week when he signed up, but because that was only six weeks after he started there, he denied it.\n\nWe made it clear he was still going, it's just a part time job and there are a million of those. He protested, but we made him go, and his boss fired him. He was furious the entire time, he refused to do any family stuff or listen to us, so he was grounded when he got back.\n\nIt's not that we don't trust him to stay home alone or anything like that. We just don't want him to prioritize work over family, especially some weekend job. He found a job at another pool two weeks later, so it's not like this impacted him in any way, but he still holds a grudge about it. He claims we didn't respect his choices, and he's right, we don't respect him trying to choose his job over family time, though we don't hold it against him since he's just a teen.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sometimes when you lose one job it takes a long time to find another. Financial security is important.", "For you it was just a part time job that you probably will forgot.For him, he will always remember as his parents not respecting him and thinking they are above him.

If you're ok with him being home alone, respecting his wish to sit this one out would have been ok. \n\n\n At the same time, I see your point about not sacrificing memories and moments like that vacation for something that is temporary.  Time is finite and prescious after all, and you guys will never have more time and flexibility to spend together than now/ before they fly the coop and start their own lives. \n\nGrounding him was the absolute wrong call though. A talking to and explanation as to why you wanted him with you guys would have been better.

You didn't teach your kid anything about prioritizing his responsibilities between family and work other than that his parents will prioritize themselves and their beliefs of what are important, more than his self determination and what he values.

Then you went back on your promise to pay him the lost wages--aka lying and then grounded him.  \n\nBut at least you have those great \"happy family memories\" LOL.", "YTA and super disrespectful to your kid. He had a responsibility and you disrespected it. He took the time to get a job he liked and you crapped all over him for your selfish family time. Your 16 doesn\u2019t care.

We just don't want him to prioritize work over family, especially some weekend job. \n\nYour logic is wrong.  The issue is not your son prioritizing work over family.\n\nThe BIG HUGE ISSUE is that his boss was disrespectful towards your son's plans.  Your son was made to feel like he isn't allowed vacation time (when he is ABSOLUTELY permitted to take time off).  This shouldn't be something he should even question.  No one should be \\*trained\\* at the age of 16 to put work first, always and blindly.  This is a BAD EMPLOYER.\n\nYou made it work vs family. It is really work vs. self. (And, by extension, you showed him family also doesn't care about \"self\" b/c he got fired, which is something that feels shitty no matter how dumb or insignificant the job).  Those are the sort of deep wounds that are hard to unlearn.", "Nta and here why if he had stayed home someone would have to stay with him cuz the 16-year-old cannot stay for week s at a time by themselves I mean everyone would have to forfeit their vacation op  is right it is just a part-time job he can find another one", "NTA - His boss was inflexible.  You are trying to teach your son there are more important things than a job.  Also that to a job you aren't valued and are replaceable.  You made the right choice for the family.  You just didn't take the time to explain it to your son in a way he understood.\n\nHe's probably on reddit - ask him to head over to r/antiwork so he can see just how replaceable and undervalued good workers are.\n\nIf it's about the money - you and your husband could 'backfill' the pay he missed out on.  You can point out he was able to get a job two weeks later.  A boss that won't give you time off for a family event that was talked about during the hiring process is a boss who won't give you a good reference anyway.\n\n>You're admitting to him that he's right, we don't respect him trying to choose his job over family time\n\nIf he is still holding a grudge that is a different conversation.  He cut of his nose to spite his face by refusing to have fun with the family as if he hurt anyone but himself.  Instead of punishing him by grounding him when you got back there should have been more of a conversation.  He's already punished himself enough.  Grounding is just going to set his resentment and anger into concrete.  Go talk to your son.  Encourage open communication.", "So going against the grain from what I see but NAH. It is fair that he is upset but he also needs to recognize that family is more important then that job. This is time he will never get back for a job that will replace him immediately. The people who bend the knee at the alter of capitalism will say his job is important, blah blah blah but the reality is he's a kid and a kid should be allowed to be 1 because the 1 thing about working is once you start you will never stop but he will stop being a kid, these lake trips may end and he will have missed out on importantfamily moments. As a parent I would say you should apologize to your son for the way this went down but explain why you made the choice you did, give examples of how in you do this in your own life and career. Your son is 16 he will understand, he may not appreciate it today but in the future if he has his own family his children and partner will appreciate having him put them before his work.", "Yta huge controlling ah", "YTA", "NTA. His boss is the TAH. It\u2019s a part time job filled by a teenager who told him about it from the beginning. He should have given him the time off. You\u2019re right to teach him early that no job is worth prioritizing your family.", "NTA", "NTA. He has his whole life to work. He doesn't have his whole life to go on vacation with his whole family. Those times are fleeting, so I don't see any issue with making the most of them.", "NTA.  It\u2019s a BS job at 16.  There\u2019s plenty other \u201cjobs\u201d he will have before his career.", "Seems like this is going quite contrary to everyone else, but NTA/NAH. This yearly trip is a family tradition to spend some good time together. The job is entry level, part-time, and temporary. A trivial job that only offers some cash. It isn't like it's an internship or a first job at a company he wants to work at and climb the ladder. \n\nThe boss is probably being an ass about it (at least in your perspective) because he has to deal with flaky teens all the time. Still, I would have thought he'd begrudgingly give him the time off, having put some time into training your son, rather than firing him. Especially since the vacation was brought up at the time of hire. I experienced something similar when I was a teen: got hired at a movie theater, told them about a summer vacation that would happen a few months later, they said, \"no problem\" but scheduled me for those days anyway. They were even upset I had found someone to cover for me. \n\nYou put your son in an uncomfortable position though. Getting fired is not a fun experience, and doesn't set a good tone for the trip. I think he's justified in being upset.\n\nBut in the big scheme of things, being upset about losing a 6wk old lifeguarding job to go on vacation with your family is silly. Especially since he got a new one a couple weeks later.", "NTA imo because he will be working his whole life so he should be enjoying family vacations and being a teenager as long as he can.", "nta, he's 16 and still a child.  you do what you think is right for him, even if he gets mad about it.  and you're right, it's just part time job, who gives a shit lol.  i'm surprised he did and wasn't just like \"ok, i quit\" when they wouldn't give him time off.", "NTA. You made it clear that he was expected to go on the trip with you.  He could have quit the job at any time prior to the vacation and got another who would have allowed him the time off.  He chose not too.  He learned that bosses don\u2019t play when they say you can\u2019t have the time off. But you, as his mother, have every right to tell him when he is to participate in family functions.  \n\nHe is still a minor. And the repercussions of his actions are his consequences.", "NTA. theres other jobs and he requested it well in advance", "Torn on this one but leaning towards NTA. This is something important to you as a family and he was upfront with his boss far in advance.

Did you actually expect him to be happy on this trip you forced him to take?

I hate the phrase \"respect your elders\". No. If you are going to be an asshole you don't deserve it.

But even if that was the case (which it wasn\u2019t) you punished him for being upset about being forced to lose his job?

You\u2019re just crushing this parenting thing, aren\u2019t you??", "You've gave him a great example of disrespecting people, so is it a surprise he's mirroring it back", "So you punished him for not wanting to play happy family and actually having emotions about losing his job thanks to you. He didn\u2019t want to be there and I don\u2019t blame him. You sound far too over bearing and don\u2019t respect him. Didn\u2019t respect he had a job important to him, didn\u2019t respect him enough to listen to his feelings, didn\u2019t respect him enough to let him even have feelings apparently. Let me ask, if you were forced to give up something important to you for something you then had that pushed in your face how would you feel? Im guessing you wouldn\u2019t be putting on the happy face to be drug around all day.", "Yup that\u2019s correct! My point is that I don\u2019t think the boss was an AH for denying the vacation request.", "Because I was 16. And 16 year olds are stupid. 16 year olds that suddenly find themselves with zero supervision are highly likely to do something really fucking dumb. Now if this was an overnight type thing then yeah, leave him & he\u2019ll most likely be fine & not too stupid. But a week? Not a chance.", "Have you seen movies? Because real kids throw parties too and do all kinds of their parents aren't home they're just too young to stay for days at a time without any supervision", "The part where he is 16. And 16 year olds can be fucking super irresponsible and just plain stupid! Him being a lifeguard has nothing to do with it cause at work he is being supervised by adults. \n\nAnd IMO, the first time he\u2019s left alone shouldn\u2019t be for a week. Start at an overnight so he can a) prove he can be responsible & b) so he can get used to it.", "You can either eat this turd sandwich or drink this piss tea. Not really a \"choice\" there, is it? Don't act like being told \"put this job above your previously scheduled plans or be fired\" is really a choice.", "I do find it weird that a family is willing to leave a 16-yo home alone for a week, tbh, and whether the options are \"you are going b/c we paid months ago\", \"you are going b/c you can't be home alone, and need to stay w/ a grandparent\" etc, I do think \"family time is important\" is not the real reason here. \n\nEither way, I do feel like there is some major life lessons that are being incorrectly addressed here.\n\nYou DO need to tell your employer, upon hiring, that you have a vacation planned 6 weeks later and get it cleared. An employer DOES have to be ok w/ work-life balance (especially in a p/t lifeguard job)...\n\nLike, all of that is the important and now the kid seems to believe \"If I don't do what my boss says & requires me to forego a vacation, I will get fired\" which is a TERRIBLE message for someone to have imprinted on them in their FIRST job in the FIRST 6 weeks of work.", "And will make him quit summer classes in college to go.", "First comment with any common sense on here. I'm in my thirties, you think I include any fucking job I've worked as a teenager? I still think OPs an AH but her son's career choices aren't being affected at all here. She even says he already got a new job as a lifeguard.", "youre getting way to heated", "It will do jack shit when you're 16 and the only job experience you have is one that you quit after just a couple of weeks.   \n\n\nSure, in the long run it absolutely doesn't matter. And I'm all for encouraging kids to prioritize their own happiness over a job. But THEIR OWN HAPPINESS is not what was prioritized here.", "Still, almost naked.

Where do you live? If you put someone down as a reference and they give you a bad one then hey, most likely (some exceptions ofc) you were crap at your other job. Why is it illegal for the bloke to be honest?", "Out of curiosity where do you live if you don\u2019t mind sharing? My country\u2019s labour laws are a million times better/more protective of workers than the US but it\u2019s not illegal to give a bad reference here as far as I know.", "It's not illegal to give a negative reference in the States as long as it's truthful. \n\nNow, many companies don't want to deal with the headache that a negative reference can bring, so they may simply decline to provide anything beyond confirming dates and titles", "On the offchance you're in the UK, this is not true but is a common misconception. It is illegal to give a false reference, not a bad reference. If the person left early every Wednesday and you say they left early every Wednesday that's perfectly legal because it's true.", "\"Why is no one having a good time? I specifically requested it.\"", ">The grounding will continue until morale improves.", "Why does she keep insisting the \u201ckids love it\u201d when clearly - based on what OP herself is saying- the 16 does not??", "Funny that OP is in FL - you see this type of AH behaviour in Disney allllll the time. Parents bellowing at their crying kids that \"they better have fun goddamnit, DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I PAID FOR THIS?!\"", "His beach/pool job don\u2019t forget!", "That's what I was thinking. Me and my wife also live in south Florida. We have spent countless hours at the beach already. We refuse to go on \"vacation\" to a beach. We can drive 10 minutes and be at the beach. We want to to see rain forests and jungles and stuff we don't see every day.", ">\tthe woman\n\nThe **parents.** There are two of them.", ">Nah, you taught him family will put themselves before him\n\nTHIS!!! This is the best take I've seen yet. For OP, it seems like the definition of \"family\" is her way or the highway.", "Can you imagine OP as a grandparent? Ohhhh the DEMANDS she will make to her grandkids - \"AREN'T WE HAVING FUN, Y'ALL?!!!\"", "No, he definitely was. He was informed at hiring. If he didn't like that he should have made it clear at that time. \n\nAnd if your 16 year old employee taking a week off causing significant buissiness issues, your buissiness is run like shit.\n\nThat said, the parents are also assholes as it should have been the kid that decided for themselves how to handle the situation.", "If you regularly understaff to the point it's a major inconvenience for someone to take a week off, then you're probably not a great person.  \nWhenever I've been in charge of recruitment I would ask a new person to tell me about any upcoming commitments and these would be booked no questions asked as soon as they started. I'm guessing a 16yo might not have known to do that though.", "If you say, going into a job, that you have leave needs 6 weeks later and they hire you anyway, that's on the employer to fix.", "He mentioned it when hired. The boss is absolutely an AH", "The boss is 100% an AH for denying a vacation request SIX WEEKS OUT", "There is a lot of difference in maturity among teenagers. Some 16 year olds are stupid, but a lot of them are actually responsible and trustworthy. My parents would leave for weeks long vacations and leave my sister and I behind all alone since we were 14 years old. We never missed a day of school, had guests over without checking with our parents first or consumed illegal substances. I know some 14 years old that I would trust not to kill themselves being alone for some days. But some others, not so much.", "lol When I was 16 I was taking a 3hr train ride to another country AND THEN informing my parents that Id be back in a week.\n\nAnd amazingly I didnt start doing any really fucking dumb stuff until my mid-20s.", "OP specifically said they\u2019d be fine with him being home alone.", "Did you know not every teenager is a character from a movie?\n\nHe\u2019s like 18 months from being an adult, he\u2019s gonna have to be left alone at some point", "Movies aren't real, also a teenager responsible enough to be a life guard is responsible enough to stay home alone", "Not every sixteen year old is a party animal. In fact most aren\u2019t. Many sixteen year olds are definitely mature enough to spend a week at home alone. In fact it\u2019s not an unusual occurrence. OP said that trust was not the issue. If they trust him to stay home, why couldn\u2019t he?", "That's not true. Some kids aren't responsible, yes, but this kid is clearly doing fine.", "The choice was his make not for parents to take away. He could have gone on vacation and disregarded his job. That's still a choice and he made it and parents ignored it.\n\nIn your setup, it'll be son settled on turd sandwich but parent force fed him the piss.\n\nI question you again, what if son just said no he didn't want to go even if he didn't a job but they still force him to go on vacation. Would parents still n.t.a. to you?", "Exactly, hell, I don't have jobs I worked in college on my resume anymore, it's just not relevant at all. Most people tailor their resumes for different jobs anyways. OP's an asshole because she handled this poorly, but I actually don't think she's wrong to insist he went on the family vacation. She should have had a conversation with him about why getting fired from this job wasn't the end of the world and frankly about not being taken advantage of in the workplace.", "Entitlement to what? Time off from work? Ill admit Im older, but if I put in for time off, which is part of my compensation, I am not ASKING to be off, I'm telling you I won't be here, and its the managers job to find coverage. I feel like thats a good lesson, here delivered very very badly.", "Personally, I think this is a stretch. \n\nI have taught my kids to work hard, to hold their commitments, etc etc. But if 6 weeks notice isnt enough for the boss, thats not a place I would want my kid (or myself) to work.  Actually ran into a somewhat similar situation with my own 16 year old. She needed time off for a school related thing an the boss gave her a bit of a hassle and I told my kid to quit if the boss wouldnt approve the time off not because my kid is entitled to whatever she wants in life but because she is a child and I do not think jobs should be at the top of a kids priority list.", "Illegal in the sense that it\u2019s considered defamation. I was not specific enough, my bad.", "I specifically demanded it.", "Thank you lol", "Unexpected b99!", "LOLOL!  Thanks for the laugh.... I will have to try working this into a family jest someday....", "Haaaaaa!", "This vacation makes as much sense as going to your neighbors pool to swim because it's not the pool in your own backyard.", "Thats neat but op clearly said \"me\" when the son told her to fuck off in the comment I was replying to.", "And if they don\u2019t pretend she\u2019ll be like \u201cyou need to teach your children respect.

Too many people have been conditioned to accept being taken advantage of by employers and they think other people should be too.", "Honestly, he didnt want to go to family vacation and he should be allowed to do his choice. Family didnt give  jack shit about what he wanted and blatantly disrespected his choice. No wonder he is resented lol.\n\nIf they cared, they would make the effort to be emotionally vulnerable to show how much they wanted his presence and how happy they would be if they came, and show some sadness in case he didnt and let him make his choice.", "I assume you\u2019re not located in the U.S.  Is that correct?  Here, there is no state where the law prohibits anyone from providing a poor reference, as long as they aren\u2019t making untrue statements.", "It's not *illegal* to give a bad reference, per se, it's *legally risky* in case the ex-employee decided to make a deal out of it.   \n\n\nMy company asks us not to provide references at all because of that concern but I am always happy to personally put in the good word for a great past employee and certainly know how to phrase a response about a bad employee that's ambiguous on its face but clear to a hiring manager what I mean.", "It's not defamation if what they said is true.

Chances are he worked even less than 5 days a week and 4 hours a day, as it's a part time lifeguard job. He likely wasn't even past his probationary period. I don't believe your work history. Any boss in the world would fire you for that. A family vacation is a laughable emergency.", "What planet are you from that 6 weeks is less than 30 days? Stop boot licking these shitty employers."]}
