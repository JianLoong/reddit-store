It was an honest oversight and a quick conversation saying, hey my card was accidently used for other people's orders, should resolve everything nicely. Or;\n\n2. It's blatant theft and disrespect to you as a person, and he or she needs to be reported to your manager/supervisor and ordered to pay you back the money immediately. \n\nI'd start with one and then move to, two, the amount of money is irrelevant it is categorical theft if it was intentional and theft even if it was an accident if not paid back quickly.", "NTA assume it\u2019s an honest mistake and ask for your money back - $30 is a lot for people on low incomes.

That's literally stealing.", "NTA. Maybe bring it up with the others in the group, but more because you are worried it happened, and maybe it has happened to others before.

They made me feel like the ahole cause I asked for my change.. my change was used for someone else\u2019s sandwich. \n\nI don\u2019t ever buy anyone things or  ask for things when someone is making a run because of this one incident 10+ years ago.", "So. Much.

That's theft. The person who used your card owes you for the charges you didn't make.\n\nBetter strategy is to order your own lunch now you've found out that your coworker is untrustworthy.\n\nThe only person you need to talk to is the coworker who stole money from you, fraudulently charging 2 additional meals on your card. He's the one responsible, not the ones who ate the food.", "NTA \n\nI would have never given my card to anyone. And i certainly wouldnt want to be the one responsible for holding onto and using everyone elses bank cards. For this exact reason.  Why didn't you all just Venmo/cashapp/Zelle the money to the one who was getting the food. These apps have been around for a decade or more by this point. \n\nI mean i would want my money back too.  But is the hassle really worth it or is this a lesson learned. That is definitely something you have to decide.", "NTA, and this is a cheap lesson in *never* lend anyone your card. \n\nYou never know when someone will decide to boop themselves some free groceries or photograph your card for future use. I've known people to run lunch runs to scam people out of change. So even if it goes fine the first couple of times, there's a huge potential of loss by allowing them to go with your card and the bank may refuse to cover you if they found you allowed unauthorized use of your card. \n\nSo I'd stop doing this. It's unfortunately likely to end badly. Deffo think there is a chance they did steal from you thinking the new guy won't rock the boat. Could be innocent, could be deliberate, but I wouldn't give them more money than you can afford to lose in future.", "more like \"WIBTA for trying to resolve an issue regarding the money one of my group technically stealing money from me?\"\n\ndid they exactly got your permission to just spend extra from YOUR card like that?\n\neven if you're in a perfect world with pockets so deep that this would sound like no big deal at all, NTA because the card wasn't theirs to begin with", "YWNBTA and you do not have to go to everyone in the group, only the person who charged the two extra meals on your card.

If they had all the cards present the card reader may have pinged your card in error if it was in range still. \n\nLesson to be learnt; pay online and get colleague to collect only.", "I would personally dispute the charge with my bank and get a new card.

This is absurd that they are handing over their cards to a stranger. The only person I give my card to is my husband. They need to find a better system\u2026things like Venmo/Twint/Wise or whatever that country uses. Or cash.", "This. Speak up. I doubt anyone will stiff op over this, they were planning on paying anyway. Also, they all work together so it\u2019s not like they can\u2019t be held accountable", "Everyone's name is on the card.

Even the servers now have to put the machine on the table so you can tap it or insert it. ***They*** don't take it off somewhere else to do that.\n\nIf the restaurant is capable of splitting the costs then they can do it at the table. There is absolutely NO reason for somebody who isn't the cardholder to take other people's cards. Very bizarre.\n\nBTW make the server or shop assistant do it in front of you and preferably DON'T hand over the card. My card got cloned some years ago when a shop assistant briefly turned around (that's literally all that happened) and presumably they had one of those readers (behind them) to swish the card over to capture the details for a cloned card later. Even beware of a server who \"drops\" the card and picks it up as I've read about the dishonest taping a reader to their leg under their trousers & \"accidentally\" running it past that reader as they straighten up.\n\nOP: do a careful check on 'your' purchases or debits from your account for a couple of months - I have never known people take ***other*** peoples cards to pay.", "It was probably just an accident", "Right? Would not be surprised if some time from now (to throw off suspicion) OP gets mysterious charges from online purchases. \n\nOP you need to cancel that card now and get a new one.", "It was almost certainly not fraud. They handed a bunch of credit cards to one coworker and had him pay for probably at least 5 different orders. It\u2019s very likely a mistake was made. It would be stupid for him to \u201ccommit fraud\u201d for one lunch, against a coworker who could easily take action against him in the company. They just need to figure out who didn\u2019t get charged and they can Venmo op", "OP was charged for 3 lunches. If each card was to be charged for one lunch, 2 cards were missing. \n\nIt's up to person who did the transactions to repay OP as he made the \"mistake\" if it was a mistake and he can collect from the other party.", "So two people owe OP like $10. They could just give him cash or Venmo him directly. It really shouldn\u2019t be that hard to figure out op just needs to speak up"]}
