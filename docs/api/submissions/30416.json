It was an honest oversight and a quick conversation saying, hey my card was accidently used for other people's orders, should resolve everything nicely. Or;\n\n2. It's blatant theft and disrespect to you as a person, and he or she needs to be reported to your manager/supervisor and ordered to pay you back the money immediately. \n\nI'd start with one and then move to, two, the amount of money is irrelevant it is categorical theft if it was intentional and theft even if it was an accident if not paid back quickly.", "NTA assume it\u2019s an honest mistake and ask for your money back - $30 is a lot for people on low incomes.

That's literally stealing.", "NTA. Maybe bring it up with the others in the group, but more because you are worried it happened, and maybe it has happened to others before. Try to find out if this was an honest mistake or if the coworker is often over charging the cards.", "NTA Absolutely ask for the money back. However don't assume someone committed fraud. Using multiple cards for one order can get confusing, and someone may have simply made a mistake.", "What a sketchy system. I would never give my cc to a work colleague.
