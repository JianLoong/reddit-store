There was no way to keep the truth from me since my parents had been married and the age gap between my half sister and me. I think my dad and stepmom (or mistress as I think of her) are shitty people. I'm almost 18 and entering my senior year of high school.\n\nThis guy posted in a private Facebook group I'm part of, a local one that is like a general ask questions and agony aunt kinda thing, and said he was married and his wife just found out she was pregnant and he was tempted to cheat with this other woman and wanted to know if the idea was a bad one or I guess why he should resist. People were commenting and he was responding. So I spilled all the sordid info on my family and I told him he runs the risk of his kid thinking of him as a piece of shit, of him having kids with both women and creating a mess where a family is never truly formed and since others were already saying it that he would destroy his wife and break his family before his child is even out in the world. He was really interested in my answer and asked a bunch of questions which I answered. I was fully honest and held nothing back.\n\nApparently someone in my dad's family was in the group and saw the post and my comments. They shared with my dad and his mistress and they went off on me. My dad said that is the kind of thing you don't share with the internet while his mistress asked if I enjoyed publicly shaming them. I told her if she thought it was so wrong she never should have been a mistress. Dad said that wasn't the point and I told him he was the one who decided to cheat on his pregnant wife. He asked if all the years they have stayed together meant nothing to me and I said yeah, it doesn't change what he did, it doesn't take away the fact he made me come into the world in one of the messiest ways and he complains about the stuff he missed out on with me but he made choices and those had consequences.\n\nThey said no matter how I felt I never should have shared such personal information online.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693152177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162ua5b/aita_for_spilling_sordid_family_information_on/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
