People were commenting and he was responding. So I spilled all the sordid info on my family and I told him he runs the risk of his kid thinking of him as a piece of shit, of him having kids with both women and creating a mess where a family is never truly formed and since others were already saying it that he would destroy his wife and break his family before his child is even out in the world.
