He\u2019s a cute kid, I love my nephew, but he\u2019s a very curious kid.\n\nThis week, I got a call from my sister in a panic telling me that her garage was on fire and the fire dept was trying to put out a blaze on her car.\n\nI got over there as soon as I could and by the time I was there it was almost all out. The garage was burnt out, so was her car and some wooden pallets on the ground.\n\nWhen I got a chance to talk to my sister she was shaken up but okay. I asked her how it happened and she told me my nephew started it. He told her he was playing around with the lighter and some cardboard in the garage and thought he put it out, but clearly hadn\u2019t put it out correctly so he didn\u2019t notice it spreading as he went to go do something else. A couple more minutes had passed and my nephew went back in the garage, noticed the fire and called for my sister.\n\nWhen she told me this I honestly could not believe it. She was writing it off as an accident and trying to shrug it off but I kept pushing her on it.\n\nWhy was the lighter out for him to reach? How did he know how to even use the lighter? (I honestly don\u2019t think I could use one properly until I was 11) Where was she while he was alone in the garage?\n\nShe didn\u2019t like this line of questioning and told me to knock it off. I didn\u2019t want to give her the third degree (no pun intended) after she and her family were shaken up like this but I didn\u2019t like her calling it an accident.\n\nI told her that while my nephew had some blame in this because he started the fire, she also was to blame because she left the lighter unsecured in a place where he could reach it. She called me ridiculous and asked me if I could really expect her to lock up lighters in her home just because of her six year old.\n\nI said yes, I could. I have a two year old and keep a locked cabinet for fire starters and chemicals, and I make sure the knife drawer is child proofed. (I got a little paranoid about these things after she started to walk)\n\nMy sister started cursing me out and demanded I leave and informed me she reprimanded her son but wasn\u2019t going to punish him and that I was out of line for suggesting it was anyone\u2019s fault.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to press my sister on details since she\u2019s now calmed down since the fire, but she won\u2019t give me many. Just the vague \u201cI stepped away for a second and this happened\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that some of the fire damage spread to her neighbor\u2019s property. It wasn\u2019t extensive, but the fire did encroach on their property. If the fire dept hadn\u2019t come sooner, it would\u2019ve burned down both my sister and her neighbor\u2019s houses.\n\nIdk, I\u2019m wondering if I was wrong and should just let this go.

Your sister was simply negligent for not only allowing him to get a hold of a lighter but allowing him to play in the garage unsupervised.", "NTA - she was neglectful and yes, you have to do things like lock up matches and lighters and knives and anything that could harm the child or others. It\u2019s just common sense", "I was 10 when 2 of my brother's 9 and 6 and they snuck one of my fathers lighters and started a fire in the closet. They hollered and I heard them and put it out.  \n\nKids do stupid things. Parents do need to be aware and talk to their kids but some kids are quite adapt at making mischief and it sounds like he is one of them.  It was an accident.  She probably is already well aware of what could have been and pretty panic about it. \n\nPart of me is thinks you are an AH but half of me thinks she is too.  But at the same time u are both right too.  She needs to put more energy into keeping him out of mischief and you need to realize she already knows this, huge wake up call will hopefully change things.  But it was an accident.", "ESH\n\nYou suck for doing this literally right after the fire happened, there is a time and place to talk about something like this, doing it while your sister is still freaking out over a fire in her house is not the time. Your sister is the asshole for not keeping things like lighters out of reach or locked up in a fashion to where it is safe for her 6 year old. You were right in that she caused the danger both her her family and her neighbors, but you could have waited for her to have at least a little bit of time to calm down after her family was in danger.", "ESH - you\u2019re right, your sister should be locking up things that start fires, such as lighters. They shouldn\u2019t be anywhere within reach of a child. That being said, there\u2019s a time and a place for everything and this was 100% NOT the time.", "ESH. The timing wasn't right, but the concern behind it is not misplaced. Playing with fire can be, but isn't always, a sign of mental health issues. No one wants to think their child may be dangerous.

He needs to be evaluated STAT.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "YTA. Seriously that was the time to interrogate your sister and blame her? Sometimes shit happens with little kids, they do stupid stuff. Doesn't make it not an accident. He's six. Six year olds do stupid stuff all the time no matter what the parents do. This time, that stupid stuff bit them on the ass, and their house nearly burnt down because of it. It was neither time nor the place for your third degree.", "NTA. however it\u2019s a stressful time for her and understandably not what she wants to hear atm with everything she has on her mind right now. but I do agree with you, she should absolutely keep lighters out of reach of little hands. as a kid it\u2019s not hard to use a lighter when you watch adults use them on the daily. I have memories of still being in a cot yet I don\u2019t remember ever being unable to work a lighter. I used to start fires in the garden using just a magnifying glass. thankfully I never let it get out of control, though. kids need to be under constant supervision tbh they will always find a way", "YTA, Not the time and place to shift blame as she's processing her loss. Also I am 99% sure I saw this aftermath on TikTok.", "ESH. Does your sister need to be more responsible and child proof her home? Yes.\n\nHowever time and place exist. You should have waited till a few days for everything to calm down and then sat her down for a serious talk.", "YTA. She had a traumatic event and you're harassing her about her parenting. She could have died. Her son could have died. House fires are no joke. She has a lot on her plate dealing with insurance and replacing lost items. The last thing she needs is you coming down on her about fault. It helps no one.", "You did this while the garage was still smoldering and the crisis was ongoing? YTA that was not the time to bring it up. She was in the middle of an emergency, facing a burned down garage, car damaged, damage to the neighbor\u2019s house and you are there berating her and pointing fingers? How was that at all helpful to the situation? What good did it do to go after her like that in that moment? Were you afraid if you waited to talk to her about safety even one day more your nephew would run into the house, find another unsecured lighter and then burn down the rest of the building?\n\nImportant message, yes, but shitty timing.", "ESH, not the place or time for those kinds of questions. Your sister knows she screwed up, no need to add insult to injury", "NTA. She\u2019s being heavily irresponsible and is lucky it didn\u2019t went any farther than it did.", "Nta, I think I saw this story from your sisters page on tik tok(came across my fyp. Very similar story.) lighters should never be in reach of children and he shouldn\u2019t have been left unattended outside. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just because I my dad was a fire fighter, but I was taught as soon as I could understand that lighters and matches were very dangerous and I was never allowed to touch them.", "NTA - this could have ended much much worse and if she doesn't recognize that this is a problem then it very well could happen again.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is irresponsible.", "My parents always told me not to play with fire.

Most 6 year olds don't do that. And 6 year old kids can get into  a lot of things. Calling CPS is a huge overreaction, particularly if this has never happened before. If this was a pattern, then it would be different. If he has other behavioral issues, it might be time to get him assesses and get some help.

Older children may set fires due to peer pressure, or as part of gang activity.\n\nFirst thing to do is find out why he did it and make sure it doesn't happen again.and there are all kinds of programs for that.", "Setting fires chronically is. Dicking around with a lighter and some flammables because your mom left shit out and can\u2019t be arsed to keep an eye on you is concerning, but on the part of the parent not that the kid is going to grow up to be a teenage firebug.", "I highly doubt he did it in purpose. At that age, it\u2019s the parents responsibility to keep lights and other items like that away from where kids can teach them.
