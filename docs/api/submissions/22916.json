If you forget to unlock the lighter (it comes out of the package locked) before pressing the button that damn thing is a *pain in the ass* to get unlocked.  It's a good thing because my youngest nephew 6, got ahold of it and couldn't get it to work.  He brought it to my sister, his mother, telling her he wanted to play with it, but it wasn't working.  She lit his ass up for touching the lighter (he had to climb a rickety wooden shelf and dig it out of a basket, so it wasn't even visible, he was snooping.  No, he didn't get spanked he got an epic ass chewing, electronics taken away and time out).  The lighters are now hidden in a better spot, and he hasn't been able to find them.\n\ntagging u/literallylateral, u/OMVince"]}
