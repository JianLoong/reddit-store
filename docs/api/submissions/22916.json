Oh hell no.\nWait until the fire department sends the report to insurance company...\n\n\nNTA", "I'm sure she was set a blaze with anger.", "I remember when I was a kid(this is the 80s and you could just grab a matchbook of the counter at a store) me and my buddy used to take fireworks and our GI Joe airplanes and actually create explosions and even made 2 almost takeoff before exploding by literally strapping as many bottle rockets as we could tape to the wings. \n\nI know we did other things with pyro but that's the one that stands out", "Hey it's OP's nephew too. If anyone was so careless to put any of my family members in that kind of danger, I would be grilling them a lot harder than OP did.", "Someone else saw the TikTok! I couldn\u2019t bring myself to check the comments because some people will defend the craziest things and I didn\u2019t want to read a bunch of people telling commenters to go easy on this clearly neglectful parent.", "I WAS ABOUT TO SAY I JUST SAW IT ON MY FYP!!!", "I saw this too! The damage was insane. FWIW OP, my first thought was also \"how the hell did a 6-year-old get a lighter unsupervised?\"", "It's OP's nephew though. I think it's only right she was just as scared about him and the fact that the mom only got defensive doesn't exactly sit well with me.", "This is the only right answer. OP may be right, but you can still be a TA and be right. I can't believe how far I had to scroll for someone to point this out. Time and place OP!", "I know some kids who thought they could burn a tunnel right through the hay bales stacked in their grandparents' barn by focusing the light from the sun with a magnifying glass. It did not end well (though no one was hurt).\n\nEvidently they've seen it done in some cartoon or something.", "If you look around enough at my house you can probably find 10-15 lighters. Not sure how that is any indication of any sort of decision making.", "I know, right? By 4, my kid could get to literally anywhere. If I buy him a birthday present, it lives in the trunk of my car because that\u2019s the only place he really can\u2019t/won\u2019t get to.", "Or, you know, liking fire. Curiousity. I enjoy a fire, and I\u2019m way older than 6, so they aren\u2019t even a novelty to me. People have bonfires for fun. Campfires. It doesn\u2019t require some sort of mental evaluation.", "He should see someone because he just  went through a traumatic incident and should have competent guidance in processing it before it becomes the foundation of long-term issues. \n\nAlmost any kid that age,given the opportunity,  is pretty much fascinated with fire. Most singe their fingers a few times and decide it's not really all that awesome.  I don't think we should assume there's a pathology in play based on so little information but I have no doubt that he should be spending some time with a qualified child psychologist.", "Heh, at age 4, I watched my dad and neighbor light fireworks with a cigarette. I lit one and set off an M-80. Got a whuppin for it. My mom was especially pissed that I figured out how to light the cigarette and why I did it. I didn\u2019t understand the lighter could light the fuse, I thought I had to use the cigarette.", "[removed]", "Did they have childproof lighters when you were six?\n\nThe lighters they sell now take a level of dexterity most children don't physically have.\n\nHeck, I'm almost 26 and I struggle to use a grill lighter. I keep it- and candles-on hand in case of power outages. \n\nI don't even bother with normal lighters- my hands don't have the dexterity to press the buttons and turn the thing one handed.", "I'm sure they are in there somewhere, because you are right about people being insane in the comments, but the ones I seen are going in on her. I went and found it in my watch history.", "I was able to go in my watch history and find it! Is it wrong if I post it here?", "My first thought is always, \"Why did you think this needed to be a video broadcast to literally millions of people?\" But that was my second thought.", "Half this sub thinks CPS is magical wizards who send all problems down the memory hole with a phone call, and definitely nothing suboptimal ever happens to kids in their care. It's amazing.", "My trunk is my treasure chest. It has so many Jurassic World toys hidden in it that I could I open my own theme park. I love these non-parents-of-first-graders who are like \"lock up your lighters!\" Right. Because everyone has a place to  lock a lighter. \"Or put it somewhere high.\" Yeah, six year olds have NO idea how to climb to places their parents can't reach them. That's not a thing they do.", "yeah unless lighters in the US are super different to the lighters I'm familiar with, we would play with them as kids and run our hand through and go \\*Watch!\\* and when my brother was about 6 he got my slime from the science museum (this was the 90s so slime was exciting af) stuck on the carpet despite being told not to touch the slime and especially not to get it stuck on the carpet so he decided to try and \"melt\" it with a lighter and when I smelled burning and came in to a little carpet fire being stomped on I was livid since I, age 10, was watching him for school holidays so we didn't have to go to vacation care cause I didn't like going.  \n\n\nAnd my parents are like nerdy, serious people. The 90s were a different time :/ lol", "They have ones you just press a single button.", "That too, and sadly it worked because the video got a shitload of views.", "It's not like there's enough funds or foster parents to go around, either.", "Not to mention a lot of the times cps doesn't even do anything- at least not in the experiences of people close to me.", "Or neither, because everyone isn\u2019t as mentally fragile as you must be to think everyone is.", "That seems like all the more reason to never have let it out of her sight in a house with a curious six year old.", "After reading this post, my curiosity got me, and I went and found the video in my watch history. People in the comments are saying they've reported her to CPS, all views aren't good views.", "For sure, that's part of the magical wizards thing.", "A 6 year old burned down the garage and totalled a car. He's 6 he needs a psych eval to be on the safe side. **Next time he could burn down the house.** Or he could have unaddressed trauma forever. \n\nHe's 6 its not about fragility. Its about a developing brain.", "He\u2019s 6 and so he failed to fully put out a fire. He didn\u2019t go \u201coh hey, know what would be fun? Setting a house on fire!\u201d Sounds like it\u2019s you who needs a psych evaluation. The 6 year old is your average 6 year old, not fully thinking through the consequences of his actions, or being thorough.", "6 year old who likes to play with fire becomes arsonist. Next time he's 10 and plays with propane and lights himself on fire.  Because guess what he'll still be a stupid kid not thinking about consequences.", "I\u2019m sorry you apparently have some sort of mental issues, but your average child and your average person that likes fire does not become an arsonist. Everyone I know would be an arsonist by your absolutely terrible logic. And yet we aren\u2019t. I\u2019ve loved fire since I was around 5. Never set a fire anywhere near a building. My kid loves fire. He\u2019s never even set one, though he loves to gather sticks for them. Strangely enough, I don\u2019t know anyone who has set fire to a building (at least unless they were trying to burn it, such as the case with my great uncle and an old shed), and no fires to themselves. Maybe you need to work on your competency.", "That kid isn't average by your own standard. He is 6 and already set fire to a building. That's why he needs to be evaluated."]}
