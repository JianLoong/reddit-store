Thankfully, he didn't start any fires as my parents caught him right away. While they were pissed at him, and rightfully so - they had the matches carefully stored out of reach, he got a chair and got them down, so it wasn't negligence - they instead called my Gramps up and had him come over to handle things. For context, I come from a line of firefighters, all three of whom were multiple-term Chiefs, and my Great-Grandpa was even one of the founders of that firehall back in the 30s. From what I know, Gramps never raised his voice during \"the talk\", but he impressed the seriousness of it through a combination of the power of disappointment and some *VERY* detailed stories on having to deal with calls involving kids playing with matches where the ones with the \"best\" outcomes involved lifelong disfigurement and crippling. As you can guess, he's seen a LOT of shit. (Reminds me, I really need to get him to record his stories for posterity - dude's still active in his fire hall at 88 years old, he's been an active duty firefighter with that company for 70 years now. He doesn't go into buildings anymore, though given the shape he's in, he probably *could*. Does fire police work now, still goes to Chiefs' conventions yearly to talk about new techniques, and could easily get a doctorate in firefighting history without effort.).\n  \nHonestly, with the kind of person my Gramps is, he probably didn't even *need* to tell the stories, because he's SO beloved in my family that just having him be disappointed in you would be painful enough, lol. That said, it worked - my brother never did it again, and took fire safety seriously enough from that moment on that it ended up saving his life last year when a faulty charger caught his house on fire and he had to basically hang out of his attic window because he was on the second floor and the fire blocked the stairs - he had a fire escape ladder in the attic for windows, but couldn't find it in the smoke. He's alright, was a little cut up, but he REALLY needs therapy bad, as he's not coping with the trauma well.\n  \nHonestly, though, the kid in this case both should have therapy *AND* perhaps have a talk with some local firefighters in his area. As long as you get ones that can hammer home exactly *why* playing with fire is a bad idea and that fire must be treated with respect, but in a tactful, not traumatizing way, they're REALLY good for that. I know a number of the fire halls in my area do regular programs for fire safety for kids, often involving hands-on stuff. Sometimes they have this trailer with a fog machine simulating smoke, to show kids how to escape by crawling low to the ground in a safe environment. Stuff like that really stuck with me as a kid.", "Maybe the woman was distracted by her house being engulfed in flames", "Preach!", "Lots of grill lighters or stick lighters aren't childproof.
