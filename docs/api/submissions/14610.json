I understand that she would be crushed that someone she used to be very closed to is not willing to repair the relationship at all. \n\nYou can of course do whatever you want in regards to your wedding party but maybe explain to her your reasons more directly. Maybe the way she learned she was not included was not ideal, especially if she still thought about the promise you both made when you were children.\n\nYou're NTA but from the info you shared here you could be a bit more thoughtful towards her, especially if she is willing to make amends.", "BUT I would not have included the cousin in pre-wedding festivities either.

I have recently I\u2019ve been invited to bachelor parties that were larger than the wedding party and everyone included but not on the stage the day of just joked it was one less suit they had to rent. It was very low key and honestly fun to be included even though I wasn\u2019t a groomsman. It seems to be especially popular with the frat/sor culture since you have such a large friend group from college but want to include others in the fun. Granted- they were up front with their invite. I was not ambushed at a dinner after being told I was invited to the bachelor party.", "Yea. I included my cousins that I had gotten closer to over the past years. This was during the time we had fallen out of contact, and I felt that countless conversations with her prior were always about how \"I hurt her feelings.\" She never owned up to her actions. I could have handled it differently so she didn't feel alienated.", "Exactly! Times change, people change, and grow up. Also, she mentioned \"you said we would be in each other's wedding.\" last I recall saying that, I was probably 12 or 13 years old.", "IKR?
