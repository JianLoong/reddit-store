My gf has a sister, both her and my gf are 25. Over the course of our relationship I have slowly realised that her sister isn't very nice, and she regurlarly finds ways to make her mom give her money. I have never said anything because it's none of my business really.\n\nBut last week I had enough. My gf (and her sister) used to have a brother who died some years ago, he was a bit older than them. As far as I understand this hit my gf's mom extremely hard. She started believing in spirits and ghosts, and has done for a few years now.\n\nSo what my gf's sister decided to do was take advantage of this I suppose. Over the last 1-2 months she has convinced her mom that she can not only speak to ghosts, but to her brother as well. The issue is that she claims her brother needs money. A lot of money. It was small amounts to begin with but it has escalated and I couldn't watch it any longer.\n\nSo, I told her like it was. That she is being used by her daughter and that she is full of shit , basically. Now I should add that I did this without asking my gf first, but in my defence it was not planned, it just happened because we were visiting her mom and she told us this very casually. Like her money was being put to good use. So my first reaction was to just tell her. We knew about this already but I realized just how bad it was during that visit.\n\nLong story short her mom told me to leave the house, and that I can never understand the connection they have with him. My gf also got mad at me for saying it without asking her first. She also says it gives her mom comfort and solace, even though it might not be real. My gf is currently not talking to me, and she says her mom is trying to make her break up with me over this. \n\nI realize I might be TA for just saying it without talking to my girlfriend first, and that it might make her mom happy to have some bond with her son still.

I doubt I'd stay with my bf if he was just allowing this to happen tbh.

Or, you know, knowing the person all your life.\n\nYour gf's mom should see a grief counselor.

Using a mothers grief like that?! WTF?! \n\nI get why your gf is upset, because you should have discussed your thoughts and plans to talk to her mom about it( it sounds like you care about her mom and SOMEONE NEEDS TO!

How convenient Edited", "NTA \n\nMight get hate for this, but your girlfriend is just as terrible for sitting back and watching her sister essentially con their mother out of money.

It boggles the brain.", "ESH\n\nYou are not wrong and it did kind come out a bit blunt.  \n\nYour GF sister is milking her mother for all that she can.  She really is TA here.\n\nThe mother is still seriously grieving and sounds like she might need some professional help.  The brother has been dead for years and it sounds like it's still as fresh as it was yesterday.  You will always grieve for a child, it never goes away... but the mother is grasping at any straw.  Your GF is enabling her by doing what she's doing. \n\nBut I can see that your GF cares for her mother and thinks she's doing the right thing but the help her mother needs is more than she can provide.\n\nYour GF may know all of this which is why she's angry at you because you just highlighted what she was trying to not acknowledge.", "NTA.

You should not have said anything until you at least talked to your GF about it.  \n\nHowever, your GF's mom is in need of mental health/therapy services and is being robbed blind by her own daughter.  I think your GF and her sister are the biggest AHs in this situation.  Your GF for allowing it to happen and obviously her sister for the theft.", "ESH \n\n\nYou ruined any chance your girlfriend had for approaching this compassionately and trying to help her mom. Her mom is just completely on the defensive now and you over stepped your lane. You really think the mom was gonna listen to you?\n\n\nYou should have talked to your girlfriend.

That's a very very hard truth to break and can't be done impulsively.\n\nIf your gf disagree that she needs to know the thuth, that's weird. You should remind her that her sister is commiting elder finance abuse. It's cruel to her mom, she needs to find a healthy way to cope with this loss. Enabling her sister also makes her kind of guilty too.\n\nHer sister is beyond an AH and deserves serious consequences. How can someone scam their own mom and in such a cruel way too?
