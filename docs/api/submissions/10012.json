My gf has a sister, both her and my gf are 25. Over the course of our relationship I have slowly realised that her sister isn't very nice, and she regurlarly finds ways to make her mom give her money. I have never said anything because it's none of my business really.\n\nBut last week I had enough. My gf (and her sister) used to have a brother who died some years ago, he was a bit older than them. As far as I understand this hit my gf's mom extremely hard. She started believing in spirits and ghosts, and has done for a few years now.\n\nSo what my gf's sister decided to do was take advantage of this I suppose. Over the last 1-2 months she has convinced her mom that she can not only speak to ghosts, but to her brother as well. The issue is that she claims her brother needs money. A lot of money. It was small amounts to begin with but it has escalated and I couldn't watch it any longer.\n\nSo, I told her like it was. That she is being used by her daughter and that she is full of shit , basically. Now I should add that I did this without asking my gf first, but in my defence it was not planned, it just happened because we were visiting her mom and she told us this very casually. Like her money was being put to good use. So my first reaction was to just tell her. We knew about this already but I realized just how bad it was during that visit.\n\nLong story short her mom told me to leave the house, and that I can never understand the connection they have with him. My gf also got mad at me for saying it without asking her first. She also says it gives her mom comfort and solace, even though it might not be real. My gf is currently not talking to me, and she says her mom is trying to make her break up with me over this. \n\nI realize I might be TA for just saying it without talking to my girlfriend first, and that it might make her mom happy to have some bond with her son still. It feels weird to let somebody get used like that though.", "created_utc": 1676459053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112vifx/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriends_mom_that_she_is/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was deplorable. I cut her toxic ass out of my life. I could not imagine sitting back and watching it happen.

Are there any other family members that can be alerted?  GF may break up with you but this is a serious issue especially since it involves significant sums of money.  Depending on your country there maybe hot lines that you can contact for investigation.  \n\nYou not talking to your girlfriend first does not make you the AH.  Your gut was spot on, this is absolutely wrong.  NTA by the way.", "On one hand I do feel quite bad for your gf, she no doubt saw her Mother broken by what happened and feels a certain sense of relief now that she's no longer in that place. But honestly, I think allowing her Mother to be conned out of money from her own child is cowardly. Especially considering this manipulator is evoking her dead Brother in order to do it. I doubt I'd stay with my bf if he was just allowing this to happen tbh.

The fact your gf got mad at you for telling her the truth is insane.\n\n>I can never understand the connection they have with him\n\nThe lies she fed their mom is so bad that she is 100% in denial. \n\n>She also says it gives her mom comfort and solace, even though it might not be real\n\nComfort and solace is being there for your mom in her time of need; NOT tricking her into giving you [sister] a bunch of money", "NTA.

That GF was OK with this speaks I'll of her.", "Why would a ghost need money?", "NTA\n\nWhile I personally firmly believe in an afterlife and \"spirits\", and even know people who contact them (it really annoys them, frankly), there is literally no way your gf's sister was suddenly able to contact them.\n\nShe's doing what's called \"cold reading.\"  It's very easy to do and just requires giving leading questions.  Or, you know, knowing the person all your life.\n\nYour gf's mom should see a grief counselor.  And, if she wants to talk to a medium, she should find one who does not know her --- and who can give her information **nobody** but her brother would know.  **Without gf's mother giving information by the questions she asks.** That filters out the \"cold readers.\"", "INFO - how did the mum think a dead person would use money? I don\u2019t understand?", "Oh this made me so sad!!!\n\nSo your gf has a sister who\u2019s dead brother is saying through her that HE needs money?! WHY?!  Do they have vending machines where his spirt is? Cars? Banks? Homes he has to by? \n\nThat young woman has (I hate to use this term) GASLIGHTED her mother and it\u2019s AWFUL!! Using a mothers grief like that?! WTF?! \n\nI get why your gf is upset, because you should have discussed your thoughts and plans to talk to her mom about it( it sounds like you care about her mom and SOMEONE NEEDS TO! Not that your gf doesn\u2019t but clearer heads usually prevail here\u2026 ) I\u2019m kind of angry and I don\u2019t even have a dog in this fight! \n\nI\u2019m so so sorry for the loss of gf brother. \n\nI\u2019m going for \n\nNTA \n\nSOMEONE has to look out for her mom and gf is grieving and may not be seeing it for what it is! So I understand that. Sister is a BIG  sh here for taking advantage of her grief stricken mother \ud83d\ude22\n\nI may be taking the who situation wrong.. but I\u2019ve heard of some low down dirty shit but this takes the cake!! Especially since gf sister all of a sudden got into the \u201cspirt world after brother dies and says he needs money. How convenient Edited", "NTA \n\nMight get hate for this, but your girlfriend is just as terrible for sitting back and watching her sister essentially con their mother out of money. She is a grieving mother. Those actions are downright immoral and cruel. Do you really want to be with someone capable of sitting back and even justifying behaviour like this?", "NTA dump your GF. She\u2019s as much of an asshole as her sister is for not putting a stop to this ages a go. It boggles the brain.", "ESH\n\nYou are not wrong and it did kind come out a bit blunt.  \n\nYour GF sister is milking her mother for all that she can.  She really is TA here.\n\nThe mother is still seriously grieving and sounds like she might need some professional help.  The brother has been dead for years and it sounds like it's still as fresh as it was yesterday.  You will always grieve for a child, it never goes away... but the mother is grasping at any straw.  Your GF is enabling her by doing what she's doing. \n\nBut I can see that your GF cares for her mother and thinks she's doing the right thing but the help her mother needs is more than she can provide.\n\nYour GF may know all of this which is why she's angry at you because you just highlighted what she was trying to not acknowledge.", "NTA. Ghosts aren't real. Don't waste your time with someone who believes or even might believe in them at that includes your gf.", "ESH, but more them than you.  You should not have said anything until you at least talked to your GF about it.  \n\nHowever, your GF's mom is in need of mental health/therapy services and is being robbed blind by her own daughter.  I think your GF and her sister are the biggest AHs in this situation.  Your GF for allowing it to happen and obviously her sister for the theft.", "ESH \n\n\nYou ruined any chance your girlfriend had for approaching this compassionately and trying to help her mom. Her mom is just completely on the defensive now and you over stepped your lane. You really think the mom was gonna listen to you?\n\n\nYou should have talked to your girlfriend.

You did cross a line but I think any decent person would have a bard time not saying something. You gf is just standing by letting her own mother get taken advantage of, would have me questioning my relationship honestly. Sister is an AH for obvious reasons. Idk where you\u2019re at or if the situation really calls for it but the better solution would\u2019ve been to report anonymously to adult protective services that these daughters are using their mothers untreated grief to swindle money from her, or gently talk to your gf and convince HER to do something about it.", "I have the same question.", "I mean, yeah. Gf told him it's not real but brings mom \"comfort and solace\" and is mad at him for pointing out the obvious.  It's gross what gf is letting sis get away with, basically swindling their own mom and using mom's grief for profit. Truly disgusting.", "I think the GF is perhaps in a rough position. Watching your Mother be absolutely crippled by the death of their own child and then find them in a seemingly more positive state of mind must feel like a bit of relief. I witnessed a not too dissimilar situation and I understand the thought of taking that away from her Mother must be heartbreaking.\n\nThat being said, someone else mentioned elder financial abuse and I think they're absolutely right. Someone needed to step in. In the long run it's perhaps better that it was an outsider and not the daughter but still, it's gonna feel like the only winner here is the thief who is manipulating her Mother.", "She didn\u2019t just sit back and watch, she tried to defend it too.\n\n>She also says it gives her mom comfort and solace, even though it might not be real", "Spot on.

I wonder if there's any legal recourse in OP's jurisdiction.\n\nOP, it might be worth seeking legal advice regarding elder financial abuse. You're gonna want to get your GF on board first though.", "I could have phrased that better but I sincerely believe that people who claim they can talk to ghosts (even more so if those \"ghosts\" only talk for money) and others who don't dismiss that notion immediately are no long-time partners.
