The way I see it people are entitled to act how they want but they can\u2019t then complain when other people react how they want.", "NTA. They should have been more thoughtful about whether it was a good idea to use the name, and should have asked the sibling who lost their child or someone else in the family whether it was okay. I'm so sorry your family went through this.", "Info: have you asked WHY they choose that name? Not why did they not \"ask for permission.\" (you and your family are not entitled to having them discuss with you about using a name.) Is it possible that it could have been important to her partners family? What did you think you would accomplish by confronting her about the name?", "I\u2019m a firm believer in minding your own business when it comes to the names of other people\u2019s children, but this falls well outside of that rule. NTA. What your youngest sibling did was hurtful in the worst possible way\u2026not only to do this but to spring it on everyone. The sibling that lost her child is still severely reeling and probably always will be.\n\nYoungest sibling may have been aiming for closure, but they landed on pure cruelty.\n\nHowever, now that you have addressed it with them, the best thing to do is move on and not mention it again. No more lectures, no more gossip, and no being awkward around the child as they grow up. It\u2019s going to be difficult. Your strong feelings will persist. But what\u2019s done is done, and your job is now to love this new little person unconditionally. Only you can decide how close you want to be with your youngest sibling moving forward, but whatever happens, that is now kiddo\u2019s name and it is not kiddo\u2019s fault. They should never overhear or be made to feel that their family despises anything about them.", "NTA i suspect your sibling was trying to honour the memory and had good intentions but there is a road paved with those and she should have checked first to avoid trauma", "I personally think YTA. For all you know, this could have been your siblings way of honouring the deceased childs memory. I know lots of people who name babies after lost ones, and I don't think they should ever have to ask permission.", "NAH: I understand you not being happy about the name. But there's only one person the youngest would need to ask about the name and that's your other sibling.  From what you described, do you think your sibling is mentally in the right place to honestly answer that question?", "NAH\n\nMaybe your sibling felt this was a beautiful way to honor a passed family member, and in the end they have 100% authority to name their child as they see fit regardless of others possible hurt feelings.", ">WITHOUT discussing with ANYONE\n\nThey didn't discuss it because they knew you'd all be against it. For a good reason.\n\nThat sibling is a huge AH.\n\nNTA.", "[deleted]", "NAH - This person was 12/13 and probably not emotionally mature enough to understand the trauma.  They probably thought it was a good thing, doing it as a tribute.  So not knowing her side of the name, it's hard to say.  What if that's the name her husband always wanted?\n\nYeah it would have been great to discuss the name.", "NTA I\u2019m more worried about the new baby now because you said the sibling that lost a baby thinks that the government holograms are chasing her trying to give back her dead  child. What will happen when she realizes there is a child with the same name as her dead child that\u2019s alive and well? Will she harm the child? Will she kidnap the child? Will other issues occur?

I have a friend named after their mom\u2019s deceased sibling (who also died as a result of a tragedy). One cousin was named the feminine version of her deceased uncle\u2019s name, and lots of friends were named after deceased grandpas.\n\n\nI\u2019m a bit surprised at all the comments saying that name should have been pre-approved by the family, but it could be that at your place of living there are different customs.\n\nWhy she didn\u2019t discuss it with the sister seems apparent, as the sister is not of sound mind.

Sounds like she was pretty traumatized too.", "Info - I am honestly kind of stuck on the fact that your sibling was forced (or at least allowed) to witness this traumatic event when they were only 12/13yo. That sounds completely inappropriate.", "Without fail, my go-to response is not your business. However, this sounds like it very much is your business and you're speaking on behalf of a vulnerable sibling. I cannot fathom the reasoning behind the name choice, but I would expect that the same trauma that you experienced during the passing hit her even harder and this is a mechanism to heal. Reach out again and have a heart-to-heart. It probably didn't do you any favours to start with a giant \"why did you do this?!\", but that's all said and done now.

As far as discussing it with anyone, it certainly would have been nice to talk to the rest of the family about the decision, they didn\u2019t necessarily need to ask permission, but a heads up would have been nice if their mind was made up.  Not sure if the schizophrenic sibling would be in a good place to discuss that?", "NAH here, but you are missing a big point. this familial trauma, as you put it, _also_ happened to the sib that just had the baby, and actually at the point of the most formative experiences (~age 12) - so you really don\u2019t know what sort of impact this had on her. she lived it too, yes?\n\nbecause of the grief and trauma involved i\u2019m going NAH, but it really wasn\u2019t fair of you to decide what the name and this piece of family history means to your sibling.", "I was honestly leaning N A H until I read what your sibling who lost the child went thru after the loss. Yeah, I think that other sibling is a HUGE AH.\n\nNTA OP. I\u2019m sorry your family went thru/is going thru that & now has had to have old wounds opened.", "NTA it was insensitive given the depth and severity of the trauma. No one owns a name but she has put a permanent sadness attached to her child that will always be in the back of the family\u2019s minds. Not to mention the potential consequences given your other sisters mental state. You were extremely mature about it given the circumstances. She chose a controversial name in the family without consideration of anyones else\u2019s feelings on it. What a weight to put on an innocent child.", "Using originals name as a middle name would have been a more appropriate and acceptable way to honor their memory. NTA OP and definitely a tough spot to be in.", "NTA\nThe mom who lost her child in OP's situation CAN'T advocate for herself so her family absolutely has the right to do it for her. \n\nMy sister ASKED our aunt if she could name her daughter after our cousin who was killed in a car accident. Our aunt said yes. She never would have done it otherwise!", "NTA. I don\u2019t think the youngest sib gets a pass just because they experienced the trauma *too*. I\u2019m sure they *did* reuse the name in earnest to try to cope with/honor/unpack this complex and ongoing situation. But there\u2019s so many more in the family than just them, and it just feels *not well thought out.*\n\nTheir child is now going to grow up with a name that\u2019s tied to very dark family history and may carry around some of that baggage.\n\nAlso, by default is it not frowned upon to use a sibling\u2019s kid\u2019s name for your own, especially a dead one? Unless it\u2019s a family name. I think it would\u2019ve been alright to use it as a middle name, but a first name is just too much imo.", "NTA, holy shit. I understand wanting to honor the family member you lost - especially, at a pivotal moment in your own emotional development - but it's extremely obvious whose loss is greater here. \n\nThe fact that this child will have to reap the emotional baggage attached to that name with their family is akin to child cruelty, as well.

Tragically your family lost a child way too soon in a very traumatic moment. If you believe your sister was trying to be hurtful then there\u2019s really no reason she could give to explain herself. Perhaps she believes it\u2019s time to remember the joy this child brought to her life in that small amount of time with them.
