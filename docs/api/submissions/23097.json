Ten? 15? You said a few years but a few years to me has the connotation of not that long ago whereas their age when the death happened had the connotation of a while ago, over a decade.", "NTA - a they knew people were not going to be happy and did it anyway. The way I see it people are entitled to act how they want but they can\u2019t then complain when other people react how they want.", "NTA. They should have been more thoughtful about whether it was a good idea to use the name, and should have asked the sibling who lost their child or someone else in the family whether it was okay. I'm so sorry your family went through this.", "Info: have you asked WHY they choose that name? Not why did they not \"ask for permission.\" (you and your family are not entitled to having them discuss with you about using a name.) Is it possible that it could have been important to her partners family? What did you think you would accomplish by confronting her about the name?", "I\u2019m a firm believer in minding your own business when it comes to the names of other people\u2019s children, but this falls well outside of that rule. NTA. What your youngest sibling did was hurtful in the worst possible way\u2026not only to do this but to spring it on everyone. The sibling that lost her child is still severely reeling and probably always will be.\n\nYoungest sibling may have been aiming for closure, but they landed on pure cruelty.\n\nHowever, now that you have addressed it with them, the best thing to do is move on and not mention it again. No more lectures, no more gossip, and no being awkward around the child as they grow up. It\u2019s going to be difficult. Your strong feelings will persist. But what\u2019s done is done, and your job is now to love this new little person unconditionally. Only you can decide how close you want to be with your youngest sibling moving forward, but whatever happens, that is now kiddo\u2019s name and it is not kiddo\u2019s fault. They should never overhear or be made to feel that their family despises anything about them.", "NTA i suspect your sibling was trying to honour the memory and had good intentions but there is a road paved with those and she should have checked first to avoid trauma", "I personally think YTA. For all you know, this could have been your siblings way of honouring the deceased childs memory. I know lots of people who name babies after lost ones, and I don't think they should ever have to ask permission.", "NAH: I understand you not being happy about the name. But there's only one person the youngest would need to ask about the name and that's your other sibling.  From what you described, do you think your sibling is mentally in the right place to honestly answer that question?", "NAH\n\nMaybe your sibling felt this was a beautiful way to honor a passed family member, and in the end they have 100% authority to name their child as they see fit regardless of others possible hurt feelings.", ">WITHOUT discussing with ANYONE\n\nThey didn't discuss it because they knew you'd all be against it. For a good reason.\n\nThat sibling is a huge AH.\n\nNTA.", "YTA. It's already done, what did you hope to gain by bringing it up? Them to legally change the baby's name? The mom to grovel for forgiveness?\n\nNobody owns a name, not even in such tragic circumstances.\nIt was not your place to address it.", "NAH - This person was 12/13 and probably not emotionally mature enough to understand the trauma.  They probably thought it was a good thing, doing it as a tribute.  So not knowing her side of the name, it's hard to say.  What if that's the name her husband always wanted?\n\nYeah it would have been great to discuss the name.", "NTA I\u2019m more worried about the new baby now because you said the sibling that lost a baby thinks that the government holograms are chasing her trying to give back her dead  child. What will happen when she realizes there is a child with the same name as her dead child that\u2019s alive and well? Will she harm the child? Will she kidnap the child? Will other issues occur? Seems like your other sibling is not only cold hearted for giving the child that name but hasn\u2019t really thought of what would happen with your not stable sibling", "NAH. \n\nActually where I live, naming a child after a deceased cousing is not at all weird and it is kind of an honor. I have a friend named after their mom\u2019s deceased sibling (who also died as a result of a tragedy). One cousin was named the feminine version of her deceased uncle\u2019s name, and lots of friends were named after deceased grandpas.\n\n\nI\u2019m a bit surprised at all the comments saying that name should have been pre-approved by the family, but it could be that at your place of living there are different customs.\n\nWhy she didn\u2019t discuss it with the sister seems apparent, as the sister is not of sound mind. But how come the rest of the family never asked her about the baby name during pregnancy? Or did she refuse to share it?", "INFO how much therapy has your youngest sister had? Sounds like she was pretty traumatized too.", "Info - I am honestly kind of stuck on the fact that your sibling was forced (or at least allowed) to witness this traumatic event when they were only 12/13yo. That sounds completely inappropriate.", "Without fail, my go-to response is not your business. However, this sounds like it very much is your business and you're speaking on behalf of a vulnerable sibling. I cannot fathom the reasoning behind the name choice, but I would expect that the same trauma that you experienced during the passing hit her even harder and this is a mechanism to heal. Reach out again and have a heart-to-heart. It probably didn't do you any favours to start with a giant \"why did you do this?!\", but that's all said and done now. Try to move on and congratulations on the new family member. NAH", "NTA \nYour sibling knows exactly what she was doing, it was intentional and cruel.", "NTA - I can see how they might have been trying to honor the toddler who passed and I can see a glimmer of positive sentiments in their actions, BUT I feel like you don\u2019t do that in the same generation of children like maybe the other two children of the now schizophrenic sibling could name their children after the toddler who passed but it almost feels like they are trying to replace them in the same generation if that makes sense.  As far as discussing it with anyone, it certainly would have been nice to talk to the rest of the family about the decision, they didn\u2019t necessarily need to ask permission, but a heads up would have been nice if their mind was made up.  Not sure if the schizophrenic sibling would be in a good place to discuss that?", "NAH here, but you are missing a big point. this familial trauma, as you put it, _also_ happened to the sib that just had the baby, and actually at the point of the most formative experiences (~age 12) - so you really don\u2019t know what sort of impact this had on her. she lived it too, yes?\n\nbecause of the grief and trauma involved i\u2019m going NAH, but it really wasn\u2019t fair of you to decide what the name and this piece of family history means to your sibling.", "I was honestly leaning N A H until I read what your sibling who lost the child went thru after the loss. Yeah, I think that other sibling is a HUGE AH.\n\nNTA OP. I\u2019m sorry your family went thru/is going thru that & now has had to have old wounds opened.", "NTA it was insensitive given the depth and severity of the trauma. No one owns a name but she has put a permanent sadness attached to her child that will always be in the back of the family\u2019s minds. Not to mention the potential consequences given your other sisters mental state. You were extremely mature about it given the circumstances. She chose a controversial name in the family without consideration of anyones else\u2019s feelings on it. What a weight to put on an innocent child.", "Using originals name as a middle name would have been a more appropriate and acceptable way to honor their memory. NTA OP and definitely a tough spot to be in.", "NTA\nThe mom who lost her child in OP's situation CAN'T advocate for herself so her family absolutely has the right to do it for her. \n\nMy sister ASKED our aunt if she could name her daughter after our cousin who was killed in a car accident. Our aunt said yes. She never would have done it otherwise!", "NTA. I don\u2019t think the youngest sib gets a pass just because they experienced the trauma *too*. I\u2019m sure they *did* reuse the name in earnest to try to cope with/honor/unpack this complex and ongoing situation. But there\u2019s so many more in the family than just them, and it just feels *not well thought out.*\n\nTheir child is now going to grow up with a name that\u2019s tied to very dark family history and may carry around some of that baggage.\n\nAlso, by default is it not frowned upon to use a sibling\u2019s kid\u2019s name for your own, especially a dead one? Unless it\u2019s a family name. I think it would\u2019ve been alright to use it as a middle name, but a first name is just too much imo.", "NTA, holy shit. I understand wanting to honor the family member you lost - especially, at a pivotal moment in your own emotional development - but it's extremely obvious whose loss is greater here. \n\nThe fact that this child will have to reap the emotional baggage attached to that name with their family is akin to child cruelty, as well. It was idiotic at best.", "NTA, that was so incredibly cruel of your sister", "YTA\n\nShe doesn't have to ask.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

[editing to add after another comment from OP: the sib that just gave birth also witnessed the accident that took the original toddler, did not have any therapy afterwards, and the family banned talking about it.] \n\nmy point was only that OP is seeing this very much through the lens of their own (direct) experience, and understandably so. but the sib that just had the baby also experienced the loss and family trauma.", "my judgement of NAH means i perceive a path of mutual empathy where both can exist vs. one is right and one is wrong. \n\ni just can\u2019t get past a 12 year old watching a toddler have that kind of accident and then not being given any therapy or allowed to talk about it. i can also fully empathize with how terrible it must feel for OP.", "sure, that would have been an option as well. i am not saying i agree with what youngest sib did - only that it was also _her_ lived family experience as well, she also owns that. \n\nin fact it\u2019s possible that for her, using the name was a way of reclaiming joy around something that marked her entire childhood/teen years (significant growth/developmental years) with crushing grief. \n\ncan\u2019t know what others think when it comes to something like this, which is why i went for the NAH.", "Of course they do. You realize I am speaking of this *very specific* instance, right?", "Hugh?", "Mustelidae?", "Based on your comments it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s an option.

Also, is this a common name? \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone can judge this because no one here has experienced the trauma you have been through but your family would definitely understand. \n\nYour sister didn\u2019t actually need anyone\u2019s permission to use the name however it certainly would have been a more thoughtful & sensitive way to approach this. Who would she have asked?\n\nI\u2019m not defending your sister .... but ... she was young when this happened. Perhaps the reason she didn\u2019t discuss with anyone is because it\u2019s a taboo subject in your family. Perhaps she is choosing to remember & honor the life that was lost so soon. Tragically your family lost a child way too soon in a very traumatic moment. If you believe your sister was trying to be hurtful then there\u2019s really no reason she could give to explain herself. Perhaps she believes it\u2019s time to remember the joy this child brought to her life in that small amount of time with them. You should definitely ask what her perspective is... without accusing her. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your family. I hope y\u2019all can work this out. Grief is really tough emotion.
