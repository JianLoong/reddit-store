The way I see it people are entitled to act how they want but they can\u2019t then complain when other people react how they want.", "NTA. They should have been more thoughtful about whether it was a good idea to use the name, and should have asked the sibling who lost their child or someone else in the family whether it was okay. I'm so sorry your family went through this.", "Info: have you asked WHY they choose that name? Not why did they not \"ask for permission.\" (you and your family are not entitled to having them discuss with you about using a name.)

The sibling that lost her child is still severely reeling and probably always will be.\n\nYoungest sibling may have been aiming for closure, but they landed on pure cruelty.\n\nHowever, now that you have addressed it with them, the best thing to do is move on and not mention it again. No more lectures, no more gossip, and no being awkward around the child as they grow up. It\u2019s going to be difficult. Your strong feelings will persist. But what\u2019s done is done, and your job is now to love this new little person unconditionally. Only you can decide how close you want to be with your youngest sibling moving forward, but whatever happens, that is now kiddo\u2019s name and it is not kiddo\u2019s fault. They should never overhear or be made to feel that their family despises anything about them.", "NTA i suspect your sibling was trying to honour the memory and had good intentions but there is a road paved with those and she should have checked first to avoid trauma", "I personally think YTA. For all you know, this could have been your siblings way of honouring the deceased childs memory. I know lots of people who name babies after lost ones, and I don't think they should ever have to ask permission.", "NAH: I understand you not being happy about the name.

From what you described, do you think your sibling is mentally in the right place to honestly answer that question?", "NAH\n\nMaybe your sibling felt this was a beautiful way to honor a passed family member, and in the end they have 100% authority to name their child as they see fit regardless of others possible hurt feelings.", ">WITHOUT discussing with ANYONE\n\nThey didn't discuss it because they knew you'd all be against it.

What will happen when she realizes there is a child with the same name as her dead child that\u2019s alive and well? Will she harm the child? Will she kidnap the child? Will other issues occur?

I have a friend named after their mom\u2019s deceased sibling (who also died as a result of a tragedy). One cousin was named the feminine version of her deceased uncle\u2019s name, and lots of friends were named after deceased grandpas.\n\n\nI\u2019m a bit surprised at all the comments saying that name should have been pre-approved by the family, but it could be that at your place of living there are different customs.\n\nWhy she didn\u2019t discuss it with the sister seems apparent, as the sister is not of sound mind.

That sounds completely inappropriate.", "Without fail, my go-to response is not your business. However, this sounds like it very much is your business and you're speaking on behalf of a vulnerable sibling. I cannot fathom the reasoning behind the name choice, but I would expect that the same trauma that you experienced during the passing hit her even harder and this is a mechanism to heal. Reach out again and have a heart-to-heart. It probably didn't do you any favours to start with a giant \"why did you do this?!\", but that's all said and done now.

As far as discussing it with anyone, it certainly would have been nice to talk to the rest of the family about the decision, they didn\u2019t necessarily need to ask permission, but a heads up would have been nice if their mind was made up.  Not sure if the schizophrenic sibling would be in a good place to discuss that?", "[deleted]", "I was honestly leaning N A H until I read what your sibling who lost the child went thru after the loss.

No one owns a name but she has put a permanent sadness attached to her child that will always be in the back of the family\u2019s minds. Not to mention the potential consequences given your other sisters mental state. You were extremely mature about it given the circumstances. She chose a controversial name in the family without consideration of anyones else\u2019s feelings on it. What a weight to put on an innocent child.", "Using originals name as a middle name would have been a more appropriate and acceptable way to honor their memory.

Our aunt said yes. She never would have done it otherwise!", "NTA. I don\u2019t think the youngest sib gets a pass just because they experienced the trauma *too*. I\u2019m sure they *did* reuse the name in earnest to try to cope with/honor/unpack this complex and ongoing situation. But there\u2019s so many more in the family than just them, and it just feels *not well thought out.*\n\nTheir child is now going to grow up with a name that\u2019s tied to very dark family history and may carry around some of that baggage.\n\nAlso, by default is it not frowned upon to use a sibling\u2019s kid\u2019s name for your own, especially a dead one? Unless it\u2019s a family name. I think it would\u2019ve been alright to use it as a middle name, but a first name is just too much imo.", "NTA, holy shit. I understand wanting to honor the family member you lost - especially, at a pivotal moment in your own emotional development - but it's extremely obvious whose loss is greater here. \n\nThe fact that this child will have to reap the emotional baggage attached to that name with their family is akin to child cruelty, as well.

Even if actual violence is rare, it's not impossible. (ETA: And I missed the first time around that OP's sibling actually was arrested for drug use, which does increase the risk of violence as well.) A psychotic episode directed at a child doesn't have to get violent to get scary and traumatic, and given sibling's delusions, it seems like this could easily trigger one.\n\n(Not saying that you were saying that the sibling would get violent, but just adding it because I see that implication floating around a lot in these comment threads, and I think it's important to keep people educated.)", "I'm so sorry for your neighbors and your friends who went through this horrifying situation.

Even if Sibling doesn't get violent, if this triggers a psychotic episode in front of the child, that can be incredibly scary and traumatic. Also, even if none of Sibling's actions actually affect the baby, it's so cruel to do that to Sibling, knowing that it'll probably cause them to suffer. They might feel the need to remove themself from family gatherings and end up cutting themself off from their support network to avoid this trigger, and at the very least, it'll likely cause them a great deal of anguish.\n\nJust pointless cruelty, all the way around.\n\nETA: Also, the risk of violence increases when the psychotic person uses drugs or alcohol, and I missed the first time around that OP's sibling has a drug problem, so...

I am not schizophrenic but have a degree of paranoid ideation in my mental health cocktail of challenges, and while it's at a manageable level now after a great deal of therapy and with consistent work and medication, I could absolutely see 13yo me in that situation believing that the spirit of the original nibling was trapped within me, waiting to be reborn. These days, if my brain came up with a thought like that, I could accept that it's impossible to know if it's actually true but that it's not a useful thought; and even if it is true, the trauma to my loved ones of consistently forcing them to remember that loss would outweigh the sense that I should give the reincarnated spirit consistency by reusing the name. But it doesn't sound like anyone has ever taken the time or energy to see how your youngest sibling was impacted by the loss they should never have been exposed to, and if her thoughts have been dismissed in the past, she may have felt more isolated and unable to discuss the issue with you. Try to discuss her motivation again, with an absolutely open mind - maybe phrase it as \"I know you would never want to hurt any of us by reminding us of that loss, so there MUST be something I am missing and I would really appreciate it if you would explain it to me\". Don't try to deny or dismiss. Just do your best to get an idea of what is going on, and if necessary, discuss it with a professional. If there is something like this going on, I would advise against any \"damage control\" in terms of official renaming until your youngest sibling suggests it herself; but if (and ONLY if) you think that using that name even on a temporary basis might be too much for your family to bear, you might ask her if she would be open to a nickname.", "Or make it the middle name."]}
