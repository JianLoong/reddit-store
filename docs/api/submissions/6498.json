This year, my dad was recovering from a surgery, so I offered to host at my new house, which I share with my girlfriend.  \n\nWhen I was planning the party, I at first didn't really know what to do about my aunt Marie. She's always been pretty homophobic, she'd always be talking shit about \"the gays\" when I was a kid before she knew. \n\nWhen I came out in my 20s she becaume really frosty to me and basically stopped talking to me. \n\nSo when I was planning the Christmas party, there was no way I was exclusing my girlfriend who's estranged from her own family, or putting her in a situation she has to face more bigotry. I also didn't really want to have my aunt over for my own sake, like I'm more used to it but it still makes stuff tense. And it was my own damn house. So I ended up inviting all the family except my aunt.\n\nMy dad angrily confronted me about it, and I basically told him that I know he never allows someone who'd disrespects him or his wife into his home. Now I'm not a kid anymore - I'm as old as he was when he became a parent, I own my own home, and I'm going to be handling my household the way he raised me to, with respect for myself and my partner. \n\nHe actually apologized for putting me in an uncomfortable spot when I was young. He planned a Christmas Day dinner with her and their other siblings. \n\nThe Christmas eve party itself was lovely. \n\nWell, on Christmas day, my aunt posted this lengthy rant about how young people are \"cancelling Christmas\" and about her \"woke\" niece. It was super long and super out of touch, like there's no big conspiracy to cancel family or whatever, I just personally didn't want her there. \n\nI replied \"I assume this is about me not inviting you to the Christmas Eve party? Honestly, the holidays weren't cancelled, I just didn't invite you personally, as you have expressed hateful views towards me such as (i wrote a long bulleted list that is taking this way over the word limit here but some of the stuff on it was stuff like being glad aids kiled a lot of (f slur))\n\nI said \"Anyway, since I'm a lesbian and I share my home with my girlfriend, I specifically uninvited you due to your behavior towards me in the past.

She is out to get me. (Which obviously she's done things to warrant such treatment, but she's trying to get pity and likely turn the family to her side.)\n\nIt's hard, but it's better in the long run to avoid the facebook drama, that is sort of the ESH part since stooping to her level can almost serve to reinforce and validate whatever bullshit she's spewing in a public forum.\n\nBut at the end of the day, hopefully she just leaves you alone and can reflect a bit on what an asshole she's been in the past.

That was a beautiful response.\n\nIf she can post shit so can you.\n\nMaybe not best road to take, but I am petty like that.", "NTA\n\nObviously", "NTA. She brought it to Facebook, not you. Your family was fine with her calling you out and not expecting you to defend yourself?", "NTA. Never invite those family members back who are coming at you. By attacking you, they\u2019re implying her behavior is acceptable while maintaining boundaries for yourself is not. If she didn\u2019t want to get called out, she shouldn\u2019t have been whining on Facebook", "Bwahahahaha!!!  NTA\n\nIt\u2019s good when bigots are exposed.  She brought this on herself entirely, and if she had any sense of shame would apologize profusely for anything hateful she\u2019s said in the past.\n\nWill that happen?  I doubt it.  My guess is she doubles-down or denies everything.", "If she can\u2019t handle what you said, she shouldn\u2019t have posted.

She started spewing petty bullshit, you responded in a mature manner outlining why her bullshit is patently false.  \n\nGood for you.", "NTA.  I'm sorry that your family is protecting a homophobe instead of you.", "NTA. I believe your aunt enjoyed the \"f around\" portion of this interaction but not the \"find out\" part. She started it, you ended it. Good for you.", "NTA! Some ppl need to be publicly slapped down and humiliated. I\u2019m glad you did it. \n\nMaybe it\u2019ll console your Aunty if you made a donation to a charity that helps LGBTQQ+ youth, all in the name of Christian charity, of course ;)", "I applaud you.

She F'd around and found out.", "NTA\n\nImagine them being mad and enabling her homophobic behavior instead of holding her accountable and standing up for mistreatment  of a family member", "NTA\n\nHa ha, absolutely not the a. \n\nAlso your aunt is allowed to say things on an open forum and you're not allowed to call her out on it? Yeah, fuck that.", "NTA...this aunt had it coming. Don't want to be called a homophobic AH...don't be a homophobic AH.", "NTA. Don't be crying over a homophobic bigot who chose to start a public debate about it.", ">Some of my family was even saying it was shitty of me to list homophobic stuff she said before she knew I was gay?? \n\nKeep track of these people. They're honest homophobes down to their core and the only reason they haven't been outwardly homophobic towards you is because of social pressure.", "NTA.  The way you explained it to your dad was brilliant, and your response to your aunt's rant was not inappropriate, in a \"if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen\" kind of way.  \n\nThe aunt's overt homophobia and unkindness toward you is what caused her not to be invited.  She can try to put it on you all she likes, but it's her narrow-minded bigotry that got her excluded.  She's the A here, not you.", "nta they want you to take homophobic abuse and shut up about it. fuck that. call your aunt out.", "NTA if it isn't the consequences of her own actions", "NTA. the subtext behind \"it's shitty to list the homophobic shit she said before she knew you were gay\" is \"you shouldn't have a problem with her being homophobic as long as she's not directing it at you\". the rest of your family have presumably had longer than 20 years to try to correct her or call out her homophobia. if they're okay with excusing it/her, then maybe they don't need to come to christmas next year either lol", "NTA and She 100% had it coming. I just hope she learned something (I know unlikely) and that other people she has treated that way got to see the way you responded.", "lol. NTA. Bigots get wrecked.", "NTA. \nSigned A dot Ham", "NTA. \n\nI have cousins I don\u2019t get along with. They spent about thirty four years bullying me, then their kid started bullying mine which I put an immediate stop to.

They were shocked- shocked, I tell you- that they weren\u2019t invited to my wedding. \n\nHeres the thing, though. You don\u2019t get to say and do whatever you want to people and expect them to take it, even if they\u2019re family.

Just that she got called out for it? Karmas a b*tch. Time to apologize and learn from past mistakes not attack your victims.", "NTA, good for you!", "Fuck yeah, get er ass!\n\nNTA", "NTA but do you have a screenshot of the post and comments cause I'd love to see the meltdown", "Eh NTA, how are other members of your family even on her side?

Tell the rest of the family that you kept things short and sweet, but if they would like you to go to far, you could.

Good on you for standing up for yourself and your partner.", "NTA you\u2019re a fucking hero.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to make a vague call out post then her and the family should be ready for her to be called out as well.", "NTA\u2026..people who want to receive sympathy in public spaces by omitting the truth are people who big their own grave. YOU didn\u2019t publicly call her out, YOU didn\u2019t say bigoted things for your entire life, You didn\u2019t support someone bashing an entire group of people, YOU didn\u2019t choose to be who you are and have someone hate you for existing. \n\nYOU DID SET HEALTHY BOUNDARIES FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY, if they can\u2019t see this maybe turn all that language into questions directed at them? Trade it off with males, women, tall people, short people, skin tone, religious affiliation, etc. ask if they would want to be around someone who said things like this about them? Also point out that they allow someone to treat their child or family this way and maybe you need to take a big step back from all of them because they have shown you a bigots opinions are more important than your mental health and well-being.\n\nYou do see that your family has no issue with your aunt being a bigot but just that everyone now knows the abuse they tolerate and condone. \n\nShe decided to fuck around and find out\u2026you just gave all the fuck around info so people can decide if they really want to feel sorry for a bigot.", "I think the whole thing is out of hand. You were not the asshole for excluding her. But you didn\u2019t need to keep putting the laundry up on Facebook. Now, I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t have commented, but I would have kept it to a two line zinger, short and sweet so she wouldn\u2019t have been able to gloss over it.

Honestly ashamed it took so long but I lived in Texas for a while where that\u2019s super normalized. Not an excuse, just an explanation. My family also used a swear in Spanish as an equivalent to damn it and it was really a slur against gay people.
