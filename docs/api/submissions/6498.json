This year, my dad was recovering from a surgery, so I offered to host at my new house, which I share with my girlfriend.  \n\nWhen I was planning the party, I at first didn't really know what to do about my aunt Marie. She's always been pretty homophobic, she'd always be talking shit about \"the gays\" when I was a kid before she knew. \n\nWhen I came out in my 20s she becaume really frosty to me and basically stopped talking to me. \n\nSo when I was planning the Christmas party, there was no way I was exclusing my girlfriend who's estranged from her own family, or putting her in a situation she has to face more bigotry. I also didn't really want to have my aunt over for my own sake, like I'm more used to it but it still makes stuff tense. And it was my own damn house. So I ended up inviting all the family except my aunt.\n\nMy dad angrily confronted me about it, and I basically told him that I know he never allows someone who'd disrespects him or his wife into his home. Now I'm not a kid anymore - I'm as old as he was when he became a parent, I own my own home, and I'm going to be handling my household the way he raised me to, with respect for myself and my partner. \n\nHe actually apologized for putting me in an uncomfortable spot when I was young. He planned a Christmas Day dinner with her and their other siblings. \n\nThe Christmas eve party itself was lovely. \n\nWell, on Christmas day, my aunt posted this lengthy rant about how young people are \"cancelling Christmas\" and about her \"woke\" niece. It was super long and super out of touch, like there's no big conspiracy to cancel family or whatever, I just personally didn't want her there. \n\nI replied \"I assume this is about me not inviting you to the Christmas Eve party? Honestly, the holidays weren't cancelled, I just didn't invite you personally, as you have expressed hateful views towards me such as (i wrote a long bulleted list that is taking this way over the word limit here but some of the stuff on it was stuff like being glad aids kiled a lot of (f slur))\n\nI said \"Anyway, since I'm a lesbian and I share my home with my girlfriend, I specifically uninvited you due to your behavior towards me in the past.

Even a dm with the list that doesnt put it on blast for the whole family is maybe more appropriate? I feel like she likely posted it to elicit a response and then be able to turn around and say see? She is out to get me. (Which obviously she's done things to warrant such treatment, but she's trying to get pity and likely turn the family to her side.)\n\nIt's hard, but it's better in the long run to avoid the facebook drama, that is sort of the ESH part since stooping to her level can almost serve to reinforce and validate whatever bullshit she's spewing in a public forum.\n\nBut at the end of the day, hopefully she just leaves you alone and can reflect a bit on what an asshole she's been in the past.

How is it ok for her to call you out but you\u2019re not allowed to reply? What is it with the older generations being the only ones who are allowed to have feelings AND express them?", "NTA. Good on you for shining a light on all her dirt. Some of your family obviously needed the reminder.\n\nIf she were my aunt, I wouldn't have invited her either \u2014 not only don't I want that in my life, I'm going to protect the LGBTQ neibling(s).", "NTA. If they don't want to be 'judge' on social media, don't post about it. She was asking for it, you just politely told her why she was not welcome at your home. I personally won't invite next year or for future events the ones are saying you took it to far, especially the ones that are defending her for the stuff she said before you came out. Like what? That was ok only because you were 'normal' back then and now are gay? That's so wrong on so many levels.", "NTA, You are never an asshole for making bigots uncomfortable. They should be made as aware as possible that their views are gross, unkind nonsense that makes people not want to be around them.", "NTA", "Slow clap. NTA. In fact, you are an inspiration.", "NTA.

Not even a little bit.", "NTA\nShe made her bullshit public and you just made how she really is public-er.\nGood on you for standing up for yourself and your partner", "NTA. So the enabling fam bam is mad you for rightfully calling out your bigoted aunt? Baby, the trash has truly taken itself out. I'd send a mass text to those lovely, enabling family members clutching their invisible damn pearls that they're being blocked for being very ok with shitty aunt's shitty behavior.", "NTA. Keep track of who is defending her or coming at you in her honor, those are the ones who feel the same way she does but just keep it hidden.", "NTA and I love that you stood up for yourself.", "NTA, you are a LEGEND. love it.", "NTA!  I'm proud of you and your Aunt is a trash person.", "NTA\n\nShe made it public, and you corrected it..\n\nI'm so sick of people defending schitt heads for the sake of \"keeping the peace\".\n\nYou are not the arsehole.. No damn way, and any family or friend who defends who is worth keeping a distance from  too.", "NTA. Could be deja vu but I swear I've read this post before", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, it MIGHT have been shitty of you to \"list homophobic stuff she said before she knew I was gay\" IF and only IF she had worked on herself and become less homophobic/more tolerant in the years since then.

Thanks!", "There is a certain sunset of the population that doesn't feel compassion for people unless it's someone they personally know and care about. Not naming names, or political parties, but it's a pretty well understood situation.", "Without giving itemized details, she'd be accused of overreacting.

But pulling the whole \"well you can't hold that against her, she didn't know you were gay.\" card is just fucking ugly... she still feels the dame way, she's still outwardly hateful, she's still incredibly homophobic and her \"not knowing OP was gay\" doesn't change the fact they were horrible fucking things to say... even if OP wasn't gay, they still would have been horrible things to say. The ARE STILL horrible things to say OR THINK. They're just terribly nasty opinions that make her a terribly nasty person. How can you even try and defend that? \n\nI mean, it would have been more TACTFUL for OP to not have listed all the grievances individually, at length, all at once. But uhhhh... the Aunt hasn't exactly shown any tact herself so probably wouldn't have recognized the tact anyway.\n\nI personally think a shorter, more direct response would have been more impactful as it would feel less emotionally grudge induced.

Your aunt did.", "But it was a different time and that\u2019s just how she is and she didn\u2019t know it\u2019d be personal for you/s\n\nSame excuses we hear all the time.

She thought guilt tripping and making herself\nThe victim would get her sympathy.\n\nYou just told exactly why she was not invited.\n\nIf her comments were too hurtful to be posted online than why were they fine to be said in front of a child?\n\nNTA- they\u2019re just uncomfortable because they know they let it slide, they let her do this because they didn\u2019t know it was personal for someone they love and calling out her for her actions and words also calls them out for their inaction and tacit acceptance of her hate.\n\nThey\u2019re not mad at you for calling her out; they\u2019re mad because\nYou calling her out makes them see exactly what they allowed you to be subjected to for 2 decades.\n\nNTA and hope your holidays were wonderful", "NTA and I fucking love you for standing up for yourself and your partner.", "Girl I bet that was totally cathartic after dealing with her shit for so long.
