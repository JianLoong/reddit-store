This year, my dad was recovering from a surgery, so I offered to host at my new house, which I share with my girlfriend.  \n\nWhen I was planning the party, I at first didn't really know what to do about my aunt Marie. She's always been pretty homophobic, she'd always be talking shit about \"the gays\" when I was a kid before she knew. \n\nWhen I came out in my 20s she becaume really frosty to me and basically stopped talking to me. \n\nSo when I was planning the Christmas party, there was no way I was exclusing my girlfriend who's estranged from her own family, or putting her in a situation she has to face more bigotry. I also didn't really want to have my aunt over for my own sake, like I'm more used to it but it still makes stuff tense. And it was my own damn house. So I ended up inviting all the family except my aunt.\n\nMy dad angrily confronted me about it, and I basically told him that I know he never allows someone who'd disrespects him or his wife into his home. Now I'm not a kid anymore - I'm as old as he was when he became a parent, I own my own home, and I'm going to be handling my household the way he raised me to, with respect for myself and my partner. \n\nHe actually apologized for putting me in an uncomfortable spot when I was young. He planned a Christmas Day dinner with her and their other siblings. \n\nThe Christmas eve party itself was lovely. \n\nWell, on Christmas day, my aunt posted this lengthy rant about how young people are \"cancelling Christmas\" and about her \"woke\" niece. It was super long and super out of touch, like there's no big conspiracy to cancel family or whatever, I just personally didn't want her there. \n\nI replied \"I assume this is about me not inviting you to the Christmas Eve party? Honestly, the holidays weren't cancelled, I just didn't invite you personally, as you have expressed hateful views towards me such as (i wrote a long bulleted list that is taking this way over the word limit here but some of the stuff on it was stuff like being glad aids kiled a lot of (f slur))\n\nI said \"Anyway, since I'm a lesbian and I share my home with my girlfriend, I specifically uninvited you due to your behavior towards me in the past.

She is out to get me. (Which obviously she's done things to warrant such treatment, but she's trying to get pity and likely turn the family to her side.)\n\nIt's hard, but it's better in the long run to avoid the facebook drama, that is sort of the ESH part since stooping to her level can almost serve to reinforce and validate whatever bullshit she's spewing in a public forum.\n\nBut at the end of the day, hopefully she just leaves you alone and can reflect a bit on what an asshole she's been in the past.

The only redeeming feature of this is that it gives everyone else an immediate platform to refute the post. \n\nShe did/you did. \n\nNTA\n\nWhat's the Reddit maxim? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Congrats, aunt! You won!\n\nEdit: also f\\*\\*\\* around and find out. She did that, too.", "NTA. Had i similar but not so much experience with my family. My sister's bf called my brother's gf ugly behind her back so I told her about it. The catch is the bf is ugly af and I'm not the only one who shares that opinion. Now my sister is furious and if I continue like this I'll end up in a sad and lonely life... So in return I told her the truth that nobody in the family like her bf and gave some valid reasons why he's a dick.", "NTA. So your family thinks you\u2019re wrong for standing up for yourself? Nope. If aunt is gonna post it to Facebook then she\u2019d better be prepared for replies.", "NTA.\n\nFacebook is a place where you can share your opinion with people you chose. If someone has a problem with your right to express yourself, then it their problem, not yours.", "[removed]", "NTA. The end. Since no one in your family has your back, you gotta have your own back. It\u2019s also always great when you protect and defend your partner. I wish I knew you. I\u2019m glad you responded to her asinine post.", "NTA\nThough she will try to guilt trip u, watch out for that.\nI can imagine the hilarious comment. Lol", "I'd add that on as another comment, \"seems like other family (list names) feel the homophobia is okay and I went too far. Aunt should not have posted this if her and family didn't want these views in public\"", "You're a good mom and this is well-said!", "And... it was ok when she thought she was being homophobic with no gay people around??", "Family is getting second hand embarrassment, but not for you. \ud83d\ude2c you know when someone is called and out you empathize with them a little bit and that makes you uncomfortable. The drama will die out anyway, but you being a \"firebrand\" is forever and that what's important. I am learning to put boundaries and call out bigotry just now in my 30's, and it's also very messy with my family. But I regret not doing it sooner.", "Your dad sounds awesome and so do you.", "They are shocked because they have to acknowledge the issue they did nothing to stop when you were younger, they have to deal with their own issues surrounding it as well. Still no your problem! I wish the best for you and your girlfriend.", "Shut up. You got big ones, babe. \n\nNTA.", "Or not where everyone had to take responsibility for seeing and hearing it!! Honestly the whole family are AHs for tolerating this before, and they're just embarrassing that this is getting exposed.", "I\u2019m impressed you keep calling him out!", "In NZ one of our charitable trusts called Rainbow Youth made some radio and TV ads called \"If its not gay, then it's not gay\"\n\nhttps://fb.watch/hScdUMUgYA/\n\nSo great \ud83d\ude01", "Your Dad sounds amazing and you, your Mum and he were meant for each other (in the most wonderful way \u2764\ufe0f).", "lmao.

They\u2019ve both thanked me several times over the years for that chat.  When we know better we do better.\n\nRecently one of those sons had to have a heartbreaking chat with his 4 year old because his ex and her new baby daddy like to use such language in front of her and she repeated it in front of my son - as 4 year olds do.  Poor little baby isn\u2019t even in big school yet.", "Honestly, part of growing into a better person is coming to terms with your earlier shortcomings. To everyone who knows me, I'm 'that feminist girl', but as a teen, I was the most hateful misogynist, a pick me and a not-like-the-other-girls. I hate that about me, but it also shows how much I've learned. But I guess it takes courage to openly distance yourself from your past like that.", "Has your father ever confronted his sister about what she has said? He knows now how hurtful it must have been for you to hear, right? Right? Why isn't your father calling her out on Facebook? Why is he carrying on a normal relationship with her in the years since?

And your family members giving you grief because of your response are angry because not only are you publicizing her homophobia, you are also exposing their tolerance and enabling of homophobia by overlooking what she has done. The fact is, once she said those things and especially after you came out, your parents should have prohibited her from the home and your other family members should have called her out.", "Why do people think they get a pass for saying hateful things about a certain group \u201cbefore they knew someone was part of that group\u201d?\n\nWould she expect a pass for being racist \u201cbefore she knew\u201d an acquaintance\u2019s partner was black, or before she knew a coworker was  mixed race?\n\nNTA", "People are cool with it until the world finds out.

Shame the aunt doesn\u2019t seem to have grown at all, and the rest of the family are avoiding the topic. I do feel for younger generations now with everything online captured. I\u2019m sure I said some shit as a kid I\u2019d not say now, but you see people whose careers are lost because they made a stupid joke on twitter when they were 13. Discrimination of any sort is never acceptable, but it\u2019s also kinda sad to be in a world where personal growth is stunted because you\u2019re forever tied to your past mistakes, even if they don\u2019t reflect who you are now", "Not only did she say that stuff, I suspect that a lot of the people complaining to OP were standing there at one time or another, and didn't say a word to her.\n\nPassive acceptance of bigotry promotes bigotry.

It\u2019s called a phobia because people are afraid of something the don\u2019t know or understand. If a family member comes out, it\u2019s possible that their view changes because they now understand that the fear is unwarranted. I have 2 family members in same sex relationships. I used to laugh at gay jokes. I don\u2019t anymore because I know it hurts, and I see the love in these relationships.
