This year, my dad was recovering from a surgery, so I offered to host at my new house, which I share with my girlfriend.  \n\nWhen I was planning the party, I at first didn't really know what to do about my aunt Marie. She's always been pretty homophobic, she'd always be talking shit about \"the gays\" when I was a kid before she knew. \n\nWhen I came out in my 20s she becaume really frosty to me and basically stopped talking to me. \n\nSo when I was planning the Christmas party, there was no way I was exclusing my girlfriend who's estranged from her own family, or putting her in a situation she has to face more bigotry. I also didn't really want to have my aunt over for my own sake, like I'm more used to it but it still makes stuff tense. And it was my own damn house. So I ended up inviting all the family except my aunt.\n\nMy dad angrily confronted me about it, and I basically told him that I know he never allows someone who'd disrespects him or his wife into his home. Now I'm not a kid anymore - I'm as old as he was when he became a parent, I own my own home, and I'm going to be handling my household the way he raised me to, with respect for myself and my partner. \n\nHe actually apologized for putting me in an uncomfortable spot when I was young. He planned a Christmas Day dinner with her and their other siblings. \n\nThe Christmas eve party itself was lovely. \n\nWell, on Christmas day, my aunt posted this lengthy rant about how young people are \"cancelling Christmas\" and about her \"woke\" niece. It was super long and super out of touch, like there's no big conspiracy to cancel family or whatever, I just personally didn't want her there. \n\nI replied \"I assume this is about me not inviting you to the Christmas Eve party? Honestly, the holidays weren't cancelled, I just didn't invite you personally, as you have expressed hateful views towards me such as (i wrote a long bulleted list that is taking this way over the word limit here but some of the stuff on it was stuff like being glad aids kiled a lot of (f slur))\n\nI said \"Anyway, since I'm a lesbian and I share my home with my girlfriend, I specifically uninvited you due to your behavior towards me in the past.

If she wants to trash talk you in social media for petty reasons, she should expect you to do the same with actually good reasons and give her a good explanation on why you don't want her homophobic ass in your party.

Even a dm with the list that doesnt put it on blast for the whole family is maybe more appropriate? I feel like she likely posted it to elicit a response and then be able to turn around and say see? She is out to get me. (Which obviously she's done things to warrant such treatment, but she's trying to get pity and likely turn the family to her side.)\n\nIt's hard, but it's better in the long run to avoid the facebook drama, that is sort of the ESH part since stooping to her level can almost serve to reinforce and validate whatever bullshit she's spewing in a public forum.\n\nBut at the end of the day, hopefully she just leaves you alone and can reflect a bit on what an asshole she's been in the past.

Like especially if anyone's thinking, shit I made some jokes myself. \n\nFor what it's worth, I don't hold grudges over jokes. Hell, as a preteen I even used gay as an insult until I realized I was gay and that skme of my friends at school were too. Then we all pretty quickly realized that's actually kinda hurtful. So I don't get mad if someone made some dumb choices back at a time where those jokes were common. \n\nI just hate the actual serious hateful shit... But I can see how a lot of my family could be feeling worried or maybe attacked too?", "Oh there is definitely some \"this is making our family look bad\" dynamic here too. This is why this topic is not black and white even though it is black and white. People cover up despicable stuff like r*pe and in**st in order to \"not tarnish the family name\", so you publicly calling their sister out is a huge factor. \n\nDoesn't change anything though. She did it in thr first place. They shouldnt be embarassed that she got called out, they should be embarrassed that she said this shit and they all enabled her."]}
