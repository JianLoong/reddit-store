They did a loooot of noise, like talking and giggling, until really late at night, like 2am, and my bedroom is next to hers so I couldnt sleep, but I said nothing. So I slept late, but at morning she put on really loud music which woke me up. I told her to please stop it so I coild sleep one hour more, but she got mad I asked and started complaining. And I don't know what came over me, why I overreacted like that, I just yelled \"OH MY GOD, I WISH YOU WEREN'T MY SISTER, I HATE YOU\". She said nothing, but then she started crying, and it made me feel so guilty, but I didnt say sorry or anything.\n\nShe told my parents, and they were mad at me ofc, but my big sister is also really mad, telling me I shouldnt have said that, and that I'm a really bad sister. I don't think it's fair, because my little sister is worse than me, but I do feel really guilty because she's younger, and I should have just shut up.
