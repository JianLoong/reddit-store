Mostly because, all my childhood, she would \"bully\" me, telling me how ugly I am everyday, and I would get yelled at by my parents if I said anything to make her stop (they would also yell at me if she did anything wrong, because she would Always blame me, and everyone (mom,dad,big sis) would always take her side since she's young and can do no harm)\n\nAnyways, because of that, I just always let her be mean, it doesn't hurt me as much anymore as when I was a kid anyways. And she also calmed down those last few months, she stopped giving those mean remarks, so it was better, we would just not talk to each other.\n\nBut saturday, a friend of her came to sleep to our home. They did a loooot of noise, like talking and giggling, until really late at night, like 2am, and my bedroom is next to hers so I couldnt sleep, but I said nothing. So I slept late, but at morning she put on really loud music which woke me up. I told her to please stop it so I coild sleep one hour more, but she got mad I asked and started complaining. And I don't know what came over me, why I overreacted like that, I just yelled \"OH MY GOD, I WISH YOU WEREN'T MY SISTER, I HATE YOU\". She said nothing, but then she started crying, and it made me feel so guilty, but I didnt say sorry or anything.\n\nShe told my parents, and they were mad at me ofc, but my big sister is also really mad, telling me I shouldnt have said that, and that I'm a really bad sister. I don't think it's fair, because my little sister is worse than me, but I do feel really guilty because she's younger, and I should have just shut up. And I didn't want to make her cry, I love her even if she's mean, and I feel so bad that I wasn't able to be someone she can like.

They should have disciplined your sister for her treatment of you when she was growing up.", "NTA you were tired and fed up I understand where it came from ( it doesn't make it right )but it is understandable", "She\u2019s 15 and has no consideration for you, if your parents and big sis just expect you to keep all this bottled in then they can pay for therapy to let it out, your sister sounds like a real piece of work, I would\u2019ve said this sooner or shouted at her in the night and then shouted at her when she did the music.

I understand how you feel and people need a wake up call.", "NTA - whilst you should have dealt with it better, everyone has their limits", "The parents are the real AH. If your sister bullied you for years and they did nothing to stop it, they don't get to complain now when you finally snapped. Also your older sister is no better.\n\nMove out asap when you can.", "NTA that the truth hurts is her problem.", "Hard to say. She's a child and this is childish behaviour....and what you said to her is typical of siblings. The whole thing is. \n\nI would lean towards NTA. I wouldn't worry about it OP. Honestly. You didn't do anything wrong.", "Slight ESH but mostly NTA. You shouldn't have said that, but your sister is 15, not 5, and clearly your entire family has a problem with telling her no. She's old enough to treat the other people in her home with respect, including you. I don't know why your whole family seems to think she has to be treated like God's gift.", "Nta. Fucked around. Found out.", "ESH\n\nThere is a limit to everyone and sometimes we say stuff that we don't mean (to be honest, I've said some stuff half-awake that I don't even remember and I'm sure everyone in this thread has suffered from being grumpy for being woken up when tired). However, you're wrong for not apologising. \n\nYour parents are also TA because I bet when you were her age you still were expected to take the higher ground. \n\nYour sister is also TA by proxy, the proxy being your parents. It is probably fair to say she doesn't know any different but 15 is the age where we know what empathy is. \n\nNext time you have an issue, instead of addressing her directly, try going through your parents. \"Could you possibly ask X to turn the music down, I've not slept well, I wanted to let her have fun last night so I didn't fall asleep until they did because of the noise. Thanks for helping\". If they ask why can't you do it yourself, just play dumb and say you are scared to because she gets easily offended and you don't know what to say. If they prompt you to say a specific sentence then say \"Ok, I'll tell you how this goes\". You're bullet proof from here on.", "You should move out", "ESH, but mostly NTA, it seems like your whole family just allows your sister to be a little shit. It sucks that you\u2019re blamed for everything. I\u2019m the youngest, but I couldn\u2019t imagine behaving like your sister. You saying that does suck, but since having a child I know how angry I get when I don\u2019t get to sleep and something interrupts it.

You\u2019re 18- this is the actions of a 12 year old. I get that she\u2019s annoying - you prob are to your big sister too.

She's learnt that she won't be punished for this type of behaviour, so has learnt that it's acceptable. \n\nI'd be careful with the words you use towards her as I feel like the real blame here is on your parents.", "leaning YTA over ESH here because, while you were both mean to each other, (a) she's only 15 and (b) what you did was far crueler than what she did, at least in this instance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
