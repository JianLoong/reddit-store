She\u2019s at 500 in Jan. \n\n35 to 500 is quite a leap and not \u201cslightly\u201d at all. You didn\u2019t wait 4 months to back out, she waited 4 months to pull a fast one. You backed out immediately after. \n\nShe has 2 months now to find a bridesmaid who will be happy to shell that out. \n\nThis one is not on you.", "NTA. It is a despicable idea to want anyone to go into debt just to look pretty in wedding pictures. As for being uninvited, well count yourself lucky. You then don't have to spend money on a gift either. This person is clearly not a friend.", "NTA, she\u2019s being ridiculous.  She had the nerve to ask you to go into debt to be her bridesmaid?  After being told clearly that you were on a budget.  Hell no.  Absolutely not.  Don\u2019t feel even a little bit guilty about telling Bridezilla this isn\u2019t going to work.", "NTA. You stated your budget and circumstances early on and she was made aware of it. She\u2019s acting like a true immature bridezilla. Sorry she\u2019ll be joining the family.", "NTA.\nCompletely unrealistic to give that total price with only 2 weeks notice.\nHair and makeup should be optional, and she basically TRIPLED the price of the dress alone.", "NTA. Not much of a friend if she thinks asking you to go into debt is ok", "NTA. I didn't know until now that bridesmaids were expected to pay. It's the couple's decision whether to add these people to the ceremony. They shouldn't expect to foist significant extra expense on you so late in the process. If they can't find a substitute bridesmaid at the last minute, that's bad, but they have had months to get this together and they have been bad at communication and consultation.", "NTA\n\nThat's expensive and she seems to have no concept of how many monthly expenses that would cover.", "No, YNT. You warneed her that you could not afford much. She  told you costs would be about 35 dollars, and now they turn out to be 500 dollars - that's quite a difference. esoeccially when you already worry about being able to pay for basic things such as rent.", "NTA. When you told her about your employment status and tight budget, she should have asked you if you were comfortable being the bridesmaid or not and been okay with either answer. But people guilt others into it and it's hard to say no even though you know you can't afford it. Expecting someone to go into debt for a one night party that nobody will remember even a few years later anyway is insane. I repeat, NTA lol", "NTA at all. Even if you *hadn't* already expressed that money was a concern, which you did and then she changed the budget, it's unkind of her to force the issue after she knew you couldn't afford it.\n\nWhen my sis got married I bought most of the bridesmaids dresses and she paid for the salon the morning of. Know why? Because we didn't to put anyone in a bad financial situation. Don't fret over your decision.", "NTA\n\nI didn't realise it was expected for the bridesmaid to pay for their own dress in some countries.  \n\nI see it as doing a favour for the bride so she should pay for it.", "I don't know what kind of brain short-circuit some people have when preparing their weddings. You warned her about your delicate situation and she gave you some conditions that could have made it feasible for you\u2026 then, however, she changed them without even telling you, and on top of that she has the nerve to tell you to ask someone else for the money...?\n\nNTA. Definitely.", "NTA, but she may have asked you because of your cousin/aunt/uncle/parents. So if they can foot the bill for you, you should still be willing. But it's bizarre to expect an unemployed 18 year old you don't know very well to spend hundreds of dollars for the thrill of attending your wedding.", "NTA. You told her at the start money was an issue she told you dress would be $35 that then increases substantially along with all the other costs, it is late to pull out but then she should have stated all these costs far earlier.", "NTA.\n\nYou agreed to be a bridesmaid after she assured you that the cost to you would be minimal. She knows you don't have a job, and now the amount she expects you to fork over is more than ten times what she'd led you to believe. Her telling you to borrow money for *her wedding* is very entitled - you should not be going into debt for someone else's wedding. That's ridiculous!\n\nYour cousin's fiance can be upset, but to uninvite you from the wedding is in AH territory.", "NTA at all. You are one of the most sensible people who has posted here. YOUR decision is smart. Her wedding is 1 day and it is her special day not yours.", "NTA Personally I think the couple getting married should foot the bill for these kind of costs. (I know it's not the norm.) On the upside you no longer have to worry about buying a gift or footing part of the bill for the bachelorette party!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly, I\u2019ve been in several weddings and what you\u2019ve been quoted are actually wicked low prices for things. These are reasonable estimates for bridesmaid purchases.

I guess NTA, but you can\u2019t be surprised that the bride is upset that one of her bridesmaids is bailing on her.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised about being uninvited to the wedding either.

This has been customary for decades.", "A lack of planning on her part does not constitute an emergency on your part. Screw her and her overspending irresponsibility. NTA.

And give the wedding she and her guests can afford.", "It's been standard for the dress in middle America since at least the 1960s.

I\u2019ve NEVER heard of a groom or family paying for makeup/hair. That\u2019s typically on the bridesmaid themself, unless the bride gifts it to their bridal party as part of the thank you gift.

Give up rent? Live under a bridge until I gathered enough to rent another apartment? Ok. If i said yes it was because she told me I wasn\u2019t gonna have to pay that much, not because I wanted to back out, she\u2019s still family, but I\u2019m not gonna go broke over some wedding.", "I was in a wedding where the bride gifted me my dress, but similar to you, I had to fly across the country and pay for a hotel for the week of the wedding. She bought my dress as part of bridesmaid gift. But that\u2019s not the norm.", "I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re going back and forth on this. It\u2019s clear you didn\u2019t understand what was expected of you. It sounds like you didn\u2019t factor in any other things like a bachelorette weekend, or ask any questions.
