We don\u2019t have kids. We\u2019re very happy and have good communication. There is one issue that drives me nuts. \n\nWe use a joint account to buy food for us, usually shopping together a few times a month and then one of us picking up things here and there. I cook dinner almost every night and we don\u2019t eat a ton of junk, but occasionally I\u2019ll buy things we both love for a weekend or to just indulge here and there. The issue is that I go to bed on the early side and he stays up late- and goes full ham on any junk food we have around on any given night of the week. I\u2019m talking an entire family size bag of chips and the entire container of queso- gone in one sitting that I was saving for Friday margaritas. I went to make us root beer floats with the quart of ice cream and 2liter of soda and they were gone from shopping 2 days prior. He doesn\u2019t ever replace things, he just gives me a sheepish smile when I ask where the rest of something is knowing that he ate it all.  \n\nSo last night after cleaning up the kitchen from dinner, I put all the candy and chips and anything shelf stable, in a different place where he wouldn\u2019t find them. He went ballistic after I went to bed that all the \u201cgood\u201d food was gone (even though I had just cooked a nice dinner). I told him \u201cwelcome to my world\u201d as this is constantly happening when I go to have anything that\u2019s been purchased! He said I was treating him like a child and I said he was acting like one. I don\u2019t care that he indulges but to literally finish off every bit of something that\u2019s been bought for us both to enjoy is getting really old. It\u2019s not a weight thing or a money thing- I just want him to leave maybe one portion for me or maybe we can enjoy together! So until he can show some will power, I told him I won\u2019t be keeping any junk food around for him to gorge on unless it\u2019s something he\u2019s purchased from his own account. \n\nPart of me thinks this is just funny, which is why I might be the AH- but I just think he needs to figure out how to share, figure out how not to consume the entire lot in one sitting, or figure out how to buy his own treats.", "created_utc": 1689694943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1531x1b/aita_for_hiding_food_from_my_boyfriend/", "score": 435, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not allowed to touch the other one.\u201d The kids will often find the last butterscotch krimpet gone when they were saving it, Thin Mints also have to be clearly labeled with names.

Don\u2019t buy stuff until Saturday morning. 2. Hide the food and ignore his rants. It sounds like #1 won\u2019t work.

Therapy helps so much and the fact that he hides it and waits until youre asleep really further makes me think that he may not have a great relationship with food. \n\nWhen I was struggling with this, it's not that I didn't want to share or had bad willpower, it's that with eating disorders you lose control, and for me I didn't rationally think. It was a way to numb myself emotionally. My body was in fight or flight on a cellular level.

While your joint meals are shared costs, you\u2019re contributing to the costs of a lot of other food that only your boyfriend consumes. I might revise the agreement. The joint funds should be used only for joint meals, with items specifically set aside for that purpose. You each fund and store your own extras.

He's shown you he doesn't care to share, while you have been entirely forgiving for far too long. While what you did was petty, I'm surprised you didn't do it earlier. I totally would have. Expecting your BF to not eat all of your snacks is a bare minimum expectation and the fact he's pushing back on this is weird. If it wasn't a big deal, he should have no problem buying his own snacks since you've gone without for so long. \n\nI have little willpower over junk food. If I bring chips/cookies into the house, someone is going to nosh on them. If it's important I have some, I mark on the bag. If I don't care, I don't say anything. \n\nI have woken up to my partner eating all the potato chips and I want some. \n\nI have found buying the snack portion or kids lunchbox portion things helps some. If I buy the mixed box of chip bags, I can say, \"all X kind are mine, the rest are all yours\" (The box has 3 of my favorite, 6 of one person's favorite, and 6 of another person's favorite) to everyone else in the house and they usually abide. It makes it more apparent you're on a junkfood binge when you have to get back up and go get another bag of chips or packet of a few cookies. It may not be the most cost effective, but it keeps the chips more evenly allocated to all members of the house, which is worth it to us.", "NTA. For stuff that's not shelf-stable, get a locker for it.", "NTA. Your bf is being really selfish to eat everything and not leave any for you. He then doubles down by not properly apologizing and replacing stuff. It\u2019s really ridiculous that he is angry instead of realizing how selfish he has been. \n\nMy wife sometimes goes a little crazy with the snacking. If they are shared snacks that we both like, she\u2019s not supposed to eat the last one. She has never left me without a chocolate chip cookie. If it\u2019s snacks that only she likes, like coconut stuff, she can eat it all. I also get stuff in small bags at her request.", "NTA. Separate finances and buy locked box. Is it ridiculous? Sure, but so is your bf.", "NTA\u2014my wife knows to hide junk food from me because I cannot be trusted. I\u2019m not as bad as your bf, but I\u2019m close.", "Your husband has an eating disorder.", "NTA. Maybe you guys should start buying separate snacks??", "It\u2019s perfectly fair for adults who cohabitate to respect each other\u2019s possessions, food or otherwise. He should really go to the market to replace what he ate, that would be the sensible thing to do. \n\nNTA, but you shouldn\u2019t have to hide food from him like he is a toddler. That\u2019s just not what you should expect from a partner that mature. I sense that he has complex feelings about food and that there is something going on here that he\u2019s not communicating. \n\nI would let him know that if he keeps finishing off all the treats, he\u2019ll be expected to sacrifice his time going to the market to replace them the next morning or you\u2019ll start keeping a different pantry that he\u2019s not invited to use.", "When my dad would visit, I had to hide the am coffee cake under my bed. He would wait until we're all asleep and eat all of it. He was a selfish man with food his entire life", "Gross", "NTA \n\nBut have you seen the YouTube video on the actual portion size? It's a good one lol I'll see if I can find the link \ud83d\ude05\n\nEdit to add: well there's way too many of those type of videos to choose from and to just plunk a link down here.", "*but I just think he needs to figure out how to share, figure out how not to consume the entire lot in one sitting, or figure out how to buy his own treats.*\n\nHe knows how - he expects you to supply him with treats and not say anything when you get nothing. I'd just stop buying them for a while.", "I do the same. Go ahead and hide it. I wouldn't be mad. I'd actually agree with it. Hide it if you wanna save it for later. Leave it out if you don't mind me eating it.", "NTA, I personally wouldn\u2019t put up with this kind of childish behavior. He needs to grow up or get out.", "NTA It drives me CRAZY when I buy food and want to have a snack occasionally and the kids have eaten the whole bag of chips, or whole box of snacks that I bought the day before.", "Well... assuming that this really *is* just the one issue, I'd suggest you stop buying treats out of the shared budget. Things like root beer and ice cream and candy and chips should come out of your personal allowance, and his, and labelled with the person's name.\n\nIf labeling doesn't work, you could each get a lockbox for your own treats, but honestly, at that point I'd be considering couples counseling or moving into my own place.\n\nNTA.", "Buy mini packs of things that have the smaller packs. It might help with a self-control. Don't buy a bag of chips. Buy one of those bags that has 20 bags of small chips in it.. get mini candy bars and stuff like that. It makes it a little easier for him to learn how to be accountable to himself like realizes how many portions he's actually eating.. being reminded that those portions are yours.. It's definitely wasteful and bad on the environment, but it might help him learn how to control himself a little bit more self-discipline around food and then you can smooth over and go back to another transition and get the regular size items again and will hopefully have better self-control or maybe learn to use a bowl instead of bringing the bag with him... Now when you have a pattern of eating, that's out of the ordinary and out of the healthy guidelines that's called disordered eating.. he has a problem. He should really self-reflect and find out where that problem is coming from. Is it scarcity mindset? Did he grow up poor and have a lot of siblings that always got all the good stuff before he got to even sniff the bag because that could be where this is coming from...", "NTA. Honestly I do the same. A packet of Tim tams for me is like one a day. My husband finishes it off in one go and leaves me none. It gets old.", "Couldn\u2019t you put a small amount of junk in a ziplock bag or container and leave it out for your husband?  I know it\u2019s more work but seems like a decent compromise in what you say is otherwise a great relationship.", "NTA. I know this situation. It sucks.", "YTA soft, soft....this is actually pretty funny as you said. \n\nI say, let him enjoy that indulgence.   Sounds like everything else is great.  Just accept it.  Buy enouch snacks for him during the week and enough for the weekend. Explain these are your weekly snacks; please save these for us on the weekend.\n\nIt sounds like you may be monitoring his food intake and that he really doesn't like that.", "This man does not have a healthy relationship  with food. He may not be able to help himself, but dang, how frustrating!", "YTA - if you\u2019re buying groceries from your joint account you don\u2019t get to decide he can\u2019t eat them unless he pays for his own. You basically want him to subsidize your groceries and buy his own. \n\nI suggest buying junk food from each of your own accounts to make this fair. Not just forcing him to purchase junk food from his account while still contributing 50% to yours.", "NTA - That would be so annoying. Dude needs to learn to regulate or he needs to buy extra snacks. My husband can take out an entire bag of chips in one setting, but he also has the foresight to buy like 5 bags of tortilla chips at a time lol.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s just a petty way of going about it.\n\nFood is for eating. Yes there is a mild inconvenience when you think something is there that isn\u2019t, but eventually it was going to get eaten and it\u2019s not necessarily anyone\u2019s responsibility to announce what they\u2019ve eaten to you. There is just nothing inherently unacceptable about eating a bag of chips and dip or a tub of icecream. If you plan on eating something for later, maybe you should tell your boyfriend instead of devising these hare-brained plans and posting here. You said you just wanted him to save stuff - why did you say that AFTER going behind this back? You should start thinking before you act ASAP.", "He sounds like me, and even I'm considerate enough to not eat ALL of everything. And I'm usually high and hell and 'munchy' when I do it. This actually makes me feel better because I feel I eat so much, but still can't touch what your husband is putting down. And I don't eat all, or even most, of things that she likes/wants too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, you're not being unreasonable. His appetite kind of isn't.", "Continue current method or immediately separate into yours & mine bags/containers.", "He has NO willpower when it comes to junk food.", "Is there something wrong with his arms or legs that he can't to buy shit to replace what he bought? No? Well, then...\n\nHard NTA.", "I resemble that comment. This is why I purposefully stay away from junk food outside of when I'm with family and will only buy a single pack of crisps (chips for you americans) or individual cans of drink.", "Based on his reaction to her hiding it, I think this is less of an issue of willpower, and more of a matter of him just not caring about her feelings", "Me either. I ask my hubs to hide things from me. NTA!!", "OP points out early on that they are happy and this is one issue, but this is clearly something that will easily escalate.\n\nThis should have ended completely with \u201cHey, please don\u2019t eat this food.\u201d. Husband\u2019s \u201csheepish smile\u201d shows that he knows good and well that his selfish behavior was bothering OP and he truly just didn\u2019t care.\n\nHis reaction was to go \u201cballistic\u201d. OP can likely expect him to retaliate in one way or another and suddenly this is t a small issue anymore.\n\nNTA.", " This is very doable and it leaves food for the rest of my family. Win, win - apart from my waistline.", "My husband does this and it is terrible for me, because I feel like I have to have some of the junk food right away or I won't get any.  If left to my own devices then I would rather just have a little bit at a time.  I think the best way to handle it is to agree to each buy your own junk food and make it strictly hands off for the other one.", "NTA. My husband is a lot like this. Not all at once, but he goes through snack foods so fast I barely get any. I hide certain things and he knows, including the dried apricots he likes. He learned the hard way after plowing through 5 multi serving bags in about 3 days.", "This is similar to my husband. I don\u2019t snack too often so I\u2019m really disappointed when I do go to have a snack and it\u2019s all gone. I ended up getting baskets for everyone and labeling them. If there\u2019s a bag of chips meant for the family, it will go in my or my kid\u2019s basket because we don\u2019t eat everything up in a day. I will make sure to buy a 2nd of that same item specifically for my husband to eat all for himself. I will typically buy 2 snack items to last him through the week (chips, jerky, whatever). But the other bins are not for him to touch. \n\nHe has complained that the food is meant to get eaten so why should he let it sit there for 5 days. My complaint is that the rest of the household shouldn\u2019t have to gorge themselves on Day 1 to get any of the fun food. We should be able to snack occasionally and still have get a portion. I also just really don\u2019t understand these men (my husband included) that think it\u2019s ok to eat *all* of something. If you\u2019re craving it on day 1, sure have a handful or 3 of chips. But then *leave some for other people*!  OR, replace it! I am the one grocery shopping and why should I have to run to the store *again* because  grown adult can\u2019t share?\n\nI don\u2019t think you should lock up all of the snacks (although maybe continue for a few more days so he really sees what it\u2019s like for you). But I think you should each start buying your own snacks with your individual accounts. And get a separate bin for each of you. No one is allowed to eat the other person\u2019s snacks. No \u201cborrowing\u201d because he won\u2019t replace it (by the time you want it). He can pay for and replace his own stuff as often as he needs. And you can have yours when you\u2019re ready for it. If he ends up still eating your stuff, then start hiding and locking it up (but I guarantee he will go searching for it and eventually find it).", "Your husband is really not much better. Sounds like something that could use therapy. If he\u2019s being given his own entire pie and everything is labelled and he\u2019s STILL stealing other peoples food, that\u2019s ridiculous. You guys make too many excuses for grown adults.", "I mean, yes, he actually can control himself to not eat a voluminous amount of food meant for others. He just chooses not to and you accommodate that.", "To add to this maybe buy extra and label what you are saving for you both. I buy the groceries for the house and buy everyone\u2019s favorite snacks and also food for dinners and everyone is aware what are snacks and what is for a meal or an event like movie night.", "Nothing like normalizing having to treat a grown ass man like a toddler. Healthy", "I am a 40-something grown ass man and I buy my own junk snack food. This is very doable and it leaves food for the rest of my family. Win, win - apart from my waistline.", "Yup, just wanted to add some support for 1) he should be buying his own snacks, 2) he should see a doctor or psychologist because this seems to be pretty constant binge eating, and 3) he is being hugely disrespectful and I\u2019m annoyed for OP that he doesn\u2019t see it as such. NTA.\n\nETA: my spouse doesn\u2019t binge to this extreme, but he does go through snacks faster than I do, so we get separate snacks for things that we both enjoy - e.g., two pints of ice cream rather than one big tub. This is a pricier route which is annoying, but it saves us some frustrations.", "This needs to be higher. Once tempers have cooled, OP and bf need to sit down and discus the situation up until now, as both have seen it, and then agree on steps to take going forward. If they can't, they probably need to set up either couple's counseling or separating. OP is NTA, and things should have been resolved before it got to this point, but the hallmark of a good couple isn't about never having fights--it's about resolving them and moving forward.\n\nOP: There's a really good book called \"7 Steps to Making Marriage Work.\" Highly recommend for couples who want to make it long-term, or deal with their first major conflicts.", "We buy his and hers bags of chips and mines always last daaaaays longer lol", "Be an adult and work it out. If he won't/can't, use separate funds to buy snack foods.", "This is a great idea\u2014separate snacks, everyone clear on whose is whose.", "Didn't SHE also pay into the account? He's eating a disproportionate amount of food out of the account. Also, she's the one doing the physical shopping for it. AND MEAL PLANNING. So he's even more of a greedy selfish lazy asshole.", "She isn't going to eat it all herself, she'll just bring it out in moderation and not a buffet style and eat it together. \n\nAnd to be fair he constantly consumes the entirety of things, she has a good backlog she could imo tap into without any wrongdoing.", "I just can\u2019t ever buy any junk food ever then! Even if we have some treats after dinner on a Friday, I\u2019ll go to bed and he\u2019ll eat the rest of everything. But LOL at hungry hungry hippos!", "But the thing is she\u2019s buying this stuff from their joint account, but he isn\u2019t splitting the food, he\u2019s eating it whole. She made a compromise and said that he can obviously still have those things but if he isn\u2019t going to share why should she be paying for half of it when he can pay for it himself", "Lol if the shoe fits. He is 40 if he doesn't want to be treated like a child he shouldn't be behaving like one.", "Emphasis on PART. \n\n\nOP: NTA.", "except it's not \"his\" food? It's both of theirs, bought with grocery money. How is it okay for him to eat all the food, preventing her from getting any at all, but not okay for her to hide it so they can share it together later?\n\nHonestly the whole thing is a bit silly and OP seems to see the humor in it too, so they'll probably figure it out.", "She is hiding her food because he can't leave her half of things alone. She is buying that stuff and cooking for him. And he thanks her by eating her portions of the treats. Absolutely she can hide that shit. If he wants more, though shit, maybe he should learn to share or buy the things he wants himself. He is 40 shouldn't be that hard for him to go into a grocery store and buy his own stuff.", "Me too but so does my partner which is why I have the manners and grace not to dig in to the shared snacks all by myself while he's not around.

It would be gone by sunrise. \n\nOP - NTA. He needs to learn some self control.", "I agree. I occasionally eat something that was meant to be shared - sometimes you just need to eat half a pack of chocolate hobnobs in one sitting - but if it was something for both of us I will replace it.
