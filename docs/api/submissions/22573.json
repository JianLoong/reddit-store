We don\u2019t have kids. We\u2019re very happy and have good communication. There is one issue that drives me nuts. \n\nWe use a joint account to buy food for us, usually shopping together a few times a month and then one of us picking up things here and there. I cook dinner almost every night and we don\u2019t eat a ton of junk, but occasionally I\u2019ll buy things we both love for a weekend or to just indulge here and there. The issue is that I go to bed on the early side and he stays up late- and goes full ham on any junk food we have around on any given night of the week. I\u2019m talking an entire family size bag of chips and the entire container of queso- gone in one sitting that I was saving for Friday margaritas. I went to make us root beer floats with the quart of ice cream and 2liter of soda and they were gone from shopping 2 days prior. He doesn\u2019t ever replace things, he just gives me a sheepish smile when I ask where the rest of something is knowing that he ate it all.  \n\nSo last night after cleaning up the kitchen from dinner, I put all the candy and chips and anything shelf stable, in a different place where he wouldn\u2019t find them. He went ballistic after I went to bed that all the \u201cgood\u201d food was gone (even though I had just cooked a nice dinner). I told him \u201cwelcome to my world\u201d as this is constantly happening when I go to have anything that\u2019s been purchased! He said I was treating him like a child and I said he was acting like one. I don\u2019t care that he indulges but to literally finish off every bit of something that\u2019s been bought for us both to enjoy is getting really old. It\u2019s not a weight thing or a money thing- I just want him to leave maybe one portion for me or maybe we can enjoy together! So until he can show some will power, I told him I won\u2019t be keeping any junk food around for him to gorge on unless it\u2019s something he\u2019s purchased from his own account. \n\nPart of me thinks this is just funny, which is why I might be the AH- but I just think he needs to figure out how to share, figure out how not to consume the entire lot in one sitting, or figure out how to buy his own treats.", "created_utc": 1689694943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1531x1b/aita_for_hiding_food_from_my_boyfriend/", "score": 4599, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not allowed to touch the other one.\u201d The kids will often find the last butterscotch krimpet gone when they were saving it, Thin Mints also have to be clearly labeled with names.

Don\u2019t buy stuff until Saturday morning. 2. Hide the food and ignore his rants. It sounds like #1 won\u2019t work.

Therapy helps so much and the fact that he hides it and waits until youre asleep really further makes me think that he may not have a great relationship with food. \n\nWhen I was struggling with this, it's not that I didn't want to share or had bad willpower, it's that with eating disorders you lose control, and for me I didn't rationally think. It was a way to numb myself emotionally. My body was in fight or flight on a cellular level.

While your joint meals are shared costs, you\u2019re contributing to the costs of a lot of other food that only your boyfriend consumes. I might revise the agreement. The joint funds should be used only for joint meals, with items specifically set aside for that purpose. You each fund and store your own extras. OR\u2026you and your bf need to do all your meal planning and shopping together so it\u2019s much more clear what snacks are available for him versus off limits.", "NTA. He's shown you he doesn't care to share, while you have been entirely forgiving for far too long. While what you did was petty, I'm surprised you didn't do it earlier. I totally would have. Expecting your BF to not eat all of your snacks is a bare minimum expectation and the fact he's pushing back on this is weird. If it wasn't a big deal, he should have no problem buying his own snacks since you've gone without for so long. \n\nI have little willpower over junk food. If I bring chips/cookies into the house, someone is going to nosh on them. If it's important I have some, I mark on the bag. If I don't care, I don't say anything. \n\nI have woken up to my partner eating all the potato chips and I want some. \n\nI have found buying the snack portion or kids lunchbox portion things helps some. If I buy the mixed box of chip bags, I can say, \"all X kind are mine, the rest are all yours\" (The box has 3 of my favorite, 6 of one person's favorite, and 6 of another person's favorite) to everyone else in the house and they usually abide. It makes it more apparent you're on a junkfood binge when you have to get back up and go get another bag of chips or packet of a few cookies. It may not be the most cost effective, but it keeps the chips more evenly allocated to all members of the house, which is worth it to us.", "NTA. For stuff that's not shelf-stable, get a locker for it.", "NTA. Your bf is being really selfish to eat everything and not leave any for you.

I had binge eating disorder (symptom free finally) and my guess is he feels shameful for overeating and rather than process his actions and gain awareness he is lashing out. Given the amount of food he is consuming it sounds like he may have symptoms of binge eating even if he at a healthy weight. I recall hearing the definition of a binge is losing control and consuming around 1000+ calories in a short span of time (imo this is kinda rigid and loss of control is what I use as a barometer for myself).

He'll live.", "NTA\n\nDefinitely some disordered eating patterns here if this is happening constantly. If it's not a health, weight, or money issue, then the grocery budget will just have to be increased and a shit ton more snacks purchased.

Really bugs me when he sneaks my muffins as they're a time investment to make and wrap up to freeze. You have to toast the oats, grind it in a blender, chop pecans and dried cranberries or cherries, then, since I use silicon cups to eliminate greasing the pan, those must be washed.  Pita to fix. He can eat whatever he wants so why my muffins?  He could bake some occasionally but all he cooks is his stinking bacon and eggs and hash browns then stuffs his face while I smell that dang bacon and starve.

And yet they're still filled only in half, the other half being an air. I can easily eat that bag alone in less than 45 minutes (before tv show ends). So thats one thing, dont shame anyone for it, since its not that hard/bad.\n\n- the other thing is that even tho i can eat that bag without issues, i always share, especially when its for a movie nights with somebody. So thats where its his fault, not that he eat the whole bag, but that he doesnt share. My girlfriend dont eat much, so we always grab one big bag, put the chips in a bowl and its fine, it lasts whole movie or at least most of it. While on \"boys nights\" with my friends we buy many different bags and everyone grabs whatever they want, and the 4 of us can easily eat through 10 bags per night (with drinking beer, laughing, playing games you kinda dont even notice it). The point being: sharing is caring. Even tho i can eat 2 or 3 bags on boys nights, i do it only because we always prepare plenty and everyone can eat till we all are full xD. Think about it, maybe the easiest solution is to buy 2 bags, so each of you have your own? Or maybe the issue is not that he eats the whole bag, but that he eats it without you?\n\n- but at the same time hiding stuff is... childish. Why not just talk? There's many different avenues to explore. Did you ever tried to tell him to leave something/that you bought something for friday evening? Nobody sits in your head, so you might have planned to use XYZ in 3 days, but without communicating that, how is he supposed to know? Especially stuff thats \"common\" in your house. My gf for example make pizza with salami. We have salami every other week, and for most of the time nobody cares who eats it. But whenever she plans to use it for pizza, she always tell me, so i wont eat it and ruin her plan. And i do the same whenever i cook something. Once i didnt told her that i need that carton of milk for baking and well, in few days she used most of it for cereal in mornings. I wasnt mad or anything, because it was my fault, i forgotten to tell her xD.\n\nTo sum it up: stop hiding stuff, just sit down with him, and talk about the situation. DONT attack him, dont come across as too strong, be polite, remember that you love him, say that to him. And then tell him that you dont like this situation, that it makes you feel sad/whatever you're feeling, and ask him if maybe both you could have some protocol about this. What protocol? Thats up to you. Think about it for a while, you know your needs. \n\nMe and my gf have an unwritten protocol that each of us buy our own snacks/sweeties, and when we want to share (we always do :p), then the person who bought it, opens it and share with the other. Gf knows that i love white chocolate and she often buys it to spoil me, but i never opened her chocolate on my own, even tho she probably wouldnt be mad, because she's clearly buying this for me (its not that she doesnt like it, its just far from her favourite). But, when it comes to food, we just talk. \"Hey, please dont eat tomatoes, i need them.\", and answer \"Okay honey\". And thats it. I'm not saying its the best solution, but its the best for us, you have to find whats the best for you.

I'd say give him a dedicated space in pantry or a cabinet, but the honest truth is that he'll still eat all the rest of your favorites after he eats his own stash, unless you lock them up.

To be fair, mine had a childhood where his mom was often negligent with him so it was nothing for him to eat a full box of little debbie cookies because his mom forgot to feed him. That was 30-35 years ago and we're food stable now.. it still drives me insane.. NTA", "You're not T A for wanting your fair share.\n\nHowever, junk food is bought from the joint account and should therefore be out for either of you to eat. IMO, you should either quit buying junk food off of your joint account or buy very little. The rest of the junk food should be bought using individual funds.", "YTA but only because I have a different perspective and I know how this went down in my own family, please if you see this read all the way through!!!! My parents have this problem, and my mother solved it the way you did. Expect while you guys don't have kids my parents obvi did and so I grew up in a home where I learned to hunt dig and scavenge for candy because it was hidden and then when I found it I would snarf it all down or use it as a bargaining chip against my dad. This did serious damage to my own ability to develop will power and food restraint and now as an adult I really struggle with sugar consumption and junk food portion control. This is now something my own bf and I deal with and that is why we explicitly chose NOT to hide the food because it creates a scarcity/hoarding mindset. When you hide food you make finding it and eating it a goal which has the opposite effect that you want. He won't learn will power, it will only become a game. If you want him to learn, he has to want to learn. Can lead a horse to water but ya can't make him drink.\n\nAs for how I am working on this issue myself:\n\n\\- I am in charge of my own junk food purchases. I don't eat the junk food my bf's picked (at least without permission, sometimes he has something and it looks delicious and so I ask. If he says yes then I have a bit, if he says no then I don't. Vise versa for him as well with mine). This means when I go to the store I am the one deciding what treats I want to put in my body. This teaches me control as opposed to having the junk just show up in my cupboard and respect for other's food. \n\n\\- Secondly, when I get home, I set a few goals with myself about how long I want something to last based on a lose meal plan for the week. Sometimes I want chips for dinner so I'll plan to eat a lot, but if I know we have pre-set dinner plans in place then I decided okay my goal is to have this bag last until next week.\n\n\\- Occasionally I practice putting the snack in its own container to eat or proportioning rather than bringing the whole tub/bag with me to sit.\n\n\\- I let my bf know when I want help portioning food but most importantly *I let him know when I \\*don't\\* want his help*. I find it condescending to hear things like \"Are you sure you want to eat that all right now?\" and then I get angry and want to eat the whole bag out of spite. Not a healthy mindset at all, but while I work on that separate issue it's helpful to be able to tell him that \"I am not looking for an opinion of help dealing with my bag of chips, I am practicing dealing with this on my own thank you.\"", "I'm sorry! I don't mean to laugh but I know that sheepish smile all too well! My Son & my Husband! And it is frustrating! You go to grab something and it's GONE! \n\nNeither are the asshole but to solve this ...he needs to start buying his own junk food to devour in one sitting!", "this was my question, too.  OP had a lot of expectations, e.g. (A) these chips are to be saved for margarita night, (B) this specific item I bought specifically because I wanted to eat together.\n\nIt's not clear any of these expectations were communicated.", "And doing all the shopping to boot??  What's stopping the snack hog from buying his own treats?", "I've suggested this to my husband for me, but it drives him nuts. I just may go buy one myself.", "It was a good investment as long as they don't buy things like single fingered twix bars which fit through one of the corner railing.....", "I\u2019m diagnosed with BED and that was my first thought too. But usually the person hiding things, is the person with BED, hiding empty wrappers. But when OP described his reaction to \u201csheepishly smile\u201d when she asks about the missing food just reminded me of the shame spirals I\u2019ve been on. \n\nBut I also wonder if OP\u2019s husband smokes pot? Or drinks alcohol? Both lower inhibitions and can lead to overeating.", "You tell the person who did it how it made you feel.", "She did. Many times.", "She says she rolled her eyes and move on. Nowhere does she say she told him how she felt about it.", "I legitimately have huge issues surrounding hiding food stashes because of a childhood and young adulthood of having my food stolen from the fridge/cabinets by my brothers and their friends. At my mom\u2019s house, if it\u2019s in the communal kitchen/fridge, it\u2019s fair game. Doesn\u2019t matter if someone else made it or bought it. Basically anything I didn\u2019t want to disappear and not be replaced, I had to keep in my room. Even now, 15 years later, I keep stashes of certain high value foods and can get pretty territorial and emotional about leftovers. It\u2019s constantly a work in progress. I did not appreciate being raised this way, is all I\u2019m saying.", "I don\u2019t eat packaged snacks often so I hate giant bags of snacks. If I have one I\u2019ll snack on a little bit, put it away, come back in a month and a half and be disappointed that they\u2019re all stale.", "My brother eats like that and is the reason I despise snacks now because it has lead to me having to eat snacks immediatly if I want any....sugar and chips are not tasty when you feel forced to eat them. \ud83d\ude10 \n\nAnyway OP NTA"]}
