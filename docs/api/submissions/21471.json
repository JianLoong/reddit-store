The \"host\" is completely inhospitable, demanding that you be relegated to inferior and uncomfortable sleeping arrangements in order to have the privilege of participating in group events. Why should you feel bad about refusing to agree to those terms?", "NTA you deserve comfort. You even offered to drive home to sleep and they said no.  And they said it bizarrely too -- that's not an option and you won't be able to participate in events.  Really? That's too much.", ">I was told by the host that this was not an option and would not be able to participate in any of the weekend events of I slept in my own bed.\n\nThis is so sus. First no bed for only you, then you're not even allowed to arrange your own accommodation? This feels so deliberate in trying to make you feel unwelcomed. Don't feel horrible for declining, you weren't even welcomed.\n\nNTA. They're TA", "NTA, this is not a friend.  From a woman that is also in her 50's: There will be a couple of people that will be up chatting until the wee hours of the morning after just an hour or two (if that) of sleep the early riser will be making coffee.  If she makes a comment again tell her, you outgrew sleepless slumber parties about 40 years ago when you hit puberty.  Book yourself a massage and facial and have a relaxing weekend.", "Nta.  I\u2019m 54 and have chronic pain, I would never be able to sleep on air mattress or sofa either. Just cite that you can\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t enjoy yourself without decent sleep and you\u2019ll go next time", "NTA. Why would you sleeping at your home make you disqualified from participating at the day events...? For my bachelorette, 3 of 6 bridesmaids slept at their home instead of the air bnb (we were in their home town to be fair). It was slightly annoying (aside from the girl who was a mom) but really didn't bother me much at all and they came to the events during the day without any flack. Host is being ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\n*I feel horrible for declining*\n\nWhy? You were given a shitty and totally unsuitable option that you never signed up for.\n\nYou offered a reasonable compromise (returning to your own house to sleep) that would have inconvenienced no one but yourself, and even that was refused.\n\nLet me guess... the reason they are annoyed is that they now have to split the cost five ways instead of six ways? They expected you to still pay one-sixth of the rental cost in return for getting one-twelfth of fuck all?\n\nTell the lot of them to go jump. Friends don't treat friends like that.", "NTA. By any chance were the other six people actually three couples? There\u2019s often an unspoken assumption in these group vacations that couples deserve private rooms more than singles do.", "NTA. They probably weren't singling you out with the air mattress, they probs just ran out of room, but what is this special event that cannot take place if you sleep an hour away in your own home?", "NTA", "Nta air mattress is torture device when you 50. I know some is pretty comfy but the price is very expensive I don't think it will be the one you will have to sleep in. You even tried to compromise by driving back to home and back I don't know why they not allow you to do this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I personally don't mind sleeping on a couch (and I'm older than you) but can appreciate that you feel you're being singled out and treated as the proverbial second fiddle.", "NTA and WTF....why couldn't you participate with the travel to the venue? Good decision to stay away", "NTA I wouldn't be okay with that. Why did they deny your request to drive home and back?  Did they give a reason?  I'm just curious more than anything because it sounds like a reasonable solution.", "They might really not wanted to include you in the first place - the friends might not be that friendly", "The host has to know sleeping in the couch/floor are unreasonable options and you provided a perfectly logical solution of sleeping at your own home yet they deemed it unacceptable. These are not the actions of good people / friends. I would ask if anyone would be willing to swap with you due your medical requirements. If they refuse I think it goes to show just what kind of people they are as they wouldn't accept the conditions you were offered.", "Thanks for the reply.  I struggle with the balance of being a good friend but true to myself.  I think they were upset that I said no, stood up for myself and yanked my invite to the weekend activities to retaliate.  This has definitely crushed the relationship.", "What is this? House on Haunted Hill?", "Thanks for your reply.  I completely agree with you.", "Ya - makes me sad .", "Love it!", "I think it was a retaliation for me enforcing a boundary and standing up for myself.  It's really pretty sad.", "Thank you for sharing your experience.", "It's a special occasion for the host and I felt bad saying no, but I felt my comfort and dignity were more important.  The relationship is crushed now - but not by my hand.  So sad.", "I was wondering the same.", "The special event was OP's financial contribution for the accommodations", "Thanks for the reply. I completely agree - I had offered to stay late and come back first thing as to not disrupt activities.", "My guess is to retaliate for declining the accommodations.- poor form.", "The host said someone else was going to take the couch  because they were the last to accept the invitation but at the last minute the host decided that I was the last one to accept the invitation ( not true).
