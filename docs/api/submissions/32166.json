{"id": 32166, "submission_id": "188ylb6", "title": "AITA for telling my MIL to stop sending gifts 2 months in advance?", "selftext": "Beginning to feel like the AH on this based on how my family is reacting, but I feel justified. \n\nMy MIL has terrible anxiety. I call her a \u201cfuture tripper\u201d because she\u2019s always worrying about something that will happen in the future and is very vocal to her 4 kids about it, which includes my husband. \n\nOne thing she started doing last year because of her anxiety about the mail being slow is sending gifts 2 months before our birthdays or Christmas. There are 4 of us in our family (me 41f, husband 41m, 2 sons under 10) and we all have birthdays in different months so at any given time, there are gifts waiting in our garage for one of us from her. She buys the gifts on Amazon, so these things usually come 2 days from when she buys them. And it\u2019s been like clockwork 2 months before our birthdays. \n\nThis has been wildly inconvenient for a few reasons. Last year we moved, this year we moved our business and had a lot of stuff we kept in the transition in our garage. This has caused gifts to go missing or us not remembering where we stored the gifts. When we tell her this, she gets anxious and upset and fixates. I\u2019m so over it. \n\nToday she was talking about what my son wanted for his February birthday (because of course we\u2019ve already been sitting on her Christmas gifts since October). I put my foot down and said \u201cLet\u2019s talk about that in the new year. I\u2019d prefer you not to get his birthday gift for us to store for a couple of months.\u201d She got offended and complained that shipping always takes longer than you expect especially if the government is going to shut down (??). I told her even still, I don\u2019t want to be in a position where I\u2019m storing my son\u2019s Christmas gift AND birthday gift for two months from now in my garage. She said she didn\u2019t know what the problem was. I told her it was honestly inconvenient and not necessary when she could even just send something two weeks in advance. She changed the subject then asked my husband to call her when he got home. \n\nHe just told me about his mom feeling offended by what I said and that she was just worried our gifts won\u2019t get to us on time. I told him I was going to cater to this anxiety of hers because it has causes too many issues. I told him it\u2019s ok to push back on some of her anxieties when they are encroaching on others. He doesn\u2019t agree and says she\u2019s old and is just like this. \n\nHe\u2019s a nice guy, so he didn\u2019t call me an asshole, I can tell he thinks it. His sister has been texting me asking if she wanted me to just hold the gifts at her house. I think this is too ridiculous of a response. But AITH?\n\nEdit: Wow, I can\u2019t keep up with the comments but I\u2019ll take my YTA ruling from the majority of the comments. A lot of you thought 1) I\u2019m not grateful for receiving the gifts - which is untrue completely! I was trying to keep this brief and was in a heat of the moment annoyance when I posted. I love my MIL even though some of these small idiosyncrasies drive me nuts. I\u2019m nice and accommodating to her - this was one of the rare times I pushed back on her about the timing of her gift giving NOT the gifts itself. I worry that her family\u2019s response in trying to accommodate her actually enables and worsens the anxiety over time as her coping skills are getting less rational. This is a very minor example of it. \n2) this is a \u201chill I want to die on\u201d - no, it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s one minor situation that came up for me again and I was truly wondering if it was rude of me to ask her not to send things so early. Apparently this one micro situation allowed several of you to deduce I\u2019m a giant heartless and ungrateful asshole. That\u2019s crazy guys. It was wild and a little scary to me to see how intense some of the YTA comments were. If you had legitimately sage advice sandwiched in between vitriol, you were unsuccessful in getting your point across to me. \nUPDATE: I took the advice from one of the earlier comments and spoke to my husband about it this morning apologizing for any affront I made against his mom (I\u2019ll call her later this afternoon and apologize as well) and asked him to be responsible for the management of the early gifts. I know my MIL doesn\u2019t want my kids to open them early because we video chat while they open them (she lives a few states away). As long as I don\u2019t have to worry about where it\u2019s kept (we have a small business that does often overflow into our garage space when we get new shipments). Thanks for the legit helpful perspectives - I got a lot from that, and for you others who are just plain angry, I\u2019m sorry this was such a trigger for you.

If it's just the needlessness of the whole thing that gets to you, then I'd just let it go.

I'd love to have family do that! I get to play an exciting game of guess that the present is for two months!", "YTA - older people become increasingly anxious about day to day living. You are literally going off on one because you don\u2019t want to store gifts for 2 months because it\u2019s inconvenient. So it comes down to your inconvenience versus her anxiety. One is a mental health issue the other is \u2026.. an inconvenience. Grow up.", "NTA. She's trained her kids to accommodate her anxiety rather than set reasonable boundaries.

Unfortunately it seems that her issues are set enough that reasoning won't fix it.\n\nI do like the suggestion from u/Different-Mirror-100 of just opening the gifts when they arrive, as long as she doesn't then feel she has to get another gift for the day. I would get anxious wondering if the item is still returnable if it arrived damaged if the box isn't opened for 2 months, so opening them solves that problem. Opening the gifts right away also can make the event feel longer - first there are grandma's gifts and then later more gifts from everyone else.\n\nYou could try asking for gifts that don't need mailing such as gifting a couple of hours of undivided attention to do an activity together. \n\nNAH", "I'd ask you to honesyly consider whether you'd handle your own mother like that.  It seems like such a small issue relative to your reaction which appears disproportionately large.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like MIL has some sort of anxiety disorder and for her to feel safe and secure, she needs to know that the gifts she's sending are received on time. Now that you're presumably done moving, there's literally no reason that you cannot designate a place to put said presents. Also, why can't you just open the gifts as they come? It makes sense if your child is an actual child and wouldn't understand that this early gift means that they won't recieve a gift on their birthday, but for a tween or teen? Why not? \n\nI personally live on a very fixed income (SSDI) and I will personally buy gifts a month or two out if there's a sale, if I happen to have more money that month, if the delivery date is long (etsy/small business gifts), etc. And they open it when it comes. \n\nLike, would it be better if you didn't recieve any gifts at all since getting them early is such an inconvenience?

Give them to the recipient as soon as they arrive.", "Just give them the gifts as they arrive and tell your mil that is what you\u2019re doing because you cannot store them. When she complains, just repeat yourself. And if she sends another gift, give it to the recipient immediately.", "YTA. Your MIL suffers from anxiety. Yes, you don't have to cater to every issue, but is this one really that bad? Just pick a spot for where gifts go and leave them there. Gosh, I feel bad for your MIL because as she gets older, unfortunately, it just will get worse, and they can't always control it with old age. I saw it with my grandmother. A little kindness and understanding never hurts.", "YTA. Yeah, it\u2019s maybe inconvenient, but she means well, it\u2019s ultimately not harmful, your SIL offered you a solution (one your MIL doesn\u2019t even have to know about).

I know it's annoying that you have had to store them, but I think it is important to remember that it is a gift.  If it were me, I would be annoyed also because I do not have a lot of storage space, and as you described, there would also be a likelihood that the gift would be forgotten. My gratitude foe the gift however would prevent me from complaining about its timeliness (or lack thereof).  I would simply open them as soon as they arrived.    There are no rules preventing opening birthday/holiday gifts early.  You also have the option of your sister in law managing the gifts.

You would have presents at times that the kids won\u2019t receive for a while. How is it any different to the gifts being open and living within your home?\n\nIt\u2019s time to analyse you, not lash out on her. Poor darling is likely fixating on this too now. Mental Health conditions do bleed out onto loved ones - seeking help or not. That\u2019s the beauty of these horrible conditions. Helping someone through them is a small price to pay for love.", "NTA. This is inconvenient for a number of reasons. \n\nYou have 2 kids under 10, so if they stumble upon xmas gifts in the garage, it might raise questions as to why you have them and not Santa or something like that. \n\nThere\u2019s also gonna be limited return windows so if the kids (for any reason) dislike the present, and want/need to return it, they can\u2019t. \n\nAll this in addition to the fact that simply storing them and hiding them for 2+ months just isn\u2019t practical. They\u2019re liable to go missing and/or get damaged, and MIL has shown frustration when this has happened. The solution is just for her to send them maybe a month later.", "I get it, ok. It's annoying to have to store stuff. Especially if you're someone like me that drowned in stuff as a child because the generation above me were  borderline horders that loved stuff. But as annoying as this is, it comes from an anxiety issue. I hope that her kids are actually helping her anxiety instead of just being enablers.

I call her a \u201cfuture tripper\u201d because she\u2019s always worrying about something that will happen in the future and is very vocal to her 4 kids about it, which includes my husband. \n\nOne thing she started doing last year because of her anxiety about the mail being slow is sending gifts 2 months before our birthdays or Christmas. There are 4 of us in our family (me 41f, husband 41m, 2 sons under 10) and we all have birthdays in different months so at any given time, there are gifts waiting in our garage for one of us from her. She buys the gifts on Amazon, so these things usually come 2 days from when she buys them. And it\u2019s been like clockwork 2 months before our birthdays. \n\nThis has been wildly inconvenient for a few reasons. Last year we moved, this year we moved our business and had a lot of stuff we kept in the transition in our garage. This has caused gifts to go missing or us not remembering where we stored the gifts. When we tell her this, she gets anxious and upset and fixates. I\u2019m so over it. \n\nToday she was talking about what my son wanted for his February birthday (because of course we\u2019ve already been sitting on her Christmas gifts since October). I put my foot down and said \u201cLet\u2019s talk about that in the new year. I\u2019d prefer you not to get his birthday gift for us to store for a couple of months.\u201d She got offended and complained that shipping always takes longer than you expect especially if the government is going to shut down (??). I told her even still, I don\u2019t want to be in a position where I\u2019m storing my son\u2019s Christmas gift AND birthday gift for two months from now in my garage. She said she didn\u2019t know what the problem was. I told her it was honestly inconvenient and not necessary when she could even just send something two weeks in advance. She changed the subject then asked my husband to call her when he got home. \n\nHe just told me about his mom feeling offended by what I said and that she was just worried our gifts won\u2019t get to us on time. I told him I was going to cater to this anxiety of hers because it has causes too many issues. I told him it\u2019s ok to push back on some of her anxieties when they are encroaching on others. He doesn\u2019t agree and says she\u2019s old and is just like this. \n\nHe\u2019s a nice guy, so he didn\u2019t call me an asshole, I can tell he thinks it. His sister has been texting me asking if she wanted me to just hold the gifts at her house. I think this is too ridiculous of a response.

This way they don\u2019t get lost.\nOr- sorry. I forgot where I put them so they did didnt get them.\nOr, husband I need you to put these somewhere safe so they don\u2019t get lost. You can remember where you put them, right?\nOr- hey, you know Amazon sends out packages via UPS or FedEx?  The government doesn\u2019t control this, they don\u2019t get delayed.\n\nUpside,  your MIL remembers to send gifts while many of us have MIL\u2019s that never seem to get anything to their kids on time.", "NTA\n\nWhat is the worst that will happen? The mail will fail and the gift will be a little late. Better that than gifts being lost or it being inconvenient to store. MIL needs to manage her hang ups.", "This is a non-issue. Just open the gifts as they arrive and send a Thank you note", "NTA\nIt sounds like Grandma needs an intervention because worrying the government will shut down is a very unusual anxiety.", "ESH\n\nYou're creating a bigger problem than the one at hand. Storing gift boxes for a couple of months isn't/shouldn't be this big of a deal. Sorry, but organize yourself a specific spot for the gifts so they don't get lost. Kind of simple. Not a huge deal. \n\nHusband needs to start managing the gifts though. You definitely sound a little wound up over this and it doesn't seem like you're going to win over anxiety that is older than you are. So, husband gets to receive, store and organize, and retrieve the gifts. \n\nMIL - I don't know how old she is but I'll tell you my 74 year mother will not break her habits, go to therapy, or acknowledge her own anxiety.

That's your husband's mom, let him deal with putting the gifts away and making sure that the kids won't find them and that they'll not get lost or forgotten. I'd pass that responsibility on to him so that he can deal with his mom.", "NTA \n\nI have pretty bad anxiety, I often buy gifts a month or two in advance but store them in my own home. I make sure they arrive where they need to for the birthday by paying for recorded delivery or hand delivering", "Ask your MIL : \"What happens if the gifts are late?\"\n\nPutting things in perspective can often help people with anxiety to see how irrational their fear is. Because anxiety is fear. She fears something if they are late. But there is no reason, you won't like her less if the gifts are late. You won't feel less loved if the gifts are late.\n\nAnd I agree with you that if her anxiety is putting you in a difficult situation, you're allowed to push back and set boundaries.\n\nI'll say NAH because I don't think she's doing this with a mean spirit.", "Yup YTA! Just be grateful she even gets you all a gift. Anxiety can be crippling. Pretty rude on your part.", "NAH I don't think asking her to wait until after the Christmas chaos is over before sending February's gifts is as crazy as she thinks it is.

Like just send the gift two weeks before like everyone else", "I think you two have more in common than you realize. I mean her stressing about late deliveries and you stressing about having to store a few packages. Look, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. This is really not a big deal. \n\nThe first thing I thought reading this is how lucky your sons are to have a grandma that cares so much about getting them a nice gift for birthdays/Christmas. I honestly think that\u2019s sweet. I can actually understand that the packages are a bit of a hassle though. I don\u2019t like clutter so I get that. But the SIL has now even kindly offered to store the packages. Honestly, they sound like nice people \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude05 I\u2019ve had some serious problems with my MIL in the past so to me this just sounds like such a non issue. \n\nUltimately I think NAH, you all just need to get a little more perspective.", "Does she live nearby? Take them to her so she can store them", "NTA\n\nSorry but when someone's mental illness starts affecting other people, they either get help or you take the bull by the horns and fix the problem it's causing.\n\nSolution:  Tell your MIL that your kids are old enough now that they both prefer money.

You sound ungrateful, tbh.", "Plus this way you're within the time limit for sending it back if there's parts missing.\n\nMaybe that can be an argument for grandma though.

The kids will love random early gifts, too.", "Because this will cause a different kind of MIL drama \"Now he wont have a birthday gift, im going to have to get another one\" and then there is both endless complaining AND another gift.", "I agree NAH, but my suggestion would be to remind her that returns can usually only be made within a month. Ask her to order them for delivery two weeks before - that gives two weeks for it to arrive, and two weeks for you guys to return it after the event if there\u2019s a problem with the gift. Hopefully that\u2019ll give her some incentive to change.", "I think this is the best idea. You can even take pics of the kids with the gifts and wait to send them when the holiday arrives", "Agree with NAH. Also, since kids change their minds so much day to day, never mind over months, it's possible they won't even be interested in what she sent.

My husband and I bought our Christmas gifts early this year and packages have been arriving. It is stressing me out to have these boxes scattered around the house and there\u2019s an end date.

Maybe there are my own issues here but OP is allowed to make a reasonable request about her own home.", "I was thinking along the same lines. Yes, it's an inconvenience but it's a luxury inconvenience. You get presents early... So, what? I don't think it's something to start a fight over.", "It's a really simple request to accommodate on her mother-in-law's part. It's not unreasonable at all for her to make that request.", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t complain about this unless she\u2019s sending something giant.  I\u2019d personally just ask that it was small so we had room to store it.\n\nThe other thing I thought was that the MIL might be trying to get things on sale.", "Sending gifts early from another country and the postage system are not even comparable to sending Amazon packages to someone 2 month early, I get she is overreacting a bit but she's definitely NTA.", "There's a huge difference between overseas shipping and amazon though.

Though I would personally order a bit in advance for Christmas, you can definitely do it the week of for random birthdays. \n\nAlso MIL's coping mechanism is to make others deal with what is causing her anxiety. It's not really unjust for OP to feel like now she has to deal with a burden her MIL puts on her on top of dealing with her duties for birthdays and other celebrations. \n\nFrom everything else she says, OP seems to be in over her head, and her husband doesn't seem to help her either.", "She's not sending stuff through customs.", "Your situation seems very different from OP's since you are talking about international mail.", "I don't understand all the Y T A.

Put a bright label on a box or two and then insert and take out presents when needed and forget the whole thing the rest of the time.\n\nIf the MIL was inflicting her anxiety in ways that caused actual issues I could understand, but unless I'm missing something this sounds like OP has been inconvenienced by this when moving in the past a couple of times and has a bee in her bonnet about the issue still even when it is no longer causing any practical problems. The issue seems to be that she doesn't like her MIL being needlessly careful when it isn't really any skin off her nose.\n\nI believe in standing up for yourself when you are actually being put upon, but I am failing to see the real problem here (rightly or wrongly).", "Ordering gifts early isn\u2019t the catastrophe that OP is making it out to be. Gifts sometimes DO arrive late if you wait until December, even using Amazon. Last year there were 3 presents that didn\u2019t make it in time for my sons because USPS was bogged down.

If I need a gift there by a certain tim because of how it makes me feel, that's making the gift about me and my comfort. Which is kind of the opposite of gift giving.

I think she should address the real issue, not focus on a trivial symptom.", "If MIL has severe anxiety I would bet this isn\u2019t the only issue that bleeds into their marriage (ask me how I know?). Personally, I\u2019d probably pick my battles and not focus so much on the gifts (I mean, it\u2019s for your kids) but definitely focus more on this issue right here. If it bothers OP, then let husband own this task and together deal with how MIL\u2019s anxiety is impacting the marriage/family. Anxiety can make people feel like something is an emergency and they expect others to feel that same sense of urgency, too. But there are ways to deal with that.", "If OP is like you, then I can see the issue. Perhaps OP could tell her husband that the storage and management of the presents is entirely his from now on and to leave her out of it unless the gifts are sent just before the event as she would prefer.", "I think most families are like that! I have three kids and both my husband and I work full time. No, I\u2019m not keeping track of packages sitting around my too small house for months. Especially at Christmas, we\u2019ve got a million things to keep track of. If it were me, I\u2019d just open the gifts as soon as they came and then tell my MIL.

I agree with you. Storing them is annoying and the MIL should just not order them so early. \n\nI imagine this woman consumes a lot of conservative media and is constantly told to be afraid and it's leaking into her gift buying habits. Could be wrong but that's the vibe I get.", "Doing something that causes inconvenience for someone else is literally the opposite of being considerate. It might be easy for you to empty out and designate a space for gifts, but clearly it's not that easy for OP due to the amount of space they have, the rhythm and processes of their lives or whatever other reason.", "Good point! That's actually the best possible way to solve the problem as it stands now. \n\nOP and HB both seem like they want to find a solution, and this is a really good way of either OP seeing that it's not that big a deal to someone with the relevant skillset, or HB seeing that it adds a layer of unnecessary hassle to their lives that they shouldn't have to worry about.", "Just open the gifts when they come. She\u2019s the one that chooses to send them early. I think you\u2019re making it into a bigger deal than it is and you can easily find a place to leave them so everyone knows where they are like a whole closet or something. \n\nI would have the person open it when the gift comes and then when she asks about it, you don\u2019t have to say that you opened it so early", "This sounds annoying but unless she\u2019s sending you large sized gifts it sounds like an annoyance that can be managed.  A storage tub in the garages labeled \u201cnans gift\u201d should barely take any space. \n\nGet your husband to take care of the storage or take up your sister in laws offer which honestly seems like a perfect solution as it doesn\u2019t inconvenience you and keeps your MILs anxiety sorted.  \n\nI have no idea of the relationship you have with your MIL but if this is the the worst of it you are very lucky. \n\nThe thing is anxiety can be a real horrible thing.  What may seem ridiculous to you can be a genuine real issue for someone else.  What may be an inconvenience for you may be something that weighs heavily on her.

This isn\u2019t \u201chow she is\u201d this is her illness and her son should be wanting to see her get support and help and regain control of her anxiety not just \u201coh welling\u2026\u201d. *ESPECIALLY* Because this is a new behavior that indicates something is going on/getting worse.  \n\nNTA.

What is she picturing that is so painful to her or to the kids that it must be avoided at all costs?

Does she think that the family will hate her, judge her, attack her, cut her off if she ever misses a gift occasion? She's trying to prevent *something* awful with this, and she can't just knock it off any more than people who survived the Great Depression could stop washing paper towels to re-use and keeping their money out of banks, or any more than somebody who grew up without enough food can stop hoarding it.

They haven\u2019t, though, and the person SIL chose to make this offer to is OP. This means OP is involved in making these arrangements.", "Yes and I just store and organize things well. Storing something for a friend or relative would be the easiest thing imaginable and I would do it without hesitation. Happy to do it. \n\nIt's not a big deal. OP is needlessly turning it into a big deal. Be happy you have a loving family that wants to send you gifts. Life isn't about getting into these petty squabbles.", "Fair enough. I mean she's already involved in trying to get the MIL to stop sending so early. Wouldnt be much more effort to send a text to SIL that says yes, please and one to MIL that says, please start mailing to SIL, but i get your point.", "Friends and relatives aren't necessarily young children in your home who are going to want to open their gift. She's going to keep having to find new spots to keep them hidden so that the kids don't find them"]}
