{"id": 32166, "submission_id": "188ylb6", "title": "AITA for telling my MIL to stop sending gifts 2 months in advance?", "selftext": "Beginning to feel like the AH on this based on how my family is reacting, but I feel justified. \n\nMy MIL has terrible anxiety. I call her a \u201cfuture tripper\u201d because she\u2019s always worrying about something that will happen in the future and is very vocal to her 4 kids about it, which includes my husband. \n\nOne thing she started doing last year because of her anxiety about the mail being slow is sending gifts 2 months before our birthdays or Christmas. There are 4 of us in our family (me 41f, husband 41m, 2 sons under 10) and we all have birthdays in different months so at any given time, there are gifts waiting in our garage for one of us from her. She buys the gifts on Amazon, so these things usually come 2 days from when she buys them. And it\u2019s been like clockwork 2 months before our birthdays. \n\nThis has been wildly inconvenient for a few reasons. Last year we moved, this year we moved our business and had a lot of stuff we kept in the transition in our garage. This has caused gifts to go missing or us not remembering where we stored the gifts. When we tell her this, she gets anxious and upset and fixates. I\u2019m so over it. \n\nToday she was talking about what my son wanted for his February birthday (because of course we\u2019ve already been sitting on her Christmas gifts since October). I put my foot down and said \u201cLet\u2019s talk about that in the new year. I\u2019d prefer you not to get his birthday gift for us to store for a couple of months.\u201d She got offended and complained that shipping always takes longer than you expect especially if the government is going to shut down (??). I told her even still, I don\u2019t want to be in a position where I\u2019m storing my son\u2019s Christmas gift AND birthday gift for two months from now in my garage. She said she didn\u2019t know what the problem was. I told her it was honestly inconvenient and not necessary when she could even just send something two weeks in advance. She changed the subject then asked my husband to call her when he got home. \n\nHe just told me about his mom feeling offended by what I said and that she was just worried our gifts won\u2019t get to us on time. I told him I was going to cater to this anxiety of hers because it has causes too many issues. I told him it\u2019s ok to push back on some of her anxieties when they are encroaching on others. He doesn\u2019t agree and says she\u2019s old and is just like this. \n\nHe\u2019s a nice guy, so he didn\u2019t call me an asshole, I can tell he thinks it. His sister has been texting me asking if she wanted me to just hold the gifts at her house. I think this is too ridiculous of a response.

This would annoy the hell out of me. I don't need to be hanging onto gifts in their boxes for months. The likelihood of misplacing them would be high for me. If she orders from Amazon, they literally let you know the delivery date and honestly, most things arrive in a matter of days. If your mil is annoyed that you lose the things she sends, then she needs to send them at the proper time. \n\nIt's not up to you to manage her anxiety. If it's such a big deal, put your husband in charge of the packages when they arrive. \"Husband, the packages from your mother arrived today. Please take care of them and bring them out in 2 months for the actual right day. Thank you.\" Then you grey rock the whole thing. If something is misplaced or lost, your husband answers to his mother as to what happened.

I think this is too ridiculous of a response.'\n\nI was with you until that last bit-and yes YTA now. Your MiL suffers from anxiety and sends gifts way too far in advance of an event and that winds you up. Fine, I get it-but:\n\nYour SiL seems to understand mom's anxiety and has offered to store the gifts, thus solving all your issues around storage, frustration etc.   The a very kind offer, she's clearly trying to help manage her mom's anxiety and take you our of the equation, so why is it 'too ridiculous of a response'?  That's you being an asshole.", "NAH. Choose your battles. Your kids have a grandma who loves them so much, she sends gifts early. Make your husband deal with the logistics of the gifts.", "Ok, wait.

Now you have moved couldn't you designate one particular space to be where you keep her presents and then only have to place them there and go get them when needed?\n\nDo you not have the space or is it the *idea* that bothers you? If it's just the needlessness of the whole thing that gets to you, then I'd just let it go. You are unlikely to change her mindset and if that is all she does that bothers you the easiest thing is to let go of the issue the moment you place her early gifts in the designated space and box.

She\u2019s constantly telling me about this stuff she finds for my son. I don\u2019t tell her to stop, I just say that\u2019s great and to please let me see the stuff before she brings it to my 3yr old or keep it at your place for when we come over. Most of the stuff she gives us goes back in the bin but she\u2019s never going to stop because she too has anxiety and a gatling of other ailments.\n\nI don\u2019t expect to change her.

You seem controlling. I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t just be grateful she cares enough to pick presents and send them.", "YTA, so you have a box on a shelf somewhere in your garage or closet for a couple of months.  How out of control is your life that you can't handle that?  Seriously you sound way more unhinged than your MIL.", "YTA, how can you forget you put in the garage when that's where you say you always put it? What is the garage the size of a mansion? I'd love to have family do that! I get to play an exciting game of guess that the present is for two months!", "YTA - older people become increasingly anxious about day to day living. You are literally going off on one because you don\u2019t want to store gifts for 2 months because it\u2019s inconvenient. So it comes down to your inconvenience versus her anxiety. One is a mental health issue the other is \u2026.. an inconvenience. Grow up.", "NTA. She's trained her kids to accommodate her anxiety rather than set reasonable boundaries. If your husband isn't willing to set limits he's now in charge of Mom. He gives her the list, he stores and then finds the gifts. Or you give the presents early, as soon as they arrive. Video the kids opening them and let her enjoy the fuss.", "Nah and take.the sister.up to n the offer so it's her problem", "I understand the feeling that if you can just explain well enough, the other person will realize that you are right and the problem will just go away. Unfortunately it seems that her issues are set enough that reasoning won't fix it.\n\nI do like the suggestion from u/Different-Mirror-100 of just opening the gifts when they arrive, as long as she doesn't then feel she has to get another gift for the day. I would get anxious wondering if the item is still returnable if it arrived damaged if the box isn't opened for 2 months, so opening them solves that problem. Opening the gifts right away also can make the event feel longer - first there are grandma's gifts and then later more gifts from everyone else.\n\nYou could try asking for gifts that don't need mailing such as gifting a couple of hours of undivided attention to do an activity together. \n\nNAH", "I'd ask you to honesyly consider whether you'd handle your own mother like that.  It seems like such a small issue relative to your reaction which appears disproportionately large.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like MIL has some sort of anxiety disorder and for her to feel safe and secure, she needs to know that the gifts she's sending are received on time. Now that you're presumably done moving, there's literally no reason that you cannot designate a place to put said presents. Also, why can't you just open the gifts as they come? It makes sense if your child is an actual child and wouldn't understand that this early gift means that they won't recieve a gift on their birthday, but for a tween or teen? Why not? \n\nI personally live on a very fixed income (SSDI) and I will personally buy gifts a month or two out if there's a sale, if I happen to have more money that month, if the delivery date is long (etsy/small business gifts), etc. And they open it when it comes. \n\nLike, would it be better if you didn't recieve any gifts at all since getting them early is such an inconvenience? Because that's pretty much what the alternative is. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, literally.", "Soft YTA this is not a real problem , it\u2019s gifts.", "NTA, a few weeks early is fine but two months is excessive. I honestly don\u2019t see why you continue to store gifts. Give them to the recipient as soon as they arrive.", "Just give them the gifts as they arrive and tell your mil that is what you\u2019re doing because you cannot store them. When she complains, just repeat yourself. And if she sends another gift, give it to the recipient immediately.", "YTA. Your MIL suffers from anxiety. Yes, you don't have to cater to every issue, but is this one really that bad? Just pick a spot for where gifts go and leave them there. Gosh, I feel bad for your MIL because as she gets older, unfortunately, it just will get worse, and they can't always control it with old age. I saw it with my grandmother. A little kindness and understanding never hurts.", "YTA. Yeah, it\u2019s maybe inconvenient, but she means well, it\u2019s ultimately not harmful, your SIL offered you a solution (one your MIL doesn\u2019t even have to know about). She also, from the sound of it, as a real mental health issue and you are calling her a \u2018future tripper.\u2019 That\u2019s so dismissive and awful.", "YTA - \u201cwildly inconvenient\u201d is overkill. It is not hard to have a gift corner or shelf in the garage where you keep stuff her gifts until the designated holiday or birthday. Don\u2019t create a problem where there isn\u2019t one.", "Info: does she live in a different city? Why can't she get the gifts delivered to her place and give them in person.\n\nIt does sound like you're overreacting a bit.", "NTA that would drive me nuts, but also in my case, cause more drama. I can't even remember my own gifts I've hidden away, much less remember two months later. Whenever I clean out my closet I'm like \"oh hey I found christmas presents!\" It's ridiculous.", "YTA - Tell the real truth you really don't like her and that's why it irritates you, if not then you need to have a word with yourself for being so petty over someone doing something nice for you and your kids, it's literally no hardship to store a gift for a couple of months.", "NTA if you don\u2019t want them done then u don\u2019t especially when u gave valid reasons .. 2 weeks is good enough", "YTA Why are you making a mountain out of a molehill ?  \n\nIt's not that hard to store a gift.", "YTA the only way this is inconvenient is if you are a very messy dis-organised person....", "YTA\n\nYou must be a last minute shopper otherwise you already have somewhere you store gifts purchased in advance. Are you shopping for Christmas the week before? Somehow I doubt it. So where are you storing those gifts?\n\nMy husband and I have a closet in his office where early Christmas gifts are stored. \n\nAlso, as someone else mentioned, you could always open the gifts early and send a picture to your MIL on the date when the occasion occurs. \n\nIf you are so troubled by receiving the gifts, talk to your husband about it and if he is troubled too, it should be his responsibility to handle his mother and he is TA. If he\u2019s not troubled by it, and neither are any of the other family members, then why should your MIL be forced to change just for you? If you have other issues with your MIL and this is \u201cthe last straw\u201d then your husband needs to deal with his mother and again, he\u2019s TA.", "YTA. You MIL is clearly struggling with crippling anxiety and fear of disappointing you, obviously suffering a lot because of this, and you are making a big deal of having to store gifts 2 months. She should just stop sending gifts.

She doesn\u2019t live near you, and she wants to make sure you get them without drama and not miss out.   \nStore them in your garage. Leave them in the cardboard boxes and store them somewhere you know to get them from each time. Limit her on size if you must. Remind her garages are hot/cold and dusty so no food.  \n\n\nSoft YTA, because I understand your frustration, but this is dealing with a person with a few mental health quirks by the sounds of it, and flexibility (of mind) is key to maintaining a relationship.

My Mum's aunt already purchased part of my wedding gift (we give cookware as part of our traditions) when I was a child because she didn't know if she would live to see me get married.

It\u2019s hard to store a gift?", "NTA. \n\nThis judgement may partially be because I live somewhere where indoor space is at a premium and there\u2019s barely enough space for your own stuff, but you\u2019re not a storage service. \n\nYou\u2019ve tried her way and have decided that it doesn\u2019t work for you - that should be the end of it.

Like, \"hey we picked up some Christmas presents while we were here, so we left them in the guest room closet.\" \nIt's really no biggy.", "Just wondering, a lot of webshops I use give you the option to pick the delivery date. Isn't that an option? She can still order 2 months in advance, the webshop will put it on the side and deliver it at the required date.

I know it's annoying that you have had to store them, but I think it is important to remember that it is a gift.  If it were me, I would be annoyed also because I do not have a lot of storage space, and as you described, there would also be a likelihood that the gift would be forgotten. My gratitude foe the gift however would prevent me from complaining about its timeliness (or lack thereof).  I would simply open them as soon as they arrived.    There are no rules preventing opening birthday/holiday gifts early.  You also have the option of your sister in law managing the gifts.  If it really is such a hardship, and you don't want to open them early, then this seems like a valid option.    \n\nI would love to have someone who cared about me enough to send gifts.

This is inconvenient for a number of reasons. \n\nYou have 2 kids under 10, so if they stumble upon xmas gifts in the garage, it might raise questions as to why you have them and not Santa or something like that. \n\nThere\u2019s also gonna be limited return windows so if the kids (for any reason) dislike the present, and want/need to return it, they can\u2019t. \n\nAll this in addition to the fact that simply storing them and hiding them for 2+ months just isn\u2019t practical. They\u2019re liable to go missing and/or get damaged, and MIL has shown frustration when this has happened. The solution is just for her to send them maybe a month later.", "I get it, ok. It's annoying to have to store stuff. Especially if you're someone like me that drowned in stuff as a child because the generation above me were  borderline horders that loved stuff. But as annoying as this is, it comes from an anxiety issue. I hope that her kids are actually helping her anxiety instead of just being enablers. You're not really an AH, but you are letting your annoyance with not wanting to be an enabler and storing stuff for a rediculous reason (mail os not that slow) cloud your reaction.", "NAH. Stand firm politely and hopefully MIL will be won round to only pressing stuff a fortnight ahead of time.", "YTA, and a giant one. If the issue was really space, your SIL offering to hold onto the gifts would've fixed that, so it seems like this is either some sort of weird power trip or you just hate your MIL.", "Yta. You sound dreadful and like a terrible daughter in law to deal with. I hope you never have to deal with anxiety.   How about you be thankful that she gives the gifts at all. She don't have to get anyone anything.", "YTA I\u2019m prepared to be downvoted for this opinion. And I normally wouldn\u2019t have it, but my mom also has anxiety. She was seriously almost in tears when I told her I couldn\u2019t take her to the post office until Tuesday to mail my brother\u2019s and his wife and son\u2019s Christmas presents. It seriously works on her mind and bothers her tremendously. It\u2019s not like she wants to have anxiety. It\u2019s not entirely rational and she\u2019s doing her best to work on it. \n\nAnd to be fair, it\u2019s not without precedent. A few years ago when trump was restructuring the USPS a priority mail (3 day) Christmas package to my bff took literally over 1 MONTH to be delivered (she just lives 5 hours away, too!) and it took 3 WEEKS longer than usual for my brother to get his package (good thing she sent it so early!) \n\nWhen you see a 72 year old grandma in tears because she\u2019s worried her grandson\u2019s Christmas presents won\u2019t get there in time, you learn to make it work, even if it\u2019s inconvenient to you \n\nEta: I mean, I absolutely get your point, and I have tried to get her not to mail packages so early because I get that it\u2019s inconvenient, but it is what it is.", "NTA.

I call her a \u201cfuture tripper\u201d because she\u2019s always worrying about something that will happen in the future and is very vocal to her 4 kids about it, which includes my husband. \n\nOne thing she started doing last year because of her anxiety about the mail being slow is sending gifts 2 months before our birthdays or Christmas. There are 4 of us in our family (me 41f, husband 41m, 2 sons under 10) and we all have birthdays in different months so at any given time, there are gifts waiting in our garage for one of us from her. She buys the gifts on Amazon, so these things usually come 2 days from when she buys them. And it\u2019s been like clockwork 2 months before our birthdays. \n\nThis has been wildly inconvenient for a few reasons. Last year we moved, this year we moved our business and had a lot of stuff we kept in the transition in our garage. This has caused gifts to go missing or us not remembering where we stored the gifts. When we tell her this, she gets anxious and upset and fixates. I\u2019m so over it. \n\nToday she was talking about what my son wanted for his February birthday (because of course we\u2019ve already been sitting on her Christmas gifts since October). I put my foot down and said \u201cLet\u2019s talk about that in the new year. I\u2019d prefer you not to get his birthday gift for us to store for a couple of months.\u201d She got offended and complained that shipping always takes longer than you expect especially if the government is going to shut down (??). I told her even still, I don\u2019t want to be in a position where I\u2019m storing my son\u2019s Christmas gift AND birthday gift for two months from now in my garage. She said she didn\u2019t know what the problem was. I told her it was honestly inconvenient and not necessary when she could even just send something two weeks in advance. She changed the subject then asked my husband to call her when he got home. \n\nHe just told me about his mom feeling offended by what I said and that she was just worried our gifts won\u2019t get to us on time. I told him I was going to cater to this anxiety of hers because it has causes too many issues. I told him it\u2019s ok to push back on some of her anxieties when they are encroaching on others. He doesn\u2019t agree and says she\u2019s old and is just like this. \n\nHe\u2019s a nice guy, so he didn\u2019t call me an asshole, I can tell he thinks it. His sister has been texting me asking if she wanted me to just hold the gifts at her house. I think this is too ridiculous of a response. But AITH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Would you like to open them so you can call her and thank her?\nMIL-  why did you give the kids their gifts so early? Mom- I was afraid I would forget where I put them. This way they don\u2019t get lost.\nOr- sorry. I forgot where I put them so they did didnt get them.\nOr, husband I need you to put these somewhere safe so they don\u2019t get lost. You can remember where you put them, right?\nOr- hey, you know Amazon sends out packages via UPS or FedEx?  The government doesn\u2019t control this, they don\u2019t get delayed.\n\nUpside,  your MIL remembers to send gifts while many of us have MIL\u2019s that never seem to get anything to their kids on time.", "NTA\n\nWhat is the worst that will happen? The mail will fail and the gift will be a little late. Better that than gifts being lost or it being inconvenient to store. MIL needs to manage her hang ups.", "This is a non-issue. Just open the gifts as they arrive and send a Thank you note", "NTA\nIt sounds like Grandma needs an intervention because worrying the government will shut down is a very unusual anxiety.", "ESH\n\nYou're creating a bigger problem than the one at hand. Storing gift boxes for a couple of months isn't/shouldn't be this big of a deal. Sorry, but organize yourself a specific spot for the gifts so they don't get lost. Kind of simple. Not a huge deal. \n\nHusband needs to start managing the gifts though. You definitely sound a little wound up over this and it doesn't seem like you're going to win over anxiety that is older than you are. So, husband gets to receive, store and organize, and retrieve the gifts. \n\nMIL - I don't know how old she is but I'll tell you my 74 year mother will not break her habits, go to therapy, or acknowledge her own anxiety. But my god, it's frustrating to deal with. MIL needs to work on her anxiety, for herself and her family.", "NTA. That's your husband's mom, let him deal with putting the gifts away and making sure that the kids won't find them and that they'll not get lost or forgotten. I'd pass that responsibility on to him so that he can deal with his mom.", "NTA \n\nI have pretty bad anxiety, I often buy gifts a month or two in advance but store them in my own home. I make sure they arrive where they need to for the birthday by paying for recorded delivery or hand delivering", "Ask your MIL : \"What happens if the gifts are late?\"\n\nPutting things in perspective can often help people with anxiety to see how irrational their fear is. Because anxiety is fear. She fears something if they are late. But there is no reason, you won't like her less if the gifts are late. You won't feel less loved if the gifts are late.\n\nAnd I agree with you that if her anxiety is putting you in a difficult situation, you're allowed to push back and set boundaries.\n\nI'll say NAH because I don't think she's doing this with a mean spirit.", "Yup YTA! Just be grateful she even gets you all a gift. Anxiety can be crippling. Pretty rude on your part.", "NAH I don't think asking her to wait until after the Christmas chaos is over before sending February's gifts is as crazy as she thinks it is. THAT is because she has a mental health issue. And to alleviate the stress your SIL stepped in with a reasonable offer because a.) she understands your side and b.) knows her mom and this is an internal struggle she lives with.", "NAH.

Like just send the gift two weeks before like everyone else", "I think you two have more in common than you realize. I mean her stressing about late deliveries and you stressing about having to store a few packages. Look, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. This is really not a big deal. \n\nThe first thing I thought reading this is how lucky your sons are to have a grandma that cares so much about getting them a nice gift for birthdays/Christmas. I honestly think that\u2019s sweet. I can actually understand that the packages are a bit of a hassle though. I don\u2019t like clutter so I get that. But the SIL has now even kindly offered to store the packages. Honestly, they sound like nice people \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude05 I\u2019ve had some serious problems with my MIL in the past so to me this just sounds like such a non issue. \n\nUltimately I think NAH, you all just need to get a little more perspective.", "Does she live nearby? Take them to her so she can store them", "NTA\n\nSorry but when someone's mental illness starts affecting other people, they either get help or you take the bull by the horns and fix the problem it's causing.\n\nSolution:  Tell your MIL that your kids are old enough now that they both prefer money.  If MIL cannot do something that simple with her mental illness, start taking the packages back to MIL and let her store them.\n\nHer kids are to blame for this getting so out of hand.  They have been kowtowing to her all these years because that's \"just the way she is.\"  Uh no, sorry.", "Just start opening gifts when you get them.

In fact MIL can send it to her place instead of yours.  I wonder how long this will last when your SIL starts to run out of space for your gifts and her gifts etc.\n\nMIL probably needs some help with her anxiety but likely won't get it because she doesn't see it as a problem and her family have enabled her for years (and accepted it... which is fine for them but not you).", "Honestly my brother often sends my daughter her presents up to 6 months late, and I'm sometimes just as bad. Our daughter is excited to get presents at any time. If my parents are away our daughter will get gifts early, or when they return.

It'll only fuel her anxiety.", "Do you not buy your kids gifts early? I mean, do you wait until the day before their birthdays or Christmas to do all the shopping? I assume you put those gifts somewhere until you're ready to gift them right? Store them all in the same place. Heck, Christmas even comes with a tree to keep them under", "It actually takes away the fun and excitement of getting anything if you have to hold onto it for two months, in particular if it comes from Amazon. I may buy some gifts during the year when I find something nice, but the recipient gets it on time and not to store. Put down your foot but likely things won\u2019t change. But you deserve some respect as well. NTA.", "YTA. It can't be that hard to designate a place in the garage, label the gifts, and keep them there.", "YTA. You should feel lucky that your in-laws want to send gifts at all. My in-laws don't send anything for birthdays or holidays, ever. My kids have two aunts, two uncles, and five grandparents and the only people who even send gifts are my own parents. Take your SIL up on the offer if it's so awful for you. You sound ungrateful, tbh.", "Plus this way you're within the time limit for sending it back if there's parts missing.\n\nMaybe that can be an argument for grandma though. A friend Ince received a box of rocks instead of the phone she ordered, we had a large purchase arrive with parts missing, there's no way to fix that after two months in the garage.", "This. You can\u2019t control when someone sends you or your family mail/gifts (but I totally see and agree with being like \u201cwe\u2019re dealing with Christmas and can\u2019t know what he\u2019ll want and not have yet for his birthday until later\u201d), but you CAN control whether you store her packages or not. When they come, give the gifts. \u201cGrandma\u2019s birthday gift for you came!\u201d Write down what it is for their thank yous two months later, or just send their thank yous immediately. (The mail could take awhile, after all!!)\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t like it, oh well. Point out the gifts aren\u2019t getting lost or misplaced or forgotten, which has happened when they\u2019re there months early. The kids will love random early gifts, too.", "Because this will cause a different kind of MIL drama \"Now he wont have a birthday gift, im going to have to get another one\" and then there is both endless complaining AND another gift.", "I agree NAH, but my suggestion would be to remind her that returns can usually only be made within a month. Ask her to order them for delivery two weeks before - that gives two weeks for it to arrive, and two weeks for you guys to return it after the event if there\u2019s a problem with the gift. Hopefully that\u2019ll give her some incentive to change.", "I think this is the best idea. You can even take pics of the kids with the gifts and wait to send them when the holiday arrives", "Agree with NAH. Also, since kids change their minds so much day to day, never mind over months, it's possible they won't even be interested in what she sent. I feel like that would have been the better/easier out than talking about her frustrations.", " If husband refuses to manage his mother and instead is willing to disrespect his wife, he takes care of the gifts from the moment they arrive.", "Definitely a husband problem.

Thank you.\"\n\nNo. \"Hubby, you mother presents for the 'X' arrived today, I have stored them in your office until 'X' birthday\" if he won't reign in his mother, then he can trip over the presents she sends. \n\nMy aunt always sent my birthday presents early with my Xmas presents because she was always out of the country over Xmas and my birthday (her annual holiday and time off from work) and my grandmother always sent my cards together (and now sends all my kids cards with mine too because they have birthdays around Xmas too) so she can save on postage but they are also only cards and I know to expect them and she knows that if the kids are short on money and want to buy something for themselves that I will give them their cards early so they can. No family members send actual presents early and will actually delay and send a present after the event instead, so it can just be handed over straight away.", "Yes this 100%. His family, his problem to deal with.", "\"The proper time\" I didn't realize that was a thing. Seriously, does OP not Christmas and birthday shop early? Put all the gifts in the same place every time. Why is it MILs problem that OP can't figure out how not to lose things?", "Idk I totally get not wanting a bunch of packages perpetually around your house. My husband and I bought our Christmas gifts early this year and packages have been arriving. It is stressing me out to have these boxes scattered around the house and there\u2019s an end date. It would actually drive me a little crazy to have this happening all the time. Maybe there are my own issues here but OP is allowed to make a reasonable request about her own home.", "I was thinking along the same lines. Yes, it's an inconvenience but it's a luxury inconvenience. You get presents early... So, what? I don't think it's something to start a fight over.", "It's a really simple request to accommodate on her mother-in-law's part. It's not unreasonable at all for her to make that request.", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t complain about this unless she\u2019s sending something giant.  I\u2019d personally just ask that it was small so we had room to store it.\n\nThe other thing I thought was that the MIL might be trying to get things on sale.", "Sending gifts early from another country and the postage system are not even comparable to sending Amazon packages to someone 2 month early, I get she is overreacting a bit but she's definitely NTA.", "There's a huge difference between overseas shipping and amazon though. Half of my family is in the US, I'm in Belgium and sure, I got my Christmas gift yesterday but it was shipped Nov 13th from NC. And I've known longer shipping times before. \n\nOP clearly says Amazon takes 2 days, and MIL only ships through Amazon. Though I would personally order a bit in advance for Christmas, you can definitely do it the week of for random birthdays. \n\nAlso MIL's coping mechanism is to make others deal with what is causing her anxiety. It's not really unjust for OP to feel like now she has to deal with a burden her MIL puts on her on top of dealing with her duties for birthdays and other celebrations. \n\nFrom everything else she says, OP seems to be in over her head, and her husband doesn't seem to help her either.", "She's not sending stuff through customs.", "Your situation seems very different from OP's since you are talking about international mail.", "I don't understand all the Y T A. This mother in law has trained her children to manage her anxiety for her so she doesn't need to work on her own issues.

That's not how you treat an adult. \n\nOP is thrown under the bus and they're working hard to get her to play the game so mommy doesn't experience any discomfort. Is this really what they should be teaching the children? What kind of crazy world are they living in?", "Yeah sorry this would absolutely shit me. Not everyone has storage and I 100% wouldn\u2019t want to be storing someone else\u2019s gifts for 2 months.

Put a bright label on a box or two and then insert and take out presents when needed and forget the whole thing the rest of the time.\n\nIf the MIL was inflicting her anxiety in ways that caused actual issues I could understand, but unless I'm missing something this sounds like OP has been inconvenienced by this when moving in the past a couple of times and has a bee in her bonnet about the issue still even when it is no longer causing any practical problems. The issue seems to be that she doesn't like her MIL being needlessly careful when it isn't really any skin off her nose.\n\nI believe in standing up for yourself when you are actually being put upon, but I am failing to see the real problem here (rightly or wrongly).", "Ordering gifts early isn\u2019t the catastrophe that OP is making it out to be. Gifts sometimes DO arrive late if you wait until December, even using Amazon. Last year there were 3 presents that didn\u2019t make it in time for my sons because USPS was bogged down. Also, Black Friday deals are pretty friggin sweet, it seems stupid to wait until the Holiday is almost upon you to order. OP should just get a box, label it gifts and store it.", "When did you meet the OP MIL?", "My point was that if this is the only issue and there isn't a practical problem (as in no space for the gifts) then it might be better to let it go because it is unlikely that MIL is going to fix her problem and so they would be constantly butting heads over what amounts to a non-issue. \n\nIf there *are* practical issues (no space or constant moving making keeping track difficult) then that's different.\n\nIf there is plenty of space and the presents are out of sight they should be out of mind too -- as I said, if it's just the *idea* of the presents arriving earlier that is bothering OP then the problem can be solved by letting go of the idea. What is the *actual* problem?", "> I told him it\u2019s ok to push back on some of her anxieties when they are encroaching on others. \n\nI actually agree with OP on this; what I fail to see is how storing some presents in the garage is causing her real problems. It sounds like she is focusing on that as it is a concrete manifestation of MIL's anxiety, which may well encroach on them in real ways, and not because a few presents in the garage are a huge inconvenience.", "If a few extra boxes makes your life insane maybe you need to work on managing your life better.", "Nope I'm a front loot too I'm afraid", "This.", "I have anxiety and knowing that it's imposing on others, no matter how well intentioned it might be, would give me further anxiety.\n\nHaving a clearly stated boundary with workable time frames would mean I know it will arrive in time and with an opportunity for the recipient to return/exchange/etc if needed...would actually help a whole fucking lot. \n\nIt is on me to make sure I'm not causing an inconvenience to someone else with my issue. If I need a gift there by a certain tim because of how it makes me feel, that's making the gift about me and my comfort. Which is kind of the opposite of gift giving. OP has clearly stated their expectations and instead of listening to a reasonable request, MIL makes it about her. \n\nNo, a suggestion won't fix everything.

If it bothers OP, then let husband own this task and together deal with how MIL\u2019s anxiety is impacting the marriage/family. Anxiety can make people feel like something is an emergency and they expect others to feel that same sense of urgency, too. But there are ways to deal with that.", "If OP is like you, then I can see the issue.

I have three kids and both my husband and I work full time. No, I\u2019m not keeping track of packages sitting around my too small house for months.

I agree with you. Storing them is annoying and the MIL should just not order them so early. \n\nI imagine this woman consumes a lot of conservative media and is constantly told to be afraid and it's leaking into her gift buying habits.
