We went together and it was my parenting time so the kids were home with me that week. They had lemonade there for people to drink and water and fruit juice.

Joe needs to back off and mind his own business. They are not his kids to raise. He can support your ex, not decide for her or for you. He has no place in that discussion. If didn't like her parenting style he shouldn't have married her in the first place", "Consult a lawyer. You might not want to change custody right now but you need to document everything. I think your wife will be consulting a lawyer too claiming you\u2019re the bad parent .", "NTA\n\nContradicting you in front of the children at every turn is really not acceptable behaviour and your ex should be recognising this. ESPECIALLY in your own home, let alone when the kids are on \"your\" time. Sounds like Joe needs to stay in his lane, and if Sammie can't see that, then the situation has changed from the original agreement and may need to go back to mediation to resolve - including Joe this time?", "NTA, you are putting your kids first though, just based on the way Joe is acting, and how they don't like the kids listening to you over them, I wouldn't be surprised if they were being punished for not listening while at mom's. Nevermind it has to be confusing for the kids who they should or shouldn't listen to and when. And there is no circumstance where Joe or Sammie should be undermining you in front of the children, this is obviously something that goes both ways. \n\nBut if it is any consolation it seems like the kids trust you more than Sammie and Joe, evident by them listening to you over them.", "NTA. If Joe is going to disagree with you in front of the kids, he's the one making joint parenting functions unworkable. He should attend the parenting classes too so everyone is on the same page. But since that's not practical, your solution is reasonable. It's fairly normal too.", "NTA. I remember vividly my stepdad knew very well that he could do no more to me than send me to my room and wait for Mom to actually punish me.   He knew very well if he tried anything with me I would quickly remind him that I had a mother and father.  He was neither. He got away with grounding my brother and my sister from their game consoles since they had come from him but even then he knew he was pushing it. I might have been a child but I probably could have just reminded him that my siblings were not his to punish.   Your situation does sound a lot different but the stepdad still kinda sounds like a controlling asshole and personally, my advice, it only gets worse.  I don't want to assume anything but my stepdad was verbally and mentally abusive to me and it would have been way worse if I wasn't my dads girl through and through.   I would keep an extra eye on him and demand your authority be respected.  Try having a family meeting if adults where you remind both your ex and her husband that you are the father, he is not.  What you say is law, what he says is negotiable.  Express with you ex how you feel he undermined you and frankly, ignore him if he chooses to say he doesn't, keep direct eye contact with you ex and tell him to piss off as these kids are yours.  Your ex might be hurt by this but hey, maybe she shouldn't have let it get this far.  NTA. Continue to be a great dad.", "Bro fuck your ex wife and joe", "NTA!

Overly strict parents drive their kids away in the long run even though sometimes they really do want the best for them. Things like lemonade at parties should not be forbidden. And undermining you in front of the kids is really a shitty move. Well done to you for standing your ground.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s gonna put the kids more out of joint having these joint activities and then watching their dad, who is supposed to be an authority figure, be under minded. Especially since joe and your ex have literally no say how you look after the kids during your parenting time unless it puts the kids in direct danger. And having a little bit of lemonade and going on a bounce house are not things that will put the kids in danger. Joe is an AH for undermining you in front of the kids. \n\nCo parenting is tough. Especially when one parent doesn\u2019t do things the way you do. It\u2019s gonna be hard for you to stay civil to them in front of the kids if they\u2019re treating you like you don\u2019t know how to take care of your kids, even though you\u2019ve been doing it for 8 years now as a single parent. Your kids have even said they\u2019re made to feel uncomfortable if they listen to you and not Joe. Not having joint parties deffo seems the best way to go for the kids sake.", "NTA.

But during my parents divorce, the standard rules with children and parent time had hard rules against step parents. Infact, even future step parents when dating. My parents were not allowed to have any partners in the house longer than visiting hours and if they stayed the night and each other found out, they could drag us back to court saying one broke the rules. He tried many times with this rule. He had zero proof and constantly did this to make our life hell. My mother never dated or remarried and the only men I knew were from the church group. The same chruch group that kicked him out for his cheating on my mom while pregnant with my twin siblings. If you have to go back to court because they are saying you are a bad parent, tell them you want to adjust custody. Request clauses that state he is not allowed to command them. Cause honestly, this isn't being just a pos and testing your patience, he's treating them like army recruites when they are your flipping kids. If they don't like this, request a session for the 3 of you since he now seems to think he is the third parent. Then ask him if he'd start paying child support or if he'd start paying towards any college funds (if you are lucky and have this ability, just using it to rub salt in this douches face), funds for potential dental work cause teens for sure end up needing it. Ask him to set aside 60% of his income solely for the kids. If he won't, then he can hit the road. Make it on paper that this dirt bag doesn't have any power. Another thing to point out is their short relationship before marriage. In my state, there's rules on when a new spouse is allowed to live with kids during shared time if you have equal custody. A lot of divorces with custody agreements will tie living establishment as base and nothing is allowed to change to keep the child in a stable environment. Meaning no bringing new people home and you need to be married for 2 years before new spouse moves in. Mommy remarrying and dragging a stranger in to the house before allowed 2 years of meet and greats and a verbal yes from you and the kids that they are comfortable with this new man. I'd honestly start looking into these cause it seems like this man came in hoping to kick you out, pick up the broken children and be the knight and shiny armor. Now i could just have horrible parents and be baisised to step parents who pull this stunt cause i had multiple step mothers (which both of my parents are narcissists so you can see why multiple) and probably made some fucked up rules to screw each other over. But still, protect your children and honestly start clapping back from his overstepping. Remind him he is not their parent and never will be and if he wants some hope of relationship with them later then he needs to stand down (cause i can tell the teen years they will swamp to you and he will rage and drive a further wedge between the kids and mom). I feel for you and hope all the best outcome.", "NTA this might be a good time to talk about the custodial agreements in place.

However his rights are limited to inside his own home, not over the actual other parent. Unless that parent is doing harm to the child. Sammie is doing herself and the children no favors trying to manipulate them using Joe against their father. He isn't an absent father he is very much active. For me that's the difference.\n\nSammie and Joe have a hard line parent style, kind of like a tiger mom, want's what's best for the children and she is the only one able to determine that, from the comments the OP has left, he has more of an active parenting style gives the kids choices in what they what. I don't think either is better or worse, just inherently different.\n\nI had a marvelous stepdad,  and my children love their stepdad and he loves them.", "What do the kids want? Forcing them into activities they don\u2019t want seems\u2026like your ex and her husband are trying to live up to and portray some ideal image of a PerfectBlendedFamily(tm) while disregarding the kids as actual individual humans with their own needs, wants, desires, and preferences. \n\nExtracurriculars are awesome when the kids want to do them and the parents support their choices. When forced, resentment abounds. It\u2019s not pretty.", "That's insane. We limited our kids to 2 extra-curriculars at any given time, and they were still involved in so much stuff just with the seasonal nature of sports.\n\nWe let them try anything and everything they wanted to try, but they had to give something else up to do it. The only restriction we had was that if they had already committed to a team sport, they had to honor that commitment to the team and stay through the end of the season before dropping it for the new thing. They could always come back to it if they wanted, but they'd never have to play it again if they didn't want to.\n\nI was so surprised with what ended up being each kids' passion. They never would have found those passions if we had forced them into travel leagues and all that other bullshit and never let them quit to try new things.\n\nWe had plenty of extra-curriculars, but were still able to have family time and downtime at night. And I still ended up having one pro-athlete to show for it.", "Okay, your ex is a little insane if she was against children choosing between apple slices and grapes.  In all my early ed classes they always stress the importance of giving children choices where you can.  The idea is that you keep giving children more and more control over their choices as they mature so that they have good decisions making skills by the time they go off to college.  I think an independent therapist needs to get involved here and advocate for the kids in court.", "Gotcha. \n\nThen NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s weirdly strict and found the same in her current husband. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t make you incorrect and it sounds like she\u2019s always been unfair to you as a coparent.", "Be very careful with her.  The two of them together are a recipe for abuse", "Ngl your ex is showing signs of emotional abuse towards your kids, maybe try and talk about how your kids feel at their moms place with them just to check base with your kiddos there", "I just wonder if Blacksmithforge3241is realy Joe.?", "OP has a real struggle bc his Ex is the real issue since ultimately she agrees with everything that's going on.  Keep reading down through his comments. . .\n\nHe's tried mediation, it didn't go anywhere. She's of the same mindset as the strict step father.", "My parents raised me like this and I grew up to love healthy food and almost never drink soda. I think making it a treat is key, as banning things completely can backfire.", "Yes....this man has no dick.", "Well that's what I heard.", "I did read the comments. Step dad speaking up is not ok in these instances . Op was not offering an allergen laced food, drugs or alcohol. Op was not offering an unsafe activity ( actually not sure about the bounce house story as there were some words missing/ grammar issues ).  No reported diabetes. Not having lemonade can be a discussion between biological parents. Mom also doesn\u2019t have the right to undermine bio dad in such a small issue during his parenting time . How do you think the kids feel about this? So step dad and mom get to make all the rules ? If we put up with that shit in my family my step son would have played no sports and would not have gone to public high school.  I absolutely do not follow the crap that the man should be the ultimate authority figure and that\u2019s what is happening with step dad.  My dad is in his 70\u2019s and loved and respected by EVERYONE . He never acted like this.  I\u2019m done responding but maybe you need to think about why you need to keep arguing about this . I want younger step parents to read my responses and examine their behavior like I had to.  When you learn better you do better.  Kids deserve thoughtful parents that can put them first over ego.", "Oh great! Thanks a lot!\n\n\nNow I absolutely HAVE to watch ghostbusters again. Anyone know where I can stream the directors cut?", "You're missing my point.\n\nTheir mother is the real problem. She is a strict, controlling parent, just like her new husband.  They are both of the same mindset when it comes to parenting.\n\nThat's why she allows him to undermine OP in front of him and their children.\n\nThat's why mediation doesn't work.\n\nHer beliefs on parenting are as extreme as his.  That's why in large part OP divorced her- they don't agree on parenting.\n\nNot only is Joe in the wrong and the AH but so is their own mother. That's been my point that you keep missing."]}
