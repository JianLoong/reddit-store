We divorced when our youngest was still a baby. Our kids are now 11, 10 and 8. Sammie has been married to Joe for the last two years.\n\nSammie and I disagreed a lot on parenting which is ultimately what drove us apart. We did mediation and co-parenting classes during our divorce (recommended by the judge). The recommendation was that we communicate about schedules and parenting conflicts on the Our Family Wizard App. But to try and work on coming together for our kids. So we did just that. Discussed parenting via the app and tried to show we could be civil in front of our kids. We even did some joint parties together for birthdays and such.\n\nEver since Sammie married Joe things have changed. He's a lot more strict than Sammie and he has undermined me in front of the kids a number of times, and both Sammie and Joe have become annoyed when the kids listened to me over Joe.\n\nExamples: Our 11 year old had a family day to raise money for his (rec) football team. We went together and it was my parenting time so the kids were home with me that week. They had lemonade there for people to drink and water and fruit juice. My oldest wanted lemonade and asked me if he could get some. I said of course and said after me that he could not, that he was only allowed water and knew that. I encouraged him to go ahead and told them that the kids are allowed more than water with me. That same day my youngest wanted to join his older siblings on the bounce house. I said sure and I would go watch to make sure he was okay. Joe said it was not a good idea and he should stay with them. Another time at my daughter's birthday party at my house and my parenting time she wanted to know if I would come and let her and the other kids bounce me around on the bounce house. Joe butted in and said he didn't want her having an adult on with kids.\n\nThis kind of thing happens frequently. I have mentioned it to them that I do not appreciate it and I do not interfere on their parenting time. But I have been dismissed repeatedly and Joe has told me that I am not a good parent and they don't approve.\n\nSo I decided no more joint stuff like this. We can attend the same functions but we should not all sit together and stop with the throwing joint parties with both sides. I spoke to my kids and they said it might be better since their mom and Joe don't like when they listen to me over Joe. I informed my ex and Joe and they said I was an ass and was not putting the kids first. I responded that it was them not putting the kids first by disrespecting me in front of the kids.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693822778, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169oaky/aita_for_refusing_to_do_anymore_joint_parties/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Joe needs to back off and mind his own business. They are not his kids to raise. He can support your ex, not decide for her or for you. He has no place in that discussion. If didn't like her parenting style he shouldn't have married her in the first place", "Consult a lawyer. You might not want to change custody right now but you need to document everything. I think your wife will be consulting a lawyer too claiming you\u2019re the bad parent .", "NTA\n\nContradicting you in front of the children at every turn is really not acceptable behaviour and your ex should be recognising this. ESPECIALLY in your own home, let alone when the kids are on \"your\" time. Sounds like Joe needs to stay in his lane, and if Sammie can't see that, then the situation has changed from the original agreement and may need to go back to mediation to resolve - including Joe this time?", "NTA, you are putting your kids first though, just based on the way Joe is acting, and how they don't like the kids listening to you over them, I wouldn't be surprised if they were being punished for not listening while at mom's. Nevermind it has to be confusing for the kids who they should or shouldn't listen to and when. And there is no circumstance where Joe or Sammie should be undermining you in front of the children, this is obviously something that goes both ways. \n\nBut if it is any consolation it seems like the kids trust you more than Sammie and Joe, evident by them listening to you over them.", "NTA. If Joe is going to disagree with you in front of the kids, he's the one making joint parenting functions unworkable. He should attend the parenting classes too so everyone is on the same page. But since that's not practical, your solution is reasonable. It's fairly normal too.", "NTA. I remember vividly my stepdad knew very well that he could do no more to me than send me to my room and wait for Mom to actually punish me.   He knew very well if he tried anything with me I would quickly remind him that I had a mother and father.  He was neither. He got away with grounding my brother and my sister from their game consoles since they had come from him but even then he knew he was pushing it. I might have been a child but I probably could have just reminded him that my siblings were not his to punish.   Your situation does sound a lot different but the stepdad still kinda sounds like a controlling asshole and personally, my advice, it only gets worse.  I don't want to assume anything but my stepdad was verbally and mentally abusive to me and it would have been way worse if I wasn't my dads girl through and through.   I would keep an extra eye on him and demand your authority be respected.  Try having a family meeting if adults where you remind both your ex and her husband that you are the father, he is not.  What you say is law, what he says is negotiable.  Express with you ex how you feel he undermined you and frankly, ignore him if he chooses to say he doesn't, keep direct eye contact with you ex and tell him to piss off as these kids are yours.  Your ex might be hurt by this but hey, maybe she shouldn't have let it get this far.  NTA. Continue to be a great dad.", "Bro fuck your ex wife and joe", "NTA! You did a good job", "Well this sucks for your kids. Keep them out of this as much as possible. \n\nWhy can\u2019t Joe just keep his mouth shut when you\u2019re around? \n\nNTA", "NTA - you sound like your doing the best for your kids and Joe isn't there dad - Their mum should stick up for them more", "NTA under any circumstances. \n\nmy (single) mom never allowed a man to tell me what to do, even when i did something wrong. she has went to bat for me against budding relationships because to her, a man who doesn\u2019t know me and didn\u2019t raise me shouldn\u2019t be allowed to dictate how i act. she is the parent, he is a stranger to me. if i am misbehaving, it\u2019s her responsibility to discipline me. when she was married to my stepfather, (i was 10 when they married) he was not allowed to touch me or discipline me at all and he was to report to her if i do something wrong. if i had to be in a position to be a single mother, i would follow the same as she did.", "I'd say NTA. Overly strict parents drive their kids away in the long run even though sometimes they really do want the best for them. Things like lemonade at parties should not be forbidden. And undermining you in front of the kids is really a shitty move. Well done to you for standing your ground.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s gonna put the kids more out of joint having these joint activities and then watching their dad, who is supposed to be an authority figure, be under minded. Especially since joe and your ex have literally no say how you look after the kids during your parenting time unless it puts the kids in direct danger. And having a little bit of lemonade and going on a bounce house are not things that will put the kids in danger. Joe is an AH for undermining you in front of the kids. \n\nCo parenting is tough. Especially when one parent doesn\u2019t do things the way you do. It\u2019s gonna be hard for you to stay civil to them in front of the kids if they\u2019re treating you like you don\u2019t know how to take care of your kids, even though you\u2019ve been doing it for 8 years now as a single parent. Your kids have even said they\u2019re made to feel uncomfortable if they listen to you and not Joe. Not having joint parties deffo seems the best way to go for the kids sake.", "NTA. Sounds like you're handling this well. Better to separate things now, before too much resentment builds up.", "NTA - I think this sounds like a great solution. Joe seems to have a problem recognizing that he\u2019s the \u201cstep\u201d parent.", "NTA. I would go to court and have time limited with Joe.", "NTA, you tried to make it work, but it sounds like the other parents are conflicting.", "NTA, you're their dad, not Joe", "He is not their parent. Parallel parenting is a thing for just these reasons. I\u2019m infuriated for you\u2026 I would be livid if this were the person my X married. How dare he.", "is there more to this?\nlike do they have the kids full time? \nif joe is raising your kids full time with ur ex and there doing a good job then i actually see why he is a little strict.\n\nwhat i don\u2019t agree is with him trying to play dad when dad is there. you have a right to your kids and u can decide if they have lemonade or not. \nhe needs to understand he is step dad. not actual dad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He is not the parent, and has no right to undermine the actual parent.  The fact that your ex allows him to do this is concerning.  She is purposefully disrespecting you as a parent, in front of your children, by allowing this.  If it keeps up you may find your children living with you full time, by their choice at some point because I have no doubt it's worse at home.

It also helps prepare them for adulthood.  If learning to plan good, healthy meals, as well as preparing those meals is a bad thing then well, I don't know what to think or say.  I do understand the sleep over thing as well because you are entrusting your child(ren) to another adult, even for a night.  I've allows insisted on knowing parents before I allowed sleep overs.\n\nExtra curriculars can be a slippery slope.  If a child has too many they become over extended, tired, unable to focus on any one thing, and well it's just unhealthy.  If it's one or two that shouldn't be an issue.  As long as the child(ren) has proper time for school work, meals, family time, friend time, and sleep extra curriculars can be a good thing.  It's all about balance."]}
