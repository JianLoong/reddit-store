They are going to charge as much as they can for everything.\n\nYour husband sucks. Chuck him out and start over because you probably would have had a bill close to that amount anyway. \n\nThe petty side of me would hide all the pain pills/ cold medication when he gets sick to make him buy more and ask him why he needs the luxury. Can\u2019t he just tough it out?", "Oh.   Well then.   I wish upon him kidney stones.", "He owes her so much more than that. Respect, common decency, some empathy and a major apology to start with.", "without any fancy extra pain medication. Deal with them the old fashioned on a budget way.", "This! My husband has had those 3 times and he is in the most pain ever. He said he feels bad about me going through it alone with our first (deployed and son decided he needed to come early). I had an epidural but I heard how horrible kidney stones are. He sounds like an absolute donkey. Divorce and get child support"]}
