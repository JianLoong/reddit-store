Also throwaway bc my husband is a frequent redditor. My husband (35M) and I (32F) welcomed our first baby three months ago. We\u2019ve been married 7 years now and decided it was time to expand our family. Everything was going well and we were in our little newborn bubble of bliss until the hospital bills came. Both my husband and I have jobs and everything financially is split 50/50, but we\u2019ve always kept our money separate with the exception of a joint account for bills. Throughout the duration of my pregnancy, I planned to go for an unmedicated natural birth with as little intervention as possible. That was up until I hit the 24 hour mark of labor, I caved and got the epidural (which I was open to having if needed). My husband had no problem with it, even encouraged it. When the bill came he brought it to me to pay all $8,000+ (after insurance) from my personal savings, I asked why. He said \u201cYou\u2019re the one that couldn\u2019t hold out for a few more hours and jacked up the bill with all your meds and an extra nights stay and he shouldn\u2019t have to pay for all of my extra requests. If I wanted luxury, I should expect to pay for it\u201d. I was stunned, and flipped out, but I\u2019ll spare you the details. He refuses to budge, calling me a princess for expecting him to pay for all the \u201cextra add ons\u201d I requested in the hospital. this is by far the biggest issue in our 14 year long relationship so far and I\u2019m so lost on where to go from here. I gave in and paid the bill, but since then we haven\u2019t been talking much and honestly I just feel disrespected. Do I have the right to feel this way or is it just hormones? AITA for expecting him to contribute towards the cost of my childbirth? WIBTA for considering leaving him?\n\n\nETA: the issue here has absolutely nothing to do with the money. We both work at high positions within our companies and are able to live a comfortable lifestyle. We are very blessed. Our joint account IS the majority of our income. I should add my husband is a bit of a tightwad who was 100% planning on paying the bill from our joint account until an epidural \u2018unexpectedly\u2019 came into play. Money is NOT the issue here, it\u2019s the disrespect. \n\nThank you Reddit for snapping me out of it and opening my eyes.

You really need to ask yourself why you're with someone that treats you this way.", "NTA. My jaw is on the floor. This isn\u2019t about the money or even the epidural, it\u2019s about him having absolutely no respect for you carrying and birthing a child that he also wanted!!! Fuck this dude omg", "NTA. First, you didn\u2019t \u201ccave\u201d because of the epidural. You took a MEDICINE to help you survive what had already been 24 hours of brutal pain. Tell yourself the truth: you made a medically necessary decision so your body could handle the stress. \n\nWhat I wonder is does this come out of the blue for you, or is it something you\u2019ve come to expect from him? Because you seem to imply everything was fine and even \u201cbliss\u201d which seems super contradictory to this behavior. \n\nThis behavior, BTW, is completely unacceptable.\n\nPerhaps looking back over the relationship you can see where this type of behavior has happened before? If not, I would absolutely be asking what has changed and why. If husband can\u2019t answer that\u2026perhaps there\u2019s a medical issue for him that has caused a personality change? If he can answer, or won\u2019t, then maybe that is also an answer. \n\nWhat I mean is, I wouldn\u2019t walk away because of one bizarre and out of character thing without at least a conversation. If, however, everything being \u201cfine\u201d was simply husband being \u201cnice,\u201d for a bit after the baby was born, then that is a big problem, and I would RUN, because someone who calls an epidural a \u201cluxury\u201d is abusive. Just because some women don\u2019t take the epidural, doesn\u2019t make it a luxury. Some people opt for no anesthetics or pain meds for surgical procedures as well. That doesn\u2019t make those things a \u201cluxury.\u201d \n\nThere is no award for who can stand the most pain, ripping flesh, tearing of muscles, etc. In fact, pain causes great stress on the heart, mind, and body. What you did was medically indicated and absolutely not a luxury.", "Was he there during your labor?  I was with my wife for both our kids births and I cannot imagine why he thinks that is ok. NTA but he is.", "op=NTA\n\nAny person who calls your medical needs Extra add-ons is the A-H.\n\nI too would be rethinking my relationship.  OF course I think since you did the \"work\" of pregnancy and Labor--he should have paid all the related medical bills--that is the LEAST he could have done--contributing SPERM is not equivalent to pregnancy/labor.", "NTA. I'm maybe a little bit biased as a child free woman because I think anyone who brings a baby into this world should just be given whatever they want, no questions asked. \n\nI think you know now you're in the clear but I'm not sure what I'd advise you do. Make him leave until he apologises? Tell the women in his life what he said and let them sort him out? Wish him luck at a custody hearing after a judge hears that?\n\nI don't know, but I would not let this go, and I would make it clear that there will be no more babies happening in the future.", "I'm not gonna tell you to ditch your 14 year relationship cause that's not really realistic - but I want you to CRYSTAL CLEAR understand you are NOT in the wrong in ANYWAY POSSIBLE. \n\nIf your finances are typically split down the middle- that is how it should have continued. You did not choose to be in copious amounts of pain, you did not choose the labor a delivery you had. If you had to have an emergency c-section, would have made you pay that too? \n\nWhat he did is VERY disrespectful and you are NOT overreacting because of your hormones. So please, put him in his place accordingly!!!", "I have zero words for this. NTA \n\nYour husband is horrible..", "NTA. He wasn't the one growing a literal human in his own body, enduring all he pain and stress for 9 months and then he calls the normal necessities around childbirth luxury?? My partner would gladly pay all of it because he'd be thankful I went through all that for giving him HIS child, at that point not even recovery included. Run, run as fast as you can, that man is showing you money is much more important than your wellbeing. I'd understand a bit more if you were both tight on money and the bill would be higher but as you said, you are not and 4000$ is not that much, it could be way more. He is a cheapskate and one of the worst kind.", "I hope next time he gets a cavity filled that you make him pay the whole thing for having the luxury of using Novicane. 100% NTA", "NTA NTA!!!! I wish you could see the look on my face as a dad and husband reading this. I\u2019m at a total point of speechless. I\u2019ve never given birth to a child however I have been there for the birth of all my children and just from that I can gauge that the pain is something I and your husband will never experience. He does understand that child is part of him even if he didn\u2019t give birth. He got to have the fun making that child you had to do the rest. He should be happy to simply be quiet and pay the bill. \n\nI wonder if he understands that he will be required to pay child support if divorce happens, and that bill will be exponentially higher than just paying the hospital bill. Your husband needs to stop seeing your relationship as transactions and realize it\u2019s a partnership, especially when it comes to children. Just think of how much fun your husband will have when he has to tell the story of how he got made a mom for asking for pain management then daddy complained like a 12 year old that there was a big bad hospital bill and mom just wouldn\u2019t pay it all by herself", "NTA. Interesting that he thinks that pushing out a baby (out of a smaller hole where a lot of women get tearing from giving birth) and getting something to help the pain is a \u201cluxury.\u201d \n\nHopefully is he ever breaks something or goes into surgery he sees his pain meds as an extra luxury that he can skip out on.", "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOUR HUSBAND??? nta", "It is very disrespectful. I couldn't stand 24 hours of contractions and got the epidural asap.\n\nScrew your husband. There's nothing luxurious about childbirth, and you shouldn't be shamed for wanting pain management.\n\nBut also fuck the american healthcare system.\n\nNTA", "NTA. What the actual FUCK? When you both have access to money, him paying HALF of the bill is, literally, the least he can do.\n\nI understand your concern about this potentially ending your marriage and NO you aren\u2019t an AH for thinking about it, but get a opinions from close friends who you trust about him overall, not Reddit folks who have no actual perspective or context aside from this one moment. Is this a weird fluke? It\u2019s a red fucking flag, but 14 years is a long time, and you have kids. He needs an attitude adjustment and needs to deliver a profound apology to you, but the real question is does this sort of harmful, willful ignorance manifest in other ways in your relationship?", "He should see how long he would be willing to go without pain medication if he had testicular torsion.  That is the closest thing men will know to childbirth.", "NTA - this is not about the money. This is about a thoughtless, inconsiderate, egotistical, emotionally stunted human being, I am scared for you and your child. His thinking reflects an inability to understand a perspective different than his. Please go somewhere safe, away from him and get some counseling. As I suspect this is not the first time he has behaved so badly, it is just the most obvious. You need to reflect why you tolerate and excuse his past behavior and why you \u201ccaved\u201d on this one, He is not right in his thinking.", "So like\u2026you\u2019re gonna update after you leave him, right?", "I feel like your husband should go to prison for saying this.", "NTA and he better pay you back the full $8000 plus some inconvenience fees.

Sorry Op but I think this is the end of your alls marriage. He is calling you a princess for not wanting to be in pain during labor. You literally pushed a human out of your body and he thinks it was a luxurious experience. That is so f\u2019ed up it\u2019s not even funny. How dare he call you names for being in pain.

Faster.", "OP; please do not give into this shitty treatment by your husband and blame your hormones. This is the most vile shit I\u2019ve ever heard and I would 100% leave my husband for this.
