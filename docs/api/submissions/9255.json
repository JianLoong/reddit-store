We decided to take a huge risk and move in with each other 5 months ago. Things have been wonderful except one huge issue. \n\nMackenzie will literally only let us eat off of the McDonalds Hercules plates from the 90s. I thought it was a joke for the first week until I went to make dinner for the first time and pulled out two of my plates from my previous apartment and she walked over and put them back and used two of the Hercules ones. I laughed and told her that this meal was hearty so we needed bigger plates and she just said no she wants to use these ones and I just let it slide. Which is exactly what my food did because these plates suck. They are slippery, small and I honestly cannot take seeing one of these stupid characters anymore. \n\nSo I stopped using them when she wasn't around but she would always ask why I didn't use them when she got home and saw them in the dishwasher or sink. This would end with her crying and asking why it was such a big deal to just do this one little thing. So I started washing and putting my own plates away until Mackenzie packed them all up. This caused our first big fight and it ended with her saying it's a small harmless thing that matters to her. So I let it go. \n\nLast week I reached my breaking point. I had made me and Mackenzie a beautiful steak dinner with the mashed potatoes and broccoli. The food barely fit on the plate and as I was turning to take the plates from the counter to the table my steak slipped off of my plate on to the floor because once again these plates are slippery as hell and there was no room on my plate anyway. I just started crying, my dinner was ruined and I could see Phil's dumbass face looking at me from where my steak was. \n\nI told Mackenzie enough was enough. I walked to the closet and grabbed my plates from storage. Mackenzie told me to grow up it's not a big deal and this could have happened using any plates. She also started crying and eventually begging for me to just use these plates. I refused. \n\nNow she won't even eat with me because I'm using regular plates. She sees me pulling them out and just grabs her food and walks away. I'm really starting to feel bad and I miss eating with her. I told my friends about it and they think I'm being an asshole because it's such a small thing.", "created_utc": 1675663050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uz67p/aita_for_refusing_to_use_hercules_dinner_plates/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only positive in her behavior is that she hadn't thrown them away or donated them (yet). She TA for using tears to control you. She is TA for refusing to eat with you unless you use the plates that make you miserable. \n\nWhy have you given in to this foolishness? You are uncomfortable in your own home. You were driven to the extreme of crying because you were manipulated into using plates that don't work for your meals.\n\nIf this is the hill she will die on, then you aren't compatible to be living together \u2013 or eating at home together.\n\nHonestly, there are a quite lot of red flags here in her behavior.

She has the right to use any plates she wants. Her body her choice, your body your choice. It's not that hard to understand. The problem is her trying to force you to use kid plates when you're an adult who wants to use normal adult plates. This is only the beginning. Too bad you found out about this only after moving in.\n\nEdited to include NTA.\n\nSecond edit for addition: I'm autistic with OCD and PTSD, so I know all about having to do things a certain way. The thing is, is that it's a me problem, not whoever I might be with's problem. If I had to eat off of a certain plate, that wouldn't mean my partner had to.

You aren't. Damn.  Your girlfriend needs some serious help.  A favourite plate is one thing, but crying because you don't want to use them, then hiding your plates...that's disturbing.

If you're looking at this long term, you need to delve into *why* she is fixated on them. \"I just like them.\" or a similar excuse isnt going to work. Above all, dont do anything to the plates because i cant help but think there might ne some kind of trauma-related attachment to them.", "NTA", "NTA, while it is theoretically a 'small thing', having something so small cause this much of an emotional reaction is definitely not a small thing. It must feel completely ridiculous to be in an argument like this, but she's being completely irrational. It's not normal to eat off the same plate every day in general, and it's *way* outside social norms to eat off Disney plates every day.\n\nYou need to figure out what's actually going on here. Honestly, if she says 'I know it's crazy but I'm attached to these because of a childhood memory and if you can do this crazy thing for me,' I think that'd be OK. But her reaction of crying and literally grabbing the food and walking away are *not* the reactions of an emotionally stable adult by any stretch of the imagination. You need to figure this out if the relationship is going to work.\n\nAlways a possibility this is fake, but I feel like the *really* weird ones are usually real, and this definitely qualifies.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
