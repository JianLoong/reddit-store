I (m23) and my girlfriend, Jane (f22) had been together for about three years. \n\nWe had a good relationship, we worked well together. We both went to college together, and also had been living together for about a year.\n\nWe had occasionally talked about kids, and how we both eventually wanted to have them, but were not yet ready. We made sure to be safe, condoms, pills, I never finished inside, even on her periods. \n\nRegardless, we lost the lottery, and she got pregnant. We both freaked out, talked, and agreed to an abortion. You can probably see where this is going. \n\nAs it happens often, she did change her mind. We had a good long discussion. I explained to her that I do not wish to be involved. I\u2019d pay child support, perhaps keep a college fund for the future, but I am not mentally ready to be a father. I am not mature enough to raise a child, I recognize that in myself. In all honesty, I do not think she is either, but that is not my choice to make.\n\nWe hit a rough patch in our relationship then, separated to try to figure out how things would proceed. I could honestly see the writing on the wall.\n\nA month later, she involved my parents. I had not told them, because I knew what their reaction would be. They would try to force me into it, they are old school like that. Anti-abortion, and everything unless there are extreme circumstances involved. In hindsight, I think it was her parents who pushed her into involving mine in the mess.\n\nWe had a giant argument, they called me extremely selfish, a disappointment, and everything else in-between. I told them they can be involved in their grandchild\u2019s life all they want but stop trying to push me into it.\n\nThen I had an argument with Jane about overstepping her bounds, and her response was essentially that she did what she felt was correct.\n\nIt\u2019s been six months since. My relationship with my ex is over, my parents have all but disowned me unless I come to \u201cmy senses.\u201d\n\nJane\u2019s stance at this point closer to her delivery is to meet the boy after birth. She is hoping that I\u2019d change my mind as she is of the mind that a boy needs a father figure in life. I\u2019ve been staunchly refusing because I don\u2019t want to make an emotionally charged decision that I\u2019d come to regret later. \n\nTo answer the inevitable vasectomy comments I know I will get\u2026 I do want kids. Just not when I am 23, going through my studies, barely financially stable, and definitely not emotionally mature enough to be a father.\n\nAITA here if I plan to set up a child support agreement, open a college fund ASAP, and leave the city instead of raising him like my ex and parents are trying to push me to?\n\nEdit: Jane would not have cheated on me. I know her, and I trust her. She has already offered a paternity test, and if she says the child is mine, then it is mine. Stop with that, it sounds rather disgusting.", "created_utc": 1681318345, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12js9ai/wibta_if_im23_only_pay_child_support_despite_my/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Better yet, sign custodial rights to Jane, relinquishing all rights to challenge custody for the child down the road.", "Withholding judgement for now. But dude, if you were using condoms and birth control at the same time and you can honestly say you didnt have any accidents, then you need a paternity test", "NTA.  It would really suck to jump in and out of a kids life or make the kid feel like they were forced on a parent.  You are being responsible and doing what is best all around.", "NTA- you can't force someone to be a father. \nOur son called and said we w ere going to be grandparents. We told him don't let anybody force you into marriage unless you love her. Take a paternity test and if that child is your you WILL support him/her. They did marry and are still together 20+ yrs later.\nThis young man is paying child support and set up a college fund.

Better to have 1 committed, willing parent than 1 committed, willing parent and a reluctant one. Reluctance inevitably shows in how you parent, and no kid deserves to fell or be unwanted. Furthermore, there's a bit of a double standard to consider; what if it was the WOMAN than didn't want to be a mother while the man did instead? Reddit, and humans in general, have this glaring double standard where a woman can put up the child for adoption without judgement, while the man is instantly vilified.", "NTA if you don't want to be an active parent it is better to not be involved than to damage the child by rejecting them. But they will feel rejected and you need to think hard about how you will feel in 5 years. If you make this choice now it is going to impact all your future relationships and changing your mind later will be hard because the damage will be done. It would be a different story if your parents didn't intend to be involved but ask yourself how you will feel when you are 30 and see pictures of them with a child that might look like you. It sucks that you are forced into this situation that you didn't want but that doesn't change the outcome.

First of all yeah OP, get a paternity test. It's really unlikely that using three birth control methods every single one failed.\n\nSecond the child has the right to be financially supported by two people, but one person does not get to make unilateral parenting decisions. They both decided on abortion and she changed her mind and wanted to be a parent. He didn't. Ergo he made it clear he didn't want to parent and she tried to force him into it anyway. This isn't a case where they both planned for the baby and then he changed his mind. He never wanted to parent. \n\nNTA growing up with one parent that wants and loves you is better than growing up with one parent that loves you and one parent that resents you.", "Oh how I love reddit....not. \n\nLet me all remind you of a post from a few days ago: \n\nOP didn't want to be a dad yet. He wanted kids later in life. He still stayed in the child's life. Even though even after years he just couldn't bring himself to love the kid. \n\nMany years later, when he was ready to have children he had 2 or so more. Obviously the now oldest child realizes that he's more loving towards the younger children. \n\nEveryone called him an asshole because OBVIOUSLY he should have never had contact with child number one to begin with. OBVIOUSLY he should have just paid child support because EVERYONE knows the child will suffer otherwise. \n\n\nWhen I pointed out that he probably felt forced by society because everyone would have called him an asshole for deciding against rising child number one, people acted like this never ever happened on this sub lol. \n\nA few days later here we are. \n\nSo please reddit make up your mind!!! Men in this situation can't seem to win. \n\nIf the only pay child support then they are an asshole. \n\nBut if they're involved in their unwanted child's life they're also an asshole because the child will notice. \n\nDoes this mean every person who doesn't want children (yet) are automatically assholes??\n\nNTA", "NTA. As long as you really do help financially throughout the child\u2019s life and help with college I think it\u2019s okay.

I would never ever judge him if he would havd just paid support. \n\nOn the other side of things I also had an abortion with my now husband. At no point did we want children...an accident happened and it was an easy option. If I had chosen to keep it I wouldn't hsve made him stick around if he didn't want to as we were 22 and 24 because we had always said it wasn't our intention. \n\nNeither of my parents were ready to be parents and I had a really rough childhood. I think it is better to step away then csuse addition harm because you're not fit to be a parent.", "NTA. You didn't choose the be a parent. You have made it very clear in the beginning and made no expectation that you will be a parent.\n\nPaying child support is your responsibility. And by doing that, you're not a deadbeat.", "absolutely NTA. you are not obligated to take care of a child you arent ready for, especially after you explicitly stated you wouldnt and agreed to an abortion. your ex went behind your back and broke that agreement, which is not your problem. if your ex can't take care of the kid on her own, she should have gone through with the abortion, or she can put them up for adoption.", "I'd say NAH. You don't want to be a parent, but are going to be responsible about child support. She naturally wants you more involved, esp as you did have a relationship before she became pregnant.\n\nBut I don't see that you have any obligation to be more involved in your child's life if you don't want to be.\n\nStill, if you stand by it, you'll have to deal with the fallout from those around you. I'd think it would be awkward if your parents see the child and you don't; maybe it will lead to a rupture in yr relationship with them. So be prepared for that.", "This may be controversial, but I think, with you and your ex, NAH. It is her body and she chose to go through with it. If you truly never, and I mean *never*, finished inside and ALWAYS used protection, it seems like a miracle that she became pregnant. Though you may be exaggerating, of course. I don't want to jump to conclusions though.\n\nIn any case, you are stepping up by providing monetary support and setting up a college fund. You had both agreed on abortion, she changed her mind, and you don't feel financially or emotionally ready for children. That is perfectly fine, but now there is one. If you go to court, and you should, things will be settled there.\n\nYou may change your mind later as you age, however. Keep that in mind as you move forward. She may find a partner that is willing to be in the child's life and step up as a parent to them. She chose this, and you chose to not physically be in your child's life. Whatever happens, I wish you both luck.", "NAH. A parent who is not emotionally ready to be a parent can be extremely detrimental to a child. You are, at least, going to step up financially. However, you might want to reconsider, and be in your son's life, at least a bit. That doesn't mean you have to take an active fatherly role but maybe just take a couple hours every couple weeks to keep up an amiable, if not close, relationship. The fact of the matter is, you DO plan on having other children someday, and this boy will be their brother. No matter how you, or I, see your actions, most people will only see you as an a** and a deadbeat, even with the financial support. As we see all the time with adoption reunions, many birth parents want a relationship later in life and, if you completely ignore his existence voluntarily, he, and your future children, will most likely see you that way too. That's probably something you'll regret later in life.", " I'm pro choice. Many people think that only means that a woman has the choice to do with her body as she chooses. If she wants a kid then she has it and if not, we'll then she has an abortion. But if we dig into it further, where is the man's choice when it comes to the kid?  He stated he wasn't ready, one day, it's not the right time, this isn't part of the plan, etc.  If we replace it with \"she stated\" everyone will say N T A.  But since he's a man, he's a dead beat. Well he's willing to pay child support and start a college fund. So I will say NTA.", "NTA. \n\nI wish my father paid child support and set up a college fund for me but instead it all completely falling on my mother's shoulders. My hope is that you consider being a part of the child's life.", "I\u2019ll probably get hell for this, but NTA\nYou\u2019re not demanding that your parents don\u2019t have a relationship with their grandson, and you\u2019ll be offering financing support. I do feel bad for this child, being rejected is not easy", "NTA, \n\nSay that you aren't mature enough, but this is a mature decision to make. If you think you will mess it up, better to not be part of the problem.  Be aware that in a couple of years, your kid will be calling someone else dad.", "NTA you made your stance clear and she went back on something you previously agreed upon. She wants the kid and these are the consequences of \\*her\\* decision. It is right that you are financially supporting any way you can, but unfortunately the consequences of \\*your\\* decision will be that you will be an absent parent in this kid's life.\n\nIt's better to be hated as a \"deadbeat dad\" than to derail your whole life in order to screw this kid up in the long run with regrets + resentment.", "I think it\u2019s better for everyone if you\u2019re not involved from the start.\n\nJust pay child support.", "NTA\n\nYou take financial responsibility so thats fine.\nYou told your ex you would not be involved early enough so she could still abort if she wanted too.\nYour ex is also at fault if the child has no dad, because she still chooses to have it although she KNOWS you won't do more than pay. \nShe has the choice to abort and you can also say you just pay and move on.\n\nStill i advise you to keep channels open and if the child wants to talk, accept and be honest.

I do understand Jane's POV, it is a difficult situation and affects her in more than one sense much more than you. I still think that if you have discussed it and decided together NOT to have a child, she has failed you. She is also using both her and your parents to force to accept HER decision. In any case this is a major red flag and I'd say there is no future for your relationship.\n\nHaving a child is also a financial decision. If you are not able to support a child, you should not have one. If your and her parents are willing to take that burden, they are welcome to do that, right?\n\nHowever, the baby is on its way and now it is too late to change that.

My husband had been there since day one as he stepped in while I was pregnant and asked to be her father. But she always knew the truth. She asked to meet the man who helped make her. He's since moved on, gotten married, and has two kids he actually wants. I had to beg him to meet her so she would be able to put a face to her genetic background. During our meeting, my husband played with our younger son at the park while we sat at a picnic table and did a getting to know you session. She mentioned a game she likes, he said he and his daughter play that game too. It was like a light switch flipped as the realization hit her. She's not his daughter. He doesn't give a rat's ass that he created her. She's just some child. She looked at me and said, \"Can I go play with Daddy on the playground?\" I said yes, and that was that. We never saw him again, and she doesn't want to. In fact, she gets angry if you mention his existence. Even when I tell my husband, \"K paid child support this week,\" she gets mad because we reminded her of his existence. \n\nI'm sharing this story because even though she has a dad, which your child may or may not have, she still had a biological need to be accepted by the person who contributed to her existence. She knows how much he pays in child support, but that's irrelevant to her (other than she thinks he should pay more) because that's not being there. \n\nEven if you saw your son a few times a year and spent a few hours creating memories and acknowledging him as your own, that would be enough.

I (m23) and my girlfriend, Jane (f22) had been together for about three years. \n\nWe had a good relationship, we worked well together. We both went to college together, and also had been living together for about a year.\n\nWe had occasionally talked about kids, and how we both eventually wanted to have them, but were not yet ready. We made sure to be safe, condoms, pills, I never finished inside, even on her periods. \n\nRegardless, we lost the lottery, and she got pregnant. We both freaked out, talked, and agreed to an abortion. You can probably see where this is going. \n\nAs it happens often, she did change her mind. We had a good long discussion. I explained to her that I do not wish to be involved. I\u2019d pay child support, perhaps keep a college fund for the future, but I am not mentally ready to be a father. I am not mature enough to raise a child, I recognize that in myself. In all honesty, I do not think she is either, but that is not my choice to make.\n\nWe hit a rough patch in our relationship then, separated to try to figure out how things would proceed. I could honestly see the writing on the wall.\n\nA month later, she involved my parents. I had not told them, because I knew what their reaction would be. They would try to force me into it, they are old school like that. Anti-abortion, and everything unless there are extreme circumstances involved. In hindsight, I think it was her parents who pushed her into involving mine in the mess.\n\nWe had a giant argument, they called me extremely selfish, a disappointment, and everything else in-between. I told them they can be involved in their grandchild\u2019s life all they want but stop trying to push me into it.\n\nThen I had an argument with Jane about overstepping her bounds, and her response was essentially that she did what she felt was correct.\n\nIt\u2019s been six months since. My relationship with my ex is over, my parents have all but disowned me unless I come to \u201cmy senses.\u201d\n\nJane\u2019s stance at this point closer to her delivery is to meet the boy after birth. She is hoping that I\u2019d change my mind as she is of the mind that a boy needs a father figure in life. I\u2019ve been staunchly refusing because I don\u2019t want to make an emotionally charged decision that I\u2019d come to regret later. \n\nTo answer the inevitable vasectomy comments I know I will get\u2026 I do want kids. Just not when I am 23, going through my studies, barely financially stable, and definitely not emotionally mature enough to be a father.\n\nAITA here if I plan to set up a child support agreement, open a college fund ASAP, and leave the city instead of raising him like my ex and parents are trying to push me to?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Or his ex cheated.", "She's not having a child on the assumpsion that he'll come around. OP made it clear she's having the baby 'cause she's doing what feels right. OP only said she's hoping that he'll come around. That's okay thing to hope for a single mom since they had good relationship before again like the OP said.\n\nOP has right to not be involved.

Sure there's a lot of programs and organizations out there that can help with funding for cribs, food, diapers and supplies, but it also falls on the father to help support the child financially. Who cares if mom is using some of it to help pay for the electric? That's what it is there for. If you want to admit or not, money does help children get further in life when used appropriately.", "This is stupid.\n\nSociety already dictates men as \"breadwinners\", by giving majority custody to the mother and forcing men to pay huge sums of money not being monitored if its actually being used on the child or not.\n\nThe women already get to dictate whether the child will actually be born vs aborted, regardless of what the guy may want. \n\nNow you are saying that a guy should be forced to be involved, despite what he wants, even if he is already being forced to pay child support?", "Cool cool well when you're making the same arguments as those who want to remove the right to abortion, you should rethink your take.", "No. \n\nIf women have the right to step away then so should men. \n\nShe held all the cards here. \n\nYour arguments are very reminiscent of the anti-abortion brigade btw.

So why isn't this being afforded to the man?\n\nHe isn't a deadbeat. He will be paying for the child. A deadbeat is someone who does neither (pay or visit).", "She also chose to hop on his penis,  it takes two young one. And he also stated he would help with anything financial.

Because I understand the meanings of basic words and sentences?", "A deadbeat is a parent that does neither pay or visit the child. \n\nHell, I know my Father wish I had the money instead.", "This argument has been used ad nauseum and its nonsense.\n\nFirst off, the average cost of a child varies  wildly from state to state, which means it can be as much as $1000 or as low as $400. Child support ALONE is not the only cost that is forced upon the father, on top of the fact that the CS is a flat fee DESPITE however much the mother may actually need. Insurance, child care, etc. are all costs that could be forced upon them as well. So \"rarely half\" is nonsense when the average wage of men covers more than 100% the average of the cost of a child.\n\nLow scale to no child support payments are only done by the most scummy dads who don't work or living on dirt wages bouncing from multiple jobs. This is not the case for MOST child support cases. Someone making as low as $40k would be paying nearly $600 a month (not including insurances).

Viewing sex's ultimate goal as a pregnancy is fucking sad and it makes me sad for you that you think that way.", "> Its not very unlikely that people get pregnant even when using condom and pill, this happends way more often then you know, seriously.\n\nIt is very unlikely that people get pregnant even when using condoms and pills. Not so unlikely that it can't happen (see: this story), but when you're talking billions of people there will be a few that get through.\n\nDepending on the pill used and how well it's used, pills are between 90-99% effective at preventing pregnancy over the course of a year. Condoms are 98% effective, using the same metric, and the rhythm method is 75% effective. Combine those together, and what they were doing is 99.85% effective at preventing pregnancy in a given year. Considering vasectomies are only 99.8% effective, I'm with the other person in wondering what exactly he was supposed to learn. Not to play the lottery, maybe?\n\nOP's birth control practices were fine. They just got (un)lucky.\n\nHe's still an AH if he chooses to run out of town instead of being involved with his lotto ticket.", "Well he used three methods of birth control and he and his partner decided on abortion and she changed her mind and tried to blackmail him into being a parent.

Only 7% resulted in the mother's recieving full custody. \n\nSo nobody is \"giving\" the mother's custody other than the father's who can't be bothered to actually just fight for it.", "What the hell did I say about removing the right to abortion? I don't think the government should have the right to remove it. I'm against it if the only reason is because the parent's find out the child will have a disability and I would personally never get one. But I don't have an issue with abortions as a whole or in general. I don't see where I'm making arguments for the removal of abortion in the US?", "I agree with this. He was very clear before and after that he did not want a child. He gets a choice as well.\n\nIt's different when a couple decides to have a child together and then changes their mind. Then I would say deadbeat parent because a choice was made. But he was very clear and is taking on financial responsibility. The woman does not get to decide for both parties involved. She gets to make a choice (well kinda considering what's happening in America) but so does he.\n\nNTA for not wanting to be a parent but kinda asshole for denying your parents the same choice", "I am VERY prochoice. I believe it would have been in her best interest to terminate the pregnancy.

It\u2019s just biology.", "Lol", "You keep making excuses for creating a baby, which happends through sex, intercourse.

My guess is no, so at least the financial support is there. \n\nIt could potentially be much worse for the child if OP has these feelings and chooses to be a parent anyway. At least with the child support and college fund, the father is contributing in a very meaningful way.", "If you actually dive into that study, \"joint or majority\" being lumped is misleading.\n\nJoint does NOT count as 50/50, and joint is SIGNIFICANTLY the higher number vs majority for men.\n\nEx. The man can be granted thursdays and every other weekend for visitation, so alternating between a singular day and 3 days. This would still count as joint custody.\n\nThis does not disprove my point, which I said \"By giving MAJORITY custody to the mother and forcing men to pay huge sums of money\". They are giving the mothers more time than the fathers and the fathers are forced to pay child support. The court VERY RARELY agrees to a 50-50.\n\nMen avoid court because its in their best interest to avoid high legal fees UNLESS there are extenuating circumstances that a lawyer would know their chances are high.", "You're asking him to have a relationship with a child he didn't want because he didn't think he is ready. \n\nThat's the reason many women give for wanting an abortion. \n\nWe are either pro choice or we aren't.

Oh that's right, because it's their body and their lives and they shouldn't be forced into parenthood when they did everything to prevent it and made it very clear from the start they didn't want it. \n\nIt's so damn hypocritical", "You're not pro-choice because your own opinions show you're not really that bothered about people not wanting to be parents unless they're women. They both did everything to prevent this, made it very clear but then SHE decided to become a parent.
