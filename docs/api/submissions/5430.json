She was only 19 then, now 36. She was no contact with her family, and my parents kind of took her in. Dad helped around her house, and mom always cooked extra for her. She started attending college and my parents wanted to make her life a bit easier since she had no one.\n\nTo me, she was and is Aunty J. She babysat me, took me shopping, and gave me as many gifts as my parents. She was always there.\n\nMy paternal grandma also adored her, and treated like her own. So when she passed away, she made Aunt J her executor. J was pre law but she switched to business management. My dad and his siblings got a few things, but grand kids got everything else. My grandma's will was clear. She didn't want any fighting between grandkids. So, her will stated to sell everything apart form what she left to her kids, and distribute the money evenly between all 7 grandkids even if it meant we will loose some chunk of money as a result. I guess she saw something I was too stupid to see,\n\nJ did it as grandma requested, and she gave a cheque to all seven of us. We each got a little over 100k. My cousins were ecstatic. They were all older than me. They paid of their debts, or put deposits on houses etc. That was 6 years ago. I was 18 then.\n\nI didn't know what to do with my money as my parents saved up for my college. Aunt J suggested to invest most of it, and use a little bit to get something for myself. Since it's her actual job to invest other people's money, I gave it to her, after discussing it with my parents. I went to college and between my parents savings and mine, I had enough to not to dip into the 100k.\n\nEdit: J gave the same advice to all others, but after using some money to settle debts etc., they blew rest of it on cars, vacations etc.\n\nAs we couldn't do Christmas dinner this year, the whole family decided to meet early and relax for a day at my parents house. I got into Harvard Business program, and I excitedly shared the news. After the congratulations, the topic naturally diverted to money and scholarships. I said I am good and I don't really need any scholarships.\n\nThey were confused and I explained to them Aunt J helped me invest and now I have more than enough to live rest of my life comfortably. I guess I might be a bit TA here. I didn't brag about the money but I praised J to high haven. How she was a genius etc. I mean, she turned 100k to 3 Million in six years.\n\nNothing happened that day but I started getting calls next day for money. When I refused they started accusing J of being unfair, and that she gave me more money than others because she loved me. They refuse to believe J turned 100k into 3 Million. They think part of it is still from grandma's inheritance and J scammed them.\n\nThey said they'll sue, and J said, go ahead. Mom wants me to give a little bit to others to avoid the drama bit i don't want to.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT: Alright, got a DM saying bullshit. So, here's the break down. J invested 80k of 100 along with her money in BTC, It was less than 1k at the end 2016. When it started slipping J sold everything in March this year. We could've gotten more if she sold it in December 2022, but I am very happy with her.", "created_utc": 1671775918, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt84el/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritance_with_my/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not give them a cent-that\u2019s the same as giving a drink to an alcoholic. You did made a mistake- discussing money, especially with people you knew were already financially irresponsible. Why they know how much you have is beyond me. I\u2019m thankful J isn\u2019t mad at you. Apologize to her for dragging her into a mess, but you both need to hold your ground. Let them try to sue. They likely won\u2019t be able to take it very far.  You have the evidence you need to make it a short process, and they likely don\u2019t have the funds to hire a lawyer.", "NTA you were smart and invested. They have no grounds to sue; they will just have more debts. Greed can tear families apart. Tread carefully, OP. This is a tough spot you're in.", "NTA. Why the heck do you have to share your inheritance with ur cousins if they all got the same amount from them at the same time? It was their fault that they spent it all in a few weeks.", "NTA. Everyone received the same amount. That you invested your money and reaped the benefit doesn\u2019t mean you owe the others a thing.

You have no obligation to share that money with them, and did nothing wrong by investing it.\n\n  \nBUT. You say you didn't brag about the money, but you apparently told them you had 3 mil... which, let's be real, is bragging about the money. Bragging about your 3 mil was kind of a dick move. Yes, they didn't make good decisions, but it seems like you kinda rubbed their noses in it. I would have left it at \"I invested the money and have enough to pay for my college and then some thanks to J!\"", "NTA\n\n>Mom wants me to give a little bit to others to avoid the drama\n\nThis is a naive, short-sighted way of thinking and it never works out. \n\nIf a monkey learns that pressing a red button makes a banana shoot out, what is its next step after it has eaten the banana? Being satisfied and so never pressing the button again?\n\nIf your cousins get that bit of money they will want more and will be convinced their claims have merit. I doubt that they would be satisfied if you gave them all an equal share of the money you have now, especially if your investments make more again in the future while they squander their money. \n\nThere is no easy escape where you avoid drama and stress. There is just a choice between going through the hassle of telling them all to back the hell off as they've already had their share, and the stress of caving then being siphoned dry, with them coming back for more later.", "NTA\n\nyou owe your cousins nothing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In turn they just ended up bitching at her for flaunting her money + not giving them enough money. So just know that you\u2019d be the bad guy even if you have them money.

They are dummies for not listening to her", "NTA and don't give them a penny, because then they'll come back for a pound.\n\nThey had the same opportunities as you did, but hopefully you have a clean audit trail of separation because it can be considered a conflict of interest having the executor of a will invest that same money for just one beneficiary (regardless of how many people they offered it to).", "It's your money!", "Give them nothing, make sure that nobody has access to this money.
