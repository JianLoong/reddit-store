She was only 19 then, now 36. She was no contact with her family, and my parents kind of took her in. Dad helped around her house, and mom always cooked extra for her. She started attending college and my parents wanted to make her life a bit easier since she had no one.\n\nTo me, she was and is Aunty J. She babysat me, took me shopping, and gave me as many gifts as my parents. She was always there.\n\nMy paternal grandma also adored her, and treated like her own. So when she passed away, she made Aunt J her executor. J was pre law but she switched to business management. My dad and his siblings got a few things, but grand kids got everything else. My grandma's will was clear. She didn't want any fighting between grandkids. So, her will stated to sell everything apart form what she left to her kids, and distribute the money evenly between all 7 grandkids even if it meant we will loose some chunk of money as a result. I guess she saw something I was too stupid to see,\n\nJ did it as grandma requested, and she gave a cheque to all seven of us. We each got a little over 100k. My cousins were ecstatic. They were all older than me. They paid of their debts, or put deposits on houses etc. That was 6 years ago. I was 18 then.\n\nI didn't know what to do with my money as my parents saved up for my college. Aunt J suggested to invest most of it, and use a little bit to get something for myself. Since it's her actual job to invest other people's money, I gave it to her, after discussing it with my parents. I went to college and between my parents savings and mine, I had enough to not to dip into the 100k.\n\nEdit: J gave the same advice to all others, but after using some money to settle debts etc., they blew rest of it on cars, vacations etc.\n\nAs we couldn't do Christmas dinner this year, the whole family decided to meet early and relax for a day at my parents house. I got into Harvard Business program, and I excitedly shared the news. After the congratulations, the topic naturally diverted to money and scholarships. I said I am good and I don't really need any scholarships.\n\nThey were confused and I explained to them Aunt J helped me invest and now I have more than enough to live rest of my life comfortably. I guess I might be a bit TA here. I didn't brag about the money but I praised J to high haven. How she was a genius etc. I mean, she turned 100k to 3 Million in six years.\n\nNothing happened that day but I started getting calls next day for money. When I refused they started accusing J of being unfair, and that she gave me more money than others because she loved me. They refuse to believe J turned 100k into 3 Million. They think part of it is still from grandma's inheritance and J scammed them.\n\nThey said they'll sue, and J said, go ahead. Mom wants me to give a little bit to others to avoid the drama bit i don't want to.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT: Alright, got a DM saying bullshit. So, here's the break down. J invested 80k of 100 along with her money in BTC, It was less than 1k at the end 2016. When it started slipping J sold everything in March this year. We could've gotten more if she sold it in December 2022, but I am very happy with her.", "created_utc": 1671775918, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt84el/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritance_with_my/", "score": 732, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not give them a cent-that\u2019s the same as giving a drink to an alcoholic. You did made a mistake- discussing money, especially with people you knew were already financially irresponsible.

They likely won\u2019t be able to take it very far.  You have the evidence you need to make it a short process, and they likely don\u2019t have the funds to hire a lawyer.", "NTA you were smart and invested.

Why the heck do you have to share your inheritance with ur cousins if they all got the same amount from them at the same time? It was their fault that they spent it all in a few weeks.", "NTA. Everyone received the same amount. That you invested your money and reaped the benefit doesn\u2019t mean you owe the others a thing.

You have no obligation to share that money with them, and did nothing wrong by investing it.\n\n  \nBUT. You say you didn't brag about the money, but you apparently told them you had 3 mil... which, let's be real, is bragging about the money. Bragging about your 3 mil was kind of a dick move. Yes, they didn't make good decisions, but it seems like you kinda rubbed their noses in it. I would have left it at \"I invested the money and have enough to pay for my college and then some thanks to J!\"", "NTA\n\n>Mom wants me to give a little bit to others to avoid the drama\n\nThis is a naive, short-sighted way of thinking and it never works out. \n\nIf a monkey learns that pressing a red button makes a banana shoot out, what is its next step after it has eaten the banana? Being satisfied and so never pressing the button again?\n\nIf your cousins get that bit of money they will want more and will be convinced their claims have merit. I doubt that they would be satisfied if you gave them all an equal share of the money you have now, especially if your investments make more again in the future while they squander their money. \n\nThere is no easy escape where you avoid drama and stress. There is just a choice between going through the hassle of telling them all to back the hell off as they've already had their share, and the stress of caving then being siphoned dry, with them coming back for more later.", "NTA\n\nyou owe your cousins nothing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In turn they just ended up bitching at her for flaunting her money + not giving them enough money. So just know that you\u2019d be the bad guy even if you have them money.

They are dummies for not listening to her", "NTA and don't give them a penny, because then they'll come back for a pound.\n\nThey had the same opportunities as you did, but hopefully you have a clean audit trail of separation because it can be considered a conflict of interest having the executor of a will invest that same money for just one beneficiary (regardless of how many people they offered it to).", "It's your money!", "Give them nothing, make sure that nobody has access to this money.

Aunty J's investment strategy was just dumb luck. Nothing more. \n\nBitcoin could easily have collapsed over those 6 years and you would have been left with 20k.\n\nHer strategy is OK only if you are happy with the large risk of losing your investment. \n\nFor a safer investment comparison, the S and P 500 index rose by about 55-60% in the last 5 years.\n\nMy advice is get a different investment manager", "NTA and when they bring you to court to sue, dont forget to make sure they pay your lawyer/court fees as well.", "NTA\n\nIt's your money and you made wiser choices with it than your cousins.\nFrom now on, I strongly suggest never bringing the money topic with them.

They wanted to try alternatives. The sad fact is if they had asked J directly, she would have paid their medical bills without a second thought.\n\nJ isn't close to them but she isn't a stranger either.

DON'T TALK ABOUT YOUR FINANCES WITH OTHER PEOPLE. Unless it is absolutely necessary(ie to a fiancee).", "NTA. Don\u2019t give anyone a dime.

Shame on your mother tell her to help out the cousins if she feels so bad for them. It is absolutely not your fault you saved and invested instead of buying luxury in the moment item's. \n\nI'd tell them to save up some money now and have Aunt J help them invest now and hopefully in a few years they will be where you are, until then tell each cousin to kick rock's! Sorry not sorry you blew your money and didn't save it for the rainy day!", "NTA in any way shape or form! Good for you and good luck at Harvard. \n\nWhen your family inevitability starts bothering you for money again, and no offense it sounds like they will, tell them you tried to double up the money again, knew bitcoin was going to bounce back in a major way, and that you lost it all and will now have to rely on your education to provide for you. See how many reach out then. I\u2019d like to think that\u2019s how I would play it in your shoes.", "NtA, if you give them money now to appease them they will inevitably DEMAND more later.", "That investment was very risky, as many are. I bet the cousins wouldn't be lining up to help if OP had lost all the money that had been invested!", "Happy cake day!", "Ye give them your small finger and they will take your whole hand .\n\nGood advice, Mom...", "Yup. Giving them anything will not help. If OP wants to throw her Mom a bone, should could ask J to help her draw up a loan contract to offer to anyone who wants money.

Why? because the OP was the only one who was smart about it? Oh no.", "I know right, flying mokeys.", "Investing is not a gamble.

I'm glad it worked out for OP and I hope he enjoys Harvard but and I mean no offence to OP, she advised an 18 year old who just received 100k to invest 80k in an unregulated, highly volatile market. \n\nGiven that this is her day job, this was awful advice to give to a teenager. It's people like her who believed the housing market would never fail, bet big on CFDs, lost their clients their retirement funds and savings and caused the 2008 financial crisis. \n\nBy all means invest 10% to 20% in ultra risky assets but 80%! This is poor judgement.", "There is a brutal series of articles (4 or 5 long posts) on Best of Reddit about entitled family who wanted to get money from someone not even blood related, married into the family.

If they used their money to pay down mortgages, get out of debt, etc that was a wise decision on their part. Getting out of debt is a good decision.  I have the feeling there was a bit of gloating going on.  \n\n\nBy the way 3 million may sound like a lot at this point but use it to buy a house, pay health insurance, etc, it's not as much as you think it is. Granted I didn't earn that much in my entire career but still...life is expensive.", "NTA- i think people are overlooking the fact your cousins want money from you because they believe aunt J gave you more of your grandmother's money than you were entitled to. So they are accusing her of a kind of embezzlement. This is a serious accusation. Do not give them any money or even loans, don't muddy the water. They might actually sue and you'll have forensic accountants scrutinizing all transactions. Take this seriously OP. You don't communicate with someone trying to sue you, you have them speak to your lawyer.", "I call BS on the story. So J who is supposed to look out for your money picked one of the riskiest investments she could (BTC) and dumped 80% of your 100K investment in THAT? She was either a visionary or this story is made up", "NTA. You took J's advice and inveated your money. Unlike your cousins. You owe no one anything. If you give now, you'll be expected to later.

Your cousins went with instant gratification and you took the long road and invested the money.\n\nI am no lawyer (and you might want to speak with one) but I don't think your cousins can sue you but instead would have to sue J as she was the executor of the estate.\n\nIf for somehome they do manage to sue you, make sure you counter-sue for legal expenses.  Once the judge takes a look at the records and your investment statements, this should be an open and shut case.  Then you can recover anything you paid your lawyer to defend you from the frivolous lawsuit.\n\nCongrats on getting into Harvard.", "NTA...give them nothing. It's their right to sue if they think she held back but don't worry about it.  It's as if you bought a house for 100k, sold it, got 3 mil and now they want the profit ...nope", "NTA,\n\nDon't give them anything, because they will NOT STOP until you're poor. \n\nAlso, let this be a lesson for you to shut up and never brag about money.", "NTA.

Anyone asking got money will not be considered family.\n\nAnd geez, your mom.  I think your mom just wants the family \"status quo\" where everything is like it used to be - resulting in her plea to \"just give them some money\". \n\n Sit your mom and dad down and explain what so many people in this post have said.  Your cousins made their own decisions about their money.  You made a potentially risky decision to invest and was fortunate, with Aunt J's financial skills, to gain a lot of money.  And your cousins had the same choice and opportunity to do so, they chose not to. To give your cousins money now is to open the door to give them money forever.  You could give them all your money and they'd accuse you of still having more money that your hiding from them.  Your mom just wants to give them money so everything goes back to normal - she doesn't realize it's a \"monkeys paw\" resolution.\n\nDude, it's time to tell your family that all your money is put away in 401k accounts and is untouchable, except what you need for school.  And you've already made out a will and your money would go to charity.  Stick to that story, even if it's not true.  Never again tell anyone about your money situation.

Don\u2019t tell people about your wealth. Haven\u2019t you seen American Gangster?", "NTA.  Don't give them a dime.  They will try to bleed you dry.", "NTA.  If just the fact that it's your money isn't enough reason, they've shown they'll just piss away anything they get.  You never should have told them how much you had though.  It's none of their damn business.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t asking for inheritance - they are asking for your profits. Do not share. Congrats on Harvard!!!", "NTA but this doesn't add up.

It grew to $4.8M in 2021, dipped to $2.3M, rebounded to $4.9M, and she still held steady until liquidating at $3M this past March.\nIf that's true, she's not a genius.

This post is likely fake.", "Except she went 80% into BTC?", "> You never tell people that you have money especially if you know they are money hungry\n\nYes, even people in my own family, although they know I don't worry about money, don't really know how well off I am, especially the WSSs' (Wicked Step Sisters).  They expect people of means to show certain \"signs\", like driving something other than a 16 year old Toyota.\n\nI have no doubt that, if they knew, the WSSs' would be on my doorstep with hands out.", "It was clearly going to be something like that.
