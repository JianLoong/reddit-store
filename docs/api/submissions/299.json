Ever since... as long as i can remember, my mom asked to know all about who i date. i'm not a kid anymore, but i still live in her house. Now, here's the thing- i'm a lesbian, and she's homophobic (no, i am NOT out to her). As a kid, i promised to tell her about who i dated. But now, i worry that i could get kicked out. I'm not gonna be bringing her home or anything along those lines. Is it bad that i don't wanna tell her, at least until i know that i'd for sure have a secure living situation. I have several people in my life who do know about the gf, and i've known the girl since i was like... 10. I feel safe with her, and i know her family quite well. Is it bad to not tell her, for my own safety?\n\nAlso, a note: my dad probably wouldn't be happy either, but i trust him much more.

Our oldest daughter came out at 16 and we were thrilled for her. \n\nSo you said \"several\" people know about your gf, when that many people know it's not a secret anymore. If I were you I'd get a serious job and really start lining things up to move out on your own. It sounds like if your mom ever found out she'd kick you out.", "Ywnbta. how old are you? Do you work and does your gf? Worse case if your mom kicks you out get a place of your own and attempt to reconcile with your mother. If she doesn't want to support you after awhile then sadly cut off contact with her. But don't hide who or what you are.

I'm a lesbian too and you shouldn't have to assimilate to what your mom wants and believes nor is it her business who you're with. You're an adult so thus you can make you're own decisions.

So sorry that you\u2019re in that position with your mom", "If you have family who is supportive then ask them ahead of time and let them know the situation. That your mother is against gay couples and is homophobic and you want to tell her, but you're afraid that you won't have a place to go to. Also I forgot to mention how does your gf feel about this? If she isn't a hundred percent on board then I'd hold it until she is. Worse case save up until you have enough for a deposit on a place and try and find stable work in the meantime", "oh i just realized i totally misread your first post, mb. we don't wanna live together at the time, i meant a place for myself :). ok anyways, i'm actually not really out to my family at all, besides one cousin (halfway across the country lol). i'm planning on starting the coming out process soon though."]}
