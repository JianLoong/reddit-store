She is offended that he loves you more than her, even though she clearly puts his interests ahead of everybody else.\n\nShe doesn't mind that she is damaging her relationship with you to give him a brief smile.  From now on you'll remember this gift and wait for the time when she comes back to say 'that was really for your brother'", "NTA - you\u2019ll never see that tablet again if you give it to your brother.

Just understand that this will never end.   This is through no fault of your own.  You did nothing wrong.  This is your mom's problem.  The sooner you realize this, the easier it will be to realize you will never be as important to mom as your brother.  Never.\n\nSo, be your own favorite person.  Do like I did.  Buckle down in school, take practice ACT/SAT tests. Keep those grades and get those test scores up for yourself.  Get yourself as much of a chance to get a scholarship, even partial, to a nearby state college or trade school.  She won't be helping you.  All of her money and attention will go to your brother.

But to do so with an excuse of giving it to a brother who steals and uses money for pot is beyond belief. I suspect something else is going on that she is not telling you, but that is beside the point. It also sounds like your mother is failing to address your brother\u2019s inappropriate behavior, but it is not your place to correct her, but it would be great to see her and your brother get some counseling.

She bought it for you and WHAT parent (I am a parent of 3 btw) buys their kid a tablet to keep one of their kids theiving ways in check?

It is impossible to ever trust them if it happens over and over again no matter how many times they apologize for it and promise to never do it again. \n\nHow can a thief have good a heart? People are what they do, theft is really shitty. Your mother playing manipulation games to take back something a long time after the fact is shitty. \n\nIt's not a grudge to not like shit.

I was wondering about your mom failing to set limits on appropriate behavior (stealing money or things for pot, legal or not is unacceptable behavior). I thought she might be single mom. In some respects, it the situation is a bit worse  - you have a dad, but it sounds like he is also ineffective at setting appropriate standards. Having a discussion with your parents and expressing your discomfort with your brother\u2019s stealing things and drug use might be the only thing you can do, as long as you can keep your emotions level, and don\u2019t accuse them of anything, such as being bad parents or making mistakes, Just just state that you have observed \u201cinsert stuff,\u201d that it makes you uncomfortable, and ask if they can do something about it, and if not, suggest family counseling.", "Petty ass me would let my brother have it and sneak in after he's asleep and take it back.

Or let it out of your sight/control.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. But purely out of curiosity since he doesn\u2019t steal from you, what is it your mom thinks your holding a grudge over? Because he obviously did something wrong. And if it\u2019s bad enough I like being petty and since he\u2019s already stealing shit take even more expensive stuff than what\u2019s he\u2019s taking and kinda hide it so you\u2019re not actually stealing it but that it escalates to a point where he has to leave", "Sorry, but your brother is your mother's favorite. There is nothing you nor him could say or do to change it. Now, maybe you shouldn't have reacted the way you did, but I am glad you stood your ground. I'd like to say as a fellow black sheep that it gave me the courage to do the same myself, but I'm more of the type to silently resent for decades and when the time comes for her to go in a home let her favorite handle it since I was never good enough for anything anyway, but that's me. Also, even with what was said, your mother may very well just go into your room when you're not there and steal your tablet to give to him. So, just realize that is a possibility.\n\nHowever, I do think it is important that as soon as you are old enough to leave that you do. Honestly, if you have any other place you could go to and stay at until you're a legal adult, I'd suggest that because continuing to live in a house where you're just an after thought or a means to an end will just tear you down more.", "NTA. This is a bit effed up. You worked hard to get a gift from your mom, and your thieving brother should be gifted your tablet that may or may not be pawned for weed?  Just no.

When you give someone a gift you can\u2019t just take it back after six months, like what the fuck?? And she wants to give it to your brother who\u2019s been stealing from her and selling stuff for weed? Why does she want to get him a gift?

They are strong and can grow anywhere, just like you .", "Ah pettiness not required then. Except towards your mom. Just cut all communication that isn\u2019t initiated by her.

People with good hearts don\u2019t steal.", "NTA  And your mom makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  You don't reward a thief with other people's stuff.  And if he got his hands on it he would absolutely sell it for more weed.  The reason he hasn't stole it from you is you are guarding it.  Sorry you are going through this.", "NTA, so basically your mother is saying that because your brother is a thief, she wants to steal from you and give him your item, so he has something else to do with his hands?\n\nYour mother's an asshole.", "NTA, but your mom and Mr. sticky fingers are. Don't ever forget how fast she snapped on you to defend someone like your brother. Don't hold a grudge, but don't forget it either. Your mom is a dirty piece of pickme work.", "NTA\n\nIf she tries to take it, smash it, it\u2019s yours anyway.", "NTA. why would you reward a thief in hopes of fixing their theviery problem..", "I'd wager the reason he doesn't steal from OP is he knows OP won't brush it under the rug to enable him like everyone else does. He steals from mom not because he loves OP more, but because mom allows it.", "Yeah she wants the attention from her favorite, and is angry that her favorite has favored someone else", "Op is actually respected. Mom is a pushover.", "Hang in there!\n\nIn the meantime, I'd recommend backing up anything on that ipad you don't want to lose, and maybe remove anything sensitive you might have on there. It seems like your mom might try just take it, unfortunately.", "NTA!! If your brother is stealing and selling things to buy weed then he most likely has an addiction problem. Yes, such a thing as addiction is a chemical imbalance that allows us to become addicted to whatever substance. As such it needs intervention and medical help. What it absolutely does not need is enabling in any way. And it sounds to me as though your mother is more than willing to enable your brother.\n\nShe was dead wrong to do what she has done. I am sorry you have to  deal with this. The good kid should never before to know that they are second fiddle to the not good kid. Someone really should tell your mother that her parenting skills suck rocks! Once she gave you a gift there is no excuse to ask you to give it to someone else. Especially if it is a gift that you have been using non-stop from the day you got it.", "So basically he's decided to not be a parent. And what does he say about your brother's thieving habit?", "This is really good advice, OP. I'm sorry your parents suck. Hang in there and know a lot of internet strangers are rooting for you!", "Indeed. Even if you lose the item, don't lose the content", "keep that item under lock and key, perhaps? also hidden. If your brother doesn't take it, I'll bet your mom would.", "I mean it. You can do anything, be anything. Just keep trying, keep doing.", "Put a new passcode on the tablet. Wipe it down everytime, and don\u2019t use your finger print or face.", "Yeah absolutely keep this hidden, cuz your mother has already declared that she has intentions to steal it from you. I would suggest keeping it on your person at all times"]}
