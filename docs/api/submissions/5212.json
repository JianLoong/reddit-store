I hate being the center of attention at social gatherings, it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I always plead my parents to keep the celebration small and casual or not do anything at all, but my father, who was always the one who did everything, never listened. My mom just tagged along. I ended up miserable, because the reason we had to celebrate \u2013 according to my father \u2013 was, because PEOPLE wanted to celebrate me and refusing would make them sad and think I wouldn\u2019t want to see them. Which isn\u2019t true, I think the people he invited are all great, but I\u2019d rather spend time with them at a normal day were we could act naturally. My father said I had to pretend to be happy, even if I was sick, tired, in a bad mood, which I definitely would be, or else I would ruin the day for everyone else and everyone I loved would start to resent me for rejecting them when they wanted to show me their love.\n\nTwo years ago, I moved out and live now with my grandmother and am very low contact with my father due to the shit he pulled when I was still living with him. I am in therapy now and getting better. The interactions with my father are more like between neighbours than father and son, and I think we never had such a pleasant relationship before. I have a friend who is born the same day as me and we celebrate our birthdays now together and I never had any idea how wholesome birthday celebrations can be when your boundaries are respected.\n\nFor my birthdays, my father would always bake a chocolate cake with smarties. Last year, he came to me and gave it to and I took it because I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings as it was a nice gesture, but ended up feeding it only to my friends and not eating a bite of it myself. Just looking at it brings back the bad memories and I definitely didn\u2019t want to eat it because I might have thrown up. I felt tense just carrying it and only could breath out when it disappeared.\n\nThis year, I wanted to be able to enjoy myself completely, so when my father wanted to give me the cake again, I politely reclined, said while I appreciate the gesture, I do not want any cake and suggested he and my mother should just eat it instead. This is where I might be TA:\n\nMy mother\u2019s coworker\u2019s kids helped baking and decorating the cake and put a lot of effort in it. Today, they asked my mother were excitedly how I liked the cake and she told them that I rejected it and she and my father ate it instead. The kids were very upset and sad and I feel guilty, because it\u2019s just a cake and I could have given it to my friends instead again (it\u2019s a tasty chocolate cake, I just don\u2019t like it because of the memories) and they only meant well. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671545435, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqpj94/aita_for_rejecting_my_birthday_cake/", "score": 219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sounds like two super toxic parents trying to emotionally manipulate OP after he set a boundary and said no. \n\nOP, I wouldn't feel bad.

That's the point. It's possible that opening up the can of worms to dig into why it's a trigger is a lot to handle right now. \nThe point is, he said no, he doesn't want the cake.\n\nIt was his parents' choice to be emotionally manipulative.\nHis parents could have asked, \"what's wrong? Let's talk about this.\" Instead, they spitefully guilt-tripped him with some sob-story about some kids he doesn't even know.\n\nI don't see him as the AH at all, his parents seem like they wouldn't listen to him even if he did talk about the triggers.", "NTA. You've set reasonable boundaries and we're polite.\n\nIf they were so concerned about the kids' feelings, why didn't they just lie? Feels like they're just trying to manipulate you.

My brother and I were required to always make people like us and never do anything that could make them dislike us.

Even though your relationship is strained, they still go through the effort of baking you a cake - not buying one - baking one. And because you didn't tell them you didn't want a cake (you failed to set that boundary) they went ahead and devoted their time to it because they thought you liked it. You essentially created this situation and threw it back in their faces. Why should they lie to protect you?

Usually, when she accidentally does it, she meant well but it backfired somehow. I don't know why the kids were involved though, but she's pretty good friends with all of her coworkers, so maybe they started visiting her more often since I moved out.", "Well, at least not more than once. I had situations were people accidentally hurt me and meant well, but OP's parents already know OP doesn't like the cake and the celebrations and keep doing it. All the people I met who truly accidentally stuck their foot in their mouth apologized profusely and made sure it never happened again. That's how I knew they meant well. They apologized for hurting me and did everything they could to make it right, and you could see they meant it. \n\nWell meaning people might hurt you by accident... once. And then they'll do their very best to do better next time and not hurt you again.\n\nBut that's not happening here. OP told them to stop. OP told them they didn't want this and they make excuses to do it anyways. That's not well meaning. That's horrible.", "NTA. \u201cOh he loved it! No, he didn\u2019t get any pictures cause it got eaten so fast!\u201d That\u2019s all they had to say, but instead they chose to upset random innocent kids just so they could hold it over you and make you feel shitty. You\u2019re absolutely not the asshole anywhere in here. \n\nI hope next year you have the birthday of your dreams, including if that means just hanging out like a normal day with your friends and maybe having a yummy treat at some point for no reason other than you\u2019re a cool dude who deserves a treat every once in a while.", "NTA\n\nMy (elementary school age) son is the same about birthdays and cake (it was more extreme when he was younger). He has cookies instead of cake, because he doesn\u2019t like cake. Birthday parties were always small and all elements had to be approved by him (which meant no conventional party games for many years). He didn\u2019t like anything where too many people were looking at him or when groups of people were crowded close together.  I find his preferences quite strange to be honest, but it is his birthday so we do what he wants.\n\nThe idea that I would push birthday stuff he hated for years (well into adulthood) is just wrong. It is ignoring who he is and his requests to me.\n\nWhy would the co-workers kids be roped into this?

Another person here who celebrates their birthday privately (and also recently).\n\nYour parents' parties have never been about you. They've been about *them.* Otherwise, your parents would respect your boundaries instead of steamrolling you. They're angry at you for not falling for their manipulations. I wouldn't suggest the extreme route if you weren't already very low contact, but honestly? If they can't respect your boundaries, I wouldn't engage with them at all.\n\nNTA.

Who would do that, bake a cake for a coworker's son that they don't know?  It sounds like a rather elaborate story so OP's mom can say \"I told them you REJECTED it and it DESTROYED them.\"", "I'm not gonna argue for every single situation, but I kinda disagree in the larger sense.  IMO, part of \"meaning well\" is knowing what that would even look like in the first place.  Can't \"mean well\" if you don't even know what would be received well, y'know?", "I get were you coming from but there are a lot of common things that can be traumatising for sime people.\n\nIf, like in this case, OP got a new job, and by chance, a colleague happened to give them a similar cake for their birthday, not knowing about OP's past, that would be a typical case of people meaning well. But those people would for sure apologize and not try that again if they found out. And since the vast majority of people have no problems with receiving a chocolate birthday cake, this is something that could easily happen. It's not unusual to do something nice for the people you're working with and you're not required to ask everyone if they're traumatised by cake.\n\nBut as soon as you know it's different. Yes, it's unusual, but that doesn't make OPs feelings less valid. A well meaning person will stop their behaviour as soon as they learn it's unwelcome in such a situation and not try to argue this. \n\nPeople carry baggage, and it's impossible to get it right every time. But as soon as you know and as long as it's reasonable, you accommodate people if you learn you've hurt them despite best intentions.", "I don't think you're an asshole and I don't know the ins and outs of your personal life. My only thing is knowing that your dad does this every year for you, I would have mentioned beforehand that you didn't want a cake this year before waiting for your dad to bake it and give it to you. Maybe see if your parents would be interested in going to therapy with you, not necessarily your job but kids tend to naturally have some sort of trauma growing up under a house where parents see the world differently from themselves.
