I hate being the center of attention at social gatherings, it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I always plead my parents to keep the celebration small and casual or not do anything at all, but my father, who was always the one who did everything, never listened. My mom just tagged along. I ended up miserable, because the reason we had to celebrate \u2013 according to my father \u2013 was, because PEOPLE wanted to celebrate me and refusing would make them sad and think I wouldn\u2019t want to see them. Which isn\u2019t true, I think the people he invited are all great, but I\u2019d rather spend time with them at a normal day were we could act naturally. My father said I had to pretend to be happy, even if I was sick, tired, in a bad mood, which I definitely would be, or else I would ruin the day for everyone else and everyone I loved would start to resent me for rejecting them when they wanted to show me their love.\n\nTwo years ago, I moved out and live now with my grandmother and am very low contact with my father due to the shit he pulled when I was still living with him. I am in therapy now and getting better. The interactions with my father are more like between neighbours than father and son, and I think we never had such a pleasant relationship before. I have a friend who is born the same day as me and we celebrate our birthdays now together and I never had any idea how wholesome birthday celebrations can be when your boundaries are respected.\n\nFor my birthdays, my father would always bake a chocolate cake with smarties. Last year, he came to me and gave it to and I took it because I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings as it was a nice gesture, but ended up feeding it only to my friends and not eating a bite of it myself. Just looking at it brings back the bad memories and I definitely didn\u2019t want to eat it because I might have thrown up. I felt tense just carrying it and only could breath out when it disappeared.\n\nThis year, I wanted to be able to enjoy myself completely, so when my father wanted to give me the cake again, I politely reclined, said while I appreciate the gesture, I do not want any cake and suggested he and my mother should just eat it instead. This is where I might be TA:\n\nMy mother\u2019s coworker\u2019s kids helped baking and decorating the cake and put a lot of effort in it. Today, they asked my mother were excitedly how I liked the cake and she told them that I rejected it and she and my father ate it instead. The kids were very upset and sad and I feel guilty, because it\u2019s just a cake and I could have given it to my friends instead again (it\u2019s a tasty chocolate cake, I just don\u2019t like it because of the memories) and they only meant well. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671545435, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqpj94/aita_for_rejecting_my_birthday_cake/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How were you supposed to know the mom's co-worker's kids baked you a cake? And what is up with the super-dramatic, manipulative crap from your parents 'He *REJECTED* your cake \ud83d\ude2d'?

If they truly meant well, they'd respected your boundaries and not given you a cake that rips open old wounds. They're still trying to control you and make you catering to their whims.\n\nI also doubt those kids do actually exist. Why the hell would kids you don't even know care a rat's fart about your birthday cake? I call BS on that one, added drama to make you feel bad again for not doing what they want.\n\nYour birthday is about you. About what makes you happy. People who ignore your wishes and needs on your own birthday so they can have what they want, are not meaning well. They're cruel and selfish.", "NTA. Your parents chose to tell the coworkers kid the truth about the cake when they could of easily just told them little white lie that you enjoyed it.", "NTA. I guess there's a lot more issues to resolve here than your birthday. Your mom could've told the kids you loved the cake, no one would be harmed by that.", "NTA and bringing kids into it was manipulative.", "NTA - you mother was though, she could have simply said \"the cake was lovely\" which would not be a lie and would not have gone into specifics of who actually ate it.", "They do not honor your boundaries. NTA.\n\nIt was their choice to 1. make the cake against your explicit wishes and 2. to tell the kids. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t advocate lying but I\u2019m sure they could have been way more diplomatic with the kids than they were.

This sounds like two super toxic parents trying to emotionally manipulate OP after he set a boundary and said no. \n\nOP, I wouldn't feel bad.

It's a weird situation with lots of layers of dysfunction, but even OP doesn't suggest that the parents knew the cake was unwelcome.", "You do have a point there.", "But he set a boundary this year. That's the point. It's possible that opening up the can of worms to dig into why it's a trigger is a lot to handle right now. \nThe point is, he said no, he doesn't want the cake.\n\nIt was his parents' choice to be emotionally manipulative.\nHis parents could have asked, \"what's wrong? Let's talk about this.\" Instead, they spitefully guilt-tripped him with some sob-story about some kids he doesn't even know.\n\nI don't see him as the AH at all, his parents seem like they wouldn't listen to him even if he did talk about the triggers."]}
