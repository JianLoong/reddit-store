We\u2019ve know each other since I was a freshman in high school and reconnected back in 2020. He\u2019s had this best friend who we\u2019ll call \u201cB\u201d (23, Mexican) since he was a freshman in high school. My fianc\u00e9 thinks of B as family because of how much stuff they went through together. \n\nFast forward to my fianc\u00e9 and I first dating, he told his friends not to use the n word around me as it\u2019s disrespectful right? Well my fianc\u00e9 introduced me to all his friends (B included) and B used the n word profusely in front of me knowing how I don\u2019t tolerate that. My fianc\u00e9 (at the time) laughed and said \u201c I already warned him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. So that being my first impression of him, I already didn\u2019t like him. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, my fianc\u00e9 was showing me something in his group chat with all of his friends. I see a text from B and it says \u201cgo hang out with your cotton picking wife while you eat rocks\u201d. I obviously confronted my fianc\u00e9 about this and he got pretty defensive about it. He said he was sorry B said that about me but tried to basically back up B saying things like \u201che always says stupid stuff, he doesn\u2019t mean it\u201d \u201cit\u2019s how we joke around\u201d \u201che doesn\u2019t know that\u2019s wrong to say\u201d. Mind you B is a grown ass man.. Then my fianc\u00e9 tried to defend it again by saying \u201che\u2019s been my brother since high school when no one else wanted to be my friend\u201d.. stuff like that. \n\nI explained to him that if my family or friends ever said something racist towards him I\u2019m dropping them without hesitation. He said he understood but that he\u2019s know B longer than he\u2019s known me. My fianc\u00e9 said he\u2019d drop B as a friend, only problem is they all play together on a game called FIFA, and if my fianc\u00e9 were to stop talking to B then all his other friends might drop him. Basically my fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t drop him because he\u2019s scared of losing friends. I genuinely don\u2019t know what to do in this situation.\n\nUpdate: Thank you to everyone leaving their opinions in the comments, I greatly appreciate you guys taking a minute to say something\u2764\ufe0f Now I\u2019m just trying to think how I can even bring these points up to him. The last couple times I tried he got pretty defensive and exploded (started ranting about who am I to tell him who he can be friends with, how everybody around him hasn\u2019t supported him, how he\u2019s done everything for himself even though I, his family, and friends have done so much :( ) (he did apologize for blowing up on me though)", "created_utc": 1689296781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14z24ii/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_to_drop_his_best_friend/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was devastated when we ended our engagement.  It wasn\u2019t until well after our relationship ended that I was able to understand how poorly he treated me.  I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s now and I am SO incredibly thankful that relationship ended.  I cannot imagine how poorly my life would have gone if I had married that man.  Sometimes it is truly a blessing when relationships don\u2019t work out.  5 years from now, you are going to be SO glad that you\u2019re not tied to this guy for life. Your life is going to be so much better without you.", "you need to travel more.", "B isn't really the problem here. Your partner is. If he tolerates this and then explodes when you mention it, things aren't going to change. By blowing up he basically just turns the table and makes you feel guilty for something you shouldn't feel guilty about. While you can't tell him who he can be friends with or not, him direspecting you in this way only shows where his priorities are. And unfortunately its not you.", "\u2026they had to be told not to use the N word? Now, I\u2019m white. Very white. So maybe there\u2019s some kind of levels? Like a person of color who isn\u2019t black can use it but only when not around someone who is black?\n\nBecause where I stand? Using the N word at all when you\u2019re not black is racist. NTA and don\u2019t marry a dude whose response to people being racist to you is \u201coh well, I tried, lol\u201d. Because that\u2019s a racist who doesn\u2019t stand up for you.", "NTA\n\nbut you make me sad for you.\n\nHe's said that you, his fianc\u00e9e, the person he plans on \"Becoming one\" with in marriage is less important than his friend--because he's known him longer.\n\nYeah, time is NOT everything.  You are supposed to be the person he wants to have a life with.  His partner.\n\nHe's already told you through his choices and actions that he doesn't see you as a true partner.  You have LESS value to him than this friend.\n\nForgive me if that seems harsh, but I would hate to see you in a marriage with kids with him constantly ignoring your needs for basic human respect.  Will your kids be called the N word?  Will there be other racist comments?  Will Fianc\u00e9 bother to protect THEM?? He certainly won't have known them as long as his friend.", "Nta. I hope you are able to evaluate your circumstances neutrally to analyze not just how the friend behaves, but how your fianc\u00e9 allows you to be treated. Would you encourage your friend to stay if you saw that their fianc\u00e9 had no problem hearing racist/degrading remarks about them?", "NTA. He is showing you who he is. Believe him. He will not defend you when it comes to his racist friend. Instead he directs his anger at you. What happens if you have kids? Or Bs racist attacks get worse? His disrespect needs to be addressed. Either your bf is a coward or he\u2019s low key racist himself.", "NTA - There is nowhere that this can go that does not end in tragedy. If you think the friend is ugly now, just wait until you are married and you two have children. Imagine how you (and your children) will feel when the friend starts calling your biracial children derogatory names for both their black heritage and their mixed ethnicity, and the father backs up the friend rather than you and your children.", "Drop your fiance \ud83e\udd72 He does not respect you at all.", "Nta why are you staying with a man who doesn\u2019t stand up for you and clearly loves his bff more.", "If his other friends are willing to ditch him just because he stands up against racism, then maybe they're not such great friends after all. It's time for your fianc\u00e9 to surround himself with people who actually value him and his relationship with you.", "Your fianc\u00e9 is racist. And a coward without morals or character. \n\nIf you marry this person, you will be miserable because he will finally feel like he has you in a position to be as racist as he wants overtly, to your face, and you won't do shit about it. And he will be right because you would have married him knowing he is a racist in the first place. \n\nThis man does not love you or care about you. Playing a fucking video game with a bunch of racist douchebags is literally more important than his future WIFE. \n\nNTA but it you marry this guy, you will have no one to blame but yourself for the resulting misery.", "NTA the friend sucks and to a degree so does your fianc\u00e9. Rather it sounds like your fianc\u00e9 has a lot of growing up to do. He's reliant on a racist friend and scared to lose friends from a video game to the point where he doesn't back you in a very simple situation. He's going to look back at this in ten years and wonder what the hell was he thinking. Hopefully you'll still be with him, but think you should do some serious contemplation on the matter", "NTA\n\nStop calling him your fianc\u00e9, and start calling him your ex.", "Girl leave this man. He's racist, doesn't support you, and you've barely been together at your young age (not to mention that three years is big  age gap when you're 19... that's a whole stage of life tbh) and he cares more about FIFA than being a good bf. Your edit says you're scared to bring this up. \n\nPlease do not hitch yourself to this man. Any one of those could be a dealbreaker. Literally leave in the night and don't look back.", "Why do so many women put up with crappy men when they deserve better ?         \nLook at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself \u2018I Deserve Better\u2019          \nBecause you do.      \nYou deserve a man that will stand up for you, who will be in your corner, who will not let ANYBODY disrespect you no matter who they are.       \nFamily or friend if he truly loves you he will not let this AH disrespect you.          \nHis friend is a racist and the fact that your fianc\u00e9 defends what he is saying and has even laughed at it tells me your fianc\u00e9 is racist too", "Seriously you need to leave him if he allows people to talk about you this way he doesn't respect you", "You think this is racist, but this shows how far boys groups are to girls.\n\nBoys groups make fun of each other. If you were fat, B'd joke about that. It's not about you at all, it's a friendly poke at your fiance. Your fiance is bulling B just as hard, right?\n\nIf he says that in front of you - you can tell him off and say you won't tolerate that. But on talks when you're not around it's really not against you and just how guys communicate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't agree that my fiance would decide who my friends are and if you try to isolate him from them, be ready to be dumped.  \n\n\nYou're not the AH because you have the right to demand this isn't said to your face and even to not invite this dude to your home but don't demand your fiance cutting off contacts.", "NTA. I am a white dude who has previously dated black women, and I would never allow other white dudes to make them uncomfortable. Your boyfriend should make you his #1 priority, and have your back before anyone else. That includes biological family. In my experience Hispanic people tend to joke about race in a very open way, but this is not ok if it makes OP uncomfortable. OP\u2019s boyfriend should immediately shut his friend down when the banter becomes disrespectful.", "love, do NOT marry this man. Even if you were not Black, it's still unacceptable for someone to say that. Why is your fiance encouraging this behavior? And the fact that instead of telling his friend not to do that or dropping him, he decides to blow up on you shows a lot about his behavior. I genuinely believe you need to end this relationship. You're gonna get stuck with this racist a-hole.", "NTA for having this boundary or request. YTA FOR STAYING WITH A CLEARLY RACIST DUDE. Or atleast passively racist (or ignorantly but come on he\u2019s dating a woman of color he doesn\u2019t get to plead ignorant) or he would have STOOD UP FOR YOU. They shouldn\u2019t say the N-word whether you are there or not and clearly B feels he runs the show.", "100% NTA, I believe you don't need that toxic behavior in your life.", "The problem isn\u2019t your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s friend, it\u2019s your fianc\u00e9e. He doesn\u2019t have your back and he\u2019s racist. \n\nDump him, you deserve better. \n\nNTA", "I think your boyfriend is way to comfortable with these things. \n\nFirst of All, his friend is definitively racist. I know some people like that that are all like \"oh he is just joking around bla bla bla\" - and then when you dig a bIt and observe, you realize these are not Jokes - this is what they think, brought up in a joking Manner to get away with it. So this it one of the things that blind your BF or make him turn a blind eye.\n\nYour BF has to realize that and act accordingly. His roots with this guy go deep, i can understand that, and having to deal with stgh like that sucks. But now he finds out his friend is racist, and some root-clipping needs to be done. \n\nThis is also kinda a test for your future relationship.  Do not marry him before he got around and acted accordingly. And do not Start a family. If he cannot get around to accepting your point of view and being in your corner, i do not think this has a future unfortunately. There are many racists out there, you do not need one as the closest buddy of your husband. This goes deeper than you being at odds with his friends or not vibing with him. \n\nAt least it js also very disrepectful, and your bf giving it a pass shows some worrying wide blind spots. \n\nNta. Many greetings from germany.", "Should've asked him if he also sees nothing wrong if she told him to get his lazy bean eater ass back to sepia filter land, he still got a wall to build", "Absolutely! Pls reconsider this relationship OP", "Dude's an asshole new friends won't change that. Rather I think there's a reason why nobody else wantef anything to do with him.", "Agreed.", "SERIOUSLY? OMG OP U NEED TO LEAVE HIM"]}
