We\u2019ve know each other since I was a freshman in high school and reconnected back in 2020. He\u2019s had this best friend who we\u2019ll call \u201cB\u201d (23, Mexican) since he was a freshman in high school. My fianc\u00e9 thinks of B as family because of how much stuff they went through together. \n\nFast forward to my fianc\u00e9 and I first dating, he told his friends not to use the n word around me as it\u2019s disrespectful right? Well my fianc\u00e9 introduced me to all his friends (B included) and B used the n word profusely in front of me knowing how I don\u2019t tolerate that. My fianc\u00e9 (at the time) laughed and said \u201c I already warned him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d. So that being my first impression of him, I already didn\u2019t like him. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, my fianc\u00e9 was showing me something in his group chat with all of his friends. I see a text from B and it says \u201cgo hang out with your cotton picking wife while you eat rocks\u201d. I obviously confronted my fianc\u00e9 about this and he got pretty defensive about it. He said he was sorry B said that about me but tried to basically back up B saying things like \u201che always says stupid stuff, he doesn\u2019t mean it\u201d \u201cit\u2019s how we joke around\u201d \u201che doesn\u2019t know that\u2019s wrong to say\u201d. Mind you B is a grown ass man.. Then my fianc\u00e9 tried to defend it again by saying \u201che\u2019s been my brother since high school when no one else wanted to be my friend\u201d.. stuff like that. \n\nI explained to him that if my family or friends ever said something racist towards him I\u2019m dropping them without hesitation. He said he understood but that he\u2019s know B longer than he\u2019s known me. My fianc\u00e9 said he\u2019d drop B as a friend, only problem is they all play together on a game called FIFA, and if my fianc\u00e9 were to stop talking to B then all his other friends might drop him. Basically my fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t drop him because he\u2019s scared of losing friends. I genuinely don\u2019t know what to do in this situation.\n\nUpdate: Thank you to everyone leaving their opinions in the comments, I greatly appreciate you guys taking a minute to say something\u2764\ufe0f Now I\u2019m just trying to think how I can even bring these points up to him. The last couple times I tried he got pretty defensive and exploded (started ranting about who am I to tell him who he can be friends with, how everybody around him hasn\u2019t supported him, how he\u2019s done everything for himself even though I, his family, and friends have done so much :( ) (he did apologize for blowing up on me though)", "created_utc": 1689296781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14z24ii/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_to_drop_his_best_friend/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because imagine their own dad shrugging off his bestie's racist comments about them.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, he should have dropped his BFF long before this. You should take priority over his friends, since you're going to be his wife and possibly the mother of his kids. You shouldn't even have to ask him. He wants to have his cake and eat it, too, and isn't willing to take a stand, not even for you.

However, B is an asshole, and to be honest, so is your fiance for laughing it off. I can see how it might be hard to cut off his best childhood friend, but I'd expect the fiance to speak seriously with his friend about not using that kind of racist language. After that, if it continues, he himself should want to cut ties. I really don't understand what your fiance is thinking. Would he rather lose you or a bunch of racist asshole \"friends\"?", "Reading the edits is raising all kinds of alarms. You try to talk to him and he explodes at you? This is a preview of married life with him. You deserve a partner who will defend you and not lash out unpredictably when you raise concerns.

If my fiance repeatedly let his friend(s) disrespect me in such a crass way, I'd be out the door in 0 seconds flat. Being married means you come first, and that includes friendships. If you had a child with this man, would the friend continue to say nasty words regarding your child too? I am not sure I wouldn't punch someone if they said racist things about my daughter.

That your fianc\u00e9 continues to double down and remains \u2018best friends\u2019 with a bigot shows that he condones that way of thinking. Telling you he\u2019s sorry, and not following through with doing literally the bare minimum of -showing- you, through actions, that you\u2019re the most important person to him speaks volumes.

Maybe because of this issue again or maybe because of something else.

Don\u2019t marry him.", "NTA. You should explain your boundaries to him like this:\n\nFiance, I know he's your best friend, but I must do what is best for me. It's been years of me enduring racist jokes from B, and I'm tired. I am so tired. I realized that you'll never defend me of be on my side when it comes to B, and that's ok, he's your best friend. But, I must do what is best for me, and if I have to remove myself from this environment, I will.\n\nI'm not asking you to do anything, I'm telling you what I'll do. It's your live and your choices, but your choices affect me, so I must do what's best for me.\n\nHe won't be able to argue that you're forcing him to do anything, but he either realizes that he's taking you for granted and not protecting you from blatant racism, or he chooses to stay with his racist friend.

It\u2019s not joking or funny.  It\u2019s disrespectful and racist.  And instead of defending you and standing up for you, the man you\u2019re supposed to be getting married to is upset that if he doesn\u2019t hang out with his friend anymore, he won\u2019t be included in video games?! He actually said to you that he has known this friend longer than you?! \n\nIf he can\u2019t prioritize you, his soon to be wife, over his racist friend, DON\u2019T MARRY HIM.", "NTA. Why the fuck are any Mexicans using the N-word at all, and why is your fianc\u00e9 okay with excusing blatant racism, especially towards the woman he wants to marry???

Who you surround yourself with reflect you as a person, your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t exempt from that. Him defending his obviously racist and cruel remarks and passing them off as a joke means B says way worse things and probably won\u2019t stop because your fianc\u00e9 laughing at/with them is only enabling him further. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that, I hope you can figure out what\u2019s best for you and your future.

But, you can't get your partner to control what his friends say either. Sometimes friendships are based around sht talking, that honestly is just how some friendships speak to one another, and there is probably no merit behind it. If your partner glazes over it, and excuses it as that being how he always is, it probably isn't just you - the friend probably sht talks everyone. It isn't something to take to heart, I would say. But you can't expect your partner to change the dynamic of his social circle, he is a grown person, who can surround himself with who he wants to.
