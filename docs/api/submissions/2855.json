I said, sure, whatever. We cleared it with Rachel who said yes.\n\nBack to this evening. As we we were eating, Anna told Katie, to \u201ctell (me) what he\u2019s doing in a couple of months.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. I was told that we were taking her to see Hairspray. I was upset (bc I know how expensive shows are and Anna didn't discuss that as an option with me) but didn't say anything. \n\nLater, Anna made some comment about she\u2019s not drinking right now. Kinda outta the blue. \n\nAs some more backstory, we are trying to have kids. She\u2019s told 4 groups of people so far: her parents, my best friend, one of her friends and her best friend. At no point has she asked me if I feel comfortable with her telling everyone, and quite honestly every time she does it, she can tell it makes me uncomfortable. She\u2019s even made comments about how embarrassed I look a few of the times. I\u2019ve also expressed discomfort at telling people at least once, but she continues to do so. IMO, having kids is a deeply personal choice, and so is the decision about whether or not to tell people you are. I feel as though she\u2019s robbed me of having any input in the second decision.\n\nSo when she made that comment in front of my family, I was upset about this too bc I know she wanted them to ask why so she could tell them. Luckily for me, David and Alice were oblivious.\n\nAnother thing was that after Katie and Rachel left, she made a comment about how she was going to use Katie to drag me to more musicals (I loathe musicals, Anna loves them).\n\nAfter I finished buying the tickets, she could tell I was upset and asked me why. I explained it to her. She immediately got defensive. From her point of view, we only spent $35 on Katie. I explained to her that no, we essentially spent $150 on Katie because we wouldn\u2019t be buying Hairspray tickets for ourselves if it wasn\u2019t Katie\u2019s gift. Her argument for telling people about us trying to have kids without talking to me first is that \u201cit\u2019s her body.\u201d Sure, that\u2019s true, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that having kids and telling people you are trying are both deeply personal decisions and she didn\u2019t factor my comfort level into the decision to broadcast it. It feels like an abject lack of respect for my wishes. She claimed I was an asshole and that I ruined her night.", "created_utc": 1669000676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0ny65/aita_for_telling_my_wife_why_i_was_upset_on_her/", "score": 525, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For the niece\u2019s gift, she suggested an experience gift and you blew it off by saying \u201csure, whatever.\u201d Sounds to me like you didn\u2019t care. You should have said, \u201cSure, do you have any ideas? I\u2019d like to keep the cost under $X amount.\u201d She should have told you when she decided on the musical so you could discuss it.\n\nFor the baby issue, I get that you feel a way about it. Your wife also feels a way about it, and right or wrong, women usually bear the brunt of fertility issues. She probably needs support from family and friends. But, she should take your feelings into account since you\u2019re uncomfortable with it. A good compromise would be she shares with her closest relatives and best friend, but no one else.\n\nI\u2019m going to say ESH since you both need to work on communication.", "Where the hell can you get 3 show tickets for $150!?!", "Info: Did she say she wasn\u2019t drinking or that you were trying to get pregnant? People cannot drink alcohol for a bunch of reasons that are unrelated to pregnancy. \n\nI think you and your wife need to talk to a counselor. Why do you not want people knowing? Why do you think she does?", "INFO\n\nSo why can't she tell her friends and parents you all are trying to have kids. It's kind of obvious at some point there's a chance married folks will have kids. She's allowed to have support from other people outside of you about that. \n\nAlso there is no correlation between that and the ticket thing but this sounds like because you're upset she's talking to others about trying to have kids, everything she is doing is annoying you.", "I\u2019m leaning YTA. \n\nI would normally vote ESH in a situation like this, but you\u2019re coming across as very self centred. Why isn\u2019t she allowed to tell the people close to her that you guys are trying for a baby? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re hoping to succeed and become pregnant? At which point people would know that you\u2019ve been trying, no? \n\nAnd if people knowing makes you uncomfortable, you guys need to discuss and find a compromise. Expecting her not to tell anyone is unreasonable. \n\nRegarding the whole musical thing, here\u2019s my take. The opportunities we get to share an experience with our partner and bring them genuine joy are unfortunately finite. You\u2019ve chosen to share your life with Anna, would a few musicals a year really kill you?", "NTA. I think you\u2019re right that she was inconsiderate, about the tickets, and used the kids bday as an excuse to go to a show she wanted to see. BUT, the kid thing needs to be a way larger discussion. Some people are very excited about getting pregnant, and want to share it with the world. If she\u2019s one of those people, and you\u2019re not, that\u2019s a huge issue. It\u2019s going to have to be a compromise, and you\u2019ll both have to examine why you feel the way you do. Neither of you are wrong, and IMO neither of you are the sole decision maker about how to approach it. Figure out how to meet it in middle.", "ESH. You both need to learn how to communicate more effectively. You being uncomfortable with telling people is understandable but her being excited to tell people is also understandable.\n\nYou'll both need to learn to look at and understand each others perspectives.", "YTA. \n\nShe gets to tell people if you guys are trying for kids and so do you. If you don\u2019t want to talk with others about it, great, but your lives aren\u2019t lived in a vacuum - she has other people she\u2019ll want to talk about this with  and should be able to talk about it with. Also, with her comment about not drinking, you assumed her intention and let your assumption sour your mood, not anything she actually did.\n\nYou also agreed to buying your niece an experience. She should have talked to you about it, but IMO $150 for something your wife and niece will enjoy and have a fond memory of for years to come isn\u2019t that steep of a price to pay. And if she loves musicals for the love of god go see some musicals with her - just like how you want her to take an interest and support things you like.", "This is an odd post tbh. You don\u2019t seem terribly engaged in anything. She said she was going to get tickets, she got tickets, and now you\u2019re upset? If you really didn\u2019t want to go to a certain type of show why didn\u2019t you engage beyond \u201csure, whatever\u201d? You could have given her the tiniest amount of information like \u201cif it\u2019s a musical I\u2019d rather just you and her went.\u201d Or even, \u201cwhat kind of tickets were you thinking?\u201d The same is true on the telling people about trying for children thing too, you barely engage or just kind of give her dirty looks or act uncomfortable? \n\nYou mention in the comments that she is disrespecting you and not communicating but the worst communicator in your post is you tbh. She says she wants to go to more musicals, she says she wants to get tickets for her niece, she says she wants to talk about trying for a baby with her loved ones, you are mostly checked out with occasional comments about how you don\u2019t like what she does. Is she allowed to do or say anything without offending you? It really doesn\u2019t seem like it and I\u2019m genuinely asking. It\u2019s wise for her not to drink when trying to get pregnant, but in some cases, it\u2019s going to lead to questions - she wants to answer them and it\u2019s her life too. I\u2019m not sure how reasonable it is to expect her to make up a series of lies until she\u2019s 8 months pregnant or something. It\u2019s tough to say but it sounds like YTA and I can\u2019t tell if you like her all that much tbh.\n\nEdit: also, in relationships of all kinds we all occasionally do things we don\u2019t love in order to make them happy. I don\u2019t like clothes shopping, but I go with my sister when she asks because she likes it. I don\u2019t think the occasional musical for your wife is the most insane thing in the world\u2026", "You should have married a psychic if you wanted someone who could read your mind. When you agreed to giving Katie an experience but didn\u2019t state parameters, you opened a door. The point of giving a gift is to give something the RECEIVER will enjoy - the musical is for Katie\u2019s enjoyment. The choice of the experience isn\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t be) about you. If $150 is too much, please think about how much ANY \u201cexperience\u201d gift would cost - because since Katie\u2019s a child obviously there must be paid adults accompanying her. \n\nAbout your wife talking to others about trying to get pregnant - again, this really isn\u2019t about you. I do agree that it\u2019s a shared decision but, at the end of the day, your wife will be doing all the heavy lifting. Perhaps you should take a deep dive into why you find it uncomfortable/embarrassing to know y\u2019all are starting a family. People are already aware y\u2019all are having sex. People are probably aware that y\u2019all may decide to start a family. Anna sounds as though she\u2019s excited, and perhaps a little nervous and wants to share all of that with people who will share her joy. Again, why does this bother you?\n\nOverall, YTA because you\u2019re making everything about you, when it should have been about Katie having fun and about your wife seeking support.", "I'm leaning towards ESH. You and your wife aren't communicating clearly on things. Telling her \"sure, whatever\" doesn't sound like you care too much about the birthday thing. She probably should have brought it up again, but it seems you didn't bring it up either and she kind of just sprung it on you in the end. If you care about something like this, you need to act like it. \n\nAs for the drinking comment, a lot of people choose to not drink for several reasons. No one asked any questions about why, so they didn't actually hear anything. I do wonder how \"ready\" you are to be having kids if the topic keeps embarrassing you? Does sex embarass you or something?", "nah. I think you both need to communicate with each other better. You say she never asked you if you felt comfortable telling people you were trying..... I can ask you did you ever tell her you didn't feel comfortable... tbh telling close relatives and friends that you are trying is pretty standard... you whinging she told her parents and best friend is pretty ridiculous and fairly controlling imo. It's not as if she is providing daily status updates on facebook.", "I\u2019ll go with YTA. Your wife can tell people that you are trying for kids. The only way I could see it being embarrassing is if it takes a long time to conceive and you\u2019re worried about people judging if there were fertility issues.\n\nAs for the musical tickets, you agreed to give the kid an experience. My question is: why do you have to go if you don\u2019t want to? Your wife can take her. You also don\u2019t have to go to any other musicals if you don\u2019t want to. You don\u2019t have to pay for your wife to go to any shows. I\u2019m just not seeing this as an issue as it really should\u2019ve only cost you the price of the kid\u2019s ticket. You seem to be choosing to feel obligated for all the rest of it.", "YTA\n\nWhat silly carry on about nothing.\n\nSo you're going to Hairspray? And you don't particularly want to! Boo hoo...its a childs Birthday. Man up...\n\nSo now we're to a level of it being big secret that a married couple might be trying to fall pregnant!!  Big secret.\nWhat's the deal? You don't want others knowing you have sex or something? Seems ott ridiculous.\n\nPlease get over yourself. Life has bigger fish to fry.", "You seem to get upset a lot, YTA.", "NTA. $150 purchases should be discussed and the gift/plans should not have been a surprise to you. \u201cIt\u2019s my body\u201d is not a blanket reason she\u2019s allowed to make you uncomfortable without, at least, further discussion", "If you can\u2019t afford 150$ for a musical, you can\u2019t afford kids. It *is* her body. You can ask her to keep it private, but it\u2019s her choice, really.\nAlso, you told her to pick! She picked. Why are you complaining? If it was that big of a deal, **you** should\u2019ve picked the gift.\nSounds like you aren\u2019t ready to have kids.\nYTA.", "YTA", "NTA, if she loves musicals and wants to take Katie more power to her. The rest of her behavior seems immature at best.", "ESH, but leaning towards YTA. You seem very focused on you and your wants, needs and dislikes and not at all on the others. It would be great if you could communicate better. Why can't she take her to the musical without you? But as for telling people - I'm not sympathetic to you. Trying can be hard and emotional if things don't work exactly as planned and having people around you in the know can help you in the longrun. What you are really asking her to do is not be honest with those around her. To keep secrets and somewhat lie. It's very hard to explain not drinking any other way if they are used to seeing you with a glass of wine, etc. and when you are trying, and excited about it and the possibilities, it's even that much harder to keep a straight face and not be open about it unless you, the one not able to drink, are the one choosing to keep this completely to yourself.  \n\n\nIt sounds like you both could benefit from some counseling.

No doubt. \n\nBut to dismiss the man's (your *partner's* !) part as little more than the sperm donor, so not worthy of input in decisions like this is so ugly and disrespectful.", ">Only maladjusted redditors\n\nSiri, define redundancy.\n\nAnd, there's still a difference between \"we are (hah! one of us is) pregnant\" versus \"we're enthusiastically working on it\".\n\nWhy are you ignoring OP's boundary on this just as much as his wife is?", "Because he is expecting her to read his mind. \n\u00bf\u00a1How can she not read his mind whe he is clearly thinking about the things he wants her to know!?/s", "I agree with you. The way she said it made it seem like she was forcing him to go to these even knowing how much he dislikes it. There are tons of other things they could do that they would both enjoy.", "Do you know why they aren't conceiving?\n\nIt could be a medical issue for either of them. I wouldn't know, I am incredibly virile and my wife got pregnant within days of trying each time.\n\nI'm assuming this isn't too much information because otherwise so is what OP's wife did.", "I literally said in my comment that they need to find a compromise. I only voted YTA because OP is coming across as completely selfish.", "Happily married for about 20 years, and while compromising is important in a good relationship I don't think that's what's happening here. OPs wife is using others to force him to watch things he doesn't like. That's not compromising. If she had said: \"darling, I know you don't like musicals but I want to take niece and I really want you to come too.\" Then that would have been a compromising situation and something they could have had an agreement about.\n\nEdit: missed a word", "I think you are overreacting. \n\nOps wife has arranged 1 musical with a family member and OP. Yes they could have asked but also it's not a big deal... It's a few hours at most that you sit in a room. \n\nIt's not like OPs partner is taking skydiving or wild swimming where you're potentially uncomfortable or scared. He's being asked to sit in a room for a few hours. \n\nIf it happened multiple times again you have a point but once in a blue moon arranging something your partner doesn't enjoy and expecting them to come is normal... At least in my relationship.", "You can see Hairspray in Seattle this spring for $49, and the ticketing app is running a 20% off promotion.", "The way it was written made it sound like he's communicated in body language and not directly. I could be wrong, that was just how I subconsciously interpreted how he cast his sentences.", "The wife made a comment about using others to make him go to more musicals. It's there to read.", "And OP apparently got them for $35", "How much is it gonna cost OP to move to Seattle?", "He says she mentioned his discomfort herself. So even if his communication is bad, she's well aware of his discomfort.\n\nIt's also kind of funny you sort of just admitted that you derived your information from the *tone* of his story rather than, you know, the words he wrote down. No offense, but if you ignore someone's words in favor your interpretation of their tone, you're not really in a position to criticize them for their communication skills.", "I did read it, I've taken as a comment made in Jest that OP is trying to make sound more serious. \n\nI'd say the same to my wife.  I'll make sure I mention to my family about the new board games so it will force you to play more..... Teasing her a bit. \n\nIf say his wife did so that every month she arranged it and OP objected then OP has a point", "It happens. There\u2019s promotional deals for the shitty Mezzanine seats, especially around Black Friday.", "Commenter above said they didn\u2019t believe me that there are tickets around $50. I demonstrated that there are. I never said anyone had to move to Seattle.", "Yup, I made a mistake and admitted it. Sorry if that crapped in your cornflakes, have a tasty day.", "No they aren't.", "This one: [https://www.ticketsonsale.com/theater/hairspray/26?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIt6uB-cC\\_-wIVtIBQBh1FaAJqEAAYASAAEgJvO\\_D\\_BwE](https://www.ticketsonsale.com/theater/hairspray/26?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIt6uB-cC_-wIVtIBQBh1FaAJqEAAYASAAEgJvO_D_BwE)\n\nReally?\n\nLol\n\nAlso, you're looking at Sunday lunchtime tickets like some kind of genius.", "NTA you were kinda blindsided by the ticket thing because from what you said it sounded like you were expecting to just give Katie a ticket to a concert or something, not be dragged along and have to buy multiple tickets. However you need to take some responsibility here because you blew it off instead of asking follow up questions and being involved. \n\nAs for her comments about trying for kids, she's not pregnant yet so she can claim \"it's my body\" all she wants but reality is she's just announcing to the room that you guys are having unprotected sex. I can understand why you'd be embarrassed.\n\nOthers have already pointed out you guys aren't communicating properly. I recommend stopping trying to have a baby until you two get couples counseling and work on communicating better. Do this before you're tied to each other with a baby and start resenting each other because you can't communicate so you're constantly fighting. Fix it first so you have a healthy relationship to bring a child into.", "ESH I really don\u2019t think you should be trying for a child right now. You\u2019re not happy. She isn\u2019t ignorant, she knows you don\u2019t like musicals but doesn\u2019t care because she only cares about what she wants. And if you don\u2019t like them then just don\u2019t go. Tell her no. It\u2019s OK to set boundaries and if she keeps crossing them then don\u2019t stay with someone that doesn\u2019t care about your boundaries. You should both be finding stuff you like to do together. It should not always be about what she likes.\n\nAlso why are you having to buy the tickets? She should be using her own money to buy the tickets. Does she even have a job? You don\u2019t have kids yet so that would literally be crazy if you\u2019re having to support a grown adult that can take care of themself.\n\nShe knows it makes you uncomfortable and she doesn\u2019t care. She even has brought up how embarrassed you looked! You need to start being honest with her about how you feel, although she sees it. She knows. But if you\u2019re more honest she can\u2019t try to pretend like you never told her or something.\n\nIs this what you want the rest of your life? Look around you. What do you want?\n\nShe literally said she was going to use that little girl to drag you to musicals that she knows you hate! She doesn\u2019t care about you at all, only about herself!\n\nDon\u2019t forget this sub is notoriously biased against men. Every time I see similar posts but genders are opposite you can see the difference and how people are treated.", "ESH\n\nBut also bang a rubber on it if you don't want her talking about trying for kids. \n\nThat part of the involvement is YOUR body YOUR choice.", "YTA. You seem extremely controlling. There's nothing wrong with her telling people she's trying to have a baby; she didn't rob you of anything. You're just hell bent on making her look as bad as possible because you want to paint yourself as the victim. And if you can't afford 150 for tickets then how the hell are you going to afford the thousands that you'll spend on a child?", "\"having kids is a deeply personal choice\" it honestly really isn't, having kids is a very public thing to do. Trying for kids can be private but clearly your wife doesn't want it to be. You took it for granted that you not wanting her to do something was reason enough for her to stop and I have honestly no idea why lmao your wishes are not all important. You need an actual compromise seeking conversation on this where you listen to her too. \n\nFor the gift thing you simply cannot say \"yes whatever\" at something and then complain about it. On her birthday no less ? Next time you find the gift. \n\nAll in all YTA start actually talking to your wife.", "NTA. I get why you're upset by your wife telling everyone you're trying for a baby. She's basically announcing to everyone \"We're having lots of sex\". That could certainly be embarrassing in front of her parents. \n\nAs for the musical tickets, all the other commentors got it right  - if money isn't the issue, wife can take niece to as many shows as she wants. You don't have to go.", "ESH.\n\nLearn to communicate. I don't see ANY of this happening between you two.\n\nAlso... It doesn't take two people to take a kid to a play.  She should take your niece alone and have a grand of time. Because you know that if you get dragged along you're just going to sit there and sulk... which is understandable, if you hate musicals.", "I agree with others that you guys aren't communicating effectively. It seems Anna has started going around you to get what she wants, rather than conferring with you to make a team decision first. That's not good and will require both of you working on it to fix (she needs to put in more work instead of copping out to take the easy path around you, and you need to actually talk and make the conversations feel productive and worth having)\n\nI do think that the more conservative partner's wishes take precedence when it comes to anything regarding sex and the like. Her telling everyone you're \"trying\" is both mortifying (it's basically announcing \"we're humping like rabbits!!\") and possibly setting her up for everything to explode in her face and destroy her if it doesn't go as well as she expects. Dealing with infertility is emotionally devastating enough without having tell everyone who keeps asking where the baby is.", "YTA after all OP\u2019s comments on here, he and his wife should not be trying to have a kid, they should be in counseling to improve their communication and his pedantry.", "Info: How often do you pick petty fights with your wife on her special days about things you couldn't be bothered to bring up beforehand?", "ESH...  Her & Katie could have gone to the musical, by their self's.  Next time just get them tickets & if your wife is using that as a excuse to get you to musicals.. she YTA for being selfish and disrespectful.\n\nShe should have allowed you to tell your family.  Good luck sounds like she a handful", "I loath musicals also. NTA.", "And they need to pause on trying to get pregnant until they learn to communicate better. Having a baby adds major complexities to a relationship and this one is already rocky.", "The lower prices for tours are around $50 per ticket.", "And this is the kind of ridiculous prudishness that used to result in women being confined to their homes as soon as a pregnancy was apparent.\n\nMost people have sex.  People in committed romantic relationships tend to have more sex than anyone else. (It's easy and everyone involved already knows what gets everyone off).\n\nWith hormonal birth control, implants, and IUDs you can generally assume a LOT of raw dogging is going on if STDs aren't a concern.  A perk of monogamy/exclusive poly groups.\n\nSince that's generally the default of couples in relationships, when someone says they're trying for a child, they're sharing their hopes and dreams for the future with you.  Making that just about sex is just an asshole teenager take on the subject.", "You didn't give enough of a shit to communicate with her. You said \"sure, whatever\" and dismissively agreed to an experience gift with zero input. So...don't now whine that you didn't get to have any input. That was *your* failure to care, not hers.", "Half of you post you said \u201cI sucked it up\u201d, \u201cSure, whatever\u201d\u2026 that\u2019s definitely not communication.", "Yeah I DETEST sports but my husband and my whole family love them, so he and my mom go to football and basketball games together. We compromise on a lot; but certain things aren\u2019t worth it and you shouldn\u2019t force your spouse to do something they hate.", "That would be *her* medical information. And since she would be the one to physically experience any miscarriages, she would have the right to require waiting until the highest risks have passed.\n\nShe hasn't said \"he has slow sperm so we're trying now,\" so she didn't share his medical information. That makes your attempted reversal nonsensical.", "I agree. One of the things I love about having niblings, is that I can see & do things with them, that I know my husband hates & would not enjoy at all. It's a great bonding experience", "You do not find a compromise in public.\n\nReddit is not public if you are anonymous.", "Hamilton prices on my city for next year are 250-600$. You could buy two tickets a month and go each month for $14,400. Cheaper than a baby, and you don't have to change any diapers or lose your sleep.", "I know you\u2019re wife is probably fine with that, I don\u2019t want to guess about your relationship, but it literally just made me upset imagining my partner say that.\n\nI do t think I\u2019m actually upset with them I\u2019m my imagination, just upset I have to do the thing."]}
