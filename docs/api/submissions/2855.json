I said, sure, whatever. We cleared it with Rachel who said yes.\n\nBack to this evening. As we we were eating, Anna told Katie, to \u201ctell (me) what he\u2019s doing in a couple of months.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. I was told that we were taking her to see Hairspray. I was upset (bc I know how expensive shows are and Anna didn't discuss that as an option with me) but didn't say anything. \n\nLater, Anna made some comment about she\u2019s not drinking right now. Kinda outta the blue. \n\nAs some more backstory, we are trying to have kids. She\u2019s told 4 groups of people so far: her parents, my best friend, one of her friends and her best friend. At no point has she asked me if I feel comfortable with her telling everyone, and quite honestly every time she does it, she can tell it makes me uncomfortable. She\u2019s even made comments about how embarrassed I look a few of the times. I\u2019ve also expressed discomfort at telling people at least once, but she continues to do so. IMO, having kids is a deeply personal choice, and so is the decision about whether or not to tell people you are. I feel as though she\u2019s robbed me of having any input in the second decision.\n\nSo when she made that comment in front of my family, I was upset about this too bc I know she wanted them to ask why so she could tell them. Luckily for me, David and Alice were oblivious.\n\nAnother thing was that after Katie and Rachel left, she made a comment about how she was going to use Katie to drag me to more musicals (I loathe musicals, Anna loves them).\n\nAfter I finished buying the tickets, she could tell I was upset and asked me why. I explained it to her. She immediately got defensive. From her point of view, we only spent $35 on Katie. I explained to her that no, we essentially spent $150 on Katie because we wouldn\u2019t be buying Hairspray tickets for ourselves if it wasn\u2019t Katie\u2019s gift. Her argument for telling people about us trying to have kids without talking to me first is that \u201cit\u2019s her body.\u201d Sure, that\u2019s true, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that having kids and telling people you are trying are both deeply personal decisions and she didn\u2019t factor my comfort level into the decision to broadcast it. It feels like an abject lack of respect for my wishes. She claimed I was an asshole and that I ruined her night.", "created_utc": 1669000676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0ny65/aita_for_telling_my_wife_why_i_was_upset_on_her/", "score": 303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For the niece\u2019s gift, she suggested an experience gift and you blew it off by saying \u201csure, whatever.\u201d Sounds to me like you didn\u2019t care. You should have said, \u201cSure, do you have any ideas? I\u2019d like to keep the cost under $X amount.\u201d She should have told you when she decided on the musical so you could discuss it.\n\nFor the baby issue, I get that you feel a way about it. Your wife also feels a way about it, and right or wrong, women usually bear the brunt of fertility issues. She probably needs support from family and friends. But, she should take your feelings into account since you\u2019re uncomfortable with it. A good compromise would be she shares with her closest relatives and best friend, but no one else.\n\nI\u2019m going to say ESH since you both need to work on communication.", "Where the hell can you get 3 show tickets for $150!?!", "Info: Did she say she wasn\u2019t drinking or that you were trying to get pregnant? People cannot drink alcohol for a bunch of reasons that are unrelated to pregnancy. \n\nI think you and your wife need to talk to a counselor. Why do you not want people knowing? Why do you think she does?", "INFO\n\nSo why can't she tell her friends and parents you all are trying to have kids. It's kind of obvious at some point there's a chance married folks will have kids. She's allowed to have support from other people outside of you about that. \n\nAlso there is no correlation between that and the ticket thing but this sounds like because you're upset she's talking to others about trying to have kids, everything she is doing is annoying you.", "I\u2019m leaning YTA. \n\nI would normally vote ESH in a situation like this, but you\u2019re coming across as very self centred. Why isn\u2019t she allowed to tell the people close to her that you guys are trying for a baby? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re hoping to succeed and become pregnant? At which point people would know that you\u2019ve been trying, no? \n\nAnd if people knowing makes you uncomfortable, you guys need to discuss and find a compromise. Expecting her not to tell anyone is unreasonable. \n\nRegarding the whole musical thing, here\u2019s my take. The opportunities we get to share an experience with our partner and bring them genuine joy are unfortunately finite. You\u2019ve chosen to share your life with Anna, would a few musicals a year really kill you?", "NTA. I think you\u2019re right that she was inconsiderate, about the tickets, and used the kids bday as an excuse to go to a show she wanted to see. BUT, the kid thing needs to be a way larger discussion. Some people are very excited about getting pregnant, and want to share it with the world. If she\u2019s one of those people, and you\u2019re not, that\u2019s a huge issue. It\u2019s going to have to be a compromise, and you\u2019ll both have to examine why you feel the way you do. Neither of you are wrong, and IMO neither of you are the sole decision maker about how to approach it. Figure out how to meet it in middle.", "ESH. You both need to learn how to communicate more effectively. You being uncomfortable with telling people is understandable but her being excited to tell people is also understandable.\n\nYou'll both need to learn to look at and understand each others perspectives.", "YTA. \n\nShe gets to tell people if you guys are trying for kids and so do you. If you don\u2019t want to talk with others about it, great, but your lives aren\u2019t lived in a vacuum - she has other people she\u2019ll want to talk about this with  and should be able to talk about it with. Also, with her comment about not drinking, you assumed her intention and let your assumption sour your mood, not anything she actually did.\n\nYou also agreed to buying your niece an experience. She should have talked to you about it, but IMO $150 for something your wife and niece will enjoy and have a fond memory of for years to come isn\u2019t that steep of a price to pay. And if she loves musicals for the love of god go see some musicals with her - just like how you want her to take an interest and support things you like.", "This is an odd post tbh. You don\u2019t seem terribly engaged in anything. She said she was going to get tickets, she got tickets, and now you\u2019re upset? If you really didn\u2019t want to go to a certain type of show why didn\u2019t you engage beyond \u201csure, whatever\u201d? You could have given her the tiniest amount of information like \u201cif it\u2019s a musical I\u2019d rather just you and her went.\u201d Or even, \u201cwhat kind of tickets were you thinking?\u201d The same is true on the telling people about trying for children thing too, you barely engage or just kind of give her dirty looks or act uncomfortable? \n\nYou mention in the comments that she is disrespecting you and not communicating but the worst communicator in your post is you tbh. She says she wants to go to more musicals, she says she wants to get tickets for her niece, she says she wants to talk about trying for a baby with her loved ones, you are mostly checked out with occasional comments about how you don\u2019t like what she does. Is she allowed to do or say anything without offending you? It really doesn\u2019t seem like it and I\u2019m genuinely asking. It\u2019s wise for her not to drink when trying to get pregnant, but in some cases, it\u2019s going to lead to questions - she wants to answer them and it\u2019s her life too. I\u2019m not sure how reasonable it is to expect her to make up a series of lies until she\u2019s 8 months pregnant or something. It\u2019s tough to say but it sounds like YTA and I can\u2019t tell if you like her all that much tbh.\n\nEdit: also, in relationships of all kinds we all occasionally do things we don\u2019t love in order to make them happy. I don\u2019t like clothes shopping, but I go with my sister when she asks because she likes it. I don\u2019t think the occasional musical for your wife is the most insane thing in the world\u2026", "You should have married a psychic if you wanted someone who could read your mind. When you agreed to giving Katie an experience but didn\u2019t state parameters, you opened a door. The point of giving a gift is to give something the RECEIVER will enjoy - the musical is for Katie\u2019s enjoyment. The choice of the experience isn\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t be) about you. If $150 is too much, please think about how much ANY \u201cexperience\u201d gift would cost - because since Katie\u2019s a child obviously there must be paid adults accompanying her. \n\nAbout your wife talking to others about trying to get pregnant - again, this really isn\u2019t about you. I do agree that it\u2019s a shared decision but, at the end of the day, your wife will be doing all the heavy lifting. Perhaps you should take a deep dive into why you find it uncomfortable/embarrassing to know y\u2019all are starting a family. People are already aware y\u2019all are having sex. People are probably aware that y\u2019all may decide to start a family. Anna sounds as though she\u2019s excited, and perhaps a little nervous and wants to share all of that with people who will share her joy. Again, why does this bother you?\n\nOverall, YTA because you\u2019re making everything about you, when it should have been about Katie having fun and about your wife seeking support.", "I'm leaning towards ESH. You and your wife aren't communicating clearly on things. Telling her \"sure, whatever\" doesn't sound like you care too much about the birthday thing. She probably should have brought it up again, but it seems you didn't bring it up either and she kind of just sprung it on you in the end. If you care about something like this, you need to act like it. \n\nAs for the drinking comment, a lot of people choose to not drink for several reasons. No one asked any questions about why, so they didn't actually hear anything. I do wonder how \"ready\" you are to be having kids if the topic keeps embarrassing you? Does sex embarass you or something?", "nah. I think you both need to communicate with each other better. You say she never asked you if you felt comfortable telling people you were trying..... I can ask you did you ever tell her you didn't feel comfortable... tbh telling close relatives and friends that you are trying is pretty standard... you whinging she told her parents and best friend is pretty ridiculous and fairly controlling imo. It's not as if she is providing daily status updates on facebook.", "I\u2019ll go with YTA. Your wife can tell people that you are trying for kids. The only way I could see it being embarrassing is if it takes a long time to conceive and you\u2019re worried about people judging if there were fertility issues.\n\nAs for the musical tickets, you agreed to give the kid an experience. My question is: why do you have to go if you don\u2019t want to? Your wife can take her. You also don\u2019t have to go to any other musicals if you don\u2019t want to. You don\u2019t have to pay for your wife to go to any shows. I\u2019m just not seeing this as an issue as it really should\u2019ve only cost you the price of the kid\u2019s ticket. You seem to be choosing to feel obligated for all the rest of it.", "YTA\n\nWhat silly carry on about nothing.\n\nSo you're going to Hairspray? And you don't particularly want to! Boo hoo...its a childs Birthday. Man up...\n\nSo now we're to a level of it being big secret that a married couple might be trying to fall pregnant!!  Big secret.\nWhat's the deal? You don't want others knowing you have sex or something? Seems ott ridiculous.\n\nPlease get over yourself. Life has bigger fish to fry.", "You seem to get upset a lot, YTA.", "NTA. $150 purchases should be discussed and the gift/plans should not have been a surprise to you. \u201cIt\u2019s my body\u201d is not a blanket reason she\u2019s allowed to make you uncomfortable without, at least, further discussion", "If you can\u2019t afford 150$ for a musical, you can\u2019t afford kids. It *is* her body. You can ask her to keep it private, but it\u2019s her choice, really.\nAlso, you told her to pick! She picked. Why are you complaining? If it was that big of a deal, **you** should\u2019ve picked the gift.\nSounds like you aren\u2019t ready to have kids.\nYTA.", "YTA", "NTA, if she loves musicals and wants to take Katie more power to her. The rest of her behavior seems immature at best.", "ESH, but leaning towards YTA. You seem very focused on you and your wants, needs and dislikes and not at all on the others. It would be great if you could communicate better. Why can't she take her to the musical without you? But as for telling people - I'm not sympathetic to you. Trying can be hard and emotional if things don't work exactly as planned and having people around you in the know can help you in the longrun. What you are really asking her to do is not be honest with those around her. To keep secrets and somewhat lie. It's very hard to explain not drinking any other way if they are used to seeing you with a glass of wine, etc. and when you are trying, and excited about it and the possibilities, it's even that much harder to keep a straight face and not be open about it unless you, the one not able to drink, are the one choosing to keep this completely to yourself.  \n\n\nIt sounds like you both could benefit from some counseling. Or sitting down and working on your communication with each other and finding ways to meet both of your needs.", "Wow that was so disgustingly manipulative of her. NTA.

It also means that if something doesn't go as planned people are going to ask questions if they know.

You need to respect each other and each others wishes, and find a way that you're both happy with, because once there is an actual child, there's no going back. Communication and equal respect is key. OP, 100% NTA. If you don't feel comfortable telling anyone, maybe she could just tell her mum and best friend and let that be it.

I will also say that I think you are largely right about your wife's attitude toward things. I agree with the top comment that you could have provided better input regarding the experience gift, but even there I think your wife was setting you up all along. I'm really sorry that your wife is so dismissive of your feelings and is on the manipulative side. She is the one who is intentionally not communicating with you and not open to productive conversations where you both get to be heard and resolve things together.\n\n1. Wife brought up the 'experience' idea in front of others, before she had ever talked with you in private about what you might be willing to do and how much you all would spend on the gift.\n2. Wife seems like she is proud of how she did this to get you to see a musical. If she really wanted to see a musical, she could have worked out with you the idea that she and aunt take Katie to a musical. She secretly and intentionally took away your autonomy to opt out of the experience or to have more say in what experience you all agreed to do.\n3. Her body, her choice does not apply to informing others about trying to get pregnant. It's about medical care/decisions, pregnancy/delivery/after-care options and support. As far as I understand, trying to get pregnant involves both your bodies. If there were better communication and respect between you two, you both could have agreed that she would get to tell (x people) because that was important to her but was willing to not announce to (y people) because that was important to you.\n4. Your wife is planning things directly contrary to what she knows is your preference. She is not being open with you in advance. I don't know how open you are to compromise, but it's clear that she isn't seeking much compromise. As a wife myself, I'm really not a fan of your wife.", "YTA about the tickets - your wife suggested getting Katie tickets to an experience as a gift, and you agreed. The way you describe it, you clearly weren't interested in giving any further input and expected your wife to sort it out on your behalf, so you don't get to then turn around and complain when she does exactly that.\n\nRegarding the comments about trying for a baby, did you actually have a conversation with your wife at any point in which you sat down and explained why it makes you uncomfortable? It sounds like you were just sulking whenever she mentioned it and expecting her to read your mind to figure out why, then eventually exploding when this didnt happen.\n\nFinally (and I cannot emphasise this last part enough) - YOU ARE TRYING FOR A BABY WITH THIS WOMAN. YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH HER. If you can't even bring yourself to have a simple conversation about something this minor, then there is no way in hell the two of you are ready to raise a child together.", "YTA. She's not a mindreader. Talk to her maturely about how you feel about telling people you are trying for a baby. Do it when you are calm and have an honest conversation. But you may need counseling to navigate this as you have different views.\n\nFor musicals have your wife go with your niece without you. Wifey who loves them csn have fun but you'll save money by not going. Win win.\n\nThat said I don't think the musicals are about the money. You just don't like them. Again, your real issue here is learning to communicate with your wife.", "ESH. You & your wife have terrible communication, to the point you should probably stop trying to have a baby & go to counseling first. \n\nYou\u2019re upset that your wife never asked you how you feel about telling people you\u2019re trying to conceive.

Then you\u2019re upset because she didn\u2019t follow your unspoken ideas about cost & event.  \n\nYour wife shouldn\u2019t be dragging you to musical theater if you hate it.

Your wife can absolutely go to any musical with the cousin and doesn't need to spend money on a ticket for you. That she didn't come up with that is either because she's oblivious or controlling. She can tell the people closest to her about trying for a baby but if you don't want to tell the people closest to you, she should shut it. Also I don't know of she realizes that by announcing it to people means that people will then inquire on her potential pregnancy and if it doesn't happen quickly, she'll soon feel how much of a burden other people's expectations are.

I\u2019m honestly not sure what the compromise would be to have your wife be able to express her excitement over it with also scaling back to be respectful of your feelings unless she only told a few close people. If I put myself in your shoes, I would be the one erring on the side of caution and not tell anyone until I was out of my first trimester, but my partner would be the one telling everyone about it.
