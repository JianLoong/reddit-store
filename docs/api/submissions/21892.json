I love all types of meat: beef, fish, chicken, pork, etc. I have been dating gf (27f) for 2 and half years now. She knew about my cooking and eating habits and never had a problem with it until now.\n\nAbout a year ago, she decided to become vegan. This isn't a problem for me and she has never pushed her diet on anyone, including me. When we eat, we make 2 separate dishes for each of us and then eat together. I've helped her make her meals, and she has helped me with mine. Don't worry, there's no cross contamination and we use separate dishes and separate utensils.\n\nWe have been having serious talks about moving in together when my lease ends and it seems like her attitude on diets has changed. During dinner, I told her about a new meat thermometer I ordered online that just got delivered. I was excited because it connects to my phone so I can see the temperature without getting off the couch! She told me to return it because once we live together, she doesn't want any meat in the house at all. This was news to me, she had never said anything like this before. We tried discussing it and it turned into an argument and then a fight. On my way out of her place, she told me that I'll have to decide what I love more, her or meat.\n\nI obviously love her but I don't think it's fair for her to decide what I can and can't eat. Like I said, this has never come up before and has never been a problem with meal prep. So my question is, would I be the AH for telling her that I won't change my diet?", "created_utc": 1689035287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wbheg/aita_for_refusing_to_change_my_diet_for_my_vegan/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn\u2019t get to just unilaterally decide to change your diet", "NTA - Renew your lease.", "NTA, and honestly, she is being very manipulative and controlling by pulling the \"it's me or \\*whatever is important to you\\*\" card. Run, man, run, if she wins now, she'll never give up on this tactic.", "Wow she really gave you the \u201cher or meat\u201d line, really not worth being in a relationship with if this is how she handles someone not doing exactly what she wants. NTA", "NTA. Plenty of vegans and non-vegans live together, and it works as long as both partners respect the other's dietary choices and compromise when needed.  Asking you to give up meat is not compromising...it's an ultimatum.  Ultimatums usually don't bode well for relationships.\n\nTell her this: \"This isn't about me choosing you over meat.  This is about me being accepting of and accommodating your diet but you're not extending the same courtesy to me.  This is about being able to compromise and resolve conflicts in a healthy way as partners.  If you can't do that then I won't be moving in with you\"", "NTA\n\nSorry you\u2019re being put in this position. It isn\u2019t right for her to throw an ultimatum at you like that. For her to just throw that at you is way out of line and not a good sign for your future together.", "NTA. I\u2019d say that you should rethink moving in together.

I would renew my lease and end the relationship.", "NTA. And here\u2019s what you need to tell her: you love yourself more than you love her, not meat, and you aren\u2019t willing to sacrifice your own happiness in order to meet standards she is suddenly expecting you to change to live up to. So either she loves you and accepts you for who you are and values your personal happiness and views that as something of import to the relationship. Or she doesn\u2019t and the relationship needs to end. Because her choice to have a vegan diet has nothing to do with your diet. And her preference for veganism isn\u2019t a boundary she can set for someone else. You don\u2019t cease to be an individual when you are in a relationship and she doesn\u2019t get to control you or your choices and vice versa. The notion of you being vegan has been asked and answered so either she accepts living in a non-vegan household or you don\u2019t share a household.", "NTA, it's never okay to try to change another person when they are not hurting themselves.

You are both entitled to your habits and diets. You don't force her to eat a steak, she doesn't force you to eat tofu. Problem solved.\n\nExcept when it isn't. Too many vegans become evangelists and expect everyone to conform to their beliefs.  You need to work this out before living together. It may be a deal breaker though, if she is as militant as it seems.

I'm sure if you tell her to decide between you and being a vegan, she'll be mad. Remember to have communication with her. I don't think it's good to move together since both of you won't stand your diets unless someone of you changes. Have a conversation with her, reevaluate your relationship and decide whether or not to continue with her.", "NTA. I\u2019m a vegetarian and would never demand someone not have meat. I mean we could keep our stuff separate and everything nicely wrapped if I lived with someone and that\u2019s what I did when I lived with my parents who eat meat. It\u2019s not all that difficult and I believe everyone can make their own food choices. I eat out with people who eat meat all the time. It\u2019s not a big deal in my opinion but if it is in her opinion she should have broken up with you.", "NTA.

Literally just got out of a toxic relationship where this was one of the main issues. My ex literally told me he was vegan driving home while I was already making a non vegan dinner\u2026 alright. I have celiac and can\u2019t have gluten my doctor has told me to NOT go vegan for my health. Despite this he frequently would comment on how gross my food was, made comments about how my body would be better if I were vegan and honestly just talked down on everyone who wasn\u2019t like him. He started off as a non preachy vegan but it changed quickly and became very toxic. There are vegans out there that you never know until you offer them something non vegan, really do respect them. Diet preferences are a choice, what you put into your body it your choice not for someone else to dictate. For me this developed into much more controlling personalities around my diet (other things as well) and I ended up with an eating disorder because of the constant comments would make me feel nauseous/anxious whenever I ate around my boyfriend. \nAnd we had discussed this before he had mentioned being completely okay with me not being vegan and understanding of that, had mentioned though with kids he didn\u2019t want to feel left out of family meals, totally reasonable I thought. \nNear the end he would make comments like \u201cnext person I date is going to be vegan\u2026 \ud83d\ude44\u201d.

Goal post wasn\u2019t even moved, it just appeared out of nowhere. You get to choose what you put in YOUR BODY. No one gets to make the rules for another person, period.", "NTA. Bye girlfriend \ud83c\udf54 \ud83c\udf54 \ud83d\udc95", "NTA - I'm a vegan too and could never make my partner choose like that. It's manipulative and controlling. She should've talked to you about it if it bothers her, you're also not obligated to change your diet for someone else.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't just get to force you to go vegan against your will. It's not just her house it's both of yours. This is a controlling tactic and gaslighting to say you \"have to decide if you love her or meat more\" \n\nI'd say it's a fair assessment to say this IS NOT the last thing she will try to control and the relationship has likely run it's course", "You are incompatible. You aren\u2019t an asshole, and it\u2019s time to move on.", "NTA. She is doing EXACTLY what people hate vegans for!", "NTA. I\u2019ve been vegan for eight years and it\u2019s very much an ethical choice, not a dietary preference. I used to think I could never be with a non vegan, but here I am, having just (very happily) moved in with my non vegan partner. I\u2019ve been really lucky in the fact that he\u2019s started eating vegetarian (his own choice) since moving in with me, but I would never ever have asked him to do that, even though I\u2019d obviously much rather there not be meat / animal products in the house. He still eats eggs and dairy etc and I fully respect that it\u2019s his choice. He doesn\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t eat and I wouldn\u2019t tell him either.\n\nI want to add that I totally understand that your girlfriend would RATHER you to stop eating meat, obviously any ethical vegan would. But to just suddenly expect you to is unfair and the ultimatum is very unfair. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t have to be a dealbreaker for you guys. Not necessarily suggesting that you do this, but originally my boyfriend planned to eat veggie (not vegan) in the house with me, but still eat meat when eating out or at someone else\u2019s house if offered? That way he wasn\u2019t upsetting me by having it in the house but also he still got to eat it and wasn\u2019t \u2018giving it up\u2019. Obviously this might not work for you but just an idea of a compromise if you\u2019re both comfortable with it :)", "Nta she\u2019s gonna be controlling about everything not just meat", "NTA but you should run. Vegans only get worse soon she'll start sending you slaughter house footage and other pro vegan propaganda I'm speaking from experience.", "Choose the meat would be a great campaign slogan. \n\nNTA", ">Ultimatums like this are a manipulation tactic. She's bluffing, but honestly, choose meat. Dodge that bullet.\n\nHonestly OP, choose meat and kick this person to the curb. Feels weird saying that as a vegetarian but never give anyone power to decide your food choices.", "She's \"testing\" your devotion. Her game playing sucks.  NTA.", "Go to a nice steak house and take a selfie with a steak and send it to her.", "Agreed. NTA.", "And he has every right to have \nmeat in his home. No matter what someone is going to be unhappy. OP, NTA. The gf is an AH, because she gave an ultimatum.", "Agreed NTA. Sure she has a right to feel that way but she hasn\u2019t enforced it before (assuming they have cooked in both homes) and to not bring it up until this point is so bizarre.", "ultimatums over what you eat, unless its someone else\u2019s vagina.", "I have heard the \"no meat in the house\" sort of arrangement. One of my friends' parents have an outdoor refrigerator and BBQ that's only for meat. It works if both parties agree to it, but not nearly as well in an apartment. \n\nI kinda think NAH because it's just as reasonable for a vegan to not want meat in their house as it is for OP to want meat in his house. They're just incompatible.", "This is the best answer yet. Polite, logical, concise. NTA.", "Depends on the vegan.  My brother stills eats meat/fish and my SIL is vegan.  Pretty sure their kids get to choose whether they want meat or not for most meals. But I recognize that not everyone works like this.", "I've been vegan 5 years, vegetarian for 17 years before that. Live with my fiance who eats meat, my son chooses what he wants to eat. \n\nIt's my personal belief, but it's not my place to thrust those beliefs on my family who also have their own rights to body autonomy. They can make decisions that sit within their own moral code. \n\nI still think OP is NTA here. She's already made her choice about if meat or her partner is more important. There is no point making him decide, clearly for her his diet is more important than their relationship.", "Beautifully put!", "\ud83e\udd23also, she\u2019s made of meat, so\u2026if he gives up meat isn\u2019t he giving her up too?", "Oh and NTA", "Ultimatums and making decisions like the gf is doing is an asshole mood. There's definitely an asshole in this story, but it's not OP.", "How is her not trying to control the diets of others, not an AH move?", "My fianc\u00e9e has often said she wants us to be vegan, but is accepting of my \"nope\"", "She came to my uncle shop, he is a butcher. I was working and asked her phone number. She wasn't vegan yet", "No one is born vegetarian it was force on you as a child", "Nah, the gf is being an asshole. Ultimatums and making decisions like that? Asshole move.", "Found the girlfriend.", "It would be. Another fun would be: \"You Can't Beat the Meat!\"\n\nNTA too.", "i think this is what it boils down to - don't let your partner force you change your diet like this. \n\nImagine as a vegetarian or vegan, you are forced to eat animal products. \"you will eat what i eat or i leave\"", "A bit crass but my go to response would be a deadpan, \"If I'm not getting any meat in this house, no one is.\"", "Don\u2019t eat OPP you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s been", "She became TA when she demanded it and gave him an ultimatum vs. expressing her desire for a meat-free home if they move in together.", "Yup. Buddy of mine is vegan & his wife is not. It\u2019s nothing he\u2019s ever pushed on her.", "It kind of is, but it's also something that was said at the end of an argument so I can cut her a little slack for that.  She's not an AH for not wanting meat in her home.  OP isn't an AH for wanting meat in his home.\n\n(Mind you, I tend think most vegans are assholes because they're typically insufferable about it, but that's not universal).", "Did I miss something? Did she say he couldn\u2019t eat meat anymore? I\u2019m just seeing that she doesn\u2019t want the dead bodies in their shared fridge.", "I honestly really didn\u2019t feel like making two dinners and doing separate grocery shopping and stuff like that. I can see why other people would feel different though. I still eat meat in restaurants.", "Are you serious?! I get that she doesn't consume animal products now, but oh the irony.", "No one is born a carnivore either.  We're born eating nothing but breast milk, and any complete diet after that is a matter of how we're raised.", "Other people can think animal abuse is wrong too, actually", "My meat can't be beat.   Do you know the difference between meat and fish?  If you beat your fish, it dies.", "\"Take the meat, leave the canoodle.\"\n\nETA finally got it right.", "There's nothing wrong with ultimatums if the person issuing them is willing to go through with it and not just using it as a manipulation tactic.", "I mean, if she's not willing to have meat in her house, that's a boundary she's allowed to have. Just like OP is allowed to have the boundary that he won't live in a house where he can't cook meat. If she was keeping kosher and didn't want non-kosher food in her house, I don't think anyone would be calling her an AH, but because everyone's gotta hate on vegans...\n\nShe's a bit of an AH for springing it on OP like that instead of talking about it with him, but better now when he can back out of moving in together than when he's unpacking his boxes or something.", "It wasn't said at the end of the argument. He said he ordered a meat thermometer, she says return because meat is banned from \"my house\". Never mind it is going to be both their house but why does she get to control 100% of the diet?\n\nThat's 100% controlling behavior.", "Actually, it was said at the beginning, and that is what resulted in an argument.", "Why does she get to control what does and doesn't go in their shared fridge?", "Yeah, of course no human is born vegetarian, herbivore, carnivore, etc. We are all omnivores, if we weren\u2019t we wouldn\u2019t be having any discussions about the ethics and morals of eating other animals.", "Hasn't meat been an important component of human evolution? Our unique ability to consume animal fat has been critical to developing our brains to the size they are.", "Animal abuse is cooking your steak well done.", "You can't exist without animal abuse, even as a vegan.", "There's a difference between banning meat from the house versus banning meat from the diet, though.\n\n(I was referring to the \"meat or me\" comment)", "\"Meat or me\" (what I was referring to) was at the end.  Banning meat from the house is a slightly different thing.", "I guess that means anyone can cause as much as they like", "It's not her house. They are thinking of moving in together. It will be THEIR house. Why does she get to control when both are paying for the house and the kitchen?  \n\nThat's the AH behavior. \n\nSure it starts with \"banning it from the house\" then it turns into banning it for him entirely.", "It means you shouldn't be obnoxious and proselytize.", "I don't see much difference between 99 and 100 tbh.", "From one pickle to the other, well said."]}
