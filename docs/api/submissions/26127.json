You're not in the wrong for refusing to recommend your niece when her work is subpar. Providing an honest evaluation of her work can help her understand where she needs to improve and develop a better work ethic. It's important to be truthful in such situations, and it seems like her parents support your decision.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not doing her or anyone else any favors by lying. Grandmas gunna grandma and you can't hate her for it, but there's a difference between undying support and enabling the aforementioned poor ethic.\n\nShe needs to earn her own testimonials.", "NTA. You want a recommendation, do a job that's worthy of it.   \n\n\nAlso, if she's going to be cleaning houses, for  her parents' sake look into getting insured/bonded in case she breaks or otherwise ruins something, because guess who will be liable? Won't be the kid.", "NTA. \n\nYou have the support of her parents themselves (who have more say than your own mother) as to why her quality of work and professionalism is lacking.", "NTA - If your niece wants praise for a job well done, then she needs to show that she can do a good job, which she has failed to do. Additionally, anyone who would pay a 15-year-old stranger to clean their home is probably not someone I would for whom I would want a 15-year-old entering the home.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy doesn't grandma write her a refferal - she is not cleaning for you, so it would not be honest anyway.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nI'm pretty sure that if you had wrote the testimonial then it would only have encouraged Anna's behavior.\n\nShe needs to know that when you take money for a job then you have to follow certain ethics, besides if no one told her the truth and shes happy with it, then how is she to know that her work is sub-par?\n\nPersonally, I believe that OP did a good job in not writing the testimonial and telling/showing Anna what exactly was wrong with her work.\n\nIf I were in OP's shoes I would also tell Anna that I'll sign/write her testimonial once her work and ethics improve/equalize with that of others'.", "you're being honest about Anna's work. that's important to set realistic expectations and not sugarcoat things. she'll learn from this experience", "NTA.
