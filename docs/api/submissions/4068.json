So yeah, AH move", "YTA \n\nmy mom worked in the public sector for a while and people brought her home baked stuff all the time. sometimes she'd eat it and sometimes she wouldn't, that's your own personal preference. \n\nbut never did she just randomly announce she wouldn't eat it. that's just needlessly rude.", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't have to say any of that. Not a word of it. \n\nYou clearly wanted to make your point. It's disingenuous to claim you didn't name names. You knew what you were doing.", "YTA Absolutely no one cares if you were going to eat or not. Pointing out the potential cat hair was just your attempt to get others to not eat as well. You do you and stop trying to ruin things for others.", "YTA. You do realize that people clean their counter tops right?", "YTA \n\nMostly because you don\u2019t seem to realize that it is impossible to keep cats off of furniture that a cat wants to be on. \n\nAnd you don\u2019t realize that kitchen counters can easily be cleaned.", "YTA.  You seriously couldn't just nod your head and say, \"Sounds like fun\", and not announce you wouldn't be eating?  You could have probably found a way to sneak in without food too.", "YTA. You didn't have to call her out like that or make some statement. Of course she doesn't want to bake anything now, I wouldn't either. For all you know, she may bleach down her counters before baking. You can't infer that her food is unhealthy because of one picture.\n\nIf you're not comfortable not eating her food, don't eat it. Say you're not hungry, or you're not feeling well, etc. Or get other food and skip hers, I'm betting nobody would even notice.", "YTA\n\nAll you had to say was that you don't like potlucks or don't like to eat other people's cooking.  Specifying that pets on kitchen counters is your issue, was out of line.", "NTA. I totally agree. There is not enough bleach in this world for me to eat something made where a creature that steps in its own urine and feces is free to walk around and hang out.\n\nOn top of that, the woman is being so childish.", "YTA. While it\u2019s understandable for you not be comfortable eating her food, you really didn\u2019t have to verbalize that. You could have lied instead of saying you weren\u2019t gonna eat anything (which makes me question what was asked to begin with), not to mention you definitely didn\u2019t have to make a comment like the one you made. Being a germaphobe doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but humiliating someone because of it does.", "NTA I get weird about other peoples\u2019 cooking too. I watch people I know not wash their hands in public bathrooms, I know how my friends and family clean prior to cooking. People are gross. Pets are gross. I don\u2019t even like to pre prep at my own house for a potluck because of my dog\u2019s hair constantly floating through the air. I get it and anyone who doesn\u2019t, does not understand that there are a lot of gross people in the world normally who don\u2019t even think to wash their hands after using the toilet. My fianc\u00e9 being one of them - who comfortably goes from the toilet straight to cooking", "NTA. Pet people, I\u2019m just saying.", "NTA for a couple reasons. 1. You have no obligation to take part in a potluck. You\u2019re (I assume) a whole grown up person and can make big choices by yourself. 2. Regardless of if people clean their kitchen or not, fur finds a way into food. It\u2019s in the air (just look at the ceiling fans of pet owners), it\u2019s on their clothes, etc.\n\nI get nervous eating my MIL\u2019s food at times. She has 3 dogs she kisses on the mouth, admits to \u201ctasting\u201d what she\u2019s cooking with the utensil she\u2019s cooking with, and has laughed at me when I\u2019ve found dog fur in my food (she thinks it\u2019s endearing or something, idk). Full disclosure, I own cats and dogs and would take no offense to someone refusing to eat my food because of it. My dogs aren\u2019t allowed in the kitchen at all, and my cats are never allowed on the counters. EVER. That\u2019s nasty.", "NTA.\n\nI have this very same rule for why I don\u2019t eat at work potlucks. I\u2019ve said the same, but no one with pets got butthurt about it. I don\u2019t care how clean you get your counters, if I know you let your animals on kitchen counters, I will not eat anything you cook. It\u2019s just my personal preference. People are allowed to not want to eat somebody\u2019s food because they allow their animals on the counter. But AITA are suckers for animals so you\u2019ll probably end up being the asshole anyway.\n\nI get being upset about how the reason could have been left out, but had you just said you weren\u2019t going to participate, I\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve been asked why. And yes you also could have made up a white lie, but it\u2019s hard to remember that just because you work with a bunch of adults doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to respond like adults.", "YTA I'm a mild germaphobe, I just can't do potlucks. But NEVER, NOT ONCE, have I ever felt the need to be an asshole about it and imply/tell people it's because of things like how dirty their kitchens are.\n\nAnd most people clean their countertops, CONSTANTLY. ...Do you not? Because, it sounds like your kitchen is the one people should worry about.", "YTA. Glad to see that your office mates are calling you out on your BS. People do clean their kitchen you know, right? Fine if you don't want to participate in a potluck, but don't make someone else a scapegoat for your problems.", "YTA you could have just waited until the potluck and come up with a kinder excuse like \"No I'm full\"", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to eat it but you shouldn\u2019t have said something like that. Just eat from your own dish.", "No reason for this to ever be said out loud. YTA. Don\u2019t eat anything or just keep your judgements to yourself.", "YTA You could have simply said you weren\u2019t planning on eating and left it there. You can\u2019t tell me your disclosure was a mistake, it was meant to hurt her feelings and cause her embarrassment.", "YTA one thing that confuses me is that u seem to think that ppl cook on their bare countertops?? no one that i know of does that they use plates and pots", "Nah. You could have been nicer about it. But as an FYI I have cats, they are always on the counters. However,  before I cook/bake everything gets cleaned with bleach. So my counters are totally clean.", "Assuming there isn\u2019t a mental health issue causing germ phobia, YTA. You know people can clean their counters right? My cats aren\u2019t allowed on the counters at all but we still wipe them down before we cook.", "YTA and so is the AH that told Beth", "YTA. You can think those things all you want but you don\u2019t say them out loud. You bring a salad or whatever dish you want to bring and fill your plate with that and other store bought foods and no one will notice.", "YTA, congrats on becoming that one person everyone hate in the office LOL.", "YTA. Read the room, buddy. You never go after the office baker (especially when your coworkers adore her food). Just pretend to try out a gluten free lifestyle on the day of the potluck.", "Sweet you attempted to look innocent of not taking a swipe at Beth by not stating her name. And I believe you were pulling the old use somebody else to deliver your barb at Beth though it was a subtle laced with hints barb aimed at Beth that everyone could easily know who you meant the target to be. I feel sure Beth cleans her counters. And the cat isn\u2019t participating in preparing the food. Beth doesn\u2019t allow the cat on the counter. The cat allows itself. Think everybody is mad at you for insulting Beth as well as the loss of yummy food.", "N T A for deciding not to eat it. YTA for saying so out loud.", "YTA.  Just don\u2019t eat but don\u2019t proactively be rude about it", "YTA. I fully understand not wanting  to eat food that was prepared in a kitchen with animals. But you literally could just bring your own dish so you don\u2019t have to eat anyone else\u2019s food, or just make up another reason why you couldn\u2019t eat others\u2019 food eg you have a sensitive stomach. \n\nThey\u2019re your coworkers, not your family, it is not like you have to put up with their food everyday. Hinting instead of outright saying it\u2019s because of peoples pets doesn\u2019t make any difference, you have still made a person feel bad about their cooking instead of saying it\u2019s just you that has an issue.", "YTA- a white lie wouldn't hurt you know. You could of just said you had no appetite.", "YTA. There was no need to insinuate that you think probably everyone is dirty. You\u2019re under no obligation to eat the potluck food, but there\u2019s also no reason to be needlessly critical and make assumptions.", "NTA You don't have to eat other people's food when you don't know how clean their kitchens are, especially when they have a picture to show what they're ok with.\n\nIf someone got hurt feelings, that's on them. You can't expect people to eat food you bring from home, and you've diplomatically avoided it so far by being offsite when you can. \n\nPeople have pets (I have a dog of my own), but there are some people I would never accept food from knowing their hygiene and cleaning practices.

So you can't say anything, just like you've been doing all along, and keep avoiding eating other people's food. But let Beth have her pleasure.

Disgusting!", "YTA", "YTA. Back in the day when I worked in an office setting, another woman in my department and I were on almost identical pee schedules. In the countless times we were in the bathroom at the same time, I *never* saw the woman wash her hands. Not once. Ever. You bet your ass that I was \"on a diet\" every single time we had a food day in the office. I specifically was avoiding her food (most people did - she was famous for not washing her hands), or eating food that she had touched, but she was a nice lady and I didn't want to hurt her feelings. So I just ate my lunch from home like every other day. It could have been that simple, but you chose to shame her.", "YTA. Beth most likely cleans her counters.

You don\u2019t know if she allows her cats on the counter or not. Maybe she snapped the photo because it was a one time thing. I\u2019m sure she cleans off her counters. I have 4 cats and they don\u2019t come near the counters when I\u2019m cooking. They rarely jump up.", "YTA. Why did you need to tell people you wouldn't be eating anything at the potluck? If it comes up just nod along and say something like \"that sounds great\" You don't need to mention that you won't be eating, and you really don't need to mention the pets on the counter thing.", "YTA\n\n\nSo people eat her food all the time.

Finally if you're worried about a few stray cat hairs I'm about to ruin a bunch of different foods and drinks for you....ground up spices and  foods, coffee especially are full of insects parts. Most vegetables are fertilized with literal shit, rasins and other dried fruits have fruit fly eggs, milk has pus. I could go on but it would take too long to list everything. Just know anything processed or packaged that you buy at the grocery store has alot worse stuff in it than a few cat hairs....enjoy.", "YTA. Do you think the others wouldn\u2019t notice if there was cat hair in her food? Obviously there is not. \n\nI have cats and they jump on my counters too. I clean them before I prep food. Most people clean their cooking area first even if they do not have pets!", "YTA for talking about it, not for skipping out on certain peoples contributions.

I don't want to eat her food because I think their will be cat filth in it, be it cat hair or cat germs. \n\nI allowed my cats on my counter too. You know what I also did? CLEANED THE FUCKING COUNTER. It really is that simple. There is more than just cat hair and cat gems in the world, you know. Do you not know that you can clean a counter? You're so worried about the cat but you know some people use a sponge to clean their counters? You know sponges are a hot breed of gem and bacteria?

I mentioned people let their pets on kitchen counters, but didn't mention Beth by name\n\nYou really didn't have to. People don't need a doctorate to put that together, genius. You could have come up with something better or hell, you could have kept that trap shut and just not eaten anything so you saying that was actually deliberate. You wanted them to know you won't eat. You wanted them to know it's because of the food. You also wanted them to know why you don't trust the food. \n\n>Because everyone in the office likes her food, they are all mad at me\n\nYou mean to tell me that they ate her food before and didn't die of some strange cat disease or choke on cat hair?!? It sounds more like you just don't like Beth. If you didn't want them to be mad at you, you should kept your mouth closed. When you would strategically request a day off during potlucks, did you also tell them that is because you don't trust the food and why? No. You just requested that day off. You didn't go into detail so why now? You have some kind of hostility toward her and its time to get over it. \n\nOnce again, you are the asshole.
