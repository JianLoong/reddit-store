You didn't have to call her out like that or make some statement. Of course she doesn't want to bake anything now, I wouldn't either. For all you know, she may bleach down her counters before baking. You can't infer that her food is unhealthy because of one picture.\n\nIf you're not comfortable not eating her food, don't eat it.

You have no obligation to take part in a potluck. You\u2019re (I assume) a whole grown up person and can make big choices by yourself. 2. Regardless of if people clean their kitchen or not, fur finds a way into food. It\u2019s in the air (just look at the ceiling fans of pet owners), it\u2019s on their clothes, etc.\n\nI get nervous eating my MIL\u2019s food at times.

Full disclosure, I own cats and dogs and would take no offense to someone refusing to eat my food because of it. My dogs aren\u2019t allowed in the kitchen at all, and my cats are never allowed on the counters. EVER. That\u2019s nasty.", "NTA.\n\nI have this very same rule for why I don\u2019t eat at work potlucks. I\u2019ve said the same, but no one with pets got butthurt about it. I don\u2019t care how clean you get your counters, if I know you let your animals on kitchen counters, I will not eat anything you cook. It\u2019s just my personal preference. People are allowed to not want to eat somebody\u2019s food because they allow their animals on the counter. But AITA are suckers for animals so you\u2019ll probably end up being the asshole anyway.\n\nI get being upset about how the reason could have been left out, but had you just said you weren\u2019t going to participate, I\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve been asked why.

Because, it sounds like your kitchen is the one people should worry about.", "YTA. Glad to see that your office mates are calling you out on your BS. People do clean their kitchen you know, right? Fine if you don't want to participate in a potluck, but don't make someone else a scapegoat for your problems.", "YTA you could have just waited until the potluck and come up with a kinder excuse like \"No I'm full\"", "YTA.

You can\u2019t tell me your disclosure was a mistake, it was meant to hurt her feelings and cause her embarrassment.", "YTA one thing that confuses me is that u seem to think that ppl cook on their bare countertops?? no one that i know of does that they use plates and pots", "Nah. You could have been nicer about it. But as an FYI I have cats, they are always on the counters. However,  before I cook/bake everything gets cleaned with bleach. So my counters are totally clean.", "Assuming there isn\u2019t a mental health issue causing germ phobia, YTA. You know people can clean their counters right?

You can think those things all you want but you don\u2019t say them out loud.

I feel sure Beth cleans her counters. And the cat isn\u2019t participating in preparing the food. Beth doesn\u2019t allow the cat on the counter. The cat allows itself.

It sounds more like you just don't like Beth. If you didn't want them to be mad at you, you should kept your mouth closed. When you would strategically request a day off during potlucks, did you also tell them that is because you don't trust the food and why? No. You just requested that day off.

You gave so much detail it\u2019s like you wanted Beth to find out", "Find a better excuse to bully her because of your envy YTA", "NTA", "NTA. Pets should not be allowed on kitchen counter tops. Totally unhygienic. I\u2019m amazed that so many people allow it", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault they put two and two together. \n\nI don\u2019t like pot lucks either! \n\nIt\u2019s always too heavy and too junky for my taste", "My cats just like the kitchen bin xD cats r a holes haha", "\"Hey, are you looking forward to the potluck?\" \"Nah, I'm on a diet, probably won't eat anything\" that's how easily OP could have solved it", "I watched the show Hoarders, and the resident of one of the worst houses was often taking in food to her coworkers. Since then I do not generally eat at potlucks.", "> Heat has this amazing property of killing bacteria!\n\nHeat does not kill the poisons the bacteria have already produced, and more than bacteria can be a health problem. Please watch a video on food safety.", "\u201cessence of Fluffy\u201d is wonderful. I have 5 cats so am used to eating essence of each of them - FUR, not poop!", "Most household disinfectants kill Toxoplasma, so does rubbing alcohol. There is a study that says that they don't but it has been disproved. The cyst walls are impervious to cleaners.", "Isn't that just something in cat waste like in the litter though? Genuinely asking x", "If your food has bacteria not killed or made harmless by the cooking process and basic sanitation, odds are it was already contaminated prior to cooking. Likely contaminated from the source, which is a completely different problem.\n\nEdit to add: Unless you want to discuss food handling, prep and proper storage outside the cooking process which is also a different topic.", "No. Heat does not kill all of the things that can make you sick. Botulism, for example will make you very very sick and cooking it doesn't neutralize the poison.", "My male cat doesn't immediately clean his little butt after pooping, so some residual poop might go on OP's colleague's counter if her cat is a little slob like my boy. Ofc a lot of people clean their kitchen, but I think OP's afraid of the opposite.", "It depends how hot and for how long. Heat can kill an awful lot. \n\nToxoplasma can be killed or inactivated at just under 70^(o)C for like 1-2 mins. Botulism needs higher temperatures as the spores can withstand higher temperatures so it needs more like 180^(o)C for a little while and then it'd be fine. You'd have to look up exact numbers to be safe I'm going off memory.  \n\nSome foods (honey for example) in their pasteurisation process aren't heated to high enough temperatures to kill the botulism spores so should be avoided by infants who do not have the internal safeguards to prevent colonisation of bad bacteria in their gut like most adults do. \n\nBut regardless, botulism in adulthood is typically contracted through improper storing of food not letting cats walk on kitchen counters.", "It doesn't neutralize the poison but it does kill the bacteria. How much botulism do you think grows on a kitchen counter?", "Mine spends more time cleaning his butt than anywhere else lol"]}
