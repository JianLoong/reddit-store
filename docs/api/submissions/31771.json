Why are you subsidizing your bff?", "He doesn't pay anything for rent, bills or food. He makes a mess and doesn't clean up. You didn't agree to him living here.

Go to the leasing office as planned and tell them she has moved her BF in without permission. You will probably need to find another roommate. Even if he was the perfect extra roommate you did not agree to live with him and it is a violation of the lease for him to live there. His terrible behavior just makes it worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
