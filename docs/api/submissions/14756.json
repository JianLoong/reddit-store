Without getting into too much detail, there's a few adoptions and half siblings in the mis but I'm close to all of them and while my life can be crazy sometimes, I wouldn't trade them for the world. It's also relevant that I don't have either of my parents in my life and haven't since I was 11. \n\nThe issue involves my close friend, (17f) who I've known since we were 4. For about a year now, she's been consistently posting on social media about her \"best friends suuuuuuper hot older brothers\" and \"the terrible tale of how she ended up in a love triangle with her best friends brothers\" and it's seriously annoying.\n\nShe's never really had anything to do with my brothers, they know her as \"my little sisters friend\" and nothing more so I really don't get where this is all coming from. Over the last few weeks however, it's gotten so much worse. She'll actively tell stories to people at our school about the \"steamy romance that is her life\" and it's bringing me a lot of unwanted attention.\n\nI've tried to talk to her about it but she always says that she'd never do anything to hurt me and she's just \"living her life\" which doesn't even make sense? I've mentioned it so many times that I've started to avoid hanging out with her because I know my brothers will come into it and I'll have to ask her to knock it off again.\n\nEverything came to a head yesterday. We went out with some friends and 4 of my brothers dropped us both off. When we got inside half of the girls in the group immediately started talking to my best friend about the \"good looking guys in the car\" and whether those were the hot men she was talking about.\n\nI snapped and yelled \"Those are my brothers and I swear to God (friends name) if you don't stop using my life to get petty clout I'm cutting you off. Quit living your fantasy through me, do it somewhere else.\" and left, which I feel like was really harsh and probably could've waited until we were in private.\n\nShe called me later to tell me she wanted space from our friendship because I was become jealous, needy and controlling ever since she got close with my brothers, which isn't even remotely true. all of my brothers so far have told me to just stop being friends with her, but she's been really important in my life for a long time and I don't want to ruin what we have, but at the same time I don't want to keep letting her use my life for her fantasy.
