My sister in law wanted to have it somewhere else because of the distance, but I am pregnant, and wrangling my son right now it hard on me, so everyone else said it would be at my place. They arrived late, which was not a big deal, because it wasn't an overly complicated meal anyway. My husband and dad cooked, while my mom and I sat in the living room with cheese and fruit (alas, no wine) and played with my son.\n\nWhen my brother and his wife arrived with my niece his wife was immediately annoyed and accused us of starting without them. We said we hadn't. The men were still in the kitchen, keeping everything warm until they got there. We all sat down, and my brother helped serve. My son \"gave\" me a gift and I gave one to my mom. My brother had a gift from my niece to give his wife and gave something to my mom.\n\nMy dad made a toast about how the mother of his children was the most important woman in his life, and he was grateful to her every day for his wonderful kids. He clapped my brother on the shoulder and kissed my forehead and then gave my mom a kiss. My brother started to make a toast as well. He said he was grateful to mom for showing him how to be a good parent. My sister in law then cut him off and said she wasn't going to be disrespected on mother's day and if this was going to be an extended fawning over our mother they should leave.\n\nMy brother told her that was just the first part of his toast and he was using our dad's toast to segue into his about her. She then said she couldn't believe we all started without her and were being so hateful to her. My mom said no one did anything to her and she should take a moment to compose herself so she doesn't set a bad example for the kids. My sister in law told her to fuck off. I said she needs to shut her mouth and respect my mom or get the fuck out of my house.\n\nThey left. My brother is pretty upset with me. He said I way overreacted and owe his wife an apology. He is also upset I cursed in front of his daughter. I reminded him that his wife cursed first. He said it was my responsibility to be the bigger person and set the right example at my house. He also said this never would have happened if the lunch wasn't at my house.\n\nIt's been a week since I talked to my brother. I don't want my family to be fractured and will probably just apologize, but was I actually the asshole?", "created_utc": 1684900960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qagm4/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_wife_to_respect_my/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They were in the wrong. And also the whole family agreed to have the meal at your home. You didn't dictate, the family as a whole agreed to have it there to help you, a pregnant woman, out a bit.\n\nSo please, next time your brother tells you to \"be the bigger person\", ask him why his wife can be such a little person, while he expects his pregnant sister to be better.", "Absolutely totally and completely NTA!\nYour brothers wife sounds like a very insecure controlling person that is never going to be happy if others are getting \"their way\" or  attention.", "NTA. Why talk to people that act that way? Fuck them.", "NTA  \nYour SIL was still mad that the party wasn't moved. She entered in a foul mood, let it cloud her judgement, and acted the fool as a result. You all simply responded to her nonsense, telling her basically to cut it out. Your brother is probably sick of dealing with her nonsense, hence him lashing out at you to be the bigger person because he knows she can't be the bigger person. She's just not mature enough to be.", "NTA. SIL needs to chill out. Not every second of every occasion is about her.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t see why you owe anyone an apology based on the points you\u2019ve presented. It sounds like your SIL was spoiling for a fight before they got to your place. And she sounded pissed enough it was probably about more than going to your house. Does she have a history of being excluded or never getting her way in your family? \n\nIf there is truly nothing for you to apologize for, then all you can probably do is wait until he comes to his senses.", "NTA \nSIL was just butthurt that the luncheon wasn\u2019t where she suggested. I imagine she was a peach the entire drive to your house and had been stewing with anger the entire time. And Mother\u2019s Day is a day to celebrate your own mother, which is what you brother was doing.", "You are definitely NTA.  What is the SiL\u2019s problem?? Like for real.  She isn\u2019t the only mother on Mother\u2019s Day?   I don\u2019t get the jealousy?   Does she want it to be all about her?   Do not apologize.  You (while cursing could have been avoided) did nothing wrong by defending your mother from your sils aggressive jealous behavior.", "how tf is he going to tell you to be the bigger person when you're literally pregnant \ud83d\udc80 you were 100% NTA. \n\nInfo: Does your SIL act like this *all* the time, or is this out of character for her? Because if it is, I'd just ask her to cut the bullshit and tell you what's wrong with her before you make a harsh judgment of her. \n\n(ex. If she's angry over Mothers Day, maybe something happened? Did she maybe have a miscarriage recently or lose her own mom) \n\nStill, NTA.", "NTA. Don't disrespect my mom in my own home.  Anyone should know that.  Sil needs to get a grip", "NTA. SIL clearly has some things that need to be worked out. I\u2019m curious as to SIL\u2019s family dynamics regarding mother\u2019s day, maybe she was really triggered by everything be centered around hub\u2019s family. Especially since Bro blamed her behavior on brunch being at OPs house. \n\nOy.", "Info: \n\nhow far does SIL live? \n\nWhere did she want the location to be? \n\nHow pregnant are you?\n\nHow old are both of your children?", "NTA. She came with attitude and was completely out of line.", "NTA for asking them to leave. she did overreact to the toast, but your moms comment about setting a bad example for the kids seemed like a passive aggressive jab at your SIL parenting. if she had a problem with her husbands toast, she should\u2019ve taken it up with him after dinner. but idk maybe she feels excluded often and this tipped her over the edge. idk the history\n\nfor this specific situation, you had the right to ask them to leave your house", "NTA. Contrary to her apparent belief, the day doesn\u2019t revolve around SIL. No one should be waiting to start anything for someone who can\u2019t show up on time.", "I am getting the sense that there are some missing details here. Strictly speaking, the narrative paints the SIL as the bad guy. But it does seem that she may be excluded from this family. She wanted to meet somewhere else because distance is hard for her and everyone else shut her down in favor of OP\u2019s house. \n\nOP comments that she arrived late and was concerned about the festivities starting without her. This shows me that the distance really did put some pressure on her to get there in time and she seems to have been concerned about being left out. It may have upset her walking in seeing everyone having already been there for a while. She may have felt excluded especially after suggesting a location closer to her and being shut down. \n\nThen father gives a speech and afterwards He hugged his wife and daughter and son but didn\u2019t acknowledge the SIL. The SIL is the mother of his grandchild and the mother of his son\u2019s children and she probably felt excluded. \n\nThen hubby starts talking about his mom and her feelings of exclusion bubble to the surface and she makes a petty remark and OP and MIL scold her and tell her she is setting a bad example for the children (in front of her children), but then proceed to act just as poorly as she did. Don\u2019t tell someone they are setting a bad example if you are going to engage in the same behavior. YOU set a good example of how to deal with that bad situation with grace OR don\u2019t tell SIL she is setting a bad example. Can\u2019t have it both ways. \n\nAnyways I\u2019m getting vibes that SIL\u2019s feelings of exclusion may be valid although she did handle it inappropriately. \n\nEven if they are not and she behaved inappropriately for absolutely no reason, there was still a much better way to handle it.", "Why would you apologise? Sorry means you know you were wrong and wouldn't do it again.  If she told your mother to fuck off again would you kick her out again? Damn right, so do not apologise.  NTA, she arrived with an attitude and left with snow attitude, do not say sorry.", "NTA\n\nThough I would love to hear her side of this story, SIL seemed to have been looking for something to complain about/be offended over and found it. From the start it does not seem like she put herself in the state of mind to enjoy the day with her family (and fellow mothers). If she wanted the day to be all about her, her family should have stayed home and celebrated privately. It isn't fair to you or your family to have to hold everything to wait for the family that is running late and then be expected to put up with such self-centered behavior.", "NTA", "NTA your SIL needs a serious attitude adjustment. Going off on her hubby for making a toast to his mom on Mother\u2019s Day is messed up. Especially since he wasn\u2019t done yet. She\u2019s got some issues that need to be worked out. And then going off on your mom?? You had every right to tell them to get out of your house. If you feel the need to apologize for raising your voice or cursing, you should do that. But don\u2019t apologize for asking them to leave. And maybe suggest SIL seek some help from a therapist or something.", "NTA. **Do not apologize to that awful woman**. She owes your mother a huge apology.", "NTA\n\n\nDo not apologize. You'll just show her that weaponizing her bad attitude pays off and gets apologies. That's a terrible precedent to set. \n\n\nMaybe your SIL was just having a bad day, we all have them. But she's the one who went nuclear and owes everyone an apology.\n\n\nI'd let your brother know that you'll accept her apology with grace, but you absolutely did not need to sit around while she behaved like a toddler and attacked your mother. TBH, your brother should have been defending your mother as well. His refusal to defend her and insistence that you're in the wrong make it sound like it's possible his wife might bully him or isolate him. Keep an eye on him!  If he's safe then he needs to buck up and tell his wife she owes everyone an apology. Only then might she get one in return.", "I\u2019m leaning towards ESH, but something tells me there\u2019s a pattern of excluding her and probably some tension with your mom\u2026", "Nta.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
