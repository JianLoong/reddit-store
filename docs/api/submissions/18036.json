My sister in law wanted to have it somewhere else because of the distance, but I am pregnant, and wrangling my son right now it hard on me, so everyone else said it would be at my place. They arrived late, which was not a big deal, because it wasn't an overly complicated meal anyway. My husband and dad cooked, while my mom and I sat in the living room with cheese and fruit (alas, no wine) and played with my son.\n\nWhen my brother and his wife arrived with my niece his wife was immediately annoyed and accused us of starting without them. We said we hadn't. The men were still in the kitchen, keeping everything warm until they got there. We all sat down, and my brother helped serve. My son \"gave\" me a gift and I gave one to my mom. My brother had a gift from my niece to give his wife and gave something to my mom.\n\nMy dad made a toast about how the mother of his children was the most important woman in his life, and he was grateful to her every day for his wonderful kids. He clapped my brother on the shoulder and kissed my forehead and then gave my mom a kiss. My brother started to make a toast as well. He said he was grateful to mom for showing him how to be a good parent. My sister in law then cut him off and said she wasn't going to be disrespected on mother's day and if this was going to be an extended fawning over our mother they should leave.\n\nMy brother told her that was just the first part of his toast and he was using our dad's toast to segue into his about her. She then said she couldn't believe we all started without her and were being so hateful to her. My mom said no one did anything to her and she should take a moment to compose herself so she doesn't set a bad example for the kids. My sister in law told her to fuck off. I said she needs to shut her mouth and respect my mom or get the fuck out of my house.\n\nThey left. My brother is pretty upset with me. He said I way overreacted and owe his wife an apology. He is also upset I cursed in front of his daughter. I reminded him that his wife cursed first. He said it was my responsibility to be the bigger person and set the right example at my house. He also said this never would have happened if the lunch wasn't at my house.\n\nIt's been a week since I talked to my brother. I don't want my family to be fractured and will probably just apologize, but was I actually the asshole?", "created_utc": 1684900960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qagm4/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_wife_to_respect_my/", "score": 4519, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She isn\u2019t the only mother on Mother\u2019s Day?   I don\u2019t get the jealousy?   Does she want it to be all about her?   Do not apologize.

Contrary to her apparent belief, the day doesn\u2019t revolve around SIL. No one should be waiting to start anything for someone who can\u2019t show up on time.", "I am getting the sense that there are some missing details here. Strictly speaking, the narrative paints the SIL as the bad guy. But it does seem that she may be excluded from this family. She wanted to meet somewhere else because distance is hard for her and everyone else shut her down in favor of OP\u2019s house. \n\nOP comments that she arrived late and was concerned about the festivities starting without her. This shows me that the distance really did put some pressure on her to get there in time and she seems to have been concerned about being left out. It may have upset her walking in seeing everyone having already been there for a while. She may have felt excluded especially after suggesting a location closer to her and being shut down. \n\nThen father gives a speech and afterwards He hugged his wife and daughter and son but didn\u2019t acknowledge the SIL. The SIL is the mother of his grandchild and the mother of his son\u2019s children and she probably felt excluded. \n\nThen hubby starts talking about his mom and her feelings of exclusion bubble to the surface and she makes a petty remark and OP and MIL scold her and tell her she is setting a bad example for the children (in front of her children), but then proceed to act just as poorly as she did. Don\u2019t tell someone they are setting a bad example if you are going to engage in the same behavior. YOU set a good example of how to deal with that bad situation with grace OR don\u2019t tell SIL she is setting a bad example. Can\u2019t have it both ways. \n\nAnyways I\u2019m getting vibes that SIL\u2019s feelings of exclusion may be valid although she did handle it inappropriately. \n\nEven if they are not and she behaved inappropriately for absolutely no reason, there was still a much better way to handle it.", "Why would you apologise? Sorry means you know you were wrong and wouldn't do it again.  If she told your mother to fuck off again would you kick her out again? Damn right, so do not apologise.  NTA, she arrived with an attitude and left with snow attitude, do not say sorry.", "NTA\n\nThough I would love to hear her side of this story, SIL seemed to have been looking for something to complain about/be offended over and found it. From the start it does not seem like she put herself in the state of mind to enjoy the day with her family (and fellow mothers). If she wanted the day to be all about her, her family should have stayed home and celebrated privately. It isn't fair to you or your family to have to hold everything to wait for the family that is running late and then be expected to put up with such self-centered behavior.", "NTA", "NTA your SIL needs a serious attitude adjustment. Going off on her hubby for making a toast to his mom on Mother\u2019s Day is messed up. Especially since he wasn\u2019t done yet. She\u2019s got some issues that need to be worked out. And then going off on your mom?? You had every right to tell them to get out of your house. If you feel the need to apologize for raising your voice or cursing, you should do that. But don\u2019t apologize for asking them to leave. And maybe suggest SIL seek some help from a therapist or something.", "NTA. **Do not apologize to that awful woman**. She owes your mother a huge apology.", "NTA\n\n\nDo not apologize. You'll just show her that weaponizing her bad attitude pays off and gets apologies. That's a terrible precedent to set. \n\n\nMaybe your SIL was just having a bad day, we all have them. But she's the one who went nuclear and owes everyone an apology.\n\n\nI'd let your brother know that you'll accept her apology with grace, but you absolutely did not need to sit around while she behaved like a toddler and attacked your mother. TBH, your brother should have been defending your mother as well. His refusal to defend her and insistence that you're in the wrong make it sound like it's possible his wife might bully him or isolate him. Keep an eye on him!  If he's safe then he needs to buck up and tell his wife she owes everyone an apology.

Obviously, this isn't your fault, but your being pregnant might be causing her a lot of pain that you dont know about. Maybe your mom knows about this and told her to keep quiet about any miscarriages she's had so as not to upset you during your pregnancy, and that's why she's lashing out at her, too.\n\nAre you the \"favorite\" in the family? Does your mom favor you and your son over your brother and his daughter? Maybe she's thinking \"Great, now my daughter's going to be third in her grandma's eyes\" and is a Mama Bear lashing out for the hurt her daughter will feel when she's old enough to realize grandma favors her cousins over her.\n\nDid your mom not like her when they first started dating and didn't want your brother to marry her? Maybe, even if your mom accepts her now, things were said and done that your SIL may never be able to get over, and the hurt feelings are still there. \n\nIs your brother a \"mama's boy\"? Maybe she feels he chooses your mother over her all the time, and they'd argued about this before they got there and she took out her anger on you and your mom when she really needed to keep the argument between him and her.\n\nThese are just some examples, of course.

Those first mother's days were trying to accommodate the grandmothers when I was absolutely fried. I was pissed at how much work I had to put into mother's day as a relatively new mom.

It's honestly about all moms in your life.", "I \ud83d\udcaf agree.

Definitely seems like a \"last straw\" sort of situation.", "Do you suppose she has a mom, too? Or is it all just about him?", "Thats why we have grandparents day. So his wife had to give up what she wanted to do, on her mother's day, to spend it with her in-laws? That doesnt sound relaxing at all. She's also a mother so when does she get to do what she wants?

Not everyone is a pushover.", "I mean i suggested in another comment that they should split the time. But again, thats on the brother. This didnt sound like a half a day thing, it sounded like they were gonna be together the whole day. Thats how it is with my family. Im not saying SIL was right but she obviously feels left out and unheard. She's a mother but didnt feel like she was special. Being a mom is freaking hard and this was the one day where she would get appreciated. Instead she had to cater to what her husband wanted to do. Again, not OP's fault.
