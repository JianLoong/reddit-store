{"id": 1825, "submission_id": "ypz47d", "title": "AITA for continuing to split the bills equally with my fianc\u00e9?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 (27f) and I (34m) have been together for about 4 years. We met in college when she was a senior and I was in grad school. She moved in together after she graduated and got a job. \n\nAt the time, she was making about $75,000/yr while I was making $18,000/yr. We discussed our finances before moving in together and came to the mutual agreement that we should not mix finances and split the bills equally. The rent and utilities was split in half. When it came to groceries and outings, sometimes I would pay for it and other times she picked up the bill. It wasn\u2019t exactly equal but close enough that no one kept track and complained. This also meant she built up a healthy savings and had disposable income while I was living paycheck to paycheck but I didn\u2019t complain or even felt any resentment at all. The way I figured it, she worked hard for her degree and job so she deserved every penny. I also knew my payday would come when I graduate.\n\nMy payday came sooner than expected as during my last year in grad school, I stumbled across a long term problem in my field and came up with a solution that I turned into a patent. The process of building a prototype, testing, and patenting was very expensive so I barely ate that year and lost about 20lbs. I threw everything I had into it. When I got the patent pending designation, I showed my professors and one of them hooked me up with someone in the industry. They hired me a month before I graduated and licensed my patent. \n\nI\u2019ve been at my job for a little over a year and in that time, I\u2019ve made close to 7 figures in combined salary and licensing fee. We still live in the same apartment (it\u2019s in the middle of our work and right in the heart of the shopping and restaurant district), I still dress the same, but I do have a nicer truck (nothing crazy, just brand new). The rest of my money is either in investments or working on my next patent project. \n\nWhich brings us to my problem. Recently my GF brought up the idea of me paying more of the rent and utilities according to a percentage of our pay. This means I would be paying almost all of everything. She said it\u2019s only fair as I make so much more and I countered how fair is it if I\u2019m paying for almost everything now when we split things equally when she was making more? I pointed out our housing and lifestyle hasn\u2019t changed at all so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s burden by the cost of living. She keeps on arguing about equality and I argue about equality but apparently our definition of equality is different.\n\nAm I wrong for sticking to our original terms?\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\nI don\u2019t know how to update besides editing so here it is.\n\n1. My GF is not a terrible person. I was around 185 and dropped to 160s. Most people didn\u2019t noticed that my clothes were looser. As I spent most of my time studying, working my job then working on my patent, we didn\u2019t spend that much time together.\n\n2. I never brought up the lack of money and food because I don\u2019t complain. I ate at home with her but didn\u2019t eat anything outside. I sucked it up so it wasn\u2019t her fault. \n\n3. Besides this disagreement, we have a good relationship and she\u2019s a good person.\n\n4.  Some DM me about patent procedure and cost. It\u2019s  complicated so do your own research. What i did was file a provisional patent application. It\u2019s not a full patent but it protects my design so that I can show investors without worrying about them stealing my idea. When you get the provisional patent, you can legally use the \u201cpatent pending\u201d terms. I filed as a micro entity which costs under $100. I\u2019m not sure of the cost now since it\u2019s probably gone up. Once I was sure my design was marketable, I filed for a utility patent. This costs about $15,000 including attorney fees. Once again, I filed as a micro entity. I had to borrow money from my parents and went on a diet but it was worth it.", "created_utc": 1667942971, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypz47d/aita_for_continuing_to_split_the_bills_equally/", "score": 1516, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keeping finances totally separate while dating is a different matter than doing so as you get married.

Not wrong at all. If she didn't have an issue when you were earning 18k, then she shouldn't have an issue now. She shouldn't make this into a money grab.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: Wait, you nearly starved working on the very thing that you're now profiting from? And your fianc\u00e9e watched that happen and didn't help out? I missed this during \nmy first read. Which makes things even worse. If there was ever a time to change the terms, that should have been it. I wouldn't now share with someone who just let that happen. Hell, I wouldn't even still be with that person.\n\n\nEdit 2: That Maya Angelou quote that's shared a lot, well, it's very apt for your situation.\n\n \"When people show you who they are, believe them ...\"", "Info - you say you barely ate during the patent time since you put all the money you had into the patent. Did you guys talk about finances during that time? Surely your gf must have realized you where under a lot of financial pressure if you could barely afford groceries. Did she offer to help you financially during that time?", "NTA. She used to make several times what you made and you still split it equally. Now that you make several times what she makes, why should that change?", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s an absolute ass for watching you barely eat, not helping, and continuing to do this 50/50 bs. She has a lot of nerve asking for it to be based on income now, and honestly if I was you, I\u2019d break up with her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to get past the fact she WAS able to help financially, and she didn\u2019t. She sat there while you skipped meals, and now that you\u2019re making a lot of money, she wants to benefit. She\u2019s not even struggling like you were! She\u2019s just selfish.", "NTA -  This is a great time to sit down and discuss finances moving forward. Once you're married, does she expect a joint bank account? Will you be buying a house together? This would be a great opportunity to work out any financial differences before you're legally married to her and things get trickier to piece apart.", "Nta\n\nYou agreed to split finances even. She is not going destitute paying her share.\n\n\nHonestly she sounds like she is going to take advantage. \n\n\nThis is what she wanted. You made sacrifices to afford your share. She doesn't get to call foul now that she makes less money.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't married and she has no rights to your money any more than you had to her money when she made more than you\n\nAlso, you need to discuss getting a prenup before marriage.  Depending on her response to you mentioning a prenup, you may want to put thoughts if marriage on hold altogether.", "NTA. The part that really sticks out to me was that she allowed you to starve to the point of losing 20 pounds. Who does that to their partner? I would reconsider this relationship, she's really got a sense of entitlement.", "NTA for exactly the reason you lay out. Seems equality to her means she pays 50% when she earns more, but when she's earning less it means she pays an amount proportional to your salaries'... That's not equality.\n\nYou might have a good relationship with her but for me, if she couldn't understand this after a certain amount of time (a few weeks/a month) then I would move on. You can't be with someone who is happy with double standards when it benefits them.", "NTA.\n\nAs long as it\u2019s something you agree on.\n\nI personally would never agree to splitting bills 50/50. I pay for certain things and my partner pays for certain things.

That's a huge difference.\n\nToo bad, so sad. Equality goes both ways.", "\"Recently my GF brought up the idea of me paying more of the rent and utilities according to a percentage of our pay.\"\n\nSaw that coming.\n\n\"This also meant she built up a healthy savings and had disposable income while I was living paycheck to paycheck but I didn\u2019t complain or even felt any resentment at all. \"\n\nIt was fine then, but not now?

Congrats on the newfound fortune!", "NTA - based on how you've described it I sense some jealousy, maybe? If your lifestyle hasn't changed it's cost and she is still making what she did and able to save ... why would you pay more when that dynamic worked just fine the other way.", "NTA but you two need to revisit the finance discussion again. The agreement you had is still standing but it sounds like enough has evolved since the last discussion where it warrants reopening the subject. \n\nAnd I say that not only because finances have dramatically changed for the two of you but because it\u2019s also now been four years, beyond school for both, and cohabitating.

Just imagine you would have said something like this before image what she would have done or said to you.", "NTA - i get that situations change, and its fair to reevaluate finances when that happens, but it feels really irky for your GF to go to an income based contribution now that you're making 7 figures, while she watched you starve when you were doing a 50/50 split. I'd be really off put by that.\n\nEither way you do it, 50/50 or income based, is fair as long as both parties agree. But again, reversing course when the deal no longer benefits you is really lousy.\n\nThat being said though, do you see a future with this woman? If yes, you might want to concede this, just because this 2-3 year issue will be miniscule in the grand scheme of things. Plus your finances will be a lot closer in the future. If no, i'd say this is a hill to die on.", "NTA. She was fine with it when it suited her. Now she sees a payday? and wants to switch it around?

Your gf is.", "NTA - But it seems like you\u2019re in for a more serious conversation on the topic of finances moving forward together or separate.", "NTA as long as the living situation has not changed. Her request for equitable split is not reasonable since nothing has changed in the living situation.\n\nHowever, you both need to do sit down and discuss the future and any prenups. If you want to live a more lavish lifestyle that you can easily afford but she cannot, then 50/50 in that case cannot work for her.", "NTA.  She was more than willing to watch you live paycheck to paycheck without pitching in more money. Its not like she's living paycheck to paycheck now to no reason to change things up just because you now have a little money in your pocket.", "NTA I have a hard time with 50/50 agreements in relationships. My husband and I have separate finances but it's always been a who makes more. You do that sort of thing as a team. For example he agreed to cover more to allow me to quit a toxic job I had. I didn't do it without his agreement and expect him to pay more but he supported me because I was suffering. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 watched you suffer too the point of losing 20lbs ( which is a lot of weight) but has the nerve to ask for equity now after no lifestyle change. The practical part of me says if she wanted part of the patent money (or even your job money now) she should have financially supported you at that time. The emotional side of me feels like I couldn't go through with a marriage to a person who didn't support me when times were tough but asked for more from me the second things where sunny.", "NTA loud and clear, unless your bills are now something like 40 times the amount they were at the time. Living on 18k is difficult, 75k is far from it.\nThat being said, be very wary, touchy subject. Then again you probably know it, being here. Choose your words wisely.", "NTA. She wasn't on board for it when she was making more, no reason it should change now just because she earns less. Especially when it sounds like she wasn't helping with food when you were barely eating and losing a ton of weight, which is really concerning.

That just seems like a given. \n\nMight be time to take a longer look at this relationship and her priorities and the kind of future you both want together.", "nta and this doesn't sound like a happy relationship, its sounds very transactional.", "NTA, \n\nYour gf had no issues with this 50/50 when you were earning less because she was still saving. Seems like she continues to look for ways to save her income now that she sees you earning much more than her. Equality goes both way, still remains 50/50 regardless of the circumstances (of course it can change to some exceptional circumstances). Also, seems like there is no actual need for percentage pay since she is not being affected by bills.\n\nIf she really wanted the percentage pay, she should have brought that up in the beginning.

What if you want a house she can\u2019t afford? Is she not going to have ownership and you\u2019ll expect what? Rent? Engagement/marriage change the commitment and it\u2019s fair to reevaluate the finances at that point too.", "NTA, if you take in more of the bills put it all in your name to protect yourself, also I'd think of a prenup or an irrevocable trust at this point before marriage", "Time for her to be the equal.

There's red flags on top of red flags.", "Info - do you plan on always doing 50/50, or only for the same amount of time she was earning more?", "NTA. But how long is this type of thinking sustainable? Are you ever going to be willing to combine finances or change to a split based on income?", "So she let you live paycheque to paycheque and watched you drop 20lbs in a year because you couldn\u2019t afford food whilst she lived her best life and that was fine. But now you\u2019re earning more and she\u2019s *entirely financially comfortable and not suffering like you did*, that\u2019s no longer good enough? Guess we know how she values herself versus you. Think Kanye wrote a song about this. NTA.", "NAH. If I were you, I'd look back and ask myself just how supportive she was when you were in school. Was she cooking meals, buying groceries, or cleaning? Did she offer emotional support, and did she offer any financial help if you told her you were struggling? Put another way, would you have some extra gray hairs if you had been in school and living with a roommate instead of your gf?

Yeah, that makes no sense.", "A couple thoughts: \n\nThey moved in together when she was 23, fresh out of undergrad, and he was 30. While I agree with you that partners should be attentive to one another and care for each other in times of need, she had very limited life experience compared to him and it would be unfair  to expect her to monitor him, a man 7 years her senior, to determine how much help he needs. This is especially the case bc this kind of obsessive, passionate work already often leads to the kind of weight loss he describes. Either way, it was on him to communicate any additional support he needed, not on her to figure it out. \n\nSecond, they were dating less than a year when they moved in together and decided to split finances evenly. That makes sense to me- you don\u2019t subsidize the life of a person you\u2019ve been with less than a year, especially when you\u2019re a fresh grad. They are in a very different phase of their life now and it makes sense to blend finances more. \n\nThird, he was 30 and still had a couple years left of grad school. Even if this was a phd program (~7 years), he had to have been in the work force for at least a few years beforehand. He had savings on top of the 18k a year. Like most definitely. \n\nFourth, yes she was making significantly more than him then. But he\u2019s making f-u money now. He\u2019s a millionaire less than a year into his career (in what seems to be tech/engineering) so his comp is only going to grow. Her paying proportionally then would have significantly changed her lifestyle/ability to save/pay off loans, but him paying a few hundred more in rent now will not impact him at all. \n\nFinally, even if she was wrong then doesn\u2019t mean she should live with that forever. It\u2019s not solely her fault that finances were divided the way they were and people can change their minds about what\u2019s fair. It\u2019s not going back on your word or being a snake, it\u2019s growing up and learning more. It seems like OPs only issue with paying proportionally now is that they didn\u2019t do it earlier - so my question is how long will that justification last? The length of time that she outearned him? Until they move somewhere more expensive? When they get married? Have kids? How long will she be governed by a financial decision they mutually made when she was 23? In the one year he\u2019s been working, he\u2019s already made almost triple what she made the 4 years they\u2019ve been together. Dividing finances equally with that kind of pay discrepancy is not sustainable long term, so something\u2019s gotta change eventually. \n\nAll this being said, if she did just knowingly watch him starve while partying or flying to Cabo or whatever, then this is obviously a different situation.
