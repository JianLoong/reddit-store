{"id": 12586, "submission_id": "11ueujp", "title": "AITA for calling my coworker disgusting?", "selftext": "So I work in a predominantly female office job and I have one male coworker in his 30s, let\u2019s call him A. A likes to try to be funny and make everyone laugh, but in the most obnoxious, awkward and cringey way. Whenever he finishes eating lunch, he\u2019ll burp obnoxiously loud and then blow his nasty burp breath into the air and then looks around the room to see if everyone is laughing. The first time he did it my other coworkers starting laughing in an awkward way and gave him weird looks which basically gave him the OK to do it every day at work so that he thinks he can get the same reaction.\n\nI recently found out that I\u2019m pregnant and have been having pretty bad nausea and morning sickness (my whole office knows that I am preggers including A). Well yesterday at work I was feeling pretty queasy and of course A belches as loud as fucking possible and then blows his breath into the air and it fucking smells like chili dogs, onions and rotting cat shit and he starts grinning, expecting laughs out of all of us. I immediately and firmly go \u201cA, you are being so obnoxious and disgusting every time you fucking burp like that. I have to sit here every day and listen to that as though being pregnant and feeling like I have to puke all the time isn\u2019t enough. Seriously, stop. No one else finds it funny and it\u2019s gross and weird.\u201d He immediately gets very offended and said that he has acid reflux and other digestive issues and that I\u2019m discriminating against his health problems and creating a hostile work environment and that I\u2019m just being moody because I\u2019m pregnant. I tell him that he can burp quietly if he needs to but that he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s been doing just to be obnoxious. Well we had a meeting with HR today and I was the one who ended up getting in trouble for \u201cberating him\u201d and \u201ccreating a hostile work environment\u201d and got a warning. He didn\u2019t get in trouble at all.

Well deserved and disgusting and the fact he\u2019s never been pregnant of course he lacks the capacity to empathize how horrific the nausea and aversions are", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s disgusting. If he has \u201cdigestive issues\u201d he can do it in private or take medicine or whatever. Not publicly burping in common space. He should be the one who get into trouble. I hope more your coworkers will complain to HR if his disgusting behavior continues.", "NTA.  When did it become okay for people to be gross and disgusting in public I don't know. In what world is it okay for a grown man to behave like a preteen but not to be called out for it.", "NTA. It sounds like he was just being disgusting on purpose to annoy people. I think it was very sensible for you to let him know just how much it was upsetting you and everyone else in the office. It is a bit hard to know without being there whether you maybe went a bit over the top in your admonishments but I am going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say it was well warranted.", "ESH, but mostly him. You got in trouble because you publicly blasted him without trying a polite request first. Women tend to be expected to be polite; men are expected to be \"direct\" & even rude. Women tend to get called ugly words if they don't coat their criticisms in flowers & sugar. It would be so much nicer if EVERYONE was expected to be polite, kind, & thoughtful. So your mistake was the publicness of what you said.\n\nBut I completely believe he deserved it. He's acting 12. It's disgusting! He's too thick to read the room & see no one enjoys it, or he can & is amusing himself by grossing everyone out. It's rude & unprofessional behavior. He might not be able to help reflux, but he can keep his lips closed and hold a hanky in front of his mouth to stop the smell. Blowing it around the room is revolting.", "I have a chronic digestive illness that cause me to have very loud burps. Sometimes suddenly that I can't control but 90% I can burp with my mouth close and slowly exhale out my nose so it's not blown in purple ppls direction.  NTA", "ESH. The burping thing is gross for sure. However, the way you handled it was awful and is why HR gave you the warning. It doesn\u2019t sound like anyone has ever asked him not to do it and instead of privately asking him, you decided to berate him in front of everyone.", "Your coworkers is ill mannered and disgusting. \nYou did berate him, so YTA for that. You should\u2019ve known you can end up in HR. Especially if you have the kinda coworker that runs to HR. Of course HR is going to scorn you for being hostile in the workplace. Be hostile at work is a bigger offense than belching, unfortunately. \n\nEverything you said is dead on. However, A should\u2019ve been taken aside quietly to discuss his belching. Actually, the manager should prob handle that especially sense A seems delicate. \n\nHis comment about you being moody bc you\u2019re pregnant is inappropriate as well. Side note, sense you\u2019re just now bringing this to his attention and you mentioned your being pregnant and feeling like you have to puke all the time\u2026of course he\u2019s going to call your pregnancy hormones into play. \n\nI agree with you that A is disgusting. You handled that wrong. Especially in the workplace.", "ESH, coworker is a weirdo for doing that, and truly is obnoxious and rude. However, the way you handled it, regardless of how you feel, was inappropriate and also rude.", "yta for your comment about all the esh being men idc if you were being funny or not and also your pregnancy is not everyone\u2019s problem. im pregnant and my morning sickness is hell. also you did berate him in the workspace and you could of asked him nicely a long time ago to stop burping or go to hr a long time ago if it bothered you that much", "ESH. Both of you should have gotten a warning or stern talking to.", "ESH", "ESH. Pretty sure literally every burp ever involves \"blowing \\[their\\] breath in the air.\" You're assuming a lot, especially that he thinks he's being funny. Per your own post, he says he has acid reflux. \n\nHe also sounds inconsiderate. If you have a problem with your digestive system, you need to consider the people around you.", "ESH You should have just done something peddy to him. I could think of a few things.  I don't think being a tattletale was the answer. Now it will get worse.  I think I would be avoiding him from now on if possible. Maybe even look for a better job. He seems like a bratty gaslighter.", "YTA obviously he's being gross and socially inept, but you don't need to embarrass him Infront of everyone, just pull him aside and tell him it's not ok...", "[removed]", "If you feel sick after he does it,throw up on him. Apologise profusely of course,but he'll take the hint. I doubt he'll do it to you again. Good luck. NTA.", "Agreed, if only his lack of pregnancy empathy extended to not leaving his dishes in the sink.", "People commenting ESH are probably men lol thank you for empathizing", "I mean\u2026 no one came to his defense \ud83d\ude02", "Yes, it sounds like the coworker is socially awkward and didn't know OP had this building hatred of him over a long time period.\n\nOn the other hand, his crying to HR that being called out on his grossness creates a \"hostile working environment\" is childish and it's disappointing HR just took his side 100%.\n\nNone of this is how well-functioning adults should behave at work.", "no, her pregnancy isn't anyone's problem but just because you would've laughed doesn't mean it's not disgusting or immature, it just means your humor is also disgusting and immature lol. I'm not pregnant or hormonal and I would not have laughed. You're just as bad as this guy invalidating her opinions just because she's pregnant. ridiculous \ud83d\ude02 and for the record, I think she should have handled it better but she doesn't deserve to have her feelings dismissed for being pregnant.", "This was my thought.  If he complains, tell him that you have pregnancy issues and he's creating a hostile work environment by complaining about it.", "I'm a woman who just had a baby last year and had to take prescription nausea meds throughout my first and second trimester... My vote is also ESH.\n\nI truly empathize and I completely agree with how you felt about it. I would feel the exact same way. That's disgusting, he's disgusting, who tf does that? The problem is solely how you handled it. You are at work and unfortunately you can't just say whatever you want at work, regardless of how true it is, and especially in front of other people. It's just not appropriate. You should have spoken to him in private or gone to your manager/HR yourself to make a complaint and let them address it if not comfortable talking to him yourself. Telling you that you're just moody because you're pregnant is also wildly inappropriate and offensive, and again, he is definitely disgusting, so ESH.\n\nbut also don't come here just to look for validation if you're going to invalidate anyone's opinion who thinks you weren't 100% right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\noh and congrats on the baby, hope everything goes well with the little one and work", "Womp, that comment alone makes it an automatic YTA toward the post, simply because it\u2019s now clear this post is fishing for karma and praise from internet strangers. Don\u2019t come on AITA if you\u2019re going to criticize the people that YOU came to for judgment", "Wow.", "Yeah I have a 2mo. It wasn\u2019t that long ago I was where you are and eff that, once first trimester was over I generally loved being pregnant but 1st trimester and that nausea was absolute hell. I barely ate, I suffered through every smell. One time my husband made a rib eye for lunch and I had been asleep and woke up to the smell permeating the apartment and it was\u2026 a really bad time. Every moment of being alive during that time was a bad time, I used to go lie in bed and put myself in what I called my \u201ctrans like state\u201d and try to dissociate. It is awful! But I hope you have a great rest of your pregnancy and beautiful baby!!! It will most likely be over soon and second trimester is usually the magic time!", "Stop with the sexism, it's disgusting, and do some research. I've struggled with acid reflux before and if his acid reflux is bad enough he'll burp either if he wants to or not.", "Woman here: ESH you could have told him differently and earlier and in private, but you decided to explode and berate him in front of everyone with the worst choices of words. \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy.", "[removed]"]}
