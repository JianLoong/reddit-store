We're taking a train trip and then renting a car to visit some towns near our \"main\" destination.\n\nThey said it sounded like a great idea, and my stepdad took it upon himself to look up train tickets and hotel rooms (he has hotel points from work travel).\n\nI told them to please let me know ASAP what my share of the hotel and train tickets would be, as I needed to make sure to set aside the money. It was already going to be tight for me, as I am paying off some debt, but I could make it work, and this will be a kinda once in a lifetime trip for someone like me.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I keep asking one or the other of them to let me know what my share will be. They keep saying \"oh, we'll let you know, thanks for reminding me\".\n\nFinally, *last week*, my stepdad lets me know the train ticket is $109. Awesome, I send him the money.\n\nThis week, I still haven't been told what my share of the hotel and rental car will be. I figured it wouldn't be too much since my stepdad (who has already booked the room) said he got 2 nights free, and we only needed 3 nights total. (Leave Thurs morning, take overnight train back Sunday night).\n\nFinally, today, I am told the following:\n\n* The hotel is $300/night, since it is in [MAJOR METRO DOWNTOWN].\n* We booked 4 nights not 3, since the overnight train Sunday night wasn't available after all.\n* So your share is $225 for the hotel. We still don't know about the car lol.\n\nNow, with 5 min of google searching, I found 2 different hotels from my stepdad's points brand that are both >$100/night cheaper, and closer to some of our destinations. Additionally, I had planned my leave request for work under the impression we were getting home Monday morning, so I would have all day Monday to do things like do laundry and clean my apartment before work on Tuesday. Instead we are getting back Monday evening, leaving me roughly 4 hours to get this stuff done. Oh, and my apartment has exactly 1 washer and 1 dryer in the building, so hopefully I don't get stuck behind someone else.\n\nI expressed frustration at not being more involved in the trip, which I came up with, and at not being given more info about the cost and about changes to the itinerary. I said you all knew my money is tight, and I repeatedly asked you to get me the cost as soon as possible, and you kept blowing me off. I also pointed out that, unlike my mom who sets her own schedule for work, and my stepdad who has flexible telework, I work in healthcare and have to be in clinic first thing Tuesday, basically 12 hours after stepping off the train.\n\nMy mom just said \"this is stupid, and if you don't want to go you can just cancel, but I'm not talking about this, you're just being dramatic and should have saved more money\".\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695175436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16n9472/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_family_about_a_poorly/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They didn't convey the costs as quickly as they agreed to, so you're justified in sharing your disappointment. \n\nI think your conversation about your budget was too vague. \"I need to budget/save for the trip\" is not the same statement as \"I can only afford $X.\" \n\nThe trip was adequately planned.

Hence wanting to know so I could set aside money from 2 months rather than 1.", "I think they ended up running away with your idea, whether they meant to or not and now they're in so deep that they've lost sight of they've done. Your mom sounded really defensive and putting her guilt about it back onto you by blaming you for not saving enough money and accusing you of being dramatic. Geez. She has a partner to contribute to the costs but you don't. And who's paying for all the meals and entertainment??\n\nEDIT: See about changing your vacation request at work for another time. Then start saving up for another trip for you and a friend! You would end up being the 3rd wheel with your mom and stepdad and probably doing whatever they want to do, going to restaurants that they want to go to, et cetera.", "Why can't you just go yourself? Take an earlier/later train, stay at a different hotel.", "Never being asked doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t speak up for yourself. Especially when it means the difference between losing out on a fun trip because you can\u2019t afford it, or being financially irresponsible just to still go anyway.", "Ok, ESH, but more of this is on you. They should have been quicker about getting you the info.\n\nBut also\u2026if you had strict financial limitations the conversation should not have been \u2018let me know asap how much it costs\u2019 but \u2018I cannot spend more than X amount\u2019. You went along with them making the plans and didn\u2019t tell them you had a limit, then got mad when they made arrangements that were cheap enough for you. And frankly, $225 for three nights in a hotel is an INCREDIBLE deal, so I don\u2019t know what you were expecting to pay. Nothing stopped you from putting aside more than enough money for the trip.\n\nThey also can\u2019t help that the train you initially wanted wasn\u2019t available.", ">She has a partner to contribute to the costs but you don't. And who's paying for all the meals and entertainment??\n\nLol, yeah, also - the extra day out of town means an extra day to pay the guy who checks on/feeds my cats. Meanwhile my mom and stepdad have my youngest brother there to mind their pets (not to mention he lives there rent free despite being employed full time...)\n\nAnd we're each paying for our own food, and splitting the cost of the rental car (not been told what that is) and gas for the car.", "Well for one I've already paid them part of my share, and for another I already scheduled my time off work.

You're getting the short end of the proverbial stick, my friend!!\n\nReminds me of some old card playing saying, or was it a song? \n\" You gotta know when to hold'em, know when to fold 'em!\" I think there's a last part that says something about knowing when to walk away!!\n\nEDIT: If it makes you feel any better, something similar happened to me some years ago. I had planned a special anniversary party for my parents. After discussing it with my siblings, one of them just went behind my back, made all the arrangements and presented it to our parents like it was their idea. They even picked another place instead of what I had planned, took my parents there and back, acting like they were the big organizers and then took all the thanks for an evening well planned and executed.", "Can you take back the money, and then re-book at a later date so it can be what you first wanted it to be?", "The song you're thinking of is \"The Gambler\" by Kenny Rogers", "I can ask if they will give back the money.

Money was paid via PayPal.\n\nMy (bio) dad has offered to chip in, so I might still be able to afford to go depending on how much he can afford to lend me, but I'm just feeling super soured on the whole thing.", "NTA - no one expects to get treated this way by their family. You tried to get ahead of it by asking about your end ahead of time and they kept blowing you off. You should tell your Mom how disappointed you are and how you expected more from her, especially if it was supposed to be the two of you to begin with.
