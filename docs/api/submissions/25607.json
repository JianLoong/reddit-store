Don't play these games (and I'm not talking about truth or dare), just find a real partner. This is an assumption on my part, but this is how it usually goes in these scenarios, men that only look for a few characteristics in women (conventionally attractive, fit, or other physical features) will attract women that only want a few characteristics from men (give away lots of money, provide nice material possessions). It takes two to tango, so if you are attracting gfs who want to play \"truth or dare\" and ask for money on the dare, you may want to look inward.", "Run, run, run, run. Run, run , run awaaaaaaaaay.
