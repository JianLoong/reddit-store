I\u2019m also an artist & I do similar work in your medium, I\u2019ve had luck sidestepping the controversy by adding the descriptors collage & mixed media when describing my art. Generally people understand that collage art is still art, it\u2019s just art where the artist is intentionally borrowing or referencing other visual media to tell a curated story.\n\nNTA in my personal opinion. But there may be ways to highlight and exemplify the handmade touches to your artwork that someone who\u2019s only ever seen photoshop used to make Kim K\u2019s but bigger, may not instinctly understand", "NTA they are clearly insecure even though it's not a competition. They are bullies plain and simple. They don't care about the purity of the art or whatever stupid bs they might use to justify themselves. Why do they care so much about how you want to do art?\n\nAnd here's the thing, I would consider myself elitist in some ways. I would definitely value your art lower than something more \"handmade.\" However, that doesn't mean that I would ever tell you this to your face unless I had a really good reason (such as right now explaining myself.) I would never try to make you feel bad about doing what you enjoy doing. I would never exclude you from anything art related when you clearly care and put in effort. So they clearly have issues.", "NTA - You were just defending your preferred method of art. There's no reason why that shouldn't be allowed.", "Nta you wouldn\u2019t be in the program if your artistic style wasn\u2019t allowed", "NTA", "NTA imo, they're art snobs. i do digital art using a graphics tablet and i think people who can DO ART on *photoshop* of all places are admirable. and if what you did wasn't art, you wouldn't be admitted into the school in the first place.", "NTA they sound like art snobs, insecure about your talent", "ESH, it really depends on how you defended your medium.  There is healthy debate and then there is yelling and screaming and badgering, I'm not sure which situation applies here.\n\nIf you feel you have been unfairly banned from the club take it up with the school, clubs are supposed to provide fair access to anyone that wants to join and participate. If there were no rules posted or provided regarding submissions they couldn't have rejected what you presented.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So, fans of a film series and offshoots that significantly influenced the development of computer generated imagery and effects have a problem with someone using digital illustration and tools as a medium? Yeah, okay.", "NTA, seriously wtf is this? It's not \"real art\" because you used Photoshop? Is it a technological thing, i.e., only canvas, statues, other real world objects can be art? \n\nThey sound snobby, and full of shit. Hopefully you can find some others in this school to be able to express yourself and challenge your skills. Sounds like you are already passionate so you should be fine as long as you believe in yourself.", "Art is often controversial. Not everyone agrees and that is fine.\n\nI just googled bosslogic - never heard of them prior - that's not my definition of \"art\". It's certainly creative and requires talent but I probably wouldn't call it art. However, that's just my opinion which given this bosslogic seems to have a decent size following many ppl clearly wouldn't agree with me.\n\nI think the sticking point that you probably had with the club is that if they don't consider your work \"art\" then they don't need a rule specifically excluding it because they don't think it fits within their clubs scope and therefore is auto excluded. The real issue is, is if you are an A H for defending your art and I think that depends on what you said in the arts defence. Art is subjective, what is \"art\" vs what is talented and creative is different for everyone, so as long as you were polite and respectful in defence of your work the NTA."]}
