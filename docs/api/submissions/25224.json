{"id": 25224, "submission_id": "15xrud8", "title": "AITA if I move out because my roommate was doing it with the door open?", "selftext": "I (27F) live with a longtime friend (27M) since the beginning of this year. I think its been a transition for him, he has primarily lived in the military and our friendship was mostly over the phone while he was deployed. We have been there for each other, I got him through a very tough breakup and he has been someone to talk to whenever I was having a bad moment. Since I moved here I encouraged him to enroll in college and have been helping him with his homework and studying before every exam, I did a class for him he was struggling with, and because I don't have a car he drives me places when I request it. I prevented him from delving back into alcoholism, I take care of his dog when he is gone to school or work. That is to say, up till now we have been good friends and generally good roommates.\n\nThe issue happened last night, he brought a girl over for the first time here and I was ok with it. I mostly stayed in my room and went to sleep early. I woke up in the middle of the night to the sounds of their love making, I am talking LOUD noises. My room is 10 feet away from his room in the hallway, and I saw he left his door wide fucking open, that no wonder it woke me up. I was disgusted. They both knew I was here, why wouldn't they close the door??? I texted him about how disrespectful and disturbing it was that they left the door open when we live in a tiny apartment. In the morning, I was still annoyed but when I came out he was trying to make smalltalk with me like nothing happened. I turned around and asked him to apologize, but he just zoned out for 30 seconds and said \"sorry\". I left to go have lunch with a friend who I talked to and agreed that it was really disrespectful and gross of him and he should apologize. I asked a few friends who also agreed with me so I knew I wasn't making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nWhen I came home and again asked him if he had something to apologize for, he said he didn't. We got into an argument where his stance was I should have just came over to say something instead of texting, that it wasn't a big deal, and the fact that I was angry over this was stupid since he didn't notice the door was open. My stance is that it is both disrespectful, rude and disgusting that I was unwillingly subjected to his love life, and that I shouldn't have to drag an apology out of him. The argument got heated and he told me to \"shut up\" multiple times and leave our living room multiple times, and he said some personally attacking things. I feel like I lost a friend and that I cannot live with someone who cannot even apologize over something that should be a standard. I am planning on moving out and finding a place of my own, leaving him to deal with footing the bill of our apartment or find a roommate. I just can't deal with living with someone so blatantly disrespectful to me.

It\u2019s almost like he wanted you to see? I know a lot of people have fetishes for stuff like that, which is totally not okay because you didn\u2019t consent to see that.\n\nYou need to sit him down and have a serious talk with him. This isn\u2019t okay. Don\u2019t let him brush it off. There\u2019s absolutely no way he didn\u2019t know what he was doing.", "NTA - This friendship has run it\u2019s course. Move out, it\u2019s only going to get worse & be more uncomfortable. Don\u2019t live like that.", "NTA. If he wants to fuck freely roommates are not the way to go - signed a person that pays way too much to do just that", "NTA. \n\nSuper disrespectful on his part. \n\nAnd his unwillingness to even consider apologizing is definitely grounds for you to reconsider living with him. \n\nI\u2019d give it one more chance at a potential conversation to talk through everything with him, but I wouldn\u2019t be that optimistic about him changing his perspective. \n\nI hope everything works out for you.", "I don\u2019t like the vibe I got from him during your argument. Honestly who the fuck tells someone they consider an equal to go to their room? That was really weird, maybe he couldn\u2019t think of a good enough retort or insult? Idk, but it could be he felt embarrassed or something and got defensive instead of apologetic. Especially if he has sorta feelings for you and is upset his plan to entice you didn\u2019t work out? Because lol who says go to your room like he\u2019s your dad? Wtf. \nAlso the fact he then made it personal, and said offensive things without you having gone over that line, yes- that is super disrespectful from a friend and roommate. You wanting an apology from someone not willing to give it, well yeah. It can be a friendship ended. Definitely roommate ender. \nI think you should make plans on moving out, once you have a good idea on the time/$, have a talk and tell him that you\u2019re planning on leaving by so and so date. That you don\u2019t think living as roommates work if you can\u2019t respect the others boundaries. That he\u2019s your friend and it hurts your feelings that when you tell him something that he\u2019s done in your shared home bothered you , he didn\u2019t care. Then proceeded to insult you, which is not a friend move. Listen you made that shit clear to him on various occasions you\u2019re not interested in him that way, so him having sex basically in the open is not ok). You\u2019re request for privacy in your home should be a solid / do not fucking cross type of line.\nIf he continues to act out as the aggressor than you shouldn\u2019t remain friends either. Don\u2019t put up with shit you wouldn\u2019t let even a stranger do to you.  Good luck", "Yeah, that\u2019s crazy asf and it\u2019s honestly just weird tbh, like why would he leave the door open and why is he being so difficult about giving an apology. Also, for him to use personal info against you is way outta line and THATS something he should apologize to you for. With that being said, and I\u2019m prolly gonna get downvoted into oblivion for this, but I think you\u2019re both dragging it out. You seem hell bent on getting an apology, despite him already giving you an apology, even if it was a bs one. Also, he might just be embarrassed cause you overheard/saw him have sex with a girl; this isn\u2019t a valid excuse, I just want you to try and see it from his perspective. Also, from my POV, it feels like you may like him more as a friend, simply based on the way you write about him. Idk, all of this is just my gatherings from your post, but either way, I think y\u2019all should try to maybe see if y\u2019all could come to a common ground and work around this. I mean, it just sounds like you really care about him and it\u2019s doesn\u2019t make any sense for either of you to throw away a perfectly good friendship over something that\u2019s kinda petty in the grand scheme of things.", "NTA.

It\u2019s a bit of an annoyance but is it the end of the world? This really seems like something friends who live together would laugh about rather than going from zero to moving out over one rando noisy boom boom sesh.", "NTA.\n\nObviously what he did was gross and inconsiderate, and he absolutely should apologise for it. That all being said, I do think you're over-reacting a bit. It sounds like you two have a good relationship and have been through a lot together, are you sure you want to walk away from all that over a disagree on privacy? I get the main issue is he refuses to apologise, and that's a red flag for anyone, but I'd simply suggest you try to talk (not yell) to try and get him to see reason. Maybe there's something going on in the background he hasn't talked about, I don't know.\n\nYou're right to be upset, and you're NTA here, but it would be a shame to lose a close friend over a room-mate's spat.", "Nta\n\nDisgusting", "Soft NTA, but there are issues here\n\nYour entire first paragraph is everything you've done for him with him... giving you rides? \n\nHad he done anything for you over the course of this friendship?\n\nAlso you seem overly mad about this\n\nYes it's gross he had the door open but is it possible he was drunk?  If he says he won't do it again then it's fine.\n\n  At 27 you have to have had roommates that have had sex before? This can't be your first rodeo with this.  Headphones, close YOUR door. The end\n\nAlso i know you say you don't have romantic feelings for him and you've shut him down on that front.  Is it possible a part of you is mad that he has actually moved on from you?  Like he was your backup plan or something? \n\nAnyway, yes, he was wrong, but it seems like you're overreacting quite a bit. If there's truly no romance here, then  this isn't worth moving out and ending a friendship\n\nSeriously.  Headphones.  Your door closed.  If he comes and opens your door and makes you watch then call the cops but i don't think that'll happen", "It was probably an exhibition kink.\n\nYou didn\u2019t consent to be part of his kink.  Gross.\n\nI guess that living situation is over.\n\nNTA", "NTA. A sincere apology isn\u2019t going to kill him. It\u2019s bloody weird that this the hill he\u2019s willing to die on.", "Well, unless you thought he would be sleeping with you, it wasn't a big deal. If they didn't do it on purpose. It's not like they were having sex on your couch or something. Why are you in a tiff about this. I mean, really. I would examine why you are so upset about it. People have sex you understand that if you don't like it, don't look. You obviously don't mind living like one of the bros with your male friend. Right, you believe the sexes are equal he treated you like a bro. You let him down. You should have busted the door open shouted, \"she came too loud\" slapped him on the ass to let him know good game. Then wink at home girl as you close the \" bite the pillow baby girl bro got stamina for days\" close the door and go back to bed. High fived him at breakfast, smelled your finger smile, and said nice. That is friendship, right there. Real friend shit. \n\nJoke\n\nI mean, who cares if their friend gets laid. If you want to be a friend with guys, we are gross. Sounds more like you are the chic he didn't put the moves on and wants away out the friends zone. Even if they did it on purpose, you knew they were having sex and you looked into the room creeper.", "Going against the current here. I get that is was a bit disrespectful and that he should have been more considerate but he probably got carried away with this girl and forgot to close the door! Now if this was a common thing, I\u2019d totally side with you but I think you\u2019re being a bit over dramatic here. He\u2019s your friend, and yes he screwed up, but you made suuuch a big deal out it when it happened one time. I\u2019m a woman myself and even though I don\u2019t need to see my guy friend bang his flavour of the month I sure as hell don\u2019t break up a friendship over it! \n\nCalm down and discuss the situation with him once the dust has settled and work out what can be done better in the future. Maybe he can try and go over to his lady friends house or hang a sock on his door when he\u2019s having a lady over so you know what\u2019s up \ud83d\ude09", "So, sounds to me like he left it open on purpose so you\u2019d realize what you\u2019re \u201cmissing out\u201d on. I mean, the woman was in the throes of passion with him! He probably thought you\u2019d be tempted and in calling him out for disrespecting your right not to have to listen to his sex life on surround sound he probably felt frustrated/rejected, hence the lack of apology.", "NAH.\nSo when are you going to talk to him about your feelings for him ?", "Esh do what the contract say", "I think you caught feelings", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He may have learned it from a parent who never apologised. These people just get defensive and turn it around on you.

Not saying those are valid initial responses, just limiting in finding any sort of resolution.", "Fair points. Obviously you've tried talking about this and he just doesn't seem interested in admitting his mistake. My advice wasn't so much to talk again, it was more to ask yourself if the way your talking may be part of it; to approach the discussion a different way. Sometimes when I argue with my partner, a large part of it is the yelling/aggression/stand-off-ish attitude we both bring, rather than the issue itself.

Why is he acting like he\u2019s your parent??? This whole situation is beyond crazy. At this point you should look to move out, or have him move out. This isn\u2019t okay. Nobody should speak to you like that.\n\nHe KNOWS it was fcking weird with how defensive he got about it.", "Then NTA move out and cut contact asap", "Oof that\u2019s such a long time. I bet you can find someone to take over for you. You definitely don\u2019t deserve to live in that environment for so long.", "Uhm\u2026 asking someone if they are going to apologise isn\u2019t a neutral way of engaging. It is obvious that you are upset by this - and I dont want to negate the way you are feeling - but anger is an odd choice for what doesn\u2019t seem to be a pattern of behaviour.", "No problem. Thank you for the correct O.P. my bad. I wish you the best of luck.", "Well if this is the only thing it doesn't seem worth going nuclear\n\nThis stuff happens with roommates\n\nBut if this is a last straw or something?\n\nAlso only you know if you can live with this. This seems pretty minor and you're old enough to deal with it", "I told him it was my apartment too so I wouldn't be doing that, and he got angry and we ended up yelling at each other. It is weird, I am tired of being treated so disrespectfully by men in my life, including him. I know I have to move out but I wonder if the right thing is to find someone to take over my lease before I do?", "That\u2019s the bit that I would move out over - assuming for a minute that he and the girl did genuinely forget to close the door, the appropriate response to your raising it is to apologise and not do it again. After everything else you\u2019ve done for him, he doesn\u2019t have the right to talk to you like that.", "Preferably a guy", "Yeah, I'd agree. OP definitely took a passive-aggressive approach to the issue the morning after. Also, he did apologise, but looks like he didn't see it as as big a deal as OP did. Then, when OP brought it up again, he got defensive.\n\nOne incident does not make a pattern, so all these people saying he did it deliberately as some kind of weird fetish or flex need to chill. It is more than possible  for two people who meet up on a night out, probably after several drinks, to lose track of something like shutting a door.\n\nThis doesn't mean OP is out of line for being upset about it, but it does also sound like both OP and flatmate could use some healthier communication about their situation.", "I\u2019m not sure about the logistics because I\u2019ve never been in an apartment before. (Only lived at home and then moving into a dorm) \n\nBut yeah him acting all defensive and yelling at you is actually insane. He knows he did wrong and he knows it was on purpose. If it were a genuine accident (but like how would that even be an accident), he wouldn\u2019t respond this way.", "You don't do that to your roommates especially in a situation where you're clearly in the wrong (he's in the wrong).  You tried to handle it and he disrespected the autonomy and authority you have as a roommate.  I would move out based on this interaction itself, the public sex is secondary.", "Maybe you can speak to the landlord and see if they will let you out of the lease with little to no financial repercussions. His expedition was disgusting, but yelling and ordering you to your room is abusive. Let your landlord know that you are uncomfortable and /or feeling unsafe. You can find a better \"friend.\" Can you afford to live on your own?"]}
