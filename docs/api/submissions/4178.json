I (37F), single at the time, made plans to travel with my best friend (36F) (also invited) and her husband and 5 year old daughter. My sister (35 F), engaged to a stain of a woman, made plans to go with her fianc\u00e9. Fianc\u00e9 bails at the last minute and my sister wants me to change all of my travel plans to include her. I had plans to arrive early and travel around France with my friend and her family.

She says she doesn\u2019t care and will sleep on the floor. So, I decide to talk it over with my friend even though I don\u2019t really want to change my plans, but I feel guilty because her fianc\u00e9 left her in the lurch.  We agree that due to personality differences and lack of sleeping arrangements that we won\u2019t be having her come with us. \n\nSister flips out. Says she can\u2019t believe I wouldn\u2019t include her or change my plans. She then asked me to cancel my plans entirely and hang out with her instead.  I said no and went about my original plans.\n\nThis happened 4 years ago but has recently come up again when making plans for the holidays. I don\u2019t really think I\u2019m the asshole and think she was unreasonable- she could\u2019ve invited a friend, traveled with my mom and grandmother, etc. She had other options, she just didn\u2019t want those options.
