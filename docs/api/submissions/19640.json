{"id": 19640, "submission_id": "149a3k6", "title": "AITA for defending my hobby to my girlfriend?", "selftext": "Everyone has their little hobby that they enjoy doing when they have a little free time or when trying to unwind after a long day at work. Mine just so happens to be gaming. It\u2019s not excessive as I only play for a few hours each night when I\u2019m unwinding after working all day. My girlfriend (22 F) is not the biggest fan of games as her past partners proved that they were putting games over the relationship. We\u2019ve had plenty of conversations about it and I understand that she\u2019s had difficulty with games in the past so I try not to overdo it. I make sure I sit down and talk with her and make sure everything is good before I sit down for the night before coming to bed. A couple of examples is, I run our laundry, I clean up our room, and I make sure everything is cleaned up and ready so that she never has to worry about anything. I try and remember to do everything she asks as I have borderline ADHD and will sometimes zone out and forget that she asked me to do something. Fast forward to a couple of nights ago, same night as usual but before she went to go shower, she had asked me to put some drinks in the fridge so she had something to drink before bed. I was on the games at that point and was completely zoned out and didn\u2019t hear her tell me. She comes back out and quiet so naturally picking up on this I asked her if everything was ok and she tells me she\u2019s fine. Which obviously means I\u2019ve done something to make her upset. She then proceeds to tell me that I prioritize games over and thats she\u2019s done with it. Me being super confused as to how I\u2019ve been prioritizing it over our relationship, asked how I\u2019ve done that. She then says that I ignore her and that I\u2019m addicted to video games. I then start to defend my position on it as games to me is a hobby and something that I enjoy doing after working all day. I do a fairly good job at buying flowers and making sure she knows that I love her. I\u2019m not the best at that because of my past relationships but I\u2019ve been working on it as I know it\u2019s important to her. Fast forward a little more, she\u2019s now super pissed at me and won\u2019t talk to me.

A few hours a night is actually a lot for someone who lives with a non gaming partner. Do you do anything together after dinner/chores?

If this post were from her perspective, I\u2019d advise her to move out. You spend your evenings with your hobby and she doesn\u2019t enjoy it. She deserves to find someone that enjoys the same things she does. You deserve the same.", "I'm giving you a soft YTA. You think a few hours every night parked in front of your game system, completely zoning her out is healthy for a relationship? And btw, it's not a hobby when it consumes all your free time, it is an obsession. She's obviously feeling neglected, and throwing flowers and kisses in the air at her every now and again isn't going to cut it. Unless you're willing to cut back your gaming time drastically and spend more time doing things you both like together, then I think you better break things off and find someone who shares your gaming passion as much as you do.", "NTA. You are allowed your hobbies. Frankly, if your girlfriend has issues with dating gamers, she shouldn\u2019t be dating a gamer.", "NAH - but you both picked wrong.\n\nShe mustn\u2019t date people who game. And you must stop dating people who don\u2019t like your clearly harmless hobbies.", "NAH\n\nA few hours daily is excessive.  But you like gaming and have checklisted your relationship must-dos.  Some women may find this to be enough.  Your woman, however, does not.  She'll probably leave you if you don't change your ways.\n\nSo it's up to you, are the video games more important than her?  The answer to the question may provide you insight into whether you are or are not addicted to gaming.", "Jesus dude, stop kissing her ass and pandering to her, this is painful to read", "NTA.\n\nBut please, my brother, leave that girl. It's never going to get better and she's going to beat you down until you just give up on your hobbies. I've seen this EXACT same scenario happen over and over and over. Get out while you can.", "INFO: what do you mean you have borderline ADHD? Have you been diagnosed with ADHD?", "ESH.  A few hours a night is a lot, not a little time for a hobby.  \n\nBy your description she is right, you are prioritizing gaming if you do your \"chores\" then rush off to do something only you can enjoy instead of suggesting things to do together some nights, or doing something that moves you forward on your life path.  If this is your major free time investment, you might have an addiction.  If you can't stand the thought of not doing it for a few nights or a week, you might have an addiction. \n\nShe is being passive aggressive in her approach by saying \"fine\".  In the time it took her to ask you to put drinks in the fridge she could have done it herself.", "NTA", "Depends on the night. There\u2019s maybe one night a week where I\u2019m working till 7-8pm. I come home do laundry and won\u2019t be sitting down for the night until almost 10. I make sure to plan dates almost every weekend along with dinner dates during the week whenever I\u2019m home early enough.", "The Switch is a godsend lol She watches her shows, I sit next to her and play Switch. I'm getting my video game fix while still spending time with her", "This right here is the single worst response on the entire thread. Good job.", "Honestly, my first thought was that if she's had several partners with one thing she takes issue with, she's the common denominator.", "Exactly! I agree with this statement. My boyfriend and I are gamers and we always play our video games to wind ourselves down after a long day at work and we also spend time together when we\u2019re not playing our games whether it\u2019s going on fun dates or skateboarding on the bike path. Everyone has hobbies that they enjoy doing. OP is NTA he should reconsider this relationship.", "You are allowed your hobby, if it's something you do a couple of times a week, not a few hours every single night. Given that most people work and need to sleep, something that takes up hours of every day can very well become an issue, if you aren't pulling your weight in the household and sacrificing quality time with your partner. That being said, yes, this girl shouldn't date a gamer.", "A few hours daily is not excessive.", "But then how many hours are you gaming? It seems like you come home, do basic things around the house like laundry (which is not quality time with your gf by the way) and then play video games and ignore your gf for the rest of the night. \n\nThe issue here is the disparity in quality time (not time spent doing household chores) and gaming. You should be spending as much time with your gf as you do gaming, if not more. Also, you should never be so \u201cin the zone\u201d that you 100% tune out your girlfriend. That\u2019s so rude.", "Ok, so how many hours do you play video games during the week vs spend time with her?  Playing video games in the same house is not the same as spending time together.", "That doesn't really answer the question. What does it look like day to day? You said couple of hours. Is it 1-3 or 4-6? And also doing chores is cool but do you spend any time together? It seems to me like you just do the chores only to have that as an excuse to go to your games. Yeah ok you didn't hear her when she asked you about the drinks. Probably wasn't the first time that happened.", "Agreed. Me and my partner share the hobby and enjoying doing it together. If one of us is doing something on a game that's important we respect that, and i cant imagine what it would be like simply trying to unwind but being looked down upon for it. I mean, if the hobby was ANYTHING else, reading, gardening, anything, would it be looked down upon? I think gaming has a negative label sadly. Dating another gamer is totally the way to go.", "She seems to think it is.  \n\nI struggled with gaming addiction before.  When you have to do something, for hours, everyday, to the detriment of your personal relationships, it is an addiction.\n\nOP needs to find another hobby to do with his partner, or he will lose her.", "OP already said that he regularly makes plans for quality time with his GF ever weekend and various nights during the week when possible, which is as much quality time as MOST couples get. He's ABSOLUTELY allowed to spend some of his limited free time on his own hobbies, which for him, is gaming. His gf is clearly taking out her own issues on him. If she doesn't want a bf that games, then that's her prerogative, but based on the information provided - he's not doing anything wrong. They're just in the wrong relationship.", "1-2 hours. I make sure to ask if it\u2019s ok before I play because she likes to watch Netflix and stuff. If she\u2019s says no I don\u2019t play."]}
