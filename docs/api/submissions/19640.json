Mine just so happens to be gaming. It\u2019s not excessive as I only play for a 1-2 hours in about 3 days a week when I\u2019m unwinding after working all day. My girlfriend (22 F) is not the biggest fan of games as her past partners proved that they were putting games over the relationship. We\u2019ve had plenty of conversations about it and I understand that she\u2019s had difficulty with games in the past so I try not to overdo it. I make sure I sit down and talk with her and make sure everything is good before I sit down for the night before coming to bed. A couple of examples is, I run our laundry, I clean up our room, and I make sure everything is cleaned up and ready so that she never has to worry about anything. I try and remember to do everything she asks as I have borderline ADHD and will sometimes zone out and forget that she asked me to do something. Fast forward to a couple of nights ago, same night as usual but before she went to go shower, she had asked me to put some drinks in the fridge so she had something to drink before bed. I was on the games at that point and was completely zoned out and didn\u2019t hear her tell me. She comes back out and quiet so naturally picking up on this I asked her if everything was ok and she tells me she\u2019s fine. Which obviously means I\u2019ve done something to make her upset. She then proceeds to tell me that I prioritize games over and thats she\u2019s done with it. Me being super confused as to how I\u2019ve been prioritizing it over our relationship, asked how I\u2019ve done that. She then says that I ignore her and that I\u2019m addicted to video games. I then start to defend my position on it as games to me is a hobby and something that I enjoy doing after working all day. I do a fairly good job at buying flowers and making sure she knows that I love her. I\u2019m not the best at that because of my past relationships but I\u2019ve been working on it as I know it\u2019s important to her. Fast forward a little more, she\u2019s now super pissed at me and won\u2019t talk to me. Any thoughts?\n\n\n**Disclaimer**\nI do all the household chores, make sure the dog is fed, clean our closet and all her shoes since she leaves them laying everywhere, make sure everything she asks of me is done, and everything is done before I even think about sitting down to relax.

She deserves to find someone that enjoys the same things she does. You deserve the same.", "I'm giving you a soft YTA. You think a few hours every night parked in front of your game system, completely zoning her out is healthy for a relationship? And btw, it's not a hobby when it consumes all your free time, it is an obsession. She's obviously feeling neglected, and throwing flowers and kisses in the air at her every now and again isn't going to cut it. Unless you're willing to cut back your gaming time drastically and spend more time doing things you both like together, then I think you better break things off and find someone who shares your gaming passion as much as you do.", "NTA. You are allowed your hobbies. Frankly, if your girlfriend has issues with dating gamers, she shouldn\u2019t be dating a gamer.", "NAH - but you both picked wrong.\n\nShe mustn\u2019t date people who game. And you must stop dating people who don\u2019t like your clearly harmless hobbies.", "NAH\n\nA few hours daily is excessive.  But you like gaming and have checklisted your relationship must-dos.

The answer to the question may provide you insight into whether you are or are not addicted to gaming.", "Jesus dude, stop kissing her ass and pandering to her, this is painful to read", "NTA.\n\nBut please, my brother, leave that girl. It's never going to get better and she's going to beat you down until you just give up on your hobbies. I've seen this EXACT same scenario happen over and over and over. Get out while you can.", "INFO: what do you mean you have borderline ADHD? Have you been diagnosed with ADHD?", "ESH.  A few hours a night is a lot, not a little time for a hobby.  \n\nBy your description she is right, you are prioritizing gaming if you do your \"chores\" then rush off to do something only you can enjoy instead of suggesting things to do together some nights, or doing something that moves you forward on your life path.  If this is your major free time investment, you might have an addiction.  If you can't stand the thought of not doing it for a few nights or a week, you might have an addiction. \n\nShe is being passive aggressive in her approach by saying \"fine\".  In the time it took her to ask you to put drinks in the fridge she could have done it herself.", "NTA", "Depends on the night. There\u2019s maybe one night a week where I\u2019m working till 7-8pm.

I make sure to plan dates almost every weekend along with dinner dates during the week whenever I\u2019m home early enough.", "The Switch is a godsend lol She watches her shows, I sit next to her and play Switch.

Good job.", "Honestly, my first thought was that if she's had several partners with one thing she takes issue with, she's the common denominator.", "Exactly! I agree with this statement. My boyfriend and I are gamers and we always play our video games to wind ourselves down after a long day at work and we also spend time together when we\u2019re not playing our games whether it\u2019s going on fun dates or skateboarding on the bike path. Everyone has hobbies that they enjoy doing. OP is NTA he should reconsider this relationship.", "You are allowed your hobby, if it's something you do a couple of times a week, not a few hours every single night. Given that most people work and need to sleep, something that takes up hours of every day can very well become an issue, if you aren't pulling your weight in the household and sacrificing quality time with your partner. That being said, yes, this girl shouldn't date a gamer.", "A few hours daily is not excessive.", "But then how many hours are you gaming? It seems like you come home, do basic things around the house like laundry (which is not quality time with your gf by the way) and then play video games and ignore your gf for the rest of the night. \n\nThe issue here is the disparity in quality time (not time spent doing household chores) and gaming. You should be spending as much time with your gf as you do gaming, if not more. Also, you should never be so \u201cin the zone\u201d that you 100% tune out your girlfriend. That\u2019s so rude.", "Ok, so how many hours do you play video games during the week vs spend time with her?  Playing video games in the same house is not the same as spending time together.", "That doesn't really answer the question. What does it look like day to day? You said couple of hours. Is it 1-3 or 4-6? And also doing chores is cool but do you spend any time together? It seems to me like you just do the chores only to have that as an excuse to go to your games. Yeah ok you didn't hear her when she asked you about the drinks. Probably wasn't the first time that happened.", "Agreed. Me and my partner share the hobby and enjoying doing it together. If one of us is doing something on a game that's important we respect that, and i cant imagine what it would be like simply trying to unwind but being looked down upon for it. I mean, if the hobby was ANYTHING else, reading, gardening, anything, would it be looked down upon? I think gaming has a negative label sadly. Dating another gamer is totally the way to go.", "She seems to think it is.  \n\nI struggled with gaming addiction before.  When you have to do something, for hours, everyday, to the detriment of your personal relationships, it is an addiction.\n\nOP needs to find another hobby to do with his partner, or he will lose her.", "OP already said that he regularly makes plans for quality time with his GF ever weekend and various nights during the week when possible, which is as much quality time as MOST couples get. He's ABSOLUTELY allowed to spend some of his limited free time on his own hobbies, which for him, is gaming. His gf is clearly taking out her own issues on him. If she doesn't want a bf that games, then that's her prerogative, but based on the information provided - he's not doing anything wrong. They're just in the wrong relationship.", "1-2 hours. I make sure to ask if it\u2019s ok before I play because she likes to watch Netflix and stuff. If she\u2019s says no I don\u2019t play.", "Edit: I read below it's 1-2 hours of gaming, that's a very short time.  \nNTA\n\n\nINFO:  \nHow many is a few hours? There isn't that much time left after a work day and there's a big difference between 2 hours and 6. You talk about a lot of 'performative' actions like chores and flowers but what about quality time?  \nRight now it's hard to determine whether she's reacting this way because she's afraid of the past repeating itself or because the past is already repeating itself.", "I would say NTA. You are allowed to enjoy your own hobbies. I hope the best for you two!", "This subreddit needs more time being blacked out. I can't with these comments today.", "NTA\n\nThink about it this way. Your gf has had several partners who all seem to have the exact same problem. At some point, you have to wonder if she's the common denominator. You shouldn't have to feel guilty for engaging in a hobby every once in a while, nor should you have to ask permission. Cutting your SO off from something they enjoy in moderation is a red flag. Don't ignore it.", "\"playing videogames is childish, you need to find a better hobby\" - my ex \\*while watching tok ticks on her phone for hours straight.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA - Sometimes you just can't win.", "NTA I really think you should edit your post to include all the things you said in the comments. The fact that you do your chores, then ask her if she's okay with you playing beforehand is a very important detail. Also, playing a game for two hours a few times a week (not for hours on end every day like it sounds like in your post) is not the same as coming home and ignoring your girlfriend to game all the time. The people voting Y T A or E S H probably haven't read any of your comments.\n\nEDIT: after that disclaimer, WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE BRING TO THIS RELATIONSHIP!? You do all the household chores, work your ass off, and take care of the dog, on top of always being the one to plan dates etc. And on top of all that, she complains because you take a few hours a week to yourself. You really need to reevaluate this relationship, you're not her boyfriend, you're her live in nanny.", "NTA\n\nYou do not need to defend your hobby and you are not responsible for her past experiences.\n\nYour hobby could be anything, it\u2019s not about the hobby, it\u2019s about how prioritizing looks different to the two of you. \n\nIf gaming was such an issue for her, then it should have been a deal breaker at the start - not something that she holds you to the fire for.\n\nThe \u201cfine\u201d is not healthy communication, it\u2019s a trap. \nIf she\u2019s angry and not expressing it directly, you will walk on eggshells trying to figure out what you did wrong. (or land on Reddit)\n\nNot talking to you is also not healthy communication, it\u2019s the silent treatment. \n\nGetting clear on a diagnosis could help with your communication approach in the future, (and hopefully with someone that also games), but as far as this relationship goes - you have some things to decide.", "ESH- a few hours can very excessive, especially after a work day. It\u2019s also not fair of her to get mad at you for unwinding how you want to after work it seems like a lose-lose situation.\n\nIs she completely against gaming with you? There are lots of fun multiplayer games, like maybe you could play Mario Party or Mario Kart together. That way you are gaming whilst also spending time together. It shows her you want to include her in your hobbies.", "NTA. It sounds like your partner has issues with communicating her needs, addressing her own issues, and blaming you for not preparing every thing she wants EG the drinks she wanted you to prepare for her. Immediately going into you about how you are addicted to games sounds like a toxic move when she should have done the healthy thing and calmly communicated her needs. Gaming isn\u2019t a sin it\u2019s a hobby, no different than sewing, crossword puzzles, or photography. It\u2019s not your responsibility to coddle your girlfriend\u2019s toxicity when she\u2019s not even able to healthily communicate her own desires.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m reading your comments, and seeing that you ask permission to turn on your console and game?  This is not healthy. You should not have to ask permission to do a solo hobby. Would it be healthy if she wanted to spend a couple hours gardening per night and she couldn\u2019t do it without having permission granted?  She isn\u2019t your mother she\u2019s supposed to be a partner\u2026", "I get home at 5:00 and I want 8 hours of sleep. That gives me 4 hours.", "NTA.

You're incompatible and she sounds like she's abusing your honest efforts to work on the relationship.", "Seems he is treating gf like he would his mother and gf is unwillingly being thrust into that role. If you were my bf and came home to game every evening I would say it wouldn't be long before I lost interest in you entirely and went off to look for someone more suitable.", "I would say soft YTA. My fianc\u00e9 and I both enjoy gaming after a long day at work when we are too tired to go out. He likes a variety of games, I like one. If he spends hours playing, or I spend hours playing, we\u2019re not giving each other the attention and time each deserve. We compromise, we play together, taking turns, watching the other and hyping each other up. But we will cap it, at 30 minutes- hour. And we don\u2019t play every night, like two nights a week. So we aren\u2019t spending our whole night engrossed. We will have a show we watch together or take turns picking movies, or we will go for a walk or go do something together (like pickle ball for example). I get where you are coming from with the gaming. I am introverted and being at work all day socializing drains me. Sometimes I just need 30 minutes sitting playing a game to get recharged, and then I\u2019m good for the night. But even if I want to play video games for 4 hours, I don\u2019t. I put my relationship first, that\u2019s how it always should be. We communicate when we had an extra hard day, and what we can give to each other, and what our needs are.", "Nta but when you say all the chores do you mean all of your share or literally everything?", "ESH\n\nYou both need to communicate better. None of this immature silent treatment and \"I'm fine, its all good\" when clearly it isn't. Relationships are about compromise and communication and not letting resentment build up. you both need to step up and say what you need so that you both are on the same page.", "A few hours every night is a lot. Sounds like her current boyfriend prioritizes gaming above her too. YTA. You spend more time gaming than quality time with her.", "NTA.

You do 100% of the household chores which is unfair to you. You not replying when in a game is annoying, but easy to solve in a relationship with some communication. Playing a few hours of video games each night seems excessive, and I wouldn't want to be in a relationship like that. But again, that's not an AH move, just different ways to spend your time.\n\nSo, what exactly is the issue between the two of you? Can you pinpoint where you're the asshole, or she is? Is it about expectations, attention, division of labor, ..?\n\nEdit: clearly NTA since OP is the only one who does all of the household chores, brings in all of the income and spends 1-2 hours a night gaming (where does he find the time??).

She no good for you.", "I was that girlfriend. My boyfriend then started reintroducing me. I played as a child. When we fought; we would play mortal kombat and I became so good that I stopped losing. He found games we okay together and things we do separately. I love him for it, it\u2019s a good stay at home hobby. He does a majority of house work but I work 10 hours 5 days a week. He\u2019s very much my rock. I think you need to have a serious talk and explain to her that she can\u2019t expect a house made and unlimited time. You deserve 1-2 hours. She would hate mine. 4-6 hours a day, everyday we have nothing else to do. She needs to get it together", "NTA - She knows what she's getting into when she dates a gamer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe can date a non gamer. You can date a fellow gamer.

Neither is wrong. \n\n>I only play for a few hours each night \n\nThis seems like a HUGE amount of time to me, but then that's why I didn't date gamers.", "From my experience life is too short to let people make demands of your time.

You\u2019re in the middle of doing something and she asks you to do something that she can do before she decides to make herself busy by hopping in the shower? This seems entitled.

If you haven't been diagnosed, you shouldn't add to the stigma by applying it to your behavior.", "ESH\n\nYour girlfriend simply wants to enjoy all the enjoyable things if a relationship without the effort then gets mad at you when you want to relax. If she did some chores or helped plan something that would free up time on your end by not doing basic chores and spend time with her. \n\nOn the other hand you have to ask and lowkey guilt trip her into letting you spend ur time with your hobby.

She does not have to worry about doing any of it because she asks me to do it all.\n\nOk, so what does she do exactly? Because if you're working, and doing all the household chores, and looking after the dogs it begs the question what she's doing to occupy her time enough beyond maybe cooking, because I think someone who just leaves her shoes about and creates unnecessary work for others shouldn't be this persnickety about your hobby? Does she pay all the bills? Is this relationship equitable or is it just all about her with the gaming being the last holdout she hasn't eroded out of you.\n\nLike, I get it, she's had bad experiences. Hell, I'd say a not insignificant amount of women like your girlfriend have, hence the projection in the comments, but as you've said in other comments and the main OP you don't actually game every night, and you only play a couple of hours. Which, btw, a couple of hours is nothing for hobbies in general just ask the literary community how often they said, \"Another chapter.\" You also ask permission before doing. Your girlfriend also knows you have ADHD, which you are managing yes, but there are going to be slip ups and gaming isn't to blame for that when a zone out can occur for really any reason.\n\nIt sounds like your girlfriend is just always going to make your hobby about herself, and every little misstep will come down to it. That isn't on you, that's on her for needing to seek therapy before dating again.\n\nNTA and this relationship sounds like it's spiraling the drain, because she has issues.", "NTA my bf is a gamer.

As a wife of a guy who used to game a lot more than 6 hours a week for our first few years dating, you are not at all an asshole for defending your hobby. Honestly, your gf sounds like a super big asshole tho and if she can't compromise now, I'd end it. Relationships are all about compromise,  and if she can't bend on this, why would you just not move on? You are far too young to be stuck in a one-sided relationship!\n\nEnjoy your gaming lol", "\u201cYou do everything she asks \u201c aka she carries the mental load of running a household .

If he's not able to spend time with her because he's too busy with work and chores and 1-2 hours of gaming she is more than welcome to start helping out with some of the chores. He is entitled to some time to himself to pursue his hobbies.\n\nIf the genders were reversed everyone would be lining up to call the dude a controlling asshole and chime in that he needs to help out around the house.", "This. One of the girls I dated disliked me playing games, yet she had no problem watching korean drama for 5 hours straight", "Like it\u2019s fine if that her red line, but she has already said she is done with the relationship, and at 22 years old? Too young for that type of drama. Date another gamer or someone that is ok with that.", "I can also almost guarantee you think you\u2019re doing all the chores, but it\u2019s a bunch of things you haven\u2019t actively thought about that she gets done.

Regardless, I agree they are probably just not compatible", "that is the vibe i got, he is also an outlet for her controlling and insecure bullshit", "they \"lightly\" blacked out. They disabled posting, that was it.", "Someone didn\u2019t read the story then bc that\u2019s not what he does lol. 3 days a week 1-2 hours of game. You\u2019re telling me you need THAT much attention that your partner can\u2019t have some of their own time? Extremely unhealthy for a relationship js.", "It's the every night where it gets a lot. With a sport you might have a busy season or have a couple of nights a week where you are out playing, but it's not an every night kind of thing. Personally, I like to hike, so I'll go hiking one day a week or I go to a yoga class one or two nights, but it's not an all the time kind of thing. I do think it's a little sad to go a whole week without seeing your partner unless their out of town, but I understand that's not the same for everyone.", "You don't have a girlfriend; you have a lifetime of misery if you continue with her.", "I'm a \"traditional woman.\" If my boyfriend's here I don't take out the trash, I don't assemble furniture, I don't mow the lawn,  I won't change my own tire, pump my gas, carry heavy stuff, drive etc \nBut \"traditional\" roles for women include cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare.

Like WTF. There is no winning with this sub.", "Then why are you here?\n\nI love when people claim stuff like this. You guys are so obsessed with Reddit that you see every post as soon as it's posted and only focus on the first group of people rather than what the majority actually voted for over time.", "It's not even every day, it's maybe a couple days a week!", "My friend, she is not good to you. She uses you. She pushes unhealthy expectations of men on you, shits on your hobbies, and is mean to you from what you've said. \nNow might be a good time to evaluate what you deserve versus what you're getting.", "Where does it say she doesn't work?\n\nAnd, let's face it, his claim that he does all the housework and chores is pretty unbelievable.", "He says it in one of his comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149a3k6/aita_for_defending_my_hobby_to_my_girlfriend/jo5cqj8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3\n\nApparently, she is in cosmetology school. *shrug*", "Same with books, and I'm a gamer, and I have subtitles on for everything bc reading helps me pay a bit more attention, so yeah lol, I'm there with you for everything", "Even in the most mildest situations, man bad. /s", "Nobody's all bad.

Image was still hilarious though", "I agree, I don\u2019t think this sounds like a crazy amount of gaming. What I think she doesn\u2019t know how to articulate is that she wants to have more quality time with you. Because of her past experiences she blames it on the video games but I bet that if you spent more intentional quality time with her, fully present with her, she would eventually realize that some amount of gaming isn\u2019t going to take much away from her.", "\"you're always playing video games\" - my ex who spent every waking hour playing candy crush style apps on her phone.", "Jesus Christ, he just said he plans multiple dates a week and here you are acting like his mother.

She's trying to manipulate and guilt him it sounds like - which is toxic in its own right. She needs to work her issues out from her ex and not punish her current partner for them.", "INFO: when you were \"zoned out\", did you fail to respond completely, or did you absentmindedly say, \"uh-huh\". \n\nIf the former, she fucked up. If the latter, you fucked up.\n\nSounds like a good opportunity to lay down ground rules about requests (they're fully acknowledged by both parties, etc). \n\nNAH", "Bullshit... She is home all day, why is he doing chores? She wants more time? How about she gets up from her lazy ass and actually do all that stuff so that he has more free time?", "Think about that for a bit.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with it if it doesn\u2019t take over your life and doesn\u2019t interfere in your relationship. Effort matters.

If my husband is playing and I can SEE he is involved in a battle I don\u2019t ask something of him because I know I won\u2019t be heard. It\u2019s like asking someone a question while seeing them reading - honestly kind of rude. He also knows if he responds something like \u201cyeah\u201d and didn\u2019t actually hear me, I\u2019m going to be aggravated. I feel like you both could just use better communication.

OP is the only one working, he pays for everything, does ALL the housework, ALL the pet care, and it's up to him to plan ALL the dates/time they spend together, while girlfriend literally sits on her lazy ass all day. But because he spends a few hours a week playing games, he's not doing enough for her, WTF!? Could you all be anymore sexist!? If the genders were reversed, you know damn well everyone of you would be saying he's in a toxic controlling relationship. The double standard here is so obvious and disgusting.", "Don't waste time with such a person mate NTA", "The way it is set up now isn\u2019t great.  \n\u201cAsking her permission\u201d to do your \u201chobby\u201d isn\u2019t a great plan.  Asking her \u201cdo I have to spend time with you or I can go do what I want\u201d is how I can pretty much guarantee she is hearing it no matter how you are phrasing the question.  She is put in the place where she feels obligated to say she doesn\u2019t mind you going off to play even if she wants to spend time with you or she\u2019s a bitch.  \n\nHow about instead the two of you sit down and work out a schedule that works for you both.  I am an introvert and don\u2019t like being in a relationship where I have to do every single thing every single night with my husband so I get not wanting to have to do that.  I think it is healthy to have hobbies where you do your thing and she does hers.  But obviously that can\u2019t be every night for \u201ca few hours\u201d.  So sit down and figure it out so there doesn\u2019t have to be a conversation.  Tuesday and Thursday nights after dinner and chores are done you always game until bedtime and then for a 4 hour chunk of time on either Saturday or Sunday you also get to game uninterrupted by her for example.  Then on the other days you don\u2019t bring up gaming at all and the two of you do things together as a couple that you both enjoy.  \nThis way you don\u2019t have to have a discussion, \u201cget permission\u201d every night.   This plan can stay in place until your situation changes - example a baby or pet comes into your lives - and roles need to shift.  \nThe days/hours are obviously an example I pulled out, not what I think you should be doing.  You two should talk and work out days and times that work for both of you and that you both think are fair for your relationship.  \n\nYou are NTA for defending your hobby - you have to realize that she is also not an asshole for having some trauma surrounding this area with past relationships where gamers have abused time and neglected the relationship, and how the two of you are currently handling things.  She\u2019s your partner not your mom.", "Irony is not something everybody can easily recognize.", "Yeah I was about to say the same thing\u2026", "It's funny. \n\nA day back a friend of mine who is on tiktok way more than me told me about this one where a woman said she felt men's hobbies were abusive because they drained household finances, and that men should just go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That their only worth or need in a relationship was to be the financial ATM. Sounds ludicrous to think there are people genuinely like that, and someone wasn't just playing a bit...until comments like in this thread.", "The only thing she brings to the relationship seems to be vagina...", "Not a fellow gamer but I still agree with everything you said."]}
