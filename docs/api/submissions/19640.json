I make sure I sit down and talk with her and make sure everything is good before I sit down for the night before coming to bed. A couple of examples is, I run our laundry, I clean up our room, and I make sure everything is cleaned up and ready so that she never has to worry about anything. I try and remember to do everything she asks as I have borderline ADHD and will sometimes zone out and forget that she asked me to do something. Fast forward to a couple of nights ago, same night as usual but before she went to go shower, she had asked me to put some drinks in the fridge so she had something to drink before bed. I was on the games at that point and was completely zoned out and didn\u2019t hear her tell me. She comes back out and quiet so naturally picking up on this I asked her if everything was ok and she tells me she\u2019s fine. Which obviously means I\u2019ve done something to make her upset. She then proceeds to tell me that I prioritize games over and thats she\u2019s done with it. Me being super confused as to how I\u2019ve been prioritizing it over our relationship, asked how I\u2019ve done that. She then says that I ignore her and that I\u2019m addicted to video games. I then start to defend my position on it as games to me is a hobby and something that I enjoy doing after working all day. I do a fairly good job at buying flowers and making sure she knows that I love her. I\u2019m not the best at that because of my past relationships but I\u2019ve been working on it as I know it\u2019s important to her.

You think a few hours every night parked in front of your game system, completely zoning her out is healthy for a relationship? And btw, it's not a hobby when it consumes all your free time, it is an obsession. She's obviously feeling neglected, and throwing flowers and kisses in the air at her every now and again isn't going to cut it. Unless you're willing to cut back your gaming time drastically and spend more time doing things you both like together, then I think you better break things off and find someone who shares your gaming passion as much as you do.", "NTA. You are allowed your hobbies. Frankly, if your girlfriend has issues with dating gamers, she shouldn\u2019t be dating a gamer.", "NAH - but you both picked wrong.\n\nShe mustn\u2019t date people who game.

The answer to the question may provide you insight into whether you are or are not addicted to gaming.", "Jesus dude, stop kissing her ass and pandering to her, this is painful to read", "NTA.\n\nBut please, my brother, leave that girl. It's never going to get better and she's going to beat you down until you just give up on your hobbies. I've seen this EXACT same scenario happen over and over and over. Get out while you can.", "INFO: what do you mean you have borderline ADHD? Have you been diagnosed with ADHD?", "ESH.  A few hours a night is a lot, not a little time for a hobby.  \n\nBy your description she is right, you are prioritizing gaming if you do your \"chores\" then rush off to do something only you can enjoy instead of suggesting things to do together some nights, or doing something that moves you forward on your life path.  If this is your major free time investment, you might have an addiction.  If you can't stand the thought of not doing it for a few nights or a week, you might have an addiction. \n\nShe is being passive aggressive in her approach by saying \"fine\".

My boyfriend and I are gamers and we always play our video games to wind ourselves down after a long day at work and we also spend time together when we\u2019re not playing our games whether it\u2019s going on fun dates or skateboarding on the bike path. Everyone has hobbies that they enjoy doing. OP is NTA he should reconsider this relationship.", "You are allowed your hobby, if it's something you do a couple of times a week, not a few hours every single night. Given that most people work and need to sleep, something that takes up hours of every day can very well become an issue, if you aren't pulling your weight in the household and sacrificing quality time with your partner. That being said, yes, this girl shouldn't date a gamer.", "A few hours daily is not excessive.", "But then how many hours are you gaming? It seems like you come home, do basic things around the house like laundry (which is not quality time with your gf by the way) and then play video games and ignore your gf for the rest of the night. \n\nThe issue here is the disparity in quality time (not time spent doing household chores) and gaming. You should be spending as much time with your gf as you do gaming, if not more. Also, you should never be so \u201cin the zone\u201d that you 100% tune out your girlfriend. That\u2019s so rude.", "Ok, so how many hours do you play video games during the week vs spend time with her?  Playing video games in the same house is not the same as spending time together.", "That doesn't really answer the question. What does it look like day to day? You said couple of hours. Is it 1-3 or 4-6? And also doing chores is cool but do you spend any time together? It seems to me like you just do the chores only to have that as an excuse to go to your games. Yeah ok you didn't hear her when she asked you about the drinks. Probably wasn't the first time that happened.", "Agreed. Me and my partner share the hobby and enjoying doing it together. If one of us is doing something on a game that's important we respect that, and i cant imagine what it would be like simply trying to unwind but being looked down upon for it. I mean, if the hobby was ANYTHING else, reading, gardening, anything, would it be looked down upon? I think gaming has a negative label sadly. Dating another gamer is totally the way to go.", "She seems to think it is.  \n\nI struggled with gaming addiction before.

He's ABSOLUTELY allowed to spend some of his limited free time on his own hobbies, which for him, is gaming. His gf is clearly taking out her own issues on him. If she doesn't want a bf that games, then that's her prerogative, but based on the information provided - he's not doing anything wrong. They're just in the wrong relationship.", "1-2 hours.

There isn't that much time left after a work day and there's a big difference between 2 hours and 6. You talk about a lot of 'performative' actions like chores and flowers but what about quality time?  \nRight now it's hard to determine whether she's reacting this way because she's afraid of the past repeating itself or because the past is already repeating itself.", "I would say NTA.

Your gf has had several partners who all seem to have the exact same problem. At some point, you have to wonder if she's the common denominator.

The fact that you do your chores, then ask her if she's okay with you playing beforehand is a very important detail. Also, playing a game for two hours a few times a week (not for hours on end every day like it sounds like in your post) is not the same as coming home and ignoring your girlfriend to game all the time. The people voting Y T A or E S H probably haven't read any of your comments.", "NTA\n\nYou do not need to defend your hobby and you are not responsible for her past experiences.\n\nYour hobby could be anything, it\u2019s not about the hobby, it\u2019s about how prioritizing looks different to the two of you. \n\nIf gaming was such an issue for her, then it should have been a deal breaker at the start - not something that she holds you to the fire for.\n\nThe \u201cfine\u201d is not healthy communication, it\u2019s a trap. \nIf she\u2019s angry and not expressing it directly, you will walk on eggshells trying to figure out what you did wrong. (or land on Reddit)\n\nNot talking to you is also not healthy communication, it\u2019s the silent treatment. \n\nGetting clear on a diagnosis could help with your communication approach in the future, (and hopefully with someone that also games), but as far as this relationship goes - you have some things to decide.", "ESH- a few hours can very excessive, especially after a work day. It\u2019s also not fair of her to get mad at you for unwinding how you want to after work it seems like a lose-lose situation.\n\nIs she completely against gaming with you? There are lots of fun multiplayer games, like maybe you could play Mario Party or Mario Kart together. That way you are gaming whilst also spending time together. It shows her you want to include her in your hobbies.", "NTA. It sounds like your partner has issues with communicating her needs, addressing her own issues, and blaming you for not preparing every thing she wants EG the drinks she wanted you to prepare for her. Immediately going into you about how you are addicted to games sounds like a toxic move when she should have done the healthy thing and calmly communicated her needs. Gaming isn\u2019t a sin it\u2019s a hobby, no different than sewing, crossword puzzles, or photography. It\u2019s not your responsibility to coddle your girlfriend\u2019s toxicity when she\u2019s not even able to healthily communicate her own desires.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m reading your comments, and seeing that you ask permission to turn on your console and game?  This is not healthy. You should not have to ask permission to do a solo hobby. Would it be healthy if she wanted to spend a couple hours gardening per night and she couldn\u2019t do it without having permission granted?

You're incompatible and she sounds like she's abusing your honest efforts to work on the relationship.", "Seems he is treating gf like he would his mother and gf is unwillingly being thrust into that role. If you were my bf and came home to game every evening I would say it wouldn't be long before I lost interest in you entirely and went off to look for someone more suitable.", "I would say soft YTA. My fianc\u00e9 and I both enjoy gaming after a long day at work when we are too tired to go out. He likes a variety of games, I like one. If he spends hours playing, or I spend hours playing, we\u2019re not giving each other the attention and time each deserve. We compromise, we play together, taking turns, watching the other and hyping each other up. But we will cap it, at 30 minutes- hour. And we don\u2019t play every night, like two nights a week. So we aren\u2019t spending our whole night engrossed. We will have a show we watch together or take turns picking movies, or we will go for a walk or go do something together (like pickle ball for example). I get where you are coming from with the gaming. I am introverted and being at work all day socializing drains me. Sometimes I just need 30 minutes sitting playing a game to get recharged, and then I\u2019m good for the night. But even if I want to play video games for 4 hours, I don\u2019t. I put my relationship first, that\u2019s how it always should be. We communicate when we had an extra hard day, and what we can give to each other, and what our needs are.", "Nta but when you say all the chores do you mean all of your share or literally everything?", "ESH\n\nYou both need to communicate better. None of this immature silent treatment and \"I'm fine, its all good\" when clearly it isn't. Relationships are about compromise and communication and not letting resentment build up. you both need to step up and say what you need so that you both are on the same page.", "A few hours every night is a lot. Sounds like her current boyfriend prioritizes gaming above her too. YTA. You spend more time gaming than quality time with her.", "NTA. You're being a solid partner and she's taking her trauma out on you and being unreasonable. If she keeps this up, it might be time to part ways.", "get rid of the dog", "I can't judge this. You do 100% of the household chores which is unfair to you. You not replying when in a game is annoying, but easy to solve in a relationship with some communication. Playing a few hours of video games each night seems excessive, and I wouldn't want to be in a relationship like that. But again, that's not an AH move, just different ways to spend your time.\n\nSo, what exactly is the issue between the two of you? Can you pinpoint where you're the asshole, or she is? Is it about expectations, attention, division of labor, ..?", "I was that girlfriend. My boyfriend then started reintroducing me. I played as a child. When we fought; we would play mortal kombat and I became so good that I stopped losing. He found games we okay together and things we do separately. I love him for it, it\u2019s a good stay at home hobby. He does a majority of house work but I work 10 hours 5 days a week. He\u2019s very much my rock. I think you need to have a serious talk and explain to her that she can\u2019t expect a house made and unlimited time. You deserve 1-2 hours.

She needs to get it together", "NTA - She knows what she's getting into when she dates a gamer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe can date a non gamer. You can date a fellow gamer.

If you haven't been diagnosed, you shouldn't add to the stigma by applying it to your behavior.", "ESH\n\nYour girlfriend simply wants to enjoy all the enjoyable things if a relationship without the effort then gets mad at you when you want to relax. If she did some chores or helped plan something that would free up time on your end by not doing basic chores and spend time with her. \n\nOn the other hand you have to ask and lowkey guilt trip her into letting you spend ur time with your hobby.

She does not have to worry about doing any of it because she asks me to do it all.\n\nOk, so what does she do exactly? Because if you're working, and doing all the household chores, and looking after the dogs it begs the question what she's doing to occupy her time enough beyond maybe cooking, because I think someone who just leaves her shoes about and creates unnecessary work for others shouldn't be this persnickety about your hobby? Does she pay all the bills? Is this relationship equitable or is it just all about her with the gaming being the last holdout she hasn't eroded out of you.\n\nLike, I get it, she's had bad experiences. Hell, I'd say a not insignificant amount of women like your girlfriend have, hence the projection in the comments, but as you've said in other comments and the main OP you don't actually game every night, and you only play a couple of hours. Which, btw, a couple of hours is nothing for hobbies in general just ask the literary community how often they said, \"Another chapter.\" You also ask permission before doing. Your girlfriend also knows you have ADHD, which you are managing yes, but there are going to be slip ups and gaming isn't to blame for that when a zone out can occur for really any reason.\n\nIt sounds like your girlfriend is just always going to make your hobby about herself, and every little misstep will come down to it. That isn't on you, that's on her for needing to seek therapy before dating again.\n\nNTA and this relationship sounds like it's spiraling the drain, because she has issues.", "NTA my bf is a gamer.
