YTA", "YTA", "YTA\nThe audacity to ask for a bite of her food", "LMAO hahaha you kinda are but I know it wasn't malicious. Asking for a bite LMAOOOO I either would have done the same as her or would genuinely laugh and forget the anger", "YTA why didn't you make the 4 schnitzels and she could just reheat them?", "YTA- you thought about yourself which is very selfish", "He\u2019s in a lose lose situation he didn\u2019t make them he\u2019s an asshole he makes them they are cold he\u2019d still be an asshole", "Yeah YTA, living with partner ALWAYS cook enough for them and leabe it. Do ya not have a microwave or something? Wtf", "YTA my guy. It\u2019s not abt the schnitzel just like it wasn\u2019t about the Iranian yogurt. You didn\u2019t consider anyone\u2019s feelings but your own, and placed your comfort over hers. If you were still eating when she arrived, her schnitzel wouldn\u2019t have gotten cold. You seem selfish. Perhaps try to make it up to her and make her something nice another time this week. You did a dumb thing and hopefully this isn\u2019t a character flaw but a one time mistake. Apologize and try to make it up to her.", "ESH you asking for some of her food, and her being mad for you not having dinner ready, but not telling you when she was actually leaving.", "He says they \u201ccool together\u201d and based on his comments im 100% sure it\u2019s just him hovering over her and making \u201csuggestions\u201d", "It\u2019s not about the schnitzel and it was never about the Iranian yogurt.", "i hope he\u2019s an ex because you bashed him over the head with your plate one good time", "And timed it well too", "He put the frying pan in the sink, but didn't wash it.", "He put it in the sink, so it was dirty with water and soap. Didn't wash it but also didn't leave it on top for her.", "You know, I really think you are in the wrong career. Evaluating possible future scenarios and thinking about various possibilities is very important in many different subjects. \n\nYTA.", "Well hey, now you know. You\u2019re self-centered. It\u2019s okay, but learn from this. Just like you work on your academia and research, you need to work on yourself too, and this is a massive issue. Learn how to think about what others around you might need/want and learn to take steps of your own accord to take care of some of those needs.", "Also he could've kept them warm in the oven... op didn't use their brain on this one", "she works 10 minutes from your house. and she was late because it was raining too hard to walk. so you knew once it stopped raining she would be home. and somehow *thats* the exact time you decided to make yourself dinner.  and then put the pan in the sink so she couldn\u2019t use it immediately. \n\nyou were inconsiderate, not her. especially since she usually cooks for you! the least you could have done was made some for her too.", "God. Literally everyones calling you an AH and still you don't see it. Shame the college system you attend isn't giving you any critical thinking skills...", "Op says he put it in the sink..... Op YTA!", "Haha I knew that would show up!", "No, you did NOT have to. You could\u2019ve been nice and cooked her something, you could\u2019ve set everything up for her and cooked with her, or you could\u2019ve at least cleaned the pan so you can cook with her.\n\nInstead you do the exact opposite", "I guess next time wait to be sure. Also, would it have killed you to pause your eating and say \"dear, let me whip you up a meal and we can eat together, I still have some left!\" I mean, you come off kind of lazy and do not seem excited to see her. Is that the impression you want to give her?", "Ngl I love seeing it pop up like an Easter egg \ud83e\udd23", "just commenting because im also autistic and it might help you to read this- youre a giant asshole", "What is half of 100%?\n\nRight, that's how much household chores are yours to do. Without being asked.", "With other dirty dishes, but didn't wash it.", "Do me a favor and hit your head a few times against the wall see if it helps....YTA", "Hah; I like how his \"being in math\" is a condition like the Asperger's. Ps OP YTA. Just text her \"hey I'm gonna fry these two up, are you leaving soon and want me to make 2 for you too or nah?\" Not challenging stuff no matter what you're otherwise doing with your very important mathy brain at the time.", "I do this too. I'd much rather wash each item as I go than have a sink full of dirty dishes at the end of the night.", "So the pan was still just schnitzel grease", "I agree that communication is important. But she also could have asked him to heat up food. Unless they have a normal routine where it is expected that he makes food for her when she gets home late from work. I feel like if she is just expecting food to be on the table when she is home then she should ask him to make it.", "If you didn\u2019t know when she would be back, and you only have one frying pan, you should have a) washed it right away or b) left it out until you were done eating so if she came home she could make herself schnitzels/her own food right away. I do think once she got home it would have been nice for you to wash the pan immediately and fry her up the rest of the schnitzels, seeing as she was eating like an hour later than usual and was probably very hungry. I don\u2019t think that alone makes you an AH, just a bit thoughtless in this situation, but what really did it was you asking for a bite of her food.", "That alone makes you TA, without the other stuff even. You knew it was going to be needed. Put a lid on it and leave it on the oven. \n\nI personally would have fried all the Schnitzel because she will come home some time in the next few hours and will need food. \n\nMaybe you should think about a career change, planning and thinking ahead are important skills in academia and you don't seem to have them.", "Lmao you're hilarious man", "\"It took her food and hour to get there! She could have fried the schnitzel in that time!\"\n\nShe didn't want to wash your soiled pan that you so graciously left her. YTA and inconsiderate.", "So basically you\u2019re selfish. You only look out for yourself and don\u2019t bother to do anything for your girlfriend? Really OP", "Maybe you should do it more often. Twice a week is the absolute minimum. She is not your mom, you know. You are an adult who should be able to do household chores on their own without being asked. \nGrow up."]}
