If you were still eating when she got home, then the others wouldn\u2019t have been cold.\n2. Wash the damn pan so she could make more.\n3. You SERIOUSLY then had the nerve to ask for a bite of her food? \n\nYeah, you\u2019re the AH.", "Sorry but I\u2019ll have to give you a YTA.\n\nYou were fine\n\n>I asked her if I could take a bite too\n\nBut then you did this. That is a selfish thing to ask after you didn\u2019t at least fry up the other 2 for her. If it would\u2019ve gotten cold, I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t have mind heating them back up", "YTA\n\nFrying up the 2 other schnitzels would have taken minimal effort.  Worst case, she could have microwaved them to heat them back up when she got back about an hour later.\n\nThen, asking her for a bite of **her** food, which arrived around 8 PM or so, just is the icing on the AH cake.\n\nIn the future, if your girlfriend usually eats with you, prepare her food and set it aside.  It's a **lot** easier just to reheat cold food than to prepare it completely.  Or, talk to her and ask what she wants you to do in terms of food \"Want me to prepare you some food?  It may be cold by the time you get back.\"\n\nCommunication would have avoided all of this.", "YTA. It's not about the schnitzels. It's being thoughtful to your partner, who was stuck at work for over an extra hour, in a bad storm. Making the extra effort to reach out to see how it was going and when she would be home, and have some food ready for her when she did get home is the kind of thing you do for someone you care about.  \n\n\nBut you were doing your \"very important stuff\" and got distracted, I guess. Then the gall to ask her for a bite of her very late dinner.  \n\n\nI wonder if this thoughtlessness is part of a pattern and that's why she was veeery upset?", "I was kinda with you until you asked for a bite.

You didn't ask when she would be home, you didn't ask if she had plans for dinner - oh but YOUR VERY IMPORTANT STUFF - but she was at work and her work isn't important? So it was entirely on her? YTA and you know it but you're going to argue anyway. And the biggest YTA point is,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow in the hell would the food have been cold if you were literally still in the middle of eating it? You didn't make her food because you didn't think of her or care to ask - so when she got home you didn't tell her, hey, I'm almost done and I can make you some! You didn't offer any solution. You blamed HER for not TELLING YOU. Take some of the initiative and the mental load. AND THEN YOU ASKED HER FOR A BITE OF HER FOOD. When you went out of your way to not help out when she got stuck at work lmAO. Stop this.", "YTA not because you didn\u2019t make her food or wash the pan immediately after cooking because you had no way of knowing she would be back she should have messaged saying i am on my way home so you would know to cook more but YTA for asking for a bite of her food you had your dinner let her have hers if your still hungry make a snack like how entitled are you", "Cold schnitzel is delicious! What were you thinking?", "YTA you were only thinking of yourself. What type of partner only cooks enough dinner for yourself when you know your GF is on her way home.

Apologize and don't do it again.", "This feels like it is about a lot more than just a couple of schnitzels tbh. INFO needed.", "ESH. This could\u2019ve all been avoided if either of you had simply communicated with each other about dinner plans. I think it was very unnecessary of you to ask for a bite of her food when she was already upset with you. I also think she overreacted by getting angry with you for not making her dinner when she hadn\u2019t asked you to do so in the first place, but it would have been good of you to text/call her and talk about dinner plans also. So yeah, ESH.", "NAH\n\nNext time just text her and ask if she wants you to make it or if she wants you to leave it for her so she can make it hot.\n\nWhen you realised that you effed up you should have gotten up and quickly cleaned the pan and offered to make the other two.  When she is already pissed at you because you made dinner for yourself only, left a mess in the kitchen and didn't offer her anything, that is a very inappropriate time to then ask her to share the takeout she had to order because you effed up.  Take a hint.  I don't think YTA but I do think you sound really clueless.", "NTA\n\nShe could have easily done them herself, it takes 10 minutes.

She should have told you she was on her way if she was expecting dinner to be ready for her. \n\n5. She way overreacted, when this was just a communication problem. \n\n6.

She told you she was going to be late. That was probably her way of asking you to put off dinner for a bit or check up on her.\n\nFrankly, you sound like you're a very selfish partner and like she possibly carries a lot of the mental load of the relationship. Add on that you asked her for a bite of her food she had to wait an extra hour for when she was probably annoyed with you, cold, cranky, and starving, and you come across as someone who probably ticks off a lot of people and doesn't know why. Empathy, my dude. Learn it.", "Holy shit men like you are selfish assholes. Heave forbid you ever think about your partner for a moment", "I don\u2019t usually cook, she cooks when she gets back home or we cook together.", "That's even worse, dude. You cooked for yourself without checking because you were hungry, knowing that your girl was out there stuck because of shitty weather. You didn't think of her at all because you're selfish. I mean, own that? But don't be surprised that she's upset about it. She might just be starting to realize what kind of person she's with. You could have been a great guy and made an actual meal for both of you that might have been ready by the time she got there. Instead, you fended for yourself, then tried to scavenge when she was hangry. \n\nFor an academic, you're doing a good job of playing dumb."]}
