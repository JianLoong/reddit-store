Why didn't you just leave the pan out ffs?\n3. You then had the *balls* to ask for a bite of her food? Knowing that she was already pissed at you, and knowing that you had done absolutely *nothing* to make her day easier, you genuinely expected her to do something nice for *you*? That's what really cinches the self-centred mindset for me. You could not spare a single thought for her needs, but you still expected her to give up some of her food for *you.* Wow. Way to communicate to your wife that nothing matters to you except your needs and your wants.\n\nFyi, asperger's/autism is not an excuse. People with autism are capable of *learning* correct behaviours from others, and you literally admitted in a comment that every time your wife cooks (which is often), she makes dinner for you too. So you could have - and *should* have - learned from watching her that cooking for your partner is a normal expectation. Like seriously, how do you think every other aspie on the planet copes? They watch NT people and figure it out, just like you were given the opportunity to.\n\nAlso, your work isn't an excuse either.
