I also work at a restaurant and  getting upset with a customer for placing an order an hour before closing is just ridiculous. I understand that it was a large order but you made it clear that you understood that it might take some time and that you were okay with it.

You didn't do anything wrong.", "\n\nNTA. You did exactly the right thing in ordering the food and you handled the situation well. It is understandable that restaurant workers may not want to serve a large order so close to closing time, but they should be professional and courteous about it.

This guy is a dick.", "NTA\n\nMost fast food places cook almost up to close. Sounds like the worker didn't want to stay for clean up.", "Lemme guess.....Popeyes? Employees are known to have a bad temper...", "Former fast food worker here: the kitchen is open until the last order placed before closing time, so potentially and quite often until after closing time.  If the place closes at 10, you can place an order at 9:59.  Schedules for most employees rarely end at closing time, but continue for 30-60 minutes beyond.", "Ehh there is a point where you\u2019re the asshole. Trying to sit down 10 minutes before closing is an asshole thing to do. Yeah technically still open but you\u2019re still an asshole in that situation", "The manager should have sent him to the back, away from the customer or just sent him home. He obviously doesn't need to be there with that attitude.", "It's not hard to tell. If the order is placed before closing, it gets made.", "And two people can continue making the order while others start the cleaning. I have done that plenty of times. With a half way decently ran restaurant, it would be doable. But this place sounds like a nightmare. The manager didn't even step up and get the annoying employee out of the FOH. They should have given that person BOH cleaning, far away from the customer. Or straight up sent them home. That behavior is never acceptable.", "Agreed. Id judge diff had that been the case here - also still waiting for your post about the speed limits..", "Yeah In this case there was well over an hour left. Get to cooking!! Although at that point you may as well just leave since they\u2019re probably going to do a shit job. They don\u2019t sound like great employees", "NTA\n\nOver an hour before closing is a completely reasonable time to order from a restaurant.\n\nWalking in minutes before close is generally considered an asshole move, but they shouldn't be advertising opening hours if they won't be available for orders.\n\nI can understand staff wanting to clean up early and get home promptly, but that is the exception, and they shouldn't have any complaints about having to work.\n\nA lot of restaurants won't operate this way, but it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect restaurants to be available during their full opening hours (as long as your order will be ready before closing time), and that they set aside a suitable length of time after closing to complete whatever cleaning and shutdown procedures are required.", "NTA sounds like that staff member needs to find a new job over an hour before closing is expected they're going to still get ordered", "Hi, service industry here. NTA. Going in over an hour before close is completely acceptable! NTA.", "NTA- I worked in a fast food restaurant for 8 months and let me tell you your nta. They had plenty of time to prepare it and it's not like you showed up 2 minutes before they closed and ordered a bunch. I've had that happen. You were respectful and the manager needs to keep their crew in line.", "Hard NTA I work a similar job and full cooking chicken takes about 50 minutes. They had nearly half an hour to close after prepping your order and they could\u2019ve started some people on cleaning while your order was finishing as well. They\u2019re not using the entire kitchen to cook your food. Employee was just annoyed they had to actually do their job and was trying to deflect onto you so they wouldn\u2019t look like an asshole.", "Even if it was 15 minutes before. I bet the owner of the restaurant would want to take that order.", "Yep, exactly. If it was a lot closer to closing time I\u2019d probably have asked what they could do most easily and picked my order from that, but a whole hour? Unless it\u2019s something that explicitly says it takes a long time on the menu (not a thing at fast food places) or my order is unreasonably large (so they wouldn\u2019t fill it without a pre-order any time of day) then an hour should be plenty of time.", ">getting upset with a customer for placing an order an hour before closing is just ridiculous.\n\nIf one of my managers heard me complaining loudly about customers making me do my job in front of/in earshot of customers that would be my ass. I and any of my colleagues would get reamed for being so unprofessional and giving such poor customer service. The grumping and complaining should never ever reach the customer in any way other than slightly rushed or substandard product, which if done correctly is punishment enough if you're really steamed.", "See this is the way to do it\n\nHave the restaurant stop accepting orders long before the staff go home\n\nWhile it's a grocery store, not a restaurant my workplace does a similar thing where they have front end staff there until 15 minutes past closing, which allows them enough time to complete closing tasks or clear the line if there still is one at closing\n\nAnd all else fails, the closing manager is there an hour past closing, so they can take over should the front end staff not be able to clear the line by shift end (which I've never seen happen)", ">Trying to sit down 10 minutes before closing is an asshole thing to do. \n\nThe only restaurant I ever worked in, last seating was 30 mins before the kitchen closed, and an hour before the restaurant closed. Drives me mad that there's places that seem to have last seating, kitchen close and restaurant close all at the same time.", "I agree. But they can't complain to the costumer about that", ">With a half way decently ran restaurant\n\nIt's wild to me how badly some restaurants are ran. I have a few friends in restaurant industry, and good places have 3 closing times. First when they stop accepting new orders, second when they tell people to leave and third when the staff finishes cleanup. It's good for clients (transparent when they can and cannot order) and for the staff (they know their actual working hours).", "Worked at a cafe a few years back like this. It closed at 5 but at 4.50 a group of 4 walked in while I was sweeping the empty room and ordered the most time consuming dishes from the menu. Ended up working an extra 2 hours that day after redoing all the cleaning (had already cleaned most of the machines before they came in)", "Wait, this isn't standard?? That's wild."]}
