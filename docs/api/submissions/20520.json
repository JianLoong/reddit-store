I also work at a restaurant and  getting upset with a customer for placing an order an hour before closing is just ridiculous. I understand that it was a large order but you made it clear that you understood that it might take some time and that you were okay with it.

Sounds like he should find a new job.\n\n\n\u201cWhy do I have to work when I\u2019m still on the clock\u201d sounds pretty stupid, doesn\u2019t it.

You didn't do anything wrong.", "\n\nNTA. You did exactly the right thing in ordering the food and you handled the situation well. It is understandable that restaurant workers may not want to serve a large order so close to closing time, but they should be professional and courteous about it. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but it should not be expressed in such a negative manner.", "INFO : How large of an order?", "If you showed up ten minutes to close than maybe you\u2019d be an AH. Since you were there more than an hour before close on what other workers said was a slow night, you shouldn\u2019t feel bad even.

The worker said there\u2019s \u201cno chicken\u201d so was it a crazy amount of food?\n\nNothing else indicates you\u2019re TA but I\u2019d love a ballpark answer.

Employees are known to have a bad temper...", "Former fast food worker here: the kitchen is open until the last order placed before closing time, so potentially and quite often until after closing time.  If the place closes at 10, you can place an order at 9:59.  Schedules for most employees rarely end at closing time, but continue for 30-60 minutes beyond.", "Ehh there is a point where you\u2019re the asshole. Trying to sit down 10 minutes before closing is an asshole thing to do. Yeah technically still open but you\u2019re still an asshole in that situation", "The manager should have sent him to the back, away from the customer or just sent him home. He obviously doesn't need to be there with that attitude.", "It's not hard to tell. If the order is placed before closing, it gets made.", "And two people can continue making the order while others start the cleaning. I have done that plenty of times. With a half way decently ran restaurant, it would be doable. But this place sounds like a nightmare. The manager didn't even step up and get the annoying employee out of the FOH. They should have given that person BOH cleaning, far away from the customer. Or straight up sent them home. That behavior is never acceptable.", "Agreed. Id judge diff had that been the case here - also still waiting for your post about the speed limits..", "Yeah In this case there was well over an hour left. Get to cooking!! Although at that point you may as well just leave since they\u2019re probably going to do a shit job. They don\u2019t sound like great employees"]}
