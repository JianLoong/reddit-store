Last weekend, Tom and I went to dinner with his family, and his sister \u201cCarrie\u201d noticed a necklace that I always wear (she makes jewellery) and asked about it. \n\nThe necklace is just a yellow pendant, but Carrie asked about the stone because she thought it might be a birthstone. I told her it wasn\u2019t, and that it was a yellow diamond. She remarked that it was an unusual size and cut for a pendant, and I explained that the stone used to be a ring, but my friend had had it reset into a necklace and given it to me.\n\nThe backstory of this is the stone originally belonged to my family friend \u201cAlex\u201d. Alex\u2019s mother is my dad\u2019s ex girlfriend, and the stone was from a ring my dad had given to Alex\u2019s mom. Alex and I went through something pretty traumatic a few years ago, and Alex took the stone out of the ring and made it into a necklace to give to me, following that traumatic event. \n\nI explained this to Carrie, who thought it was a sweet story, and we went on with dinner. Tom seemed off for the whole of dinner but I didn\u2019t know why. He was off for a couple more days before I pressed him and he told me he was upset and embarrassed that I shared the story at dinner with his family. He said he feels like I deliberately kept the fact that the diamond came from a promise ring from him and that I should have told him the whole story. I don\u2019t see how the whole story of the stone makes a difference, Tom knew the necklace was a gift from Alex and that was really all the relevant information. I only told the rest of the story because Carrie queried the stone specifically. \n\nTom is still mad and says he\u2019s worried I\u2019m keeping other things from him, but I really don\u2019t think I \u201ckept\u201d this from him, more it just never came up. If I wanted to keep it from him I never would have told Carrie either. Tom is saying his family are suspicious about my relationship with Alex now and it\u2019s making him look bad, which I think is ridiculous and probably untrue. \n\nAm I missing something? Should I have told him the whole long story of a necklace I got years before I even met him? Does not telling him make me the AH?", "created_utc": 1702557548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18i7r0f/aita_for_apparently_embarrassing_my_boyfriend_by/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "My dad dated this woman, gave her a ring, they broke up, she gave ring to her kid, who got the stone made into a pendant for me after we went through some rough times. Unless you and Alex were romantically involved I don\u2019t see the issue. Were you romantically involved?", "NTA. You are entitled to have your past without making excuses for it. You told your bf the facts about that necklace. There were some details that you hadn't told him, but why should you. I get exhausted just by thinking of having to explain every details of your posessions to your boyfriend. You and he should be focused on the present and the future, not the past that you can't change anyway.", "NTA, he sounds very insecure, prepare yourself for a lot more questioning and jealousy! We all know how people like this get on with more time", "This is completely bizarre. Tom is being a dramatic weirdo about this. NTA.", "NTA your bf's red flags are showing.", "NTA\n\nInsecure behavior is a red flag. Either he trusts you or you can't be together.  Not having mentioned something previously is not the same thing as hiding something. Not discussing every aspect of every story is normal. You need to be firm about confronting him about his level of trust in you and very clear that for the relationship to work, neither of you can tolerate jealous or controlling behavior.", "NTA \nI think you bf is now suspicious about your relationship with Alex. Not his Family", "NTA. You did tell him the relevant information. Why does he think you should have told him? Because it was a gift from your dad to his then-girlfriend- is he creeped out by it or something? Just weird. How is this embarrassing-because he didn\u2019t know every little thing about you? Or because he felt cuckolded once his family knew it was from another man? That\u2019s ludicrous. There\u2019s something going on and he has got to have better reasoning.", "NTA.  What an odd thing to be upset about.  You weren't deliberately keeping a secret like it was something untoward.  If Tom was so concerned about it, why didn't he ask about the necklace?", "NTA. You\u2019re a human being and you were living your life long before he came along. You don\u2019t need to provide him or his family with an exhaustive inventory of your life or your jewellery. In my view, the way he\u2019s behaving is a huge red flag. It\u2019s weird and controlling and judgmental and yuck.", "NTA. He never asked about the backstory of the necklace. It just never came up it seems. It\u2019s not like you kept it from him on purpose. I\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve told him about it willingly if it ever came up, and like you said you wouldn\u2019t have told the whole story in front of them. I don\u2019t exactly see how a necklace would make him look bad, if anything that says more about the family for making assumptions. It was in the past, and the necklace itself resembles the event you went through and the fact that you got survived it.", "NTA, this is strange behaviour keep a note of this, it's a bit of a red flag if you ask me", "Are you supposed to provide an inventory of every single thing you own and the story behind them? I wore jewelry from my ex yesterday because it matched. Did I make a big deal out of it and tell my husband?  No because it's just jewelry and honestly he doesn't care... we have trust and love.  So this necklace has meaning bc of whatever it was you went through.   I know you didn't date but even if you had, so what. \n\nDepending on how you answered them with the story they may be suspicious.  \"Alex an I went through something traumatic and he reset this rare diamond into a necklace for me\" leaves open questions you may consider clearing up,  but you never have to share if you don't want to.\n\nEither way you are NTA.", "NTA. The fact that he thinks *you* are making *him* look bad by sharing a personal story tells you all you need to know about him.

Whether you were involved with Alex or not is irrelevant.", "OP - Maybe you should sit him down and tell him everything that you went through with Alex before he gave you the stone, if you haven't already. It's not that you kept it deliberately and if you and Alex had more of a relationship then you wouldn't be with your boyfriend now, I'm sure. Your boyfriend just seems a little insecure and maybe just needs reassuring that everything is on the level at this point. What your friend Alex did for you was an awesome gesture and the ring was bought by your father, so technically he was only giving you back something that your dad has purchased and that his mother no longer needed. Your past is your own and you owe nobody reasoning behind it, but if your boyfriend is important to you sit him down and tell him the whole story, it could ease his mind.", "NTA. Your husband is being ridiculous", "NTA \nWe all have a past. We all have friends and family whom we sharing life experiences with. He sounds petty jealous and untrusting. Your necklace sounds beautiful.", "NTA. But you seem to have a boyfriend who is so insecure he gets upset over nothing. You were asked a question about the stone and you answered it. If Tom had asked about it earlier, you would have answered him also. But there is absolutely no reason why you should be responsible for somehow foreseeing that he might be upset irrationally about some part of a back story that has no relevance to your relationship. You need to just tell him he is being ridiculous, you have kept no secrets from him because you have not told him every single detail about any aspect of your past existence. Or you could book him for, say, several hours each evening to tell him the story of your life starting from your earliest memory and going through everything you remember from that time onwards, including all relevant back stories. Could take months though, so warn him it will take time.", "Definitely NTA since you and Alex were never a thing.", "NTA. He sounds like an insecure turd. Hide that necklace until you find a man that's secure in himself.", "Nta your bf sounds over dramatic, he knew Alex gave you the ring and I saw your comments that you never dated him.", "Oh, ffs. NTA. He's being ridiculous. Shut this down hard and if he continues to sulk, dump him. Unreasonable people seldom stop being unreasonable, they just escalate.", "NTA. Tom sounds really insecure.", "NTA but Tom is and he should fix whatever his issue is.", "NTA \n\nYou and Alex could\u2019ve been siblings !!!", "NTA - Regardless of the finer details you did disclosed that it was from Alex to him. If he did have further concerns or questions about Alex and the necklace, then he would have asked. As someone else pointed out if you are trying to hide it or lie about then why talking about it openly? As a guy I really don't give 2 poops about how, who and where you got your jewelry from before the relationship began. Your BF sounds a lot like my GF tbh. If you expect this behaviour to change, unfortunately it won't. On that note he might have 90% good everything else. So let's not judge him on one occasion.  We all have \"Red Flags\" we're imperfect people, loving and living with other imperfect people. It's when it's gets harmful or dangerous or multi red flags is when you cut bait. Maybe something in his past trigger this behaviour? I think he listens to his family too much, this is something I would have shut down fast on them talking like that. IMHO", "Nta at all . I don't understand what difference it makes that the stone came from a promise ring . Your bf just sounds like he wants something to be sour about", "NTA.  Tom is being unreasonable.

OP's dad gave the ring to his GF (Alex's ETA: MOM) as a promise ring.\n2. Alex and OP are close and shared a traumatic experience.\n3. Alex took the yellow diamond from his mom's promise ring and gifted the pendant to OP platonically.\n4. Tom is insecure because it is a high-value gift from a male friend.\n5.

Maybe. But given the current circumstances, if he can't understand and not be insecure then that's on him.", "NTA\n\nYou are not crazy.

Since you never were with Alex, at worst this \"promise ring\" was from your dad to his romantic partner? What's wrong with your bf lmao", "NTA. He's seriously insecure about something.

Were you in a car wreck or something? Did your house burn down? Was your parents relationship so awful that you trauma bonded? \n\nBut, no. you aren\u2019t being weird and secretive.

Would you throw it away because you broke up? Would you stop using it? And if your next bf, or for that matter anyone, would ask about it, would you tell the whole story each time? Of course not, that would be cringe and also might set crazy expectations for your current relationship. You tell the story when it is relevant.
