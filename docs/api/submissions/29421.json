Have you noticed her other behaviors changing? Going out less, talking to other people less, doesn't like going outside the house, maybe even her being moody? How's her personal hygiene? It could be something in her that\u2019s getting the best of her when she has acknowledged she needs to do this.\n\nIt really could be just as you say, but it might be something else entirely.", "I must be missing something you said you work 2 weekdays & 2 weeknights that's 4 days not 5. More info needed: Does she live there, does she work, is g/f. exhausted too? You probably should have started back to work with something less hard or less hrs., until you were strong enough.", "Again, I fucking hate redditors. \n\nNTA. She makes promises and breaks them repeatedly. Don't care about anything else. If you make a promise, you should keep it.\n\nTo the redditors who made him qualify whether she works or not...get fucked. Reverse the genders in this situation and see how your answer would change. Or lie to yourself that \"it wouldn't change.\"\n\nWomen dodging accountability,as per fucking usual.", "Broken promises turn into lies after repeatedly telling someone they'll help and they don't help. I mean stop saying you'll help if you can't or ain't going to. Because it's a lie. I'd rather someone to tell me no rather than to lie to me.", "NTA. It might not be fully her fault though. \n\nTo me it sounds that she\u2019s either never learned how to clean properly or she\u2019s got depression or she\u2019s lazy or she\u2019s got Autism/ADHD. Or a combination of those. \n\nIs there a reason why she doesn\u2019t work? It\u2019s very unusual not to work unless an underlying mental health condition is preventing her. Or you\u2019re forcing her to stay home or she\u2019s physically so ill that she can\u2019t work (and therefore can\u2019t clean the house). \n\nIt might be worth reading about depression and Asperger\u2019s/ADHD. Again, she might just be lazy, but almost nobody is just lazy. In over 90% of the cases an underlying condition is preventing her from building up the energy to clean the house. If you don\u2019t think she\u2019s just lazy or doesn\u2019t know how to clean the house then help her find the reason.", "She doesn't work, my doctor did clear me for work, and the apartment was sometimes messy but always cleaned, usually by me.", "She lives here, she doesn't work.", "The way things go about though, is that it makes me feel like I'm being either crazy or asking too much. But I'm stuck between it being a me or her problem.", "Broken promises are worce than lies.", "Thanks... NTA. If she isn't working there is no reason for her not to pick up the majority of the chores. Continued broken promises might be a red flag before you consider future plans.", "Thanks. \n\nNTA. She's got time. Hubs and I have different breaks (we teach in different systems) and the one not working cleans up."]}
