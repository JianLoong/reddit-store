My (31f) mother (65f) is a narcissist. She won't admit she is wrong with anything, so probably isn't aware she's a narcissist. Both parents were abusive. I married my amazing hubby (33m) in 2019. They didn't attend the wedding because I didn't want my dad walking me down the aisle. Feb 2020 my mother sent me a nasty message reprimanding me for selling gifts of jewellery people had given me nearly 10 years prior. So I never responded, they didn't message for my birthday in December & she got told off at a family Christmas that year for that, amongst other things by me & hubby, resulted in NC for another year.\nChristmas 2021 we made peace (she initiated & sent a birthday message) dad died January 2022. Things have been civil since.\n\nPregnant this year with our rainbow baby, our first, she's now a few months old. I never once was sent a message by my mother asking how I was without wanting something in return (photo, visit), despite being told it was a physically traumatic birth (75hrs, lost lots of blood, multiple complications, nearly had an emergency c-section).\n\nFound out today when we were at her house that she sent photos of my child to a colleague of my dads who happens to have the same name. (Have only sent about 11/12 photos in 3 months, have only sent some to keep the peace)\nSo after going over it with hubby, sent a message to my mother saying that photos were sent on the condition they don't get sent to others. That it wasn't her decision to make, she should've asked first, and that we didn't appreciate finding out the colleague had photos of our child (and our child was definitely not her namesake), who said she'd shown it to other people. Said that if she can't agree to the rules regarding photos, she will stop being sent them and only see her granddaughter in person.\nShe hasn't responded yet.\n\nSent something similar to my sister minus the rule agreement, but adding that mum was not in our good books so to speak because sending photos of our daughter to strangers was a huge no no.\nShe responded: \"Firstly, I don't appreciate being reprimanded via text. Secondly, you only ever specifically said social media. \nThirdly, you should probably look up the definition of a namesake as one of the definitions is someone or something having the same name.\"\n\nThey're meant to be coming over on Wednesday morning to drop off presents for Christmas and my birthday.\nI have got my amazing SIL coming that morning so if they do still come I have help with my child and back up if needed, cause she don't take shit from anyone, especially my sister.\n\nNot sure how my mother will respond.

I\u2019m pregnant with my first and will definitely not be putting them on social media but once you send a photo to someone it\u2019s kind of beyond your control what happens with it. You can only protect your kids so much and people are people, they\u2019re probably just excited/proud.\n\nI\u2019m also a little confused what you want from your mother. You went NC with her for a bit but then seem to be upset that she\u2019s not checking in on you more and when you take the initiative, then she responds. I\u2019m not sure if you had a come to Jesus moment but if someone didn\u2019t want to speak to me I definitely wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to initiate conversation with them, especially while they\u2019re pregnant. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m misreading and making a big assumption but I assume this relationship has been rekindled as a result of your fathers passing. If you didn\u2019t have a genuine conversation and nothing has honestly been fixed, things like this are going to keep happening. I definitely understand you want to set boundaries with your family when it comes to your child but I think this one is a little unrealistic. It\u2019s not like she posted them on Facebook. Your mother is grieving the loss of a spouse, she probably feels that since this person knew your father they\u2019re and extension of him and she is probably just proud and happy to have a grandchild. Idk, I get that you guys have a difficult past but I\u2019d try to go through life assuming your family has good intentions. It\u2019s too exhausting otherwise. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t send any photos if it\u2019s bothering you and they can come visit in person.
