My (31f) mother (65f) is a narcissist. She won't admit she is wrong with anything, so probably isn't aware she's a narcissist. Both parents were abusive. I married my amazing hubby (33m) in 2019. They didn't attend the wedding because I didn't want my dad walking me down the aisle. Feb 2020 my mother sent me a nasty message reprimanding me for selling gifts of jewellery people had given me nearly 10 years prior. So I never responded, they didn't message for my birthday in December & she got told off at a family Christmas that year for that, amongst other things by me & hubby, resulted in NC for another year.\nChristmas 2021 we made peace (she initiated & sent a birthday message) dad died January 2022. Things have been civil since.\n\nPregnant this year with our rainbow baby, our first, she's now a few months old. I never once was sent a message by my mother asking how I was without wanting something in return (photo, visit), despite being told it was a physically traumatic birth (75hrs, lost lots of blood, multiple complications, nearly had an emergency c-section).\n\nFound out today when we were at her house that she sent photos of my child to a colleague of my dads who happens to have the same name. (Have only sent about 11/12 photos in 3 months, have only sent some to keep the peace)\nSo after going over it with hubby, sent a message to my mother saying that photos were sent on the condition they don't get sent to others. That it wasn't her decision to make, she should've asked first, and that we didn't appreciate finding out the colleague had photos of our child (and our child was definitely not her namesake), who said she'd shown it to other people. Said that if she can't agree to the rules regarding photos, she will stop being sent them and only see her granddaughter in person.\nShe hasn't responded yet.\n\nSent something similar to my sister minus the rule agreement, but adding that mum was not in our good books so to speak because sending photos of our daughter to strangers was a huge no no.\nShe responded: \"Firstly, I don't appreciate being reprimanded via text. Secondly, you only ever specifically said social media. \nThirdly, you should probably look up the definition of a namesake as one of the definitions is someone or something having the same name.\"\n\nThey're meant to be coming over on Wednesday morning to drop off presents for Christmas and my birthday.\nI have got my amazing SIL coming that morning so if they do still come I have help with my child and back up if needed, cause she don't take shit from anyone, especially my sister.\n\nNot sure how my mother will respond.

I\u2019m pregnant with my first and will definitely not be putting them on social media but once you send a photo to someone it\u2019s kind of beyond your control what happens with it. You can only protect your kids so much and people are people, they\u2019re probably just excited/proud.\n\nI\u2019m also a little confused what you want from your mother. You went NC with her for a bit but then seem to be upset that she\u2019s not checking in on you more and when you take the initiative, then she responds. I\u2019m not sure if you had a come to Jesus moment but if someone didn\u2019t want to speak to me I definitely wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to initiate conversation with them, especially while they\u2019re pregnant. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m misreading and making a big assumption but I assume this relationship has been rekindled as a result of your fathers passing. If you didn\u2019t have a genuine conversation and nothing has honestly been fixed, things like this are going to keep happening. I definitely understand you want to set boundaries with your family when it comes to your child but I think this one is a little unrealistic. It\u2019s not like she posted them on Facebook. Your mother is grieving the loss of a spouse, she probably feels that since this person knew your father they\u2019re and extension of him and she is probably just proud and happy to have a grandchild. Idk, I get that you guys have a difficult past but I\u2019d try to go through life assuming your family has good intentions. It\u2019s too exhausting otherwise. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t send any photos if it\u2019s bothering you and they can come visit in person.

Which is what I was responding to.", "OP might be as unhinged as her mom.... who TF lets their kid around someone who abused them.", "Nah was more a, what I'd do in the name of self defence, defending my child. She hits my child, she gets it back in return. Instant karma.\nYes I was abused, but now I'm more determined to stand up for myself and for my family aka hubby and bub, and if that means doing to her what she does to my bub then so be it.", "True, but I wouldn't put it past my mother to have told her she'd be able to", "ah yes. your mother should\u2019ve totally asked the BABY if she can send the photo to her friend. the more i see you open your mouth, the more it\u2019s apparent that clearly you have some raging inferiority complex and/or inherited narcissism because of the past abuse that you evidently haven\u2019t worked through like you claim you have. and again, if your child said it wasn\u2019t okay, you\u2019d just show your friend the photos in person?? like that makes you any better? what planet are you on?", "Thats so unreasonable lmao. Asking a literal infant, or even a child if you can share their picture with someone you know is nuts. Your mother shared pictures of her granddaughter to someone she knew, not a complete stranger. Did you tell her not to show anybody the pictures? I can understand if she posted them on Facebook or something but come on it really seems like you're just using this one as an excuse. If you don't like your mom, nobody is forcing you to have her in your life.", "No might about it. Did you read the part where op JOKES  about how she will react if mum abuses daughter!!!?.", "Im really trying to not rip into you. A healthy well balanced parent A, doesn't carry on like you are in your replies. Protecting your own children is done with actions not gum flapping and jokes about how you will react if you're mother who abused you, abuses your own kid. You are a narcissist or unhinged", "You sound narcissistic and delusional yourself, OP. Your child is special to YOU, and she should be because you are her mother.   \n\nThe namesake lady? She doesn\u2019t really care. Your child is inconsequential to her. She was being polite when she asked to hold your baby. It does not matter to her whether she does or does not. \n\nNo one really cares about babies that aren\u2019t theirs. Everyone asks to hold babies. They think it\u2019s a compliment to show interest in the thing you\u2019ve worked so hard on growing and feeding and taking care of for 9 months before the miraculous and exhausting feat (75 hours of complicated labor you say?) of giving birth. \n\nShe is a woman, an older woman, who is aware that giving birth comes can come with complications. Just give her the benefit of the doubt unless you have evidence to support malicious intent. SMH", "They said that when I'm a grandparent I'd send photos to my friends. I was saying I wouldnt, I'd ask my daughter first if she was okay with me sending photos of her child to people.\nMy mother should've asked me if I was okay with it. We're her proxy until she can say yes or no herself.\n\nThe people I send photos to are her aunt's and uncles, and they rarely get pictures cause they see her in person a lot. Mainly just birthdays they get a picture. It's mainly her Nanna that gets pictures, hubby's mum.", ">Asking a literal infant, or even a child if you can share their picture with someone you know is nuts\n\nThey're replying to the commenter above about what OP would do if OP was the grandparent. When OP said \"ask my child\", they meant they would ask their adult child (aka the baby's parent) for permission to send photos of their grandchild."]}
