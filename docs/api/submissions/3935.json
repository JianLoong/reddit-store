What is your wife going on about your daughter needing to learn separating wants from needs? I\u2019m sure your daughter is well aware that getting her nails done is a want. You, her father, are more than happy to pay for it so she can have it done. Your wife is the problem here. Sure, going and getting her nails done is not a need, but where does your wife get off deciding that your daughter doesn\u2019t get to have what she wants?

She was pulling a power move to show who was boss.  If that is how she treats your daughter why continue?", "NTA based on your agreement of keeping parenting roles separate for your respective children. However, that's a difficult thing to do when everyone is under one roof. Little things being said like clear the table or do your homework is understandable. But Mia not only completely reversed your permission, there was no strong reason for it but her own claim of morality. There can be all kinds of valid reasons that your daughter wanted to get her nails professionally done, like nail art, etc. Mia was the one who stepped overboard and I think you handled it very rationally by trying to point out her lack of logic. You were not disrespectful. You both need to have a discussion on the parenting rules or the kids are going to get very mixed signals and eventually rebel.", "NTA. But how well is this whole, \"You parent yours, I'll parent mine\" -thing going for you? You are a blended family and kids should be treated fairly, have access to the same privileges, and live under a similar set of rules and values. What happens when one of her twins misbehaves while you are home with them, you just ignore it and let them get away with it until their mom comes home?!\n\nThis whole incident is perhaps just showcasing that cracks are forming in your parenting arrangement. This isn't a long term solution. Everyone in a household needs to be on the same page for the household to function well.
