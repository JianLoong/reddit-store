I wonder if couples therapy might help sort this out?", "Ah that makes sense", "NTA while your agreement was unrealistic, because how can an adult live in a house with another child and not have any authority over them, what your wife was doing was just a power play.\n\nHer waiting until you were gone to boss around your kid, and not just boss her around but insult her, is wrong. I think the real issue here is that your wife is showing you she is willing to be nasty to your kid. I think you should really have a hard look at your living arrangements and whether or not you and your wife should temporarily live separately if she's going to use proximity to your child to mistreat Sam", "NTA and WOW I love how communicative and crystal clear you are with your approaches.

But more importantly, you had an agreement, and she broke it.  It does not matter if it is something as trivial as fingernails or significant as the time of a curfew . . . you agree to parent your kids separately.\n\nI will warn you, however, that if you don't come up with similar rules and consequences for parenting kids close in age, then this will **not** be the first time you have this disagreement.  For example, what happens if you set a precedent for a high allowance that your wife feels is inappropriate for her children, but because you got to set the precedent it becomes very difficult to walk back for her children?  Another example . . . maybe your daughter can be trusted to function with a very late curfew because she is mature for her age and responsible, but your wife's daughters, when they reach the same age, cannot.   \n\nI would recommend having a private conversation with your wife to discuss your separate expectations of your children in regards to the following list below to see where you align and where you do not.  If you don't do this now, and just wait to deal with this ad-hoc, you potentially are setting yourself up for a lot of conflict:\n\n* Curfew times for different ages? Punishment if they are late?\n* Boys?  When can they date?  \n* Drinking?  Will you allow it?  Will you have a don't tell, don't ask policy?  What happens if they get caught?  What happens if they come home drunk?  Will you let them drink in front of you?\n* Driving?  What expectations do you have that they get a license besides passing the test?  Are they financially responsible for anything . . . insurance, for example?  What happens if they get a ticket?  What is the punishment?  Will they get their own cars?\n* Grades.  What are your expectations and what is the minimum acceptable academic performance?  What incentives and punishments would you use regarding their performance or lack thereof?\n* Extra-curriculars.  Will you have expectations for that . . . that they need to be involved in some, and if so, how many?\n* Jobs.  Do you expect that your kids will have a job while in high school?  If so, what types of jobs will you permit?  How many hours a week will you allow?\n* Spending money/allowances.  What does that look like for everyone?", ">She said I was accusing her of being hypocritical and trying to go behind my back\n\nShe *knew*.  \n\n>She was pissed, gave didn\u2019t speak to me, I\u2019m told  I was mildly the AH because I was disrespectful.\n\nIn what way? Asking her to explain why she had gone behind your back to do something you had both agreed you wouldn't do? Do her kids need new clothes? Because second hand or off the local FB freebie list is good enough for them, it's a *need* not a want! Are she and the kids hungry? Hope they like no name everything and expires-the-next-day deals. Is she using salon quality hair products? Not anymore! Dollar store, baby!\n\nNone of this is worth actually saying of course because the whole point is, whatever her opinion on the matter is, she *does* need to discuss it with *you*, not your daughter. If she has concerns about budget, that's reasonable to talk to you about. If she has concerns about your daughter behaving in ways you might not have witnessed, that's reasonable to talk to you about. Until you both agree \"it's time to start parenting all our children together\", only you are the person she should be talking about her concerns re your daughter. (and frankly at 15 that boat has either already sailed or likely to sail soon, and after her stunt of doing it on the sly, it's another point against you or your daughter ever being able to trust her to parent rationally and fairly.)\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI think its more likely because she tells her kids no to things, where you say yes to your daughter and thats making her life difficult, but your daughter shouldn't miss out because of that. I'm sure if she had have done something that you thought was bad, like have a attitude, not doing chores or not doing her homework, you'd have said no.\n\nMia can't change the rules of play without informing the other players, which is what she attempted to do. She IS a hypocrite and you only highlighted the fact.\n\nIf she wants to parent Sam, she needs to speak to you AND Sam about this. She's 15 and doesn't really need Mia stepping in now, because it's sounds more like a power play than actually wanting to teach her anything. If she was going to teach her the difference between needs and wants, she'd set the tone by doing her own hair...", "NTA.", "NTA and please keeps defending your daughter", "NTA at all", "NTA\n\nI don't see where your wife is coming from here. I'd definitely have a think over daughters behaviour to make sure, ensure she has healthy reactions to being told no and knowing how to budget herself because its important to set her up in life. But if there's no problems there then I'd say keep doing you in regards to parenting.\n\nAlso nailcare is something really good to get into doing yourself. It's a relaxing methodical hobby. Since I started it's been an excellent confidence boost that I wish someone had put me onto earlier. Highly reccommend it to anyone of any gender.", "Good dad.\n\nNTA. Your wife is being hypocritical, or probably envious. Either way, neither is fair to your daughter.", "You're NTA. Your wife doesn't get to violate your agreement and butt in to parent just because she disagrees with a decision you have made.", "NTA.\n\nI think you could have left the hypocrisy stuff out of it, since that's not at all the issue. Even if Mia were an absolute paragon of moral integrity, she still doesn't get to unilaterally change her relationship to your daughter without speaking to you about it first.\n\nI would restrict further conversations to that point alone. If you're parenting each other's kids now, then you need to talk about that and what it means and how it looks. If you're not parenting each other's kids now, then Mia needs to stop telling Sam what to do.\n\nSettle that issue, and then you can talk about values and morals.", "As I\u2019ve said, it is unrealistic to *you* we\u2019ve made it work for two years. And im not even sure if that\u2019s the issue here. Just because there\u2019s a child in the house means nothing, you don\u2019t have any authority or the child just because your an adult. And we have never had an instance where Sam was disrespecting mia, or acting out where mia needed to \u201cdiscipline\u201dher \n\nAnd for the second part, I\u2019m not able to say what my next move will be until I can confirm what the issue is.", "I mean if she wanted a parenting role with sam, she wouldn't have personally attacked Sam's character. That's not her being a parent that's her coming as an attacker after your kid. Maybe it's because she's personally jealous seeing your relationship with your kid, or is bent out of shape that her kids aren't getting the same thing. But it's not her being a parent", "Never seen that one before, it's kind of fun.", "Not trying to sound condescending , genuine question here. Why would she come after sams character? How does that equate to parenting? \n\nBut yeah maybe she\u2019s jealous or something, I really don\u2019t know because she won\u2019t talk to me, so I can\u2019t really confirm or deny anything.", "u/JCBashBash \n\nI don\u2019t feel like re writing this so this is how it goes", "Really? Shit fuck, did my wife tell you that? Lmfao. \n\nNo she does it amazing and is always happy with the outcomes, it might just be your family. Get over *yourself* lol", "Speaking as someone with a toxic mom.. \n\nYour daughter is probably young, vibrant, beautiful and nails are something that sparks visible joy in her life. It\u2019s odd, but happiness, youth, and beauty are things people can get competitive over and consequently jealous with. Looking in from the outside, it would appear your wife did a power play so that your daughter would be less happy and beautiful than her..", "I\u2019m going to change my vote to ESH. Because if that is how you respond to things she says, then you two deserve each other.", "If that was the case wouldn't it'd make even more sense for her to cut back on going to the salon and use that money saved from doing her own hair on her kids?", "Ugh my heart hurts ! How dare you do such a hurtful thing\ud83d\ude02 this is how I respond to strangers spitting bs then getting mad when their wrong. Lmfao but go ahead!", "Do not let your daughter suffer because your wife is jealous! Please protect your daughter."]}
