Karma comes back.", "Gonna get downvoted but NTA. I remember working my butt off in school only for myself and another person who also worked their butt off to get overlooked for awards because other people flat out lied about credentials/volunteering and no one double checked.

If you don't think that just about everyone stretches the truth on applications or resumes, you're in for a shocker in the real world.", "YWBTA it's not like they're lying about some kind of personal tragedy or oppression they've never faced or something exploitative. They're not plagiarizing anything. This is just resume buffing which is genuinely just not a big deal, especially for something that couldn't conceivably cause harm (like lying about qualifications to practice medicine or something.) It's a teenager trying to get into uni and buffing their resume with the express permission of the business owner. Is it ethically dubious? Yeah. Is it worth going nuclear over? No. In my country there is no requirement to even write personal statements to get into undergrad and personally I find the whole essay system to be pretty ridiculous anyway. Why are we putting this kind of pressure on kids to be massive overachievers? Why is it not enough to simply meet the grade cutoff? The only time I see the value in a personal statement is when someone has poor grades but would like to explain serious extenuating circumstances. It shouldn't be a base requirement. \n\nBasically, you would be causing extremely unnecessary drama over something relatively minor. Feel free to tell your sibling and dad that you think they're wrong, but trying to ruin your siblings future over this is so over the top. The real issue is a university system that makes teenagers jump through hoops with volunteer experience and extracurriculars to have any hope at a decent education. I say this as someone who works in academia. If one of my colleagues confessed to me they lied about high school volunteer experience to get into undergrad it wouldn't be the scandal you seem to think.", "Yes YWBTA.

If she lies or plagerizes in Uni and is caught she will be expelled. You are expected and required to have honor and integrity.  Creating a personal statement with lies demonstrates no integrity and she would not be considered for admission.   Your sister was doing what your father told her to do, so that was additional pressure added to the stress of applying. Stress often leads to bad decisions.

Sure people embellish on resumes and scholarship letters, but saying you did something like being a volunteer assistant manager with major responsibilities like supervising and delegating tasks is a huge lie.  \n\nI don\u2019t think you need to report your own sibling, but have a big conversation with them and your dad.

Either way, like I said, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s required but it CAN hurt someone\u2019s chances of getting in if there isn\u2019t something (one or the other).", "Thanks. You basically gave the same reply that everyone has already said and I heard you.", "It explains the concrete thinking here. Do not do this to your sister. It would be a much greater harm than what she is doing.", "I believe it's the 'accept when you're wrong' part that you have, thus far, not accepted.", "Stumbling onto personal documents isn\u2019t the same as *reading* personal documents", "Stumbling across them is not the same as picking them up and reading them.", ">and to accept when you are wrong\n\nLike you're not doing", "Stumbling across their personal documents is not a 0 chance, but everybody living together **knows** that your siblings' and parents' personal stuff like diaries or documents is off limits. The moment you saw what that document was, you should have stopped reading.\n\nConsidering that you like to bend social rules when it fits you, it's pretty funny how you are so angry about your sibling doing something similar. Admittedly, it is a different scale, but it's the same principal. So get off of your high horse and stop trying to screw your sibling and your father over.", "Stumbling, sure, reading - is a whole other thing. You didn\u2019t just glance to see what it was, you read it and took in all pertinent information. If you really don\u2019t see the difference I don\u2019t know what to tell you.", "I apologize then. I stumbled on the documents, some words caught my eye and I read them. Is that specific enough to you? It was literally printed on a sheet of paper that could have been anything.\n\nEnglish isn't my first language so that might be confusing.
