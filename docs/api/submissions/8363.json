You chatted with a friend and made a joke friends make amongst each other. It\u2019s not offensive to anyone except for maybe yourself. And it\u2019s not gross or overly sexual either.

Sounds like your friends wife is stuck up. Firstly idc about exposing a child to that type of humor because it requires a level of knowledge that requires experience with that topic, especially since you used slang. I bet this kid doesn't even know what blowing someone means. If they heard, they might have thought about you blowing out birthday candles or something like that. \n\nSecondly I guarantee he, his wife or family have said far worse in front of the child.

I think talking about such a thing to a friend is fine male or female. I don't know what kind of environments some of these people grew up in but it's clearly very sexually suppressed. Also a small comment about getting blown or blowing is pretty tame imo. It's not like you joked about blowing him. (But even then I've made joke comments to my friends about that.) I heard much worse things from music, TV, and relatives growing up. Some people can't just accept that guys and gals can be friends without reading into every interaction. I feel to be uncomfortable to this degree about that comment she must not feel very comfortable or confident in her partner and doesn't trust him. At the end of the day it's their life and if they both tell you to back down do so, guess you just can't be as close and confined as much as you used to.", "INFO:  How many friends do you facetime on a regular basis?

If I'd known he was taking your calls in private I would have ruled differently.  Have updated my judgment.  He's the problem here, not you.", "I think she may see this as being secretive when it's absolutely not (at least on your part).\n\nAlso, I believe her problem may be with him not you, but she doesn't want to express that and you are the Scapegoat. He laughed that's fine, but he also could have said something after like \"my kid is here\" and keep it moving, when she blew up and he defended you to her it may seem like he thinks this is okay to happen. You apologized, you are not in the wrong, especially since you didn't even know the kid was in the room. Your friend was just in \"friend\" mode not in \"parent\" mode when his kid was around and that can lead to trouble.\n\nIf he is usually going somewhere private when you talk this may exacerbate her jealousy and him being friends with his ex may also be hard. She may see it as him going to his room alone facetiming with another woman, which can be hard and something a lot of people wouldn't be okay with. If he does this with your other friend too (his ex) it could be even harder.\n\nI am in no way defending her because I think she is dealing with this wrongly and should talk it out like adults. I am just trying to understand her pov because this doesn't seem like a blow up that happens after a one time thing. They could try counseling.", "This from another comment from OP to me:\n\n>**Mark always goes to their room when we chat so it's more private.**\n\nOP may be innocent, but Mark is not.  There is absolutely no reason for a spouse to leave the room to have more \"privacy\" with a friend.  \n\nLet me take that back.  OP can NOT be this clueless.  She knows that this \"friendship\" is a point of contention between Mark and his wife.  If she respected Mark's marriage at all she would not facetime him while he hides from his wife and son, probably laying on the marriage bed."]}
