When she found out she also wished my baby was never born and that I should get rid as well as saying I was trapping her son. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and things got worse she kicked me out with no place to go, and on the occasional times I would stay to see my partner she would demand rent from me.She also threatened me for taking my partner out for a birthday meal. By this point me and my MIL had no contact. \n\nIn July 22 me and my partner made the decision to move 60 miles away to be closer to my family for support and we overall thought the area was nicer to raise a baby. Of course the MIL had things to say about this and didn\u2019t like it and phoned my partner screaming all kinds of abuse towards me. \n\nIn December 22 we welcomed our little boy. He was a healthy boy. This is where people think I might have been a arsehole.  My MIL has never bothered with our son never asked how he was or even could be bothered to learn his name so I\u2019ve never forced him to get to know her. I don\u2019t see why I should have to force a relationship that she clearly doesn\u2019t want, my son is not missing out he has grandparents who love him and make a effort with him, as well as a big family.  \n\nLittle information my son is now 6 months and has suffered allergies and reflux and the MIL is now only complaining that she doesn\u2019t know him but still wishes he was not born. \n\nIn recent days MIL has phoned my now husband to complain that she is a stranger to my child and puts all the blame on me so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she got pregnant, (planned or not) it would *immensly* impact our daily lives. I honestly do not think adding a baby would be good for our family. Think about the crying, being woken at nights, the impact on routines, my other child being affected doing his studies, and the attention the child would naturally seek. Call me selfish, but I'd worry if we could all adjust without getting on eachother's nerves because of lack of sleep. \n So it is honestly not something **I** would choose. And to be blunt, they are living in our home, so I feel we have a say at who lives here. I mean, they know we wouldn't even allow them to get a pet, while that would have less of an impact than a baby. \n\nIF however, they were able to find a house of their own, and then she got pregnant, I'd be more than happy for her, be a proud grandma, and would LOVE helping out and babysitting. \n\nAgain, the way your MIL talked is *unacceptable* and has no excuse.", "Your MIL is a controlling, abusive woman who could never offer real love to your child.
