I looked at my partner and he didn\u2019t really give an answer. \n\nIt made me really uncomfortable.. So I said \u201cI gues I can pay for a waffle for you guys\u2026?\u201d I ended up paying \u20ac20 for waffles for the both of them..\n\nI understand that I\u2019ve offered to buy them something and that\u2019s totally on me but it did ruin my evening.

Friend also NEVER asked you to pay for anything for them.  You offered to buy the waffles after they told you they didn't want anything.  Whatever reason they did not bring any money is none of your business.  The only reason you were put out was completely of your making.  Don't blame them for eating food they never asked you to buy for them that you bought anyway.", "Nta. They are both grown ass adult, natural you expects them to pay for themselves.", "NTA, but I think you should take this as a little lesson; keep an eye on who sets up things like this while actually expecting you or someone else to pay. \n\nIf you can take your friend at his word, you didn't have to buy anything for him. He'll be fine with that. If he is only *saying* that while secretly relying on you to offer to buy him something it will come out as a pattern of behavior, or in his reaction if you take him at his word and don't buy him anything. Same with your boyfriend saying nothing -- actually, he seems more likely to have been expecting you to offer, as he didn't say one way or the other leaving it open for you to assume he needs you to pay for him without him having to actually ask.", "NTA  But you also shouldn't have offered to buy them anything.", "YTA don\u2019t offer to pay for something and then resent it.  Be responsible for your choices - if someone comes to a Christmas market with no money, I guess they would just like to look around and have zero intention of buying anything.

And why du pay for your bf as well? Sounds like u had a problem asserting yourself", "No assholes just inconsiderate people. \n\nThey should have brought money to a market. \n\nYou offered to buy them waffles so however that makes you feel inside is all on you alone.

You feeling off about it is on you.", "NAH\n\nSometime folks just want to check out something Christmasy without any intention of buying anything. I can see this for a small school Christmas setup. And no one asked you to buy extra food. \n\nYour friend explicitly said \u201cI don\u2019t want anything\u201d, so there shouldn\u2019t be any awkwardness towards him as he clearly wasn\u2019t expecting you to buy him. Any ill feelings towards him is on you.\n\nYour partner is a bit different, but that\u2019s a couple\u2019s dynamic so I\u2019ll let you decide is his actions were ok. If it still bothers you, ask your cheap-ass bf to Venmo you \u20ac10.\n\nThat said, I absolutely would\u2019ve bought the extra food too - especially since it\u2019s for a small school.

You asked your friend if they were going to get anything and they said no. You could have left it there.

It would have been fine if you just bought waffles for yourself.", "Your friend said he didn't have money. I don't see where he or your partner comes into it at all.\n\nI'm gonna buck the trend and say NAH. They didn't ask for your generosity so we don't get to judge them the AH just because you felt uncomfortable enough to offer your own money to cover them.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like one of those 'sorry I left my wallet in my other coat' moments.  I don't believe they went out without having any money with them.  They just didn't want to pay for anything.", "You made them share the waffle? How barbaric!", "Not the asshole.\n\nPuzzling behavior from the men. I never go outside without my wallet, truly a bizarre display.", "NTA. You were going to a market, which implies buying things, and your friend didn\u2019t bring any money. They should have brought some money in case of an emergency. My take is, they got what they wanted: they got you to buy them something out of sheer awkwardness. And, yes, you should expect 2 grown men to pay for themselves and to be responsible enough to bring money with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Those people should be embarrassed that they are not responsible enough to take care of themselves. Geez. \n\nIf you invite them in the future, please be sure to remind them to bring their wallets as you don't have extra funds (for freeloaders, but you don't have to say that part out loud).\n\nThat would have put a damper on my evening, for sure!", "NTA.

Hardly surprising they didn\u2019t expect you to spend $$.", "It is off. Moochy friends is a grown adult who brings no money than eats up when you feel uncomfortable eating in front of him. And invited themselves.", "...what feels off about it? You unilaterally decided to do something nice, and then they accepted your out of the blue nice decision.", "That was rude. Grown adults carry a form of payment even if not originally wanting a purchase. And ESPECIALLY if food may be involved. Window shopping is not the same as being a moocher.", "She only decided after broke friends stated they didn't bring money.", "He literally said he didn't want anything.
