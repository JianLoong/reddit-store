It bothered me a lot at first so I would always wear wigs to hide my baldness. Since about a year I've kind of come to accept it, and now I even think I can look pretty cute even without wearing a wig, so I started wearings wigs less and less, and since about three months ago I stopped wearing them completely.\n\nNow my older sister (24F) is getting married in a few weeks, and she asked me if I would wear a wig to her wedding. I said I wouldn't, and she asked me again to do it for her, because it's just a small effort on my part. I refused again because I finally got comfortable with my appearance, and I don't want to hide it anymore. She told me I'm being unreasonable because it's such a small thing to do for her wedding day and walked off. Now my parents are also trying to convince me to just do this one little thing for my sister on her special day to make her happy, but it feels like everyone is just trying to hide that I'm bald.\n\nI'd understand her point if I had never gone anywhere without a wig before and this would be the first time everyone saw me without a wig, but everyone has already seen me without a wig. Everyone already knows I'm bald, so there wouldn't be any attention stealing.\n\nAITA for refusing to honour my sister's request about wearing a wig?", "created_utc": 1704363820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18y9y49/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_wig_to_my_sisters/", "score": 999, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It bothered me a lot at first so I would always wear wigs to hide my baldness. Since about a year I've kind of come to accept it, and now I even think I can look pretty cute even without wearing a wig, so I started wearings wigs less and less, and since about three months ago I stopped wearing them completely.\n\nNow my older sister (24F) is getting married in a few weeks, and she asked me if I would wear a wig to her wedding. I said I wouldn't, and she asked me again to do it for her, because it's just a small effort on my part. I refused again because I finally got comfortable with my appearance, and I don't want to hide it anymore. She told me I'm being unreasonable because it's such a small thing to do for her wedding day and walked off. Now my parents are also trying to convince me to just do this one little thing for my sister on her special day to make her happy, but it feels like everyone is just trying to hide that I'm bald.\n\nI'd understand her point if I had never gone anywhere without a wig before and this would be the first time everyone saw me without a wig, but everyone has already seen me without a wig.

The OP in that post was a  size 12 and the dress didn't come in that size and all the other Bridesmaids were smaller so their friend asked them to step down as a bridesmaid for that reason rather than just picking another dress or letting them wear something else. I am a plus sized person myself and I  remember telling a friend about the story and how I couldn\u2019t  believe someone would choose a dress over their dear friend and she actually agreed with the bride. There were other things in our friendship but her agreement with that told me a lot about how she truly was as a person and friend on the inside. I really only talk to her if I need to now as we are in the same volunteer group.", "When everything is about aestetic why don't they just go to a modeling agency and hire their guests? Ah, oh yes, that would be expensive and nobody will bring a gift. So better guilt trip and manipulate friends and family into your picture perfect fairytale world.", "I've been in more weddings than I ever cared to be in and not once did the bride, groom, or anyone ever make me feel like I wasn't fitting into their picture of aesthetic or have crazy demands. I truly don't understand some brides being so outrageously demanding.\n\nWhen I got married, I rounded up all the girls and we went dress shopping. I let them all pick the dress together with my vague guideline of a deeper purple. Hair? Didn't care. Makeup? Didn't care. Shoes? Didn't care. Wanted to change for the reception? Didn't care. I was just stoked to have people I love up there to celebrate with me.", "I did this too! My only request for my bridesmaids was that their dress be blue and semiformal. That was it. We had fun raiding closets to see what we already had or going shopping for little things. There was zero pressure on it and the entire affair was lowkey. We had more fun dancing and just enjoying company than getting into aesthetics", "I had niece with purple hair when I got married. She asked me if I wanted her to change her hair back to a natural color. I said nope, I love you as you are and I want you to be you.", "Totally agree.", "True, I lost my hair due to radiotherapy and even though I have got a collection of wigs, I rarely wear them. It\u2019s not comfortable at all, especially for a full day occasion like a wedding. I always get headaches just after 1 hour", "Context matters here\u2026. The poster isn\u2019t saying that as a general statement. \n\nOP has started to accept that they aren\u2019t defined by their hair loss. \n\nBut their sister is trying to define them by their hair loss\u2026 \n\nWithin context\u2026 being bald IS part of who that person is, and their sister should accept them as they are.", "I totally get where you're coming from, and we all handle our medical things in the best way for us.\n\nI am profoundly Deaf. I'm 52 and spent years trying to fit in and not be seen as Deaf - it's got worse & worse over the years. Only 18 months ago, I discovered the Deaf Community quite by chance. Since then, I've completely embraced being Deaf, it's now a massive part of who I am and I'm actually proud to be Deaf and to be learning BSL. I wish I'd discovered, or allowed myself to discover, all this years ago.\n\nI'm totally not being unkind here at all - it's just interesting to see how people do things. I agree with you, I wouldn't want to be known just for being Deaf, but I actually love having it as a part of me, now \ud83d\ude0a", "I have bright pink hair. It's a reflection of my eccentricity and confidence. \nI think the comment was more aimed at her confidence to be openly bald. Not everyone has it. I don't know if I would and I'm confident. \nCompletely get why a medical condition should never define you as I have several and some are visable. I ensure I'm never defined by them just as I'm sure you do.", "It\u2019s not that her being bald is what she\u2019s solely defined by, it\u2019s that it\u2019s part of the whole sum that is her. The same  way having brown hair or freckles or an accent would contribute to the whole of someone\u2019s being.", "Hi! The OP *is* chosing to embrace it, which makes a difference, I think.\n\nYour hair or lack thereof doesn't define you. But I wasn't talking about external definitions, I was referencing the experiences that build a person. Your experience with alopecia and all that comes with it is part of your story, right? \n\nEvery aspect of us - both current and present - had a hand in making us who we are today. Even the shit we wish wasn't there, that wasn't part of the story. Even the unhappy shit. If you love someone as they are today, you love - or at least accept - all the bits that built them that way. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is: how different would your character be if you didn't have alopecia? Would you be the same person? How did your experience having alopecia in our society contribute to how you approach the world and what you bring to the table as a human? \n\nThose aren't questions that need answering on the internet. And none of that is to say we should be aggressively positive about things, aggressively love every part of us or others, or shouldn't change things about our body that we have control over if that's what we want to do. It doesn't give terrible actions a pass. It's just that we're all products of our experiences and all that goes into it.", "The thing about that is it's your choice to do whatever you want with your body \n\nIf you want to dye your hair or shave it whether by choice or that's what life gave you nobody should nor can judge you", "Ugh good catch. I basically live in this sub and the various wedding subs and there are entirety too many questions along those lines, must have blurred them together pre coffee.", "Yea it makes me so angry every time I think about it.", "My friends who lost their hair during chemo by far preferred wearing scarves to wigs. Unless you\u2019re willing to spend a lot of money, wigs are itchy and hot.", "Wigs generally are less uncomfortable when you have hair under there, for bald people they are even more scratchy and hot! You *can* get very nice wigs at affordable prices if you know a lot about wigs, treat the fibres, and style them well - but it is a lot of effort. I enjoy styling wigs but it's an absurd amount of work to force on someone. Add to that the physical discomfort for the entire wedding and OP's sister comes off very extreme here", "I would want mermaid hair!", "I came here to suggest clown wig too. The cheapest OP can find on eBay or wish.", "How can people be so inhumane?", "Or a mohawk that's at least 6\" high and has the colours of the rainbow dyed into it as well LOL.", "Oh I like how you think!", "\"How they appear\" what a wild statement. A broad dress code is one thing. Formal, semi-formal etc. But this level of control is just a power trip. If something like this is enough to \"ruin\" the wedding they are not mature enough to get married", "Sister didn't say it was unacceptable but just asked if she could wear a wig. As OP has done for 6 years. I'm not saying OP has to wear a wig, neighter that her sister should command her to wear one. Just saying if OP sister has called OP's appearance unacceptable than it would be a massive big TA on OP's sisters side.\n\nAnd I disagree, it would not look more attention grabbing. Because it would be in the first pictures, the first thing you see - the bride and the groom. And then on the second look you would notice this or if looking at all of the pictures. And there the first moment of 'wow the bride looks so amazing and is the center of this photos' is over and then it can go to 'yes, this is my sister. Told you she got bald at a young age' ...", "And I disagree \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I think you\u2019re oversimplifying", "Crazy anime styled cosplay wigs, definitely", "Tell that to my mother-in-law...", "The OP should wear a wig - a big, loud, bright-colored wig.

How insecure must those brides be?! I\u2019ve only just realised one of my bridesmaids was 6ft tall, while I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d. Never even crossed my mind to be bothered about it.", "That\u2019s wild. I eloped but when I was still planning a wedding my brides would\u2019ve been from 4\u201911.5\u201d to 6\u2019. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d. I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.", "I bet it was a short groom that was uncomfortable.", "Good on you! When you concentrate on having fun and creating good memories, then that's what you get - and it's a really enjoyable day and memory for all involved. Everyone's always so miserable at these Instagram weddings because they're not comfortable and they're putting on appearances. Sure, the photos are nice, but nobody looks back fondly and thinks about the day and the fun they had. By comparison, I bet you have great memories of the time spent with your bridesmaids before the big day, and the relaxed, happy atmosphere of the day itself.\n\nI'll never understand why people spend thousands and thousands, and ruin friendships and relationships, all for \"picture perfect\" photos that they'll never look at again (other than the obligatory one on the wall). We decided that anything we were spending out, we were enjoying! Best way, I reckon :)", "The fact that she asked shows that she respects you - and your reply shows that respect was earned. A beautiful answer and a lovely way to emphasise how important your niece is to you :)", "It\u2019s a fair assumption. I\u2019m guessing the sister wants her to wear a wig even as a guest, so she receives less attention and probably for the aesthetic of the family photos. Both ways it\u2019s a crappy request, especially since this not a new or unknown appearance for OP", "Expensive ones are still hot. Well the ones I\u2019ve experienced are", "No way to get around them being hot. It\u2019s a lot of material, synthetic or real, being anchored on a cap stuck to your head. They can be made better so they are less hot but not completely. The degree of heat also depends on how much hair you want the wig to have.", "I have a friend with alopecia. Sometimes she wears a wig but it makes her head itchy. She sometimes gets henna tattoo for special occasions and it looks so pretty", "She didn't say unacceptable, but demanding OP changes her appearance, and roping in the mother to demand the same very obviously means they don't want OP to appear in her normal state. That indicates they find her baldness unacceptable. It's selfish, demeaning and cruel to OP, even if they are trying to parse it as 'please do it for me.'", "Malicious compliance.

She dieted and tried to lose weight, but didn't have a lot of success, and the bride actually kicked her out of the wedding party. Brides can be VICIOUS. I worked in beauty for 18 years, I've had some wild wedding stories.", "One of my bridesmaids was 5\u20192 and the other was 6\u20192. They are my nearest and dearest. It never crossed my mind to pick bridesmaids that fit a certain \u201clook\u201d and I thought both looked amazing (even found matching dresses that both looked amazing in even though the original plan was same color, different style to account for their very different heights.  But when trying on dresses they both liked the same dress the best so it all worked out).", "I think you are correct.", "Yessss", "I\u2019m the same, even the kids in my family are taller, sucks always being put at the front of family pictures \ud83d\ude02", "My best friend said it would throw off the balance of the photos as the bride and groom were both 5\u20194 and I\u2019d look like the jolly green giant!
