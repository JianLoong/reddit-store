Their son (m2) opened the door and ran around the yard for a bit while we talked. When we were done they both went inside and left their son outside. I yelled for him that it was time to go inside and he yelled back \"no, shut up\" and continued to run around. I opened the door and stepped inside and saw my sister in law talking with her father so I said \"eh (insert sister in laws name) come get yo son\". Her father responded with \"I'm talking to my daughter\" very aggressively. I didn't say anything back but just went back outside to make sure the 2 year old didn't get hurt. About 10 minutes go by when nephew says he's ready to go inside so we do. Sister in laws father tried to say something else to me but I cut him off and said \"Her children are not my responsibility, the next time I'll just come inside and it'll be your fault if he gets hurt since talking with your daughter is more important than her being a mother\".   (I would never leave my nephew outside alone by the way). He called me a jerk (Mormons don't cuss) and said its a good thing you are unable to have children. \n\nI left for work shorlty after the incident but I can't help but think that maybe IATA.

As a 11 year old kid and youngest amongst my cousins.  I had gone to one of my oldest cousins house for a house warming party and her older brother was there with his 2year old daughter.  Nobody was paying attention to this kid.  Due to the age gap and my social anxiety I stayed near my parents. Also too young for drinking anything outside soda. At one point I see the little kid waddling towards the edge of the yard.  I bolted out of my chair and grabbed her so fast.  Might sound like a crazy response until I explain it.  The edge of the yard was a 25 foot drop at minimum off a steep cliff.  My cousin didn\u2019t have a fence around her property and so one wrong move and you would fall down.  Dangerous for drunk adults who could at least understand not to go there before being drunk. No way in hell a 2 year old is going to know better.  After that incident I became a Helicopter cousin too afraid to let any younger kids out of my sight at parties.  That was 25+years ago and now the torch was passed on to someone else who picked that up.", "This sounds like a \u201cMess around and find out\u201d moment for the parents if they just treat people willing to deal with their kids like that.", "Her brother left him out there, too...", "I don't know, I thought I was being too harsh.
