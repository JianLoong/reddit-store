Clearly he wanted you to subsidise his meal, which is why he ordered so many expensive dishes and he got upset when you wouldn't meekly oblige.", "NTA\n\nThat's not a true friend. In my experience me and my friends usually do the thing where I pay for this and they pay for the next, and vice versa. It doesn't sound like you guys do that. It's not fair to ask you to pay for that kind of stuff.\n\nI would re-evaluate the friendship. How often do you pay for their stuff? Not just food, but like a quick thing at target or whatever store. How often do they forget their wallet? Etc.", "NTA. Your friend was definitely taking advantage. There\u2019s nothing wrong with treating someone; I was taught that when someone does treat you, you are suppose to order how you usually order and your friend did not do this, they were looking for a expensive meal at your expense.", "Info: did you invite him out and state it was your treat?

If you go out to dinner with your friend again, mention that the checks will be separate to the server right away.", "NTA Your friend needs to grow up. It's perfectly reasonable to want to pay for only  your own portion of the bill. The fact that he threw a hiddy fit over it tells me he was trying to take advantage of you.", "NTA - He was definitely trying to take advantage, otherwise he would not have thrown a hissy fit.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your friend was taking advantage of you.  Any reasonable person would be fully prepared to pay for 100% of what they eat/drink.  An offer to \"split 50/50\" should never be taken for granted.\n\nEven when I go out with friends I've known for more than 20 years, sometimes we split evenly, sometimes we itemise, depending on the circumstances.  We all know when some of us have gone overboard on food (or more likely, drink) and others are driving and have an early start, and that asking the teetotalers to subsidise the alcoholics is just unfair.  And sometimes we all share food and drink and everyone has a good time and we all throw in an equal amount because it's not worth it to count how many glasses of wine each of us had from the half-dozen bottles we consumed.", "NTA\nDetermine if it's split, covered fully, or pay for your own upon accepting any invite. Where I come from 1 person pays everything.  I do realize other areas have different rules that vary.", "Sometimes, I go out with friends and we share a few dishes. In these cases it's easiest to just split the cost of food evenly, but we still pay for our own drinks (some of us enjoy alcohol & others don't).", "If its relatively even, it can just be easier", "We both had the day off so we went to the park. After we had just finished a couple of pickup basketball games at the park, I asked him if he wanted to go eat later, we ultimately chose that restaurant for later. we also decided to split the bill beforehand", "We did have the same menu but I hadn\u2019t seen the price of the items he\u2019d ordered until after i got the bill. His options were way more pricey than what I had gotten", "I mentioned it and he wanted to go", "So he kinda invited himself? Huge rude flag.", "How? At the beginning of the meal, you just tell the server that you are on separate tickets.", "Ooh. Okay. I was trying to work out the liar part. He tried to scam you. NTA.", "I mean not really, that's how a lot of plans start. Someone mentions a place that seems good and you say \"ohhh I'd be keen!\"  \n\n\nBut friend is a huge AH. The fact he threw a tantrum when you said I'll just pay for my own shows he was only ordering the stuff he ordered as he thought it would be partially subsidised.", "Bill comes, put down two cards, tell the server youre splitting it. \n\nNo math involved. Ta-dah.", "NTA.  I don't think you're an asshole, but I do kind of get his point IF you normally split evenly when you go out.  It would be one thing if before the dinner ever happened, you'd mentioned wanting to split by food and not evenly because of your budget.  But you waited until the bill came in, looked at it, and then wanted to change things up.  The whole point of splitting the bill evenly is that even if someone pays a little more one time, it'll even out the next time you go.  I can understand from his POV it kind of looked like you might be saying 'well I'm willing to split as long as I get a benefit out of it, but if you are, no way'.  I'm not saying you are doing this, but if things changed abruptly from the way it's been running for a while, it looks sus.  \n\nAll that being said, he should have handled it better than throwing a hissy fit and getting the attention of surrounding tables.  There's always a way to have adult conversation about this, and he didn't meet that pretty basic criteria in handling the situation.  In the future maybe just make clear the expectation that people pay for what they eat and DONT switch it up.", "NTA, I am a firm believer in if you order it you pay for it.", "I feel bad for the server who probably got no tip.", "NTA. He was taking advantage. Although I\u2019m a little surprised that you were surprised by the bill. Weren\u2019t you sitting there as he ordered?", "NTA but try to always figure out how you\u2019re going to divide the bill before ordering at a restaurant.", "I had former friends like this,  People like this plan on others kindness to mooch off of them.  \n\nThis happens more often that you realize. I consider people like these as leeches, or grifters.\n\nIn the future, before you go out with others, state that you want to take care of you bill only .  I may come off as harsh, but explain when you tell  others that this event happened.  Most people understand, once they hear.\n\nNTA", "Your friend having the hissy fit means he was ABSOLUTELY trying to take advantage of you, so good for you for standing up for yourself. \n\nNTA in the slightest.", "I'd just say \"most all the bill is yours you might as well pay it and I will leave the tip.\"", "NTA. \n\nI like to order like your friend, and that\u2019s why I pay the entire bill every single time. I don\u2019t want someone to stress over whether I expect half, I don\u2019t want to do the math to figure out an equitable split.", "It\u2019s unclear that you invited them out and offered to pay. If you did, your friend is AH but you are a liar.", "NTA. Your friend is taking advantage. Always get separate checks", "NTA. He\u2019s also not a real friend.", "Your \u201cfriend\u201d knew exactly what they were doing. OP NTA and I suggest you throw this friend into the dumpster or return them at the nearest customer service counter", "So...you get that your friend deliberately tried to take advantage of you yeah?\n\nIf that wasn't his plan, he wouldn't be upset at paying his own bill.", " Nta. Anytime i went out to dinner with friends, we paid for our own meals and drinks and only split any appies that we shared.", "I loved how a restaurant I went to recently handles it beforehand.\n\nWaitress asked us how the checks were being split upfront and typed our orders into the tablet. We paid via the tablet at the end. None of that well split it at the end bullshit.", "I never have understood this either.", "I do it with friends.  We often split an appetizer or two.  Being older, and not AHs this is not a big thing other than making sure we reciprocate, when one couple is very quick with picking up the check.\n\nThe ability to do this is the ability you trust you friends not to take advantage.  You want to have a nice evening out.\n\nIf I order the $$ special, this is the time for me to pick up the check.  If somehow others won't let me, I ask to pay the bar tab.", "Simplicity. I honestly don't care if I'd have to pay a bit more or a bit less. It's just easier to split 60 usd three ways instead of calculating 'oh you had this and I had that and who had the dark beer?

Some of the nicest kindest people I have ever met.  Keeping up with them can be a challenge because so are so quick with paying.  \n\nIt is nice when you can do this with people you trust.

How were you surprised when the bill came?", "I\u2019m a bit surprised that you guys agreed to split the bill evenly beforehand. How did that come about? I feel like in most situations where people end up splitting evenly, it\u2019s rarely spoken about beforehand, it\u2019s just assumed after the bill arrives (or someone takes charge and decides to divide it evenly). I\u2019ve only seen it discussed beforehand in group situations (like a birthday dinner), then someone might ask.", "Read the IF", "Yeah. My rule is first time they take advantage of common decency at a restaurant I refuse another meal with them.\n\nFor example one person the wife and I invited out to for a birthday or something,  should up with another person.

The will give you the bill and a calculator, though.", "Appetizers and desserts may be shared. Some places can split the cost, some don\u2019t. Some people may eat more of one than the other.
