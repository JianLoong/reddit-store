But you waited until the bill came in, looked at it, and then wanted to change things up.  The whole point of splitting the bill evenly is that even if someone pays a little more one time, it'll even out the next time you go.  I can understand from his POV it kind of looked like you might be saying 'well I'm willing to split as long as I get a benefit out of it, but if you are, no way'.
