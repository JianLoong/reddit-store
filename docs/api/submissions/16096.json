But you waited until the bill came in, looked at it, and then wanted to change things up.  The whole point of splitting the bill evenly is that even if someone pays a little more one time, it'll even out the next time you go.  I can understand from his POV it kind of looked like you might be saying 'well I'm willing to split as long as I get a benefit out of it, but if you are, no way'.

Our friends ordered a quesadilla for their toddler, but the toddler and her mom didn\u2019t drink, but the husband did. \n\nI can\u2019t see how it would be simple at all to divide that order among 5 couples and keep track of exactly who had which entrees/tacos, how many, who had guac but not salad, which couples had both partners drinking and which had only one, etc.", "Exactly my point.  You *can't* just split things easily if everyone is sharing, or if the various different dishes range in price a lot.\n\nIt obviously depends on the group and who tends to order what.

I think it\u2019s funny the only time me (or most of my friends) absolutely insist on paying for exactly what we ordered is when I spend a disproportionally large amount on the bill. I wouldn\u2019t want my friend to foot the bill if I chose an expensive entree or had a few drinks when they only had water. I think this shows the type of person you are.", "It is so bizarre to me that anyone would assume otherwise. Splitting must be agreed to by everyone.

I have two friends that I will dine out with on a fairly frequent basis (separately, not at the same time).  In general, we spend close to the same amount and we make about the same amount so splitting it in half is a \"no harm/no foul and we don't have to think about it\".\n\nIf we go out for sushi then we don't want to do the \"well, I had two pieces of this roll, and split that roll evenly, and I wanted two types of nigiri and I shared that one but not the other, and I you shared this with me, and I had three servings of saki from the first flask and only two on the second\".

I realize I'm lucky like that.", "Lucky me.  I know neither any vegan teetotalers nor steak loving wine snobs.  Just congenial people who are good company and not mooches.  As for me?  I know I'm not a mooch and they seem to find me good company so I'm content.", "My friends aren't mooches and are trustworthy and generous, but they like to drink, and drink expensive wine. It's not uncommon for me to have one cocktail at $13, and for my friend to have a bottle of wine at $60 plus another glass. Friend's alcohol bill is frequently in the $80-$100 range compared to my maybe $20, and right now I'm pregnant so my drinks bill is usually nothing. Our food might cost similarly, but I can't subsidize her drinking like that. \n\nHowever, we rarely go to places like sushi or tapas, where we'd be sharing items. She's a celiacs and I have a shellfish allergy, so we tend to keep food separate so we don't cross contaminate each other's food. \n\nEven in restaurants where I say \"Oh just down the middle\" the server usually just takes the bills away and splits them by seat. It's second nature for servers here.", "Perhaps it's a cultural thing.  I live in Australia."]}
