Your wife is the one who needs an apology from SIL.\nEdit: those are awful things to say to anyone, but I feel its particularly cruel to say to someone who's just had a baby.

If SIL was trying to help your wife feel confident as a new mother, telling her she isn't 'mummy material' is certainly a strange way to do it. \n\nDo not apologize.

Rather like a cat in a home with a new baby or a new pet might start bringing in dead animals to remind everyone that they are a mighty hunter needing attention and respect.\n\nThe difference is that a cat\u2019s brain is about the size of a walnut; and your SIL might well be expected to have human rather than feline social skills - there was no call for her to be so catty.", "You are NTA and owe no apology.

Makeup would make the situation far worse, not better.\n\nAs for putting some on *after* the birth - F that Shit.", "I'm 7 weeks away from giving birth and putting effort into my appearance for labour and delivery is not even on my list of things to give a fuck about. All I care about is that both me and my baby are healthy and safe. Birth isn't meant to be a beauty pageant. It's full of blood, shit and bodily fluids. None of that is pretty lol.", "Also, keep Lisa far away from Sofia because new baby days of no sleep, breast feeding or settling etc have plenty of opportunities for ignorant judgement that can crush a new mum.", ">Lisa wasn\u2019t just insulting, she sounds absolutely unhinged. \n\nThis \\^  Mom and baby were both alive after the delivery - that's the best look you can possibly hope for.\n\nThe idea of putting make up on before delivery to \"look good\" just goes to show how little she actually knows about childbirth.  A couple of hours of pushing, screaming and medical staff staring at your hoo-ha isn't going to preserve make-up.  Giant mascara streaks down your face aren't going to be any more photogenic than a bare face.", "Someone without children.", "My mom doesn't even know what half the stuff in the makeup aisle does", "If my mom wears anything more than mascara and powder she doesn't even look like my mom.", "I convinced my mom to stop wearing make up because she is far prettier without it. I wouldn't recognize her with make up on now.", "I think it's a cultural difference. I've heard British people say, \"Mexican wave,\" but I've generally heard Americans say, \"the wave.\"", "That\u2019s a terrible idea.", "\"Oh, honey. <sympathetic look> How sad and inadequate you must feel to have felt the need to insult a total stranger to make yourself feel better. I do hope you are able to find your way to some genuine self confidence. I will be praying for you.\"\n\nFwiw, I don't pray. I'm an atheist. I've just always thought that was some fucked up, condescending shit to say to someone. Might as well weaponize it for good.", "I had someone at a store say, \u201cwow, you just look comfy today.\u201d And I still don\u2019t know how to feel about that. It was several years ago", "Jesus what is wrong with people??", "let's bring back the old school term: **Grifters**", "Influencers tend to influence me to stay the hell away from whatever they are promoting, just on principle.", "This is a bot that stole this comment from u/whatitdobeebee", "True, they are a detriment to society.  Lisa is extremely toxic.", "Same with my mom and my grandma.\n\nI\u2019m not a mom but I know less about makeup than them", "Good one!  Are you a Southerner, by any chance? Because that's the kind of poisoned honey we love to pour all over folks that piss us off.  LMAO.\n\nLike a Southerner's favorite mortal insult is: \"Bless your heart, darlin'\"", "It\u2019s definitely more accurate. Influencers make it sound like there\u2019s actually contribution and people like Lisa are not only not contributing, they\u2019re actually making things worse by making money the way that they do.", "Oh god I feel sick to my stomach bc you're probably right. She's going to be trying to do that baby's makeup by the time she's a year old.", "Gotta get those eyebrows waxed, and put on false eyelashes!\n\n(says a mum who can't stand teens who wear eyelashes so long they could be used as brooms.  Thank goodness my sixteen year old daughter doesn't wear them)"]}
