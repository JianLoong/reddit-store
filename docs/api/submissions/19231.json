Your wife is the one who needs an apology from SIL.\nEdit: those are awful things to say to anyone, but I feel its particularly cruel to say to someone who's just had a baby.

If SIL was trying to help your wife feel confident as a new mother, telling her she isn't 'mummy material' is certainly a strange way to do it. \n\nDo not apologize.

Rather like a cat in a home with a new baby or a new pet might start bringing in dead animals to remind everyone that they are a mighty hunter needing attention and respect.\n\nThe difference is that a cat\u2019s brain is about the size of a walnut; and your SIL might well be expected to have human rather than feline social skills - there was no call for her to be so catty.", "You are NTA and owe no apology.

Shit, had I seen this in person, I would have given you a standing ovation. Also, she didn't give a real apology she gave something that she thought would pass for an apology.
