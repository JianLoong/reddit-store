But I can see why your brother and SIL are devastated. Hope you're both able to make amends. Just a very unfortunate situation all around. I do think you could have a little more sympathy for them. Their kid is dead, ffs.", "NAH, I'm Hindu, and I know how important the ceremony is. You actually broke tradition to tell them. It was a sad coincidence, and I feel for your brother's loss.", "NTA.\n\nLet me explain the context folks.\n\nIn India, children are named after they are born. Typically anywhere between 2-3 months after. I know someone who didn\u2019t name their kid for 1.5 years! This is normal. Unlike the west we do not HAVE TO put a name on the birth certificate the minute a baby is born. What suffices is - Baby of Mother\u2019s Name (and yes it\u2019s only mother\u2019s name). \n\nIn Hindu culture, there is a pooja (a ritual around the fire) that is held anytime after 40 days (but can even be held a year later) depending on what suits the family, where there is a naming ceremony. Before this ceremony, the couple decided the name between themselves and then reveal the name at the ceremony. \n\nOP\u2019s brother\u2019s kid must\u2019ve passed before they got to the naming ceremony. So OP didn\u2019t know the name. Now him and his wife presumably labored over the choosing of a name for a long long time and came up with a name they liked. They now are surrounded by friends and family and are about to formally announce the name.\n\nA few minutes before that, someone comes and says that by coincidence this name happens to be one that was chosen but never revealed. It would be impossible to change the name last minute. I mean husband-wife would have to revisit their list, discuss, vote, finalise, etc a new name - all in a matter of minutes.\n\nYou also can\u2019t say to everyone - we\u2019ll go ahead with the Pooja but there\u2019s no name that we will reveal today. That would be absurd. The whole point of the ceremony is to name the baby and formally welcome the baby to the family. \n\nI think Atishay knowing all this is behaving super entitled. He doesn\u2019t own a name. Even one with an unknowable tragedy attached to it. He should just be happy that they will have a Kartika in the family and move on.\n\nOP you are NTA.", "I have known a few women of Indian origin named Karthika so I don\u2019t think this is an uncommon name.  Your brother and SIL knew you had a daughter.  They had plenty of time to warn you about choosing this name.  NTA", "NTA \n\nPeople should really take time to really read posts. Your wife got pregnant after your niece passed away. By my reckoning this means your brother had about 9 months to drop a hint even please don\u2019t use this name if it\u2019s a girl.\n\nHe didn\u2019t he left it till you had picked a name to attack. Do I feel sorry for your brother and his wife yes. Would you have been ta if you did know for months and chose the name yes. However your brother didn\u2019t tell you till the last minute so nope NTA.", "If you didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s not your fault. \n\n\nAs someone who has lost 3 children in similar circumstances:  It hurts. It hurts as I type this some 8 years later since the last one passed. \n\n\nShow compassion and sympathy, give them time.  Explain you had no idea and you would have never done this had you known but it is done and an opportunity to celebrate life.  They will forgive you.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't know, you meant no ill will.\n\nI just have to say the double standards are killing me. Any other time people would be flocking to say \"your brother doesn't own the name!!!\" Even in situations dealing with death the majority is adamant. I wonder why it's different with you.", "I think this is totally dependent on your intent. If you genuinely had no idea, then you\u2019re of course not an asshole for doing that.\n\nHowever, if you did know then obviously it\u2019s insensitive. Does that name have some sort of special meaning to your family. \n\nI\u2019m wondering why they would think you knew - that would imply they told you.\n\nTLDR; not the asshole if you genuinely didn\u2019t know but you are the asshole if you knew and did it anyway.", "NAH...IF you really didn't know.  It seems odd to me that you would have no idea at all what your brother wanted to name is daughter.  Being that this all happened recently, his reaction isn't totally unexpected, under the circumstances.", "Okay. I recognize that we are from two very different cultures, and I am not overly knowledgeable about Hinduism, so feel free to educate me if I have anything wrong here.\n\nNTA. You did not know the name they chose due to religious procedure, and it was too late to change your child's name when you found out.\n\nIf they wanted you to not use that name (for a very valid reason), they should have spoken to you about it way before the naming ceremony. \"We would like to ask you to please not use the name Karthika, as it was the name of our daughter.\" I'm sure you would have understood and chosen a different name if they had been upfront, but to wait until the last minute, and then blame you for not jumping to what they wanted you to do is not fair.", "It's definitely the wrong place to go to ask...\n\nAlot of comments are coming from North Americans or Europeans with different cultural norms and standards, and have a hard time looking at things outside their own cultural lens (which is fair, its hard to see things from different perspectives, and harder still the more different said culture is).\n\nFor example, the word \"Cunt\" in Canada is a serious insult, and one of the meanest things one can call a woman. In Australia, its basically a Comma, but I digress...\n\nBy North American standards? Kind of a dick move, and I would say just change it.\n\nTaking into account different cultural norms? Your brothers the asshole here for not telling you in the *9 month leadup* to the birth, and expecting you to just pull a name out of a hat on the day of the ceremony. If I'm understanding the tradition and ceremony correctly, he's the asshole for bugging you about the name before the ceremony in the first place.", "NAH under the assumption that you didn't know the name.\n\nEdit: it takes weeks to choose a name. They should have told you in advance and not before the naming ceremony. But still it must be incredibly hard for them to hear that name. NAH because they grieve.", "What is with the Y T As?\n\nOP, you are clearly NTA, coming from an American who, unlike some of the others on here, can actually understand why you would not know your deceased niece's name. Your brother had every opportunity to mitigate this situation. It is not up to you to make sure that a name you choose will please anyone and everyone around you, especially when you are in the midst of welcoming your baby into the world.\n\nFirst, the timeline indicates that there was approximately a year between the death of the niece and the naming ceremony of the new baby. OP's wife became pregnant \"a few months\" after the death of the niece. The naming ceremony is typically 1-2 weeks after the baby is born, according to a quick Google search.\n\nSecond, OP wasn't even supposed to tell his brother the chosen name. Instead, he gave in because his brother and SIL pestered him until he did. The fact that his brother persisted in harassing OP until OP caved and told him the name tells me that the brother clearly had some motive to know the name. He might have been afraid of exactly what unfolded. However, in that case, the brother could have just TOLD OP what they had planned on naming their baby WELL in advance. \n\nThird, this is a Hindi issue that needs to be observed through that lens. This is not a pair of American siblings fighting over the name \"Roxanne\" for their daughter because they both like The Police. \n\nMany cultures have elaborate ceremonies that would be a disaster to try to change plans for THE DAY OF. Chinese, Korean, and Japanese celebrate 100 Days. Would you ask the host to change a menu item on the day of the ceremony due to allergies? In western culture, the bride picks out a dress months in advance and many of them have it tailored multiple times. Would you ask the bride to switch dresses the day before the wedding? \n\nLastly, regarding choice words that OP used, it is clearly stated that his brother started the name calling. After making a ridiculous demand. After having ample time to mitigate the situation completely. I think many rational, non-asshole people might snap in the same situation. \n\nTo those who are attempting to justify their Y T As with \"I don't understand how you could not know the name,\" that is correct. You **do not understand**. Maybe you should educate yourself on issues that are clearly important to the whole story before you go spewing your opinions. \n\nOP, I hope your brother comes around and apologizes to you. This is nothing more than his grief being taken out on you.", "~~INFO:~~ Assuming their child died of SIDS before her 'official' naming ceremony, wouldn't you have found out the name they had chosen at the time of the burial or funeral services? Or just in conversations at some point?\n\nI'm struggling to understand how this would even happen, accidentally or otherwise.\n\nYTA. I'm not getting why you even posted. You believe your religion justifies your decision about this, and you actually told your brother to \"fuck off\" about it, so you clearly don't think you could be an asshole at all.", "If they never announced the name they planned to give the child there was no way for you to have known. It's impossible for you to have done this \"deliberately\".  Yes, they are being unreasonable but I can understand that with the pain of losing a child reason goes out the window. Their demands, on the day of the ceremony were awkward and troublesome, for sure. Personally, I would give them space to grieve and come to terms with what has happened. But, NO, you are NOT TA.", "NTA. You couldn\u2019t come up with a name last minute and they chose not to share it at any time during the process beforehand.", "What a lot of people are missing here is:\n\n1. Naming a child is not something you should take lightly, it has consequences for that child forever. So trying to rename a child in minutes is a ridiculous request.\n2. The man did not know it was the name his brother had picked for his dead child until minutes before the ceremony. In this culture, the brother should have found out actually during the ceremony. The constant pestering sets off alarms to me. But either way, The op did not know. So there was no intentional disrespect here.\n\nThere is no good solution at this point. Brother will have to get past his grief. But I think OP is NTA. There was no intentional harm caused, and renaming a child is not something you should ask someone to do, even if the child is a baby. Especially after you have already announced the original name to everyone.\n\nfor some reference into a different culture not as prevalent for Americans: https://www.learnreligions.com/namkaran-the-hindu-naming-ceremony-1770021", "NTA. They never told you they planned to use that name, so you didn't deliberately take the name.  You had no time to consider and research other names, so changing it at the point you became aware there was an issue was not an option.", "NTA. \n\nHe said *he didn\u2019t know the name chosen for the niece* and picked the same name by accident. \n\nYes, it is perfectly possible that the niece\u2019s expected name was not revealed to anyone by the parents. This is an extremely common custom in many parts of India. \n\nIt is difficult for the brother and his wife certainly but doesn\u2019t mean OP is an AH for not changing the baby\u2019s name.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEY failed to tell you. Now the name of your kid is fixed. Too bad for them.", "OP has said in his comments that he was not aware of what his brother would have named their child nor had any knowledge of it whatsoever. Wypipo of AITA, don't forget that other cultures, nations, norms, and religions exists outside of your own.\n\nOP is NTA if he truly is unaware. What might be \"suspicious\" to you about the tombstone not saying her name screams ignorance. There's no tombstones in Hinduism as they do cremations.", "If you had no idea then NAH.  I can see why it's unsettling to them though. \n\nTo me that seems like a pretty rare name...is it from your culture or area?  Curious how both of you arrived at it", "NAH \n\nEarlier comments mentioned the paternal aunt as being the person who either names the child or announces it at the naming ceremony. Since they are brothers maybe OP\u2019s brother had told the aunt the name for their child in anticipation of her ceremony, but she died before the ceremony could take place. Brother might believe the aunt knew and told OP but he still chose to use the same name. If this is even a possibility then OP might want to ask aunt if she knew and why didn\u2019t she tell them to use another name.", "I would say this is just an unfortunate outcome of your traditions with your culture. Which sucks for all parties.", "NTA.  The circumstances really don\u2019t matter.  You chose a name for your child. That is the end of the story.", "NAH. And I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with people making judgements and assumptions based on their own cultural norms.\n\nYou did not know the name your brother had intended to give to his daughter, and the fact that you both picked the same name is an unfortunate coincidence. Choosing not to court misfortune by changing the name at the last minute does not make you TA. I assume you would have chosen another name if your niece had lived to her naming ceremony, or if your brother had asked you to avoid a certain name.\n\nBut neither are your brother and his wife TA. It hurt them to hear your daughter being given the name they had intended for their child, and I can\u2019t understand them wanting you to change it in the moment. Try giving them some more time to cool off from what must be a very painful reminder of the child they lost before she even had a name.", "You asked them to fuck off and they did. Where's the issue? NTA.  They'll either come around or they won't. I can definitely understand why they're hurt, but that's honestly a them problem.", " NTA. Check my post history OP - going through something similar. It\u2019s a _name_ - no one owns a name. Especially one that you didn\u2019t even know they were planning to give their child. Just because they were planning to name their child that, doesn\u2019t mean they _did_ name the child that. They can\u2019t get \u201cdibs\u201d on a name.", "NTA\n\nI'm not entirely sure what the people calling you an asshole expected you to do, assuming all this information is correct. You had chosen a name, you didn't know he had chosen the same name for his child, and he asked you to change it on the spot minutes before the ceremony. It's an unfortunate situation but are people really expecting you to have just come up with an entirely new name in moments?", "NAH. You didn\u2019t know it was going to be your niece\u2019s name so you didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\n\nYour brother and his wife and grieving a terrible loss. Hearing the name must have shocked them and I feel for them but expecting you change your daughter\u2019s name minutes before her naming ceremony was unreasonable. But they are grieving and grief tends to affect how we think and act.", "NTA. If anything I would take that as a sign that his child is alright. I don\u2019t know how prevalent Reincarnation is in Hindu (I thought it was but maybe I am more ignorant that I know) but if anything, this is what I interpret it as. The fact that neither of you knew and both came up with the same name to me is a sign.", "NTA. They are still mourning the death of their child. Give them time and space.", "NTA since you didn't know. You can't prevent what you don't know. Your brother could've asked you to avoid that name earlier, especially if it's a common name. But I do understand that they're dealing with a lot of difficult emotions, if you care for your brother you could be the one to reach out.", "NTA. \nYou didn't know what their unnamed child was going to be named, and naming a child is something that should take a lot of thought and have some significance. So you can't possibly change a name on a moments notice to accommodate your family members' insecurities. \nYou also broke tradition by telling them the name because they begged you. \nA part of me thinks that they are bitter or jealous and were so persistent about knowing the name you chose just so they could protest it, no matter what name it was.", "NTA", "NTA at all.

I said that I cannot do that. This discussion was on the same day that the ceremony was supposed to be held. I was not supposed to inform anyone about what name we were going to assign the child (as per Hindu tradition), but they pestered me a lot & I gave in. I said that I am not going to change when the ceremony was going to be held in a few minutes, especially since that would be inauspicious.\n\nThey began to accuse me of doing it deliberately, called me horrible, etc. But I did not relent & went ahead with it.\n\nThe ceremony's over now, and it's her legal name. But they're demanding that I change the gazette to name her something else and were calling me names again. I told them that it's too much to demand such a thing, and asked them to fuck off.

So while the parents have picked out a name, and may think of the child using the name, it doesn\u2019t actually _belong_ to the child until namakarana, and religious philosophy says that they don\u2019t have a name until then. Before the ceremony they\u2019d be referred to by a nickname or as \u201cson/daughter\u201d, and at the ceremony they get their name and are acknowledged as an individual person.\n\nI guess the closest comparison that I can give is the philosophy in some sects of Christianity that life begins at birth, once the child is born and separated from the body of their parent.", "It actually does mean that in Hinduism ..

It's just as likely that the brother was reliving the death of his own child due to this baby reaching such an enormous milestone. And upon reliving it, it dawned on him that he probably should have addressed the name situation. I can absolutely see the brother making the realization, then saying to himself, \"what are the chances?,\" and then working himself up and saying but what if... and then it turns out to be a huge unfortunate coincidence. \n\nOn the other side I can see OP being busy as hell tending to his wife who gave birth a couple weeks prior, while trying to plan/coordinate/otherwise make sure this day goes perfectly, and just barking the name out after being asked for the 50th time that morning.", "How would something be up if OP didn't know the name of the deceased niece in the first place?

They have different rules and rituals than you are used to.", "Yes, in many countries you don't have to give the baby a name right away. In Denmark you have 6 months to do so. If they don't have a name (first name and last name) you'll get a fine until they do. In Denmark you have to apply for the name through the church office. You will never receive a birth certificate, but rather a letter saying that the name you have chosen is accepted. Then you'll receive their health card in the mail, and that takes a couple of weeks, but that is the only documentation you'll get.", "Breaking news: the United States isn't the only fucking country on the planet.\n\n(And before anyone comes at me, I'm American).", "Yes you can", "What's crib death?", "I'm in the UK and yes, you name the baby, legally, after leaving the hospital.", "OP is YTA but this comment is ignorant as duck", "Yes, the baby died of something like SIDS and the naming ceremony hadn't happened yet so the family didn't know the name and it sounds like they didn't share it after the baby died.", "Yes she'd been born, but that doesn't mean they'd had her naming ceremony yet. It's done after they are born, but not right away. It's a religious ceremony that takes time and planning to arrange. It's not like babies arrive on their exact due date very often, so it can't be set in stone ahead of time. They must wait for the birth, then plan it, etc. Idk why his \"I said everything I knew\" reply got 400 downvotes on the top comment, if that is the truth? He has done nothing wrong here. Of course it's very very sad that his brother and sister-in-law lost their daughter, but she passed away before she was publicly named, so OP never knew it. Perhaps a nickname can be used instead? But her legal name will still be the same as stated in the ceremony.", "Sometimes naming ceremony happens after 21 days.", "Yes. After the baby was born and before the ceremony....", "Yes so the baby dies some time between the birth and the naming ceremony.

It's typical for us to choose a name before baby leaves the hospital at the latest but often the name is chosen and shared during pregnancy, after the sex is discovered.  The chosen name may change because the sex was wrong or the baby didn't \"look like\" their name at birth.\n\nThe closest US equivalent I can imagine is a sibling had a miscarriage a year ago and had chosen a name, but not told others, then as I'm getting ready to fill out the birth certificate, telling me I had to choose a different name, because that was the name of the baby they lost.  \n\n(I'm not saying that a miscarriage is the same as an infant death. )", "No, it's not that simple. How OP would know about the name if his brother never tell about it?

And part of the fun is announcing it together to everyone at once.", "Funnily enough the comment I was referring to got deleted. I totally agree with you. From the ceremony I\u2019m familiar with I believe the ceremony happens on the 12th day of the child\u2019s life. I\u2019m not minimising the death of a baby younger than 12 days but there\u2019s a big difference between a new born and a one year old per se. Furthermore OP would\u2019ve had no way to know about the name. I think these commenters don\u2019t realise that in a lot of desi cultures much thought goes into a name beyond just both patents liking it. I\u2019m sure OP looked into astrology, his child\u2019s charts, consulted a priest etc.", "Hmm not sure my personal feeling is that if op\u2019s brother had mentioned it a lot sooner like before the baby was born I would be more on the brothers side.", "Stop looking for a fight with me.", "Europeans meet more people from other cultures because over here there are places you can easily drive through half a dozen completely different countries with their own languages in the time it takes to drive across one US state.

I never said anything about the op. I said the culture of thinking a child is nameless until a ceremony is wrong. That\u2019s what has led to this situation. I agree the op had no chance of knowing.

Fair enough, thanks for the warning. Shame you can't deal with simple rhetoric when you're proven wrong. Have a good night.", "Well then perhaps he should ask his questions in a platform that doesn\u2019t involve mostly Americans, as you stated, if he wants a better perspective. The only question is whether or not he was aware before he chose the name. If he didn\u2019t then he\u2019s not the AH. If he did then he is. They are unreasonable to expect him to rename minutes before the ceremony. If my American understanding of the issue is correct, then that\u2019s the analysis.", "From what I understood from the post and the comments, the brother asked right before the ceremony.

Your opinions or feelings about their culture are irrelevant since you aren't part of it.
