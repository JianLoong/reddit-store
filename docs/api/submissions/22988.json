You are under no obligation to provide baked goods for her kids, especially since they didn't talk to you about it like grown-ups.

It sounds like the situation as it stands is awkward and uncomfortable for your kids, and they are the ones who matter here.", "NAH - Food can be a contentious topic and you sent goodies for your kids to enjoy during their time at their dad's house. You likely did not mean to exclude the kids but it happened. \n\nShe could have been nicer explaining how these treats do not suffice sharing with others. As u/IntrovertedBookMan said, imagine two kids eating an amazing brownie and the other kids have none or 1/5 of one. \n\nYour behavior could be meddling with meal time (ate too many sweets and no room for nutritional food) so consider, when they pack to be a dad's house; let the experience be what is only offered there.", "INFO: how much is enough for \"the two of them to share for the weekend?\" Are you sending just one or two cookies each? Are you expecting them to sneak them late at night if others are around?\n\nTo keep the peace it might be best to send one dozen items.

Heck, she didn't even have to call you; she could have had your ex call you.\n\nCommunicating is what grownups do. Making the kids feel guilty for having snacks sent with them is not. \n\nYou probably didn't even think about the issues not having enough to share might cause. After all, you don't have step kids coming around your place. So now you know. I can see how two of the kids having treats could cause problems with the others. I mean, what kid doesn't want some goodies to munch?  So next time, just send over one container with a bunch of goodies inside and a note that says, \"Hope you all enjoy these!\" Be the grownup. \n\nHeck, now I want a cookie! ;)", "NTA - you aren\u2019t showing off, you are providing your children with food that they like. It is unacceptable that she would throw your children\u2019s food away. Sorry she is being so passive aggressive about it. Talk to the ex and see what he says.", "NTA. \"Politely sending them home untouched\" is really passive aggressive and controlling behaviour too. Especially as instead of bringing it up with you, they decided to bring your kids into it. Your kids aren't going to be well equipped to understand how to process this conflict.\n\nThey aren't operating in good faith, and they aren't treating you or your kids with respect. They are using passive aggressive behaviour, and avoiding direct conflict to control people.\n\nAbsolutely shit person bringing children into such a nonsense conflict. If she acts this way around her own kids they are going to need so much therapy.", "NTA - You said you'd have no idea of knowing if her kids will be there or not, fair enough. You could ask but why should you go out of your way to bake for the other kids if you dont know them well. Baking for your own kids is completely reasonable, when she goes to a park and other kids get ice creams and hers don't does she go to the other parents and kindly say \"buy ice-cream for everyone not just your kids\" (bit extreme example but I've read too many of these and am quite done tonight) I'm sure if her ex started giving her kids gifts while your kids were present she wouldn't demand fair treatment for them.", "Info: did you send the goodies with your kids with specific instructions that they are not to be shared with their stepsiblings?", "NTA. There was no need for passive aggression by the new wife. Now you know, suggest saving the homemade goods for when your children are with you. \n\nMight be worth having a conversation with your kids around what goes on at that house.

It sounds like you have good intentions, but sending food with your kids when they go to the other parent's house can come off as passive-aggressive or judgmental, as though you don't believe the other parent is providing for them. If you do want to send a treat every now and then, the polite thing to do is to send enough for everyone. Or just don't. The kids can live without home-baked treats for a couple of days.", "NTA. I think you and your kids\u2019 step mom have different ideas when it comes to etiquette. When your kids go to their dad\u2019s house they are members of that household. I was taught that if you send food for one member of a household, you should supply enough for them to share with everyone who lives there. That\u2019s what my mom does and it\u2019s what my grandmothers did. \n\nThe step mom is wrong for being so passive aggressive but I think this can be easily fixed by calling your ex and trying to come to an understanding. The easiest solution would be to save the \u201cmommy bakes\u201d for when your kids are with you. These weekends are your ex\u2019s time to take care of the kids so let him decide what treats the kids get when they\u2019re with him.", "NTA- but am I the only one thinking stepmom wants to eat the treats too. You said she doesn't always have her kids and have no way of knowing when she will have them but that they last 3 or so times the kids haven't gotten their treats.

Bake them something when they are with you, or bake for everybody, not just your children. Why are you sending them with food, anyway? You expect they won't get fed there? It's insulting to the new wife. People say she's passive-aggressive for the note she sent you, but your sending the kids with food in the bag may be seen as passive-aggressive, too.", "YTA if you\u2019re sending treats with your kids but not enough to share with the other kids in the household. Do you expect stepmom to hand your kids delicious brownies or whatever, and let the other kids just\u2026..watch them eat?", "YTA. You mean well and it comes from a good place, but you should send enough for everyone if you\u2019re sending them with food. Especially when there\u2019s a chance of other kids being there, it just creates unnecessary friction to not send enough for everyone. Their stepmom didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t send it, just to send plenty to share. You don\u2019t need to start drama between all the kids when they\u2019re at their dads. It\u2019s not fair to anyone.", "YTA. Your kids can go a weekend without mommy bakes. Give your ex a chance to treat them. Or send over a dozen to be shared with whoever is around.", "ESH\n\nI get it. You want your kids to have something that reminds them of mommy while they're away so they know and feel loved.  You're a soft a. h.  Send them with a plushy or one of your sweatshirts or something. You're sending just enough ONLY for your kids.  You think if the other CHILDREN (doesn't matter if they're over 12. Kids are kids and they all want love) see your kids eating a brownie they'll not be jealous? I get that they're not your kids and not responsible for them. But a great way to build resentment and animosity is allowing your kids to have treats while other kids look on.  Stop being petty with food.  \n\nHaving said that, wow passive aggressive step mom.  She has kids she should be able to understand your position.  She could've just called and spoke to you like an adult.   She could've just explained and asked you to save their treats for the car ride over or car ride back or ask you if you could make enough for the family.  The whole \"bring enough to share\" note and then saying she'll throw it out is just rude.  \n\nI would either not send any next trip or send enough for everyone. Co parenting is hard enough between the divorced couple. Blending families are even tougher.  Hope the adults can all work together. Take care.", "NTa that is not your kids not your problem to bake with", "It would be a class act if you baked enough for all the kids.

Going forward maybe if she tells you the other kids are there you can bake more. However that\u2019s entirely up to you. \n\nId also be asking your ex how the treat thing went down because your kids not telling you originally why makes me feel like stepmom wasn\u2019t nice about it.", "NTA.

I appear to be in the minority here but I've done the co-parenting with step kids thing and it's not fair to the other kids that your kids show up with treats just for them.\n\nSeriously, if you like baking so much, make enough for your kids to share with everyone in your ex's household. Assume their stepsibs will be there.\n\nThink of it this way:  How would you feel if, while your kids are there the stepmother made ice cream sundaes for her kids but not yours. Would that be OK with you? Would your kids shrug it off because they aren't her kids? Somehow I doubt it.\n\nIt also sounds like you have a decent co-parenting relationship with your ex. Is this really a hill you want to die on? Because I can tell you, life is a whole lot less stressful for you and your kids if you keep it civil or, better, actually keep it friendly.", "You're not the asshole for having sent treats without realizing the issue, but you don't need to send your kids with cookies to visit their dad's. When their dad has them, their dad can provide and ration their treats. You don't send kids with their own meals to their other custodial parent like their dad is just babysitting them. Just like the teachers who tell kids to bring enough gum for the class next time, I don't think your ex wants you to send him a bunch of treats for everyone but to stop entirely. \n\nESH.", "ESH\n\nOP, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you where not malicious, merely inconsiderate of the fact that your kids are trying to adapt to a new family dynamic. Only giving *them* home baked treats is awkward towards their new stepsiblings. So \"you suck\", but NTA.\n\nHOWEVER the stepmom is 100% an asshole.\n\n*forbidding* your kids from eating the treats their mother gave them.\n\nThreatening to throw future treats away.\n\nWhat did she say to your kids that they felt uncomfertable telling you why they didn't eat their cookies?\n\nYour kids are young, i'm sure they felt they where being punished by the stepmom, who forbad them to eat the cookies.\n\nIt seems she decided to discipline and restrict the diet of *your* kids.\n\nAnd since the note was only from her, you *need* to talk to your ex, their father, about this.", "YTA - it\u2019s lovely that you\u2019re baking for your children but it\u2019s not your place to send things when the other parent has custody. It would be weird if their father sent them to your house loaded with snacks right?\n\nBy sending them without enough to share, you\u2019re also creating a rift between them and their step siblings. Whether this is intentional or not, it\u2019s still what\u2019s happening. \n\nWould you send your children to their friends house with only enough for them or would you send enough for their friend too? Of course you\u2019d send enough for the friend, it\u2019s no different here.", "I thought it read 'am I the asshole for baking my own children?' And I was going to say yes... yes you are.  I'll go read the post now.", "NTA. I could see eating them in front of other children can be upsetting to the kids so yeah sending more would be nice and help. But wtf why wouldn\u2019t she just talk to you about the problem like \u201chey my kids really want the cookies your kids are bringing over can you send some more that would help us out a lot\u201d why would you not let them eat cookies their mom gave them and send a passive note with it. You do not owe her kids cookies it would be nice but it\u2019s up too you not her.", "NTA. She could have just asked nicely.", "NTA!!", "INFO: why can\u2019t they just have baked goods the 5 days a week they stay with you, if you aren\u2019t willing to provide enough to share?", "NTA. However, while this may a very unpopular opinion, OP should have called stepmom instead of texting. I get that stepmom was passive aggressive with the note, but people tend to get a lot braver on text messages (and written notes) and say things they wouldn\u2019t normally say out loud because it\u2019s easy to forget there\u2019s an actual human being with feelings on the receiving end.", "Why did OP respond to the wife and not her ex?", "That is the only reason I clicked on the post tbh. I was like \"wait, whaaaaat?\"", "Me too", "Same. I was like \"wtf is this new nonsense?\" lol", "I was always the kid that didn't have anything and my friends would share with me, no matter how little they had. NTA, OP provided for her children, children could learn to share or other mother could provide for her family and include the children, you know, share. Other mother should provide instead of causing this conflict.", "What\u2019s NAH?", "The children bringing delectable snacks with them to their father's home, but not enough to share with the other children could be seen as rude. It is setting up a situation where strife between the children is occurring .  How would the mother feel if her children received  a lesser quality of dinner, or she made delicious items just for her children in front of the visiting children.  Say she made delicious cinnamon rolls for breakfast, but not enough for the visitors.  What if she only left the visitors drink water  while her children got milkshakes?  kt", "She didn't throw it away though, she sent it back home because sending food only for OP's kids was not acceptable in the other household.  She only said she'd throw it away when OP didn't catch on and kept sending it, and she is giving her the opportunity to just send enough for everyone instead.  There's no indication that OP's kids are problem eaters or aren't getting enough food they like at their fathers, it's just OP not being able to let them go to their father's for one weekend every two weeks without sending little things for whatever reason.   Sending no food is what OP should be doing, unless it's a birthday or something where she provides a cake for the whole family.", "Yeah. If I send stuff with my kid to his dad's house, I send enough to share. Because I've got nothing against his step-siblings. And it's a dick move for one kid to be eating fancy custom baking in front of the other kids", "As much as OP is YTA for this, the other mother's behaviour is unacceptable. Controlling and passive-aggresive. OP should both rethink her actions and have a serious talk with his ex's wife.", "YTa, yep exactly this.  You provide at your house, they provide at theirs.", "Absolutely this.", "No one makes two cookies or two brownies.  It is basically no extra work to send a dozen for the whole family, she is just choosing not to.  A \"no food\" policy would be best.  It's one weekend.  OP can live without sending her kids little things to try to win their affection for two days.", "Your example is flawed. It would be if the step mother took her kids and OPs kids to the park, but only bought her own children ice cream while OPs had none.\n\nWould you send your kids to a friends house with only enough baked goods for only them or would that be kind of rude?", "Yup", "I agree, it seems passive aggressive sending the food.  Like OP doesn't think whatever they provide is good enough.", "I wouldn't say that the stepmom is passive aggressive, so much as I would say that she's aggressive aggressive. She's Lady Tremaine or Agatha trunchbull. The idea of some horrible stepmother rifling through her stepchildren's belongings and confiscating their mother's baked cookies from them is infuriating. Utterly infuriating. If OP wanted to bake for the other kids, that would be very kind of her, and frankly it would be nice to do. However, the stepmom refusing to let the children eat the treats they brought with them, never mind threatening to throw them away? Good lord! That is absolutely beyond the pale. Those are the belongings of her stepchildren and absolutely none of her business. The idea of throwing them away...\n\nStepmom sounds like a movie villain, literally.", "OP did mention that she doesn't know when the stepmom's kids stay with her....the first time stepmom could have said that if you want to send food can you send more since her kids are at home, but she chose to be passive aggressive about it.", "So she\u2019s not allowed to send her kids with a taste of home because mommy dearest doesn\u2019t like it? BS.", "So you think it's OK for the stepmother to buy ice cream for her kids and not give for op kids while they are there? Who make the meals at the ex house while the kids are there?", "Yes, I got completely hung up on that also.", "This! They lied about it multiple times. WTH is going on that her kids would have to lie about why they didn't eat the cookies.", "It's the step mother obligated to make meals to all the kids or just her kids? If the stepmother buy ice cream to her kids, should she share between all the kids or should she make op kids watch wile her kids eat ice cream?", "Who do you think that make the meals while her kids are at the ex house? Do the stepmother let the kids starve because \"it's not her kids, not her problem\"?", "And who cooks the meals while the kids are at the ex house?", "Or they gave the kids other food so they were to full to eat cookies", "So its ok for the step mother to buy ice cream for her kid only?", "Who do you think cooks the meals while op kids are at the ex house? It would be OK if stepmother bought ice cream.only for her kids and let op kids without it?", "Who cook the meals while her kids are at the ex house?

Let Dad and his family guide food and other decisions.", ">Other mother should provide instead of causing this conflict.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why the other mother should provide to avoid the conflict of OP providing.\n\nMaybe they don\u2019t want their own children eating as much sweets and OP sending her own kids with treats makes that harder, maybe this influx of baked goods is interfering with meal times?", "No Arseholes Here", "No Assholes Here", "It means No Assholes Here (no one\u2019s the AH)", "No assholes here", "Really seems off base to me. They can be from the house of a baker and bring a mom treat from their home without this hostile interpretation.", "You really took this and ran with it.

To be fair, I may be reacting based on experiences a friend of mine had with his ex, who always insisted on sending the kids with some \u2018real food\u2019 because she couldn\u2019t stand that he bought cookies, etc, at the store instead of baking them from scratch.", "No, she shouldn't do it because it's pretty rude. They'll be fine without a \"taste of her home\" while at their fathers.", "She\u2019s not allowed to cause issues at their father\u2019s house for everyone else and her kids, no. That\u2019s inappropriate. Further, why is she sending food anyway? That\u2019s their dad\u2019s time with them. He deserves to get to treat them himself if he wants. She has them most of the time and gets to bond and have treats with them. When it\u2019s dad\u2019s time, she should probably butt out. She acknowledges that she\u2019s sending treats without knowing how many children will be there. I know she didn\u2019t do it to be rude, but sending the treats to begin with is bordering on rude, not sending enough for everyone is just rude. Their stepmom suggesting with a note that she send enough for everyone if she\u2019s going to send anything is just informing OP how manners work at that point tbh. I\u2019m sure OP means well, but she\u2019s YTA for etiquette reasons. Let dad spend time with his kids without interference and don\u2019t cause tension between your kids and their stepsiblings for your own ego is kind of basic coparenting etiquette.", "Yes. And if OP had a problem with it, they should both agree to not send treats with their respective kids to either house.", "And also, from what I\u2019ve gathered from this story, it sounds like OP is on good enough terms with her ex that she knows this wasn\u2019t him.", "I agree with this, especially since they are only there for one weekend every other week.  It's not like they need school lunches with special items.  Intrusive and exclusionary is how it sounds indeed. Let dad buy ice cream or whatever for those two days.  I said YTA.", "My ex has a great co parenting relationship with the mother of his daughters. They would come over with food all the time, they would leave here with food. It wasn't a big deal. \n\nIf they showed up with some kind of snack, and the boys wanted some? One of us would make/buy more of it. If the girls didn't want to share, we didn't force them to. \n\nOP *made the wedding cake* for those two. Stepmom is being oddly territorial when actual communication would be far more productive. Why is OP expected to (literally) cater to this passive aggression? \n\nI vote NTA.", "\u201cI\u2019m not wondering why the mom needs to send baked goods for a snack and in their lunch when they are at Dad\u2019s house\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t grasp any reason why a mother would give her kids some treats to take when they\u2019re away from her?

Alternatively she stands her ground and the relationship will probably not improve but her kids will either get treats or the treats will be thrown away. It would be nice for the other children to get the cookies but that isn't her responsibility, they could come to an arrangement where she bakes them cookies for the weekend but again they'd have to have a long conversation about boundaries between the days and what they see as appropriate and inappropriate while the other has the kids in their care, if this makes sense?\n\nNow thats done (I'm probably not gonna respond anymore because reddit arguments are long, boring and frankly I'm just trying to sleep and once I do wake up I may decide to try to articulate what I mean)", "OP, explained, that the Stepmum, doesn't have a regular custody arrangement. So she has no way of knowing when the older children will or won't be there.\nPersonally, it's rather, spiteful of the Stepmum, to not allow the younger children to have their baked snacks. \nIf she wants her kids to have some snacks, she should just ask OP to please send some extra, on a Weekend that she knows her children will be there.\n\nOr, gasp, bake some goodies herself with her children, from 11 onwards, I was baking delicious things. It's not that hard, and is a good skill to have.\n\nOP is NTA, Stepmum is TAH", "Seeing as the other kids get treats from their own mom, yes I do. If the kids get sad remind them of it.

What if she gave the stepchildren water or plain milk for lunch or dinner, when her children were given several options?  It is rude and divisive to send delectable home made treats just for her daughters   while the other children just get to watch.
