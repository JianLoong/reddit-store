(not to me) I actually was a lesbian all along. We have two kids together (9f and 8m). My ex got remarried 2 years ago and for the last 6 months the arrangement has been our kids stay with their dad every other weekend. His wife has three kids from another marriage (all 12+) and they don\u2019t have a super consistent custody arrangement, so I never know when they\u2019ll be with their mom. \n\nI\u2019m a big time hobby baker, (I even made my ex\u2019s wedding cake when he got remarried) and it brings me so much joy to cook and bake for the people I love. My kid\u2019s affectionately call my creations \u201cmommy bakes\u201d. Since my kid\u2019s started spending consistent time at their dad\u2019s, I\u2019ve been sending them off with enough \u201cmommy bakes\u201d for the two of them to share for the weekend. Recently I noticed when I unpack their bags, the goodies are untouched. I asked them about it, and the first couple times they said they just weren\u2019t hungry or that their stepmom had made them something instead. \n\nThis last weekend, they came home with the goodies still packaged and a note that said \u201cbring enough to share\u201d. I texted their stepmom about it, and she sent me a lengthy text about how her kids don\u2019t think it\u2019s very fair that my kids get \u201cspecial treatment\u201d and that going forward she\u2019ll start throwing the treats away instead of \u201cpolitely\u201d sending them home untouched. I haven\u2019t responded because I\u2019m not quite sure what to say, I never thought providing food for my kids for the weekend would cause a problem. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT: since a lot of people are hung up on the quantity, I explained in a comment that the rest of what I make is put in their school lunches for the week\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you everyone for your input! Even the more harsh ones really helped put things into perspective. My kid\u2019s health, joy, and wellbeing will always come first and I\u2019ve put that in jeopardy by not being more flexible and accepting of our reality. I\u2019m not going to send any more treats unless it\u2019s a special event and in that case I\u2019ll send a whole batch over to the house.\n\nAnd thanks for the group chat suggestion!

You are under no obligation to provide baked goods for her kids, especially since they didn't talk to you about it like grown-ups.

It sounds like the situation as it stands is awkward and uncomfortable for your kids, and they are the ones who matter here.", "NAH - Food can be a contentious topic and you sent goodies for your kids to enjoy during their time at their dad's house. You likely did not mean to exclude the kids but it happened. \n\nShe could have been nicer explaining how these treats do not suffice sharing with others. As u/IntrovertedBookMan said, imagine two kids eating an amazing brownie and the other kids have none or 1/5 of one. \n\nYour behavior could be meddling with meal time (ate too many sweets and no room for nutritional food) so consider, when they pack to be a dad's house; let the experience be what is only offered there.", "INFO: how much is enough for \"the two of them to share for the weekend?\" Are you sending just one or two cookies each? Are you expecting them to sneak them late at night if others are around?\n\nTo keep the peace it might be best to send one dozen items. That's enough for your kids (and maybe your ex) to have a few each, or other kids to eat one if they happen to be there.", "NTA\n\nGeez, all she had to do was give you a call and ask that if you send goodies over with the kids, please send enough to share so that there aren't arguments in the family over the goodies. Heck, she didn't even have to call you; she could have had your ex call you.\n\nCommunicating is what grownups do. Making the kids feel guilty for having snacks sent with them is not. \n\nYou probably didn't even think about the issues not having enough to share might cause. After all, you don't have step kids coming around your place. So now you know. I can see how two of the kids having treats could cause problems with the others. I mean, what kid doesn't want some goodies to munch?  So next time, just send over one container with a bunch of goodies inside and a note that says, \"Hope you all enjoy these!\" Be the grownup. \n\nHeck, now I want a cookie! ;)", "NTA - you aren\u2019t showing off, you are providing your children with food that they like. It is unacceptable that she would throw your children\u2019s food away. Sorry she is being so passive aggressive about it. Talk to the ex and see what he says.", "NTA. \"Politely sending them home untouched\" is really passive aggressive and controlling behaviour too. Especially as instead of bringing it up with you, they decided to bring your kids into it. Your kids aren't going to be well equipped to understand how to process this conflict.\n\nThey aren't operating in good faith, and they aren't treating you or your kids with respect. They are using passive aggressive behaviour, and avoiding direct conflict to control people.\n\nAbsolutely shit person bringing children into such a nonsense conflict. If she acts this way around her own kids they are going to need so much therapy.", "NTA - You said you'd have no idea of knowing if her kids will be there or not, fair enough. You could ask but why should you go out of your way to bake for the other kids if you dont know them well. Baking for your own kids is completely reasonable, when she goes to a park and other kids get ice creams and hers don't does she go to the other parents and kindly say \"buy ice-cream for everyone not just your kids\" (bit extreme example but I've read too many of these and am quite done tonight) I'm sure if her ex started giving her kids gifts while your kids were present she wouldn't demand fair treatment for them.", "Info: did you send the goodies with your kids with specific instructions that they are not to be shared with their stepsiblings?", "NTA. There was no need for passive aggression by the new wife. Now you know, suggest saving the homemade goods for when your children are with you. \n\nMight be worth having a conversation with your kids around what goes on at that house. Sounds like stepmother told them in some way not to eat what you packed, and they didn\u2019t feel like they could or should tell you.", "Gentle YTA. It sounds like you have good intentions, but sending food with your kids when they go to the other parent's house can come off as passive-aggressive or judgmental, as though you don't believe the other parent is providing for them. If you do want to send a treat every now and then, the polite thing to do is to send enough for everyone. Or just don't. The kids can live without home-baked treats for a couple of days.", "NTA. I think you and your kids\u2019 step mom have different ideas when it comes to etiquette. When your kids go to their dad\u2019s house they are members of that household. I was taught that if you send food for one member of a household, you should supply enough for them to share with everyone who lives there. That\u2019s what my mom does and it\u2019s what my grandmothers did. \n\nThe step mom is wrong for being so passive aggressive but I think this can be easily fixed by calling your ex and trying to come to an understanding. The easiest solution would be to save the \u201cmommy bakes\u201d for when your kids are with you. These weekends are your ex\u2019s time to take care of the kids so let him decide what treats the kids get when they\u2019re with him.", "NTA- but am I the only one thinking stepmom wants to eat the treats too. You said she doesn't always have her kids and have no way of knowing when she will have them but that they last 3 or so times the kids haven't gotten their treats. IF she didn't have her kids all of the times it makes me wonder if she didn't ask the kids where hers was (you baked her cake so she knows  how well you bake), and then tell them if they didn't want to share with her and their dad they couldn't have them.", "NTA, but I would say just send enough for all the kids anyways just to be safe", "YTA. Bake them something when they are with you, or bake for everybody, not just your children. Why are you sending them with food, anyway? You expect they won't get fed there? It's insulting to the new wife. People say she's passive-aggressive for the note she sent you, but your sending the kids with food in the bag may be seen as passive-aggressive, too.", "YTA if you\u2019re sending treats with your kids but not enough to share with the other kids in the household. Do you expect stepmom to hand your kids delicious brownies or whatever, and let the other kids just\u2026..watch them eat?", "YTA. You mean well and it comes from a good place, but you should send enough for everyone if you\u2019re sending them with food. Especially when there\u2019s a chance of other kids being there, it just creates unnecessary friction to not send enough for everyone. Their stepmom didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t send it, just to send plenty to share. You don\u2019t need to start drama between all the kids when they\u2019re at their dads. It\u2019s not fair to anyone.", "YTA. Your kids can go a weekend without mommy bakes. Give your ex a chance to treat them. Or send over a dozen to be shared with whoever is around.", "ESH\n\nI get it. You want your kids to have something that reminds them of mommy while they're away so they know and feel loved.  You're a soft a. h.  Send them with a plushy or one of your sweatshirts or something. You're sending just enough ONLY for your kids.  You think if the other CHILDREN (doesn't matter if they're over 12. Kids are kids and they all want love) see your kids eating a brownie they'll not be jealous? I get that they're not your kids and not responsible for them. But a great way to build resentment and animosity is allowing your kids to have treats while other kids look on.  Stop being petty with food.  \n\nHaving said that, wow passive aggressive step mom.  She has kids she should be able to understand your position.  She could've just called and spoke to you like an adult.   She could've just explained and asked you to save their treats for the car ride over or car ride back or ask you if you could make enough for the family.  The whole \"bring enough to share\" note and then saying she'll throw it out is just rude.  \n\nI would either not send any next trip or send enough for everyone. Co parenting is hard enough between the divorced couple. Blending families are even tougher.  Hope the adults can all work together. Take care.", "NTa that is not your kids not your problem to bake with", "It would be a class act if you baked enough for all the kids.

Going forward maybe if she tells you the other kids are there you can bake more. However that\u2019s entirely up to you. \n\nId also be asking your ex how the treat thing went down because your kids not telling you originally why makes me feel like stepmom wasn\u2019t nice about it.", "NTA.

And exclusionary because even if OP doesn\u2019t know when the step siblings are there, they are going to feel excluded on the nice dessert (unless their mom also bakes the other kids, but it seems unfair to put that expectation on them). So even if OP is trying to do a nice thing for her kids, she\u2019s intruding on ex husband\u2019s parenting time.\n\nHowever, based on the note (horrible way of communicating through the kids btw), I guess step mom is not unhappy about OP deciding on the dessert every weekend the kids are over, so perhaps just be better safe than sorry and send more baked goods to keep the peace?

You\u2019re creating issues at your children\u2019s other home because you like to bake for them.

You\u2019re not sending them off to school, you\u2019re sending them to the other part of their family, and creating a divide that doesn\u2019t need to be there. I would have sent a note after the first batch", "Soft Y T A but ESH.\n\nThe reasons are a few for you being an AH, but you are not a total AH. I think it comes from a mostly good place. But if it doesn't stop, it will cause big issues. \n\nFirstly, you are imposing yourself on your children's weekend with their dad. You are specifying these are mummy bakes rather than treats for their whole family. They may want to bake, they may want to not have those treats for dessert, they may want to eat out, you don't know, it's not your weekend. This brings me onto the second. You are driving an, not sure intentional, wedge in their blended family, almost like staking a flag saying 'my kids'. Blending a family is tough, especially when one half have delicious cookies from their mum and the others don't. As long as he is sticking to the parenting rules agreed by you two, you have no say in the other aspects when your kids are at his house. Please tell me you are communicating about the important things with children like rules and expectations on behaviour and bed times etc... So they are consistent. \n\nThirdly, you are probably unintentionally making his wife feel in a difficult position. And your ex for that matter. They have to the try to explain to your children why they can't have them, and that's just adding to the stress.\n\nYour kids love you, you don't need to stamp it all over them when they are at you exs. Leave mummy bakes to your house. Make it a special thing and maybe, ask your ex if its OK to make them for their family, so your daughters can take some with them for all of them. But only if its suitable. Ask. This is the fourth reason. You are also an AH for not asking if its OK. They are your kids but it is not your weekend and they have a different situation there. As above, communicate. You have to communicate about parenting, this counts too. \n\nNow, the step mum is being an AH by also not bringing it up to you directly, and so is your ex. Talk to eachother like adults who Co parent. If you can't discuss cookies how are you going to discuss all the issues that arise with bring up children who need stability even across homes?\n\nThe real issue here is that your kids have been put in a horrible position and had to take the cookies home with a note on. The grown ups need to grow up so the kids don't have to deal with more of this. It's hard enough trying to live two lives without one (you), adding things into the mix that just don't need to be there.\n\nUltimately it is you who made the first mistake and need to fix this. Call your ex and arrange for a meeting, maybe not coffee and cakes, with him and his wife. Apologise and discuss how to talk to your kids about this as it has been notices and they are uncomfortable about it. Do not ignore it. Also, if you want to bake for their family, ask them to let you know if they want bakes, and how many. If you don't, don't bring it up.\n\nGood luck, it's going to be a tough road. But please communicate and agree on things for the sake of your kids. From a kid in one of those situations turned adult in therapy.", "YTA if your not sure who's there send extra or don't send anything.

It would be much nicer if you send them with a quantity for everyone, some weekend. The other wife should have used her words ro communicate better, so ESH.\n\nA special mention of ash, to op, for emphasing the divorce was no surprise to her, because she is a lesbian. Was the ex husband aware or he served to op, as \" a beard\" as we would say if the sexes were inverted?

The only time having a beard *isn't* incredibly selfish is if the beard gives informed consent to the arrangement.\n\n...\n\nAnyway, for now, my vote is NTA. Your ex's new wife should not be doing this. She has no moral or legal right to prevent your children from eating baked goods made by their mother, nor to threaten to throw them away. I think you should forward the text and note to your lawyer and inform your ex-husband that if he or his wife do this again, you'll take them to court.\n\nIf I was one of your kids, this stunt would make me resent my stepmother and father.

The kids can survive for 2 days every 2 weeks without her baking or she can send a whole batch of cookies with the kids instead of 2 cookies each. \n\nWhether she should be responsible for the step kids or not, it\u2019s the easiest way to preserve whatever peace there is between everyone.

Honestly you're right it's not passive aggressive it's full on aggressive. OP just shows her love for her kids through food and doesn't know when the step mothers kids (who are much older) are going to be there so she sends a little treat so that they think of their mom while they're gone. That's how I interpret it at least because there doesn't seem to be any negative feelings otherwise in this family dynamic so I don't see why OP would do this to be mean to the other kids or get at the step mother.

This leads to negative feelings building up until an explosion occurs. It\u2019s unhealthy behavior because the impact it has on others is they have to deal with your constant explosions, because they (understandably) missed all the indirect clues. \n\nThe stepmom indirectly communicated her negative feelings, by sending the treats back unopened, with no attached communication or follow-up. She assumed Mom would be able to catch the indirect hint. When Mom didn\u2019t understand her indirect clues, she blamed this on Mom\u2019s inability to understand (rather than on her own inability to clearly communicate) and she unleashed the built up negativity with a whole long text accusing Mom of not thinking of the teenagers and threatening to throw the treats in the trash unopened. So instead of just communicating clearly and calmly - like is expected of adults - Mom was hit with an unexpected explosion of pent up negative emotions and accusations.", "I had an English teacher in high school who had a habit of getting these giant, fancy cupcakes from a bakery for students birthdays.

There is nothing even the tiniest bit weird about OP having a hobby they\u2019re excited about and wanting to share that with her kids as a special treat while they are away. Also, your paraphrasing pretty severely twists the meaning of what OP actually said with your addition of \u201conly for\u201d. \n\nThat being said, I think NAH is the most appropriate. Both sides could be a bit more thoughtful about how the other is affected, and communicate more openly about solutions instead of the passive aggression.

So text back, \"Oh my goodness, of course I'll send more baked goods so your kids can have some too. I love baking and I'm flattered by your request!\" That way you are promoting sharing and you're being the bigger person. And you're picking your battles.
