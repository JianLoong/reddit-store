(not to me) I actually was a lesbian all along. We have two kids together (9f and 8m). My ex got remarried 2 years ago and for the last 6 months the arrangement has been our kids stay with their dad every other weekend.

My kid\u2019s affectionately call my creations \u201cmommy bakes\u201d. Since my kid\u2019s started spending consistent time at their dad\u2019s, I\u2019ve been sending them off with enough \u201cmommy bakes\u201d for the two of them to share for the weekend. Recently I noticed when I unpack their bags, the goodies are untouched. I asked them about it, and the first couple times they said they just weren\u2019t hungry or that their stepmom had made them something instead. \n\nThis last weekend, they came home with the goodies still packaged and a note that said \u201cbring enough to share\u201d. I texted their stepmom about it, and she sent me a lengthy text about how her kids don\u2019t think it\u2019s very fair that my kids get \u201cspecial treatment\u201d and that going forward she\u2019ll start throwing the treats away instead of \u201cpolitely\u201d sending them home untouched.

You are under no obligation to provide baked goods for her kids, especially since they didn't talk to you about it like grown-ups. However, in the name of family peace it might be wise to start sending them with a large enough desert to share if you want to continue sending food. It sounds like the situation as it stands is awkward and uncomfortable for your kids, and they are the ones who matter here.", "NAH - Food can be a contentious topic and you sent goodies for your kids to enjoy during their time at their dad's house. You likely did not mean to exclude the kids but it happened. \n\nShe could have been nicer explaining how these treats do not suffice sharing with others. As u/IntrovertedBookMan said, imagine two kids eating an amazing brownie and the other kids have none or 1/5 of one. \n\nYour behavior could be meddling with meal time (ate too many sweets and no room for nutritional food) so consider, when they pack to be a dad's house; let the experience be what is only offered there.", "INFO: how much is enough for \"the two of them to share for the weekend?\" Are you sending just one or two cookies each? Are you expecting them to sneak them late at night if others are around?\n\nTo keep the peace it might be best to send one dozen items. That's enough for your kids (and maybe your ex) to have a few each, or other kids to eat one if they happen to be there.", "NTA\n\nGeez, all she had to do was give you a call and ask that if you send goodies over with the kids, please send enough to share so that there aren't arguments in the family over the goodies. Heck, she didn't even have to call you; she could have had your ex call you.\n\nCommunicating is what grownups do. Making the kids feel guilty for having snacks sent with them is not. \n\nYou probably didn't even think about the issues not having enough to share might cause. After all, you don't have step kids coming around your place. So now you know. I can see how two of the kids having treats could cause problems with the others. I mean, what kid doesn't want some goodies to munch?  So next time, just send over one container with a bunch of goodies inside and a note that says, \"Hope you all enjoy these!\" Be the grownup. \n\nHeck, now I want a cookie! ;)", "NTA - you aren\u2019t showing off, you are providing your children with food that they like. It is unacceptable that she would throw your children\u2019s food away. Sorry she is being so passive aggressive about it. Talk to the ex and see what he says.", "NTA. \"Politely sending them home untouched\" is really passive aggressive and controlling behaviour too. Especially as instead of bringing it up with you, they decided to bring your kids into it. Your kids aren't going to be well equipped to understand how to process this conflict.\n\nThey aren't operating in good faith, and they aren't treating you or your kids with respect. They are using passive aggressive behaviour, and avoiding direct conflict to control people.\n\nAbsolutely shit person bringing children into such a nonsense conflict. If she acts this way around her own kids they are going to need so much therapy.", "NTA - You said you'd have no idea of knowing if her kids will be there or not, fair enough. You could ask but why should you go out of your way to bake for the other kids if you dont know them well. Baking for your own kids is completely reasonable, when she goes to a park and other kids get ice creams and hers don't does she go to the other parents and kindly say \"buy ice-cream for everyone not just your kids\" (bit extreme example but I've read too many of these and am quite done tonight) I'm sure if her ex started giving her kids gifts while your kids were present she wouldn't demand fair treatment for them.", "Info: did you send the goodies with your kids with specific instructions that they are not to be shared with their stepsiblings?", "NTA. There was no need for passive aggression by the new wife. Now you know, suggest saving the homemade goods for when your children are with you. \n\nMight be worth having a conversation with your kids around what goes on at that house. Sounds like stepmother told them in some way not to eat what you packed, and they didn\u2019t feel like they could or should tell you.", "Gentle YTA. It sounds like you have good intentions, but sending food with your kids when they go to the other parent's house can come off as passive-aggressive or judgmental, as though you don't believe the other parent is providing for them. If you do want to send a treat every now and then, the polite thing to do is to send enough for everyone. Or just don't. The kids can live without home-baked treats for a couple of days.", "NTA. I think you and your kids\u2019 step mom have different ideas when it comes to etiquette. When your kids go to their dad\u2019s house they are members of that household. I was taught that if you send food for one member of a household, you should supply enough for them to share with everyone who lives there. That\u2019s what my mom does and it\u2019s what my grandmothers did. \n\nThe step mom is wrong for being so passive aggressive but I think this can be easily fixed by calling your ex and trying to come to an understanding. The easiest solution would be to save the \u201cmommy bakes\u201d for when your kids are with you. These weekends are your ex\u2019s time to take care of the kids so let him decide what treats the kids get when they\u2019re with him.", "NTA- but am I the only one thinking stepmom wants to eat the treats too. You said she doesn't always have her kids and have no way of knowing when she will have them but that they last 3 or so times the kids haven't gotten their treats. IF she didn't have her kids all of the times it makes me wonder if she didn't ask the kids where hers was (you baked her cake so she knows  how well you bake), and then tell them if they didn't want to share with her and their dad they couldn't have them.", "NTA, but I would say just send enough for all the kids anyways just to be safe", "YTA. Bake them something when they are with you, or bake for everybody, not just your children. Why are you sending them with food, anyway? You expect they won't get fed there? It's insulting to the new wife. People say she's passive-aggressive for the note she sent you, but your sending the kids with food in the bag may be seen as passive-aggressive, too.", "YTA if you\u2019re sending treats with your kids but not enough to share with the other kids in the household. Do you expect stepmom to hand your kids delicious brownies or whatever, and let the other kids just\u2026..watch them eat?", "YTA. You mean well and it comes from a good place, but you should send enough for everyone if you\u2019re sending them with food. Especially when there\u2019s a chance of other kids being there, it just creates unnecessary friction to not send enough for everyone. Their stepmom didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t send it, just to send plenty to share. You don\u2019t need to start drama between all the kids when they\u2019re at their dads. It\u2019s not fair to anyone.", "YTA. Your kids can go a weekend without mommy bakes. Give your ex a chance to treat them. Or send over a dozen to be shared with whoever is around.", "ESH\n\nI get it. You want your kids to have something that reminds them of mommy while they're away so they know and feel loved.  You're a soft a. h.  Send them with a plushy or one of your sweatshirts or something. You're sending just enough ONLY for your kids.  You think if the other CHILDREN (doesn't matter if they're over 12. Kids are kids and they all want love) see your kids eating a brownie they'll not be jealous? I get that they're not your kids and not responsible for them. But a great way to build resentment and animosity is allowing your kids to have treats while other kids look on.  Stop being petty with food.  \n\nHaving said that, wow passive aggressive step mom.  She has kids she should be able to understand your position.  She could've just called and spoke to you like an adult.   She could've just explained and asked you to save their treats for the car ride over or car ride back or ask you if you could make enough for the family.  The whole \"bring enough to share\" note and then saying she'll throw it out is just rude.  \n\nI would either not send any next trip or send enough for everyone. Co parenting is hard enough between the divorced couple. Blending families are even tougher.  Hope the adults can all work together. Take care.", "NTa that is not your kids not your problem to bake with", "It would be a class act if you baked enough for all the kids.  If I was one of those other kids I would worship the ground you walk upon...", "YTA. Send enough to share.", "YTA. Feed them your treats when they are with you. There is no need to be sending food with them to their dad\u2019s house, especially when it\u2019s only for them.", "NTA", "NTA am I the only one seeing that OP doesn\u2019t know when the other kids will be at the dads house?\n\nOP maybe reaching out and telling step mom it was not your intention to exclude the other kids you didn\u2019t know when they were there. Going forward maybe if she tells you the other kids are there you can bake more. However that\u2019s entirely up to you. \n\nId also be asking your ex how the treat thing went down because your kids not telling you originally why makes me feel like stepmom wasn\u2019t nice about it.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t a mind reader and her attitude was rude. You are not her children\u2019s mother and it is perfectly ok for you to expect to be able to send food for your children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its not insulin or their inhaler, its just baked goods. Dessert for 5 kids and possible + 2 adults, is alot. If they don't have enough desserts there, then they don't get desserts. OP is not in charge of their meal planning, and they are not in charge of OP's dessert distribution.\n\nPlus, it'll give OP alittle extra cache of esteem from her kids (not that she needs it, but hey..its nice to have) for when the kids are staying with her.", "Why would OP go out of her way to send treats for her kids knowing it\u2019s her ex\u2019s responsibility to provide for for them while they\u2019re in his care?

She has no responsibility towards those children however if its the ex's wife who has a problem and he doesn't then she should make sure when op's children at there that they are all equally treated and she gives absolutely no special treatment to her own. We don't know if she does or not but otherwise ots very hypocritical and frankly OP doesn't need to change anything that she is doing. Its late for me and I am tired and was tired as hell, if it still doesn't make sense ill fix everything in the morning when I can use my brain fully. I'm running on fumes at the moment.", "If they are having one a day in the week they will obviously see the box of 4 in the same way. While the other kids are old enough not to fight over the cookies, there could still be some tension there.\n\nBy the way, one cookie a day is about enough for a 8 year old, when does your ex husband get to treat them? Does he not deserve to build that connection with them as well?\n\nAt a minimum I would say send nothing 3 weekends and send enough to share the other weekend. But really you should stop sending anything and have a long think about why you can't let the dad's time be just that, dad's time for him to parent them as he chooses.\n\nBy the way, there's a subreddit specifically about coparenting, take a look.", "And to magically have the same treats on hand so no arguments break out among the siblings/step-siblings? What if OP\u2019s kids really want a slice of, say, a cake that stepmom decided to have on hand to avoid treat-related arguments - does she then allow them to also eat the treats that OP sent? There\u2019s no indication in OP\u2019s post that the food she\u2019s sending is due to dietary needs or concerns about the kids not being fed enough when they\u2019re at dad\u2019s house. They\u2019re just treats because they love mom\u2019s baking. But they can go without OP\u2019s treats for two days per fortnight. OP is actually - in a very minor way, admittedly - interfering with dad\u2019s scheduled time."]}
