You are under no obligation to provide baked goods for her kids, especially since they didn't talk to you about it like grown-ups.

It sounds like the situation as it stands is awkward and uncomfortable for your kids, and they are the ones who matter here.", "NAH - Food can be a contentious topic and you sent goodies for your kids to enjoy during their time at their dad's house. You likely did not mean to exclude the kids but it happened. \n\nShe could have been nicer explaining how these treats do not suffice sharing with others. As u/IntrovertedBookMan said, imagine two kids eating an amazing brownie and the other kids have none or 1/5 of one. \n\nYour behavior could be meddling with meal time (ate too many sweets and no room for nutritional food) so consider, when they pack to be a dad's house; let the experience be what is only offered there.", "INFO: how much is enough for \"the two of them to share for the weekend?\" Are you sending just one or two cookies each? Are you expecting them to sneak them late at night if others are around?\n\nTo keep the peace it might be best to send one dozen items.

Heck, she didn't even have to call you; she could have had your ex call you.\n\nCommunicating is what grownups do. Making the kids feel guilty for having snacks sent with them is not. \n\nYou probably didn't even think about the issues not having enough to share might cause. After all, you don't have step kids coming around your place. So now you know. I can see how two of the kids having treats could cause problems with the others. I mean, what kid doesn't want some goodies to munch?

Talk to the ex and see what he says.", "NTA. \"Politely sending them home untouched\" is really passive aggressive and controlling behaviour too. Especially as instead of bringing it up with you, they decided to bring your kids into it. Your kids aren't going to be well equipped to understand how to process this conflict.\n\nThey aren't operating in good faith, and they aren't treating you or your kids with respect. They are using passive aggressive behaviour, and avoiding direct conflict to control people.\n\nAbsolutely shit person bringing children into such a nonsense conflict. If she acts this way around her own kids they are going to need so much therapy.", "NTA - You said you'd have no idea of knowing if her kids will be there or not, fair enough. You could ask but why should you go out of your way to bake for the other kids if you dont know them well. Baking for your own kids is completely reasonable, when she goes to a park and other kids get ice creams and hers don't does she go to the other parents and kindly say \"buy ice-cream for everyone not just your kids\" (bit extreme example but I've read too many of these and am quite done tonight) I'm sure if her ex started giving her kids gifts while your kids were present she wouldn't demand fair treatment for them.", "Info: did you send the goodies with your kids with specific instructions that they are not to be shared with their stepsiblings?", "NTA. There was no need for passive aggression by the new wife.

It sounds like you have good intentions, but sending food with your kids when they go to the other parent's house can come off as passive-aggressive or judgmental, as though you don't believe the other parent is providing for them. If you do want to send a treat every now and then, the polite thing to do is to send enough for everyone. Or just don't. The kids can live without home-baked treats for a couple of days.", "NTA. I think you and your kids\u2019 step mom have different ideas when it comes to etiquette. When your kids go to their dad\u2019s house they are members of that household. I was taught that if you send food for one member of a household, you should supply enough for them to share with everyone who lives there. That\u2019s what my mom does and it\u2019s what my grandmothers did. \n\nThe step mom is wrong for being so passive aggressive but I think this can be easily fixed by calling your ex and trying to come to an understanding. The easiest solution would be to save the \u201cmommy bakes\u201d for when your kids are with you.

Bake them something when they are with you, or bake for everybody, not just your children. Why are you sending them with food, anyway? You expect they won't get fed there? It's insulting to the new wife. People say she's passive-aggressive for the note she sent you, but your sending the kids with food in the bag may be seen as passive-aggressive, too.", "YTA if you\u2019re sending treats with your kids but not enough to share with the other kids in the household. Do you expect stepmom to hand your kids delicious brownies or whatever, and let the other kids just\u2026..watch them eat?", "YTA. You mean well and it comes from a good place, but you should send enough for everyone if you\u2019re sending them with food. Especially when there\u2019s a chance of other kids being there, it just creates unnecessary friction to not send enough for everyone. Their stepmom didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t send it, just to send plenty to share. You don\u2019t need to start drama between all the kids when they\u2019re at their dads. It\u2019s not fair to anyone.", "YTA. Your kids can go a weekend without mommy bakes. Give your ex a chance to treat them. Or send over a dozen to be shared with whoever is around.", "ESH\n\nI get it. You want your kids to have something that reminds them of mommy while they're away so they know and feel loved.  You're a soft a. h.  Send them with a plushy or one of your sweatshirts or something. You're sending just enough ONLY for your kids.  You think if the other CHILDREN (doesn't matter if they're over 12. Kids are kids and they all want love) see your kids eating a brownie they'll not be jealous? I get that they're not your kids and not responsible for them. But a great way to build resentment and animosity is allowing your kids to have treats while other kids look on.  Stop being petty with food.  \n\nHaving said that, wow passive aggressive step mom.  She has kids she should be able to understand your position.  She could've just called and spoke to you like an adult.   She could've just explained and asked you to save their treats for the car ride over or car ride back or ask you if you could make enough for the family.  The whole \"bring enough to share\" note and then saying she'll throw it out is just rude.  \n\nI would either not send any next trip or send enough for everyone. Co parenting is hard enough between the divorced couple. Blending families are even tougher.  Hope the adults can all work together. Take care.", "NTa that is not your kids not your problem to bake with", "It would be a class act if you baked enough for all the kids.

Going forward maybe if she tells you the other kids are there you can bake more. However that\u2019s entirely up to you. \n\nId also be asking your ex how the treat thing went down because your kids not telling you originally why makes me feel like stepmom wasn\u2019t nice about it.", "NTA.

Come on...", "The person above said: \"Not your kids, not your problem\". That's fuck up. If the stepmother use the same argument, op kids will be in a bad situation.\n\nImagine if the stepmother buys ice cream for desert and give only for her children and let ops children watching while they eat. That's OK? So why it's OK for op to send cookies only for her children? Send for everyone or don't send at all.", "I disagree that everyone having the same food all the time means equality.\n\nAlso disagree that having the same food should be more important than all kids feeling (equally) safe and equally treated. Stepmom's own kids hopefully don't pass on passive aggressive notes to their father.\n\nI agree that if the op got a call or text about it that would be completely fine. And it seems like they're on good terms so op could have gotten a call or text.\n\nBut I am interested to hear how you thought the kids felt having the note packed in their bag (as opposed to the note being rude to the op)? No one knows what they were told and how they were treated there for doing nothing wrong themselves. But how did they feel about having to deliver that note?\n\nAnd very interested to hear if you think the kids felt equal having to pass on a rude note to their mother?", "Yes, it's a good comparison, both sets of kids are giving treats by their mother. \n\nIt's rude because while op kids are at\u00e9 ex house the same thing with everyone. Stepmother is not treating the kids differently. Why the hell are you going to make other kids fell left out if you can solve easily by baking a little more cookies? Are you evil? Do you like to me kids fell left out? \n\nWe are talking about a bunch of children. Children that like treats. Not college kids. \n\nNo 2 is stupid. If stepmother treat op kids differently using that argument op would flip. Imagina a post here saying stepmother don't give treats to kids to teach than that you can't alway get what other people are eating. \n\nWe don't know is stepmom said something, maybe she gave the kids other food so they were full and didn't eat the cookies.", "genuinely then why ask????", "She\u2019s probably just sick of hearing her kids complain about the other kids getting treats.\n\nI agree she doesn\u2019t have to cater to them. I\u2019d rather just save the treats for home.", "I don't understand, if she loves baking so much, why she doesn't just send a pie, cake or batch of cookies they could all share and enjoy at their leisure every now and then?  It would be what I would do as long as it was cool with dad and step mom.", "I might miss something here but I don't get how is looking after your own kids is intrusive and exclusionary. Would it be the same if OP could afford better clothes for her kids? Did she have to downplay it and send them in something cheaper instead?\n\nIf current wife has a real problem stemming from this she can either a) deal with it b) talk with OP. You know, while leaving OP's kids out of the conflict.\n\nOP is NTA imo.", "So that everyone is fed the same and it\u2019s not interfering with the scheduling of meals. \n\nWhen kids are hungry they need to eat. If half the kids in the house are hungry and the other half aren\u2019t, it interferes", "Half the kids in the house having a snack when the other half don\u2019t means not everyone is hungry at the same time. Hence, meal times are disrupted.", ">How could an involved parent NOT know, though?\n\nIt took op a week or two to get everything, so the dad may be a step behind regarding this current topic. \n\n>I still think OP shouldn't send baked goods over to her ex's place regularly, because it would definitely disrupt meal planning and possibly the peace, but I'm really curious about the whole dynamic here.\n\nI agree with the idea, but with prior knowledge it can be added to the diet/routine as long as everybody can have some.\n\n>but I'm really curious about the whole dynamic here.\n\nMe too, me too.", "First of all, that made no sense to be honest. The stepmom couldve asked OP over the phone before the kids were sent on their way to make enough goodies for all 5 kids. Instead she decided to be a petty child about it and send a rude note (with a threat) rather than just ask OP to make enough for her kids if they were gonna be there when OPs kids arrived beforehand.\n\nAnd for second, that's a really close minded assumption man. 12 years ago was 2011, one can only imagine how hard it was for this person to come out if they weren't in a welcoming environment. You have no idea why they stayed in the closet for so long, that's a bold assumption saying they did it just to string someone along and lie. The OP doesn't even specifically say she knew the ENTIRE time, things can be taken out of context or twisted around with how it's typed. I'm not a lesbian but unless you are one you can't possibly understand that feeling, like if you were a minority or a transgender person. \n\nYou're definitely insensitive for that. \n\nOP is NTA", "Exactly. Are they low or no contact? Otherwise, what's wrong with giving her a call or text saying \"hey, I'm making cupcakes, how many servings should I send with the girls this weekend?\" Unless it's a money thing, she's a hobby baker, so I can't see it being an inconvenience.", "You can reasonably expect that the friend will be there at the friend's house, so that would be rude. Either way, the friend's parent can still be reasonable in communicating this back to the parent, not being passive aggressive via the children and making them feel bad in the process.\n\nOP has made it clear that it's not at all predictable when the stepmum's kids will be there. This situation is not similar to what you're suggesting as an analogy.", "Because it\u2019s on the one weekend a fortnight when they\u2019re with their other parent. OP can and does share her baking with her kids when they\u2019re with her. Why does it also have to follow them to their dad\u2019s house when - for whatever reason - it\u2019s causing an issue there?", "You don't have to agree. Ask yourself how you would feel in the stepmother's place.", "It\u2019s obviously already causing issues. She should be either sending enough for the whole family to share (if the other kids aren\u2019t there the parents can put the baked good in the freezer or just send them back) or nothing at all. I don\u2019t share custody but I can imagine how mortified I\u2019d be if my kid took one cookie and ate it in front of his step siblings without sharing. \u201cMommy Bakes\u201d and her kids have very poor manners.", "Never said it wasn\u2019t the nice thing to do just said she isn\u2019t obligated to. Besides all the things you listed are needs again it would v e child abuse not. It sounds like op does also give them some baking from time to time just not every weekend because she doesn\u2019t know when they will be there.", "Imagine the stepmom has no idea whether or not OP's kids will be joining her and her children for ice cream *every time* they go for ice cream. Should she buy the ice cream and wait to see if they'll show up, knowing that it might very well melt and be wasted?", "I think it\u2019s intrusive in the sense that OP does not allow dad to decide on the food during the weekends he has the kids, which can imply that she doesn\u2019t think he does a good enough job - kinda like \u201cnow that you\u2019re going to your dad\u2019s, here\u2019s some sweet snacks because he might not give you any / know you want snacks\u201d. So now, if he wants to do something nice for the kids he has to \u201coutdo\u201d the snack she provided. And exclusionary because even if OP doesn\u2019t know when the step siblings are there, they are going to feel excluded on the nice dessert (unless their mom also bakes the other kids, but it seems unfair to put that expectation on them). So even if OP is trying to do a nice thing for her kids, she\u2019s intruding on ex husband\u2019s parenting time.\n\nHowever, based on the note (horrible way of communicating through the kids btw), I guess step mom is not unhappy about OP deciding on the dessert every weekend the kids are over, so perhaps just be better safe than sorry and send more baked goods to keep the peace? ESH", "At the same time OP could have realized there are 5 kid's at ex's house and made enough for 5 kid's, it's the decent thing to do. The other option is not send dessert and let dad and new wife decide what they eat for the weekend. She started this conflict by being short sited", "Well I think unless you were being antagonistic you'd be safer in assuming the other children would be there rather than wouldn't", "Not like I needed to be the passive aggressive AH she was.", "The father is responsible for the kids, not the stepmother,she has no obligation to do anything for op kids, but any good person will treat kids equally when feeding them. Give a treat to one kid and not the other is cruel.\n\nIt's cookies, baking a little more just in case it's not a big deal, even if the kids are not there and the cookies are wasted.", "If the kids are not there than some cookies will be lost, that's not a big deal. What's is worse, throw away some cookies or make children watch while other eat.\n\nOr better, don't send cookies at all. They can survive 2 days without cookies, it's no insulin.", "It's just some cookies, not three days worth of food. If that's enough to cause insecurities on dad's or his wife's part then they have much bigger issues than cookies. Turning some snacks into a competition isn't exactly healthy.\n\nAlso, treating all the kids equally is on them, not on OP. Her priority is her kids, nothing weird about that. Sure, if this is really causing friction between the kids then the right thing to do is to compromise for her children's sake. IF. So far all we know for sure that now-wife isn't happy about the cookies, really.", "This legitimately doesn't sound malicious. Perhaps a little throughtless, but still no reason whatsoever for the stepmum to passive aggressively send little notes and make the kids feel bad without ever communicating with OP. I feel like most people here are in agreement on that?\n\nEven if someone did turn up to a friend's house with their own cakes and didn't have enough for all the friends present, that's something you politely take up with the parent. You don't take it out on the child.", "This is other family time, but if you want to send treats, send enough for all. It's really not that hard.", "Look we obviously aren\u2019t going to agree that\u2019s ok I need to go look after my own kid. But I will leave you with one last thought. The baked treats are more than just a treat it\u2019s a piece of comfort for op\u2019s kids if they miss their mum especially being as young as they are.", "The stepmom should make sure she has treats around to feed her own children.", "Exactly!", "The kids are 9 and 8, they are not toddlers that can't stay 2 days without mama cookies.", "I sure as hell couldn\u2019t at that age hell even now I miss my mum and dads cooking and I am 21 and I miss getting to see them every day. Like I said agree to disagree.", "If you couldn't live 2 days without cookies at the age of 8, you had issues."]}
