I don't sign my name or anything and none of my friends knew I had it until yesterday. \n\nSo one of the posts was titled \" Are people who anthropomorphize animals generally more accepting of people being different?\" followed by: \n\n*\"Quite a few of my friends anthropomorphize and a general observation I've made of them is that they are extremely accepting people. It doesn't matter how odd you are, if you aren't mean they will like you.* \n\n*Like George the cat loves to ping the door stopper because he's a grumpy old man who needs attention but refuses to go near you and Sarah the neighbour has an irrational fear of the doorbell so you only knock when you visit. If an animal can be a bit weird, why can't people be the same, if you get what I mean?*  \n\n*A few of my friends are strongly against it and hate shows like 'Secret life of the zoo' because the keepers there apparently anthropomorphize the animals quite a lot (seriously having a hard time spelling that word) and I've gotten the impression that they are overall quite judgemental people.

That was my post. Ridiculous, but I had to get it out of my brain. It's badly written, not intended to be read whatsoever, just me emptying my brain. \n\nSo to the point, I lent one of my friends my laptop and tumblr was open. She found the post, found it funny (or odd) and sent it to a group chat the girl I mentioned in the last paragraph happened to be in. She, for some reason, knew it was about her and was extremely upset that I wrote something like that about her publicly. \n\nShe said, just because I'm \"stupid enough to talk about animals like they are people\" it doesn't give me the right to slam her online. \n\nI don't even know, honestly, But she is so extremely upset I just don't know if I should appologize?

Where you made mistakes was not password protecting your page if you truly don't want anyone to read it and letting a friend have access to what you consider your private journal. But you're still NTA.\n\nThe friend who borrowed your laptop is the biggest AH for sharing what you consider your private journal in a group chat and the other friend sounds like an AH in general based on both your tumblr post and her response to it. Try to cut her out as best you can and move on.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend who sent it to the group is the asshole. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of the kind of semi-public diarying you were doing, because invariably somebody eventually recognizes something, but you don't take something like that and sent it to a bunch of people saying \"look at what this person wrote.\" \n\nIt honestly also sounds like the upset girl is pretty dramatic. You didn't say anything particularly bad about her, just noted a particular piece of behavior. If she doesn't like the way her behavior sounds when described, that's on her. \n\nI might make a pro-forma apology for the sake of smoothing things over, but the friend who shared it owes you a much bigger one. Does she get how what she did was completely unacceptable?", "NTA!  In fact, your friend should be apologizing to YOU for reading your personal stuff on your laptop!  Not only read it, but DISTRIBUTED IT AND SENT IT TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS?  What fresh hell is THAT?   Don't you dare apologize -- but said friend would forever lose laptop privileges, if she were my friend.  She's a sneaky pot-stirrer.", "NTA, what you wrote was private and not even directly calling out your friend, your friend is the Ahole for sharing something private on your computer", "NTA\nSHES MAD BECAUSE YOU CALLED HER A SH!TTY PERSON \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA she does seem judgmental lol, she really walked into that one.", "I'm a tumblr user since 2012 and NTA. You didn't write anything that could help identify her. Rambling is perfectly normal for that site. Your friend has the right to get offended, like she would be offended if someone else had written the post and you reblogged it. Once again, **you didn't say who this friend was.**\n\nAlso, anthropomorphizing animals, or not doing it, doesn't harm anyone, animals included, unless you use it to take bad decisions (like, say, impose a diet on a pet instead of respecting their specific needs). However, calling someone stupid to their face because you don't agree with them is an insult. \n\nINFO: did the friend you lent your laptop to say it was your tumblr? If so, she is the AH here. At least you know which people aren't actually your friends...", "NTA I think this is a very interesting take and if she is someone who constantly calls people weird and odd then she is an a h", "NTA. You just found out that your premise was pretty accurate, in her case.", "nta and I've been having similar thoughts lately! animal lovers are so accepting of animals' quirks and personalities, surely it leaks into how we can appreciate people's quirks i love that I'm not alone in the odd inner monologue lol", "Soft Y T A For what it's worth, I think your post is a super interesting idea. However, even if you aren't using names, it's passive aggressive to call out a person with identifiers like that. Just write in broader terms.\n\nI am a bit confused: at one point you said it wasn't intended to be read. If that's true, i.e. if you were just writing for yourself and your were going to delete it without posting, then N T A. You can write whatever you want for yourself. My Y T A assumes you were going yo post it.\n\nThe person who shared it without you permission is definitely an AH\n\nEdit: Someone explained that Tumblr is usually anonymous, i.e., even if they posted it, nobody would know OP was the author so nobody would identify the friend. I change my response to NTA. The AH is the person that shared it without permission.", "YTA - Not because you wrote it, but because you aren\u2019t taking responsibility for the hurt that was caused. Regardless of whether you intended for her to ever see it, your friend is now hurt. If she\u2019s truly your friend, apologize. You don\u2019t have to be sorry about writing the post, but you should be sorry that she found out and her feelings were hurt.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Snooper sent it out to several people. Still NTA.", "What identifiers? There is no age, no physical description, no name. OP just shared some comments a person made. If sharing that someone calls people \"odd\" on a regular basis is an identifier, then I'm a flying monkey.", "If I deeply upset someone bc they think women should only wear dresses and I wore pants, do I owe them an apology? If an abuser is deeply upset that you set boundaries to prevent their abuse, do you owe the abuser an apology? Upsetting someone doesn't automatically mean you owe them an apology and it's honestly dangerous to suggest it does.", "No. Because the tumblr posts were supposed to be private like a journal. If someone took screenshots of your deepest, darkest, thoughts from a diary, would you feel responsible to apologize for having thoughts?", "I mean, it's clearly identifying enough that OP's friends knew who it was", "She\u2019s saying that OP should apologize to the friend because the friend is deeply upset by something hurtful that OP wrote about them. She\u2019s not saying that you always have to apologize when someone is upset.", "She knew it was her bc it was calling out her behavior, she knew OP wrote it, and realized it was her own behavior.

Literally no one else on tumblr would be able to ID who OP was talking about.", "and who else beside OP closest friends would know that?\nIt doesnt change anything.", "Yet the point here is that the person who is deeply upset wouldn\u2019t have been aware of OPs thoughts if it weren\u2019t for someone else\u2019s actions.", "Literally not what that comment said, you are making a big inference.", "Ok, so maybe it sounds like I'm misunderstanding the situation.

That person is definitely an AH. But, OP could still apologize that what he wrote hurt the friend (as opposed to apologizing for writing it). His friend is just looking for some acknowledgement of her feelings. It\u2019s perfectly ok to express that you regret that your actions hurt someone you care about\u2026.even if you don\u2019t think the action was wrong.", "That\u2019s funny. I thought the exact same thing about you. Abuser? Who is an abuser in this story? Either way, msjamiefast explicitly references OP\u2019s title\u2026in which OP says that he \u201cupset his friend.\u201d Therefore, no inference is needed. She is sayin that if OP really upset his friend, he should apologize. She not talking about everyone, she\u2019s talking specifically about his friend.", "None of OPs friends would have read her tumblr if the one friend wasn't snooping on her laptop. OP said her tumblr is quasi private and she treats it like a journal. If they came across it just on tumblr's dashboard, they would have no way of knowing OP wrote it or who it was about.", "OP didnt shit-talk, he pointed out a habit that girl has.\n\nNothing more.", "I get that it\u2019s right from your perspective that if someone becomes aware of negative feelings or thoughts you had towards them, apologizing for hurting their feelings is the way to go. Honestly, people like you are the glue that holds society/civilization together. Regrettably, I\u2019m intimately aware of the long-term negative effects of apologizing for my feelings when they were entirely justified.", "My point, which clearly flew over your head since you also mistakenly thought my examples were drawn from the post apparently, is that an apology is only needed if you think the friend's reaction is appropriate. Referencing the title only and ignoring the content and context of the post doesn't make for a good judgement. Going on the title alone and demanding an apology just bc someone was hurt is a bad call imo and I used examples to point out why.", "I wouldn't call reading something that was left open on a laptop I was using \"snooping.\"", "OP literally called her judgmental", "You\u2019re very aggressive. Lol. Your example changes the context, so it\u2019s not a great example. Apologizing to a friend is very different than apologizing to an abuser. You created a straw man to knock down. My point was just telling u that you misunderstood (or at least mischaracterized) msjamiefast\u2019s point. She wasn\u2019t talking about apologizing to everyone or even abusers. She was just saying that OP should apologize to his friend who was hurt. OP acknowledges in the post that his friend is hurt, so no one is ignoring the content post. You don\u2019t have to agree.", "Thank you for advertising that no one should lend you their laptop \ud83d\ude02", "So, if someone left a letter addressed to them somewhere you could access & read it, it\u2019s fair game?", "thats not shit talking", "The real lesson here is to close any private windows before you lend someone your laptop lol", "So like, say they invited me into their room, and on their desk was an open letter. Yeah I think that's fair game. How would I know it was meant to be private?", "How about because it\u2019s not addressed to you? Being allowed into a personal space doesn\u2019t give you automatic rights to dig through that space, read anything you fancy, just because it\u2019s there. No matter what you found by snooping, you would still be an asshole for sharing private information beyond those walls.\n\nWhat\u2019s your problem here? Are you the maligned friend or someone who snoops where they shouldn\u2019t?"]}
