I was lucky enough to be right at the front. \n\nNow, as you might be aware, right at the front of the stage is not the place in the venue with the most space. People weren't exactly crammed in, but were definitely close together. Now, me and my friends were closer to one side of the stage rather than the middle, and there was some more space closer to the wall but not where we were standing.\n\nSo anyway, there was a woman who decided that this was a great location to headbang. She had hair down past her shpulders, and was bent over, properly giving it her all. She was right behind me, and kept headbutting me and hitting me with her hair - she was also hitting other people in front of her with her hair but continued to headbang. Because of how closely the crowd was standing together, I was unable to move further away from her and since I had a spot at the front, I didn't want to move back. I think it's worth mentioning that nobody else was headbanging like this, because there just was not space. Everybody was vigorously nodding - and this one woman bent over at 90 degrees headbanging.\n\nI had had enough of this after the first 10 minutes but I waited until the band had finished because I didn't want to be a total arse and talk to her while the band was playing (a 1 hour set) to ask her to please not headbang like that when standing in such a crowded area and that she clearly had no consideration for the people standing near ber, because she would be able to tell that she was hitting them. She got really angry, and said I wasn't entitled to speak on behalf of the other people in the vicinity. The people in the vicinity agreed with me that being headbutted by her wasn't really fun for them.\n\nThe woman stormed off, clearly in a huff. My friends were split on it, some saying that she was being inconsiderate and others saying that obviously there would be headbanging at a heavy metal gig.\n\nSo what is the verdict? I'll take my judgement.\n\nTLDR: AITA for asking a woman to stop headbanging at a metal gig because she was headbutting me?\n\nNB: There were no mosh pits allowed in this venue, and I would guess the woman was about 40, if that matters. This was the during the opening band of 3 bands and I didn't want 3 more hours of being headbutted.", "created_utc": 1675458609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10svd3d/aita_for_asking_a_woman_to_stop_headbanging_at_a/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But the fact that she was the only one and they had a no mosh pit rule, I think NTA. \n\nIt would be different if she was head banging in her own space, but if you\u2019re gonna keep hitting people then you need to find a more open area. And the fact that randos around you agreed, I think you probably did the venue a service lol", "NTA. I'm a bit of a metal head myself and I would be pissed off if I was headbutted and hair whipped for a full hour. Only headbang when there is space.", "NTA, and getting whipped by hair constantly kinda hurts. If she wasn\u2019t touching you I\u2019d say let her be, but I\u2019m not going to be whipped without a few words being said", "I can't stand rude headbanging, lol. NTA. I had one woman take my drink out of my hand and take a swig! Pissed! I'm female, over 50, and still love metal shows. Who did you see? I'm seeing Fleshgod Apocolypse, Powerwolf, and Orbit Culture (love love love!!!) opening for Avatar so far this year.", "NTA\n\nIf it was annoying you and others, it\u2019s reasonable for you to ask her to stop. \n\nSome people have this thing about concerts where they feel like any behaviour is justified because you shouldn\u2019t want to ruin somebody\u2019s fun, but if she\u2019s *headbutting* you, then that\u2019s going to ruin your experience, so it\u2019s fair for you to ask her to stop.", "YTA. You went to a heavy metal concert, went to the front (where headbanging is generally encouraged), and complained to someone about their headbanging. If you want a chiller section, go hang out with the other old heads in the back.", "The front row of a metal concert is literally THE place to headbang.... I find it a little concerning that no one else was doing it. What's happening with metal shows!?", "NTA. \"The right for you to wave your fist stops where my face begins.\" Well, in this case... the right for her to headbang stops with her hair hitting you lol. The headbanging wasn't the issue, it was her hitting other people in the process", "NTA - getting bumped and such in the front row is to be expected, but this was too much.  She needed to 'read the room.'", "NTA\n\nI think terminology here is important.\n\nAsking someone to stop headbanging or dancing at a concert is generally going to be an asshole move - that is often just a natural reaction to live music.\n\nAt the same time, 'please stop bumping into me' is a pretty reasonable request - as you said, you had no problem with anyone being into the music or dancing reasonably, just the flailing and getting bumped into regularly.\n\nSometimes it is inevitable and your have to just accept it - when a mosh pit happens down near the front of a metal gig and you are standing between them and the stage, yeah, you probably are going to have someone land on you and that is just the risk you are accepting to get a spot at the front. But not every gig is like that - if there is only one dancer and they keep bumping you while the rest of the crowd is respectful then it is not cool.", "NTA. I\u2019m a woman in my forties. I enjoy heavy metal. I\u2019ve been know to headbang. Repeatedly hitting others without their consent isn\u2019t OK. It\u2019s assault.", "YTA the front is for the hardcore, you should have moved to the back if you wanted tranquil listening space.", "ESH\n\nShe should have displayed a little more self awareness, but also, it's a metal concert. If you don't wanna deal with that shit, don't go to the front.", "NTA. Hair whipped in your eyeballs is never fun. Especially when it isn't your own hair.", "NTA. Unwanted contact from another person during a concert is not cool.", "YTA. You're up front at a metal concert", "You sound absolutely ridiculous with your sad complaint. Go see emo bands. YTA", "ESH, there's always someone that bangs at concerts regardless of venue and crowd size.  So, YTA for being a bit of a whine bag (hello, metal show, it's something you'll have to deal with). And she's TA for not taking in consideration what a tight space she was in and encroaching on others.  I've been to many a metal show and ended up in a pit more than once.  There are things you just have to expect, and someone headbanging is one of them.", "NTA", "NTA, assuming you asked nicely and weren't a dick about it.

She should have found a less crowded spot to do it.

Tip though: when giving feedback, try to use an approach focused on your experience, rather than focused on judging their actions. Your feedback could then have been something like: \n\n'I felt upset and disrespected when you hit me with your hair and head during the set, as it caused me physical discomfort and impacted my enjoyment of the music. If you enjoy headbanging, would you please ensure you don't hit me when you do it?'\n\nYou're much more likely to get an 'oh I'm so sorry' out of them using this approach than the judgemental one you took. Your approach created resistance and defensiveness because it was accusatory and judgemental. Of course, even the approach above isn't a cast iron guarantee!", "NTA. At The Weeknd concert last year the last next to me was wasted and dancing BIG and singing and all that. Bumped into me a couple of times. Dude she was with was doing his best to contain her lol and they seemed nice otherwise. It was a bit annoying but ok. I know I\u2019ve been drunk and wild before. I would have probably been pissed in your situation though - that lady obviously had zero regard for others and I\u2019m grossed out by her hair hitting you.", "That's what I thought tbh. No way you can headbutt people and hit them with your hair for an hour and not know you're doing it.", "There wasn't space to bend over and headbang like that, though.", "Even though literally nobody else was bent over?", "The Weeknd concert and a metal show are wildly different places", "Right unless she was totally wasted, in which case she\u2019d still be the AH for being in public when she doesn\u2019t have enough control over her actions to not be a nuisance lol", "This is very non-metal of you", "That\u2019s a totally fair point in terms of reasonable expectation and voluntary exposure to risk or annoyance, but (i) OP actually put up with it for the entire set before saying anything and (ii) nobody else was head banging, so it seems like that wasn\u2019t the norm at this particular show for whatever reason. I don\u2019t think it was inappropriate for OP to point out that her harmful conduct was inconsiderate.", "I know.", "NTA", "Heavy metal concert? Front row? That\u2019s for headbanging. You make space for the headbangers. There used to be a row of people holding the crowd back, and people would take it in turns to head bang in the space. Guess that doesn\u2019t happen any more.", "YTA this is a metal gig if you don't like it take your ass home or sit in the back with the people who aren't throwing down. And as far as a non pit venue? They always say that and we never care.", "no part of my brain can process not EXPECTING lots of headbanging at a metal show.  \n\n\nI. just. can't.", "NTA. If people are actually complaining about headbanging in a metal concert. It must've been some absurd level of headbanging, probably like never seen before.", "YTA, it\u2019s head banging, especially at no mosh venues, it\u2019s like the main way to feel in with the music", "ESH.

A button, zipper......or fist.", "But she was in the second row and beating people with her hair in a no mosh pit concert. Different story if she was all the way in the front and not hitting people with her hair and head too!", "Yeah you can. I was at an Anthrax concert and totally ruined Lemmy\u2019s latte.

My hair gets caught in my watch strap regularly, I\u2019d just put my arm in the thrash zone, lock my elbow so I don\u2019t get caught up in the movement and let her get tangled.", "Bahahahaha that's the best type of plan. Plausible innocence. \nMine gets caught on everything.  It can't be longer than boob length or it gets caught in my armpits 10,000x a day. Most infuriating feeling on the planet. I probably would have just done a few up and downs with my arms and she'd have been sorry for sure."]}
