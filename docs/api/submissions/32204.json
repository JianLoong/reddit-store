We work far away from home and wanted to pick up from the location closest to our house. When choosing a location, the app only showed a list of addresses instead of a map. There was only 1 location on the street name I was looking for, but the distance didn\u2019t seem right, so I pulled up my maps app to find the address of the one I was looking for. When comparing the addresses on the app vs maps, they had different address #s, and one said 22miles away, while the other said 13 miles away. This was confusing to me, so I decided to ask what she thought about it. I started saying \u201cThis is is what\u2019s confusing to me, in the app it says the address is \u20181234\u2019 and the distance is 13 miles, but in maps it says-\u201c and then she interrupted me in an annoyed tone saying \u201cDo you just want me to maps it for you!?\u201d My face went deadpan and I calmly said \u201cI\u2019d like for you to listen to what I\u2019m saying.\u201d This caused her to start freaking out and acting like I was causing a scene. She was extremely upset about \u201cthe way I was talking to her in front of other people\u201d (there were 2 other people in the room, about 5 feet away, but I only spoke loud enough for my SO to hear me) I didn\u2019t, and still don\u2019t see a problem with my reaction. Am I in the wrong? Is it not reasonable to appear annoyed when someone interrupts you?\n\nArgument 2 occurred at home just now. We were sitting on the couch and she showed me a TikTok that reminded me of something that happened at work yesterday. I started talking, and again, she interrupted me to ask a question that I was a few words away from answering. Again, my face went deadpan. Again, she got very upset about my reaction. She says that I don\u2019t understand how mean I look when do that, but I feel like it is a reasonable, measured response. It feels like she is refusing to acknowledge that her behavior was rude, and it seems unreasonable to expect to like the way someone responds to you being rude to them. What should I do?\n\nTLDR: When interrupted by a question I was already answering, my face and voice become deadpan.

I know an interrupter like this and it's one reason I cut back on hanging out with him. Your reaction is perfect, communicating you have a problem, but w/o yelling and screaming. You obviously hit a nerve since she got so defensive. Interrupting is a habit hard to break; consider if you want to be w/someone who's always going to be doing that.", "NTA.

My ex used to do that and when Id say 'Please let me finish' he would say 'but I already know what you are going to say'. It was SO very rude.\n\nI dont think a deadpan face is rude at all. However, it bothers her ALOT so I would chat with her and say that the way she feels when you make a deadpan face, is the same way you feel when she cuts across your sentence and interrupts.\n\n(btw interrupting someone mid sentance is an action. Deadpan face is a reaction to that action. Its two different things)\n\nSo perhaps you can have a 'code' word when you each are doing what the other dislikes. When she interrupts you, you could say 'bingo' (or whatever you two decide) which should clue her in that she once again interrupted you. And if you do a deadpan face, she can do the same.\n\nIf she doesnt like that idea or if she isnt willing to work with you on this, then next time she interrupts you, I would say 'wow! did you just interrupt me in the middle of my sentence??\" and if you are in public I would definitely say it loud enough for everyone to hear and when she says you demeaned her or embarrassed her in front of her friends, the response is 'actually you did that to yourself'. And then carry on with the rest of the sentence.\n\nSometimes people dont realise they are doing it (interrupting). Sometimes they do and just dont care. I dont know about your partner, however no matter the intent, its still really rude.", "NTA.

It doesn't matter if it's fair, or if it's a misunderstanding, or whatever. If you dismiss it instead of engaging with it at all, you are telling her that you don't treat her feelings as valid. \"Well, you did something I found rude,\" isn't an argument in that case either, unless you want your argument to be, \"if you do something rude I don't have to care about your feelings!\"\n\nI would say NTA, but talk about both you being overly sensitive to being interrupted and her being overly sensitive to feeling belittled.

I\u2019m currently in the process of trying to communicate with her about this, but unfortunately, it\u2019s not going very well at all. I agree that it would be better to focus on finding a better way to navigate these situations than focusing on who\u2019s right or wrong. The issue I\u2019m currently facing however is: because she feels so certain that she is right and I am wrong, she does not seem willing to give me the empathy and understanding necessary for us to find a compromise. She believes she has undiagnosed ADHD and is sending me articles citing how it can be hard for people with ADHD not to interrupt. I told her I am willing to be more understanding of her interrupting if she can be more understanding that it negatively effects me when it happens, but she just said I\u2019m holding her accountable for something she can\u2019t control.

Your wife is being rude and disrespectful. I'm sure she doesn't mean to be. Just as your expression on your face is not intended to be mean. You're annoyed and frustrated and rightfully so. A sour look on your face is still a better response than what could potentially fly out of your mouth that you can't easily take back. Please ask her what she would prefer. A sour look?

Perhaps she was just excited to show you something and whilst you were commenting, this excitement caused her to blurt out a question that you admit she didn't know you were answering as you were \"setting it up\". It's a style of communication between people who know each other well. They interupt each other with similar thoughts/ideas/questions and it usually gets animated when they realize they're on the same track (lots of \"ya\", \"I know\", \"exactly\" and other interjections involved). Most people in my family do this. After she interrupted with her question you could have said \"Ya, I was just about to answer that!\" in an agreeable tone, and continued to answer it.\n\nMy brother, the outlier, despises being interrupted and will pull the dead pan face and stop talking or even continuing his statement when asked. My gut reaction to that is \"get over yourself\". It very much gives off the vibe of arrogance and is also rude. As though you disdain the other person and what you have to say is so important, you should be listened to as if you were a god. This reaction should be saved for strangers or people you are not invested in.\n\nIf you care for someone, you should correct gently, with patience. My husband has become used to my family's style but when it gets to be too much for  him, he will gently say, \"If you would let me finish\" (or some other phrase). There is no anger, maybe a touch of annoyance but that immediately prompts an, \"I'm sorry, go on\". We interrupters just really like to bond over conversation. It's a deep seated quirk and really hard to break as it's a communication style. In my experience it seems to be most common with second to last born children.

It's incredibly stupid.

Seems like girlfriend doesn\u2019t see a problem with her behavior otherwise she would start apologizing when you seem irritated (which when you interrupt someone that makes sense).", "NTA I hate being interrupted. It is so incredibly rude. The person doing the interrupting certainly must be thinking \"what I have to say is more important\". At the very least, it indicates that the person you are talking to is not listening to you. This is the one thing that anyone who knows me knows how offensive I find it.

Unfortunately, your suggestion to call her out in public would definitely not work. While it was interrupting that started the argument, most of the argument has actually been about arguing in public. It\u2019s something that has happened a handful of times throughout our relationship, and I am at a total loss on how to deal with it. \n\nBasically what happens is there will be some kind of minor unpleasant interaction between us (usually something similar to this story, where she does or says something that bothers me, but then doesn\u2019t like my reaction), but she will interpret it as something much bigger and treat it as if it was obvious to everyone in the room. She\u2019ll start doing things that she thinks are discreet but actually call more attention to us and instead of it just being 1 unpleasant interaction, now it\u2019s an argument. She\u2019ll insist on arguing with me over text as if it isn\u2019t obvious when 2 people are sitting next to each other texting back and forth. We end up in these situations where she is mad that we are arguing in public, but is also doing all the things that are making it be an argument to begin with. She\u2019s upset that she feels like we are attracting attention, while handling it in a way that attracts more attention. The times that this has happened have been some of the most frustrating times in our relationship, because I ALSO don\u2019t want to be arguing in public, but I am ok with handling disagreements in a healthy way in public (just like I would with a coworker or anyone else). However, when I try to do that, she will start shushing me and telling me I\u2019m making a scene (which is actually making a scene)", "I could never say something like that where I\u2019m comparing her to others in a negative way.

It seems like basic human social interaction, right? Reciprocity: you do things I like, so I\u2019ll do things you like. Also the inverse: you don\u2019t do things I don\u2019t like, so I won\u2019t do things you don\u2019t like (implying: if you do things I don\u2019t like, I might do things you don\u2019t like) People aren\u2019t born automatically knowing what everyone else likes and doesn\u2019t like, so we have ways of communicating that and learning. Here\u2019s the conflicting part: some people on here have said (and depending on the circumstance, they\u2019re not wrong) that that would be \u201ctraining\u201d my SO. I think that the idea of training my SO sounds disgusting, as we should see each other as equals. Where it gets tricky, is that: in a situation where one person is communicating that they don\u2019t like something the other person did, there is a power dynamic. The person expressing dissatisfaction is slightly putting themselves in a position of power or authority over the other person. I think this is ok and normal as long as it\u2019s only happening in situations where boundaries are being crossed. It\u2019s only toxic if it\u2019s like that all the time. \n\nEdit: sorry, I just noticed I didn\u2019t really answer your question. So the argument started with the interruption and the deadpan reaction, but then quickly became about \u201chow I was treating her in public\u201d. I explained in another comment how she is very sensitive to less-than-ideal interactions between us in public. It quickly becomes a vicious cycle where we are arguing with each other about how we don\u2019t want to be arguing in public. A big part of why the deadpan reaction comes out in those situations is because TO ME, that seems very discreet. Along with my face becoming neutral, my voice was also a lot softer. Based on past experience, I think saying \u201cyou interrupted me\u201d in a \u201cnormal\u201d voice/tone would probably be perceived as attracting just as much unwanted attention.", "I really like your suggestion of \u201cyeah, I was just about to answer that!\u201d In an agreeable tone. That is the suggestion that brain was looking for because for some reason I couldn\u2019t come up with it myself. \n\nJust wanted to clarify in case it wasn\u2019t clear. The 2nd argument also wasn\u2019t really ABOUT interrupting. It wasn\u2019t me getting mad at her for interrupting, it was her getting mad at me for the facial expression I made when it happened. I felt forced to point out her interruption as a defense for my face. \n\nShe also brought up how MY family talks over each other all the time and I don\u2019t get mad at them. My response was:\n1. It does bother me how they talk over each other all the time, even if I don\u2019t confront them about it. (And to be fair, I\u2019m not being confrontational here either, she is)\n\n2.They do that in a group setting, but wouldn\u2019t in a 1on1 conversation, and if they did, they would quickly apologize if I reacted that way, not get defensive and fault me for not liking it.", "Thank you for your response, but I don\u2019t think what you said really applies to this situation. With the cookie situation, we had been sitting in silence for a few minutes while she was on TikTok and I was trying to figure things out myself before asking for her help. The first words out of my mouth were exactly what I typed in the post, and she was that quick to interrupt me. The fact that she asked the question she asked after I just said the words \u201cbut on maps it says\u201d shows that she was not listening and in fact did not know what I was about to say. The interruption on the couch happened while I was still setting up the story I was about to tell. She didn\u2019t know where I was going with it (which is why she interrupted), but she wasn\u2019t expected to know where I was going yet because I was still setting up the story.", "I\u2019d love to try something like this. Unfortunately, she has a serious aversion to being treated like a child, and having a talking piece is literally something we do with the kids at the school we work at. However, we might be at a point where I just have to ask her to seriously consider setting that aside and using this strategy. Maybe saying something like, \u201cI know you don\u2019t like feeling like you\u2019re being treated like a child, however, because we\u2019ve been having trouble communicating, I think using a talking piece when we are having a disagreement would be a good idea for us,\u201d will work?", "No, she showed me something, I watched it and engaged with it, THEN continued the conversation by saying \u201cthat reminds me of something that happened yesterday.\u201d If she had more to say about the TikTok, she never expressed that. She was only upset at my reaction when she interrupted me mid sentence. I did no interrupting in this scenario, especially because of what happened yesterday, I\u2019m trying to avoid doing that.", "Is anger not allowed to be communicated? My point of view is that being dead pan is the most mild way to communicate anger, which made me think it was healthy. I can tell you disagree that it is a healthy response. What would be a better one?", "Thank you for your response! Not trying to be defensive, but I\u2019m a little confused by some things you said.

I\u2019m saying that my somewhat positive demeanor changed to neutral as a natural reaction to being interrupted, as opposed to getting mad and escalated. I wasn\u2019t doing some kind of bit or something. I became upset and my facial expression changed as a result. She wasn\u2019t trying to connect with what I was saying because she wasn\u2019t even listening.

Your response is very emotional and makes me think you didn\u2019t fully read or understand the post. I\u2019m stupid for using the store\u2019s app to place an order? I used maps myself to try to verify I was ordering from the correct location before trying to ask her how I should interpret my findings. Why is \u201cinterrupted\u201d in quotes? Are you mocking me for not liking being interrupted, as if it\u2019s some weird sensitivity only I have? Judging from the rest of the responses to this post, my sensitivity to being interrupted seems to be much more relatable than her sensitivity to my facial expression. The irony of the author of this comment calling me a dick is not lost on me either. I would have loved to have been able to correct her and continue the conversation, however my natural annoyed reaction was enough to set her off and cause an argument instead.", "Apologizing quicker is something I\u2019ve been asking her to do, but she says she cannot say it if she doesn\u2019t mean it, and explaining to her why she should be sorry doesn\u2019t make her want to apologize, it makes her want to retreat and withdraw or get angry. I would love if little hiccups like an accidental interruption could be treated as hiccups, but that only happens if the transgressor can quickly acknowledge their wrongdoing and apologize. A lot of our arguments happen because she will make some sort of minor transgression against me, and then when I point it out and ask her not to do that, she gets offended and plays the victim because now I\u2019m attacking her. When she feels attacked, she will not apologize, which makes me want to push the issue. I know I need to work on this, but it\u2019s difficult because I care more about the fact that she won\u2019t own up to what she did than the thing she did in the first place.

You are repeatedly rude and disrespectful and it needs to stop. I am going to continue to respond in this way if you continue to fail to correct your behavior. Your behavior is far more rude than my response, which is warranted.\"\n\nShe will likely flip out. Be dismissive of her feelings and constantly shift it back to what she did wrong, not how SHE FEELS about the whole thing. This is the only way to shut people like this down, as they view things only through their own solipsistic lens and will not correct their behavior until their back is against the wall in the form of 100% negative feedback to their actions during and \"feelings\" after the fact.\n\nLet her know that her not interrupting and behaving properly is more important than her feelings about your response.", "I can understand why you would feel that way, so another option is to not go deadpan when she interrupts you but wait until she is finished and bring up your issues with her behaviour then. That way it has only just happened but she isn't already on the offensive and claiming that you are being rude and if you tell her how you feel about the situation in a calm manner, she can't turn the situation around by accusing you of being cold or rude in return. It also demonstrates that you are willing to let her finish what she is saying rather than interrupting her and would like the same courtesy in return. Your girlfriend's inability to take criticism is also something that needs to be addressed at some point since she is obviously comfortable with accusing you of being rude if you do something she doesn't like but you apparently don't get the luxury of bringing up hurtful or rude behaviour of hers in the same/a more healthy way.", "Ah gotcha.\n\nOk, then I would suggest when something happens in public, you tell her that you arent going to discuss it further until you get home. If she sends you texts to argue her point, just ignore them. She will either continue texting and getting more angry or she will get the 'hint' and stop.\n\nIts a bit like dealing with a child in public who is being unruly or having a tantrum.

As I said, save the dead pan for strangers or those you have no invested interest in. I also realize that this is part of your communication style (your quirk) and won't be easy to control. Maybe you two need to have a discussion about your communication styles. You could let her know that when you dead pan, it's not anger or disdain, but maybe just a reset for your frustration? You could both agree to work on finding more compatible ways to communicate or maybe you could agree to call out each others quirks in a joking manner to alleviate the stress of the moment and avoid hurt feelings. Good luck!", "But you are getting annoyed.  You are simply using the deadpan face to express that annoyance as disapproval.  So, this is one reason why it might be better to just have a separate conversation about it and let her know this pisses you off.  Instead, you are trying to train her to stop doing it.  I would just set aside time to have a serious discussion about it. \n\nA lot of people on this thread have offered you different advice.

So, I guess this is a matter of \u201cdo you want to be right, or do you want a solution to the problem\u201d?

Frankly, it seems like she needs to grow up, as she's acting like a child and dodging responsibility for her actions. That may sound harsh, but I think at this point she's taking advantage of being able to trump your feelings with hers so she can 'win' the argument.\n\nIt's very clear that you're willing to work on yourself, but nothing will change if she isn't willing to work on herself.

This no-tolerance hard ass kind of approach seems appropriate for normal people, but I don\u2019t think it should be that way with your partner. Like your advice to dismiss her feelings might sound fair, but if I followed it, I would feel like such a horrible partner myself! I don\u2019t think we are going to learn to love each other better by treating each other badly, but then that begs the question: how do you enforce boundaries? Whenever I try to talk to her about how her actions affect me, I often get accused of not caring about how she feels. (Often, the situation is: I DO care about your feelings, HOWEVER your feelings don\u2019t excuse your actions). This sometimes escalates into \u201cThis is why we just shouldn\u2019t be together! I (she) should just be alone!\u201d And then I\u2019m left thinking \u201chuh?

Someone else here also referred to my reaction as \u201ctraining\u201d and to be totally honest, I resent that because my reaction is not planned or intentional. It\u2019s my completely natural, genuine response to what\u2019s happening in the moment. We work at a school, and it\u2019s a reaction that happens with the students probably 100 times a day, making it very ingrained at this point (not saying it\u2019s ok, just that it\u2019s not manipulative like I feel your interpreting it as). I\u2019ll be explaining something and then someone will blurt out asking a question I either just answered or was about to answer. I don\u2019t want to be seen as cold or harsh, but I also don\u2019t want to be walked all over, and being a teacher has helped me try to find that balance. I was the nice teacher who wanted all the kids to like me when I first started, and I quickly learned that didn\u2019t earn me their respect. I\u2019ve had issues with being too much of a people pleaser in the past and have been on a journey for many years trying to find that balancing point where I can be as nice as possible while still enforcing boundaries.\n\nIn response to your second paragraph, I swear I\u2019m not just looking for vindication for my current strategy.

I feel it warrants a sit-down talk.", "People are so used to me being quiet that they tend to get upset when I try to be heard because I sound \"angry\". I'm very conflict-averse so I guess I was hoping for a subtle way to go about it, but it makes sense that I'm just going to have to suck it up :T", "We just finished listening to Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus together a few days ago and both really liked it! Idk if that\u2019s where you got the idea of the letter, but that book describes in great detail how to write a love letter during a disagreement. I think it would be beneficial for us, because I\u2019m often not able to get complete thoughts out when we argue. I don\u2019t like arguing over text because it feels very tedious, but I have definitely noticed that she seems to \u201chear\u201d me a lot better when we do, so maybe we need to start moving our disagreements into written word.\nI think we could definitely benefit from couple\u2019s counseling. She often argues in ways that are unfair, and it would be really helpful for her to get \u201ccalled out\u201d by someone who isn\u2019t me. We are almost to a place financially where we could start looking into it. I\u2019d really like to try to resolve our differences on our own though if possible!", "Well either suck it up or adapt, walking away avoids the conflict but isn't subtle, continuing to talk is subtle but will probably lead to conflict. If it's friends who accuse you of sounding angry for copying their volume then you need new friends. If it's colleagues then you don't choose your colleagues so you'll have to find a way to fix it that works for you.", "That's not a good book tbh. If you want something that's actually going to help you and it's based in valid science, look at any of the work coming out of the Gottman Institute. The entry book is 7 principles for making marriage work. There are Gottman trained therapists who can guide you through applying the research backed approaches to your relationship as well as a bunch of workbooks and other resources. \n\nIt sounds like you're trying to maturely discuss issues, she's disregarding your feelings and needs and playing the victim, and you're left unheard and with a lot of unmet needs. \n\nObviously there may be more to the story than you're sharing, but based on your comments and not wanting to be petty with her, my guess is that you're more emotionally mature and you're the one making most of the compromises here. I did the same thing and wasted ten years with someone who turned out to be abusive. It started with almost verbatim the kinda of deflections and defensiveness you've described here. If she can't engage without defensiveness, there's no path to resolution or a healthy relationship. \n\nIdeally get into individual therapy as well as couples therapy. Maybe see if your work has an employee assistance program that can help you with your own boundaries so you can navigate this more effectively. \n\nYou're NTA and there are some red flags here that you need to really reflect on before deciding whether to continue in this relationship", "Sometimes I have to interrupt because the person talking at me won't ever quit talking. Like if they were writing comments, the comments would be really long and repeating, repeating. There are certain people who ramble on and on and on saying really nothing the entire time until you finally snap and say, \u201cDo you just want me to maps it for you!?\u201d just to shut them the fuck up.\n\neta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfqcm3Ij9I4", "Obviously, some adults *do* need to be taught this.  And since OP is in a situation with someone who clearly needs to learn this, it isn\u2019t a bad idea to approach it this way.", "Thank you for your response and recommendations! We will definitely check out the sources you suggested. She is very into self help/improvement type things, so I think she will be interested. I recognize the red flags, but I also know that a relationship takes work and am torn between these two ideas. She\u2019s not perfect, but no one is, and I don\u2019t expect her to be. Even with all the issues we still have, I know she\u2019s the one because she HAS been able to make progress in places she\u2019s tried to improve on. The issue I\u2019m facing is convincing her to focus specifically on the things I\u2019m asking her to, instead of just whatever is easiest.", "Ok, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. I\u2019m pretty introverted and like to only say what needs to be said. She is very outgoing and is often very long winded. I feel like you were trying to take her side, but just ended up pointing out to me that another reason this is frustrating is because I listen to her go on and on all the time without interrupting and she can\u2019t even let me get a sentence out sometimes.", "Stay away from anything written by John Grey (Men are from Mars) or Gary Chapman (Love Languages).", "I don't think that you two are compatible, just by the way that you converse. I couldn't be with you if you talked the same way you write because you use way too many words to say a simple statement LOL! If you are concise and succinct in speech, and she is interrupting just because she likes the sound of her own voice, then telling her to not interrupt will fall on deaf ears. She's probably not going to change, so you might want to decide how much of a problem this is."]}
