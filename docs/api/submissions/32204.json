{"id": 32204, "submission_id": "1897eb0", "title": "AITA for having a deadpan reaction when someone interrupts me to ask a question I was in the process of answering?", "selftext": "My SO (31F) and I (32M) have gotten into the same argument 2 days in a row because she keeps interrupting me and doesn\u2019t like my reaction, which to me seems completely appropriate. \n\nArgument 1: We were in the break room at work taking our lunch break when we remembered that we wanted to order Crumbl Cookie to pick up on the way home. We work far away from home and wanted to pick up from the location closest to our house. When choosing a location, the app only showed a list of addresses instead of a map. There was only 1 location on the street name I was looking for, but the distance didn\u2019t seem right, so I pulled up my maps app to find the address of the one I was looking for. When comparing the addresses on the app vs maps, they had different address #s, and one said 22miles away, while the other said 13 miles away. This was confusing to me, so I decided to ask what she thought about it. I started saying \u201cThis is is what\u2019s confusing to me, in the app it says the address is \u20181234\u2019 and the distance is 13 miles, but in maps it says-\u201c and then she interrupted me in an annoyed tone saying \u201cDo you just want me to maps it for you!?\u201d My face went deadpan and I calmly said \u201cI\u2019d like for you to listen to what I\u2019m saying.\u201d This caused her to start freaking out and acting like I was causing a scene. She was extremely upset about \u201cthe way I was talking to her in front of other people\u201d (there were 2 other people in the room, about 5 feet away, but I only spoke loud enough for my SO to hear me) I didn\u2019t, and still don\u2019t see a problem with my reaction. Am I in the wrong? Is it not reasonable to appear annoyed when someone interrupts you?\n\nArgument 2 occurred at home just now. We were sitting on the couch and she showed me a TikTok that reminded me of something that happened at work yesterday. I started talking, and again, she interrupted me to ask a question that I was a few words away from answering. Again, my face went deadpan. Again, she got very upset about my reaction. She says that I don\u2019t understand how mean I look when do that, but I feel like it is a reasonable, measured response. It feels like she is refusing to acknowledge that her behavior was rude, and it seems unreasonable to expect to like the way someone responds to you being rude to them. What should I do?\n\nTLDR: When interrupted by a question I was already answering, my face and voice become deadpan. Is that a reasonable reaction, or am I being mean?", "created_utc": 1701534833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1897eb0/aita_for_having_a_deadpan_reaction_when_someone/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is being rude by not letting you finish what you were saying.  What other reaction would she accept?  Does she see her rudeness in this?  You both are missing the point the other person is trying to make because you are defending your position.  There isn\u2019t much you can do when someone interrupts you other than just shutting up or raising your voice which is considered just as rude.", "NTA. I know an interrupter like this and it's one reason I cut back on hanging out with him. Your reaction is perfect, communicating you have a problem, but w/o yelling and screaming. You obviously hit a nerve since she got so defensive. Interrupting is a habit hard to break; consider if you want to be w/someone who's always going to be doing that.", "NTA. At least you don't say something like, \"B\\*tch I'm *trying* to tell you.\"", "NTA\n\nI, too, hate being constantly interrupted. And you aren't blowing up on her, just expressing in a flat tone that you wish to not be interrupted.\n\nAccording to some others here, the fact that she said she had a negative feeling about you doing that apparently means, to some comments, that it's really all on you because you didn't \"respect\" her feelings. Well, I'm not one of these people who thinks that a feeling is automatically valid. \n\n(And if every feeling is valid, then \"valid\" means nothing in context. Sort of like how everything labeled \"art\" is automatically art, then \"art\" means only \"has been called art\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she can't respect your desire to not be interrupted, she doesn't get to say you don't *also* get to object to being interrupted because it makes her feel bad. She should stop interrupting.", "NTA\n\nInterrupting someone who is in the middle of a sentence is REALLY rude. My ex used to do that and when Id say 'Please let me finish' he would say 'but I already know what you are going to say'. It was SO very rude.\n\nI dont think a deadpan face is rude at all. However, it bothers her ALOT so I would chat with her and say that the way she feels when you make a deadpan face, is the same way you feel when she cuts across your sentence and interrupts.\n\n(btw interrupting someone mid sentance is an action. Deadpan face is a reaction to that action. Its two different things)\n\nSo perhaps you can have a 'code' word when you each are doing what the other dislikes. When she interrupts you, you could say 'bingo' (or whatever you two decide) which should clue her in that she once again interrupted you. And if you do a deadpan face, she can do the same.\n\nIf she doesnt like that idea or if she isnt willing to work with you on this, then next time she interrupts you, I would say 'wow! did you just interrupt me in the middle of my sentence??\" and if you are in public I would definitely say it loud enough for everyone to hear and when she says you demeaned her or embarrassed her in front of her friends, the response is 'actually you did that to yourself'. And then carry on with the rest of the sentence.\n\nSometimes people dont realise they are doing it (interrupting). Sometimes they do and just dont care. I dont know about your partner, however no matter the intent, its still really rude.", "NTA. No one enjoys being interrupted with a question that would be answered by the asker just letting them finish what they are saying. Your reaction is one of the least rude ways to deal with the situation but I do suggest sitting down with your girlfriend at some point and trying to discuss this behaviour when you're not actively arguing about it.", "I would tell her that she could do all the talking and deciding since she overrides you all the time anyway.  Remain silent.", "NTA. Interrupters are super annoying. The reaction you have with the deadpan look is mature and impressive. Your GF is a dick.", "ESH neither of you is communicating effectively.  She shouldn't be interrupting, and you shouldn't be reacting so coldly. She's your SO, not some annoying work colleague.", "Your partner is giving you feedback about something that bothers them. It doesn't matter if it's fair, or if it's a misunderstanding, or whatever. If you dismiss it instead of engaging with it at all, you are telling her that you don't treat her feelings as valid. \"Well, you did something I found rude,\" isn't an argument in that case either, unless you want your argument to be, \"if you do something rude I don't have to care about your feelings!\"\n\nI would say NTA, but talk about both you being overly sensitive to being interrupted and her being overly sensitive to feeling belittled.

I hear advice along the lines of \u201ctalk about this at a time when you\u2019re not mad about it\u201d often, but the part that makes it difficult for me to follow is that it feels like I would be wasting a good moment, basically just starting a fight for no reason. (It shouldn\u2019t be a fight, but I know from past experience that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to turn into, because she has a hard time receiving criticism) Like: \u201cI know we are having a nice time watching this show together, but why don\u2019t we pause and talk about the stuff you do that I don\u2019t like, even though you\u2019re not actively doing it right now?\u201d\nAny advice on how NOT to make it go that way?", "Thank you for your response!

Why is my reaction wrong, but her initial action is not? I don\u2019t understand how a deadpan reaction = in charge.

Sure, we all need to always work on ourselves, but you are not a build-a-dilf and not enjoying being interrupted isn't a character flaw.\n\nI think this is more about making her feel she can tell you these concerns and feel listened to, and to create trust and understanding about what certain non verbal cues mean and don't mean.\n\nYou can always try to be more aware of coming across scary and do things to let her know whatever she is afraid of is not what is going on, but for that you would need to engage with the criticism and find out what that is in the first place.\n\nI don't think you should get credit for not yelling at your partner, that is a bare minimum.

Clearly did not work", "I agree with what you said about not feeling proud about not yelling. I guess what I was trying to say was that I\u2019m frustrated because she\u2019s treating me as if I DID do those things. Like my reaction was a 1.5 but she\u2019s acting like I was at a 6 on the aggression scale. She kept saying that the way I said it was \u201charsh\u201d but all I did was remove the niceness from my voice without adding any hostility or aggression.", "Thank you for your response! I\u2019m currently in the process of trying to communicate with her about this, but unfortunately, it\u2019s not going very well at all. I agree that it would be better to focus on finding a better way to navigate these situations than focusing on who\u2019s right or wrong. The issue I\u2019m currently facing however is: because she feels so certain that she is right and I am wrong, she does not seem willing to give me the empathy and understanding necessary for us to find a compromise. She believes she has undiagnosed ADHD and is sending me articles citing how it can be hard for people with ADHD not to interrupt. I told her I am willing to be more understanding of her interrupting if she can be more understanding that it negatively effects me when it happens, but she just said I\u2019m holding her accountable for something she can\u2019t control. So while I\u2019d prefer not to focus on who\u2019s right or wrong, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get empathy or understanding from her as long as she still believes that she was just being herself and I was just being mean.", "1.

When my students interrupt me I do the same thing you do and just stop and look at them. It isn't intended to be mean. I usually say, \"Please allow me to finish and the answer to your question is probably there.\" People are generally very impatient and bad listeners. People don't like waiting for a thorough explanation even when it matters. We're so stuck on our own instant gratification that we lack the ability to focus. Your wife is being rude and disrespectful. I'm sure she doesn't mean to be. Just as your expression on your face is not intended to be mean. You're annoyed and frustrated and rightfully so. A sour look on your face is still a better response than what could potentially fly out of your mouth that you can't easily take back. Please ask her what she would prefer. A sour look? Or a nasty tone in your voice? Because she lacks the ability to simply wait and listen, why should you be the one to be \"better\"? Where is the respect for you?", "To me, you do sound like you get defensive about being interrupted. She's not doing it on purpose to disrespect you and I doubt she wants to \"control your emotions about it\". It's entirely possible that the sudden contrast in your demeanor can be more startling or threatening than you realize. And it's entirely possible that she takes this a lot more personally than you mean it in return.\n\nYou just need to talk it out on a basis of trying to create a better understanding for each other, not on the basis of who is right and wrong.
