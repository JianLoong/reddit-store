From the time were born, I\u2019ve been helping my sister take care of my nieces.\n\nIris has a husband, David. David doesn\u2019t do much in raising his daughters, so I have had to pick up his slack since both the kids were born. I think it\u2019s important to note that he has a regular 9-5 job at a bank and iris is a doctor and works double the time he does. I\u2019ve had to cancel so many plans, trips etc to take care of my nieces when my sister was busy, but David was available. 90% of the time my sister would call me over to babysit, David would be watching sports or out hanging out with his friends. I didn\u2019t have the guts to say anything when I was younger so I just shut up about it.\n\nNow my sister is pregnant with her 3rd child. While I am excited for her, I\u2019m dreading it. The two girls are at an age now where its gotten a bit easier for me to look after them alone. I can\u2019t imagine having to take care of 3. \n\nI told my sister she\u2019s going to have to tell David to step up now that I have a job and not much free time. She said \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of that comment?\u201d. I said I\u2019ve been doing Davids share of parenting for 7 years, so she needs to tell him to do more because I won\u2019t be playing dad again. She got really mad at me and said she trusts me to look after my nieces because women are naturally better at it than men, which is why \u201cthe village\u201d just consists of women and girls. I said while I\u2019m happy to be her village, I refuse to be a parent to her kids.

Sounds like they make decent money to be hiring someone to take care of their kids instead of having you do it.  You allow it so they'll continue.

I\u2019m blown the fuck away that her husband can\u2019t watch his own kids. Every once in a while, sure, but it\u2019s clear you\u2019re expected to help with their children.

No one is an A H here except maybe the husband.", "NTA - I mean you obviously could've said it in a nicer way. The way you said it seemed you were looking to anger her.

I missed so many moments and trips with my friends because I had to babysit my nieces. I feel like I\u2019ve given up years of my life and I\u2019m not even a parent. I want to start being selfish and just live for myself without worrying about when my sister will need me to take care of the girls, but the guilt is actually insane.", "I think I\u2019ve just gotten used to everyone around me pretending like David is absolutely incapable of lifting a finger for his kids, that it kind of became the norm for me to step up when my sister wasn\u2019t available. My sister never calls me when she\u2019s home. She\u2019s either working, or taking care of her kids. So she isn\u2019t slacking on childcare tbh. But David isn\u2019t even the 3rd in charge. When I\u2019m not available, the girls go to my mum. She\u2019s old and has arthritis so can\u2019t do much, but she\u2019s still more likely to take care of the girls than David will. It\u2019s ridiculous.", "Right!? NTA. She should hold the dad accountable. The village includes everyone. Especially the father.", "I feel it's misogynistic too. It's terribly convenient that women are better at looking after kids, so men can just sit around and let the women do everything\n\nNTA", "I hope OP does not do this. I've never understood apologizing to keep the peace, its phony and gives the impression that the people around you can't grow or realize their mistakes.", "Sister is also an AH. Not only is she emotionally blackmailing OP, she\u2019s also making excuses for her deadbeat husband while still continuing to have children with him. Either she should tell her husband to pull his weight, or she should stop having more kids.\n\nSounds like the sister is relying on the continued free child care even for her third and that makes her a major AH in my opinion.", "In hindsight, I agree I could\u2019ve said it in a nicer way to be honest. But really, it\u2019s the truth. He doesn\u2019t parent. I think she babies him enough and I don\u2019t need to baby either of them further. \n\nGenuine question though, how could I have said it nicer? I\u2019m probably going to have another conversation about it with her so I\u2019d appreciate ideas on how to not sound mean but sound firm at the same time.", "Yeah I think I\u2019ll start saying \u201cis David too busy? Oh he\u2019s free? You won\u2019t need me then. Ciao \ud83d\ude07\u201d", "\"Unfortunately, I won't be able to do that / that won't work for me / I have plans / I'm not available.

While it's incredibly generous of you to help your sister as much as you have, her kids are her responsibility.  Enjoy your life!", "Declining gently will not work. You will have to put your foot down and it will get unpleasant. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your sister goes to the rest of the family and paints you out to be a bad guy. \n\nBut the fact is - she\u2019s having more children and that\u2019s what\u2019s triggering you. And you\u2019ve obviously made sacrifices in your life (presumably as a teen). This is grossly unfair on you and you are doing the right thing. So don\u2019t give in to the emotional blackmail that will no doubt follow the minute you stop providing free child care.", "7 years, you\u2019ve been doing this since you were only 15!! It\u2019s absolutely wild that she\u2019s felt entitled to your childcare for that long, especially since you were a literal child yourself the first 3 years. You deserve to enjoy your life and your 20s- you didn\u2019t sign up to have and parent 3 kids.", "Wow that is sad. So if you don\u2019t do it David does not step up.", "Iris thinks the village is a replacement for a useless father lmao.", "\"Listen, i understand it takes a village, but why does your village only consist of women? David has not even been given an opportunity to become a caregiver for the kids. To prove that he can do it. I'm still willing to be of the village, just not a \"key\" leader as I have other commitments now.\"\n\nHer and david are partners, not you and sis.\n\nEdit: read more comments andbsaw your responce that david will help only if it's an emergency.  Sis needs to leave hus deadbeat bankers ass.", "He does if it\u2019s an emergency and absolutely no one else is available.
