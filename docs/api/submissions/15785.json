I didn\u2019t have the guts to say anything when I was younger so I just shut up about it.\n\nNow my sister is pregnant with her 3rd child. While I am excited for her, I\u2019m dreading it. The two girls are at an age now where its gotten a bit easier for me to look after them alone. I can\u2019t imagine having to take care of 3. \n\nI told my sister she\u2019s going to have to tell David to step up now that I have a job and not much free time.

When I\u2019m not available, the girls go to my mum. She\u2019s old and has arthritis so can\u2019t do much, but she\u2019s still more likely to take care of the girls than David will.

Saying that men naturally suck at childcare is easier than admitting that her husband doesn't show up for his family as a parent. Shedding light to that would threaten the status quo and percieved security of her marriage, aka as long as someone picks up after the guy, she won't feel his absence. Because of that, she's agressively dismissive when you bring up how much David is not a parent.\n\nSo if you want to live your own life and step away from David's parental responsibilities, I would approach it in a way makes your sister empathize with you. Don't tally all the time you helped, don't list every sacrifice you've made for them (tempting it may be), that will just make her shut down. You were right to tell her that now you won't be able to help as much now that you have your own adult responsibilities. I would leave it at that, maybe remind her when the topic of childcare come up, and take it case by case in the future.

She has no right to demand to control your time. Stop babysitting at all. Glad your sister is not my doctor.", "Agreed. The sister is asking too little of her husband - he needs to parent.

However, just because your brain is telling you to feel guilty, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you have anything to feel guilty *about*. In this case, I\u2019m guessing the guilt is a conditioned response - you\u2019ve been made to feel guilty in the past when you set a boundary, so now you feel guilty when setting perfectly reasonable boundaries (ie not parenting someone else\u2019s children).  \n\nWhat this means is that the first few times you set boundaries with Iris, you are going to feel guilty.

Eventually, it\u2019ll get easier and easier until you no longer feel immense guilt when setting healthy boundaries. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of like working through a conditioned fear response - you need to keep exposing yourself to the dreaded stimulus in order to extinguish the response. The only way to get past the guilt is to set healthy boundaries, again and again, until you can do it without feeling guilty.

I'm just saying a lot of young men aren't emotionally equipped, and we need to change that. In order to change it, we need to recognize it as a problem.\n\n I shouldn't have to tell you that testosterone and estrogen are hormonal drugs and as such affect our feelings and behaviors.

For instance, testosterone influences men to act in a way that increases their social standing, often times becoming agressive. Estrogen influences emotions and behaviors in another way. However, the emotionally intelligent know that just because you feel a certain way doesn't mean you have to act on it. By repeatedly acting against your initial emotional response, you can train yourself to have more control over your responses.\n\nMen can be just as good parents as women, I've never said they couldn't. It's just that our biology mixed with social influences makes it statistically less likely that we will be a good parent. And again, I'm not saying \"men shouldn't be parents\", I'm saying men are literally more agressive and individualistic than women. It's, like always, a mix of genetic predisposition as well as environmental pressures. We need to do a better job of teaching young men to be more empathetic. \n\nI'm just seeing reality for what it is, our hormones influence our actions.

OP is NTA, but her sister is sexist and her husband useless.", "This reads like she doesn't think men are capable of caring for children more than David can't be trusted caring for children. I think the sister probably pushed David into the position he's in and since OP never fought it before, it just continued.", "You don\u2019t have to explain or prolong the conversation next time. Just say \u201csorry, I\u2019m not available.\u201d The guilt tripping is real but the more you let her talk the more you allow her to bully you.\n\nYou could also write her a letter explaining ALL you have done for your list, listing everything you had to give up for 7 YEARS. If she actually cares about you, she will listen. If not, you should reconsider how she fits into your life moving forward.", "Well. Made in heaven for everyone except you. You\u2019ve been free labor for your sister this whole time. What happens the day you stop taking care of her kids? What happens when you get to be the fun aunt instead of Mom#2?\n\nDoes she at least pay you in some way?\n\nEdit: never mind. I saw your other comment.", "They probably have a good relationship because he doesn't care for the kids as a father if he was doing his role They would have had a lot more arguments and she clearly doesn't expect much from him.", "I feel this. Like y\u2019all go care for the kids, I\u2019mma go guard the village.", "Terrifying, isn't it.", "You are doing everything right and it's your right to remind her, NTA.", "NTA and you are a golden retriever for sure lmao, but yeah NTA.", "Tell david that the whole subreddit is saying \"L dad\" to him, NTA.", "NTA. Generally being an aunt who is involved in your nieces\u2019 and nephews\u2019 lives is a good thing. I\u2019m sure they love to see you! And those relationships will be fruitful and fun for your whole life. \n\nBut you are correct that you should be involved in addition to both parents, not instead of a physically-present, mentally checked-out father. This is good boundary to set. I hope you can find a balance of staying involved in all their lives and not being called to take over because the father simply can\u2019t be bothered.", "At first i was all in that David was the AH, but I think sister is the bigger AH here.  David needs to step up, but it feels like he's been kept out of all parenting (except for making the baby to begin with).\n\nDefinitely OP is NTA.  This couple needs serious therapy as a couple and sis needs to hear how stupid she sounds from the whole village!", "> \u201cI don\u2019t trust my husband enough to care for his own children,\u201d \n\n...And then to have yet ANOTHER child with the same dude.", "Match made in hell more like it.  That's at least two more future women to grow up thinking they're just baby makers.", "More accurately misanthropic - not merely misandric or misogynistic, but diminishing all people by boxing them in. But if you must say one or the other, it's misandry - both dismissive of men's abilities and sidelining them from participation in society.", "Would you continue to have children with him when you knew he wasn't fit to be around children unsupervised?", "Try not to speak to her again for sure /s\n\nbut yeah you are not the asshole here, you are doing right.", "She trusted a 15 year old more than her own husband....", "Here is a fun idea - if Iris and David have good professional careers and are comfortable financially why don\u2019t they employ someone to help take care of their children. You are NTA and you are entitled to live your life. Stay strong and don\u2019t let your sister guilt trip you or her not talking to you make you give in.", "What kinda woman is your sister? You are just so fine, NTA.", "If you are AH then I am just not living in the right planet.", "That's just how you deal with the right situation, glad to see that people are just here supporting your decision, that's just making my day well and healthy now, good.", "Glad to see that people just gave you a reality check, you are NTA."]}
