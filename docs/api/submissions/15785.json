When I\u2019m not available, the girls go to my mum. She\u2019s old and has arthritis so can\u2019t do much, but she\u2019s still more likely to take care of the girls than David will.

Both your sister and David are the AH for exploiting you for free labor. Your sister seems to have bought into some sexist bullshit. I recommend for yourself anyways a book called Equal Partners by Kate Mangino.", "NTA\n\nLol, no. Literally 10 seconds of googling led me to this article https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/opinion/sunday/maternal-instinct-myth.html\n\nThe assumption that women are naturally better at caring is the oldest excuse for men to slack off, and there are a bunch of resources out there to debunk it.\n\nNow, I don't know what type of information can speak to your sister, or if there is a way to persuade her logically. Saying that men naturally suck at childcare is easier than admitting that her husband doesn't show up for his family as a parent. Shedding light to that would threaten the status quo and percieved security of her marriage, aka as long as someone picks up after the guy, she won't feel his absence. Because of that, she's agressively dismissive when you bring up how much David is not a parent.\n\nSo if you want to live your own life and step away from David's parental responsibilities, I would approach it in a way makes your sister empathize with you. Don't tally all the time you helped, don't list every sacrifice you've made for them (tempting it may be), that will just make her shut down. You were right to tell her that now you won't be able to help as much now that you have your own adult responsibilities. I would leave it at that, maybe remind her when the topic of childcare come up, and take it case by case in the future.

She has no right to demand to control your time. Stop babysitting at all. Glad your sister is not my doctor.", "Agreed. The sister is asking too little of her husband - he needs to parent.

Enough is enough. \n\nI do get why you felt you couldn\u2019t stand up for yourself when you were younger. Stand firm here. You aren\u2019t a parent for these children and it\u2019s time she stopped treating you like it.", "You didn't *have to* babysit you sister's kids. Yoi chose to.\n\nYou are not the asshole, but sadly you're definitely the doormat.", "I had a friend who was like you. The only difference we were in HS at the time. Her sister had a kid young and my friend missed out on a lot of activities we did on the weekends with a youth program we we were part of, there were times she couldn't come to the program after school because she had to babysit her nephew.", "Honestly, just say no, speak your mind, and let your sister be stubborn and whine.\n\nOnce you're not around and she sees how lazy and unhelpful her husband is, she'll realize who's truly in the wrong and either fix her relationship or kick him to the curb.", "There is no declining gently in this situation. You know it yourself.", "Actually, I don't think you should go for nicer. I think blunt and direct is the only way to go. Be clear, be firm, and don't get wishy washy. You've been doing this seven years out of the goodness of your heart. It's your sister who should be kissing your feet in gratitude and instead she's berating you.", "Your problem is trying to be \u201cnice\u201d about it. Your sister hasn\u2019t been \u201cnice\u201d to you. She been exploiting you for years, demanding free, alway available child care (do you have any idea the money you have has saved them!!) and that you sacrifice your social life, relationships and personal desires because her husband is an absent parent, enabled by her awful, misogynistic views. Clear, consistent boundaries and don\u2019t give in. She is going to rage and call you many things and accuse you of not caring, being a terrible aunt/sister, disappointing the girls, none of this is true. You have spent 7 YEARS parenting her children. You need to stop and live your own life. You\u2019re not asking for her permission to have a life. NTA", "Sister is extremely mysonogistic, she likely expects OP to marry her husband if she dies.", "I\u2019d stick to \u2018sorry, not available\u2019 and add the father part. That\u2019s gold. \n\nAnd don\u2019t JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) because that gives her an in for negotiation. \n\n\u2018No\u2019 in whichever way you want to dress it up is a full sentence.", "Yeah I\u2019d go for maybe 1 out of every 10 plans my friends would make. At a point they just stopped inviting me because they knew I wouldn\u2019t come. That was when I lived with my sister because we lived too far away from her and she convinced me to come stay with her so I can help her without having to drive back and forth. That was my senior year of high school I wasted it like that.", "Or, if op doesn\u2019t take him, then she likely expects the oldest daughter to take up the mantle of child-rearing when she\u2019s not around. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s already her backup option.", "If possible, you need to try to move to a different city/state for a bit. Let your sister deal with her life situation, and visit your nibblings for vacations. At least for a year or two. Live your life.", "That is just pathetic. I grew up in a very traditional home where my dad worked and my mom stayed home, and my dad did way more for me than this loser. He couldn't cook for shit, and he left messes for days, but he took me out most weekends to give my mom a break, he tried to help with my insomnia, and took over entirely when she had to travel for family. \n\nThis is something for your sister to work out with her spouse, you deserve to live your life."]}
