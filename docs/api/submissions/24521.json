I can not use cups and am allergic to all brands of pad I've used (rashes on all genitalia, which does not feel good). I do have cloth pads but I only brought a couple small ones for my trip as I wasn't due on until days after we got home, but we're on day four of our trip and I started my period on our first night. \n\nI tried to use some disposable pads I picked up but I broke out in a rash and have blisters everywhere they should not be, so two days ago I decided to say what the hell and free bleed like I do at home.\n\nI bring my own towels to my MILs, so I have been sitting and sleeping on those. I have bled through twice but cleaned the mess and left no stain. \n\nMy MIL is pissed off to say the least. She's disgusted by my lack of decorum and carrying my bloody towel around everywhere. She also hates that I'm washing them in her machines and is now saying we need to pay to have them professionally cleaned (which we will do).\n\nEverything kinda came to a head last night when she lost it on me for \"behaving like an animal\". She wants me to leave, but my husband stay, which isn't possible (one car, I can't drive that far, especially not with the amount of pain I'm in).\n\nMy husband is on damage control but I just feel so shitty. Am I in the wrong here? I understand that it's not super sanitary but my health matters more than some bed sheets. I'll replace them if she wants.\n\nI'm close to just gritting my teeth through the pain and putting a pad on, but I really don't want to. I don't want open sores down there when we're driving home - sitting for that long will suck.\n\nAITA? I feel like I'm choosing the lessar of two evils but now I don't know.", "created_utc": 1691892166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pmdcs/aita_for_free_bleeding_at_my_mils_house/", "score": 8530, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Free bleeding on furniture, sheets, etc and your only only response is to acknowledge that it isn't super sanitary but to continue to do it. On three days you had plenty of time (or your husband did) to explore local options for reusable pads, period underwear or other alternatives and haven't done it.\n\nThe walking around with a bloody towel would have been the end of it for me. It's attention seeking behavior as it not being properly prepared for your menses when you know you have unique needs during that time.", "YTA. Let me start by saying that I do not believe that periods are something to be ashamed of or hidden. But your period should be treated like any other bodily fluid. You don't go around showing people the snot in your tissue after you blow your nose. You don't poop in the backyard so everyone can go look at it. You don't bleed all over your clothes and a towel, then carry them all over the house with you to keep bleeding on.\n\nI'm sensitive to the bleaching agents used to sterilise pads. I use cloth pads or period underwear. And because I know I can't just pop out and buy a packet of pads I take enough self care items with me any time I go away just in case. I take steps to ensure no one else has to deal with my issue. You didn't.", "YTA. Listen I\u2019m a woman and I suffered for decades with painful oh horrifically painful endometriosis pain. Periods where I bled through a tampon and pad in 1-2 hrs. It was bad. I\u2019m also allergic to pretty much every pad. So I get it!!! I really do. But you\u2019re the a. This is not appropriate on any level. This is your MiL\u2019s home and it should be respected. Not \u201cI\u2019ll replace the sheets.\u201d If this is a major issue you should have prepared better. And If you did bring your cotton reusable pads why aren\u2019t you washing them (even by hand) and drying them to use?!?! This is crazy and you\u2019re in the wrong.", "YTA.  What in the hell did I just read?  You can\u2019t just bleed all over someone\u2019s house.", "YTA-if you want to free bleed, that\u2019s fine, just do it in your own home. It is disgusting to do it in someone else\u2019s home. It is rude and inconsiderate of you.", "YTA.\n\nPeriod panties are a thing! Buy them! I have endo and VERY bad, debilitating periods. Period panties completely changed the game for me and they\u2019re also super cute!\n\nEDIT: If you can handle regular underwear, you can most likely handle period panties. There are tons of options and materials too.", "What the actual fuck did I just read?  Yes you are the asshole for free bleeding in someone else\u2019s home.  You have washable pads!  Use them, wash them.  By now Amazon could\u2019ve delivered more.  Cut some cotton or flannel strips, something.  I\u2019ve had to improvise-so have most women, it\u2019s not that complicated. YTA", "While free bleeding may be your approach, I\u2019m with the MIL here\n\nAs a female myself who doesn\u2019t like the sight of blood, I would not be coping at all having someone staying in my home bleeding onto a towel, carrying it around and popping it into my washing machine\n\nThere\u2019s also going to be an impact of others enjoying their birthdays with the situation- you have stated you don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2018super sanitary\u2019\n\nYou packed \u2018some\u2019 small cloth pads- if this is what you can use successfully please go out immediately and buy some more\n\nIt\u2019s also not as simple as sheets, if you bleed through to the mattress that\u2019s a whole nother story\n\nYTA in this situation", "YTA. I get that you were kinda up a creek, but this is unacceptable and there ARE solutions. You NEED to prep better before you go to someone else\u2019s home if the issue is really this bad. \n\nit\u2019s super unsanitary to just be bleeding all over someone else\u2019s home (nothing to do with some sort of \u201cew gross periods\u201d mentally, it\u2019s just unsanitary), and offering to replace stuff just ain\u2019t cutting it, people shouldn\u2019t have to watch their stuff get ruined in the first place. You didn\u2019t prep before hand so then you need to either call an Uber and go home, or go out and get more cloth pads to use. Taking it upon yourself to free bleed in someone else\u2019s home is unacceptable.", "YTA\n\nFree bleeding is something you\u2019re free to do in your own home but not as a guest in someone else\u2019s. You should have either gone home when your period came unexpectedly or use period underwear, etc. I get why she\u2019s upset you\u2019re bleeding all over her house.", "YTA. I don't get it. You just... Bleed through your clothes and carry a bloody towel around with you?? This is not sanitary and there have to be solutions. You should have had more cloth pads. This is just gross.", "YTA. Your blood is not sanitary. Blood is biohazard. There should be a solution like period panties for you by now. If you brought cloth pads, why aren\u2019t you washing them? Have you talked about any of this with your gynecologist or did you just decide your going to bleed in someone else\u2019s home?\n\nIf your periods are this painful with a heavy flow, you should look into possibly having endometriosis or PCOS. \n\nI have endo. I needed surgery for relief.", "YTA, as someone who free bleeds. I know that if my flow is heavy enough to leak through my clothes, I need to have something INSIDE my clothes and invisible to others to stop the blood. I\u2019m also heavily allergic to pads and tampons and cannot take medicine to help the reaction so I get the discomfort. But you and your husband had more than enough time to go get something you can use. Shoot, you could have asked his mom and she probably would have been happier to do that than see a bloody towel everywhere.", "YTA. This is completely unsanitary and disgusting to do in someone else\u2019s home. You do have options you know can work, including period panties; you should have come prepared. Period suppression is also an option with contraceptives, for the future. \u201cFree bleeding\u201d in someone else\u2019s home is never an option. The better option would have been to leave, and if your husband needed to leave in order to facilitate that, that\u2019s fine. One must have quite a sense of entitlement to spill their biohazard all over someone else\u2019s home and property. Absolutely wild.", "Why did you not order some more cloth pads then? Why did you not wash and reuse the ones you carried??\n\nOr period underwear? \n\nYTA You can't walk around with a blood towel around someone's home. That must have a strong odour to it if you're just pouring into it.\n\nYou should left, and if that meant your husband goes, then so be it. He could have dropped you home to do your free bleeding there, and returned. \n\nYou had other options.", "Yes I would have to say yta. You are in someone else\u2019s house and you have to respect what they want in their home. Your mil is clearly not comfortable with it and thinks it is unsanitary and doesn\u2019t want blood on her towels or furniture (even if you can clean it without leaving a stain she still doesn\u2019t want it there to begin with). You have other options that will satisfy your mother in law. They make period panties now and you could have just bought a cheap tshirt or towel urself and made it into some rags to use as cloth pads since you didn\u2019t bring enough. And I have to be honest, I\u2019m a woman too and I would not be pleased if one of my family members came to stay with me and was free bleeding carrying around a bloody towel in my home either!!\n\nEdit to add: Not saying it was right but even in ancient times they had a separate hut for women to free bleed in so as not to stain and contaminate the communal rocks and tree stumps they sat on!!!", "Yes, you're in the wrong. You do not knowingly risk getting bodily fluids on someone elses furniture. YTA. Stay home with that bullshit.", "Yta .  You don\u2019t go to someone\u2019s house and bleed everywhere.  Are you aware that there are infections that are blood spread ? Those infections can live outside the body for weeks.  You want to do this , fine.  You don\u2019t subject anyone else to this nonsense. \n\nMy honest opinion is that you should have found some locally sourced fabric pads and made good use of them.  This is just a spectacle that doesn\u2019t need to happen. \n\nUrine comes out of your body, would you be ok if your mother in law free peed ?", "YTA - I understand a lot of what you're saying (as a woman with sensitive skin as well), but this is very bad decorum. It's too much. No shame in doing this at your own home, but you could have gone out and bought period undies or more cloth pads as soon as you realized you would run out. Or wash the ones you have, rather than washing the sheets you're bleeding onto.", "So if you\u2019ve bled through twice, but left no stain\u2026 you\u2019ve bloodied her furniture twice?  Even with sitting on towels?\n\nYour allergy and pain should just horrible. I sympathize with you on that. But I also sympathize with MIL and having someone bleed on her furniture. \n\nWhen it comes to finding solutions, it seems like you\u2019re saying: I can\u2019t do many methods, so I won\u2019t do any. Which makes no sense. \n\nLet\u2019s return to the period parties. \n\nHELLO!! I bet that even tho they leak, they hold up a heck of a lot better than regular panties!\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you choose to try them instead of saying, \u201cthey don\u2019t really work for me\u201d?  You could have them sent via Amazon in 1-2 days!\n\nYou could even wear double panties. Or make your own with flannel liners or something. \n\nI have to say YTA because it\u2019s not your house. And your dh should have driven you home and then come back. He\u2019s at fault too.", "YTA.  You can't do this at someone else's house.  Lots of that are natural should still be kept to yourself. It's not ok to subject people to your body fluids or free bleed onto their furniture. It's unsanitary and you're making people uncomfortable.\n\nYou can get cloth pads on amazon with pretty quick delivery. Or use a face cloth, a sanitary pad slid into a sock- something.", "I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re carrying around a towel instead of making DIY cloth pads. Put wash cloths in your underwear. Cut up one of your towels. You\u2019ve tried nothing and you\u2019re all out of ideas.\n\nIf you had diarrhea you would not be carrying around a towel with poop on it. If you had urinary incontinence you would not be free peeing around your MIL\u2019s house. Blood is very much like feces and urine. It belongs in the bathroom and out of sight. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like a really difficult and painful situation but you should figure out alternatives for when you are out of your home\n\nbuy or make more cloth pads\n\ntry a pad sandwich, underwear against your body and then a pad attached to a second underwear \n\nstay in a hotel", "Ever so gently, YTA. I understand. I went through heavy periods. Bringing towels to sleep on when visiting in case of leaks. Standing up and bleeding through pads and my clothes. I finally found a doctor who said \"No one deserves to live like this\".\n\nWhy haven't you and your husband left yet? No, you can't be at family gatherings carrying around a bloody towel and free bleeding is not an option in other people's homes unless they tell you it is ok. You sound miserable and in pain. Call this visit done.\n\nHave you tried period panties or organic products from health food stores? Are there fabric stores near you to buy flannel, linen, or other material to create your own temporary pads? If you are staying they might get you through the next few days.", "YTA. I\u2019m all for free bleeding if you desire, but cmon, you have options when staying in someone\u2019s home. Even if you are 1 in a million who can\u2019t use a silicone cup or period underwear, you definitely could put a waterproof blanket pad UNDER your towel. You also don\u2019t need to wash it in her washing machine and you don\u2019t need to sleep there. Their house, their rules. Something tells me you\u2019re being a rebellious brat and getting some kind of satisfaction out of this.", "YTA- this is disgusting. And why don\u2019t period undies work??", "Yta\u2026 you can\u2019t really think anyone but you is the asshole here.", "YTA just go home if you're not even gonna do the bare minimum of respecting other people's homes. It's 2023, I refuse to believe that this is the first time you get your period outside your own home, there must be some other alternative instead of just freely bleeding all over the furniture and carrying bloody towels everywhere. It doesn't even sound like you tried to find another solution.", "INFO- You said you have a few small cloth pads - aren't those reusable? Why aren't you wearing those? Double up if you have to. \n\nFree bleeding is fine until you're doing it all on someone's furniture and carrying around a bloody towel with you at family events. Blood is a biohazard that you're happily waving around and expecting people to not get upset about.\n\nWhen it became obvious that your MIL is unhappy with this, you should've gone to a hotel. Instead you chose to stay in her own house and upset her. As a woman, I would be very upset if someone did this in my house. I would find it disrespectful to have you risk staining my furniture on purpose. Your MIL is wrong about one thing: this is worse than an animal because *even my roommate's dog wears little doggie diapers when she's in heat*. No one wants someone else's bloodstains on their furniture. \n\nYour health is important and I am not suggesting you sacrifice your health and comfort. But you have options. Pack more cloth pads. Buy adult diapers if they're not too abrasive on your skin. Cut up a sleep shirt and use it as a cloth pad. Do anything besides carry a bloody rag around in someone else's house at a family function\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: spelling mistakes", "YTA. You can do what you want at your home, but you don't have that right at her house. You should have planned better. I get that you have some sensitivities to pads, etc. but what is going on his unsanitary for their household. I can understand why she doesn't want to see your towels and that she is uncomfortable with her towels being used in this manner and that you have bled through on their items. So, basically, when you travel or stay at someone's home, you should pack as if your period was expected for the duration of that visit.", "There are other products you can try, like period underpants.\n\nFree bleeding in your own space is one thing, but when you are bleeding through on someone else's furniture, that is when you cross the AH line.\n\nYTA", "YTA because this is unsanitary.  Wear period panties, try depends, wear incontinence pads (they may be made of different material) or fold up a wash cloth and put it between 2 layers of underwear.  There\u2019s plenty of things that can work on the fly that would be more sanitary than free bleeding", "YTA.\n\n\nWow. Get a cup, SOMETHING.

Knowing your issues with disposible products you should have been prepared.  Free bleeding when you're a guest is not ok.", "Yta. It\u2019s her house and I get she doesn\u2019t want to see that. Try period pants. I started using them about a year ago no they are so much better than any other product. A bit more expensive but they last for ages", "YTA - an accident is one thing, but I found out you were a guest at my house and made the choice to bleed all over the place on purpose\u2026 you\u2019d be out with your partner and unwelcome to stay again until you got a hysterectomy.", "This can't be real. There's no way some is this entitled and oblivious.", "Yes, YTA. If you were at your house that would be one thing, but you are a guest at someone else\u2019s house. Not super sanitary? Blood is a bio hazardous material and I don\u2019t blame your MIL for being upset. With as sensitive as you are to various period products, in the future you should be fully prepared with products that work for you whenever you travel, just so you don\u2019t run into this again. For now, you might want to move to a hotel.", "huge yta. cmon babes, that's not cool. and it's wild that you would even think that's the case. respect other people's boundaries, yours aren't the only ones that matter. \n\ni understand your issues with period products, but knowing that you should have prepared for all situations.", "YTA. it\u2019s not your house how dense can you be? you\u2019ve also had how long to figure this out? there\u2019s cotton disposable pads in 2023 as well, there\u2019s def something out there that would work to prevent this issue.", "YTA. There is no replacing the bed sheets \u00ab\u00a0 if she wants\u00a0\u00bb. Replace the freaking bed sheets. Order really nice new ones. Then go check yourself into a hotel and free bleed all you want. Speak to your doctor about an IUD so you stop getting your period. I get it. Even the natural pads from health food stores give me sores and rashes. Guess what - I still don\u2019t bleed all over other people\u2019s houses. If you are going to attend an event put a pad on when you leave the hotel. Otherwise order period underwear, in 2 sizes so you can double it up, and some more cloth pads. You can even put regular pads between the two layers of period underwear. You can also buy baby cloth diapers and use the pads on your own regular underwear. Send your husband out for supplies - why on earth hasn\u2019t he already taken Action? And for goodness sake send the woman a gift basket for what you have already subjected her to.", "Soft YTA. Sure, if this is how you want to do it,  I get it. Yes, your health matters, no one is saying otherwise. \n\nHowever, \"it's not super sanitary\" - correct, blood is a biohazard. And it's totally reasonable for another person to not be OK this happening in their home. You got lucky nothing stained and such but it's not OK to be willing to permanently damage someone else's belongings. And, not everyone is as comfortable with blood (even people who have periods). \n\n(If you haven't tried period underwear, I HIGHLY recommend it. Game changer. more comfortable, everything. Knix is a terrific brand.)", "I don't say this lightly, but with all your other issues, all of your allergies, and your propensity to bleed excessively, are you sure you should be trying to have a kid? It sounds like you need to have your uterus removed.\n\nEdit: I know this sounds rude, but I genuinely mean it as a health concern. You sound like 2 of the 3 women I know that died during childbirth.", "YTA you gotta prep better for this kind of thing look into getting period panties or pants if you are gonna free bleed. Also if your periods are so bad you can\u2019t drive you should look into birth control cause that\u2019s not normal!", "YTA - I 100% understand what you\u2019re going through, but the correct thing to do when you began your cycle early was to go home.", "Yta.  That\u2019s totally over the line. Surely there are options that could work for you. It\u2019s not just about staining, but it\u2019s not hygienic.

But I 100% get why your MIL is upset.", "YTA You do not do that in someone else\u2019s home. It is beyond not sanitary, No one wants to see you parading around with your bloody towel.

In your circumstance I would always travel with my supplies, since you supposedly can\u2019t use anything else.   \n\n\nWhen you do get home go see your doctor. Discuss hysterectomy, ablation, hormones, find out what all your options are, then pick one.

I actually suffer the same issues you do, and I would be going to the local Walmart and buying those giant car washing cloths to stick in my underwear if I had to.

Don\u2019t bleed all over other people\u2019s houses!!!!", "Whoa YTA and really inconsiderate/ selfish. You could have gotten a hotel room, bought extra towels / cloths / talked to her about it / left to go home. You are acting like putting this on her as a guest was your ONLY option \ud83d\ude44", "Use \" cloth diapers\". My grandmother used rags. I am sure you can find a more comfortable modern version. Have you tried period underwear? I have some that can hold 8X what a tampon can but look like any other underpants.", "Yta They also have period underwear, have you tried those?", "Gently, YTA. I don't like the people saying that you should suck it up and wear pads, since those are causing allergic reactions and that's reasonable to want to avoid them, but tampons, period panties, or bringing your own reusable towels are all options, and I can't fault your MIL for being frustrated that you're knowingly going to bed and have bled through onto her sheets multiple times. Especially since it sounds like you're not just doing this in bed, you're not just lining your underwear with the towel, but you're carrying a bloodstained towel around with you and sitting on it? That's not sanitary. That's not sanitary for her furniture and for everyone in her house who's coming into contact with the things it rested on. I don't blame her for being upset.\n\nIf you can afford to have everything professionally cleaned, why can't you go to a department store and buy a big pack of wash-cloths, then use them as makeshift pads? Maybe keeping the blood inside your underwear would help things?\n\nETA: Also, I don't want to be that person who's telling someone 'just go see a doctor!' because I know that the medical organizations are not always great at taking women seriously on these issues but... If you haven't, see a doctor. And if your current doctor doesn't take this seriously, consider a second opinion.", "It\u2019s definitely inconsiderate to do that in someone else\u2019s home without discussing it first.

WTF?", "If you have so many health problems, having a baby is going to make everything more difficult. Sounds like you are debilitated with medical issues. An ablation or hysterectomy would give you some relief. Many people can\u2019t handle the sight of blood. And how is sitting on a towel different from stuffing a big towel in your pant bottoms? Why not buy some big towels cheap and throw away the dirty ones? Or take them to the laundromat to clean? Or anything besides upsetting your host?", "YTA. There are so many options. There are pads for sensitive skin - do you react to all of the disposable pads for people with sensitivities? If so then period panties, reusable diapers, getting more cloth pads, etc. are options.\n\nI have sensitive skin, I mostly use tampons. I took a look at my disposable pads, La Vie, Always Cotton and Natracare are all cotton for the part that touches your skin.", "Have you tried tampons? You didn\u2019t include those and wasn\u2019t sure. You need to see an OBGYN and primary doctor for these problems.

Good lord, if I were you, I would never travel ANYWHERE without PLENTY of supplies with me, even if I didn't think my period was supposed to come for another 2 weeks, let alone another week.  I'd never be without supplies if I could help it.  (In fact, even when not in your position, with fairly normal periods, I \\*did\\* never travel without at least enough pads to tide me over until I could go out to the store and get more, should I have needed them.)\n\nLike, I get that you're an adult and you've been living with this problem for a long time.  You've obviously tried a bunch of stuff, trying to find something that works, and you haven't found anything -- no pads or tampons you can use, period underwear that you've tried so far isn't enough, you can't wear a cup (I hear you, I couldn't either even though friends swear by them).  \n\nBut, on the other hand, reading your post, it just feels like... there is more problem-solving you could have done in your MIL's house, and could be doing generally.  The solutions you describe coming up with are NOT good solutions.\n\nAre you in the U.S.?  (Can't always assume!)  If you are, and your MIL's house isn't in a completely isolated area, then you and your husband had options.  You go out to the supermarket, or to Walmart or whatever, and you get supplies.  Maybe buy some extra sheets so you're not using your MIL's.  Buy cheap cotton washcloths and safety pins, to supplement the few cotton pads you brought.  \n\nGo into the pet aisle, and find the packages of puppy training pads -- they come in different sizes, but the smallest are like 1.5 feet to a side, and they come in packages of 20 or whatever.  At the very least, sit on THOSE (and put those under you while you sleep, so you don't wind up bleeding into the mattress).  They're disposable -- put one under you when you sit, then get up, wad that one up and throw it away, and put a fresh one down the next time you sit down. That way you're keeping things contained and not carrying around a towel that is getting more and more bloody as time goes on.\n\nAre those very-very absorbent?  No.  But you can change them out as often as you want.  Double them up if you feel the need, although the plastic backing SHOULD keep blood from going through.  It's also possible, of course, that Walmart or something might have mattress protectors -- but for the time during which you're traveling, screw it, get disposable stuff. That way you're not having to wash the mattress protectors all the time too.\n\nIt's just... you're the asshole because, the moment you did start your period, you didn't consult with your MIL about the problem (or that's how it sounds), and it also doesn't sound like you and your husband gave any thought to \"how can we handle this and NOT get blood on ANYTHING in MIL's house?\"  It seems like you just sort of gave up.", "YTA\nBig time!\n\nI can't even begin to go into detail of how absolutely disgusting and unsanitary this is, not to mention how disrespectful it is to someone else's home for you to assume that this would be acceptable no matter what kind of allergies that you have.

I can not use cups and am allergic to all brands of pad I've used (rashes on all genitalia, which does not feel good). I do have cloth pads but I only brought a couple small ones for my trip as I wasn't due on until days after we got home, but we're on day four of our trip and I started my period on our first night. \n\nI tried to use some disposable pads I picked up but I broke out in a rash and have blisters everywhere they should not be, so two days ago I decided to say what the hell and free bleed like I do at home.\n\nI bring my own towels to my MILs, so I have been sitting and sleeping on those. I have bled through twice but cleaned the mess and left no stain. \n\nMy MIL is pissed off to say the least. She's disgusted by my lack of decorum and carrying my bloody towel around everywhere. She also hates that I'm washing them in her machines and is now saying we need to pay to have them professionally cleaned (which we will do).\n\nEverything kinda came to a head last night when she lost it on me for \"behaving like an animal\". She wants me to leave, but my husband stay, which isn't possible (one car, I can't drive that far, especially not with the amount of pain I'm in).\n\nMy husband is on damage control but I just feel so shitty. Am I in the wrong here? I understand that it's not super sanitary but my health matters more than some bed sheets. I'll replace them if she wants.\n\nI'm close to just gritting my teeth through the pain and putting a pad on, but I really don't want to. I don't want open sores down there when we're driving home - sitting for that long will suck.\n\nAITA? I feel like I'm choosing the lessar of two evils but now I don't know.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I do not know where the place your staying is similar to mine, however the local supermarkets here are also selling period underwear as well or if you were there long enough how bout Amazon.\n\nI'm only going ESH cause MIL should have more understanding of the situation and not of this sigma of washing etc being disgusting. Though you also should be thinking of better solutions too, even if it was covering the costs of mattress protectors and buying some cheap sheets to use while there.  Even baby change mats  the disposal ones would of been good to wrap around you.", "ESH\n\nI don't think free bleeding when you are bleeding enough to go though a towel and only using a towel is an acceptable solution. I feel like you could put a waterproof baby changing pad or plastic bag under your towel, put cloth over a disposable pad, wear regular underwear in 2 layers with a disposable pad between,  buy a folding chair or camp cot to sit on. Go home or to a hotel.\n\nYour husband should be helpjng you resolve this better.\n\nYour mil is being unnecessarily dramatic to demand her washing machine is professionally cleaned. It'd be nice if she was helping you come up with a better solution.", "NTA - even with cycling through the fabric pads it will be hard to have one constantly. Rashes suck in general and having one down there would be 10x worse. I understand both parties but if you're cleaning everything with no traces behind, and willing to replace stuff, I don't see the problem.", "ESH. Yes, it\u2019s \u201cunsanitary\u201d and not socially acceptable, but MIL never bled? She acts like it\u2019s moldy feces. \n\nYou more suck because it\u2019s her house and she\u2019s disgusted by it, than you are simply for doing something natural. Come hang out at my house. I know that a carpet cleaner works on a couch, and also know that your period blood stain isn\u2019t going to kill anyone. <3\n\nTo the people telling her she needs to get on birth control, that\u2019s outrageous. Not everyone wants to shove hormones into their system and potentially worsen the problem, or have to put up with those side effects. She is allowed to be human. She is allowed to be a WOMAN. Women bleed, it\u2019s not hurting anyone. MIL is just worried about appearances and doesn\u2019t know how to relax. If OP grew up in a house or family where all the women were close with each other, this might not even be something that is \u201csocially unacceptable\u201d in the sun culture she was raised in. It sure wouldn\u2019t be in mine.", "I\u2019m so sorry you are dealing with all of this.  Honestly, I think there\u2019s a level of ESH.  Your MIL, as a women, should be able to at least communicate with you calmly and help you look for solutions.  I get she\u2019s from a different generation that handles all of the menstrual stuff a lot different but come on.  You\u2019re a family member in pain, with a problem.  She should have helped instead of shamed. \n\nBut also, I have to admit I\u2019d have trouble with you carrying towels around my house to sit on.  You have to have a better plan in place, for when you are at work, for in public, for other people\u2019s homes.  You could have even cut up a towel or something a \u201csafe\u201d fabric for you to make your own pads at this point.  That would have been better than knowingly using a product that caused a rash.  I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve tried the period panties - do they cause you to break out also?  \n\nSide note - Does the witch hazel products (like the tucks pads) that are so great post-birth help at all? \n\nIt all sound painful and awful, and really I am horrified that you are dealing with any of it, away from home, with blisters where no one wants blisters.  But really, if you know it\u2019s this bad for you, you need to be more proactive.  Good rule of thumb (because Mother Nature is an unpredictable bi*ch sometimes), always travel assuming your period is going to show up.  \n\nFeel better.", "Ugh this is tough.  Can you visit an OBGYN and ask about hypoallergenic alternatives?  Sheesh I dunno what to say about this lol.  MIL could be a little more empathetic though", "NTA. You\u2019ve got very legitimate medical contraindications to using menstrual hygiene products. You did not plan to have your period there. I really can\u2019t fault you for that, mine\u2019s certainly hit unexpectedly. You can\u2019t send someone to buy you menstrual products at the store because stores don\u2019t carry cloth pads. This is equivalent to getting food poisoning on a trip. It\u2019s gross, but it\u2019s outside of your control and you\u2019re not healthy enough to travel home until it\u2019s over.\n\nIf it\u2019s a front-load washer, you do have to rinse blood out before adding towels/underwear to the load but it\u2019s absolutely bizarre how grossed out another woman is by this. \n\nThis is just me putting out a hypothetical, but I wonder if you could stuff a pad in a sock. Like if you\u2019re without supplies in the future, drug stores normally have cotton socks and pads, cut the sock down to fit and put the pad in it so it\u2019s not directly against your skin. Maybe pair it with period panties in case it leaks through. Or get a microfiber/shamwow type towel from the grocery store and fold it up into a pad shape and use that as like a towel that fits in your panties so no one has to see it.", "Have you ever tried a diva cup? Or any period cup product? I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re great for those with sensitive skin.\n\nESH - it seems like you\u2019re doing your best to make do out of a crappy situation. But it also seems like your MILs reaction wasn\u2019t reactive as much as it built up bit by bit and it\u2019s just reached it\u2019s natural boiling point. Depending on the type of furniture she has, fabric upholstered or not I can understand her concerns about staining.\n\nOther thought, rinse the towels out in the shower to get most of the blood out before you throw them in the wash. She might feel better seeing you compromise a bit in her direction, and it might ease up some overall tension.", "You poor creature. I feel your pain as I have similar issues with pads/cups. I use cloth pads, and TMI, I have used socks. I suggest you have hubby go buy you some socks and see if that will help keep it at bay. Older women come from a different time and do not understand. My mom is the same way with me (tells me how disgusting I am), but of course I am in my own home. I wouldn't call what I do a free bleed so much as a no pad bleed\n\nThat being said, it's a tentative ESH from me. \n\nInfo: Did you try to talk to MIL about it when you realized you were on your cycle? \n\nIt doesn't sound like you did. That probably would have gone a long way towards mitigating the hostility. Additionally it's not your house. If it were me, and knowing my health situation was like yours, I would have probably told hubby we need to leave. \n\nInfo: How are you managing the get togethers. Are they all at MIL? I can't imagine it's easy to go out in your condition\n\nHowever, your MIL imo is being an archaic jerk and since she is a fellow female I would hope she would have a little more compassion. Period blood is not as bad as she's making it out to be. You need to come up with a solution so that it does not bleed though. That is beyond the pale when it isn't your home imo\n\nDon't be ashamed of your body. I would apologize to MIL and explain your health situation. Be prepared that she may not care/understand at this point\n\nTLDR: You shouldn't bleed everywhere when it's someone else's home. Your MIL should be better to you and more compassionate. Women have been shamed for their periods for far too long", "Going against the grain here to say NTA, but you and hubby should really just head home.

I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and say at least one of those birthdays was for a girl, who may or may not also have periods. Sure period blood is gross but it\u2019s natural. Things can be replaced and cleaned it\u2019s not a big deal.", "NAH but you need to see a doctor. Nothing about any of this seems healthy", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t be carrying around a bloody towel but her being mad you\u2019re washing them them in her machine? What else would you do? IMO, you should just cut up a couple of your towels and put them in your panties, then change out in the bathroom when needed. \n\nYou can also layer your undies for better protection.

I don't think your MIL is at all wrong for not being comfortable with someone bleeding in her home. She could have offered to help you find something that would work, you are a guest and family. You are not wrong for trying to ease your pain. I had severe problems with my period and period products. I understand why you needed to ease your pain. A better option would have been to buy more cloth pads, or even something that could get you through. Your MIL overreacted about her washing machine. You should have been able to use the pads you did have. That would have solved the problem and helped you be comfortable.

I think it\u2019s crazy how no one else in this thread seems to have heard of people being allergic to pads and tampons, because that happens sometimes. blisters and cuts on your genitals are PAINFUL and unsanitary. you shouldn\u2019t inflict harm on yourself because of a bunch of people saying it\u2019s gross\u2026sometimes people start their periods unexpectedly and don\u2019t have a pad or tampon, should we tell them how gross it is or leave them alone? it\u2019s really kind of insane that people are saying you should basically be banished to go stay in a hotel or be taken home & left there alone while you\u2019re in tremendous pain. i wouldn\u2019t pay to have the washing machine professionally cleaned, people don\u2019t get their washers cleaned every time sometime gets their period without a pad and washes their underwear. that\u2019s ridiculous. your MIL can run an empty load with bleach if she\u2019s worried. the only advice I can give you is to just bring cloth pads anytime you\u2019re leaving the house overnight (better yet just skip trips to your MILs house), try period panties, and look into options for stopping your period. there\u2019s so many options now for stopping it or making it lighter if you\u2019re interested in that. sorry people are being shitty to you OP, hope you feel better soon.", "NTA\n\nI know other people might not like it, but you actually don\u2019t have a healthy and safe alternative.\nIt\u2019s not like you can just not have your period to avoid inconveniencing others. \n\nYou\u2019re doing your best.
