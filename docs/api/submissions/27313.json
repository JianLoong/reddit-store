Clearly, Ana thinks she can walk all over you without consequences. You're not her personal ATM or her doormat. If she can't give you basic respect, why should you bend over backwards for her? Directing her to the person she might listen to was the right move. She needs a reality check.", "NTA - Ana\u2019s behavior is unacceptable and your husband\u2019s response is worse. He is being totally unsupportive and is letting his daughter abuse you. \n\nA question to think about, you\u2019ve been married for 6 months. Is this relationship worth the next 2 years (or realistically more) of your husband and Ana\u2019s BS? Because I don\u2019t see this AH guy changing.", "NTA but your husband sure is.\n\n>If I tell my husband, she screams that I'm a lowlife narc. When I brought this up to my husband, he told me to handle things like an adult and nobody likes a narc.\n\nWithout having any input on what the rules and punishments are don't even get to report to him what happened?  That's just bad parenting on his part.", "NTA\n\n>Handle things like an adult and nobody likes a narc.  \n>  \n>...should've acted like an adult and had an adult conversation with Ana\n\nDoes he put his finger on his nose and declare \"Not It?\" \n\nHow can he expect you to have an 'adult' talk with 16F? She's not an adult yet!", "NTA Ana can\u2019t seem to respect you so why should you have to fork over $100. Also I\u2019ve never loaned/given money to anyone without an explanation of what the money is going towards. Dad seems to be siding with her so he deserved what he got. If he doesn\u2019t like that she interrupted his meeting then he needs to set boundaries for the future.", "Nta. She seems like she's just like dad for some odd reason lol . Tell dad you're done being the adult since she doesn't care either way and he can handle alllll parenting for now on. You are now no longer responsible for anything. He can grow up and handle it like an adult now.", "Nacho all the way- not your child, not your problem", "NTA. You and your husband need to have a serious talk about both her behavior and your parenting plan. He wants to be the one to set and enforce the rules, but refuses to listen when you ask him to do that. He\u2019s telling you to handle it like an adult, but you agreed that you wouldn\u2019t be the one deciding punishments or rules. He\u2019s removed ANY power you had in that situation- he doesn\u2019t want to hear about it, and he won\u2019t actually deal with it, but you\u2019re not allowed to do anything? HELL. NO. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a parent but you do have to have some authority in your own home. If you\u2019re not allowed to assign punishments OR tell your husband about his daughter\u2019s misbehavior, you\u2019ve basically been relegated to nothing in your own home. You\u2019re basically there for her to stomp on. Absolutely unacceptable.", "She is only doing what she learned. Which is disrespect for you", "You did have an adult conversation - when she asked for money, you wanted to know what the money would go to; when she couldn't give you that, you politely declined and suggested another avenue. \n\nAna did not have an adult conversation. She was entitled and when she couldn't get her way she threw a tantrum. Ana is also a teenager dealing with some pretty big changes in her life, not an adult. So I suspect she will continue to have many other conversations in which she does not act like an adult.\n\nI'm not sure why your husband thinks you're responsible for Ana's behavior, but you're not. I'm not sure why he thinks that you're not behaving like an adult, but you are. I'm not sure why he thinks Ana behaving like an upset teenager makes you less of an adult, but it doesn't. He needs to parent his kid. \n\nYou're NTA, but if your husband doesn't want to parent his kid, this isn't going to get any better.", "NTA. Ana clearly has a lot of adjusting to do. What strikes me here is \"my husband and I agreed that I will take the role of stepmother.\" Okay, back up a sec...\n\nAna's mom is deceased.\n\nYou and Ana's dad have been married only six months.\n\nAnd, you both arbitrarily decided how your household relationships were going to go. Without consulting Ana. She's old enough to have input. Does she want a friend first, does she want an aunt/niece relationship. What about big sister? You guys just plopped Ana down and told her like it is.\n\nAs for the home office, both of you seem to have a clear lack of disrespect for your husband's work environment. Ana charging in and asking money from her dad there and then might not have happened if you hadn't been egging her on. So ESH for this part.", "Seems like there\u2019s a couple of entirely seperate questions here. \n- are you an AH for not giving Ana $100 with no explanation? No. If she wants to play \u201cI don\u2019t have to explain because you\u2019re not my mother\u201d then you\u2019re under no obligation to give her money because she\u2019s not your daughter.\n- your husbands lack of support for you enforcing his rules: if you\u2019re expected to \u201chandle\u201d things, he needs to support your handling. Without that support, he needs to understand that there will be no enforcement. (Is he maybe doing a bad job of telling you he doesn\u2019t expect you to enforce his rules?)\n- sending his daughter to talk to him during a meeting (which is the question you actually asked for judgement on), yes, YTA for that.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d IS an adult conversation.", "ESH - All of you have serious problems, I understand that these posts often don't include all of the complexities of given situations; that being said; at the absolute least; assuming you haven't embellished or lied, the fact that you've remained in this situation means that you've done a tremendous disservice to yourself. The textbook definition of insanity is repeating the same action in the same sequence and expecting a different outcome; to surmise, I'm saying that you've been fooling; and hurting, yourself needlessly. Do yourself a favor and leave this situation and also please reach out to someone to talk to, we all need someone in our times of tribulation and the fact that for you this isn't your husband should tell you everything you need to know.

You politely asked her what the money was for, and Ana went off. Most adults will disengage with abusive behaviour.", "NTA, but your husband is.", "NTA", "NTA. Your husband is the one with the child and who has the obligation to support her. She has no right to your money, especially that much for no reason she's willing to disclose; had she asked nicely and told you what she wanted it for you still would be in the right for saying no. \n\nIs Anna in counseling? She should be whether to talk through her grief or her anger that her dad remarried.\n\nThis is a husband problem; his daughter needs to talk to you respectfully but knows he won't enforce it.

You deserve at least basic respect, not just from Ana but from him, too.
