NO. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a parent but you do have to have some authority in your own home. If you\u2019re not allowed to assign punishments OR tell your husband about his daughter\u2019s misbehavior, you\u2019ve basically been relegated to nothing in your own home.

She was entitled and when she couldn't get her way she threw a tantrum. Ana is also a teenager dealing with some pretty big changes in her life, not an adult.

Without consulting Ana. She's old enough to have input. Does she want a friend first, does she want an aunt/niece relationship. What about big sister? You guys just plopped Ana down and told her like it is.\n\nAs for the home office, both of you seem to have a clear lack of disrespect for your husband's work environment.

Also, how often do you take positive interst in her life? Give her genuine complinents? Share something about yourself? What is your relationship like?
