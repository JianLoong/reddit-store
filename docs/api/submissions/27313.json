Also I\u2019ve never loaned/given money to anyone without an explanation of what the money is going towards. Dad seems to be siding with her so he deserved what he got.

You and your husband need to have a serious talk about both her behavior and your parenting plan. He wants to be the one to set and enforce the rules, but refuses to listen when you ask him to do that. He\u2019s telling you to handle it like an adult, but you agreed that you wouldn\u2019t be the one deciding punishments or rules. He\u2019s removed ANY power you had in that situation- he doesn\u2019t want to hear about it, and he won\u2019t actually deal with it, but you\u2019re not allowed to do anything? HELL. NO. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a parent but you do have to have some authority in your own home. If you\u2019re not allowed to assign punishments OR tell your husband about his daughter\u2019s misbehavior, you\u2019ve basically been relegated to nothing in your own home. You\u2019re basically there for her to stomp on. Absolutely unacceptable.", "She is only doing what she learned. Which is disrespect for you", "You did have an adult conversation - when she asked for money, you wanted to know what the money would go to; when she couldn't give you that, you politely declined and suggested another avenue. \n\nAna did not have an adult conversation. She was entitled and when she couldn't get her way she threw a tantrum. Ana is also a teenager dealing with some pretty big changes in her life, not an adult. So I suspect she will continue to have many other conversations in which she does not act like an adult.\n\nI'm not sure why your husband thinks you're responsible for Ana's behavior, but you're not. I'm not sure why he thinks that you're not behaving like an adult, but you are. I'm not sure why he thinks Ana behaving like an upset teenager makes you less of an adult, but it doesn't.

What strikes me here is \"my husband and I agreed that I will take the role of stepmother.\" Okay, back up a sec...\n\nAna's mom is deceased.\n\nYou and Ana's dad have been married only six months.\n\nAnd, you both arbitrarily decided how your household relationships were going to go. Without consulting Ana. She's old enough to have input. Does she want a friend first, does she want an aunt/niece relationship. What about big sister? You guys just plopped Ana down and told her like it is.\n\nAs for the home office, both of you seem to have a clear lack of disrespect for your husband's work environment. Ana charging in and asking money from her dad there and then might not have happened if you hadn't been egging her on. So ESH for this part.", "Seems like there\u2019s a couple of entirely seperate questions here. \n- are you an AH for not giving Ana $100 with no explanation? No. If she wants to play \u201cI don\u2019t have to explain because you\u2019re not my mother\u201d then you\u2019re under no obligation to give her money because she\u2019s not your daughter.\n- your husbands lack of support for you enforcing his rules: if you\u2019re expected to \u201chandle\u201d things, he needs to support your handling.

'No, I'm not your mother, but you are asking me for money and if you want it, you need to answer what it is for. Or you can wait until your dad is done with his meeting and talk to him.' Also, how often do you take positive interst in her life? Give her genuine complinents? Share something about yourself? What is your relationship like? Could it be worked on to be more on terms of being 'good-ish', but not 'step' something and not 'besties'? Take the pressure off?\n\nWhen she starts being rude 'You do not talk to me that way.
