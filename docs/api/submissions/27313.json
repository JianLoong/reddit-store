NO. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a parent but you do have to have some authority in your own home. If you\u2019re not allowed to assign punishments OR tell your husband about his daughter\u2019s misbehavior, you\u2019ve basically been relegated to nothing in your own home.

Without consulting Ana. She's old enough to have input. Does she want a friend first, does she want an aunt/niece relationship. What about big sister? You guys just plopped Ana down and told her like it is.\n\nAs for the home office, both of you seem to have a clear lack of disrespect for your husband's work environment.

Also, how often do you take positive interst in her life? Give her genuine complinents? Share something about yourself? What is your relationship like?

Is he 14?\n\nNTA", "The child needs therapy and dad needs to learn parenting skills. \nThis is her way of communicating that she doesn't like her situation. Her mother is no longer here and now she has to accept another mother figure in her life and it's not fair. \nOne day she will be thankful for the love that you \"can\" give her. You just have to get through this tough stage. \n\nMy daughter's 16 yr old attitude was HORRIBLE. And she lost her dad right after turning 16. \nIt gets better.", "Nta but you have a major husband problem", "Honestly, i see divorce coming! If he can't have your back against his daughter showing you at least a little bit of respect, then it won't ever work. NTA! Also if you aren't her mom, then why should you give her any money?", "Nta. He's not addressing her behaviour issues and she clearly doesn't want your discipline so he needs to step up", "NTA - Husband sets the rules, you try to enforce, she ignores. You complain to your husband - he tells you to deal with it.  Seriously, how much MORE time are you going to invest in this toxic relationship/household. Get out while the going's good, and you get saddled with (non-step) children and have to deal with this guy for the next 18 or more years.", "NTA but you have a husband problem. She's a teenager whose dad doesn't seem to want to deal with her", "NTA.  This isn't a family dynamic that will work if he isn't going to take an active role.  The two of them have already worn you down to the point where you have apparently no desire to parent his spawn whatsoever. She won't listen to you, and he reinforces her assertion that you are a narc.  It's a battle you can't possibly win.  Insist on family counseling, leave, or at minimum tell them your days as a punching bag for the two of them are OVER.  That they BOTH need to respect you as a human being or else.", "Let him that if he can't get her under control, you're gone. NTA", "NTA.

Your husband is definitely leaving you out to dry.", "ESH \n\nYour husband namely for being such a horrible back seat parent. Your step daughter for being rude. And you for just deciding you are going to be her step mom. Not even your husband gets to make that choice for her. She needs to not yell obscenities at you but I kind of get her. Her dad got married (not her) and just decided for her what relationship she was going to have with his new wife. Doesn\u2019t work like that. A lot of people view step mother as a close role considering you met this girl pretty old and married her father even older it makes sense that she sees you as dads wife not step mom. \n\nThis seems to be a huge power play going on here which is expected of her since she\u2019s a *child* you though, at your big age, should know better. Instead of coming in to \u201cenforce rules\u201d off the bat you should have started by just trying to be her friend. At 16 years old she doesn\u2019t really need you to enforce anything if her dad was able to do it alone for however many years he should be able to be a dad for a few more years and handle it himself.", "TA how come that the first thing of being a step mum you call \u201csetting the rules and punishments\u201d.

You are acting like you have no investment in her behavior and have no recourse just because you didn\u2019t make the rules, while you can and should be communicating appropriate boundaries. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t keep repeating yourself for her to go to her dad, especially when you knew her dad was in a meeting. You\u2019re basically washing your hands of her altogether instead of addressing the problem. Instead of sending her to her dad, tell her you will be happy to engage with her when she is being respectful. \n\nYou have every right to decline to give her money, but why didn\u2019t you talk to her about it? \u2018Well, I\u2019m not your mom and I won\u2019t give you money unless I know exactly what it\u2019s for.\u2019 \n\nTry talking to her with respect instead of just not dealing with her. If she starts to be rude, tell her you don\u2019t like being spoken to that way and that you will be here for her if she wants to be respectful.", "So your husband asked you to follow his rules about his daughter, then proceeds to allow her to verbally abuse you and gets mad at you for not handling her, when it is no longer convenient for him to do so? He can't cut you off at the knees by telling you you can't discipline his precious girl, then be mad when you don't. You need to communicate better as a family and you need to record the way she speaks to you on the off chance her father is unaware that his daughter is a major brat.", "NTA you can\u2019t have an adult conversation with an abusive adult let alone an abusive child. Your husband needs to parent his child. She should not be allowed to treat anyone the way she is treating you. This 100% your husband issue and 100% your step daughters issue. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t treat everyone she knows this way which means her behavior is a choice. \n\nYou have to make some hard choices (meaning doing something you don\u2019t want to do but for your own good) and set some hard boundaries.

You are definitely NTA for telling her to go to her dad for everything.", "NTA.", "NTA, your  husband is.   \n\n\nThis story is unclear. Since he was a single father, how is it your did not meet his daughter for a year? Father states \"You WILL be her brand new step-mother!\". Father states \"Ana! You will learn to love your mother replacement\". \"I have it all figured out.\"  \n\n\nBut then? Why did you willingly marry into this mess?", "Nope, NTA. But you need to have a serious conversation with your husband about communication and him having your back when it comes to this girl.\n\nMy mother would have beat my ass if I had talked to my stepdad like that!", "NTA. Your husband however is by pretending not to see other people's suffering because he doesn't want to deal. If you gave her the $100, you would be rewarding her horrible behavior. I am going to guess that she has some awareness of how she is acting and maybe it is buried deep, but her self image is taking a hit and if she continues, she will pay the price in other relationships. Dad has to see that his girl is having a very real problem and you are not it. You are just the target for all the feelings she cannot identify and manage. It is DAD's job to help her as she wont be receptive to your help and I suspect it is dad she really wants attention from in a way she might not be able to vocalize. Your husband is neglecting not only his daughter, but his new wife needs in blending his family.", "Record these interactions.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It is completely unacceptable how she talks to you.  Having said that, she's 16, not 6. And you're not her mother. She gets to decide what role you play in her life, no matter what you ir her dather wants. \n\nAnd she seems to have decided you're just dads new wife. Not step mom. Not a parent. Not any time of authority figure or role model. And that's OK.  \n\nThe good news is that means you have no responsibility towards her, from cooking to playing taxi, and you sure as hell don't have to give her money. But that also means she doesn't owe you any explanations, and you're not going to be telling her what to do (or at least you're just be wasting your breath if you try). Enjoy the freedom and let her dad worry about her.", "NTA but your husband is failing her and you both. This isn\u2019t sustainable.", "NTA- you don\u2019t have to give her money. You\u2019re not her mother, remember?", "NTA. Your husband should not be allowing his daughter to talk to you like that. \n\nIf Ana doesn't need to tell you what she needs the money for because you are not her mother, then you do not have to give her money because you are not her mother. You should told her that her father was in a meeting and could not be disturbed, so if she cannot be bothered to tell you what she needed the money for, she could talk to him later. \n\nIf your husband does not insist that his daughter treats you with respect, I would be out of that hell house. No one should have to live like that.", "NTA But it also sucks that your husband doesn't seem to be on your side at all. Sounds like a miserable marriage/relationship all around. There's no way I'm going to tolerate being screamed at by a child.", "Is your husband worth being treated like his by his daughter, and him by extension, for the rest of your life?", "\"Now my husband is mad at me for letting her interrupt his meeting and says I should've just acted like an adult and had an adult conversation with Ana.\"\n\nAnd would an adult have just handed her money because she demanded it and insulted them when asked what the money was for?!\n\nYour husband needs to step, up be an adult, and parent his child.\n\nNTA", "Your husband needs to act like a father.

It's only been 6 months, do you want to try and deal with this for the rest of your husband's and Ana's life?

It doesn't work like thst with 16 year old teens you just met. Op came in guns blazing and it blew up in her face. Frankly the step mom role ship has sailed at this point.
