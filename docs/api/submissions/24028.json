Everyone has fixated on her looks her whole life. \n\nI know I\u2019m a nice person and would do anything for anybody, I also try to find the joy in everything and stay positive in any situation and I\u2019m always smiling. \nI\u2019d give anyone my last penny whilst my sister stole from our dying parents. \n\nI\u2019ve always had very attractive partners and when I got married multiple people asked him what he was doing with me. \n\nWomen flirt with him directly in front of me because they are pretty and feel they are better then me. \n\nMy sister even has tried to take every boyfriend and my husband from me and couldn\u2019t understand why they weren\u2019t interested.  \n\nI think personality and character and kindness affect looks. If you go out and laugh and have fun and embrace life it\u2019s infectious. \nIf you think you are better then everyone and rely on just your looks then once people see through them you become less attractive. \n\nDuring school I had two best friends, two of us were ordinary looking but my friend was a successful model. \nWhen we went out together and met men they were terrified to approach her and when they did they just wanted a trophy. \nShe told us she hated being beautiful and later married an ordinary looking farmer and now lives in wellies in the countryside with no make up and she\u2019s even more beautiful because she\u2019s happy. \n\nOP sounds so bitter about her perceived plainness and has such a chip on her shoulder that I imagine she does come across as ugly. \n\nAnyone can make the best of themselves as well, look at the before and after make up videos on Facebook and TikTok. \n\nBut no one wants to open a prettily wrapped package to find an empty box do they?", "i love this quote so much, i printed it out and put it on my locker at work. it\u2019s a reminder for myself as well as anyone else who sees it", "Mine used to say that pretty is physical, but true beauty is of the spirit,", "I love that", "LOL, I had to recheck that this was AITA.\n\nHER: AITA?\n\nEVERYONE ELSE: YES!\n\nHER: HOW DARE YOU JUDGE ME !!!", "No redeeming qualities whatsoever.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Blame her mom for not passing down her superior looks! Selfish mom hogging all the genes /s\n\nI mean if OP is gonna be ridiculous, let\u2019s get ridiculous.", "Sounds like she does, she mentions her mom's low standards as a problem too.", "Oh it is because she\u2019s ugly. It probably seeps out of her pores. Her poor dad.", "Is NF neurofibromatosis? Is so, yikes, I'm sorry, that's so painful.", "I don't think even an incel would go near someone like that \n\nThey don't typically like their ugliness being pointed out to them \n\nThough I suppose, in a paradox, that makes them perfect for each other? 2 uggos ugging it up!", "I don't even believe this is real. If it is, no doubt about the problem.\n\nOP, YTA", "What do you mean? Ugly people can find love and get married.", "Yes I agree, its a brilliant quote and it's so true. I know OP has stopped replying but I really hope she sees that quote and it makes her reflect and realise that its not all about looks, it's the inside that counts.", "And I bet even if he's the world's most hideous human, he's probably got a heart of gold and *that's* probably what attracted the mum to him \n\nLike the Hunchback of Notre Dame", "I definitely agree with that. I don't bother with make up or anything, the only thing I really do is dye my hair and do my nails but I do them for me, not others.", "Ugly people run the world. It's all about perspective.", "Same!", "Yeah, I'm pretty ugly too, but, my hair is the one thing I love about myself. I've been dying it since I was 15. I used to dye it red for 6 months, them brown for six months. The last 5 years, it's been red only and I'm growing out. I get compliments all the time, but, like you, I color it because I like how it looks on me. It makes me happy, and that's all that's important.", "Thats quite true actually, alot of the most influential and most powerful figures in history and but also right now are not supermodels, they are just average looking people."]}
