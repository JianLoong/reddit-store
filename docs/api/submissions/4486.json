{"id": 4486, "submission_id": "ziuvg8", "title": "AITA for wanting to demand that my son's baseball coach stops benching him?", "selftext": "My (32F) son (8M, almost 9) plays baseball in a team with other kids his age. They have weekly practices and ocasional games with other teams. He had fun during practices at first but the reality it is that he is really bad. The coach tried to help him but he totally failed. Now they mostly let him play by himself with a ball during practices so he doesn't slow down everyone else. He has never played during a game a single time in the 10 months he has been part of this team.\n\nThe issue is that my son doesn't seem to care about any of this and it is not because he doesn't care about the sport itself. He loves baseball. He loves going to every practice, never misses a single one. He gets crazy excited everytime they play a game. He cheers for his team from the bench as the biggest fan.\n\nI don't like any of this at all, I feel he is developing a real loser mentality. I want to demand for the coach to let him play and if he doesn't I want to move him to a different team where they can help him be better. My husband thinks that as long as our kid is happy, there is no issue and doesn't think we shouldn't do anything.\n\nMy son clearly does not want me to complain at all. He says he knows he is bad and does not want to damage the team playing during a game. He does also not want to change team and says he already has friends in this team but I have my doubts about that. I have never seen the other kids being too friendly with him, they mostly just ignore him. \n\nMy strong and insistant position about the need to change this situation her became a source of conflict with my husband.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1670770101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ziuvg8/aita_for_wanting_to_demand_that_my_sons_baseball/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That he **PREFERS** not having the pressure of playing during a game (and potentially missing a ground ball, or striking out at bat), and that going to practice and the camaraderie are what he loves?\n\nYou are \"that parent\" the coaches talk about.

It's a you problem. Apparently his happiness doesn't matter to you. Get therapy before he needs to.\n\nIn the meantime you could just try to get him some help outside of the team.

There's no guarantee that he'll be any better playing on another team but he sure will miss his team and not be as happy.\n\nBeing responsible for losing games will do nothing for him or the team, quite the opposite, so why the fixation with him playing if he's admittedly \"bad\"?\n\nBesides, he's only 8!

The kid is probably beat down by not being able to participate fully in even practices. \n\nThe coach is an AH for allowing the kid to go off on his own during practice.

It\u2019s like signing him up for a summer camp where they teach you skills but when you show up your kid is happy but playing alone in a sandbox. Sure they had fun but they didn\u2019t get the actual experience. Plus it\u2019s just a disservice to the kid. I played pee wee football and every kid starts off terrible. If they refuse to teach him and instead just let him be there and do nothing its not letting him actually experience it. It\u2019s be one thing if they let him practice as normal and taught him skills but didn\u2019t let him play as he was learning, which is not only fine but to be expected. But it sounds like they wrote him off as a trash player and are doing the bare minimum to teach him.", "You absolutely are the arsehole.\n\nYour son enjoys it, let him be. \n\nYTA!", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s wild that the 9 year old is more mature than the adult.", "YTA. I get that it\u2019s frustrating and I wouldn\u2019t be happy about it if he didn\u2019t get at least real practice so that he\u2019s not wasting his time being there. I mean, you can be bad and on the bench all real plays but still get training to get better on practice.\n\nBut it\u2019s your son\u2019s decision to make. If he feels OK with it and doesn\u2019t want to change team, then let it be. He clearly goes because he likes a lot of other stuff about doing baseball. He appreciate being part of a team, making friends, having regular sessions all together.\n\nI don\u2019t get at all why you\u2019d think that has anything to do with loser mentality. It\u2019s just one sport out of a billion things he\u2019ll do in life. He\u2019s probably great at many other things and is conscious of it. The only challenge you should be pushing your kids into is to try their best in anything they do.

The thread is filled with explanations about why Y T A, but coach is an AH too. Writing a kid off at this age is so rude. Everyone should get a chance to play when they are that young.", "I think YWBTA if you demand the coach do something, but I do think a conversation is warranted. I\u2019d be concerned with who made your son feel like playing in a game would make him a burden to the team. The whole point of youth leagues like this is for everyone to learn and get a chance to play. There are more advanced/competitive leagues for a reason as well that typically require players to try out for. Showing yo to practice every day & trying his best should be all this coach requires to allow him the opportunity to play.", "You're the ass. Your son is happy. Don't ruin that for him. He's not great at it, he knows this. He's so young, don't take something great from your kid, bc you want something else for him.  You stepping in shows him that he's not good enough for you.  Don't do that to your son.", "YWBTA\n\nThis sort of parenting is why I quit coaching. Loved the kids but some of the parents were awful and forgot that it\u2019s a volunteer league and the whole point is for the kids to have fun.", "YTA.\n\nHe doesn't have a loser mentality. You are projecting your wishes on him. Is he happy? Then don't ruin it for him.", "YTA. Your son is learning that he won\u2019t be good at everything and that he\u2019s not a quitter.

It sucks when they are benched but there are life lessons there like keep improving in practice and someday you get to play. Be an amazing teammate etc. your son is building some character already from your post. All winter my sons teams had some indoor practice. See if you can find some of that. Maybe he will get good or maybe he will find he likes another sport better.", "YTA\n\nThere is nothing else for me to say here.", "I don't why everyone is calling YTA, but I have a feeling that you are reading between the lines and there is something that may be your child is not telling you, there is no smoke without fire and your child does think he plays bad and will do harm for the team if he plays in the real game, so somewhere you are not wrong in your assumption, I think you would have to have some small small day to day talks with your child (not directly) , he won't tell you anything, warm him up to you regarding these things slowly, then ask him", "Tough position OP. I can understand your point, it's a team of 9-year-olds, everyone should be able to play, no matter how much they suck, it's not like they're playing the World Series.\n\n**But** your kid seems to enjoy it the way it is. Demanding the coach to make him play may create some issues within the team that could cause the other kids to resent your son, making the enjoyable part of being in the team go away.\n\nI say leave it as it is as long as he's happy. He goes to practice and enjoys games, which is the whole point.\n\nSoft YTA because your kid expressed he's ok, I say respect that.", "NTA - you not for wanting to demand.. you would be for actually demanding\u2026\n\nI have been in your shoes\u2026 my kid sucked at baseball\u2026 he liked being with his friends, but he was terrible at the game.\n\nDo not demand the coach put him in. It will just create all kinds of unintended consequences and it isn\u2019t going to help your son.\n\nDo get him to try other sports or activities besides baseball.  Every kid needs to be well rounded and doing different things.  At his age we did spray and pray\u2026 tried different things every season until he found the things he wanted to stay involved with.  By trying other activities, your son will get to experience what he likes and doesn\u2019t like.  My son excelled at martial arts, music, and track\u2026. The baseball thing fell by the wayside when he got more involved in other activities where he had friends and did well at the activity.\n\nIf your son is only in baseball, then he doesn\u2019t have any other choices and he will stay because it\u2019s something for him to do.  So find other activities to get him involved in in addition to baseball.  I would suggest martial arts, scouting, and a different team sport.", "NTA for wanting to talk to the coach. YWBTA if you talk to him when your son doesn\u2019t want you to.\n\nIf he loves baseball support him how ever you can and don\u2019t spoil the love by intervening. He is also at a young age and might just not be as developed with coordination yet. If you want to help, get some whiffle balls, large and standard size plastic bats. They damage almost nothing and they tend to move slower and a tee or soft toss gets hand-eye coordination up to speed. \n\nAlso, maybe he\u2019s not an athlete and that\u2019s okay too! I had friends on baseball teams growing up that we\u2019re just as much part of the team and didn\u2019t play in games often, but loved the game and would do the scorebook as a way to be engaged in the game! \n\nEven on competitive teams, the team atmosphere is very fun and typically light hearted and it sounds like your kid is a STUD of a teammate supporting everyone during the games which is the main point I got from it!", "If you are paying for your son to be on this team, I would say that you have some right to encourage more use of your son. Now, I am not saying the coach has to put him in a game, but he damn sure should not be handed a ball and put off to the side during practices. That\u2019s not acceptable as the kid is not going to get better if he has no practice. YWBTA if you try and force a coach to put somebody, who you have stated by your own words, cannot play, into a game which is being played to win. If anything you should take up with the coach why he thinks it\u2019s okay to permanently place an 8yr old boy on the sidelines as being \u201cbad\u201d when he is EIGHT YEARS OLD. He has a decade to get better and if he loves the game he will soak up anything which is handed to him to become better. But only if it is handed to him. Being put on the sidelines in practice WILL make him feel worthless, but he will be even more embarrassed if his mother forces him into a game he has now been conditioned to feel he has no right playing in. You need to get his mentality to a place where he feels he can better himself.", "\"*Now they mostly let him play by himself with a ball during practices so he doesn't slow down everyone else.*\"\n\nI'll meet you halfway and agree that I'd be pissed to know that my son was being left to his own devices during practice... that's not what good teams do. However, demanding he play is always an AH move, *especially* when your child doesn't want you to do so. Talk with your child about ways he could practice at home to help improve, and encourage him to advocate for himself to be more involved at practice. This is a wonderful learning opportunity for your child and talking with, let alone making demands to the coach, would be squandering it.", "NTA your son is a member of the team. As long as he is trying his best and not being purposefully disruptive he should be participating in all practice activities, not shifted off to the side to amuse himself. That is horrible coaching. Assuming this is a basic fun league and not a seriously competitive league, at this age all kids should be rotated into the game and at different positions. If it were my kid I would be looking for a different team or league. But maybe find a different sport if you think he will truly never improve in skill. He could still enjoy going and watching games if that is the part he likes best.", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say NTA\n\nI played ball as a kid and there was never a kid that wasn't involved. At his age involvement is what matters most. It seems like pretty bad coaching to just give up on this kid. I would definitely talk to someone higher in the league because that is not normal in that age range.", "YTA. Your son is happy with his hobby that he loves. And your first reaction is: I have to change that. \n\nBut good luck with the parents of the better players the coach would have to bench instead. I am sure this would go completely drama free\u2026", "YTA First your kid is enjoying it so let him continue on this team.  \n\nSecond, he is young and hand eye coordination happens at different rates at that age especially when they are growing. \n\nThird what have you done to help your kid improve his skills?  No kid is going to improve simply by attending a couple of practices a week. Coaches at practices can only do so much with multiple kids and most of it is teaching the kids how to improve but the kids have to work at it on their own time too.  He needs daily practice at home too.  Do you or your husband spend any time playing catch or pitching balls to him so he can practice his catching, throwing and batting skills outside of practice?  I guarantee most of the rest of the kids on that team are getting that help from parents or siblings when not at practice, and probably started doing all that a few years ago.  \n\nSo start with playing baseball with your kid at home.  Throw balls back and forth for fun.  Make sure he has a bat at home to use and let him keep hitting balls you throw.  His skills will improve over time, but keep it fun for him. Don't pressure and don't criticize during home practice.", "NTA\n\nControversial opinion, but you are presumably paying for your child to play the game - not being left to amuse himself during practice and play cheerleader during the actual games. I doubt this is a competitive league either because otherwise they would have checked he could play before accepting him, and non-competitive leagues at this age are normally centered around giving every child a chance to play regardless of talent.\n\nIt's great he's having a good time and I disagree with your point about loser mentality, but the coach needs to put him in the game sometimes.", "You WOULD not only be the ahole, you ARE the ahole. If you, as a parent, believe that in this situation your son is developing a \u201closer mentality\u201d, I fear for the rest of your son\u2019s upbringing. \n\nYTA. \n\nINFO: What is more important than your kid being happy?", "So imagine this scenario.. you insist, coach gives in and let\u2019s him play, son gets put in right field, misses every ball, can\u2019t throw it far enough to do anything, etc. so now all of his teammates hate him, start teasing him, mocking him, etc. How do you think that\u2019s going to make him feel? As things stand now, your son loves baseball, loves being part of a team and participates from the sidelines. Which scenario sounds better to you? YTA", "YTA. He's a kid - not a loser. WTH is wrong with you. If he's getting nothing out of this group, then look for another team with a coach who actually wants to help youngsters improve their skill sets and work together as a team, maybe? Send him to a baseball camp where he can get more 1:1 attention that focuses on his development, maybe? Anything but blame a little kid for not being Aaron Judge in an 8-year-old's body.\n\nMy godson went to the NBA and is now a retiree as a very young man. No one imagined he'd be over 6 feet before he was 12 years old. No one at his high school knew how to fine tune his skill set and truly help him develop into a stellar athlete. (His mom worked out and played with him endlessly and she sent him to every basketball camp opportunity she found and she had him playing intramural sports and semi pro with area college kids and minor league standouts. He loved basketball and she was helping him get as much as he could out of those private experiences.)\n\nSo, lots of 'coaches' won't know how to develop talent along with passion in young children. C'mon. That's when parents dig deeper into themselves and find better opportunities for their children to develop. All your kid really needs is to love the game and decide for himself why he loves it and what he gets out of it. I have a nephew who has loved baseball since he stepped out of the womb. He was never the best on the field until he had time to practice, practice and practice. He has a scholarship to play baseball in college right now. And no one ever thought he was a loser when he wasn't a standout with little skill.", "NTA.\n\nHe's 9 he should play in a game. \n\nIt doesn't matter if does poorly or not.", "Also remember the kid still shows up to training trying to get better.", "Nta. Eve if he sucks, he needs to play part of the game. Just bc your son doesn't seem to care doesn't mean he doesn't. Maybe he just accepted that he doesn't get to play. I would 100% say something if my son never played in a game.", "How about instead to talk to the coach and ask him how can you help your son improve? \n\nDon\u2019t move him, he is having the time of his live, but you are correct that he should get some action, but it shouldn\u2019t be to the detriment of his friends, and he should 100% be part of the practices. If he isn\u2019t then the coach is not doing his job..", "Here's my two cents as a one time middle school coach.  YWBTA if you straight up just went in and demanded the coach to play your son.  I absolutely hated parents that came up and got an attitude about their kid not getting enough play time.  \n\nI donated my time to teach your kids how to play a sport, I know their level of play, and I always made sure every kid had play time that wanted to play and yes I did have a small handful of kid that weren't comfortable but I worked with them to get comfortable.  \n\nI always responded better and made notes of the parents who weren't acting like Karens with demanding their kid play more.\n\nI would suggest talking more with your kid and see if he wants more play time and if he does talk to the coach in a respectful manner that your kid would like more play time even if it's toward the end of the game and work with him to improve his skills.\n\nETA, honestly I think that the kid coach of also an asshole for not playing your kid regardless of skill, I always played every kid, even if it's just for a single rotation and always included everyone in practice regardless of skill because they're young and they need time to develop.", "The coach is going to think it's weird that you're calling him when it's not baseball season.", "YWBTA because your son doesn't want you to interfere, but after this season is over I would look for a new league where everyone gets to play. Some leagues are more competitive than others and some are just to make sure everyone has a turn.", "YTA because you\u2019re complaining about the wrong thing. Only a bad coach would leave a kid on his own during a practice. \n\nIt\u2019s LITERALLY the coaches to job to make sure the players are growing in the sport. The fact that he just lets your son play by himself is horrible. \n\nFind a coach that will actually go to bat for your son. Because that\u2019s what a real coach will do.", "YTA, especially as you kid seems content. I do think you should push the coach to include him more in practice with the team. Also, maybe ask if there is some other role he can contribute during games? Can he help keep track of statistics or be a coach\u2019s assistant in some way? It seems clear he likes being part of the team, but understands he isn\u2019t a great baseball player.", "I'm going to assume that you're paying for this.\n\nNTA and, honestly, if you'd phrased your issue differently, I'm 100% sure that people here would praise you to high heaven for looking after your son.\n\nTo tone you've written this post with is really unpleasant, but, at the end of the day, your son's coach can't just decide to take your money and then focus on the kids that are already good enough at the sport. If he doesn't think your son is good enough to receive proper coaching, he shouldn't allow him to be a part of the team. And your son cannot become good if he is not even allowed to play with the rest.\n\nAnd you're right - your son should learn that it's not OK to let others take advantage of him, even if they're friendly with him. If they're happy to take your money, they should play with him and allow him to practice properly. How exactly is your son going to become good at the sport, if they don't allow him to practice with the others, if he only practices by himself and never plays a game?\n\nAnd yours son probably says he doesn't want you to complain, because he doesn't want his \"friends\" to turn against him because of a game. You should not accept this, though. You should not allow him to think he is unworthy.", "ESH. The coach should let your kid play sometimes. You making that kind of demand would be embarrassing. Are you able to find him personal coaching or tools to help get better on his own? To stay on the team despite his lack of skill is impressive! He's a winner in my book", "I would let him finish out the season with this team, because he likes it. However next season. I would put him I.

He knows he\u2019s not good so he doesn\u2019t want to hurt the team\u2019s scores! Makes sense to me\u2026 \n\nSounds like he has more sense that his parent. At least the one posting. You\u2019re being very cruel to him. Another team isn\u2019t going to help him. He obviously knows he\u2019s not good. And that\u2019s ok!!

They have weekly practices and ocasional games with other teams. He had fun during practices at first but the reality it is that he is really bad. The coach tried to help him but he totally failed. Now they mostly let him play by himself with a ball during practices so he doesn't slow down everyone else. He has never played during a game a single time in the 10 months he has been part of this team.\n\nThe issue is that my son doesn't seem to care about any of this and it is not because he doesn't care about the sport itself. He loves baseball. He loves going to every practice, never misses a single one. He gets crazy excited everytime they play a game. He cheers for his team from the bench as the biggest fan.\n\nI don't like any of this at all, I feel he is developing a real loser mentality. I want to demand for the coach to let him play and if he doesn't I want to move him to a different team where they can help him be better. My husband thinks that as long as our kid is happy, there is no issue and doesn't think we shouldn't do anything.\n\nMy son clearly does not want me to complain at all. He says he knows he is bad and does not want to damage the team playing during a game. He does also not want to change team and says he already has friends in this team but I have my doubts about that. I have never seen the other kids being too friendly with him, they mostly just ignore him. \n\nMy strong and insistant position about the need to change this situation her became a source of conflict with my husband.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can\u2019t teach all eight year olds to be good at anything. The coach does not perform miracles.\n\nTo ask for a different coach is not going to help your situation, and you demanding that? That a little kids\u2019 little baseball league hear and give into your demands for a new coach? You keep this up and you\u2019ll get yourself banned from games. You\u2019ll make every sport your kid plays miserable.\n\nLeave him alone. Let him have fun. Let him be a kid.\n\nAnd don\u2019t ever tell your kid he\u2019s developing a loser mentality. Ever. Nobody cares who wins baseball games at this age. Nobody.", "INFO: Can your husband practice with him?", "YTA", "YTA. Your son is happy and having fun.", "ESH, except your kid of course. At this age baseball is about learning how to play. He should be participating in practice at the least. Some leagues in that age range have minimum play time for a player. (Example: each player must get at least 1 full inning of play time each game, or something along those lines).  Your kid is not even getting practice time.  Look into the league rules. \n\nYou're the AH because of the \"loser mentality\" comment. Maybe your kid has realized that while he loves baseball, he may not be good at it. That's ok. We can't all be star athletes.  But what are you doing to help your son? Do either your husband or yourself play catch with him? I didn't see any mention of either of you trying to help him.\n\nThe coach is an AH because he's coaching everyone on the team except for your son. He's a shitty coach.", "YTA for ur reasoning ofc.\n\nBut I\u2019d ask the coach to throw him in once just to give him the experience. Maybe he\u2019ll like it maybe he won\u2019t. Let him try.", "YTA.", "YTA.\n\nThe correct thing to do here is to let your son attend games in whatever capacity he likes, for as long as he likes. In the meantime, have some relaxed, happy conversations about other things that interest him. If he's always asking about kitchen tools, maybe he wants to learn to cook. If he likes digging in the yard, maybe he would like a little garden for himself. If he's an animal lover, maybe he can volunteer at a rescue to play with kittens. Whatever. But forcing his coach to play him when he's perfectly happy as things are is only going to make him uncomfortable, and make you the laughingstock of all the other ridiculous sports parents. Relax and let him be a child. PS, the only \"loser mentality\" he's learning is from you.", "YTA.\n\nNow, if your son would LIKE to get better, there's nothing stopping you from throwing the ball around at home, but it sounds like he's having a great time in a team environment.", "That sounds noble from the kid, but honestly I do get OP perspective as well somewhat. Like, this kid is showing up to every practice and game, and supporting the team. The coaches are 100% failing to find a way to get him into the game and playing. They're 9, the goal is to support each other and work together. \n\nFor everyone (kid included) just to give up and settle for the fact that this kid cannot ever add any value during a game just sucks. I'm not sure about \"loser mentality\", but I suspect the coach deserves some scrutiny here.", "\"why'd you make me play second base?!\"", "I think it\u2019d be awesome if the coach explores with her son what he *is* good at. Maybe he is good with numbers, or seeing others strengths/weaknesses, let him see there\u2019s more to baseball than just the field. If he\u2019s not interested in any of that it\u2019s still okay, but exploring it at least is a good idea.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He knows he's not good at baseball but he enjoys it nonetheless, why won't you let him have this?", "Yeah, the practice part in particular really bothers me. These are 8-9 year olds, even if OP's kid is literally the worst 8 year old baseball player of all time if he's willing and enthusiastic and actually trying then I can't see how including him in drills would be *such* a drag that it can't ever happen. This isn't a travel team and it doesn't sound like tryouts were involved, it's a recreational team for fairly young kids. I think focusing on a \"developing a loser mentality\" is the wrong point, but I really don't have a lot of respect for this coach if he thinks basically ignoring a kid and leaving him out of *everything* is appropriate at this level and age group.", "Soft YTA. But the coach is also a huge ahole. Mainly if he is shoved to the side all by himself every practice. If it is pay to play. All kids should get playing time.", "I agree with you. No, the kid should not be pressured to play if he doesn't want to. But the coach is the one who created the environment where this kid already thinks he can't even practice with the team without worrying about dragging them down somehow. A big part of sports at this age and level is learning sportsmanship, and \"it's okay to exclude this kid completely even at practice because he's bad\" is an absolutely terrible lesson for everyone involved. I'm impressed that OP's kid has found a positive way to deal with it and is still enjoying himself, but if the coach was doing his job then the poor kid would not be having thoughts like \"if I play I'll ruin things for everyone else\" in the first place.", "I have doubts about that part of her story. As others have said, at that age, all the kids on the team play. I bet her \u201cnever lets my kid play\u201d is actually the coach not letting her kid play as much as she wants him to play.", "Yeah this is my thought. Kid might know he\u2019s bad and doesn\u2019t want to be in a game to embarrass himself.  \n\nBut shunting him aside at practice is not ok.  They are 9. All the kids need to participate and learn.  \n\nAlso where is OP and spouse here?  Like if my kid loved something and was terrible at it, I\u2019d be trying to help them at home too. Like figure out how to help the kid improve. \n\nSo I\u2019m going ESH here. Mom you suck and would\u2019ve be ta if you press for him to play. But coach is also terrible here.", "Yup. Unless the OP is omitting something, this sounds like a rec team which at that age is just as much about getting the kids playing as it is teaching any sport related skills. \n\nI played house league/rec soccer for years as a kid. I wasn't any good at it but they still put me on the field. Kids not being great at the sport comes with the rec/house league territory.", "I\u2019m seeing red flags where OP says the kids ignore him and he says he has friends. Is he neurodivergent? Does he get bullied in school? What makes him so happy with being ignored?", "It says the kid has never played in a game. That's the whole issue. At least give the kid an at bat.", "Didn\u2019t say the other kids ignore him, she said they let him practice by himself. You can be really good friends with someone but not do every activity together. The kids can all like each other, talk about whatever kids talk about and share their interests, even hangout with each other outside of games and practice but at the same time during practice want to focus on training that OP\u2019s son isn\u2019t up to snuff enough to be an asset. \n\nImage they\u2019re doing a simple catch drill and OP\u2019s son never catches easy tosses and can\u2019t throw the ball in the right direction for the other kid.

That\u2019s when he\u2019d be talking with his friends. Also a community youth team like this is more than likely populated by his classmates and neighbors, where he can hangout with them without her seeing. She most likely wouldn\u2019t have a good angle or be near enough to see what he\u2019s doing during a game since parents are kept away. So likely she\u2019s coloring her perspective solely on what she sees during practice", "> The issue is that my son doesn't seem to care about any of this and it is not because he doesn't care about the sport itself. He loves baseball. He loves going to every practice, never misses a single one. He gets crazy excited everytime they play a game. He cheers for his team from the bench as the biggest fan. \n\nSeems like he like baseball, not playing baseball. \nDon't get so obsessed over it, it's not going to help anyone. \nYTA", "Yta", "NTA for your feelings.  \n\n\nYou're not even ta if you discuss it with the coach in a reasonable way.  You would, however, be ta  if you go about DEMANDING anything like that from a little league coach.\n\nMy son also was rather dismal at sports as a young'n.

Unless he's actually griping and wanting to be more of a player, let him be.   \n\n\nFor the record.  My son did \"git gud\" in Jr. High and HS, just in different types of sports.  He's also crazy talented music wise (he's self-taught in several instruments).   I was very much the same way.  Not good at hand-eye coordination type sports like softball, but I was a really good dancer and good at gymnastics.  Even those though, I just wasn't interested enough to be a disciplined contender.  \n\nI didn't really find my passion until later in life, and then I glommed onto it like crazy.  Some of us are just late bloomers too.\n\nHe's his own person, if he's happy, let him develop his own sense of self.

Why spoil that for him?  The only thing that will happen if he plays is that he will be embarrassed and then never want to go again. Face the facts, OP. You can\u2019t live out your life through your son. No one cares if he\u2019s an athlete or not.", "Can he be an equipment manager or assistant to the coach?

But demanding he enter the games when he's not ready is not going to help him improve.", "YTA.  \n\nHow will forcing a coach to play your child help your child feel like a winner?  Are you assuming that your kid putting his lack of baseball talent on display, and having teammates resent his dragging down the score will make him feel good?\n\nWe all have strengths and weaknesses.  If you want your child to taste success, don\u2019t teach him that forcing people to give him a place is his avenue to self confidence.  Instead help him find HIS way to experience success.\n\nFigure out why he is so bad at the game.  Exactly what does he do that isn\u2019t working and then address that with whatever help he needs.\n\nIs he missing too many swings?  Is he unable to control a pitch?  Does he have trouble running bases or following the rules of the game.  Lots of things can amiss here.  Maybe he needs glasses.  Maybe he needs occupational therapy to learn coordination and right movements. Etc.  Have an OT watch him go through the motions.\n\nIf, after that, it isn\u2019t going to get better, consider letting him try lots of activities until he finds one he can work at well.  Baseball is a team sport.  It may help him succeed by learning a sport that is not about a team but foes have a community.  Horse back riding, snow boarding, swimming, golf, etc.  \n\nMeanwhile let him hang out at baseball as long as he enjoys it.
