We have been together for 7 months (we are both 26). During the time that I have known I have seen him forgetting important birthdays, dates, he even gets confused about what day of the week is.\n\nToday it was his graduation, I was not able to attend because I was working but last week he invited me to go and have a celebration lunch with his family after the graduation. He even reminded me yesterday and today he texted me \u201cI will let you know the name of the place\u201d \nSo, I got all dolled up but never heard from him so I texted him around 5 PM and he told me that he \u201cforgot\u201d to let me know, that they have already had lunch and he said \u201cit was not a big deal\u201d because it was only him and his parents and that he was busy with all the graduation and just forgot about me.\n\nI got very sad, unfortunately I am a very sensitive person. He offered to pick me up at night and to have dinner with me since I was all dressed up but I told him I didn\u2019t want to. He apologized but said that I made him feel bad during his graduation day and that I was overreacting. Now he is upset and is not speaking to me.\n\nThis is the second time that something like this happens, 2 months ago, he invited me to a concert and I got ready just for him to forget it. Am I overreacting?\n\nEdit: I also want to clarify that the reason that i waited until 5 PM to ask him is because I knew that he was going to be busy with the graduation. I also don\u2019t think he forgot it because his mom knew that I was going.\n\nHe keeps telling me that it was not a big deal to him not to tell me because they just went to a random restaurant and had lunch like in 1 hour and that not even his brother went. What hurts me is that he didn\u2019t even bother to let me know about that. A part of me wants to break up but I didn\u2019t know if I was overreacting.", "created_utc": 1671185831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znbecz/aita_for_making_a_problem_about_something_small/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How did he not get to lunch and immediately think \u201cI forgot to message\u2026\u201d. Sorry I am all for forgetful but that is extremely rude. The fact that he is now making you the villain is even worse. Own up and admit he forgot and he is an ass and he will make it up and try be better, you don\u2019t jump to you made me feel bad so I will ignore you.

Unless bro has a medical condition, you might have some thinking to do.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone with medical memory issues I feel for him, and he should really seek help / diagnosis. Sometimes nomatter what you do your brain won't let you remember stuff and it sounds like you're being appropriately understanding and sensitive to that.\n\nOn the other hand his attitude towards the situation, telling you it's \"no big deal\" and not seeming to make any backups to help him with his bad memory (phone reminders, etc.) is not acceptable. He knows he has this issue and it only takes basic empathy for him to see how it's affecting you and probably others around him too. He is definitely being an AH here, not for forgetting but for making his memory issues everyone else's problem.", "NTA. He could have handled this in so many other ways; asking his parents to call you, telling you the place they were going to right from the start, setting an alarm, asked you to call him after graduation... Diagnosis or no diagnosis, he still could use coping strategies, especially if it's happened before. Just getting mad bc you're upset and ghosting you doesn't seem like the healthiest way to cope with his obvious issues.", "NTA, but concerning. Well, i do have memory issues too, so i can understand it. Especially until a year ago, i would forget whether i was going upstairs or downstairs, while i was on the stairs. My name, entire days, appointments, names etc. I also would constantly apologize and feel guilty for forgetting important things. Although not an expert, it happened to me during a time where i had mental issues that started getting really bad (dont worry its not a self diagnosis). Since he is inviting you and is trying to make up for forgetting, he may be actually forgetting. And also him not considering the possibility of not remembering your meetings can mean that he isnt aware of his forgetfulness yet, not enough to scare him from making an appointment with you. As i said, im not an expert, but his repeated forgetfulness and his will to actually make up to you may be a sign of an issue similar to mine.", "Brain might forget but the heart remembers.", "Info: has your bf been diagnoses for adult ADHD? \n\nBeyond your rightful feelings of sadness and resentment at being forgotten by him (and therefore you're NTA), these episodes are pretty worrying.", "NTA\n\nHe forgot about you?

You need to get out of this relationship because all I see is a future where he forgets to help with wedding olans, forgets to help his wife with chores, forgets about taking care of the kids.

Dick move.", "INFO (for my own understanding, you're NTA because being stood up is awful): does he have brain damage? I've had 4/5 concussions and after the last one it took me 4-6 months to be able to associate time passing with days of the week. Like I would understand that two days had passed and what that would mean for my work and classes but I would still think it was Monday every day and would assume my Monday schedule (like self imposed groundhog day, don't recommend) and had to be reminded it wasn't. I was lucky it wasn't permanent but I know others who have similar permanent difficulties due to worse concussions.", "NTA. Lady, you should sit him down and explain in no uncertain terms, that even if it is no big deal for him it is for you. Doling up and being left hanging is rude and not excusable with bad memory. If he has bad memory he can always set up an alarm in his mobile on vibration.\nBut 7 months? Girl, as an older man, here comes a free dad advice : bail out of there. The hurt coming your way from that guy will be many fold.

Focusing on himself yet he\u2019s the one who caused the problem. He needs professional help. He clearly can\u2019t figure this out on his own. Time to be an adult. Time to not expect people to feel hurt when he doesn\u2019t follow through and is ok that he keeps people waiting around. You mean to tell me he was sitting around eating, celebrating and forgot you existed, wow.", "NTA and it's not about memory issues. He might have forgotten to text you, but when he got there and realized you weren't there... A normal person would immediately call or text. He didn't.

People just say that when they want to treat you badly and then not be troubled by your response.  He wants to punish you with silence and make YOU feel guilty because of what HE did. Theres no good future with this guy. You\u2019re not his priority. If he was in love with you, you would be. Let him go.", "NTA\n\n\nI'd be very upset too. And you didn't ruin his graduation day, he upset you on his graduation day by being thoughtless and ignorant and is now dealing with the consequences of his actions.", "NAH you said he has major memory issues, so that's the reason, can't be mad at that", "Very slightly ESH. Him moreso, but why are you texting him during his graduation to find out where to go and when to meet? Surely that's information you need to know at least the day before. They met for lunch and you were ready for 5 - you were on completely different pages. You should have asked him for that information a week ago.", "I agree too. I think he didn\u2019t forget it, he just didn\u2019t want me there. Not sure why he invited me and why he texted me in the morning all excited about that. I\u2019m so confused and sad, just 2 days ago he said I love you for the first time and wants me to live with him next year (I won\u2019t do it obviously).", "Agreed! My husband was medically retired from the military and some of his side effects have been memory loss. He has a phone he has alarms set on his phone. He knows that he cant remember shit anymore and has so many different ways to remind him of things but he would never brush off a lunch with someone he cares about. Did his parents not know you were gonna go? If he has this bad memory his family would know and would have said something", "That\u2019s what I think unfortunately. His mom really likes me and she probably asked about me. Not sure why he invited me if he was going to leave me in the dark.", "It\u2019s a common symptom of ADHD. He may be undiagnosed and largely functional in school (getting very good grades) but suffered in attentiveness in other ways.  \n\nOP, if you really like him you need to talk to him about how this makes you feel and that you can\u2019t be in a relationship with him if this continues.  There are skills he can learn in therapy and online. If he wants to be with you, he needs to invest in making himself better. \n\nI\u2019m the boyfriend in this scenario and learned that I have to set an alarm on my phone or it won\u2019t happen, no matter how good my intention. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are my wife, kids or boss: I will not make the appointment if I don\u2019t have an alarm set (usually two: one about thirty minutes to an hour before leaving and one at the time to leave).", "Yes! To be honest, I have to ask him more details about that because yesterday he told me about his ADHD but now sure if he has been officially diagnosed. I try to be very empathic with him but it hurts me because I\u2019m not sure if he is just doing it on purpose.", "Exactly. You are NTA. Your feelings are valid. Anyone would be frustrated by that. You should discuss this with him in detail and have him checked mentally/medically to see what the issue is and if it can be helped or solved. If he gets diagnosed with something then he can decide to treat it and hopefully get better. That will show effort and maturity on his part and that he is trying and cares. Which is a good sign that it\u2019s safe to give him a chance. But it is ultimately up to both of you to work on the issue. And it is your choice if that is something you\u2019re willing to work on with him. Sometimes people just can\u2019t handle others who have those issues and that\u2019s fine and you should decide that if you can handle it or not if that\u2019s the case and talk about it openly and honestly with him. It\u2019s best not to waste each others time. People with mental illness can be too much for some people to handle and it\u2019s okay if they can\u2019t and choose to walk away as a result. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still be friends afterwards. That\u2019s what dating is all about. To see if you\u2019re both compatible and can work things out or not. And if you\u2019re willing to put up with certain issues or not.", "Exactly. People need to treat and take responsibility for themselves and any diagnosis they may have whether it\u2019s medical or mental. Yes, people can be supportive, but if the person with the mental illness or medical diagnosis isn\u2019t doing anything to treat themselves and to take responsibility for themselves and instead are making a nuisance of themselves and putting that on everyone else then that is an issue. And it\u2019s their issue. Not everyone else\u2019s issue. People can help, but help doesn\u2019t mean do all the work themselves.", "To be honest he did tell me yesterday but not sure if he has been diagnosed. Will have to ask!", "Maybe because he is a thoughtless asshole and you deserve better?You do deserve better btw.", "Please read 'why does he do that' by Lundy bancroft. What he's doing seems to be a power play meant to devalue you slowly - all while keeping you hooked by telling you he loves you and whatnot.\n\nHe got upset after you got upset even though it's his fault, which is shifting the blame from him to you and is meant to absolve him of the consequences of his shitty actions while making you reassure him.\n\nNone of this really matters though, only this: is this relationship acceptable for you? I don't think it is and if you are looking for a sign to leave him, consider this it.good luck!", "Sooooo your bf forgets what day of the week it is often and you've decided that it's way more likely he didn't want you at a lunch rather than the way more plausible reason of he forgot?\n\nWhy are you trying to place malice on this?", "Absolutely.", "Because it gives him power over you.", "This is why I don't think it matters if the BF has a medical condition or is simply an ah: you have similar problems and you try. If it doesn't work, you find solutions and (I assume) you accept it if others are rightfully upset when you forget something. (I have similar problems and try my best to do the same because it does make a difference when we fuck up and people can see that we tried) \n\nOPs BF doesn't do any of that. That's why you are married while ops BF is not relationship material", "Oh hun. My best friend has severe adhd, she cannot survive without her medication and still gets forgetful/chaotic. She's never, not once, forgotten about our plans. She's never made me feel like she's forgotten about me. And we're just friends! This is meant to be your partner. If he keeps forgetting about you and taking your empathy for his condition for granted, he's not a partner. He needs to manage this, much like people with much worse conditions manage it.\n\nSource: I have a chronic illness too. I don't make it anyone else's problem, and I don't expect people to accommodate me.", "This is an aspect that absolutely needs to be investigated.  \n\nAt the moment you rightly feel neglected and unimportant to him because he forgets you.  But if it was ADHD he wouldn't do it on purpose. And, good news, once diagnosed, ADHD can be brought under control and the patient's life improves (because I'm sure if your bf is so distracted even at work, his bosses aren't happy).", "Listen to this. This is not a bad memory, this is manipulation big time. Then he makes it your fault. Please!!\n\nIf his memory is so bad, how did he get a degree?  How did he manage to get assignments done. Dump this a&& hat, you deserve better."]}
