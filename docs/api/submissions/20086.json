A lot of context is needed so bear with me. \n\nMy (32f) husband (32m) was divorced from his first wife almost six years ago. We met two years after the divorce and have married earlier this year. For identification I\u2019ll call my husband A and his ex wife (30f) L. A and L had no children or assets from their marriage, in fact infertility was a source of conflict in their marriage (fertility testing showed both parties to have dysfunction causing reduced fertility but not sterility) A has told me that he is no contact with L because she never respected his boundaries during their marriage and continued to push boundaries after the marriage ended. My understanding is that she wanted to continue a deep friendship after the divorce and A simply didn\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth to accommodate, and when told so L did not respect his wishes. A has no social media and has blocked L on email and phone number for years. \n\nRecently L reached out to me via social media asking me to pass the message to A that she would like him to call her. I told her I\u2019d pass the message along, and I did. My husband did not call her. The next day L messaged me asking why I didn\u2019t pass the message along. I told her that I did, and if A were planning to call that he would on his own time. L reached out to my mother in law with the same request, my mother in law found it odd but she passed the message along as well. My husband still did not call. L reached out to my sister in law and at this point it seems a little over the top.\n\nL messaged me again asking why I didn\u2019t speak up for her with my husband. I\u2019m not gonna lie, it just never occurred to me. It seems to me that this is a \u201cthem\u201d sort of issue, not a \u201cme\u201d sort of issue. I asked my husband why he wouldn\u2019t call and he told me there simply isn\u2019t anything for them to discuss and he doesn\u2019t want his ex wife to believe contacting us will get her what she wants. \n\nThe thing is, he\u2019s a really reasonable guy with solid decision making skills. I trust him and take him at face value. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s being malicious or flippant, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really my place to step in. L has continued on to bad mouth me for not \u201cletting\u201d my husband talk to her. \n\nIt turns out that L is pregnant and the father is not involved. L never reverted to her maiden name after the divorce and wants to give her baby my husband\u2019s last name. I think it\u2019s really decent of her to talk to my husband about this first tbh.

However, she could have divulged the reason to her former MIL.\n\nI agree it\u2019s reasonable of her to want to discuss using his surname but I\u2019d question her motives a little.

Why aren't you standing with your husband in his NC decision?\n\nThe baby name thing is completely irrelevant. I can't believe you fell for that story. The ex is free to name her child whatever she wants. It has absolutely nothing to do with your husband. Her last name may be the same as his because they were once married, but her last name is hers to bestow on her own child.\n\nActually, I'm voting YTA. You were pulled in between your husband and his ex by his ex. You should have immediately STEPPED OUT from between them. Block her. You are an asshole for continuing to be a conduit for unwanted contact.", "NTA she\u2019s gonna put your husbands name in the birth certificate and y\u2019all gonna have lots of issues.", "Even if baby daddy is not involved - offspring could still take his last name.", "And they do it really well because most people refused to believe women can be like that or they think it's not a big deal because women are physically weaker (typically) than men. Women can be just as violent and murderous as men", "She can't come in the front door (your husband), so she's trying the windows (you and your mother-in-law).", "I would like to say N-T-A but honestly, your husband made loud and clear that he doesn't want a relationship with his ex in any way or form but YOU keep pushing and insisting him repeatedly. \n\nYTA for not respecting his boundaries from the beginning because you DID stepped in the conflict.", "Oh- I Agree with you on that too! Scarier yet", "That\u2019s what I was thinking.         \nHe\u2019s going to end up getting contacted by some random kid asking why he wasn\u2019t in the kids life.", "Yes, OP, block her if you haven't already. A man wants to go no contact with his ex, I would at least expect his wife - who has no connection to the ex - to respect his decision and follow suit.\n\nIf I were OP, I would consider your ongoing communication with my ex to be a betrayal. My partner, mother, and sister all lobbying for the person I want absolutely no contact with?", "I was thinking that too or nutty ex saying he had an affair with her and it\u2019s his kid for child support.", "True, I am pregnant atm and harmones obviously have a huge impact in day to day life but they don\u2019t take away your common sense to make decisions. I would never engage with her if I were you again.", "She likely thinks, in her mind, now that she isn't infertile their relationship will work", "\"We're finally having the baby we always dreamed of.\""]}
