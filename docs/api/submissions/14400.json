She took candy from a baby.", "Info:\n\nWhy not ask her why she ate the biggest one and the one with the child\u2019s name on it?\n\nNTA for wondering. \n\nMaybe you should have been specific when telling her to eat one/some of the Easter eggs?\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t actual food an option? Did she just want a snack?", "Look I\u2019m all for sneaking an egg or two at Easter when they\u2019ve been given a bunch .. same at Halloween with chocolate and sweets .. but NEVER in a million years would I even contemplate taking something that was personalised .. that\u2019s really bloody mean \n\nNTA", "WTF? The main issue here has nothing to do with weight. She was unthoughtful and showed very poor etiquette. \n\nIf she tries to turn it into some sort of fat shaming she's obscuring the real issue -simple lack of courtesy. NTA", "Nta. It was a selfish move. People with eating disorders can still be selfish. Based on some of your other comments, it sound like she can act a bit childish around food. Are there other times she\u2019s like that?", "NTA but your GF is. What a selfish thing to do to a kid!", "NTA. It should be common sense not to eat your child's personalized Easter egg wtf...", "Nta but she is", "NTA. An adult should know better than to eat a kid's personalized gift egg. That's like taking a kid's birthday cupcake that has their name on it! Sheesh!", "NTA. I think most people would understand not to eat something with someone else's name on it unless that person is the one who gave them permission to eat it. When you said she could have some of the Easter eggs, she should have understood that you meant the non-personalized, smaller ones. Being upset about that isn't you being rude to her; *she* was rude for eating something with your child's name on it.", "This one sounds almost cartoonish.  NTA.  Sure you didn't specify not to eat the named ones but it's reasonable to expect her to realize those ones are off limits.", "Bahahaha oh my god she chose the one egg they would notice missing. I mean look, I had to keep stealing from my kid\u2019s Easter basket and rehiding eggs during the hunt. I only did this with the small ones of which many look the same, not the damn prize egg with her name on it. Your girlfriend is a bit of a boofhead if she thinks she\u2019s getting away with this. Your kid is absolutely going to notice. She should probably confess and replace it. Too funny.\nNTA", "NTA: she needs to learn some boundaries are not crossed, especially with personalized candy for children. \n\nMay not sound like a huge deal, but to a kid it\u2019s a huge deal.

As she's the children's mother, it does seem particularly selfish to choose the biggest egg that the child had. \n\nFor what it's worth, I'm like a crack addict with milk chocolate and can't have it in the house - just a couple of squares and I'm mentally in the supermarket buying more - so I can understand her having that much daily. I wonder if you'd have more luck approaching it that way instead of as healthy eating?", "*I ate a child's easter egg and my boyfriend told me that was mean how rude of him.*  \n/s  \nNTA She could have easily chosen to eat the smaller ones. Maybe it's cuz of her eating disorders", "NTA. As a mum myself I have been known to eat my daughter's chocolate/sweets any time of the year, but not the big Easter eggs! The key is to steal little and often and they don't know!", "You see her true colors. And your kids surely will. It was a pretty selfish act she pulled. NTA, but your are dating one.", "NTA that shows a worrying lack of empathy towards children and yours in particular. This would ring alarm bells with me.\n\nIf it genuinly had your kids name on it then that is very selfish and possibly worse", "INFO: if you think she has an eating disorder, why would you suggest chocolate? Most people would say there's fruit in the kitchen or cheese and crackers, I could make you a sandwich. Who starts off with candy?", "NTA, if(edited to fix spelling) she claims to misunderstand your logic on this, she's just being manipulative, or she's an adult with a genuine lack of overall intelligence and common sense.", "NTA. I'm seriously curious as to what's going on in her head. Can you ask her for me, pretty please?\n\nEven for someone who's super hungry or has binge eating issues, the worst they'd do is binge on all the small eggs, and *maybe* go after the large egg later if they're an ass or pathologically can't control themselves (like the BORA sandwich guy).\n\nWho tf goes after the largest egg first, when it's clearly a prize or a gift of some significance?\n\nLet her pay to replace that egg, if possible. Or buy something of equal value to compensate that kid.", "Red flag! U don\u2019t fuck around where Easter eggs are concerned, those kids will be scarred\u2026", "NTA bc it had the kids name on it however if you know she suffers with her weight maybe just have delivered \nIt differently\n\nActually nvm I don't think what you said was rude I think she knows she's in the wrong so might take it out of context", "NTA - she should have immediately been like \"nope, not touching that one\" you may want to evaluate your future as this is pretty important trust boundary broken", "ESH So your kids aren't allowed to have food boundaries with your 'girlfriend' who is NOTHING to them and when her entitled greedy ass went for the biggest one; you want that to be all on her even though you explicitly enabled and directed her to steal from them?
