I\u2019m so used to people telling me how irrelevant a BA in humanities is that I\u2019ve just started to accept and believe it myself.\r  \n\r  \nNow on the update:\r  \n\r  \nI accepted my judgement as the AH and went to dinner without my parents. I got a free meal out of it and my aunt was very interested to hear about my future work in my degree\u2019s field. Both her and my grandfather even brought gifts which I had not expected or asked for so all in all, I\u2019m glad I went.\r  \n\r  \nMy aunt apologized for my parent\u2019s absence despite it not being remotely her fault, but it was nice to see someone recognize how hurt I was over it. I\u2019m not currently talking to my parents. Im hoping for an apology but I\u2019m not holding my breath. I\u2019ll likely bring it up on our next meetup though, just to clear the air.

Good on your g-pa and auntie and I'll bet you're glad you didn't bail. Here's a random internet stranger who's very proud of you (who also graduated with what was dubbed a \"BS\" BA degree 35 years ago and never regretted it). My only regret was not to have minored in humanities... Or archeology \ud83d\ude06\u2764\ufe0f", "link to original plz", "Kudos!  Graduation is a huge achievement.  Doing it without parental support or debt is amazing.  \n\nYou rock and I\u2019m proud of you.  Congratulations graduate!", "Congratulations!  I think you did right by your auntie and g-pa!\n\nYa know, us old people can be fun too.  You can have separate relationships with your family. It doesn't always have to be group the old people g together and get dinner over.  \n\nTake care! \ud83e\udd70\nNTA", "I cannot fathom any reason they would have told you they weren\u2019t going after confirming that they were free. What jerks. Congrats on your degree. Your parents do not deserve you."]}
