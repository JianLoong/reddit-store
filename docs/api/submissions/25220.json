I\u2019m so used to people telling me how irrelevant a BA in humanities is that I\u2019ve just started to accept and believe it myself.\r  \n\r  \nNow on the update:\r  \n\r  \nI accepted my judgement as the AH and went to dinner without my parents. I got a free meal out of it and my aunt was very interested to hear about my future work in my degree\u2019s field. Both her and my grandfather even brought gifts which I had not expected or asked for so all in all, I\u2019m glad I went.\r  \n\r  \nMy aunt apologized for my parent\u2019s absence despite it not being remotely her fault, but it was nice to see someone recognize how hurt I was over it. I\u2019m not currently talking to my parents. Im hoping for an apology but I\u2019m not holding my breath. I\u2019ll likely bring it up on our next meetup though, just to clear the air. Thanks again.", "created_utc": 1692669611, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xrk6j/update_wibta_for_cancelling_my_graduation_dinner/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wpm4u/wibta\\_for\\_cancelling\\_my\\_graduation\\_dinner\\_just\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wpm4u/wibta_for_cancelling_my_graduation_dinner_just_a/)", "Congratulations! Good on your g-pa and auntie and I'll bet you're glad you didn't bail. Here's a random internet stranger who's very proud of you (who also graduated with what was dubbed a \"BS\" BA degree 35 years ago and never regretted it). My only regret was not to have minored in humanities... Or archeology \ud83d\ude06\u2764\ufe0f", "link to original plz", "Kudos!  Graduation is a huge achievement.  Doing it without parental support or debt is amazing.  \n\nYou rock and I\u2019m proud of you.  Congratulations graduate!", "Congratulations!  I think you did right by your auntie and g-pa!\n\nYa know, us old people can be fun too.  You can have separate relationships with your family. It doesn't always have to be group the old people g together and get dinner over.  \n\nTake care! \ud83e\udd70\nNTA", "I cannot fathom any reason they would have told you they weren\u2019t going after confirming that they were free. What jerks. Congrats on your degree. Your parents do not deserve you.", "I'm so glad you went and had a great time. \n\nHumanities is an awesome degree and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I have a BA(Hons) and an MA and I don't regret a thing. I loved doing my degrees and I get so much from the skills and knowledge I gained while studying them. I've worked in lots of different fields from IT project management to nursing education. My degrees have been invaluable for all these roles.\n\nHumanities is a subject that teaches you how to critically explore topics, understand nuanced issues, and communicate effectively. It has lots of transferable skills that are essential for a huge range of jobs meaning that unless you have a really specific career plan for your life it is arguably a much better investment than a more specialist career focused degree \n\nI would also argue that, in a world of fake news and misinformation, we would all be better off if more people studied humanities and learnt how to properly analyse and critique their sources.\n\nBe proud of your degree. You have earned it.", "Good decision to go!\nAlso... humanities studies will teach you how to learn things, and how to connect them, and how to look for those connections. These are important skills that will be immensely helpful in any field. Never let someone talk down studies in humanities. The direct knowledge you learn is one thing, the mindset and techniques and ways of thinking are the other, and they are often overlooked, but very valuable.", "NTA.  I have a BA in humanities and then went l  to do a MSC Property valuation and law.  Trust me, all that critical thinking and analysis helped out so much!!  People would try and belittle my BA but I would explain that learning how society and people work is a much better skill than crunching numbers.\n\nNot one regret whatsoever and good luck going forward,  the world truly is your oyster!", "You know you can access it through OPs profile right?", "I know it's easier said than done. But try to focus on the fact that 2 people (your grandfather and aunt) are really proud of you. They recognise your achievements and want to support you.\n\nDon't let your parents downgrade your achievements. And reflect on the fact that you were going to cancel dinner with 2 people who support you, because your parents didn't recognise your worth. It's time to change that and surround yourself with the people that see you and bring the best out of you. Stop chasing people who make you feel bad, before it is a never ending cycle.", "Now that you have graduated and you are \u201cadulting\u201d\u2026 here is some free advice\u2026 Spend your time with and appreciate the people who are good to you. Your aunt, grandfather and your brother are good to you. They are the people to focus your efforts on when you are building relationships.", "I'm glad you got to celebrate with people who care, because anytime you finish a multi-year project (like getting a bachelor's degree), you should mark the occasion.", "I gotta ask: what is your parents' deal?? Have they always been this douchey? \n\nCongrats on your degree and on a great dinner!", "Did they ever say why they canceled after saying they were free?"]}
