You might have been a bit harsh in your conversation, but you obviously didn\u2019t lie.

Congratulations!  \n\n\nSecond off, Sorry to hear your father ruined the moment.  \n\n\nNTA for obvious reasons. Your father was there for both you and your partner regardless of his opinion of your sexuality.

My mom has a delicate, feminine wedding set because that's her style.  Her wife has a thicker, more masculine band because she fell in love with it the moment she saw it.  My own wedding ring was considered masculine because I've got the sturdy sort of hands that compliment the style, and my ex-husband was thrilled that we had exactly matching bands.

It\u2019s okay to like it, but honestly why do you think he did?\n\nClearly he sees himself as having the masculine energy in the relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s normal for a heterosexual man to look for male/female roles in a gay relationship - especially someone your dads age.  Maybe talk through how it really is instead of just being angry.\n\nYour dad shouldn\u2019t carry on if you\u2019ve asked him to stop \u2026 but what he\u2019s saying is true from a certain perspective.\n\nNAH", "ESH.

Too bad, homophobe dad.", "He got it because he knew he'd like it.

Such discussions are appropriate during dating and, if an object of contention, couple's therapy.\n\nOP would know this through the dating/courting process, and we, internet strangers, will not know better than OP. Your input is ignorant and insulting to the OP's intelligence. OP has made their stance on the matter very clear to their dad, to the point of uninviting him to the wedding. The readers can make an assumption that your concern is moot.", "Ew.", "Why did he buy his fianc\u00e9 a ring the fianc\u00e9 likes? Is that a serious question?", "Look!

We assign them genders as a society, which is wrong. Women can wear men\u2019s clothing and nobody bats an eye. Why is it such an issue for a man to wear what we as a society have deemed \u201cfeminine?\u201d \n\nAlso, the man does not have to propose. That is an old tradition that is very slowly declining over time. \n\nGet with the times.", "I met a woman (new job) last week who had recently gotten engaged. She had a massive rock and I personally didn't like the style of the ring, although it was obviously very expensive and valuable. But it wasn't bought for me. It was bought for her, and it was obvious she loved it and suited *her* aesthetic really well. My aesthetic preferences were obviously irrelevant so no need to bring it up.", "Hell, that even extends to partners. My mom got remarried, and frankly I think the guy\u2019s pathetic - we have very different opinions on a lot of things and I don\u2019t care for him. But he treats my mom well and makes her happy, so that\u2019s all that matters. If he was doing something inappropriate or violent that would be completely different, but it\u2019s just clashing personalities. I\u2019ve never told my mom and never will because it doesn\u2019t matter what I think of him"]}
