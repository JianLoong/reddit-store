I don\u2019t remember her saying one bad thing about my daughter before this.\n\nMy mom tried to calm my sister down but her face was red which was a big tell about how mad she was, she scolded me for bragging about my daughter accomplishments when I know how her daughter was just kicked out (her words) from AP math for a few too many bad grades.\n\nI didn\u2019t know about it, she never told me but she obviously told my mom since she was on her side.\n\nI apologised because I wanted to keep the peace but I guess it was obvious that I was still confused because she just kept scolding me.\n\nAfter a minute of sitting there my husband just excused us and we left.\n\nI\u2019ve been getting texts from relatives berating me for insulting my niece like that.\n\nI\u2019m so confused but no one listen when I try to say that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m starting to really feel bad and I think I should apologise again and talk to my sister but I need to know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1704172704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18whgke/aita_for_bragging_about_my_daughter/", "score": 2206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the same time, I understand that you\u2019re proud of your daughter, but you need to stop bragging about her all the time. It\u2019s obviously become excessive which is why your family is lashing out. She\u2019s more than just her accomplishments and you\u2019re more than just her parent. What have you been up to lately? Whatever it is, why don\u2019t you talk about that? \n\nI grew up with people whose parents did what you\u2019re doing and by the time they got halfway through undergrad, they shut down and resented their parents for making academics their entire personality. Because of their parents\u2019 constant bragging, they didn\u2019t feel they could choose a different path without disappointing their parents. \n\nI go through this in my own family. My dad is always bragging about what my sister and I are doing and it\u2019s annoying. When I got into law school, he immediately started calling relative after relative instead of letting me savor that moment alone with my immediate family. Don\u2019t risk doing this to your daughter.

You say your sister has always been your daughter\u2019s biggest supporter. Have you been the same for her daughter? Your child is clearly excelling, which is wonderful. But her excelling will always grab attention and is in the end rewarding all on its own. Your sister is concerned for her child, and you need to be aware / sensitive to the fact that excelling in school does not determine worthiness of appreciation or care. If you are all family gathered to enjoy each other\u2019s company, no child should get the lions share of focus, for good or bad. You do not maintain strong family bonds with your behavior.

Save the extra bragging for when it's just the grandparents, not other parents whose kids aren't at the same level of accomplishments.\n\nESH is my formal vote because your sister crossed the line by falsely telling other relatives that you were actually insulting her daughter.\n\nI have super smart kids as well.  It's really nice to have a friend group of parents of other smart kiddos so we can share accomplishments without it being viewed as overly bragging.  And they understand the unique struggles as well and don't misinterpret it as bragging when you're genuinely venting about how difficult it is to jump through all the hips for dual enrollment so your kid can take math at the college since they've run out of coursework at the high school.\n\nI'd suggest trying to find other families to connect with so you have a similar community.", "YTA. \n\n>I talk about it ALOT\n\nI mean you wrote that \"a lot\" in big letters.

Was your niece also at that table when you went on about how great your daughter is in school? That would have made it worse.

Most parents only share the odd things here and there when it's really big. I have to ask, is that the only way your daughter is ever talked about? It sounds like her whole identity to you is wrapped up in academic success? Is that the only thing she ever gets talked about? Her grades don't define her. It's not who she is as a whole person or is she only ever the smart kid?", "Gentle YTA. Talk about something else", "YTA read the room, you must have known your niece isn't as academically gifted.

You can't be sensitive to what's going on in her life if you don't know.\n\nHowever, you might be being an asshole towards your daughter.

Is it possible she works so hard because her grades and other academic achievements are the main (or overwhelming) way she gets validation from you ?\n\nHard work is great, but she's still a kid. Make sure she isn't burning herself out chasing your approval.", "YTA if you keep talking about your daughter\u2019s grades. Even in this post, you gotta listed out all her achievements when you could have just said she is smart, and a high achiever then go straight into the math thing.\n\n At some point, it must be tiring for your relatives to hear all that\u2026 and I\u2019m sure you know your niece is not as strong academically because no one flunks math out of the blue\u2026 so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s been a long time coming with your sister listening to you brag (oh ya you bragging) esp if the girls are close in age\u2026 \n\nMaybe try to curb it in future and just talk about milestones, ie awards.. your whole neighbourhood already knows she has good grades.

From this post it's obvious that you never shut up about your kid, which it's great you're proud, but I can tell you right now, if your sister snapped, she would have been dropping clear body language well before this indicating she wishes you would be quite. \nAlso can we just think for a second about what all this attention to success is doing to your kid mentally? It's really not good to focus solely on those things.", "You didn\u2019t necessarily insult your niece directly but in this post you are bragging about your daughter and you acknowledge this is something you do regularly. How often are you listening about other people\u2019s lives and children as opposed to being boastful about your daughter? It sounds like this is an issue that others have noticed, where you don\u2019t seem to want to discuss much else. I meet parents like this sometimes, where they confuse their children\u2019s accomplishments as their own and it comes off as extremely self-centered to discuss and boast about it so much. \n\nI\u2019m sure your daughter is great, but your niece probably is too, and you\u2019re not doing your daughter any favors by potentially being alienating on her behalf with this behavior. You\u2019re also taking away her chance to discuss her own life. Maybe she wants to share her accomplishments herself (or not share them) and since it\u2019s your main topic, she doesn\u2019t have that opportunity. As a general rule, we should all try to listen as much as we speak, and bragging is best done with extreme moderation. Your sister may have overreacted, but her statement suggests that her daughter\u2019s recent struggles caused such a strong reaction to an ongoing frustration with this topic from you. Maybe share what *you\u2019re* doing, mention your daughter is doing well and you\u2019re proud, and then move on. The boasting will be better received when it\u2019s not the centerpiece of most conversations. YTA and your sister slightly sucks for not bringing it up sooner.", "It\u2019s possible to be proud and not brag, true story!", "ESH You shouldnt be constantly bragging about your daughter, its distasteful and boorish behavior.

Daughter graduated with 4.0 from undergrad, full ride to a top 20 law school and a federal clerkship.

Honestly, I'm stuck between ESH and NTA. I come from a Chinese family where bragging about your kid's accomplishments is the norm. It's expected, in fact. It can be very toxic though, but it was my culture's way of encouraging our kids to do better. In hyper-competitive job markets, if you aren't the best or don't have connections, you'll end up unemployed or working min wage in the service industry. \n\nMy parents always bragged about their co-workers kids or my cousins, and then asked why I couldn't be just like them and get into med school or earn a $100k salary right out of school. \n\nYou didn't know your niece was struggling in school.

That said While You are the A But a very gentle one.  The fact that so many of them jumped on you tells me you talk about your daughters a lot.  You know in old tv shows and cartoons, that stereotypical parent with 100 photos of their kid that they can\u2019t wait to shove in your face and show you no matter what context. That\u2019s you.   No one likes that character.  I know your proud of your child it\u2019s a good thing.

They know you like to share your daughter's achievements with your family, so why did no one let you know that this time it would be a sensitive subject?", "YTA. Listen, I have two kids. My youngest is Autistic and has mild cognitive impairment. His IQ is 77. He\u2019s also one of the two best people I know, sweet, kind, friendly, loving and hard working. My older one is smart as hell but has adhd and is prone to anxiety and depression. She damn near failed out of high school, till she pulled it together senior year. The summer before senior year she sated volunteering at a summer camp for autistic teens. Not because she needed NHS volunteer hours or for college applications, but because she wanted to do something for others. That lead to working in the clinic as a peer mentor and eventually inspired her to work with our state Special Olympics to create, pilot, coach and run our state\u2019s first and only SO team in her sport. She works with 9 athletes with various physical and intellectual disabilities and she adores them. She\u2019s the other best person I know. \n\nSo respectfully, I would say two things about my own parenting experience:\n1. Not all kids are capable of academic achievement, not because they aren\u2019t hard workers but because nature hasn\u2019t given them those gifts. It can be incredibly painful for parents and children struggling to hear a bunch of  bragging from someone who is super oblivious. \n2. Academic achievement is meaningless in terms of your success as a parent or your child\u2019s success as a human. Brag about her curiosity, her hard work ethic, her thirst for wisdom, her involvement in her community- the parts of her personality that you take justifiable pride in, be proud of HER rather than of her work. That will make you a much better, and more tolerable, mom.", "YTA- no one cares", "At first I was ready with YTA if it was your daughter being embarrassed about it, but how on earth were you supposed to *know* that your niece wasn\u2019t doing too well academically?

I\u2019ve gotten to the point where if the kids want to share, its their accomplishment to share, not mine. I didn\u2019t study extra, I didn\u2019t practice more for the 1st place in sports. Sometimes just mentioning it to other people makes them feel bad about their kids or make the kids themselves feel bad. I don\u2019t share unless someone asks. It\u2019s a slippery slope. I got my cousin in a bad mood because they kept saying my daughter is so tall and she was standing next to him and I was genuinely shocked, but proclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re right, she is like an inch taller than you!\u201d We haven\u2019t seen this family in 2 years, so the height thing surprised us.

No one liked being compared to me, no one liked to hear my dad or granny talking all the time about my grades. Including me. No one in class wanted to hear from the teacher I scored the highest again or I \"broke the curve\" for grading. Hearing brags about me was pure cringe. My mama saved me. Being from a culture that thinks bragging is unpleasant vanity, she shut my dad down.

Maybe \"really well, I'm very proud of how hard she works on her academics\" and without bragging about test scores, etc.\n\nOnce your sister calms down, let her know you weren't aware her daughter was struggling and are sorry you invited difficult comparisons with your bragging.

So you are not an AH for talking about it, However... sometimes if you do something constantly/continously it can become very annoying, such as if a specific topic keeps coming back around no matter the circumstances or current conversation, then that is too much. If every (or super often that it seems constant)casual conversation with others leads to your daughter then that is too much.\nThink back on your normal interactions with your friends and family, did you bring up your daughter a lot?\nNow, the sister needs to chill TF out, if she did not tell you that her daughter got kicked out then it's not on you, and your mom is dumb af for not listening to your side and I'm curious if there's favoritism there due to her standing with the sister automatically instead of trying to understand the situation as a parent would/should.\nYour family also needs to chill tf out as well, I would respond to them simply that \"I was talking about only my daughter and did not know about my niece's situation at the time, it was a sensitive subject I was not aware of\". That's it, if they continue then at that point they are being antagonistic on purpose and you need to block them.\nLast thing, if you've thought back and you do talk about your daughter constantly, watch what you say from then on, think before you speak. It does not matter how badly you want to keep that conversation for everything you want to say, have some self control because it is annoying and not going to portray the feelings you want to give out no matter how badass she is, I promise.\nIf you thought back and you don't talk about your daughter constantly but bring her up now and then, then you need to have a talk with your family and see what their issue is, because if that's it then that's messed up because you should be able to talk about your kids. If they don't like it then I would strongly suggest low contact, because that's again very stupid and not healthy for any of you.\n\nEDIT: I just realized your post said \"I talk about it A LOT.

Why telling us all the electives etc she is taking, specificizing exactly which ones, where all you had to say was \"My daughter is doing extremely well at school and I am extremely proud of that\". I can understand why the family is fed up with hearing about your superduper daughter all the time, especially if your sister's child is doing less well. They kept their silence to keep the peace, but the bucket spilled over. Try another subject to talk about (your sister's child perhaps for a change, for apparently you had no idea how she was doing).
