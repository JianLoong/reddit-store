I\u2019ve known him for a very long time, since I was 14, and I\u2019m 34 now. His parents are technically his father and step mother, as his mom passed away when he was 15. I do think he holds a lot of resentment against his father for remarrying. But they\u2019ve been married now for 25 years, and they are truly soulmates. From my own experience being with him and what he\u2019d convey to me, most of his issues with them stemmed from materialistic issues, like thinking they did more for the other grandkids, or helped the other siblings out more financially. He never expressed to me anything emotional driven. I never noticed them helping others more or not because those things are not priorities to me, to be truthful. His step mother has even kept some jewelry of his mothers to pass onto our girls when they are older. I think he wanted it himself, but he has a past of pawning things, etc so\u2026 I can understand his frustration there but they did give him so much of his mothers. He has used our children as pawns before with me, so it\u2019s easier for me to see the correlation in his actions. When covid happened, he had the kids when the courts closed down for 9 months and for 9 months he kept them from me because he knew there was nothing I could do legally until the courts opened back up. It was pretty traumatizing. I try to let those kinds of things go, because it serves no purpose today. I knew him very well, and I know what he\u2019s capable of. I just want our kids to have the opportunity to have a relationship with their grandparents. They supported him throughout our divorce and showed up to court on his side and I would have too for my kids. And then suddenly it was like they didn\u2019t exist.", "NTA your ex is estranged from his parents, not your kids. We had a similar situation in our family and I was the person who brought my young relatives to their grandparents until the adults could act like they were adults. I can see a little of your exs POV but your ex inlaws didn't do anything heinous. Your ex can make the decision not to bring the kids over but when you have the kids with you it's your decision.", "NTA I was in a similar situation with my brother. My sil let me see my nieces when he wasn\u2019t allowed to see them. That was his issue, not mine. He doesn\u2019t get to dictate relationships outside of his own.", "NTA. It's your time with the kids, they have a positive relationship with their grandparents and vice versa, and he chose to cut his parents off for a very petty reason. The only thing being hurt is your ex's pride, and I'm guessing his insistence on holding a grudge is part of why he's your ex.", "NTA. Unless he can give you specific examples of his parents being abusive or reasons for them to be unsafe in their presence, you\u2019re doing the right thing. Your husband sounds jealous and should let that go. Why wouldn\u2019t any reasonable person want their children to have more loving people in their lives?", "INFO - Why is he estranged? What are his reasons? They could very well be abusive. Such parents are really good at wearing a mask for others while abusing a targeted child in private.", "NTA barring legitimate concerns about their safety, your ex-husband doesn't get to make his issues with his parents a barrier preventing the kids from having a relationship with them, nor does he get any say about what happens during your custodial time. If he's upset, it's of his own making, and unless he can provide a reasonable argument for keeping the kids NC with grandma and grandpa, his emotional response is of no consequence.", "NTA. If there was a safety concern, or there was abuse or overt favouritism, something that would hurt your kids emotionally or physically? Then I'd say you were the AH. But there doesn't seem to be.\n\nWhat there seems to be is an ex that I am not surprised is an ex, and a family that wants to love your kids, a family that your kids would benefit from knowing. I'm guessing that your kids weren't getting presents, but his siblings kids did, and that triggered him. But things were hard for a lot of people.\n\nYour ex is using your children as a weapon against his parents. He's not mad they're seeing them, he's mad he can't use them to hurt his parents.", " NTA  Ex is a selfish asshole.", "I'm torn with my verdict. I feel this is one of those Reddit posts that will call the OP N-T-A because she was a woman. If the tables were turned and OP was a man, the comments would be way different. Y-T-A all day for him and down votes for anyone who disagreed.  How dare he take the kids against their moms(known) wishes! \n\nNAH.", "I think he is right that if he is estranged from them that it's his role to bring them more into their lives. I know that coparenting is done as a team. But I think if you made a decision to not contact your parents, even if it was \"petty\", and he ignored your wishes that you would be upset at him and rightfully so.", "There's no way for us to know whether your ex husband's parents were \"good parents\" or not or whether they are \"good people\". You say the estrangement was over \"petty reasons\" but you are hearing that from the aunt who is obviously going to have her own biased perspective. Adults don't usually estrange themselves from their parents without a good reason. (maybe they do sometimes but that's VERY unusual) There's probably more to the estrangement than you think there is.\n\nYou and your husband are divorced, and he can't tell you who you or your kids can or can't have a relationship with. The grandkids do have a right to see their grandparents if they want to and if there are no obvious signs that them being around their grandparents is harmful.\n\nYou're NTA for letting your kids see their grandparents, but implying that your ex husband is petty and that his pain isn't valid and he doesn't have \"a good reason\" for going NC with them himself is pretty insensitive and presumptuous.\n\nEdit: Have you tried asking your husband his perspective on the estrangement? You seem pretty deadset on believing that his parents are good people and that he is being \"petty\". Try asking him why he went NC with them if you want a more balanced perspective.", "NTA, but keep that same energy if you are ever put in a similar situation on the receiving end. Why would you now open up a can of worms when you should be doing your best to Co-parent with your ex? You should have at least communicated with him beforehand as you made the children do your job after they saw his parents. You knew it would cause issues and you did not care one bit. You and your ex-husband better figure things out cordially before it negatively impacts your children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wonder if he got less so his siblings could get more or some kind of favortism. If you have toxic parents that play favorites, it is generally recommended you cut them out if they display that treatment towards the children, so you should talk to your ex about his childhood and stuff.  \n\n\nAbusers tend to start small and work their way up. Tread carefully, depending on local laws and court stuff, if your husband can prove past abuse and patterns of abuse, he might be able to go for full custody.  \n\n\nESH", "NTA but judging by the COVID instance and his petty grudges and his pawning stuff off\u2026..  I think maybe you should be seeking primary custody. Is he stable mentally?", "Alright he does sound like a pretty big AH. Keeping your kids from you was vindictive and cruel. There's no other way to look at that. \n\nHe can be NC with his parents for whatever reason, but you are divorced and he can't dictate what relationships your kids have with them when they are in your custody. (obviously) This does sound like a rare case of an adult going NC with their parents for childish reasons.", "My sister has some mental health issues along with health problems that make her very difficult to deal with. She created an incident and then held a grudge against our parents refusing to speak to them and kept her kids from them. When they were old enough to visit by themselves they re-started the relationship. Sadly for my youngest niece she only got a year or two before my mother passed and she was angry with her mother for stealing that time from her because of her own made up grudges. Unless you think he can do something to you in court, don't deny them their grandparents.", "A problem with pawning things, does he have a known history of bringing debt on himself that he needs a cash flow to deal with? You also say he\u2019s used the kids to act against you, has he taken their stuff? That might be why he was so upset about the lack of presents one year.", "Does he blame his dad for just moving on or did dad cheat on mom with stepmom? I'm also confused, his mom died and then dad remarried? If he's 34, then it hasn't been 25 years since his mom died and dad remarried...\n\nWow, your ex is an absolute AH. Was he successful in his parental alienation plot? Are the kids distant with you? Why would you have any positive relationships with your ex in laws when they supported him in keeping the children away from you? They deserve no sympathy from you. They wronged you for supporting your ex. NTA but y t a to yourself, you're way too forgiving and naive. If given the chance and your ex tries to screw you over again, you bet his parents would support him and forget your kindness.", "It\u2019s in the post - the grandparents were short on $ and couldn\u2019t buy birthday presents for the grandkids (sounds like all of them), and the ex went nuclear.", "Yeah but then OP would be the asshole for being upset. If his children needed to be protected from the parents that would be one thing, but that's not the case here", "His wish was that the kids and grandparents not see each other?", "Wow I never even thought of that, but woah that actually makes sense \ud83d\ude33. I know he\u2019s in a lot of debt. He bought the kids switches one year for Christmas and then took them away as punishment and resold them very quickly, I thought that was odd. I\u2019ve brought up that our oldest really needs braces and asked if we could split a payment plan on them for her, which at most would be $200 a month split half way, $100 a month for him and he refuses. Thats honestly very likely, thank you for bringing that to my attention.", "I\u2019m 34, but my ex is 41. There\u2019s a lot to that as well because my ex actually groomed me from age 14\u2026 it\u2019s a very long story. There\u2019s a lot of history there. I know it seems I am naive and may be too nice. I use to harbor a lot of anger against my ex for the things he has done to me. As I\u2019ve gotten older, that anger does not serve me well. It does nothing but make my life harder, and I\u2019ve really tried to live more peacefully. I\u2019m remarried myself to an absolute golden retriever of a person and I\u2019ve healed a lot of wounds in me to grow as a person with all of this. My kids are not distant with me, we are very close. My ex husband definitely tried to create distance between us but he was not successful in it. My kids feel like they can breath when they are with me, I know they walk on eggshells a lot with their dad. I just try to be a positive influence for them and guide them the best I can on my time.", "Yeah that was what the aunt said, I wanted to know what he said.", "In fairness, that was the explanation provided by someone who didn't make the decision to distance himself from the situation. It could be exactly what happened, it could be part of it, or it could be entirely wrong/false.", "He honestly never gave me a reason. We were married for 7 years and I\u2019ve know him for 20 years personally. I do know his parents were never abusive. They sometimes didn\u2019t help him financially as an adult after they\u2019d helped him countless times before, I know that really upset him. But his parents helped him a lot. Even spent like 4 grand furnishing a room for the kids in his house after we divorced. He\u2019s never mentioned any abuse during the 20 years I\u2019ve known him. As an adult he had to get top dentures and his dad paid for it. I sincerely have no clue why he\u2019d cut them out, because I am not aware of anything serious"]}
