I am pretty reserved and quiet so I don't go out much and a lot of times Alex takes me out on hangouts with his friends where I always stay pretty quiet. He has reassured me that this is okay with him.\n\n  \nA few months ago one of his friends, Luis(26m), began to make small talk with me. It was nothing big, asked about my major (eng lit), and from there he would just chat with me sometimes. Ask about my classes mainly. He didn't seem to mind that I kept my answers pretty short and instead would go on to talk about his day, his classes, his cat, etc. I have always been more of a listener so I don't mind.\n\n  \nFast forward to last week and on Friday, I had gone out with Alex and his friends and Luis came up to me because he had seen \u201cThe Green Knight\u201d and he wanted to let me know that he didn't like it since I had mentioned before that it was one of my favorite stories. Medieval lit is a topic that I really enjoy though I know it\u2019s not something that is of interest to a lot of people. Which, I guess is what contributed to my eagerness to discuss it with Luis since he did seem interested in the convo. On the way home my bf was pretty quiet but beyond asking whether he was okay and him saying yes I left him be.\n\nOn Saturday he came over to my house to have dinner and was clearly still upset. During the whole thing, he was irritable which also began to irritate me since he wouldn't say if something was wrong. So, I admit that I got tired and told him to say if he was upset.

Apparently, he thinks that because I was \u201cgrinning from ear to ear\u201d as he put it, that meant that I was flirting with his friend. He basically told me that being that chatty with another guy was inappropriate and that I was disrespecting clear relationship boundaries.\n\nHe had never shown discomfort with me talking to his friend before so I asked for clarification about that and he said that he didn't mind before because I had, \u201ckept Luis at arm's length.\u201d I then went on to call him ridiculous and a hypocrite since he is very close with many of his girl friends and I have never made a fuss about it or thought that he was flirting with them. He went on to tell me that that was different and that he was not that type of guy so there was no reason for me to think that to begin with. Now, THIS genuinely made me angry since that means that he thinks that I AM that type of person. After he said this I told him to get tf out of my house. That was on Saturday and he has been sending me angry texts and trying to call. I have been ignoring him and I don't feel bad about it.\n\nI don't think that I'm being irrational but I told what happened to a friend of mine and she thinks I'm being an ah.

Guy#2 who had also become friendly with her (100% platonic) and defended her and Guy#1 took great offense to it and acted kinda like how Alex is acting.
