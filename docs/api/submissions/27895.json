I am pretty reserved and quiet so I don't go out much and a lot of times Alex takes me out on hangouts with his friends where I always stay pretty quiet. He has reassured me that this is okay with him.\n\n  \nA few months ago one of his friends, Luis(26m), began to make small talk with me. It was nothing big, asked about my major (eng lit), and from there he would just chat with me sometimes. Ask about my classes mainly. He didn't seem to mind that I kept my answers pretty short and instead would go on to talk about his day, his classes, his cat, etc. I have always been more of a listener so I don't mind.\n\n  \nFast forward to last week and on Friday, I had gone out with Alex and his friends and Luis came up to me because he had seen \u201cThe Green Knight\u201d and he wanted to let me know that he didn't like it since I had mentioned before that it was one of my favorite stories. Medieval lit is a topic that I really enjoy though I know it\u2019s not something that is of interest to a lot of people. Which, I guess is what contributed to my eagerness to discuss it with Luis since he did seem interested in the convo. On the way home my bf was pretty quiet but beyond asking whether he was okay and him saying yes I left him be.\n\nOn Saturday he came over to my house to have dinner and was clearly still upset. During the whole thing, he was irritable which also began to irritate me since he wouldn't say if something was wrong. So, I admit that I got tired and told him to say if he was upset. He seemed to get more annoyed at me for that and basically told me that he was upset that I had been flirting with Luis the previous night. Apparently, he thinks that because I was \u201cgrinning from ear to ear\u201d as he put it, that meant that I was flirting with his friend. He basically told me that being that chatty with another guy was inappropriate and that I was disrespecting clear relationship boundaries.\n\nHe had never shown discomfort with me talking to his friend before so I asked for clarification about that and he said that he didn't mind before because I had, \u201ckept Luis at arm's length.\u201d I then went on to call him ridiculous and a hypocrite since he is very close with many of his girl friends and I have never made a fuss about it or thought that he was flirting with them. He went on to tell me that that was different and that he was not that type of guy so there was no reason for me to think that to begin with. Now, THIS genuinely made me angry since that means that he thinks that I AM that type of person. After he said this I told him to get tf out of my house. That was on Saturday and he has been sending me angry texts and trying to call. I have been ignoring him and I don't feel bad about it.\n\nI don't think that I'm being irrational but I told what happened to a friend of mine and she thinks I'm being an ah. She says that he isn't completely wrong and that I am childish for ignoring him.  \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1696012093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vjbci/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriend_ridiculous/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That doesn't mean you're flirting with Luis, that just means you're appreciating a conversation with someone. \n\nThe double standard your bf is setting is very insulting. In my personal opinion, your friend is wrong, you were not being an ass or childish. The person who should apologize is your bf. I'm sorry, maybe I'm wrong but if he's acting this way, I don't think this relationship is very healthy.", "NTA, he is using double standards and insulting you in the process. He only deserves a response if he apologises profusely for his accusations.", "NTA. You did nothing inappropriate and he is treating you like a possession.", "NTA\n\nYou have chosen a very controlling bf for yourself. You may want to try and find a better one. Maybe Luis is available. When someone you have a relationship with has rules that only apply to you and not them, that's a recipe for disaster.", "NTA. What an awesome Luis is who is going out of his way to make sure you (his friends partner) feels happy and included.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is jealous and treating you like he has exclusive rights to have conversation with you.", "NTA, I'm sorry your relationship is over.  I say this because you are right, he was implying that you are that type of person.  You don't deserve that kind of disrespect.  This is not a relationship boundary, this is controlling behavior and he just waved a red flag in your face.", "Yup, that's exactly what he implied: he thinks you're \"that kind of person\". I'm typically very understanding of people's insecurities, but your bf really screwed up on this one. NTA.", "NTA, he is wildly possessive and thinks applying a double standard is fine.", "NTA.  No double standards allowed.  Dump this guy.", "NTA- well he thinks you are going to cheat on him. Obviously doesnt trust his friend either.", "NTA - nothing wrong with holding a conversation with another person. Your bf wants to put you in an ivory tower all by yourself and that makes him the AH. My question would be \"why doesn't he want you to make friends with his friends?\" Would that make every hang out more enjoyable for everyone? He's clearly insecure and may have a history of flirting with other girls behind your back which is why he's so attune to the behavior now. Good luck dealing with this", "NTA \n\nDump this boyfriend and this friend. Your boyfriend is projecting here plus extremely insecure when accusing you of flirting. What\u2019s next? Accusing you of cheating if you shake Luis\u2019 hand?", "NTA. He\u2019s fine with you trailing along with his friends as long as you don\u2019t begin to actually enjoy it? Because all the matters is what he gets out of the evening? F*** that. You can do better.", "NTA - You did nothing wrong and neither did Luis. I would continue to ignore the hopefully now ex boyfriend. You should never give a jealous and controlling person a chance. If he can't trust you and thinks that it's in any way acceptable to decide who you can and can't talk to, the faster you get away the better it will be for you in the long run.", "Nta. He's probably so used to you being quiet he's forgotten that you're capable of having conversations with other people. He also sounds super possessive and insecure if having a conversation about a movie makes him worried that you're going to cheat.", "NTA.\n\nAs everyone is pointing out, he's being jealous and possessive. The double standard he's holding you to is irrational and you said it yourself, he seems to think that YOU'RE that type of person. Or he thinks Luis is the type of person to hit on someone in a relationship and doesn't trust you enough to turn down his advances were he to make any. Regardless, Alex is in the wrong here.\n\nThis kinda reminds me of something that happened with a couple old friends of mine, way back in the day... Basically, Guy#1 was complaining about his girlfriend, I don't remember why he was complaining but it was not a big deal but something he deemed a character flaw, like preferring to read a book over watching a movie or something. Guy#2 who had also become friendly with her (100% platonic) and defended her and Guy#1 took great offense to it and acted kinda like how Alex is acting. Like all of a sudden, Guy#2 was a threat despite him never showing romantic interest, he just defended her as a friend. Wondering if Alex and Luis had a similar exchange behind closed doors...", "NTA fuck that loser", "You can talk to people without him feeling some kind of way about it for grief's sake. He is your BF, not your owner. (I am impatient with jealousy at the best of times, frankly.) He decides who you get to discuss something you greatly enjoy with?\n\nUh un. That's a lot to ask anyone to respect. NTA. \"Luis, I love you. But, I'm not like a pair of shoes you own. I have agency and your boundaries are just control issues to me. No point in trying to gaslight me by pretending I did anything wrong. I'm not up for that kind of relationship with you.\"\n\nYou get to be yourself in social settings without being judged as disrespecting his insecurities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Plus, why is he even taking you around his friends if he doesn't want you to socialize with them? Did he expect you to be in complete silence each time? Weirdo. \n\nBut I do think you should stop ignoring him and have a conversation with him about this in person.
