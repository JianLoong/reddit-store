The weddings that serve both veg and non-veg food have a completely different set up in two different sheds. So Stacey acting stringent is not unheard of, however the fact that she only became a vegan now means she has had meat before and obviously knows how the cooking happens. So starting an argument and not backing down was atrocious, especially since OP was managing all by herself.
