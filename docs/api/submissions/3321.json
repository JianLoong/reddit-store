For the life of me I can't see where I complained about anybody outside of questioning the behaviour of OP's sister tantrumming over a potential drop of gravy - the purpose of this sub.   Perhaps adding a smiley to reflect the tone of the 1st line  would have prevented your offense? There are many who know the difference between veganism & vegetarianism & those who don't - or who respond quickly & miswrite! There was no insult intended in defining the difference & I'm sorry you were offended as you read my response to the commenter. Sorry as well if u/Rivka333 was offended - sending that smiley your way & an apology just in case my response was offensive to you Rivka :-). \n\nYou're right that most vegans who choose veganism for ethical or general health reasons are accepting of & unaffected by minimal cross contamination. I have had clients however, that I've had to meet in the ER over a higher degree of cross contamination for whom indigestion was not the effect, but the potential loss of the children they carried. There can be serious repercussions for some who have either abstained from meat proteins for long periods or have other conditions that are affected by their consumption. I thought OP mentioned the sister's 'under a year' veganism to highlight the improbability of meat protein intolerance from abstension. I hope you're not offended by me providing this information.\n\nHowever, I'll keep in mind your advice to \"please don't use any and every opportunity just to complain about people who you don't even know\", as well as the application of that advice by those providing it. :-)", "besides the fact that most figs in supermarkets nowadays are self pollinating and therefore don't contain wasps, the whole reason that some figs have wasps in them is because the fig and wasp are in a symbiotic relationship! The fig helps the wasp with reproduction and the wasp fertilizes the fig. Both parties (including the wasp) profit from it! Ergo, figs are vegan (at least to the people who understand what veganism is actually about)\n\nas for honey: while it is an animal product, imo it can be vegan. The argument a lot of vegans make against honey is that the bees don't want to stay in the beekeeper's hive and only do so because the beekepers cut off the queen's wings or trap her in the hive. While this may be the case for some beekeepers, it certainly doesn't apply to all of them.

It quickly became routine for me to advise long term vegan & vegetarian clients about potential cross contamination.

That kind of behaviour from an adult is never okay.\n\nI meant I don\u2019t think you are rude if you politely ask your non-vegan family or friends upfront if they are able to accommodate your vegan diet when they invite you. Or if they prefer you bring your own vegan dish. How would you know if you cannot ask or talk about it?\n\nI\u2019m European, not American, so I\u2019ve never celebrated Thanksgiving. I assume Thanksgiving is about spending time together while eating, like a festive Christmas dinner but with traditional American food like stuffed turkey. At my in-laws we cook multiple courses at Christmas. Some of us are vegetarian, one doesn\u2019t eat cheese, one eats meat but only low fat with lots of protein like chicken. We just try to find dishes everyone likes and communicate about it, so all expectations are clear and there\u2019s no surprises on Christmas Day. It\u2019s all cooked in the same small kitchen (but all food preferences are based on personal choices, not medical reasons like allergies or intolerance).\n\nAt my family my mother made it clear she will not accommodate me and my boyfriend\u2019s vegetarian diet, so at Christmas I will bring our own food and reheat or prepare it at their kitchen. I don\u2019t mind (except the part where they ridicule me for my food choices while I never say anything about their choices and preferences, so I try to avoid eating with my family whenever possible).\n\nAnd when I was invited for a work related festive dinner I did ask if there were vegetarian dishes available because the restaurant they chose is known for it\u2019s meat dishes. Luckily they had some good options, otherwise I would\u2019ve declined the invitation as I don\u2019t particularly enjoy dining without eating.\n\nI don\u2019t expect people to accommodate my vegetarian diet, but I do appreciate it if they do and I will definitely not throw a tantrum if they don\u2019t do it perfectly. If they think I\u2019m rude for asking upfront if they will or will not be able to accommodate my vegetarian diet by including vegetarian dishes then it\u2019s probably better to do other activities together than eating. Because if I\u2019m invited to a lunch or dinner, I need to ask because I like to be able to actually eat something at a lunch or dinner and I don\u2019t carry around food for just in case I need it.
