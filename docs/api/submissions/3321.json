Among the guests was my sister, Stacey (29F), who has recently become vegan. Like, within the past year.\n\nSo when we were planning our meal, she asked if we could make sure there were vegan options available. I said of course. I even asked one of my vegan friends for a recipe recommendation and practiced it because I don\u2019t mind having something meatless in my repertoire.\n\nFast forward to the day, when I\u2019m making the gravy at the same time as the veggies I\u2019m sauteeing for my sister. She came over and saw what I was doing and freaked out on me. She said I could have contaminated her meal with turkey drippings. I get the vegan thing is important to her, but I thought she was overreacting a bit. \n\nI said I\u2019m sorry, but I have a lot to do and I\u2019m being careful not to cross contaminate. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re allergic.\n\nShe flipped out at that and I admit, I lost my cool after going back and forth for a bit. She just would not let it go. It\u2019s not like I was using the same spoon for both of them, they were in separate pans on different burners!\n\nThe distraction caused me to burn the stuffing that was in the oven. Then I told her fine, you win and I threw out the dish I was preparing for her. I said she could make her own food.\n\nIt kind of put a damper on the rest of the day and everyone was mad at me for throwing her food out.\n\nMy sister wound up making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and had some of the vegan-friendly sides, but she still won\u2019t talk to me.\n\nMy mom said that I should have just finished making it and that she would have come around. She said I ruined Stacey\u2019s Thanksgiving, but I think Stacey ruined her own Thanksgiving by being so anal about the vicinity of animal products around her food.\n\nSo AITA here?", "created_utc": 1669508090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5macr/aita_for_making_my_sister_cook_her_own_food/", "score": 199, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She knew her food was going to be prepared in a kitchen that was also preparing meat food. This was 100% forseeable. Her reaction was over-the-top and non-sensical, and now she is tantruming like a child.\n\nSounds like your mom has been spoiling Stacey for far too long.", "NTA.\n\nMy husband is a Vegan and I cook the entire T-Dinner on the the same range and make sure the vegan cooking spoons are on one side of the stove, and the non-vegan on the other.\n\nHis meatless roast was in the oven at the same time as the beef roast for the rest of us.  I arranged foil on both pans to block potential splatter.\n\nYour sister is being THAT Vegan and can fuck right off.", "NTA. Does she go to regular restaurants and insists the chefs stop cooking all meals until hers is finished?!\n\nShe sounds awful. Does she often pick up new habits and act crazy about them? She needs therapy.", "NTA. That was an entitled and spoiled brat reaction! She KNEW you were cooking meat and turkey. What did she think was gonna happen? If she didn\u2019t like the food was being made in the same kitchen then she can cook for herself. \n\nFrankly, with big meals like Thanksgiving and Christmas and such the only obligations a host must consider are allergies and any religious guidelines if they differ from host\u2019s. Any voluntary food preferences can be prepared by the person themselves. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA and your mom needs to stop coddling her!", "NTA. I'm just wondering what exactly she was expecting- she knows YOU'RE not vegan, and still had to make non-vegan food. Did she expect you to prepare them in a separate kitchen?! and if she's ever dined at a non-vegan restaurant, I hate to break it to her but her vegan food will have been cooked on surfaces that non-vegan foods have been cooked on. And I think your mom shouldn't have commented on the situation. Maybe your sister would have come around, but how on earth were you supposed to know that after her over-dramatic reaction? \n\n\nFWIW, i'm not vegan but I'm vegetarian- have been since I was 12. When I was a teenager I remember being like your sister, freaking out at restaurants where I could see my vegetarian burger was being flipped by the same spatula as the beef burgers. But eventually I realized that's the nature of restaurants that serve both regular and special dietary options. There's always that risk- and if it's not a legit allergy then they aren't necessarily going to be cautious about it. Now that i'm older I appreciate they even offer vegetarian options and I am choosing to take that risk if I go anywhere (be it a restaurant or person's house) to eat where they serve meat.", "NTA- what she should have said is \"thank you\". Nobody wants to be micromanaged... especially in their own kitchen. That is never going to go down well.", "NTA.\n\nBeing vegan, in the West, is almost always a lifestyle choice.\n\nShe should cook for herself.", "NTA\n\nCooking dinner for everyone is a lot and then making accommodations can complicate things more. IF she was so picky about her food then she should have made her own dish.", "NTA. What's with all the self-righteous pain in the ass vegans on this sub? The sister was being impossible when you were kind enough to make her a special dish. I don't blame you for getting frustrated and throwing it out. Fuck her.", "NTA - you aren\u2019t her private chef. If she didn\u2019t want things cooked on the sam range just bring her own w her.", "NTA- if she was that concerned about cross contamination she should have made a couple of vegan dishes and brought them herself. Not to mention, asking someone who\u2019s cooking the marathon thanksgiving dinner, to accommodate their dietary requirements is rude. You already had enough to do without worrying about her vegan dish. I do not ask my non vegan friends to accommodate my vegan diet.", "Nta. While for many vegans cross contamination is something they don\u2019t do in their own homes and with roommate situations\u2026 to be a guest in non-vegans home doesn\u2019t mean she should expect the same accommodations. It\u2019s horribly entitled to expect that you know her unspoken rules. If it was that much of an issue, she could have brought her own \u201cnon contaminated\u201d food.", "NTA. She went overboard when you were trying to accommodate her", "NTA. You offered and went out of your way to provide a vegan alternative. If she's that upset and picky, she should bring her OWN prepared meal.\n\nShe sounds insuffable and entitled.", "NTA & wanna say regular bread is NOT  vegan cuz eggs & milk.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. This is why vegans have the reputation they have.", "NTA, and bread isn't vegan.", "NTA. If she was concerned about cross contamination on a day you're cooking multiple dishes for a large gathering, she shouldn't have asked you to prepare something but asked to bring her own dish, or a dish to share. To go off on you because you \"could\" have contaminated it and distract you so another dish was burned was rude.", "ESH Throwing the dish out was overkill and a waste of food.\n\nSaying \u201cfine, you finish the dish, I\u2019ll focus on the gravy and stuffing\u201d would have been fine.\n\nI get it. Sisters. And you were incredibly busy. But the title \u201cmaking my sister cook her own food\u201d is deceptive. You didn\u2019t just do that. You also threw a bit of a tantrum.
