I've told my parents, \"I don't care who you leave your assets to, but I'm not going to fight over anything if your wills are unclear.\"", "NTA. I\u2019m dreading the eventual settling of my own parents\u2019 estates with as of the properties are going to be left to me and my brother equally, and we get along fantastically. It would be a worthless thing to spend time, effort, and money on if neither the property itself not financial benefits were wanted.\n\nAsk your mom to pick out some of her most cherished, smaller items to designate as being left to you instead (regardless of what you plan to do with them ultimately).", "You have every right to decline a legacy.\n\nThis is moot problem.\n\nGo have some fun without the sibs.", "You don't have to accept an inheritance.

Your mom's emotional reaction doesn't make you the asshole. You're being upfront about not wanting to be involved in the mess that'll follow.

I anticipated the shit show to some extent. But the hell he put me through with the estate sale and maintenance on her house was certainly not worth what I got out of it. We came to blows more than once, the police were summoned more than once; all to be screwed out of money I'll never get back. If I had to do it all over again, I would have just walked the hell away, never spoken to him again and said to hell with the inheritance.\n\nIf I'd asked my mom to leave it all to him she wouldn't have done it. (She would have been more likely to leave it all to me, but wouldn't have wanted for me to bear the burden alone.) I know she hoped we'd get along after she passed. But she unintentionally left me tied to the biggest type A narcissist of all time. The thing is, if your parents leave you in the will, your siblings can't legally sell without you signing off on it. If I had just ghosted my brother he wouldn't have legally been able to sell the house, but would have had to bear the costs of maintenance and upkeep to maintain the value. \n\nI completely understand where you're coming from. Parents need to understand. This is real life. This isn't some after school special where the kids lean on each other to get through a tough time together.

Well, I'm guessing that can't be said about your siblings since you don't talk to them, but we'll just focus on you and mom.\n\nYou are completely within your right to not accept inheritance, and if mom won't let it go you can more than likely just sign off your \"share\" through probate.

Please, stay in the will and take what is rightfully yours, that your parents wish you to have.\n\nThis is what you should do. After the last parent dies, get yourself an attorney. Then, when it comes time to deal with the will \\*have your attorney handle everything for you.\\* So the siblings will speak to the attorney, \\*not to you\\*. That way, you won't have to deal with them.
