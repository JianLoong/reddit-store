We have a lovely 7-year-old son named Max, whom we adopted as a baby. I also have an older sister, Sarah, who has always supported me in my choices, but the focus of this story is my younger brother, Mark.  \n\nMark is 28 years old, and as far back as I can remember, he has been extremely homophobic and openly vocal about it. He loves to insult the LGBTQ+ community, including me and my husband. This drove a wedge between us to the point where we barely spoke unless necessary.  \n\nNow, about the recent incident: Mark got into financial trouble due to a series of bad decisions and was evicted from his apartment. Despite our differences, I couldn't let my own brother be homeless. So, I offered him a place to stay temporarily until he gets back on his feet. My husband, Alex, was hesitant, but he agreed because family is family.  \n\nWhile he was at my house, we tried to maintain a healthy environment for Max's sake. We didn't want our son exposed to Mark's homophobic views, so we set some rules - no hateful comments, and he needed to keep his beliefs to himself while under our roof.  \n\nEverything was fine for a while, but today was my husband's birthday, and we decided to invite our friends and family over for a barbecue at our house. I was manning the grill while Alex played with Max in the pool, and Mark was a bit further away, drinking with some cousins. When we all sat down to eat, I decided to make a toast in honor of my husband, and that's when Mark, completely intoxicated, started making various highly homophobic remarks directed at me and Alex. Max, who was sitting with us, was clearly disturbed by his uncle's comments.\n\nAt that point, I couldn't take it anymore. I reprimanded him in front of everyone at the table, highlighting how harmful his words were and how they affected our son.  \n\nMark was furious with the reprimand, accused me of being overly sensitive, and tried to justify his prejudiced opinions. The situation quickly became tense and awkward for everyone at the table. I lost my patience and said things in a heated tone that I shouldn't have. I yelled at Mark, calling him an idiot and stating that I wouldn't tolerate his homophobia in my home, and told him to pack his things and leave.  \n\nThe atmosphere became tense, and Alex tried to calm the situation. Mark was furious, packed his things, and left our house.  \n\nNow, our family is divided. Some believe Mark provoked the situation with his homophobic views, while others think I was too harsh and became the jerk in the situation since he has nowhere else to go. So, Reddit: AITA?\n\nEdit:\nI saw someone asking what Mark said, in addition to wondering why other relatives don't welcome him, and I think it's good to explain, but unfortunately, it won't fit in this post, so I'll respond in the comments.", "created_utc": 1697237797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177b71d/aita_for_kicking_out_my_homophobic_brother_and/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He said I shouldn't act as if we were a real couple when we shouldn't even be considered human beings. Mark immediately laughed as if it were the funniest joke in the world.\n\nAs for the relatives not accommodating him, my husband and I have a great standard of living. I'm a lawyer, and he's a surgeon, and we have various investments that have yielded well in recent years. We're not rich, but we can comfortably live, and we could easily accommodate one more person in our house.
