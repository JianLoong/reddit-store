I'm now making well over double what my wife (37f) makes at her job. I've always made about double.  We live pretty comfortably, rent but have two cars, and can buy whatever we need including luxury items like gaming consoles, tv's etc. We dont go on vacations or spend foolishly. We split everything 50/50 and have our own bank accounts, she gives me her share of the rent every month and I pay. If I pay for something like a hotel, she gives the money for her half.\nRecently the subject of her paying less came up. She suggested that we each pay an equal percentage of our earnings towards rent and household utilities.(eg, we each pay 30% of our salary towards rent and utilities) She says she's been using her credit cards to pay for things since she can't afford rent plus utilities and groceries on her salary and they are close to maxed. She's never mentioned this, and I don't think I should be held responsible for her inability to manage money. We chose our place together and she should have picked something she could afford better not make me pay more in the future because she is now struggling as she puts it. I work hard for my money and am putting away savings to use as a downpayment on a house in the future. I already don't go on any big vacations or expensive outings as I know she can't afford her half. \nShe is angry with me and says I'm financially abusing her. I think I'm justified in keeping my money for me. I buy her nice things here and there and occasionally will pay for dinner, it's more than a lot of husbands do.\n\nAITA for making my wife pay her fair share of things?", "created_utc": 1695505072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qg0ze/aita_for_making_my_wife_pay_half_of_everything/", "score": 1002, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.
