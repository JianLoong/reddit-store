I am currently 25 weeks pregnant and expecting a little boy at the end of June. For context my sister and I have never been close growing up and even into adulthood. I feel that growing up I was always the \"path of least resistance\" child and therefore whenever my sister threw one of her tantrums it was always \"oh just let it be\" or \"oh she's your sister just drop it\" because I was always the one that would back down first, and my parents knew this and took advantage of as I've come to learn since getting older. \n\nMy sister doesn't talk to me unless its because she needs something from me. I will even message her to ask her something or make a comment on something, and she won't even reply to me half the time. I've taken a big step back over the past couples years from trying to have a relationship with her. Now that I'm pregnant I want to tell my sister that I don't want her at the hospital after my son is born. I would like to have mine and my boyfriends families come to the hospital to meet our son after he is born, but my sister hasn't messaged me once my entire pregnancy to see how I'm doing or made any effort to contact me. I know when the day comes that I go into labour though she will be the first one calling me to come to the hospital and meet him because she'll want to get pictures with him so she can post it all over social media, and I don't want her there if she's only going to use my son for a photo op.  I'm not saying she can't meet him at all - but my boyfriend and I are thinking about having the first 2 weeks after he's born to ourselves and then begin allowing extended family to come meet him etc.   \n\nI mentioned something to my dad about this today, and he's already (in my mind) taking her side and telling me to \"stop acting this way\" and to \"not even bring it up.\" I called him out for saying that because he knows that she'll throw a tantrum and it'll become a big deal. I'm just tired of her getting to decide when she wants to be a part of my life or not. I'm 27 years old now and I plan on starting to hold my ground when it comes to my boundaries and how she makes me feel. I've always struggled with putting up boundaries and it didn't help growing up that my parents would tare mine down to please her.", "created_utc": 1678568864, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ov5ft/wibta_if_i_didnt_let_my_sister_come_to_the/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it's a good idea to wait a couple weeks before receiving company, as well. If you know your parents will side against you, don't tell them anything anymore. You giving birth is YOUR time and everyone else can either respect your wishes or don't bother you at all. At the hospital, tell the nurses who you will and won't allow in your room.

If you told your sister you can tell them that certain family members force their way and that you just dont want any stress.

My sister  & i are not close, and i only want those i feel close to, and whove treated me fairly and kindly coming to the hospital after the baby is born.  If you cannot accept this, you can wait to meet the baby later,  when you feel ready to respect my feelings.  If you persist in  advocating for my sister, at the hospital, i will ask you to leave. I want no stress because it can affect milk and the baby eating\".  \n\nYou have to take a stance for yourself.  You will be a mother soon and you need to be strong and advocate for yourself so your child will learn to not let people run over them.  This is not the same as raising an entitled child.", "NTA and make a plan with the hospital to block her from seeing you or coming into the delivery room.
