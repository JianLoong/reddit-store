But their opinion of the situation remains the same, that despite now knowing she was right and what she did was safer for women he would still and will still insist on the \u201cproper\u201d his words way.", "It can\u2019t \u201cslip between\u201d because that\u2019s not how women\u2019s clothing works. Our clothing goes over our bodies, it isn\u2019t a second skin, and not every woman with a large chest has a big ol valley there. A lot of women with large breasts have breasts that touch in the middle. \n\nI\u2019m very curious to know your location, because it\u2019s illegal to not be able to dispute a traffic ticket in both the United States and the United Kingdom.", "YTA. You\u2019re not a girl so you can\u2019t understand how there\u2019s really no winning with seatbelts. They either go across your neck, or under your boobs, especially if you\u2019re wearing a bra. Boobs are round, the seatbelt will not stay between them, it will slide up. Having it under the books is the only way for it to actually stay, and stay off your neck.\n\nApparently it\u2019s also safer to have the seatbelt under your boobs, as that way in an accident it doesn\u2019t hurt your neck.\n\nSo not only did you call unnecessary attention to her, you were also loudly wrong. How you can claim to be checking belts as though you know what you\u2019re talking about when you were wrong is ridiculous.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your body or business. Quit being controlling of other people", "Yta. Just so weird of you to do. So weird. They're not your children ffs.", "YTA seatbelts don't sit comfortably across boobs. It's hard to get it to stay across your chest, and generally it will move itself above your boobs and cuts across your neck. So yeah, as someone without boobs you're an asshole for telling her how to wear her seatbelt", "YTA if she is wearing her seat belt and is not a child, leave it alone!!!!! She had it on in a way that was comfortable and safe for HER. You do NOT need to be looking at her chest. And no. It is NOT illegal to put it under her boobs. Grow up", "Does she have big fat tits brother?", "Everyone, this kid is from Australia, not the US. Over here, seatbelts being worn correctly (NOT under the boobs) is a huge thing, and the driver can be fined if his passengers aren't wearing their seatbelts correctly. In my state, it's a $1200 fine, but in most states it's at least $400. I don't know about you, but I definitely check if my passengers are wearing their seat belts correctly to make sure I don't get a huge fine", "NTA. \n\nIf your mate has an issue, stop the car and politely, but firmly ask them to walk.", "NTA. You sound levelheaded and you're sensible. Your mate is a bit of a drama llama.", "NTA, and two your friends that his GF isn't your toe, she looks to much like your cousin or some shit. \n\nIs, if you want to be an ass tell him that his GF looks like a dude with man boobs and you really aren't into that sort of thing but you're glad he found someone he finds attractive.", "Friend obviously thought OP wanted to get a grip on those boobies, not thinking of how destroyed the twins - and the rest of her - would be in an accident.", "One of my proudest uncle moments was when I was giving my niece and her friends a ride somewhere. They all get in and my niece tells her friends to put on their seatbelts or we aren\u2019t going anywhere.", "He\u2019s the one driving.  He\u2019s the one who will have to deal with that if he is in a car crash and she dies.  So yeah, one seat belt at a time.  \u201crELaX bRo\u2026\u201d", "As a girl who is 5\u20192-3 with E cups, I feel confident in saying you\u2019re absolutely wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s safer to have the belt under your boobs than it is to have it between them, because it won\u2019t stay between them. It will slide up to your neck, which is uncomfortable and unsafe. What she did is actually the safe option, and exactly what she should have done.\n\nBetter to break a rib or get bruised up than snap your neck.", "I'm sorry, but for busty and short people if belt is put between boobs then it can go on neck, and in accident it will just choke to death. Seatbelts are mostly designed for men, and tested on tall no-tits test dummies. This means that if someone is bustier it can be safer to wear them under boobs (which can break ribs, and sometimes make person dead from internal bleeding) or have special adapter. Without adapter it's just way to choose which way you wanna die if accident happens (but with seatbelt under boobs you have more time, and better chance to not die than nearly immediately choking without good chance to take it out, usually more dangerous)", "As someone from Australia who actually understands your dilemma, booster cushions would probably help (could get like office seat cushions from Kmart). You could also get these seat belt covers (they're just like bits of fabric that cover the seat belt) and they stop it from being uncomfortable if it rubs against the neck when she wears it the way you legally have to. They also stop the seat belt from being crazy hot when you put it on in the middle of summer. I like that you're being  considerate of your female friends, and looking into this, while also following the laws that you have to.", "Where I live if you\u2019re the driver you will be ticketed for a passenger not wearing a seatbelt. (If a passenger in your car is younger than 16 and not wearing a seatbelt, you will be given a ticket. If the passenger is over 16, you will both receive tickets.)\n\nSo yes, the driver should always make sure passengers are wearing seatbelts and it\u2019s fine if he wants to insist they were them correctly.", "So wrong , so so wrong . The rear passengers can definitely endanger the one in front of them in a high speed crash if they don't wear seatbelts. Im amazed that i even have to say this.", "Paramedic AND coroner?\nSo you are fine with either outcome when youre at work? /joke", "Having a seat belt under your boobs is safer than over them, which is where the belt will slide if you put it between them. Boobs are round, the seat belt will not stay between them. What she did is correct, and safer than the alternative.", "So you also anchor down everything you carry as well captain paranoia?  Do you seatbelt your freaking gallon of milk?  How about maybe when you buy a new tool from Home Depot. You put that in a protective bubble?  Don\u2019t say trunk because most SUV\u2019s just have a hatchback. Damn, I don\u2019t believe I have to say this!", "Everyday one learns something new and learns to be more empathetic. Thank you for that. \n\n\nOP is NTA. OP is exposed to the standardized and expected norms of safety. It is in no way considered to be a boob check. Even if OP has had a history with the person.", "Try a different adapter or a booster seat if you are that short.  The seatbelt needs to go across your torso to protect you. Your safety is important.\n\nI am 5'2\".  I use an adjuster and position the seatbelt as low as it will attach to the door frame.  The belt goes across my shoulder instead of my neck.", "I can tuck it under my boob or let it sit across my neck.  Either way in a bad crash it\u2019s likely to kill me.  For the time when I\u2019m not in a crash I\u2019d rather not get friction burns on my neck.  You\u2019re a know-it-all who doesn\u2019t actually understand the realities of wearing a seatbelt as a female and insisted on what you thought was better.", "You feel even better that you checked her? Give me a break. You get the belt into position with an accessory that moves the cross point. Get some of those or shut up. The only other option  is to remove the boobs. You're an asshole", "Stop staring at his girl\u2019s tits!", "I'm 5'5''. Safety is not having the belt go across my throat.", "We don't know what country OP is in. In my country, it's a $1200 fine for the driver if all their passengers aren't wearing their seatbelts correctly (and yes, that includes seat belts under the boobs). I totally get why he was so anal about this", "Did you think this thread was about you specifically?", "he just wanted the tits to be calm if he needs to hit the breaks", "Yes you corrected her from having under her boobs to near her neck. Thank you for saving her, her neck will so happy if you crash now", "Excuse my bluntness but would you rather your female passengers heads be cut clean off or their ribs being broken?", "So you have breasts? How does she achieve this, cos as someone with breasts you'd have to take your top off . Stop mansplaining and fucking listen to what the actual fucking women here are telling you", "That's still a good fucking reason unless she's paying she can put it on.\n\nAnd why can't it be both reasons?"]}
