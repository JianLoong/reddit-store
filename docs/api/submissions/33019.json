Even in a minor accident this can kill you. \n\n- go under the boobs, which increases the risk of broken ribs and punctured lungs, but you\u2019re less likely to die instantly. In the case of a minor accident you will survive. \n\n- buy an adapter that shifts the belt to go up the middle of your torso and through your cleavage.

If you are shorter than the average male (which most women are) and/or have breasts (which most women do), then the seatbelt doesn\u2019t sit on your shoulder.  It ends up on your collarbone/neck.  Which is **not safe.**", "Properly for men. You need to get this through your head. \u201cProper\u201d for a man is DANGEROUS for a woman. She wasn\u2019t wearing it how you wanted it to be.

You may not intend for it to be, but many of your subsequent comments have been infantilizing, misogynistic, dismissive, and they lack nuance. It\u2019s mansplaining too\u2014this is a frequently misused buzzword today but in this case it\u2019s accurate. You just learned about how seatbelts aren\u2019t designed for women and yet you think you know more than them about how best to stay safe. \n\nIt is impossible for many women to wear seatbelts as they were designed, because they were designed for humans without boobs. It would be like trying to put a pair of glasses on someone who doesn\u2019t have ears or a nose. It simply does not work. \n\nYou\u2019re not wrong for wanting everyone to wear a seatbelt. Far too many young people don\u2019t wear a seatbelt and far too many die because of it. Your friend was wrong for accusing you of leering. \n\nBut you need to understand\u2014what you\u2019re asking is literally impossible for a large portion of the population and being anal about it is both rude and helps nobody. This person was wearing it in a legally acceptable manner that\u2019s actually recommended as an alternative by physicians for women whose breasts are too large to allow that configuration in a particular vehicle. My friend\u2019s OB told her while pregnant & breastfeeding that if she was in a vehicle without an adapter that wearing the seatbelt under her breasts was far safer than wearing it over her neck if the seat design made it go over her neck. Now, you did say that she was able to wear it in an acceptable manner without it being under her breasts, but maybe she\u2019s got a car where that isn\u2019t possible so it\u2019s just a reflex for her. If that wasn\u2019t possible, however, your demand would have had the seatbelt go over her neck which is far more dangerous than her original positioning and your insistence that anyone and everyone wear it like that is concerning because for many, again, it simply isn\u2019t possible. \n\nIf you care about this issue, contribute to or start a campaign to lobby auto manufacturers to change their restraint designs.", "You made her less safe. You didn\u2019t make anything correct because for women SHE WAS CORRECT you made her change it to male standards and risked her life more.", "Yes it absolutely will where she was wearing it under her bust will puncture her lungs with her ribs in a crash.

Harnesses, different belt designs, anything. I fucking hate the idea that anyone can\u2019t be safe in a car cuz of how dudes designed seat belts. But I also know that this passenger at least was able to correct the position of the strap and become safely restrained in my car, so I\u2019m glad I checked and said something.", "According to the NHTSA the chest strap should go between the breasts which is how it was positioned after she moved it, and it sat on her shoulder away from her neck.
