Maybe you should invite her to hang out with us tomorrow; it'd be cool to have a local show us all the cool spots.\"\n\nI literally screamed back, \"Are you serious? Be prepared to be lectured about everything under the sun then. If you don't wear sunscreen and get sunburned, get ready to hear about your risk of skin cancer. And you, Bethany, are using tretinoin, so she won't even let you leave our house without thick-ass nasty Aveeno sunscreen. How do I know this?
