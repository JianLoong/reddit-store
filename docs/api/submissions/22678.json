And you two might end the relationship over it.", "ESH\n\nThis isnt a casual or new relationship, it's 5 years in. Unless I'm lacking information- that comes across as a serious relationship. And in a serious relationship- discussions are generally needed for decisions that affect both parties.\n \nThis will affect her because she will no longer need to remember condoms, worry about tracking her period, and not having sex with you for x amount of time post surgery.\n\n That calls for even a light discussion like you'd have if you were buying a kitchen table. 'hey, I've decided to xyz and wanted to let you know' around the beginning of when you decided to do it. It's acknowledging a level of consideration for the person you're sharing said dick with\n\n\nYou aren't wrong for deciding to do it. You aren't wrong for not letting her actually have a say in the matter. If you don't want kids, ever- that's your right. And any partner you have who disagrees with that is free to leave. End of story. \n\nBut I would've let my partner know around the time I made the decision for myself, just because I believe in including a long term partner in on my life details", "YTA for lacking basic communication skills. I\u2019m not saying you need permission. I agree your body your choice but surgery and life changing decisions is something you communicate with your long term partner.", "YTA. Not to say you shouldn\u2019t get a vasectomy even against her wishes. But if you are in a long term, exclusive relationship you talk about life changing decisions before you make them. Would you want her to make a decision that effects your future without consulting you. Like if she was on birth control just going off without giving you a say? Your body is always your choice but when you share your body the other person should have input", "Nta its your body you can do what you want with it as long as the money came from your own salary/spending money. Though she might have gone into the relationship thinking: I don't want kids now but I'll want them eventually I'll convince him when the time comes for now I'll just say I don't want them. I don't know your gf of course so this is pure speculation on what could be possible.", "NTA\n\nYou agreed that you didn't want kids. \n\nShe doesn't want to take pills, get a UID etc. You are not trying to force her to take responsibility; you are taking responsibility. \n\nMaybe an earlier conversation would have been helpful, but I don't really even think THAT. There was no operation imminent - you were just starting to save so that you could do the responsible thing.

I assume you were going to tell her before the operation, in case she'd changed her mind about ever having kids?

For starters that is NOT where I anticipated this going.... based off the mention of hormones for her I full on expected you to say you wanted her to get on something.  The fact that as a man you stepped up and took ownership over the risk of pregnancy not happening again is great.  You had already had the talk with her about neither of you wanting children so it shouldn't have been a big deal to her unless she was either lieing from the jump thinking you'd change your mind eventually or she simply changed her mind and never brought it up. Either way you're NTA here.", "NTA", "NTA!!!!! youre right in saying your body, your choice, because its true.

If she became pregnant, you would have no say whether she carries the child or not.  If she declined to engaged in sexual conduct, you would not have any place to engage in such conduct.  If she chooses to take some contraceptive, you have no right to interject yourself between her and her doctor.  Likewise, she has no place saying what you choose to do with your body.  If you choose to be sterile, that's your choice.  She has zero say in it. She had no right to be angry with you.  She's just wrong here.", "NTA.

You've been dating this woman for five years, but didn't talk to her about how you were ready to take this step, or how hard it was to find a doctor who would agree to do it (since you said you \"finally\" found one, it implies you had to work hard for this), about how it sucks your insurance won't cover all of it but how you planned to save it up, etc. \n\nIt's absolutely 100% your call on whether to do this. As far as the decision itself... your body your choice is correct. But I am confused as to why your partner of five years did not know about this for half a year and only found out on accident as opposed to any sort of conversation with you. \n\nDo you and your girlfriend really talk so little about your lives that you didn't discuss ANY aspect of this entire situation for half a year? Hell, for over a half a year - since you don't say how long the search for the doctor took before you even started the six months of saving.", "Hell yes YTA.

Yes, it is your body and you can do what you feel is best. However, you never made any attempt to discuss with her about doing the procedure. \n\nIf she decided to get an abortion, you would be ok with not even being consulted? If the answer is yes, then great, but clearly she does not feel that way. \n\nI would hope that someone I\u2019m with for 5 years would tell me about going to do a procedure like that.

This clearly isn't something still in the thinking process as you have a Dr and are saving the money. Since you seemingly have the same stance on kids then I'd think this would be a relief to her \n\nI will say this though you're supposed to be partners and you condescendingly used \"my body my choice\" to basically just shut her up", "NTA if you agreed to be child free she has absolutely no say. If you agreed to \u201ckids down the road\u201d I could see it as lying by omission. \n\nThe real question is why is she so mad \ud83e\udd14", "NTA you are correct your body your choice. You do not want to have kids. Darling she may have hoped you\u2019d change your mind or she\u2019s changed hers. You need to make it clear you are having the surgery and she needs to decide what she really wants.", "NTA.\n\nGood job recognizing the ultimate solution for you, and committing to your choice. \n\nDid you have a discussion about \"hey I discovered my insurance will cover 60% of this procedure\" with her? \n\nI'm projecting, but I feel like she's taken aback because to her point of view you decided to get a surgery without discussing it with her. But if you talked about the insurance discovery at all, I'd remind her that you did have that conversation. \n\nJust maybe you didn't explicitly say \"hey I'm starting this savings account for this surgery\" but the discussion about insurance coverage would have cued most people in that it was on your mind.\n\nIt's also possible she didn't want to discontinue condoms, and is upset that you were making that decision without discussing it. Maybe she has a particular reason she wants to keep using them. \n\nA calm discussion is definitely in order.", "NTA. Neither of you want kids and you're taking steps to guarantee that, what's the issue? Was her kid stance a bait and switch perhaps?", "NTA. This is a decision you are making about your body and your future. While it\u2019s great to share info about your plans with any partner, permission or approval is not something required for reproductive choices. Im glad you have found a doctor you feel good about and are taking the necessary steps to look after your body in the way that feels right to you.\n\nEdited to add: if your Gf has changed her mind about wanting kids, that\u2019s also her right and that may mean you two aren\u2019t suited for eachother long term.", "You are a", "NAH you can want a vasectomy, but I think it is something you should have told your girlfriend about and I think it\u2019s within her right to be annoyed that you didn\u2019t even talk to her about it.

Also you sounded like you were very shitty with her about it instead of actually discussing it with her and completely dismissed her feelings.

But it sounds like she is having second thoughts", "NTA for your reasons but maybe you're not both on the same page.", "NTA because it's true, but objectively, both of you seem terrible at communicating. If you're both in a committed relationship, discussing it again would've been a good idea because she clearly feels a certain way about it, but cold shouldering isn't healthy communication. A conversation you had 5 years ago may still hold true, but then again, it may not, and making a decision like that which would ultimately affect both of you is worth talking about. However, vasectomies are not foolproof, and using contraceptives (especially multiple) is always the safest bet if you want to avoid the inevitable outcome.", "Right on the whole your body your rules...but you are a bit of an ass in the communication's department.

Then she ended up getting pregnant with another guy\u2019s baby \ud83d\ude24", "Of course he does, just bringing up the point that people change quite a bit after their 20s, especially in terms of lifestyles. Who knows what they really want when they are 24 years old? Talking about girlfriend here since she is the one who changed her mind. So if it didn\u2019t come up recently, I could see why she would be a little perturbed because it\u2019s a big decision that affects both of them", "OP did absolutely nothing wrong at all here. They had multiple conversations. He's the asshole because what? She secretly changes her mind, or wasn't truthful when they had their multiple conversations on the topic?", "Someone doesn\u2019t freak out at your own choices unless they want to do something about them or try to control it, I\u2019m assuming based off experience.", "Nowhere does it say they have joint accounts. And even if they did, he wasn't moving money from a joint account to his savings. He was saving his own money, for a procedure on his body, that he wanted.", "I was explaining in a neutral way for the benefit of communication.\n\nFor myself, if I got pregnant and I didn't want to be, no one's opinion on the matter would really stop me. Sure, they get to have an opinion, but in the major scope, it doesn't do anything. On the other hand, if I decided I wanted to keep being pregnant, someone can't inflict a treatment on me to stop it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a caveat, I think child support only exists as a necessary evil because, as a population, we must consider the child. I would much prefer a system where the whole population is responsible for child support, instead of putting it directly on the parent who did not want a child.", "And if you would actually read my original comment, I never said that she should have a say. However, OP did not bother to tell her about the procedure, so if she didn\u2019t find out, it would be a surprise. How would you feel if your S/O of 5 years saved up money for weeks or months and underwent a procedure without even telling you? Is she expected to take care of him as well, for a procedure he didn\u2019t even bother to tell her about? Vasectomies do have a recovery period.", "It should have been discussed with her.. just as I will bring up me likely getting a tubal in the future with a potentialpartner, because people can and do change thejr minds. As it will determine what path the future takes for both individuals. A heads up at least is bare minimum. She probably also feels upset that he doesn't see the point of telling her. Someone who loves him, knowing at all. Idk about you, but when I was with my ex I'd talk to her about everything. Including reproductive decisions. By doing so we check in that we are on the same page of things", "Y\u2019all must not have relationships bruh \ud83d\ude02 Reddit just wants roommates that they sleep with. IN A FIVE YEAR RELATIONSHIP, you tell your partner if you\u2019re doing something big like that, regardless of if their input matters or not.", "It\u2019s not about questioning it. It\u2019s about being in a long term committed relationship and at the very least letting your partner *know* you\u2019re having a procedure done. I\u2019m not saying he should ask permission. Jesus.", "She may not have changed her mind, but she might not be as \u201cfinal\u201d about that decision as he is. He is choosing to 1. Undergo major surgery that will require some recovery 2. Put money aside for said operation and most importantly 3. Make a pretty permanent decision. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get the final say on his choice. But she does deserve to know. His choice does effect her and their relationship as well. And she also gets to choose if this is what she wants for her life. And she should be able to make that choice sooner (as in while it\u2019s still in the planning stage) rather than later (as in if their already married).", "She still deserves to know about the procedure. She should not have had to find out this way. If there was no secrets, why not tell her upfront?", "I figured you were saying he should have weighed her in from the lines \n\u201cdiscuss with her about doing the procedure.\u201d and \u201c\u2026you would be okay with not even being consulted?\u201d.\nalso, i agreed with you about how op should tell her about a big procedure.", "I was in a marriage... with the man for 10 years... I'm not a \"bruh\" for starters funny that you would assume that though. When I got with my ex husband initially i was pretty clear I didn't want kids.  While that did not change HAD I CHANGED MY MIND make damn sure I would have relayed that information to him. I", "She made that choice when she chose to tell him she was ok never having children when they started dating.  He was very clear he was never having kids. You don't get to flip the script 5 years into a relationship and be mad.", "What he does with his body is his business. Does he need to ask her to brush his teeth? Clip his toenails? Get a tattoo? What about a piercing? She has no say over what he does with his body.", "Were they not teenagers when they made that decision?? Lol\n\nWhen I was teenager I never wanted to get married. God forbid I\u2019m stuck with the decision I made 10 years ago.", "I would be hurt if my husband altered his body without talking to me. It is not about control, it is about communication and willingly letting your partner into your life and decisions. If you think like ypu commented, you are not truly ready for a long commited relationship or marriage.\n\nAnd the latest discussion they seemed to have was 2 years ago. Things change. They are in their 20s. These topics need to be fresh to be relevant", "And again IF SHE changed her mind during that time that is up to HER to communicate that when she realized it... and 22 is not a teenager", "I didn\u2019t want kids since forever and I knew it, my mind hasn\u2019t changed and I\u2019m over 30  now. \n\nSome people know what they want early in life, some don\u2019t and then make it a problem for other people.", "It absolutely is about control. And if things change, it's on the side that changes to bring it up. How was he supposed to know things changed? Who didn't communicate here. They had multiple conversations on the topic. Came to an agreement on the topic. She may have changed her mind, but did he know that? No. If a woman wanted to get birth control (and I say that because I'm well aware of the bullshit about tubal ligation) and went on birth control without telling her partner would she be the asshole? Hell no, cause it's her body, her choice. Why doesn't that same standard apply here? That's a serious question.", "This!", "That\u2019s so wonderful for you! Congrats!! \n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like the girlfriend is making it OP\u2019s problem. Sounds like she wanted some basic communication.", "Like her communication about maybe changing her mind and not blowing up at him for something she shouldn\u2019t have?\n\nYeah i agree, she needs to work on her bullshit"]}
