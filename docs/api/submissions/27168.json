Shame on both of you for robbing this woman of her childhood and making excuses for you egregious neglect.", "YTA, how do you know how hard she tried? Sounds like she went through a rough patch herself and in times like that it can seem like you aren't trying when you are. Double asshole for being a dick during a sentimental moment. Even if she truly didn't try she was just explaining the embarrassment she felt as a teen and opening up about her struggles with you guys. You ruined it by not being supportive and congratulating her on what she's accomplished now. Don't be shocked when she doesn't come to you in the future.", "YTA. It sounds like your sister was seriously neglected at a crucial time in her education. When we're talking about minors, 'caregiver burnout' is more accurately called abuse. A 12 year old should not be responsible for her sick mother. \n\nAnd now you have the audacity to blame her for it? You're cruel.", "YTA\n\nGo fucking apologize to your sister that you were not there for her,  (or your mom and your brother) during the time that your mother was so ill your sister's GRADE SCHOOL education was put on hold.\n\nYour brother is sympathetic because he saw what was going on.", "YTA\n\nShe graduated high school while caring for an infirm parent. (Let\u2019s not forget that you\u2019ve suggested that at least some of your mothers health problems came from her unwillingness to seek appropriate preventative care, a situation that is unbelievably frustrating). I think the fact that she was able to graduate and is now in community college is commendable. I hope that she is able to find peace and happiness as she moves forward. \n\nIt is completely inappropriate to suggest that a teenager should have \u201cbetter managed\u201d her time in the circumstances she was in. She also deserved to have a life, and not spend all her time caring or studying. \n\nWhere were you while this was all happening? Surely you were also caring for your mother if you\u2019re so willing to pass judgment on her teenage self for how she handled responsibilities she should never have had to shoulder?", "YTA, imagine taking care of your mother when you're 12 then having your brother criticise the consequences of that when your in your mid 20s.  \n\nAnd it seems like she is still in college so your words might actually demotivate her in her studies now too.", "I just want to be clear here, you were 26 years old when your mom's health started failing. Your brother was 17. Rather than step up and help, you both relied ENTIRELY on your 12 YEAR OLD sister to provide her with all the care? To the extent that your sister's entire life has suffered because of what you forced her  tr give up? What the actual fuck?? You have desperately failed your sister. Where she is in life is a DIRECT result of your failing  as a sibling. Forcing a child to forgo their entire education to help their ailing parent is an awful thing to do.

You have no right to judge your sister. YTA", "Your sister agrees with you because she likely was given a thankless existence, she can\u2019t even see that she was essentially a slave taking care of her mother out of obligation when if anything, You and your brother (though he was still young too, but he at least Tried to help in some way) should have been supporting your mother so she could recover.\n\nYour sister was 15/16 you say? Right at the age when the only thing she should have been worried on was her studies, developing an identity & socializing, and Maybe getting herself a part time job. Instead she was stuck with being the Medical care giver as a minor with limited resources and knowledge, and assistance to do so on top of trying to maintain the norm. All the while your ill mother was expected to educate her? There\u2019s no way that such a thing would ever be feasible, homeschooling barely makes the marks to begin with without proper coordination with schooling districts. \n\nShe should have no shame for her life as she shouldn\u2019t have been burdened with it. And what would have happened if anything happened to your - quite honestly - medicine adverse mother under your sister\u2019s supervision? She probably would have taken the shame of it too when - again - it wasn\u2019t her responsibility. \n\nI\u2019m honestly saddened nobody intervened and gave her proper home support or Something so that she wasn\u2019t the one responsible. So not only did you fail to be the better sibling, her school and probably your surrounding family did too since there\u2019s no mention of them? \n\nAs for not \u2018pitying\u2019 people, learn some empathy. It\u2019s not right what she went through, if you can\u2019t see that then you Really need some therapy to work out why. You obviously didn\u2019t care either about your mother or your sibling enough to intervene and you don\u2019t care enough or even despise both enough to show animosity to obvious worthlessness/shame complexes. \n\nAs others said, your sister wasn\u2019t looking for you to judge her and was looking for support from - she hoped - people who might understand. At least John did and still does. \n\nYTA. I hope this wakes her up that she is a far better person than you and likely your \u2018stubborn\u2019 but obviously also insufficient mother.", "Yta", "Yeah, quite soundly YTA on this one.", "YTA. Your brother is right \u2014 You have no idea what your sister went through in those years. I\u2019m sure it was traumatizing as hell. You should be proud of your sister for going to get an education and her degree now, no matter what stage in life she\u2019s in. And to judge her and say \u201cyou could have studied after bathing your mother and putting her to bed\u201d \u2026 i don\u2019t even know how to begin to understand that mindset.

How actually dare you. My gods.", "YTA\n\nShe was 12!!! Omg she never should have been in that position.  No amount of trying hard at that age can make up for lack of adult support.  They\u2019re way too young for google to make up the gap", "Children who are fulltime carers of their parents are not being 'home schooled'. People who are being home schooled have an adult making sure they are being educated. If the child is forced to quit school to be a care giver there is no scenario in which they should have tried harder at self education. Your sister was failed by the adults in her life and society at large. Your sister lost her entire teen years to caring for your mother. Of course her education suffered. YTA", "YTA.\n\nas for the why. Let's see. You abandoned youe family when they were at their lowest. Left your teen sister burn herself out, but hey, she could do more, right? Just take care of her disabled mother and all her needs and somehow figure out a way to be an A+ student and do extracurricular. I am gonna make sure to inform naruto to teach her the shadow clone jutsu to catch up on everything", "YTA honestly wtf her childhood and education was taken away from her because her mother refused to go to a doctor (so yes bad mom sorry not sorry your mom caused it) and y\u2019all made a 12 year old leave school and become her carer? Who home schooled her? Your sick mother? Or May had to teach herself? Fuck right off with that. You put everything on her and then blamed her for not being able to cope?!", "YTA. Read the room my guy. She wasn\u2019t looking for input, she was looking for comfort.

Do have any idea how hard it is to be a caregiver? Especially when you're the main one doing it while trying to juggle everything else in life? If not, then shut up. Because it's one of the hardest things that a person can do. Mentally, physically, emotionally, you lose everything.  To the point where you just feel numb all the time and wish the world would just leave you alone.\n\nAnd I know this from personal experience. Because I spent the last five years as my grandfather's main caretaker, all while working a fulltime job of at least 60 hours a week. I was lucky if I got three hours of sleep most nights. As I never knew when my grandfather would start hollering for me. \n\nI've hated every minute of it. Hardly anyone in my family helped. They just went on with life. Saying that since I was the one that was there, then he was my responsibility. That it was selfish of me want to focus on myself or my own life. Because my grandfather was the one that needed me. I would have other things once he passed away. It made me sick and even now I don't forgive them. Doubt I ever will.\n\nMy only saving grace was SO. Who was the only one who gave a damn about me or how I felt. I never would've made it that far without him.\n\nWhich is why I feel for May. She was robbed of both her childhood and the chance of a better future. All because family members like you are completely ignorant of the struggles she had to put up with while you got to live your life. Which is why I repeat again, just shut up. Until you walk the path that she did, you have NO right to tell May what should or shouldn't have done in the past.", "YTA - what a horrible sibling you are.", "One of the biggest YTA 's ever", "YTA where were you, the adult, when the minor was forced to become a caregiver?", "YTA you should be disgusted with and ashamed of yourself", "YTA. \n\nWhy the hell was a *twelve-year-old girl* the primary carer for her mother?

You are the one who should have tried harder.\n\nYour sister deserves all the accolades.  Her associates degree means more than your graduate degree ever could.", "In your own words.\n\nYou should have tried harder.\n\nYou have the audacity to say it to her. But lack the self reflection you did NOT do it yourself.\n\nI debated typing this because I'm sure it will be lost on you. \nYou see in others what you ignore in yourself.", "So your sister's education was sacrificed at the age of 12, and she was an in-home caregiver for your mother along with your 17 year old brother, when the 26 year old you couldn't do \u00a3#@% to help them out, after all YOUR EDUCATION, YOYR WIFE, YOUR LIFE.. You couldn't do anything to help,  you didn't even visit, but now you're criticising your sister on how she did it all.", "so really it's you who should have tried harder", "What was supposed to happen is you come home and get a job. Graduate school. JFC. You can always return to graduate school,  your sister will never get to have a proper childhood. Wow. YTA", "Stop making excuses. You just didn't want to help because you're lazy and selfish.", "So in other words you actually have *no fucking clue* how hard she did or didn't work, have *no grounds* on which to base this judgement you pulled out of your *ass*, and should probably just back all the way off and apologize.\n\nETA: Also, way to blame the victim of abuse (because educational neglect IS abuse, even if it's for a \"good reason\" like \"mom is sick and needs care\") for not being able to roll with the punches and bounce back from her abuse better. Asshole.", "So her education was an afterthought compared to yours? You call the appropriate ppl & get them help, move them in w you, put mom in a home, whatever. You dont dump your responsibility on a child. Trying to justify it by claiming you were out of state & couldn't travel or that he helped her when said diff in post just makes it worse. You failed", "What ever AH.  You are a total abuser of your younger sister.  She was 12 F-ing years old.  She did not have a childhood because you are a selfish AH. She needs to tell you, your wife and your kids to all FOAD.", "How convenient.\n\nYou dumped all the responsibilities of caring for a sick mother on a teenager who was supposed to be home-schooled BY WHO EXACTLY?\n\nIf May was 15/16, then John was 20/21 and you 29/30. You were in grad school at age 29/30 and had no money to move back or travel?\n\nYou have no place to say anything about this. You abandoned your family and didn't care AT ALL. Absolutely vile. \"Could have tried harder\".", "This is exactly what he should have told her. Mate, we\u2019re our own worst critics after all.", "No. Not at all. I was already out of state when she became sick and couldn't afford coming back.", "She wasnt at that stage yet when she was 12. Moreso when May was 15/16.", "He was only caring about making money and getting his D wet", "Sounds like you could have tried harder. Maybe gotten a night shift job or dropped out.\n\nJust flipping your comment to her", "But your 12 year old sister could \"afford\" to give up *her* life and *her* education to care for your dying mom? You stole all of the chances and ran with them, then blamed her for not trying hard enough. YTA so much that this post must be rage bait.", "No you chose not to come back because your life was more important and shifted the burden for caring for an ailing parent on a child.", "You should have TRIED HARDER. Instead of letting a CHILD become an ill adult's primary caregiver.   \n\n\nYou just keep digging your AH pit deeper, my dude.", "what kind of man sees his mom sick and goes \u201cI don\u2019t have money to come back\u201d - a real man would defied all odds and thought of a way to meet his ailing mom\n\nShame on you for being a crap son.", "Please, just stop making excuses.", "I understand your past position. Unfortunately, others are going to slam you for putting the burden of you mother's well being on your minor sister.\n\nI practically raised my nieces and nephews aided by my younger (also childless)  sister. I was 16 when that began.\n\nYou really don't know what May went through; being 15 and taking on that burden. That wasn't *just* a physically taxing one, but a mental one. Which of *course* affected her studies even if she did take the time and studied more.\n\nYes, it sucks your mother choose not to have an aide and yes, it sucks that her older siblings couldn't help out more, but it happened.\n\nTelling her she should have tried harder or \"made better plans when it came to cares and studying\" *definitely* makes you the asshole because, honestly; she shouldn't have had to deal with that situation to begin with.", "Guess you should have tried harder and made better plans. You weren\u2019t honest, you decided to criticise someone who did more than you ever did when you could have stepped up. Support really is t your thing though. YTA", "You could have tried harder.", "Should have tried harder, then!", "That uh\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make it better.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you try harder? You were cool with your teenage little sister taking that on?", "By what you have written you are 14 years older then her, you are telling me that at 29/30 you were still in graduate school? Sound more likely to me that you chose to care only about your life. You abandoned your younger sister to care for everything and have no right to tell her that she didn't do enough for her education, she did the best she could in that situation. YTA", "This is not the detail to clear your case.  You abandoned your underage siblings to have your own try at a perfect life while they suffered, sacrificing their education, childhood, and mental health.  You should be glad they even still talk to you, though they should really stop after an AH move this big.\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself for how you abandoned your family.  Grad school could have waited to help take care of the woman who wiped your own ass when you didn't have the capacity to.  You left that to two minors that took on far more than any children should EVER have to.  The fact that you don't even show an ounce of shame in your responses is condemning.  No shame, only excuses.\n\n**YTA**", "Why was a child doing this for years? Why were her adult siblings not taking care of this and of her?!", "Oh you\u2019re so right, that changes everything!\n\n/s\n\nYou focusing on the difference of a few years WHILE SHES STILL A MINOR shows your complete lack of accountability. YTA YTA YTA", "Wow, you literally ruined your sister's life and are now blaming her.  \n\nUnbelievable.", "WTF, you made a 15 year old do that, what kind of AH are you.", "+1 to that. The mid 20s guy couldn\u2019t manage to help out his ailing mom, but the 12yo should\u2019ve managed to study on top of being a caregiver? Wow.", "You should correct that to him being a crap human being.", "Even worse, he added that May was 15/16 meaning he was 29/30. In grad school and had no money.", "lol I already called him out on being a bad human in my other comment"]}
