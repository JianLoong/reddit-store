Why would they show up earlier, when they reasonably expect to be able to go right to their seat with no hassle? Moving around after the movie has started is rude and disruptive. And the way to prevent rude and disruptive is to sit in your assigned seat like a civilized person.\n\nFurthermore, in my town, seats have variable pricing depending on where the seat is.
