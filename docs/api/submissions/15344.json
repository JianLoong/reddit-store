Instead, you all decided to suffer together out of spite. Doing things for spite is asshole behaviour.", "ESH.", "You were the asshole first by insisting to stay in your seat,therefore, the family  became assholes. Honestly, I would have done the same.", "This is confusing to me, does all tickets not come with an assigned seat where you are? It has always been the norm where I live, so I was really confused why this family wouldn\u2019t already have their own assigned seats \n\nNTA. You paid for it, end of story.

The family should have moved. They didn't because the dad was a stubborn jerk. OP was just following the rules.\n\nLook, where I live, people don't show up until after the previews start. If you sit in someone else's assigned seat they have to sit in someone else's assigned seat, and it just causes a kerfuffle while everyone figures out where the original rule breaker was supposed to be. You don't KNOW that a seat is unoccupied until whoever bought it shows up or doesn't, so just sit in the seat you paid for. This is not hard.", "How is she the asshole by insisting on using the seat that she paid for?", "At movies, no, thats recent. But sporting events, concerts, theater tickets, yes.

Then Person B shows up, sees there is someone in their seat, decides not to make a big deal of it, and sits themself and their family in some other seats. Then persons F-J show up, expecting to sit together in the seats they bought, but random family is there because their seats were taken, and so they ask them to move, but they can't, so they have to go back to person A to straighten it out, and now the first 15 minutes of the movie is ruined by people whispering and getting up and down and using their phones to read each other's tickets.\n\nYou cannot count on a movie theater to be \"empty\" until *after the movie has started* because people with assigned seats show up at the last minute. Why would they show up earlier, when they reasonably expect to be able to go right to their seat with no hassle? Moving around after the movie has started is rude and disruptive. And the way to prevent rude and disruptive is to sit in your assigned seat like a civilized person.\n\nFurthermore, in my town, seats have variable pricing depending on where the seat is. If I pay an extra $3 for the seat in the center of the theater, I'm sitting in that seat, and you can take your butt to the cheap seat that you paid for.", "> If I pay an extra $3 for the seat in the center of the theater\n\nThen, go get a manager.

They obviously were in the completely wrong seats.\n\nThis is why I don't go to the theater anymore.

I've dealt with similar situations. Assholes like him are entitled. And they think because we're alone that means we should move over for groups or pairs. Nope. I once gave up a seat to assholes like them and I regret it. Never again.", "I would have called the manager from my seat and the whole thing would have ended with an usher moving the family to the seats they paid for. Its silly to go nuclear about little things. But, don't harass people who are just trying to be comfortable and get what they already paid for. I once had a very tall older gentleman ask me to switch seats with his, so he could be seated on the aisle. He needed the space to sprawl a bit because of his hip replacement and he hadn't been able to secure the seat I'd already purchased. He was very polite and very friendly, so I moved more than one seat so he and his wife could sit together. If you want a favor at least be considerate and polite to strangers. The dad was not polite.
