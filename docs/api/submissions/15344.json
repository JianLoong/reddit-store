Like I said earlier, I had chosen this showing for this seat rather than an earlier/later showing. Also- this could\u2019ve given them time to book these seats had they thought about it prior to 6pm. After his comment, I admit I became super stubborn and told him I wanted that seat as I had paid for it. So his son moves next to the dad. At this point there is a seat between mom and dad left open.

Assigned seating in theaters is nothing new. You should have gone to the theater manager and complained about him. My son is a manager at a theater and they LOVE being able to kindly tell people like this guy that they're out of line and they have the authority to escort him out if he continues to be disruptive. I'm amazed that your mom doesn't agree, but whatever. You were kinder and more tolerant than I would have been, trust me.", "NTA.\n\nYou bought the seat. If it was a priority to that dad to sit together, HE could have moved. But instead, it seems his bigger priority was to \"prove\" he was right by being an asshole.", "NTA.

He'll learn, or he'll eventually be obnoxious enough to get his ass booted from a showing he's paid for. When that happens, I hope his wife and kid enjoy the show. \n\nNTA, totally. And tell your mom times have changed.", "NTA. Most movie theaters have reserved seating now. So sit in your assigned seat and you won\u2019t have any problems. And book early if you want a specific seat. The fact that the theater was mostly empty is irrelevant. It\u2019s not that complicated!", "NTA. \n\nOne time I went on a date and he didn\u2019t want to sit in our assigned seats. He just kept moving and people kept telling us we were in their seats so we kept having to move. We hopped to *five* different seats before we finally found ones that weren\u2019t taken because the theater was full.

I thought this was going to veer into a family of 3 took your seats b/c they were split up and the entire thing was sold out.\n\nESH\n\nYou and that dad are stubbbbbornnn & petty to the point of your own detriment.  At least your wife and child weren't there to see you acting this way (but good on you for telling a bunch of people how you act). \n\nI like that part of a movie theater, also, but sitting one seat down or one row back will literally change NOTHING about the experience.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here if this happened.\n\nIf the theater was really that empty, you or the family could have moved one row backward or forward and been nearly in the same place.  Instead, you all decided to suffer together out of spite. Doing things for spite is asshole behaviour.", "ESH.", "You were the asshole first by insisting to stay in your seat,therefore, the family  became assholes. Honestly, I would have done the same.", "This is confusing to me, does all tickets not come with an assigned seat where you are? It has always been the norm where I live, so I was really confused why this family wouldn\u2019t already have their own assigned seats \n\nNTA. You paid for it, end of story. They can move and if they wanted to sit in a specific place they could have paid for it too.", "NTA, good for you for standing your ground. Or sitting it. You paid for the seat, no one had a right to it other than you.", "It would be easy to say you should have just moved--- but how would you know which seats hadn't already been sold?  What if you'd moved then been told by the rightful purchaser to move--then moved again and been asked to move again?    I don't understand the part where it sound like you offered to switch seats with the mom so they could sit together?", "Different generations.

I'm 53 and I was thrilled when assigned seating became widely used. It took 0.0 seconds for me to be accustomed to it.", "Oh my god I would have left after he said he didn\u2019t want to sit in the assigned seats", "Why should she sit one seat down when she paid for the seat she selected? The family should have moved. They didn't because the dad was a stubborn jerk. OP was just following the rules.\n\nLook, where I live, people don't show up until after the previews start. If you sit in someone else's assigned seat they have to sit in someone else's assigned seat, and it just causes a kerfuffle while everyone figures out where the original rule breaker was supposed to be. You don't KNOW that a seat is unoccupied until whoever bought it shows up or doesn't, so just sit in the seat you paid for. This is not hard.", "How is she the asshole by insisting on using the seat that she paid for?", "At movies, no, thats recent. But sporting events, concerts, theater tickets, yes. This has always been a thing. It's not some crazy new things millennials came up with.

It would be hard in the moment to just leave but I also would not be able to take the embarrassment of moving multiple times due to this weird desire of his.", "Do you live in the middle of nowhere, or do you just not know how assigned seats work?\n\nPerson A sits in the wrong seat. Then Person B shows up, sees there is someone in their seat, decides not to make a big deal of it, and sits themself and their family in some other seats. Then persons F-J show up, expecting to sit together in the seats they bought, but random family is there because their seats were taken, and so they ask them to move, but they can't, so they have to go back to person A to straighten it out, and now the first 15 minutes of the movie is ruined by people whispering and getting up and down and using their phones to read each other's tickets.\n\nYou cannot count on a movie theater to be \"empty\" until *after the movie has started* because people with assigned seats show up at the last minute. Why would they show up earlier, when they reasonably expect to be able to go right to their seat with no hassle? Moving around after the movie has started is rude and disruptive. And the way to prevent rude and disruptive is to sit in your assigned seat like a civilized person.\n\nFurthermore, in my town, seats have variable pricing depending on where the seat is. If I pay an extra $3 for the seat in the center of the theater, I'm sitting in that seat, and you can take your butt to the cheap seat that you paid for.", "> If I pay an extra $3 for the seat in the center of the theater\n\nThen, go get a manager. I go to the movies often, and I've never seen this. It would be a big difference if the theater is full, but since they are the literal only people there, they are both just being petty."]}
