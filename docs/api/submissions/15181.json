Her conduct was egregious. This is a comparatively lighter criticism of your conduct, but it\u2019s useful life skill to process (even very understandable) frustration and scorn for others in ways that don\u2019t involve name calling and other juvenile antics. The best way is often to express your emotions to others in your corner so that your feelings are validated without confrontation. Confronting someone like this has such a scant chance of actually correcting their character defects. The confrontation primarily is aimed at making yourself feel better. It often doesn\u2019t and creates needless risk of escalation.\n\nSometimes the urge to respond just can\u2019t be or shouldn\u2019t be ignored. There, it is still much better to use measured, non inflammatory language. I don\u2019t say this to moralize: it\u2019s often strategically better. Someone as awful as the other women almost surely feeds on conflict, like oxygen to a fire. By remaining in control of your emotions, you keep that power from them and prevent yourself from being seen as part of the problem.", "NTA but kind of cliche as an insult. You can do better. Just tell her to mind her own business.", "ESH - Asking people in an elevator to take the stairs is wrong under any circumstances other than the elevator being broken. Responding with name-calling is just as bad.  Sorry, just say \"We can't take the stairs, sorry\" and move on.", "ESH - who stops an elevator and tells others to take the stairs? Rude", "NTA quite obviously but I think you should have used some more creativity.", "ESH\n\nYou're 38 years old and you still feed the need to call people names?\n\nYes, she shouldn't have told you to use the stairs, but I'm sure pointing out that *your father is in a freaking wheelchair* was embarrassing enough to her, without having to resort to name-calling. \n\nRegarding the \"valid reason,\" some buildings have a \"one up, two down\" policy in which if you only have to go up one floor or down one or two, you're supposed to use the stairs, not the elevator (it's *completely* voluntary, not anything that would be enforced by management). I expect she was attempting to enforce such a policy, or implement it on her own.", "NTA \n\nShe should have minded her own business.", "ESH. She was rude, you were rude back!", "ESH (or maybe ETK?)\n\nHer for asking you to take the stairs while your dad is in a wheelchair.\n\nYou for insulting her back.\n\nTwo wrongs don't make a right, you know?", "I mean, I dont think you're an AH per se considering she was well out of line but you do need to grow up. Saying \"mind your own business\" would have made a lot more sense. Equally I see in the comments you are trying to claim you were actually being nice by telling her to have a nice day... come off it, you are 38 say what you mean and move on.", "NTA. Never assume you know why someone is taking the elevator ESPECIALLY in a freaking doctors office. Most people are there because they\u2019re sick or injured or in pain of some sort probably not taking the elevator because they\u2019re lazy. She should have kept her mouth shut.", "YTA neither of you knew the others' situation but all she did was make a request. You escalated the conversation by calling her that name.", "YTA. How embarrassing to act like this and then come to the internet to ask if your behavior is ok. You\u2019re an adult who wants permission to get angry and call people childish names over a misunderstanding. Obviously no one would ask a person in a wheel chair to be rolled up the stairs. Stop it.", "NTA - I don\u2019t know what that woman\u2019s deal was but I think it\u2019s appropriate for people to face light consequences for this type of behavior. She likely just operates in this fashion with little pushback and she may think twice next time. Also, this is particularly egregious in a medical setting. Even if your dad wasn\u2019t in a wheelchair, there is a much higher chance that someone has an invisible disability or is just sick and exhausted and doesn\u2019t want to take the stairs.", "YTA.  Not sure why you felt the need to escalate.  It's not like she tried to push the matter.", "YTA - name calling will always make you an AH, sure shouldn't have interjected at all mind.", "YTA. You had not enough information and jumped to namecalling without any provocation. Did it make you feel somehow superior?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I always take the elevator down, and try to walk up.\n\nBecause going down stresses your knees and has no other benefit.\n\nWalking up 6 or 8 flights of stairs is a marvelous cardiovascular workout, and good for you knees.", "Gonna go out in a limb and assume a doctors office doesn\u2019t have a one up/one down policy.", "Never heard of that before, good to know.", "Telling complete strangers to take the stairs instead of the elevator is an asshole move, even if she didn't notice the wheelchair.
