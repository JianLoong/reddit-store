I would ask prosecutor for a suspended sentence on stipulation K keeps her nose clean (conviction could then be vacated after certain  amount of time). I really hope this is an option where you are, cause it sounds like K (and mother) have no remorse here, and would suck for any young persons childish actions to follow them for life. That said, you did nothing wrong, and are being truthful, and are not in position to eat this debt.

And if you take the payment plan you're not only never going to get the money, she doesn't even work, but your debt is going to snowball with interest. The prosecutor was a naive fool, who also surely does not know the history here and how atrocious this person's behavior was towards you and your son.\n\nShe's young, chances are they will be very lenient with her when it comes to sentencing.

This isn't some classic small mistake everyone makes as a young adult that you learn and grow from. This was a calculated detrimental CRIME. This has escalated to the point of it being a felony, that is extremely serious. She needs to be held accountable for her actions. Causing that much damage to you and your finances, not to mention the emotional distress you must be dealing with as well, is something she absolutely cannot get away with. If she gets let off the hook she'll never pay you back that large amount of money and she'll most likely go on to do the same thing again to someone else. She's clearly been being enabled and it's time for her to grow up and face the consequences of her actions.", "NTA.  She ruined her own life by being a thief.

I\u2019ve been following this saga since you first posted and these lowlife women have tried to ruin your life repeatedly. And your son\u2019s life. She ABSOLUTELY deserves a felony conviction.

She stole your identity and racked up a ridiculous amount of debt that you would be responsible for if you do not press charges. She doesn't have a job. She cannot and (I'm pretty sure by your description of her) will not pay you back. She deserves the felony that is coming her way.", "NTA. If her mother keeps bailing her out, she will be facing many more charges as she gets older. Nobody is doing her any favors by not making her face the consequences for her actions.

It's easier than getting the only kind of job open to 19 year olds (entry-level retail, food service, etc.) and putting in the hard, slogging work necessary to actually EARN the money to buy what she wants! \n\nShe didn't care what her thieving did to your life or your son's. She thought only about herself! Perhaps a stint in prison will give her time to reflect on what she - an ADULT, not a li'l kiddie! - is doing with her life. Because I very much doubt that anything short of that will make an impact on this incredibly selfish twit.", "fuck that.

She shouldn't even have to be told thats a crime, it should be common sense. 19 is young too, even after she serves whatever punishment is dished out to her she'll be able to save herself one day if she works at it. Won't be easy for her but she and the people defending her are literally destroying your life. She has to learn from that! \n\nI also dont think your attorney had a right to say anything. Obviously you wouldn't have hired him if you weren't wanting to do anything about it. Her age does not excuse her behavior in this situation.

Her actions and lack of contrition are what's going to make her life more difficult BUT she is 19 - she has plenty of time to grow up and be a better person.", "NTA.  If the ex pays off everything in full, including the previous amount,  then drop the  charges....when you are  made whole, or if the credit cards transfer the debt to your ex, but if you  are on the  hook, it's a tough lesson.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s time they learned that every one of their actions has consequences.", "NTA!! Please don\u2019t let this person intimidate you. Talk to someone else, file a complaint on this prosecutor. The way your ex and her daughter acted was horrible, they do not regret anything and are awful humans.", "Has either individual reached out recently to offer an official repayment plan? And sincere apologies?  Then consider your options. If not\u2026\n\nThen carry on. Crimes have been committed. Protect yourself and others", "NTA", "NTA and let us know how it goes!", "The prosecutor probably just wants to avoid the paperwork and the effort on what he considers small potatoes. He needs to put on his big boy pants and do his fucking job because what is a molehill to him had turned into fucking Everest for you.\n\nI've been following your story since the beginning, and with every update I get more and more pissed off. Though I know this is the internet and I only have half the story, you and your kid seem like genuinely good people, and all you've ever done is try to provide for him.\n\nYou tried to find a civil solution. Ex and K not only refused, but they lied and K proceeded to take MORE from you. K ***IS*** a criminal. You are not ruining K's life, K is finally facing real consequences for her actions.\n\nNTA", "Karma really does work its way back around. NTA", "What she had done can do extreme damage to your life. So NTA.", "NTA. The prosecutor is TA for trying to talk you out of it. She and her Mom belong in jail.", "Definitely NTA. Get a different prosecutor", "NTA. Go through with it; K needs to learn a hard lesson now when she is young and can learn from the consequences of her actions. If not, it will be even worse for her when she gets older and does this with even bigger amounts of money at her job or something.  \n\n\nThe prosecutor is out of place to be telling yout his, but I can see where he is coming from even though he is completely off the mark. He probably figures she is practically still a child with her whole life ahead of her and a lot of promise that will be forever ruined if she is a convicted felon. To him, it's not like she is Bernie Madoff, Charles Keating, or Jordan Belfort... the girl's age and the amount she stole is not worth ruining her life over.", "Technically no, but\u2026", "NTA. Press the charges. Her mom clearly enabled the behavior. They both need to realize that actions have consequences.", "Absolutely nothing!", "> How did K get this information?\n\nI always left my wallet on top of the fridge. Stupid on my part but wasn't a invitation for her to steal.", "> an obvious victim\n\nI swear people in my life do not see this & think the same for my son.", "Re prosecutors request u drop the charges:  so they want you to pay out of your pocket for the money that was stolen from you.  That is beyond ridiculous and it\u2019s punishing the victim!  Tell prosecutor to get off their backside and do his/her job.", "Yep. The crimes have occurred. All that\u2019s missing are the convictions.", "Ok, right! So this IS the same saga where the SD bought the expensive makeup after stealing the son\u2019s money that he saved for a bereaved friend? It looked so familiar. \n\nTotally agree with the commenter\u2019s position. OP, you\u2019ve gone above and beyond already. Let the chips fall where the SD and her mom cast them. \n\nNTA", "Oh my god I hate that I had the EXACT SAME thought.\n\nNTA in any universe.", "Same I really hope she gets what she earned."]}
