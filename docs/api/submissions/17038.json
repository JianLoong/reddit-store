His mother is now struggling, that\u2019s a reality worth sympathy, but it\u2019s not something for a child who has suffered from her parental neglect to resolve. She failed him as a parent and he\u2019s busy trying to mentally and emotionally deal with that, telling him to \u201clook at things from her perspective\u201d is incredibly dismissive of his reality.\n\nRight now the only thing on offer for OP in this relationship is unpaid labour.

BUT: if a casual acquaintance asked me to help out with a child who was dealing with a parent with cancer, I can't imagine saying no.

Your mom put herself first all those years, it's time you do the same to her so she can maybe see what that did to you.  But don't take it out on the kid; it's not her fault.  None of this is.  Seems like she's as much a victim in this as you are.  I've had a stepdad.  He and I got along pretty well.  I learned a lot from him.  He helped raise me and he was as much a dad to me as my bio father.  But the one constant in that household was that Mom put the kids first.  (Me and two sisters).  They dated for almost a year before we even met him.

Pretty sure you aren't either. But babysitting a 7 year old is easy - hand them a device and then play on yours. Done. Heck, you could probably have your friends over and no one would care.

Very soft. I'd have done it, not for your mum, but for April. She's a 7 year old who is about to lose her father. I'd see it as an opportunity to be her big sister sort of and be there for her for if she needed someone to talk to about her feelings. It's hard being a kid dealing with such a close death at a young age. I can see you've been terribly damaged by the way your mum treated you all, but I'd have done it for the innocent child in all this.", "NTA she has alienated a great many people in her life and this is the result as none of your siblings want to help her. you are not along because your siblings are doing the same thing.", "I can\u2019t stand parents like these.\n\nShe wants to fool around. That\u2019s fine, people can fool around and their relationship is their own business. We are no one to police that.\n\nHowever, this changes once someone has children that they are responsible for. Mom can no longer fool around and move in with her next fling and try to mingle two families in such short notice\u2026 she\u2019s playing Happy Boyfriend and Happy Family but this is not a game. Fooling around days are over once she was responsible for raising her children.\n\nNo wonder OP and siblings wanted to stay with dad. They need a rock in their life. I\u2019m sorry to hear that only one parent could step up to the task.", "I have never seen any family of April's around other than Joe. He's estranged from his parents and has no siblings, I think. No sign of any maternal family either.", "How is my dad an AH? He has nothing to do with her?? He's not her family, he's never even met her.", "I'm not perfect but if I had a kid or kids, I would do my very best to give them stability and I wouldn't bring random people in and out of their lives the way she did to us.", "Lol, I can never get enough of the sheer audacity some of you have.", "My mom gave me no stability when I was a kid. She was moving around, bringing random guys and random kids into my life all the time. That's pretty wrong in my eyes.", "NTA I think the mom burned the bridge with the kids by moving them around and prioritizing her wants over their needs. When you do this there comes a time no matter who your are people are done with you.\n\nIt\u2019s not op\u2019s responsibility to pick up the slack here. I think op and his siblings suffered a lot at moms hand. They don\u2019t owe her anything.", "You do it then.", "Sounds like mom's problem.

It also sounds like April will be having a hard time, she may be about to lose her father and with the only parental figure left being your mother you understand the position she may be in.\n\nSometimes life is not fair but sometimes you have to treat life better than it has treated you. It sounds like April might really need a big brother here, it doesn't have to be you but her life and world would get a lot better if it was you.  \n\n\nI think you'd be fully justified in saying no, but I also think you have opportunity to be very kind to a kid who really needs it, and it would be remembered.", "Ignore it. Some commenters on here lack reading comprehension and some think that women can do no wrong.", "None of you are THE A H. However I think this is a good opportunity to show some compassion. Pass along a little good in the world. Even if your mom doesn't expressly deserve it. There is a child and cancer and it wouldn't be hard to set boundaries on how often you watch the kid. It's up to you.", "Your dad isn\u2019t the AH. It\u2019s unfortunate what is going on with Joe, but that\u2019s not your dads problem.", "He doesn\u2019t live with the mom. Why should he help her. She ruined his and his siblings childhood. \n\nMom lost all rights to ask her children to help. Being alone and your children not wanting to be around you is an consequence to her actions.", "Yeah, I was amazed by the audacity your mother showed by asking her ex-husband to babysit her stepdaughter.", "I get that. I don't think it's in me to be her big brother. I have zero interest in the kid.
