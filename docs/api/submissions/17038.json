My mom is looking after April and is struggling to juggle everything. She asked my dad if he could watch April after school for her and he said no. She asked my siblings and they said no.

She considers April mine and my siblings little sister while we never saw April as a sibling. She's just Joe's kid. Joe's just Joe or mom's husband. We're not close to them. We're also not very close to mom. Mom told me she needs someone and I am the only one left who can realistically do it. I told her I won't babysit and that's final.

Yes, you aren\u2019t obligated to help your mom, but April is a bigger victim in all of this. Her Dad is sick.

Between you 4 your Mom, maybe pay for a proper babysitter? I'm not saying you have to.
