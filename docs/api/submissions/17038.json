She brings it up again, then you state calmly but firmly that \u201cmy answer is no, that\u2019s final, and I\u2019m not going to discuss it anymore.\u201d  And then refuse any other discussion on that topic, period.

You\u2019re just the last of the easier options, and the others take more effort, which she\u2019s trying to avoid.  Like her step child has a whole other side of her family (mom and mom\u2019s side), one that presumably actually knows her.  She should be pressing *them* to help out.

Just cuz she wanted to have another kid doesn\u2019t mean you are responsible at all for the child nor obligated to do anything for them. Parents do this mind rot tactic that they expect something done because they birthed you, very strange concept. I have a similar issue but not that similar, my dads gf makes arrangements for my sister and I to come over and hangout when we don\u2019t want to be associated with them, I\u2019m 23 my sis is 26, and we were verbally and mentally abused at a young age by parents. Here\u2019s the lesson I learned, you owe nobody anything."]}
