He doesn\u2019t work (rich dad), just sleeps until 3-4pm and plays video games all night after I go to bed. My work is a 20-25 minute drive, mostly highway. We have an agreement that he picks me up from work on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. I take the bus every morning and I bus home on Tuesdays and Thursdays. When I bus home he has dinner ready for me (just something frozen cooked in the oven). It\u2019s 3 different bus lines, takes about 90 minutes. Uber/cab is between $40 and $60.\n\nI\u2019m not allowed my phone while I\u2019m at work, so I get off at 5:30 to a bunch of texts from him about how Maps is estimating 51 mins for him to get to me and how awful it is out there so he isn\u2019t going to come. I was annoyed, but semi-understanding. He seemed apologetic and kept saying \u201cI hope you don\u2019t hate me\u201d.\n\nI stood in blizzard conditions from 5:45 until 6:20 waiting for my first bus (scheduled to be there at 5:58).

For my last connection I was in the cold from 7:20 to 8:00. I didn\u2019t get home until 8:30. I ran myself a bubble bath, ate leftover pasta while in the bath and then went to bed.

The extra detail about how he spends his time is extraneous to the story but very telling that you included it.  Your boyfriend has a much easier life than you and in your position I would resent the heck out of that too.

It sucks that you had to take the bus, but demanding that someone to come get you in dangerous driving conditions is not okay.  Getting big mad about it it, and staying mad, is a little ridiculous.

Why would you expect him to drive in that? I\u2019d be more mad if my partner put their life on the line to pick me up in that kind of storm.", "YTA. You expected him to go out in dangerous conditions to pick you up. It was safer for him not to go out and it was probably advised not to.

In those conditions, one should only drive if it\u2019s an emergency. This wasn\u2019t an emergency and you had another way to get home. He made the right call.

However, it\u2019s the reality of what it\u2019s like for those of us who don\u2019t drive. I remember standing in one spot at a bus stop for at least 40 minutes while the snow under my feet melted. Fun times. Kinda think ESH because you\u2019re mad at someone who actually isn\u2019t obligated to give you rides. But your work is also to blame because there\u2019s no way they weren\u2019t aware of the conditions and should have let employees access their phones, I feel they put all of you at risk and lastly your boyfriend, who while he\u2019s not obligated to give the ride, his concern should have set him on the road to get you early in the storm, when it was obvious conditions were going bad, fast. My husband would absolutely been outside in our car, waiting for me.", "I don\u2019t understand the verdict of people saying boyfriend is TA. If you\u2019re in blizzard conditions, why are you expecting someone to drive in it? It\u2019s dangerous for cars to be on the road, and as a non driver, I doubt you understand how down right frightening driving in weather like that can be. Ultimately you had a way home - the bus. Also - if you know the weather is that shite, why are you not dressed appropriately for it? If it\u2019s blizzard condition, dress appropriately instead of whinging about wearing clothes that get wet from snow. \n\nYou need to realise it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s responsibility to get you to and from work when you have alternate means.

It's scary to drive in a severe snow storm. \n\nHowever, if the boyfriend was too scared to go pick up his girlfriend, he should have paid for an uber- instead of making her spend 3 hours freezing in the snow. An Uber is a professional driver, likely would have been someone's with a larger vehicle and good traction as they choose when they're going to drive. \n\nEveryone saying the girlfriend should have prepared- SHE HAD NO ACCESS TO HER PHONE. \n\nThe boyfriend knew the storm was severe, had access to weather updates the entire time. HE should have figured out a safer and easier alternative to get her home and texted it to her. He was already responsible to be her ride home, he should have found a safer alternative for her to get home. Even without him making the commitment to pick her up- a decent, loving and protecting boyfriend would not want his girlfriend stuck out in a snow storm. \n\nSo this is why I say it's the question of who's life does he value most? Does he value his own safety over his girlfriend? Or does he value his girlfriend enough to ensure she is safe and protected? \n\nOp, I'm sorry that you went through this. My boyfriend would never leave me out in a snowstorm for HOURS, trying to find my way home. If he couldn't take on the snowstorm himself to pick me up, he would have found someone who could.

The roads were bad. He still should have picked you up. \n\nHe made a promise. He broke it. Sometimes there\u2019s extenuating circumstances outside of people\u2019s control that causes promises to be impossible to fulfill, but this isn\u2019t one of them for the following reasons.\n\nHe\u2019s not adding unnecessary traffic to the road (if he was running to the store for some chips then that\u2019s unnecessary traffic and endangering others).

While he's home, does he do the chores? Wash dishes? Laundry? Clean house? You say he cooks frozen meals for you, but even that I could see being frustrating when he has the time to learn how to cook but he puts no effort in to do something nice for you. \n\nEven if he didn't pick you up, he still could have done something nice for you. When you walked in the door, did he say anything beyond \"Hey\"? Did he tell you to sit down while he ran you a bath? Did he offer to reheat the pasta and bring it to you? Make sure the bed was made and was nice and warm for you? Offered to do your soaking wet laundry? Rub your probably freezing feet?

Schools were not cancelled, almost all businesses were still open, and I even remember bussing/walking to school in that blizzard. The plows were struggling to keep up with the snowfall, but all the city did was announce that there would be forgiveness on bylaw tickets if you get one for failing to remove the snow from your sidewalk during the blizzard. They also asked anyone with a personal or company owned plow to contact the city if they were willing to take on a couple of the city routes to help with the massive amounts of snow. The city sent out some extra busses for school routes to try and keep the kids safe, but that was the best they could really do.\n\nYou learn to drive in these conditions because driving is legitimately safer than trying to catch a bus that can\u2019t even guarantee that it\u2019ll run anywhere near on time.

Even if this is the first time, it won't be the last.

You get home to a hot meal and warm pajamas he has laid out for you, you hug, you bitch about the storm, you hang out and relax. He offers to take you to work tomorrow since he couldn't pick you up today, your annoyance melts away because he shows he cares. \n\nSo now, you talk to him if you can't shake this feelings- I get that you couldn't get me in the storm, but when you can't do things I depend on you for, a kind gesture would be greatly appreciated. It's like if someone has to cancel plans for a very legit reason (flat tire, work emergency) the nice thing for the person cancelling to do is to actively plan a new activity or nice thing to make up for the cancellation.
