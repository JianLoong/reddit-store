He doesn\u2019t work (rich dad), just sleeps until 3-4pm and plays video games all night after I go to bed. My work is a 20-25 minute drive, mostly highway. We have an agreement that he picks me up from work on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. I take the bus every morning and I bus home on Tuesdays and Thursdays. When I bus home he has dinner ready for me (just something frozen cooked in the oven). It\u2019s 3 different bus lines, takes about 90 minutes. Uber/cab is between $40 and $60.\n\nI\u2019m not allowed my phone while I\u2019m at work, so I get off at 5:30 to a bunch of texts from him about how Maps is estimating 51 mins for him to get to me and how awful it is out there so he isn\u2019t going to come. I was annoyed, but semi-understanding. He seemed apologetic and kept saying \u201cI hope you don\u2019t hate me\u201d.\n\nI stood in blizzard conditions from 5:45 until 6:20 waiting for my first bus (scheduled to be there at 5:58).

For my last connection I was in the cold from 7:20 to 8:00. I didn\u2019t get home until 8:30. I ran myself a bubble bath, ate leftover pasta while in the bath and then went to bed.

The extra detail about how he spends his time is extraneous to the story but very telling that you included it.  Your boyfriend has a much easier life than you and in your position I would resent the heck out of that too.

It sucks that you had to take the bus, but demanding that someone to come get you in dangerous driving conditions is not okay.  Getting big mad about it it, and staying mad, is a little ridiculous.

Why would you expect him to drive in that? I\u2019d be more mad if my partner put their life on the line to pick me up in that kind of storm.", "YTA. You expected him to go out in dangerous conditions to pick you up. It was safer for him not to go out and it was probably advised not to.

In those conditions, one should only drive if it\u2019s an emergency. This wasn\u2019t an emergency and you had another way to get home. He made the right call.

However, it\u2019s the reality of what it\u2019s like for those of us who don\u2019t drive. I remember standing in one spot at a bus stop for at least 40 minutes while the snow under my feet melted. Fun times. Kinda think ESH because you\u2019re mad at someone who actually isn\u2019t obligated to give you rides. But your work is also to blame because there\u2019s no way they weren\u2019t aware of the conditions and should have let employees access their phones, I feel they put all of you at risk and lastly your boyfriend, who while he\u2019s not obligated to give the ride, his concern should have set him on the road to get you early in the storm, when it was obvious conditions were going bad, fast. My husband would absolutely been outside in our car, waiting for me.", "I don\u2019t understand the verdict of people saying boyfriend is TA. If you\u2019re in blizzard conditions, why are you expecting someone to drive in it? It\u2019s dangerous for cars to be on the road, and as a non driver, I doubt you understand how down right frightening driving in weather like that can be. Ultimately you had a way home - the bus. Also - if you know the weather is that shite, why are you not dressed appropriately for it? If it\u2019s blizzard condition, dress appropriately instead of whinging about wearing clothes that get wet from snow. \n\nYou need to realise it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s responsibility to get you to and from work when you have alternate means.

He didn\u2019t predict that it\u2019ll take you 2 hrs to get home, or that you\u2019ll be soaking wet when you got back home.  Sure, it would\u2019ve been nice if he came and got you.

You really expected him to drive in that? \n\nI dont doubt that waiting in the snow sucked, but no need to take it out on him", "YTA. If you know a storm is coming, then pack appropriate clothing and check your phone to ensure that your ride is still able to come get you.

It's scary to drive in a severe snow storm. \n\nHowever, if the boyfriend was too scared to go pick up his girlfriend, he should have paid for an uber- instead of making her spend 3 hours freezing in the snow. An Uber is a professional driver, likely would have been someone's with a larger vehicle and good traction as they choose when they're going to drive. \n\nEveryone saying the girlfriend should have prepared- SHE HAD NO ACCESS TO HER PHONE. \n\nThe boyfriend knew the storm was severe, had access to weather updates the entire time. HE should have figured out a safer and easier alternative to get her home and texted it to her. He was already responsible to be her ride home, he should have found a safer alternative for her to get home. Even without him making the commitment to pick her up- a decent, loving and protecting boyfriend would not want his girlfriend stuck out in a snow storm. \n\nSo this is why I say it's the question of who's life does he value most? Does he value his own safety over his girlfriend? Or does he value his girlfriend enough to ensure she is safe and protected? \n\nOp, I'm sorry that you went through this. My boyfriend would never leave me out in a snowstorm for HOURS, trying to find my way home. If he couldn't take on the snowstorm himself to pick me up, he would have found someone who could.

The roads were bad. He still should have picked you up. \n\nHe made a promise. He broke it. Sometimes there\u2019s extenuating circumstances outside of people\u2019s control that causes promises to be impossible to fulfill, but this isn\u2019t one of them for the following reasons.\n\nHe\u2019s not adding unnecessary traffic to the road (if he was running to the store for some chips then that\u2019s unnecessary traffic and endangering others). In this case he was picking someone up who was stranded in the storm! That is a valid and necessary reason to be out in the weather.\n\nPublic transit was running.

But he is not the asshole for refusing to drive in it and you are not the asshole for feeling miserable after you had an awful time getting home.\n\nI think the issue here is that is that you don't feel valued by your partner and may even resent him for his lack of work ethic. While he's home, does he do the chores? Wash dishes? Laundry? Clean house? You say he cooks frozen meals for you, but even that I could see being frustrating when he has the time to learn how to cook but he puts no effort in to do something nice for you. \n\nEven if he didn't pick you up, he still could have done something nice for you. When you walked in the door, did he say anything beyond \"Hey\"? Did he tell you to sit down while he ran you a bath? Did he offer to reheat the pasta and bring it to you? Make sure the bed was made and was nice and warm for you? Offered to do your soaking wet laundry? Rub your probably freezing feet?

He thought, as you seem to have, at the time you got out of work that your regular bus route would be more efficient. You were both wrong. \n\nYou\u2019re now angry because he didn\u2019t make the choice to risk the elements to come to get you when arguably the public transportation option was the safest option. \n\nYou need to have a conversation about the effort he puts towards your relationship.

What would of she done?", "Tbh I feel like most of these commenters don\u2019t live in snowy environments and don\u2019t realize what our drivers go through every single winter. When you live somewhere that gets these extreme snow storms, you learn to drive in them until the roads are shut down because until the roads are shut down no businesses shut down. And the busses stop running before the roads are shut down because they expect you to find a ride in smaller vehicles (taxi, family, your own vehicle, etc) if you need to go out. It\u2019s also 10x more dangerous to be outside in those storms than it is to drive in them (yes, even if you\u2019re dressed appropriately. If you fall on the ice and hit your head, you get covered in snow so fast that no one will even realize you\u2019re there until you\u2019ve frozen to death. Standing outside is extreme frostbite risks. And in many places petty street crime ticks up in those conditions because low visibility means you\u2019re less likely to be helped by passing people strangers).\n\nIf he didn\u2019t feel safe driving in those conditions, he honestly should have at least offered to split the cost of her getting a cab or Uber because he had made the commitment to pick her up already. Also, in these snowy environments most loving partners actually realize being outside is much more dangerous than driving in those conditions and actually give a shit about their partner freezing to death while they wait for a bus that might not even show up\u2026\u2026\u2026..", "And how exactly that applies to OP's situation in which her bf is supposed to pick her up from work regularly?", "Because I'm in a state that gets a lot of snow, and everyone has tires that handle snow.", "Also, even if the bus somehow crash(unlikely) youre way safer in the bus than in a car", "While I haven\u2019t driven a bus I\u2019ve driven fire engines and have to imagine with a bus being similar sized but lighter (never driven with an empty water tank) but I figure it\u2019s not gonna handle near as well as a car.

Hopefully not too badly, but it doesn\u2019t take much dampness to be absolutely frigid when you get back out. \nTotally valid on the bus stops depending on the set up if it had a canopy or not etc could be better or worse. It sounds like no cover at least, and idk how much space off the street she may have had.

Yet, I don't have cable.", "> And the busses stop running before the roads are shut down\n\nIf the buses were still running, OP must have been exaggerating about the conditions.", "Boston has gotten 7 inches of snow so far this season. It\u2019s not Canada. No one gets snow tires there.", "I am also in a state that gets lots of snow, and so many people do not have tires that can handle snow. Just because it's true for your personal experience, doesn't mean it's true for everyone else.", "How do you figure? You have no seat belts no airbags. What at all makes a crash in a bus safer than in a car?", "In what world do you just go, \"ho hum, gigantic snowstorm out there, this is totally business as usual no need to confirm how or even if I'm getting home\"? And yes, I've lived in that same area in the past, I'm familiar with commuting in the snow.", "Not necessarily. I live in Canada. The record breaking blizzard my city had in my lifetime was -48C (before the windchill) and next to no visibility. You could see maybe 5-10 feet in front of you. People were having to shovel their walkways two to three times an hour to keep their houses accessible. Schools were not cancelled, almost all businesses were still open, and I even remember bussing/walking to school in that blizzard. The plows were struggling to keep up with the snowfall, but all the city did was announce that there would be forgiveness on bylaw tickets if you get one for failing to remove the snow from your sidewalk during the blizzard. They also asked anyone with a personal or company owned plow to contact the city if they were willing to take on a couple of the city routes to help with the massive amounts of snow. The city sent out some extra busses for school routes to try and keep the kids safe, but that was the best they could really do.\n\nYou learn to drive in these conditions because driving is legitimately safer than trying to catch a bus that can\u2019t even guarantee that it\u2019ll run anywhere near on time. And sadly our economies can\u2019t afford to shut down due to these snowstorms, so you\u2019re expected to keep working/going to school/whatever even when the whiteouts hit.", "Ever heard of Minnesota?"]}
