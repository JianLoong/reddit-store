Near zero visibility, plows couldn\u2019t get roads cleared fast enough, 20 minute commutes were taking over an hour. \n\nI don\u2019t drive, my bf does. We live together. He doesn\u2019t work (rich dad), just sleeps until 3-4pm and plays video games all night after I go to bed. My work is a 20-25 minute drive, mostly highway. We have an agreement that he picks me up from work on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. I take the bus every morning and I bus home on Tuesdays and Thursdays. When I bus home he has dinner ready for me (just something frozen cooked in the oven). It\u2019s 3 different bus lines, takes about 90 minutes. Uber/cab is between $40 and $60.\n\nI\u2019m not allowed my phone while I\u2019m at work, so I get off at 5:30 to a bunch of texts from him about how Maps is estimating 51 mins for him to get to me and how awful it is out there so he isn\u2019t going to come. I was annoyed, but semi-understanding. He seemed apologetic and kept saying \u201cI hope you don\u2019t hate me\u201d.\n\nI stood in blizzard conditions from 5:45 until 6:20 waiting for my first bus (scheduled to be there at 5:58). My legs were numb and covered in ice pellets (which then melted on the heated bus and made me soaking wet). With each connection I grew more and more irritated until I was nothing short of livid. For my last connection I was in the cold from 7:20 to 8:00. I didn\u2019t get home until 8:30. I ran myself a bubble bath, ate leftover pasta while in the bath and then went to bed. It took everything in me to not lose my shit on him for leaving me to commute in a storm.

The extra detail about how he spends his time is extraneous to the story but very telling that you included it.  Your boyfriend has a much easier life than you and in your position I would resent the heck out of that too.

It sucks that you had to take the bus, but demanding that someone to come get you in dangerous driving conditions is not okay.  Getting big mad about it it, and staying mad, is a little ridiculous.

Why would you expect him to drive in that? I\u2019d be more mad if my partner put their life on the line to pick me up in that kind of storm.", "YTA. You expected him to go out in dangerous conditions to pick you up. It was safer for him not to go out and it was probably advised not to. However, I think the real issue is that he gets to sit around and play games all day while you are out working. This is causing resentment.

In those conditions, one should only drive if it\u2019s an emergency. This wasn\u2019t an emergency and you had another way to get home. He made the right call.

In a snowstorm, drivers should stay off the road! \n\nIt\u2019s not his fault that you work a job that makes you come in during dangerous weather and doesn\u2019t let you communicate with loved ones even in a weather emergency. It\u2019s also not his fault that you don\u2019t drive. Rethink your working situation and find something better and closer to home. \n\nAlso, you seem to have some resentment toward your boyfriend for not working.

However, it\u2019s the reality of what it\u2019s like for those of us who don\u2019t drive. I remember standing in one spot at a bus stop for at least 40 minutes while the snow under my feet melted. Fun times. Kinda think ESH because you\u2019re mad at someone who actually isn\u2019t obligated to give you rides. But your work is also to blame because there\u2019s no way they weren\u2019t aware of the conditions and should have let employees access their phones, I feel they put all of you at risk and lastly your boyfriend, who while he\u2019s not obligated to give the ride, his concern should have set him on the road to get you early in the storm, when it was obvious conditions were going bad, fast. My husband would absolutely been outside in our car, waiting for me.", "I don\u2019t understand the verdict of people saying boyfriend is TA. If you\u2019re in blizzard conditions, why are you expecting someone to drive in it? It\u2019s dangerous for cars to be on the road, and as a non driver, I doubt you understand how down right frightening driving in weather like that can be. Ultimately you had a way home - the bus. Also - if you know the weather is that shite, why are you not dressed appropriately for it? If it\u2019s blizzard condition, dress appropriately instead of whinging about wearing clothes that get wet from snow. \n\nYou need to realise it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s responsibility to get you to and from work when you have alternate means.

And, had you had some ability to know and prepare and make contingency plans and at least know what you were getting into, or to have him meet you halfway through the commute, or SOMETHING, you could have mitigated the situation.\n\nA blizzard isn't his fault.

My dad was *very* reluctant because of the weather, we were getting a ton of wet snow which made it hard to see and had left a bunch of black ice on the roads.\n\nStill, my brother insisted that my dad pick him up, he even started laying on the guilt, saying it was it was unfair that he'd have to walk in a storm when my dad could easily pick him up and be back at the house in 5 minutes.\n\nMy dad only ever made it around the corner before he was hit by a city bus sliding on a massive ice patch. The accident *literally* split the car in two, hitting it right down the centre. I don't know how, but my dad walk away unscathed. He kept finding large shards of metal and glass in his jacket for days but somehow didn't have a scratch on him.\n\nMy Brother got home before my dad did, who, at this point, was having to deal with the car and a file police report for insurance purposes. He had no idea that my dad was fine. He did, however, see our wrecked sardine can of a car from the bus window. He immediately went into a panic and started crying, thinking he'd killed our father. Long story short, he never once asked or expected my dad to ever drive again if the weather wasn't amenable to it.\n\nSo yeah, I'm leaning towards YTA.
