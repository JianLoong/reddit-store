Why are you with a Man who is showing that he doesn't care for his own kids? On that count, you are the AH as the dude is showing you who he is?  The fact that his daughter was cut until and that he didn't even know until it was infected, shows just how little interest he has in his kids!\n\nThe fact that you say that he doesn't want custody of his own kids speaks volumes. What's even more shocking is your sugesstion of the grandparents taking over? You are aware the grandparents are no longer young right? What was easy for them 10 years ago is no longer due to age? The child is the responsibility of the parents, not grandparents. \n\n My view, don't have kids with this guy until you see how he treats his 1st set of kids. That will be your indicator of how he treats kids and how he will treat yours if you choose to have kids with him. Again your choice.
