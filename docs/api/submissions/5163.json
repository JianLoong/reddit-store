We don't \"teach kids\" what straight is, they just see it in life. Same as gay, at least, ideally. It's just a part of life & not in anyway wrong.

She is going to meet plenty of gay folks in her life and her parents can't control that.

It\u2019s not up to parents to let their kids know gay people exist, they can explain what \u2018gay\u2019 is but if they haven\u2019t done that by age 7 then they\u2019ve already failed.

Hiding other races because they haven\u2019t told them other skin colours exist? No. They need to recognise their own failure to educate their child here. \n\nIt\u2019s not a big deal to say \u201csome men love men, some women love women\u201d, most kids just go \u201coh, ok!\u201d and return to whatever they were doing before.

NTA", "Irish Catholic here.\n\nNo your sister in law is homophobic.\n\nHello, had she been to Ireland recently? \nI am not saying that homophones does not exist but using \"religion\" as an excuse is a load of bull and not tolerated.\n\n\nMost kids that age accept. Only ahole parents teach them different \n\nNta", "NTA and holy shit the same thing happened to me years ago lmao. My (at the time) 7 y/o cousin asked about me having a bf, I said I wouldn\u2019t bc I like girls. Got so much shit from her very conservative mom, parents told me the same thing about it being the mom\u2019s right to tell her kids about gay people \u201cwhen they\u2019re ready,\u201d was told to apologize and I absolutely refused. Waiting for a homophobe to teach their kid to hate gay ppl (and themselves if they realize they aren\u2019t straight) is NOT better than showing a child a healthy and happy example of gay ppl. You did the right thing OP.", "I absolutely hate it when people use their religion to justify their bigotry. \n\nNTA. What you said was age appropriate and she asked the question you didn't bring it up. \n\nYour uncle was out of line to ask you to apologize to his homophobic wife.  \n\nAnd exactly how does he expect youn to \"walk it back\"? LIE? Isn't that a sin in the Catholic faith? What hypocrites!!", "Faith is all too often an excuse for inexcusable behavior.  You did nothing wrong, it sounds like the kid didn't bat an eye.  Your aunt is a homophobic bigot.  Screw apologizing.  And excellent username!", "So she doesn't require evidence for her beliefs. Not a flex.", "Exactly this. My kid is a teen now but when she was little, knowing we live in a very homogeneous area, I made sure I bought her books showing racial diversity and different family structures and that we talked about these things. Kids aren't born with prejudices, they learn them from the people around them so if you start early showing them that people love who they love and that differences are to be accepted not feared then they accept it. \n\nOP didn't say anything that wasn't age appropriate so nothing to apologise for.", "Yeah the content of the comments is the main thing! I'm pretty good at spotting them and I'll bet this is one", "Confirmed by his username. \ud83e\udd23", "As an Irish person, I just want to say fuck your aunt, she doesn't speak for all Irish people, we're not all homophobes. She's well behind the times anyway, Irish people voted to allow gay marriage some years back so she can't hide her bigotry behind that.", "present \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f", "Where did the OP say anything about sex? If you can only think of sex when you think about gay people, they're not the pervs in that situation. You realize that right?"]}
