We don't \"teach kids\" what straight is, they just see it in life. Same as gay, at least, ideally. It's just a part of life & not in anyway wrong.

She is going to meet plenty of gay folks in her life and her parents can't control that.

It\u2019s not up to parents to let their kids know gay people exist, they can explain what \u2018gay\u2019 is but if they haven\u2019t done that by age 7 then they\u2019ve already failed.

Hiding other races because they haven\u2019t told them other skin colours exist? No. They need to recognise their own failure to educate their child here. \n\nIt\u2019s not a big deal to say \u201csome men love men, some women love women\u201d, most kids just go \u201coh, ok!\u201d and return to whatever they were doing before.

Cool you told your kid that, but at 10 I can almost guarantee they have seen, heard or had conversations at school about these things before your talk. \nChildren live in the world, they see and hear things, they speak to people.

We have picture books that look at how families can be different for lots of reasons with different examples for as young and preschool. It is literally part of the national curriculum because not everyone has someone at home who can teach them these things, plus it is important to teach children mutual respect for differences as well as allow children who do have diverse families know they are normal and respected.
