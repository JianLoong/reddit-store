We don't \"teach kids\" what straight is, they just see it in life. Same as gay, at least, ideally. It's just a part of life & not in anyway wrong.

She is going to meet plenty of gay folks in her life and her parents can't control that. The idea that it's inappropriate for children to be aware of gay people's existence is so offensive and homophobic.

It\u2019s not up to parents to let their kids know gay people exist, they can explain what \u2018gay\u2019 is but if they haven\u2019t done that by age 7 then they\u2019ve already failed.

Hiding other races because they haven\u2019t told them other skin colours exist? No. They need to recognise their own failure to educate their child here. \n\nIt\u2019s not a big deal to say \u201csome men love men, some women love women\u201d, most kids just go \u201coh, ok!\u201d and return to whatever they were doing before. They\u2019re making it into a huge deal it didn\u2019t need to be, and that it should be some kind of secret implying shame, which is a very poor message to send to their daughter. \n\nP.S. \u201cyou know how she is\u201d.
