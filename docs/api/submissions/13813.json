Mine are generally 5 minute breaks and then I'm back. She often gets a phone call and spends 20-30 minutes in there chatting. Usually it's not a big issue, but we have had arguments about her ignoring everything while she's on the phone in the past. \n\n5 days ago we got a puppy. Since then I've been going outside to smoke to help house train him. I've also been sleeping on the couch so i can get up at night and let him out to pee. It's not a great night of sleep so when my wife gets up I go up to bed for a couple hours of peaceful sleep. \n\nYesterday, about half hour after going up, I hear the puppy yelping in pain. His eye got scratched and she doesn't know how because she was smoking. She says it was quick but her morning routine is to have coffee, smoke and talk on the phone until our son (4) gets up, sometimes it's an hour. Most likely the puppy was playing with our other dog and caught a paw to the face, something that likely wouldn't have happened if she had brought them outside or had even been sitting with them, since we try to keep rough play to a minimum. When I asked why she didn't go outside with them while smoking she said it was cold (40s) but the screen room isn't warmer and I've been doing it all week in similar temps.\n\nNow his eye is red and painful and he hasn't even had his first vet visit (it's Wednesday). Usually vet visits are my department but I told her she should take him since she wasn't watching and I don't want to go in there looking like a neglectful pet owner when I've been anything but. \n\nShe's now mad that I'm blaming her.

This could easily have happened while she was staring right at the puppy.  You don\u2019t even know *what* actually happened.  She didn\u2019t leave the puppy in any known-to-be-hazardous situation, accidents just happen.  \n\nOne of you needs to get the puppy to the vet today or tomorrow at the latest, though, eye injuries can have long-term consequences if left untreated - plus they just really hurt.  You\u2019d both be AH if you waited until Wednesday.  I worked in vet clinics for over a decade, and nobody is going to think anything of you coming in with a puppy with a scratched eye if you do it in a timely manner.  If you come in with a days-old eye injury?  The staff is definitely judging you.", "YTA. A scratch can happen in literally a second and in all sort of different scenarios, and not keeping your eye on your puppy literally every second of the day is not neglectful. No vet is going to assume you\u2019re neglectful over a minor injury sustained at home.", "YTA pets and kids get hurt sometimes. I wouldn't call this neglect", "YTA. It\u2019s unrealistic to think anyone can keep an eye on a puppy 24/7 with another dog in the house. It was an accident.", "YTA. Puppies play, it's part of learning how to socialize. It's no one's \"fault\", and keeping dogs (especially ones which live together) from playing isn't healthy. The \"old\" dog needs to learn how to play with the puppy, too. Don't be a helicopter owner. Unless one is particularly aggressive instead of merely playful, they'll sort it out.", "YTA. Pets injure themselves sometimes. She\u2019s entitled to spend some time smoking/drinking coffee/using her phone rather than watching the dog non-stop. \n\nNo one is going to think you\u2019re neglectful because the dog has a scratch.", "YTA \n\nYou need to seriously chill. I know you have the intention of taking care of your pet, but you can\u2019t protect pets forever. \n\nMy ex and I went to a comedy show. While we were out, my fully indoor kitten of the time (a year and a half old) managed to escape my house and got hit by a car. When I came home I found him by my house covered in piss and crying. He couldn\u2019t move his leg. I thought he just sprained his leg at the time but the vet informed us what happened the next day (his femur broke 100% in half, only a car could\u2019ve caused it by clipping him). I was stressed af trying to figure it out. \n\nYa know what made it worse? My ex having meltdowns saying that we should\u2019ve been here to watch him at all times. We shouldn\u2019t have gone out to that show. We can\u2019t leave the house again, we need to make sure we take care of him by keeping him in our sight 24/7. I reminded him it\u2019s impossible- we both work and we can\u2019t put our lives on freeze for an animal. He was freaking out the whole time. \n\nHe and I broke up right after this- another comment he made in the vets office that day was actually the push I needed to leave him (not relevant in your situation, just giving context). I moved out and I took the cat with me. It\u2019s been 6 and 1/2 years since the accident, he\u2019s 8 now. My cat has a metal plate in his leg permanently but other than that, he\u2019s perfect and he feels no pain since he has fully recovered since his surgery. \n\nPOINT IS- pets and animals ARE going to hurt themselves sometimes. You can\u2019t hover all the time. It\u2019s unnecessary stress and it\u2019s unrealistic as hell. \n\nGo through and puppy proof your house if you need to, watch him when he\u2019s around, but do other things besides dog stuff and don\u2019t yell at your girlfriend for not having the same expectations out of this experience.", "YTA - animals get into accidents. Yes, you need to watch them. But you cannot physically prevent them from ever getting hurt. Just like children. The puppy will learn from this as do human children from getting scratches and bumps. If you think this is bad you should see what horses are capable of doing to themselves. At any point in time we have at least one horse nursing a minor self-inflicted injury at our yard.", "YTA, you have a kid so you should realize that accidents happen. Puppies can be wild and carefree.. don\u2019t put that blame on her. You wouldn\u2019t want that blame on yourself- knowing it was an accident. Of course being more careful is something that needs to happen, but shit happens..", "YTA. You can't completely prevent two dogs who live in the same house from playing. Accidents happen. Take your dog to the vet.", "YTA... I'm sorry but I can't keep up with people who treat pets like kids. Yes, I like animals, and yes, I know they're quite a handful when they're young and are learning to behave, it doesn't mean one must make their life revolve around the puppy or kitty or wtv. If you're willing to sleep on the couch because of the dog fine, it's up to you, it doesn't mean everyone in your house hold should be doing the same. So if your wife doesn't care that much as to change her routine to accommodate the pet, as long as she isn't neglecting it's needs, she's not in the wrong.", ">Now his eye is red and painful \n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nThe animal should have gotten medical attention for this already instead of the two of you bickering and posting on Reddit. Yesterday was ~~Thursday~~ Saturday and his vet appointment is next Wednesday, ffs.\n\nYou already have a dog and one kid being ignored for half an hour while you go smoke. Why in the world are you adding a puppy to this mix and then neglecting his medical care?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And I would say that I have never ignored my child. I usually tell her that I am going to the bathroom and, if she wants something while I'm there, she comes to let me know. I also don't ignore her while I'm on the phone. I make sure she knows I'm on the phone and let the caller know because *gasp I'm a responsible adult.", "Wednesday was going to be his first visit.
