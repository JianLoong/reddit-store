You\u2019d both be AH if you waited until Wednesday.

If you come in with a days-old eye injury?  The staff is definitely judging you.", "YTA. A scratch can happen in literally a second and in all sort of different scenarios, and not keeping your eye on your puppy literally every second of the day is not neglectful. No vet is going to assume you\u2019re neglectful over a minor injury sustained at home.", "YTA pets and kids get hurt sometimes. I wouldn't call this neglect", "YTA. It\u2019s unrealistic to think anyone can keep an eye on a puppy 24/7 with another dog in the house. It was an accident.", "YTA. Puppies play, it's part of learning how to socialize. It's no one's \"fault\", and keeping dogs (especially ones which live together) from playing isn't healthy. The \"old\" dog needs to learn how to play with the puppy, too. Don't be a helicopter owner. Unless one is particularly aggressive instead of merely playful, they'll sort it out.", "YTA. Pets injure themselves sometimes. She\u2019s entitled to spend some time smoking/drinking coffee/using her phone rather than watching the dog non-stop. \n\nNo one is going to think you\u2019re neglectful because the dog has a scratch.", "YTA \n\nYou need to seriously chill. I know you have the intention of taking care of your pet, but you can\u2019t protect pets forever. \n\nMy ex and I went to a comedy show. While we were out, my fully indoor kitten of the time (a year and a half old) managed to escape my house and got hit by a car. When I came home I found him by my house covered in piss and crying. He couldn\u2019t move his leg. I thought he just sprained his leg at the time but the vet informed us what happened the next day (his femur broke 100% in half, only a car could\u2019ve caused it by clipping him). I was stressed af trying to figure it out. \n\nYa know what made it worse? My ex having meltdowns saying that we should\u2019ve been here to watch him at all times. We shouldn\u2019t have gone out to that show. We can\u2019t leave the house again, we need to make sure we take care of him by keeping him in our sight 24/7. I reminded him it\u2019s impossible- we both work and we can\u2019t put our lives on freeze for an animal. He was freaking out the whole time. He would yell and snap at me about this ordeal just because he was stressing himself out soooo much that it just boiled over and he took it out around him. \n\nHe and I broke up right after this- another comment he made in the vets office that day was actually the push I needed to leave him (not relevant in your situation, just giving context). I moved out and I took the cat with me. It\u2019s been 6 and 1/2 years since the accident, he\u2019s 8 now. My cat has a metal plate in his leg permanently but other than that, he\u2019s perfect and he feels no pain since he has fully recovered since his surgery. \n\nPOINT IS- pets and animals ARE going to hurt themselves sometimes. You can\u2019t hover all the time. It\u2019s unnecessary stress and it\u2019s unrealistic as hell. \n\nGo through and puppy proof your house if you need to, watch him when he\u2019s around, but do other things besides dog stuff and don\u2019t yell at your girlfriend for not having the same expectations out of this experience.", "YTA - animals get into accidents. Yes, you need to watch them. But you cannot physically prevent them from ever getting hurt. Just like children. The puppy will learn from this as do human children from getting scratches and bumps. If you think this is bad you should see what horses are capable of doing to themselves. At any point in time we have at least one horse nursing a minor self-inflicted injury at our yard.", "YTA, you have a kid so you should realize that accidents happen. Puppies can be wild and carefree.. don\u2019t put that blame on her. You wouldn\u2019t want that blame on yourself- knowing it was an accident. Of course being more careful is something that needs to happen, but shit happens..", "YTA. You can't completely prevent two dogs who live in the same house from playing. Accidents happen. Take your dog to the vet.", "YTA... I'm sorry but I can't keep up with people who treat pets like kids. Yes, I like animals, and yes, I know they're quite a handful when they're young and are learning to behave, it doesn't mean one must make their life revolve around the puppy or kitty or wtv. If you're willing to sleep on the couch because of the dog fine, it's up to you, it doesn't mean everyone in your house hold should be doing the same. So if your wife doesn't care that much as to change her routine to accommodate the pet, as long as she isn't neglecting it's needs, she's not in the wrong.", ">Now his eye is red and painful \n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nThe animal should have gotten medical attention for this already instead of the two of you bickering and posting on Reddit.

He was literally just trying to do his job (he's a blue heeler) I thought the worst the second I saw him jump and was crying as we stopped, recalled him and checked for any obvious wounds. \n\nThe vet never once assumed abuse. They gave him some more water and some treats, cleaned his road rash, made sure his body was ok and there were no broken bones. Nothing. He was just sore and very very proud of himself. He now has a small scar where hair doesnt grow above his eye.  His breed's instincts took over and he got a little banged up. Same as your dog. It's a dog. They might give a little banged up every once in a while while playing. A small scratch is nothing a puppy wont give even it's most loved human by accident. \n\nBlaming your wife is the most ridiculous part of this. When my dog got hurt, my husband and I didn't blame each other. We were more worried about the dog and buying a new crate. We still don't know how he got out as the crate had never failed before, he'd never gotten out before and we always make sure it's well secured when we go for that particular drive. (We only ever let him ride in the back when we're on our way to do his run with the truck. It's a very short drive to a secluded location so he can \"herd\" our truck going 20-30mph because he needs lots of exercise, he's loves running full tilt and he's a dog bred to herd, run and be outside working with other animals) It was no one's fault.

He was so speedy I had zero time to react until after the accident happened. And I AM a helicopter dog mom.\n\nSee that there? Accident? Yeah, they happen. Especially with littlies of any kind.", "I have a middle-aged cat who turns up one day squinting her eye... Apparently was playing rough with one of the other cats, and took a claw to the face.  No lasting damage, thankfully.  But they don't go easy on each other, and there is not much you can do about it.  It is a miracle my puppy didn't end up with claws to eyes, for all the times that the cats decided to teach her how to behave around cats (two years later, they still go for her face).", "I hear so many people talk about how they can't go anywhere because their dog has separation anxiety but also refuse to work on it with the help of a vet or other behavioral specialist.\n\nDogs live 10-13 years on average. It's highly unlikely that you'll be able to spend every moment of every day with that dog, and it's better to work on it now than to have to be separated from the dog during an unplanned incident outside of your control.", "This!", "Hold up. Let's not gloss over the fact that they NAMED HIM FRISBEE \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nOnce me and my husband put our blue heeler in his crate in the back of our truck to go for a drive. We were on our way to our little spot where we took him out and let him \"herd\" our car  going about 20-30mph to give him some exercise and he kept up easyyy. We were going about 50mph down the road and just so happened to pass a field of sheep because we went a different way. He somehow got out of his crate (we still don't know how) jumped out of the back of the truck, got FOLDED but hopped up, ran through the fence and started herding the sheep \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 the guy who owned the sheep came out immediately thinking he was a threat but we were already running trying to catch up so he just joined in the chase \ud83d\ude02 We immediately recalled him when we were close enough for him to hear and see us, he came back and we noticed a limp and a bit of road rash above his eye because he hit the ground jumping out of our truck. The farmer helped us check him over, thanked our puppy for playing with his sheep and doing his job . (he is a cattle dog) he patted him a bit, gave him a dog bowl of water and sent us on our way. \n\nWe took him to the vet, explained the situation and he was absolutely fine. No major injuries, just sore and happy because he did a good boys job. They cleaned up his forehead/eye and we bought a new, more secure crate. Not once did they ever assume abuse, even before we explained what happened.", "So in your opinion a teenager and an infant deserve the same level of supervision?", "It.is.a.puppy. Not an infant. And your other dog isn\u2019t a teenager. And it still hurts itself! Get a grip bro. You\u2019re TA. Deal with it.", "It's a freaking dog, not an infant", "YTA no one should have to literally watch a puppy every single second. Accidents happen. This may be his first scratch but it definitely won't be his last.", "YTA. Is she supposed to sit & stare at the puppy all day? You\u2019re not being realistic. Do you have children? Because I have some news for you. Kids get hurt in the blink of an eye too.", "YTA: Do you expect the puppy to be watched at all times? Things like this are going to happen, it\u2019s not fun but it\u2019s the truth.", "YTA and I literally scratched my own eyeball a few years ago.  It\u2019s easier to happen than you think.", "YTA. Puppies are like toddlers; anything can happen even if you turn your back for a second. Hell, that's dogs generally. Generally speaking it's not good to leave multiple dogs alone together because things can kick off very quickly sometimes and cause a lot of damage, but this is usually in relation to leaving them alone in the house while you go out; being within hearing distance from them so you can tell if something bad happens is fine.\n\nYou don't want your puppy to constantly be with you 24/7, he'll end up with dreadful separation anxiety. A bit of space is totally fine.", "NTA idk why everyone here thinks puppies do not need to be supervised...they do and if theyre not supervised they should be up there dozens of ways a puppy can get hurt or hurt itself unsupervised theyre like babies. and two dogs should definitely be supervised when playing regardless.", "YTA only because there's no need to blame her. Dogs scratch their eyes, ears, arm pits, etc. and irritate them all the time. There's nothing you can do to prevent it other than using a cone, keeping ears clean, treating and preventing dry skin, and keeping the nails short and rounded. Puppies have sharp talons. Did you trim them yet? They need to be done weekly when they're young. \n\nI'm a dog professional. I've had several dog clients get eye irritation from hair flying around, eye boogers getting shaved out, or going home and scratching with freshly done nails. Nobody has ever treated me like you have your wife, and dog owners can be very snippy over even the most minor incidents. \n\nShe doesn't need to watch the dog take a piss. Neither of you need to be THAT vigilant or you're going to cause the puppy to have separation anxiety. It needs to go out alone or with the other dog from time to time so it learns independence. I understand puppies are babies and get into things, so puppy proof the yard. Put a camera back there. New pups are a handful but shit is going to happen in the blink of an eye. There's nothing she could have done to stop it from scratching even if she saw it happening.", "Wrap that puppy up in bubble wrap and watch how many ways it will still find to hurt itself.", "YTA\n\nWhat you described can happen at any time, regardless of how intensely someone is watching the dog. You can't watch a dog 100% of the time - you'll go crazy.\n\nI think you're upset by your wife's smoke breaks and are trying to find something easy to blame her on", "I head to toe groomed my horse, untied him and sent him on his merry way into the pasture. Not even 5 minutes later I turned around and he was standing in the barn with blood pouring down his back leg. Bc it involved a joint, I called the vet and while she was suturing, discovered gashes in his other leg. So he ended up with 14 sutures in one hock and 9 staples in the other. That was 15 years ago and we still have no idea how he pulled that one off.", "He says he has a 4 year old! I\u2019m genuinely baffled.", "Same. Same goes for people who are this way with their kids, honestly - I know they think they\u2019re building a healthy attachment, but I would argue their definition of the word \u201chealthy\u201d.", "Where in your post do you mention the 2 of you talking about smoking outside with the dogs?", ">\"Blame\" is definitely too strong of a word\n\nAnd yet,  you did blame her. \n\nYou said it was her fault and she was negligent. \n\nYTA. And over the top with this puppy, really", "Your vet would not have assured you it's not serious without looking at the dog with their own eyes. That's a major liability if it were serious and the dog developed an infection and lost the eye. \n\nWhat you should have done was take it in to an emergency vet. Yes, they cost more but it's better than waiting days to get medicated eye drops and an anti inflammatory. Can you imagine that happening to you? If you wouldn't wait for your own medical care after an accident then you shouldn't make your pet wait either.\n\nWhen my child got glitter glue in her eye we went immediately. You don't mess around with anything on the face because an infection could get serious very quickly. Being a puppy there could have been all sorts of harmful bacteria from pee and poop under the nails that could have gotten into the scratch. Come on now.", "My dog just naps and stares out the window all day when I\u2019m gone. Sometimes I leave the TV for her with some duck videos. But I\u2019m pretty sure she likes being alone some of the time so she can have the apartment to herself.", "It's usually the owner that has separation anxiety. I can't tell you how many come in stressing out about how bad their dogs anxiety is only for them to leave and it immediately stops shaking. It's taken a lot of work to get some clients to stop texting for updates or demanding I rush to get their dog finished. I intentionally keep those dogs the entire day and send videos of them chilling and playing. Fido needs to play with other dogs, meet every client that comes in, tear up some toys, nap in a communal bed, and watch the bakery customers going in and out next door. It's GOOD for their worlds to expand but owners subconsciously don't want that.  They'll even claim their dog isn't friendly with others and then act astonished when I toss them down on the floor and it's the popular socialite. I'm very strict with my puppy clients that their dog is not allowed to develop anxiety because they didn't work with them and they have to stay with me the entire day, once or twice a month, until adulthood. It works. I don't have shitty puppies. \n\nMind boggling. I don't get paid to rehabilitate dogs but here I am. \ud83d\ude44", "I have a middle-aged cat who turns up one day squinting her eye... Apparently was playing rough with one of the other cats, and took a claw to the face.", "When mine were puppies they were (more or less) constantly supervised or crated because yours is an apt description.", "Dogs aren't teenagers or infants. Because they're not people lol. Case in point: your older dog doesn't understand not to run around like a maniac so much that he injures both his knees. By that logic you should have been watching your older dog just as much in order to know when to get him back into the house before he causes himself injury.", "I would really think you\u2019d have better perspective on this given that you had an infant a few years ago. They\u2019re not the same. They are DOGS.", "YTA\n\nI've taken a paw to the face and had to go to urgent care. Cut her some slack.", "YTA", "YTA, dogs get hurt. They get overexcited and make a mistake.\n\nNobody is going to look like a neglectful pet owner, you think the vet hasn't seen an injury created by two dogs playing?\n\nGet the dog to the vet now, don't wait for Wednesday. It doesn't matter which of you does it, just one of you actually do it.", "YTA I had a small dog literally run his face too hard on the floor and scratch his eye. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to do no matter how careful you are and likely wouldn\u2019t have been avoided if your wife was there. That said I worked in veterinary for 10 years and eyes were not something we messed around and waited on. They can go from sort of bad to \u201comg this is awful!\u201d very quickly. Take the puppy to the vet before his first appointment. Ideally you\u2019ll call and get him in tomorrow.", "Don\u2019t you love when they walk RIGHT in front to you then stop?
