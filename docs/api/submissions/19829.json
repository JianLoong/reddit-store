Neither one of you is listening to the other. And the fact that he told you to bring things up before you get really upset tells me that you have your own issues with communication. There's no shame in getting couples therapy if you can't resolve issues on your own", "I guess maybe I'm missing something...    \n>If I change the AC temp, he goes and changes it back.    \n\nSo, why does your AC preference override his??  Plenty of people are comfortable at different temps.  When you're not comfortable, you change it.  When he's not comfortable, he changes it back.  Seems like that how it should work.

So you have to turn on a light.  So he takes the clothes inside.  So what??    \nMaybe I'm not understanding the sitch correctly.

The feeling of mild annoyance and confusion over why he didn\u2019t do something so obvious is what he feels when you leave the kids\u2019 clothes out to dry or leave the light on. But you have your reasons for doing those things, and if you explain your reasons he should be able to see that you aren\u2019t just being careless and leaving tasks for him, you just make different decisions than he does at times. \n\nDiscuss how much electricity it really takes to power the bathroom light or put the AC up for a bit while you\u2019re getting ready for work. Have you ever left the light or AC on longer than you meant to, and now he\u2019s paranoid about them being left on? It\u2019s still passive aggressive of him to turn them off while you\u2019re still using them, but it\u2019s something worth discussing. Your reasoning and his should be uncovered.", "ESH, stop leaving lights on", "NTA have another conversation and explain how what he did made you feel, use allot of I statements and what you had to do. Explain that his actions did not reflection of his words and how that makes you feel. Tell him why you told him aswell and that your trying to work on doing what he had asked instead of stewing of it as you did before. Don't apologize unessisarily, if he talks and says how what you did made him feel listen and apologize only if he interpreted your actions/words wrong. If he does not apologize though point that out and say you need an apology if you want to money forward past this. You need that and should have that for yourself.", "Esh.  You guys sound a lot like my husband and I.  He is the tidier one of us for sure.  I can guess the point your husband is trying to make.  He is likely picking up after you a lot more than you think.  It\u2019s not a productive way to deal with the problem though.  That said, your preferences do not override his.  You could be more tidy and energy conscious.  It doesn\u2019t sound like you are being very compromising either.  I have been married 23 years this year.  I have made an effort to be more tidy.  I was never a messy person per we but certain things just don\u2019t bother me the way it does my husband.  It doesn\u2019t bother me if a pair of shoes is in the living room or a cabinet door is left open.  Because I have made this effort, my husband leaves it alone when lack in the tidiness department.  That\u2019s the compromise we came to.  It\u2019s not a compromise to expect your husband to just live the way you want.  You need to think about what you can do so your husband doesn\u2019t feel like he needs to go behind you.  Turning off lights when you leave a room and keeping the AC at an energy conscious temperature are not big asks.", "NTA. Being passive-aggressive never solves anything.

If true, you can try to meet in the middle, but it's going to be hard for him to change.", "No he's a passive aggressive prick and y'all need to engage a therapist about communication and healthy conflict", "NTA, but I can see how it frustrated him that you built up this list of things that could have been simply addressed in the moment. This is what he was talking about with not bringing things up until you're frustrated.  When he turns off the light, you could just ask him not to right then, and the same for the rest of it.", "NTA.  He asked you to tell him & you did.  He's acting very petty & disrespectful.

So that he can tell me i should bring up things when they bother me. It\u2019s been 11 years. He was an alcoholic when I met him.

As I said at the end, it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal until his reaction. \n\nFor clarification, I leave the AC in our room lower after I shower bc I get ready for work before him (blow drying my hair in Texas gets hot). He changes it even though he\u2019s leaving the room (we have window units) and I\u2019m staying in there. His reason is bc the electric bill. I go to work sweating. \n\nIt\u2019s one sided with the kids. He doesn\u2019t ask me if I mind x,y or z. He just does it. \n\nAnd as for your last paragraph, I did not tell him it annoys me that he is tidy. I like things tidy also. I am just bothered that I need to ask to do things a certain way or it gets changed. It\u2019s constant. So I brought it up. And got a 4 year olds response.", "You sound older and more experienced in life. When you put it this way\u2026 it sounds like they both need to learn the art of compromise.
