My SIL has brought up to my brother about maybe letting her get a day off on Sundays, but he said no. \n\n2 days ago, Sophia asked her dad if she could not practice piano anymore because she didn't like it. My brother got pretty mad, and said absolutely not. Sophia kept on begging, which just made my brother angrier and they got into a pretty heated argument.\n\nYesterday, my SIL brought up the argument and asked for my opinion. I said that I thought Sophia shouldn't have to do something she didn't want to do and didn't think it was fair on her. SIL told my brother and he got really mad at me. I told him that it was just my opinion, and that caused him to be even more upset. \n\nHe told me I had no right to tell him out to raise his daughter (I wasn't, I just voicing my opinion).

That's too much for her.

My parents made our teenage years SO intense because they wanted us to get full-ride scholarship to college -- and actually most of us did. But now they wonder why all their adult kids live across the country so far from them and why none of us have our own children in music lessons!", "NTA - Sophia is 15 and it sounds like her life is more work than most adults.

He does not sound well.", "NTA for voicing your opinion especially if you were asked for it. soft YTA for what you said in the heat of the moment, that was a bit harsh...\n\nDad maybe feels it would be a waste to stop after all these years, but a lot of kids I know excel at piano and then quit it towards the end of high school - the journey of learning it is still valuable + coordination gained is still a benefit even if you don't become a professional pianist. Also she's still playing violin, and 5 hours a day on music must be disheartening,", "NTA and that poor young lady. I'm an educational psychologist and she needs FREE TIME! We all do. She's also at an age where social groups are important. \n\nIf she is done with piano, then she's done.

I was an excellent technician but had no real talent.  (i.e. I could read music and play it.  Even complicated pieces . . . but I couldn't even play happy birthday by ear).  I really wanted voice lessons but no-one cared.  I now have a niece who plays the cello and piano.  She LOVES this.  She practices all the time, on her own.  These are the kids that should be taking the lessons and enjoying themselves.  I was just wasting time and money.  It sucks being forced to do something that brings you no joy.  If she doesn't like these instruments, maybe your brother should be finding out what she IS interested in.", "NTA. This poor kid is going to be a burnt out nervous wreck by 20.", "NTA. \n\nBut, come on.  You decided to \"just offer your honest opinion\" about how he is raising his daughter, then decided to \"in the heat of the moment\" said his daughter will go no contact (that is how I know you are a redditor, because nowhere in real life are people so flippant about that).   All of this while you are depending on him for a place to live?  That just was unwise on your part.  You weren't wrong, and if he doesn't want you in his home, well you deal with the consequences of your actions.", "NTA\n\nIf it was in front of Sophia I could see some possible arguments but it was in a private conversation with your SIL. No matter what your opinion was (within reason), giving yours when solicited in a conversation amongst adults is completely valid and NTA behavior. Even if what you told your brother in the later argument is harsh, it's not a low-blow, it's a very valid concern for that level of controlling parenting. Completely NTA", "NTA. But ask you AH brother if he would be ok being forced to take classes on say knitting, or basket weaving, or playing the flute, or something, anything else that he doesn\u2019t want to do.", "NTA\n\nYou were specifically asked for your opinion. You gave your opinion. \n\nTough shit if your brother didnt like what you had to say. \n\nAt the end of the day, its his daughter and he can raise her how he (and his wife) want -- but unfortunately he will be learning the hard way, as no child responds well to autocracy.", "NTA! You were asked your opinion and gave it it. It doesn\u2019t sound like you did it in front of Sophia, and it sounds like his wife knew she needed \u2018back up\u2019. \n\nHas he always been this controlling?\n\nAre you looking for a 2 bed place to move into? So Sophia has somewhere safe to stay when she inevitably runs away.

You were asked for your opinion and you gave it . And your assessment is not wrong . She likely will go no contact  as soon as she can.", "OP isn't wrong though. Parents like that should be called out unless they are ok basically not having a kid talk to them after 18...", "How will she have time to call? She has to practice the violin and the piano and do well in school.

This is exactly the kind of behavior worth going no contact over. It seems flippant to you, but this kid has to grow up with 18 years of this controlling garbage while being denied her independence. It'll destroy her ability to make decisions for herself for years. She'll basically be learning lessons she should have been able to learn as a teenager in her twenties. Absolute nightmare, and absolutely no contact material. I'd be shocked if she didn't at least go low contact.", ">he can raise her how he (and his wife) want\n\nI have a feeling his wife also thinks he's unhinged and was hoping an outside opinion would snap him out of it.
