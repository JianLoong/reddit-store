No matter what your opinion was (within reason), giving yours when solicited in a conversation amongst adults is completely valid and NTA behavior.

But it's just not my role. I am not their parent. I am their Auntie. So what could I do? Be an awesome Auntie who took them on trips and camping, had real heart to heart talks with them, never judged them, let them state and own their thoughts and opinions, and most of all listen and love them. Kids really just need at least one adult in their life to serve as a role model. And by staying in my lane, I really got unprecedented access to his kids from both him and his ex. Now they're both in their 20's, independent and amazing young adults. They still have parent issues, but don't we all? But I have an amazing relationship with them. \n\nAnd the best part is that I still have a relationship with my brother.

If he gets physical with her, SIL can divorce his crazy ass and take the kids.", "NTA, it sounds like you sided not just with your niece, but also with your SIL who wanted backup on her side.

You were asked for your opinion and you gave it. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right\u2014that girl will run far far away from her dad the second she can.

Geez!", "NTA\n\nI've never understood the \"My child must be busy every single moment of every single day for them to be a productive member of society\".\n\nEither a child has that drive, or they don't.\n\nYour niece is starting to resent the amount of production she is being forced to output, and when she walks out that door, and once her college is paid for, she isn't going to want to be near your brother, and will probably reverse her output and be in a commune growing hemp.", ">He told me I had no right to tell him out to raise his daughter (I wasn't, I just voicing my opinion).\n\n>Yesterday, my SIL brought up the argument and asked for my opinion.\n\nYou were asked.\n\nNTA", "Nta. You are simply speaking truth. There are many things that a child can do that will help them learn and grow into a productive adult.

But he was also doing piano. And then I had to argue with my husband that he didn't need to keep doing piano if he was playing baritone. \n\nEventually, he was able to stop piano.\n\nI would say that if they want her to excel at all these things and she is, then maybe less chores. \n\nBut also why 2 instruments.  Maybe she can drop piano and try something new. And then she can be good at 3 instruments.  \n\nBut it probably doesn't matter. \nYou were being a good auntie.

Mom and daughter will probably leave once they are able to because it is controlling", "NTA\n\nBrother is going to make her hate music entirely best case, never speak to him again when she hits 18 or graduates college more likely. \n\nEvery human deserves at least 1 day a week to rest and recharge IMO.

But he is horribly controlling and is very likely to lose his daughter because he refuses to care about her feelings and what she wants. If she likes violin but not piano let her dedicate her time to that instead of wasting time and effort on piano for no reason. Also if he doesn\u2019t give her a break she\u2019s going to massively burn out and end up losing the benefits of any potential she has and any opportunities he\u2019s tried to give her.", "Sounds like your SIL weaponized your opinions.....

She doesn\u2019t succeed at things because she is afraid to fail. Started a bunch of studies and didn\u2019t finish any. Also can\u2019t seem to hold a job because all of her jobs are not what her father wanted.", "I also got a full ride\u2014 but without all the stress. My parents said two activities were required, with one needing to be physical in nature. I chose band and karate. \n\nThey didn\u2019t care which ones I picked so long as I actively engaged with practice for what I chose and kept my grades up.  It was plenty for colleges to like what they saw. \n\nThe rest of my time was mine. \n\nI had the best childhood.", "You're an idiot.", "[removed]", "[deleted]", "There was never a need to be concerned about obtaining full ride scholarships in the USSR.", "As are you ...", "[removed]", "Bot?", "Bot", "I ment originally.  That part was easier from what my parents told me provided you got in.", "I am sorry you suffered abuse, but attaching the term abuse to forced music lessons is absolutely irresponsible.  Imagine calling child services and reporting forced music lessons as the abuse.  They will think you are joking.\n\nForcing a child to take music lessons is not abuse.  Its the parents job to control their child's time because children are generally going to want to do more \"fun\" activities. I certainly think this parent is going to likely push their child to hate music, and resent him for forcing this but it is not abusive.", "Controlling over an adult, yes its abusive.\n\nOver a child?  That is the parents job to control their lives.  He may be  over the top and it may cause issues as the child gets older but its not abusive.  Imagine calling child services to report child abuse and you tell them that the parent is making their child take music lessons.  You would lucky if they didn't arrest you for filing a false report.", "That\u2019s ridiculous. My children don\u2019t like eating vegetables or going to school. So I\u2019m an abuser?", "who me? no. I'm not. i just wanted to point out that driving the child to do something she doesn't want to do for hours a day is a form of child abuse.\n\nI doubt a bot would make my spelling errors.", ">child services\n\nlol.\n\nI showed them my mom's scorched heroin spoons and the outcome was, \"You still have a roof and nobody is putting an unwanted dick in you so *shrug*.\"\n\nYou need a sane measuring stick. This ain't it.", "You are ridiculing the severity of what OP's niece is going through by calling it simply \"forced music lessons\", without mentioning what those mean to OP's niece. It is five hours, seven days a week, and when asked for a day off, or to drop one instrument (still making it two hours/day), she is denied, full on, despite being a fifteen year old. \n\nYou even seem to allude that children shouldn't have any fun hobbies? What kind of upside world is this, children... not being allowed to be... *children*? \n\nThe father is absolutely very controlling, and if you have no idea how abuse can look like to an outsider, I think you shouldn't humour me with false empathy at the start of your reply.", "You have to adapt with your child developmentally. A parent controls 100% of a 4-year-old\u2019s time. By the time they\u2019re 10, a parent is controlling maybe 70-80%. \n\nAt 15, that number should not be near 100%, and with this dad, it is. Think about it, in three years she will be legally capable of controlling 100% of her time, and may even have to. Does it make sense or does it help her to prepare for the real world to have 100% of her time dictated from the top-down? She\u2019s not learning any significant self-motivation, self-exploration, individuation, and YES, recreation.\n\nI have known many people who have parents like this. It\u2019s abusive. These kids do not turn out well-adjusted, they turn out believing that high achievement is their only source of value. They crumble in the face of any perceived failure, and they feel intense anxiety and depression when they\u2019re not constantly busy or climbing some ladder. Contentedness for them feels like they\u2019re actively dying.\n\nThis is abusive, the impact it can have is severe. It\u2019s not physically abusive, but it is absolutely horrible parenting.", "At 15, you have to teach your child autonomy and how to make decisions of their own. And FYI, mental abuse is so under reported because of shit like that and your reasoning and people not taking it seriously!! You\u2019re part of the fucking problem.", "This is not true. If you\u2019re a parent, you could benefit from rethinking this. A parent\u2019s job is NOT to control their lives, but to 1) ensure safety and 2) prepare them to be capable adults\n\nThree main parenting styles: \n\nAuthoritarian: total or near total control of child\u2019s life and choices\n\nAuthoritative: discipline and reasonable consequences, mixed with appropriate autonomy \n\nPermissive-indulgent: give the kid anything they want, allowance of anything and everything\n\nGuess which one of these leads to the most well-adjusted adult.", "You should keep serving them veggies, if you decide to force fed them, that can cause a bad relationship with food and even develop an ED. \nThings like school, and vaccines (depending on the country) are the law. If you, for example, insist on homeschooling your kids when they really don't want to, can be a sign of abuse.\nIf your kids have valid reasons to want to change schools,and you just dismiss it even tho you have the power/possibility of doing so, can be a sign  of abuse. \nIf your kids don't want to change schools but you dismiss it even tho is entirely possible for you to keep sending them to the same school, can be a sign of abuse.\nLastly, abuse are not isolated actions. And you have to have common sense. If you are constantly dismissing your child's feelings and opinions for no valid reason, I don't know what to tell you.\nKids are people too, and you should give them more autonomy as they grow up, that doesn't mean what they say goes since the moment they are born (they can't even talk at that point, duh). But is perfectly reasonable for a teenager to chose their own extracurricular activities.", "Do you make them spend five hours a day choking down vegetables they don't like?", "Have you heard of an excluded middle? If your child doesn't want to go to school, you force them. But there's a big difference between asking them to do what is normal and making them a music slave who is prevented from enjoying recreation which not only is good for subjective well-being, but is good for physical health and psychological development.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is bad parenting, period. Child development experts explicitly advise considering a child's wishes and giving them independence, especially in an age appropriate fashion, so quite a bit as a teen.", "I am so sorry that you had to endure that.  We disagree on whether forced music lessons are abuse, lets leave it at that.", "Its not false empathy, I truly feel horrible that you, or anyone, had to endure abuse as a child.  \n\nWhile I don't believe what this parent is doing can be considered abuse, please do not think I believe he is doing the right thing.  I think he is making a huge mistake and it will likely come back to haunt him.  I do not condone what he is doing unless there is a reason behind it.  We do not know if there is a deeper reason, so It might be exactly what this child needs. \n\nI just do not believe it is abuse.", "I agree that a 15 yo should be learning to be their own person and make decisions for themselves, **to a point**.\n\nI had to force my son to join a sports team in High school, he didn't want to.  He was very much against it.  He ultimately joined the soccer team and was an exceptional player through high school and even earned some scholarships.  However, the people he was hanging around with and the trouble he was getting into forced me to take action.  Joining the soccer team against his will changed the course of his life. Every one of those kids he was hanging with at the time have been in and out of jail over the last 15 years, and half of them are addicts.  My son is 30 and has a 6 figure career.  Yes I forced him to play, no it was not abuse.\n\nYou would have claimed what I did was mental abuse I suppose. Had he gotten his way back then for fear of abuse, I could have buried my son years ago from an overdose  instead of going to his wedding in 2 weeks.\n\nMaking your child take part in activities they do not want to is not abuse.\n\nThis parent seems to be going overboard, on the surface, but we do not know his motivation.  We only know that his child isn't happy and you are ready to condemn him as an abuser because of that alone.  But, an unhappy child is not necessarily an abused child.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo no, I am not part of the fucking problem, your ignorance is the problem.", "I don't disagree with what you posted, but we are talking about abuse, not well adjusted.  My comment was about it being abuse, which it is not.  It is apparently an Authoritarian parenting style.", "I think five hours a day of forced music lessons is worse than what I endured.", "But yes you forced him to play, but he then ENJOYED IT. She\u2019s been forced to, and is no longer enjoying it. And it\u2019s just piano, she still wants to do her other instrument. \nI\u2019ve got a 15 year old daughter as well. And she\u2019s got complete control over what she chooses to do and what she doesn\u2019t. And she plays rugby full time all year because she LOVES it. \nThis girl isn\u2019t getting anytime to be herself. Do some things SHE WANTS to do.\nI\u2019m 35 now, and I don\u2019t talk to my father kuch because he was VERY much like op brother is. \nHe never allowed me to explore other things that I showed interest in, and that made me struggle immensely through my 20\u2019s and now early 30\u2019s which who I am outside of sports. Even though it\u2019s so far removed. It\u2019s one thing if you force them to do it and they end up liking it, versus being forced to, for years none the less and now at 15, she doesn\u2019t want to do it anymore. And forcing her to do so is NOT giving her autonomy of her own choices.", "I can only guess.  I know it is rough.  I had 2 cousins (brother and sister)who were forced to learn the piano as children through high school, and I know they hated it to the point of not playing the piano for 10 years or so after they graduated high school.  \n\nI did not have to worry about it since my father was killed in a car accident when I was a young teen and my family fell apart in a different way.", "I agree that this parent is doing the wrong thing, and its probably not going to end well for his relationship with his daughter.  I certainly do not condone or agree with his approach.  I just disagree that is abuse.", "Emoitional neglect may be a better term to use I suppose. . I may have been harsh throwing out abuse. But its for sure not the right way to go about things. And looking back, I'm projecting a tad bit with what I went through when I was this girls age. And while I did go through various states of neglect when I was a teenager and I truly feel for this girl, that's why I got so passionate!", "NTA he's going to wonder why she never calls him when she moves out", "Well it was only going to go one way. Good on you for being honest. I'm pretty sure your SIL set you up. NTA", "NTA \n\nI had similar experiences to her at that age (having passed my grade 8 in piano) and she\u2019s obviously not enjoying. I was a \u2018prodigy\u2019 and had grade 8 distinctions  in 3 instruments by the time I was 14. And I hated piano, so I was allowed to stop it. \n\nI loved sax and French horn so focused on them. She won\u2019t be world class, but your brother is forcing her to try to be. She already does too much practice on the other instrument \n\nHer parents need to let her live/relax, so she doesn\u2019t resent them full time when she hits 18", "OP- try to keep the line of communication open with Sophia the next couple of years without your brother and SIL involved.

She might be so controlled by this asshole her parenting opinions are never listened to, so she tried protecting her child using ops opinion.", "NTA. Aw, I feel bad for Sophia. Your brother is being controlling and it won't bode well for their future relationship.", "Let me put it this way. This is 5 hours a day of intense, focused, physically draining work. 35 hours a week, that's full time job hours on top of everything else. If the parent were forcing their kids to work in a sweatshop or the mines, we would absolutely call it abuse. This is upper middle class coded abuse and the dad isn't making a direct profit, but otherwise this is right out of Dickens.", "This is so stupid lol.  The parent job is to take care of what they bring to the world and that child grow up to fin in the society they live in, not to dictate what the child want or like. Thats sounds abusive.", "> I doubt a bot would make my spelling errors.\n\nBots tend to copy and paste, so they might.\n\nStill, sorry for doubting you!", "There is always a deeper reason to a parent's abuse. Mine was because they were abused. So they abused me. Doesn't get much deeper than that. \n\nIf you would read what children of narcissists suffered, this is up there. Controlling behaviour, a parent living vicariously through their child, unable to take any form of criticism. The niece absolutely must perform, and there is no discussion to be had.\n\nThere is really absolutely no good reason to force a child to play two instruments, 5 hours a day, seven days a week. \n\nAbuse isn't only screaming, hitting or neglecting a child. Abuse quite often looks like good parenting from the outside. \n\nWe should *never* excuse one form of abuse because we think other forms of abuse are more worthy of the word. It's what keeps children enmeshed to their parents.  It's what makes a lot of victims of abuse unable to speak up, because X, Y and Z had it worse.", "And authoritarian parenting borders on abuse, and some states may even charge parents with neglect or abuse. Authoritarian parenting leaves children with crippling self-esteem, mental health issues, and resentment toward their parents, which will lead to this outcome if the father continues to force his child into those unwanted, useless piano lessons. You can't just compare apples to oranges, your son's story is different and his daughter's story is different. It's textbook abuse, he abuses his daughter whether you like it or not. Abuse is abuse period.", "The control is bad but if anytime she tries to speak up for her self or explain her feeling such as needing a day off from a 7 days a week heavy load he snap on her it\u2019s verbal abuse ! He\u2019s leading his daughter to be in a abusive relationship when she grows up ! Bc she\u2019ll think that a man only shows he loves you by control and anger. And you\u2019re excuse of what child services would do is irrelevant when the system is so flawed that kid in the system or under watch are still being abused and kill while there. Child services sucks and kids slip through the cracks everyday."]}
