Also she's still playing violin, and 5 hours a day on music must be disheartening,", "NTA and that poor young lady. I'm an educational psychologist and she needs FREE TIME! We all do. She's also at an age where social groups are important. \n\nIf she is done with piano, then she's done.

I really wanted voice lessons but no-one cared.  I now have a niece who plays the cello and piano.  She LOVES this.  She practices all the time, on her own.  These are the kids that should be taking the lessons and enjoying themselves.  I was just wasting time and money.  It sucks being forced to do something that brings you no joy.

All of this while you are depending on him for a place to live?  That just was unwise on your part.  You weren't wrong, and if he doesn't want you in his home, well you deal with the consequences of your actions.", "NTA\n\nIf it was in front of Sophia I could see some possible arguments but it was in a private conversation with your SIL. No matter what your opinion was (within reason), giving yours when solicited in a conversation amongst adults is completely valid and NTA behavior.

This is exactly the kind of behavior worth going no contact over. It seems flippant to you, but this kid has to grow up with 18 years of this controlling garbage while being denied her independence. It'll destroy her ability to make decisions for herself for years. She'll basically be learning lessons she should have been able to learn as a teenager in her twenties. Absolute nightmare, and absolutely no contact material.

However much you think you know about your nieces and nephews they are not you kids and there could be much ypu do not understand about the argument. Maybe she is only wanting to stop practicing because she is having a particularly difficult couple of weeks, or having trouble with a new technique, or maybe some kid bullied here over it.

I know you were asked for your opinion by the SiL, but it's so much easier to just shut your mouth (I'm saying this from my pov when I really wanted to say something to help the situation).\n\nAs an awesome Auntie, I wanted to let my brother know all the ways he was failing his kids. lol. But it's just not my role. I am not their parent. I am their Auntie. So what could I do? Be an awesome Auntie who took them on trips and camping, had real heart to heart talks with them, never judged them, let them state and own their thoughts and opinions, and most of all listen and love them. Kids really just need at least one adult in their life to serve as a role model. And by staying in my lane, I really got unprecedented access to his kids from both him and his ex. Now they're both in their 20's, independent and amazing young adults. They still have parent issues, but don't we all? But I have an amazing relationship with them. \n\nAnd the best part is that I still have a relationship with my brother. So I lovingly say stay in your own lane and ask,\" what have you done to be an awesome auntie today\"?", "NTA. She probably would love the piano still if she had a proper life balance.

What is your brother going to do? Ground her? From doing what? No social life to speak of anyways. If he gets physical with her, SIL can divorce his crazy ass and take the kids.", "NTA, it sounds like you sided not just with your niece, but also with your SIL who wanted backup on her side. I feel for Sophia and judging by his behavior you probably aren\u2019t far off in what you said.", "NTA. You were asked for your opinion and you gave it. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right\u2014that girl will run far far away from her dad the second she can.

Geez!", "NTA\n\nI've never understood the \"My child must be busy every single moment of every single day for them to be a productive member of society\".\n\nEither a child has that drive, or they don't.\n\nYour niece is starting to resent the amount of production she is being forced to output, and when she walks out that door, and once her college is paid for, she isn't going to want to be near your brother, and will probably reverse her output and be in a commune growing hemp.", ">He told me I had no right to tell him out to raise his daughter (I wasn't, I just voicing my opinion).\n\n>Yesterday, my SIL brought up the argument and asked for my opinion.\n\nYou were asked.\n\nNTA", "Nta. You are simply speaking truth. There are many things that a child can do that will help them learn and grow into a productive adult.

If he can\u2019t see that he\u2019s a controlling idiot.", "This is sadly comical - he wants her to excel in (specifically) piano AND violin.  Sounds like shes living his dream for him.   NTA.  He needs to open his eyes and know what hes doing.", "NTA but her mom needs to step up big time. She\u2019s allowing this nonsense to go on because she\u2019s afraid of your brother.

This control freak is stealing his daughter's childhood, and she will probably never touch an instrument again after she escapes this home.", "NTA but I'm curious, were you guys raised like that?\n\nYou don't have to answer I'm being nosey.", "\"You don't understand honey you worked to hard at this thing I decided you have to do\" no wonder he is quick to anger seems as controlling as a drill Sergeant", "Oh no. I'm so sorry. My husband was stuck on our oldest doing piano. He hated it. And when he started at a new school in 5th grade, they offered him an instrument.  He chose the Baritone. But he was also doing piano. And then I had to argue with my husband that he didn't need to keep doing piano if he was playing baritone. \n\nEventually, he was able to stop piano.\n\nI would say that if they want her to excel at all these things and she is, then maybe less chores. \n\nBut also why 2 instruments.  Maybe she can drop piano and try something new. And then she can be good at 3 instruments.  \n\nBut it probably doesn't matter. \nYou were being a good auntie. So sorry that your brother was so mad at you.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother is a horrible parent.", "The child's mother asked for your opinion and you gave it", "Sophia could just play badly on purpose", "NTA. You're right in your opinion, and you're probably right in your prediction. Your brother is TA. If he still doesn't believe you, show him all the comments.", "NTA\n\nYou wouldn't have even been if you gave your opinion without being asked for it. Parents' agency to \"raise their children as they see fit\" really ends when it becomes (borderline) abusive, and as adults, we absolutely can and should be the voice of children of parents like your brother.", "Nta you told him the truth. Mom and daughter will probably leave once they are able to because it is controlling", "NTA\n\nBrother is going to make her hate music entirely best case, never speak to him again when she hits 18 or graduates college more likely. \n\nEvery human deserves at least 1 day a week to rest and recharge IMO. Tossing someone for voicing an opinion makes brother an even bigger AH imo.", "NTA....But hopefully in 5 years when he complains he never sees her you can tell him I told ya so. So adding a NTA for that because we all KNOW it's coming.", "NTA. You SIL asked your opinion. You shared it. You're not undermining his parenting as it sounds like niece isn't aware you expressed an opinion.  \n\nBrother needs to AT MINIMUM discuss piano with daughter, and preferably let her quit if she wants. She's old enough to make that decision and she's not going to excel at something she hates", "I had a classmate who had practices for everything before & after school. My mum said \u201cshe never gets time to play\u201d - or use her imagination. She got to 16, discovered boys & gave up all ideas of excelling in anything. She now paints rocks for a living.

She\u2019s also going to hate music because if him. \n\nHe\u2019s the asshole with a capital ASSHOLE.", "NTA. Your opinion is valid and I agree with all your points. I feel really sorry for Sophia. She will definitely resent her father (and probably her mother for giving into her father) as she ages, though I'm sure she already does.", "NTA.", "So I'm guessing he wants absolutely no relationship with the kid when they get older.", "NTA.

But he is horribly controlling and is very likely to lose his daughter because he refuses to care about her feelings and what she wants. If she likes violin but not piano let her dedicate her time to that instead of wasting time and effort on piano for no reason. Also if he doesn\u2019t give her a break she\u2019s going to massively burn out and end up losing the benefits of any potential she has and any opportunities he\u2019s tried to give her.", "Sounds like your SIL weaponized your opinions..... SHE asked the opinion then used it to try and convince him to lighten up...... You are not teh AH, but both brother and SIL are", "Sucks as a parent and as a husband. His wife tried to get him to listen and give their daughter some relief from the constant pressure and he steamrolled her. She was so desperate.\n\nOP, maybe SIL wants to get a divorce and an apartment together....", "Are you from USSR originally because your story seems sadly familiar:)", ">It really isn't abusive, at all, by any definition.  \n>  \n>This just diminishes the validity of actual claims of child abuse.", "And divorce", "It really doesn't, at all, by any definition.  \n\nThis just diminishes the validity of actual claims of child abuse.", "He was asked a question.

If I were his wife I\u2019d put my foot down about giving their daughter a day to relax and unwind. I\u2019d find the hundreds of articles out there about how pushing people this hard usually leads to burn out and failure instead of success.
