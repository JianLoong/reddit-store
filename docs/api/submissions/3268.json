My father and his wife solved conflict with ignorance and I was so scared of conflict that I tried everything I could to prevent it. I went to school and then back to my room instantly. I lived in a shell, kind of, because I felt like a disturbance and a burden to my father and stepmom and didn't want to interfere with their life or relationship all too much.\nMy stepmother's hostility towards me made me feel unwelcome and I didn't want to give her more reason to dislike me, so I tried not to spend too much time with them.\n\nI went in and out of psychiatry because I didn't want to live anymore and my parents didn't know what to do about it. My mom told me after I became an adult that she felt like she was failing as a parent back then and that she had hoped that other people could help me more than she could back then. I don't know whether my father felt the same way, but his way of dealing with my mental illness changed over time.\nAt first he was very supportive of me and always told me to go with whatever felt right and not force myself to go to social gatherings/clean my room all in one day etc.\nBut gradually he became less and less understanding and got annoyed when I had panic attacks instead of supporting me. I think my Stepmom had something to do with it, but I can't be sure obviously.\n\nI know that I was not an easy kid. I didn't know why I felt or reacted in the ways I did most of the time and I chose to pity myself for everything (getting bullied, losing a loved one, being sexually harassed by my mother's ex etc.) instead of taking responsibility for my life and making the best out of it. I only learnt that when I was 20 and got proper diagnoses and psychotherapy for those specific issues I had.\nI put a lot of burden on my parents and thought it was their responsibility to make my life \"less of a living hell\" instead of finding coping mechanisms myself and I think my father was tired of taking that responsibility at some point, which I can understand.\nMistakes were made at many ends and I am definitely not a saint, but cutting my stepmother and my father out of my life after they signaled me that I wasn't welcome in theirs anymore by ignoring me was a necessary part of my healing process.", "I am pretty sure they don't want me in their lives, since there was no contact for years and my father didn't say anything about wanting to see me in his message at all, which means that meeting their grandchild together with me being present is probably not what they want.\n\nI don't know if I would be open to meeting them both before the child is born to build a bit of trust because of the mean message my stepmother sent me on Facebook messenger. If it was just my father I would be open but I am pretty sure that he wants my stepmother to be involved aswell and that would only cause conflict and stress for everyone.\n\nThey always sided with each other and when one of them was mad at me the other was automatically mad at me too, despite me not doing anything to them. If one of them started ignoring me they both did, so I highly doubt that my stepmother would not have an impact on my father when it comes to his grandchild.

Sorry to hear about his non reaction to other things.", "Hey OP, your post/comments are really hard to read and the person your replying to is being super insensitive. You weren't fighting with them, you were defending yourself. When you loose a loved one, experience bullying or sexual abuse it isn't self pity, it's grief and processing traumatic events. You were not an easy kid because you were not having a typical childhood experience. You are being so hard on yourself because that's all anyone did to you for a long time. Most people would not survive what you have been through in your short life. Your father has learned nothing, we know this because he is still being abusive towards you, only in a more subtle way. You owe them nothing and nothing that they, or anyone else, put you through was your fault nor did you \"bring it on yourself\". Even if you did have substance abuse issues as a teen, that would also not be your fault. Why do people think teens have these kind of issues?! It makes me sick to think they would ever be blamed for trying to so desperately escape a reality they didn't create for themselves. It sounds like you are highly responsible and that you've come a really long way in the healing process. Please remember that you have no obligation to your parents, they will always have some kind of hold on you because trauma bonds are sadly a thing, but you are strong enough to do right by yourself and your baby, you have proven it by surviving and thriving this far. Congratulations on your pregnancy. I'm sure you'll be an excellent parent!\n\nEdit, spelling", "Never tell yourself you were \u201ca difficult kid\u201d. You were a kid dealing with abuse and issues years beyond what your brain and level of maturity were capable of dealing with. \n\nIt absolutely WAS your parents responsibility to make your life less like a living hell. It was THEIR responsibility not to abuse you. It was THEIR responsibility to get you help for your mental health long before you were trying to unalive yourself. It was THEIR responsibility to teach you the mechanisms for coping with big feelings. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019ve taken responsibility for learning yourself what your parents failed to teach you as a child, but never blame yourself for their failure.", "You, as the parent, get to set all conditions now. \n\nIf you want to meet your dad by yourself, you can set that condition. You also get to set the condition that your father visit only with you present and with him treating you perfectly pleasantly, or else the visit ends. It's one thing if you really can't bring yourself to do it, that's fair.  \n\nI am not saying to use your child as leverage, but I think you will find them more willing to obey your wishes when it comes to access to your child.  \n\nIt also isn't an \"all or nothing\" proposition. If you agree to let them meet the baby once when it is born, that doesn't mean they always get to see the baby, whenever, forever. Maybe once a year around the grand baby's birthday or your dad's birthday, etc. \"This last visit went well, let's try for a trip to the zoo.\" \"the zoo visit was ok, let's try for a holiday lunch.\" \"No, not this month. things are too crazy.\"  \"I'm sorry, that occasion won't work for us.\" \n\nYou have the right to insist that the minute you aren't satisfied, the interaction ends. Maybe that time is now, and you wish to maintain no contact, and that would be OK.  I just wanted to point out that you have options. They are reaching out, so you get to decide how to respond. You have the opportunity to set a whole new dynamic. Wishing you the best."]}
