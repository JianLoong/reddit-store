You husband said \u201cDoordash\u201d and his boss just came back with the first food delivery service he thought of. You would be assuming that he had the quick wit and prejudice against you to associate your weight with over-eating and Uber eats. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA but I do think you\u2019re overreacting. Give the boss another chance (especially since he supposedly a great guy). If he does it again, you know the truth, otherwise it was just a slip of the tongue.", "NAH I don\u2019t understand how that\u2019s an insult. Even after reading the explanations.", "So let me get this straight, your husband\u2019s boss made an inappropriate comment and even though your husband agrees that was wrong and is on your side, you still punish him? For something her didn\u2019t do? Yes YTA.", "What\u2019s the insult? They literally do the same job. I\u2019m confused. \n\nIs there a stigma attached to uber eats?\n\nI thought everyone thought door dash was low rent, because they don\u2019t pay well and try to shake down their customers. \n\nThis may have been a compliment. What was his tone?", "NAH.  It's not like expecting him to walk to your car is a major ordeal, so I don't think you're an asshole. But I don't think the boss was making a comment about your appearance. It seems to be more of a joke against your husband, like, \"this chum is lying about being married, it's an uber getting his food, not his wife\"", "NAH.  I think you\u2019re reading in to his joke too much.  It just as if he had said \u201clooks like Grubhub to me\u201d or \u201clooks like Postmates to me.\u201d  I obviously don\u2019t know this for sure, but he would have to be an incredible, unbelievable AH to make a joke about your body like that.", "NAH. Why do you think \u201cUber Eats\u201d is transplanted \u201cyou\u2019re old and far?\u201d\nReally, REALLY weird for you to get that from his comment.", "NAH, because I don't really get the issue with Uber Eats. Why is that bad and Doordash isn't? Maybe in his mind, it was actually a compliment. However, in the end, it didn't feel that way to you.\n\nI do think this may be one of those situations where he thought he was saying one thing, but to you, it sounded like something bad. I know it sounds crazy because men and women never have misunderstandings, right?", "Bit of a leap to take this as a direct insult, sounds like he was just making a food delivery based joke like your husband did", "I think YTA on this one. It was a food delivery joke not a body shame joke. My wife has done the same thing to me when I brought her food. She called it husband eats because she knew I ate a little of it.", "I think you read way into something that wasn\u2019t there so I\u2019m gonnna say YTA", "I dont think it was a put down, if anything a compliment. Maybe he was low key hitting on you.", "NAH\n\nI'm thinking his tone might have made you think he meant it one way when he quite literally meant nothing by it. I mean I guess it could have been worse??.... He could have said \"grub hub\"...... I just don't see it as him making a comment about your body. Sounds more like he was just naming the other food delivery service.", "Could it be Uber eats because you were there eating with your husband?  I think he was making a pun about the fact you didn\u2019t drop it off and dash and that you stayed to eat. It was a harmless joke and not a personal attack.  I think you\u2019re way overreacting.", "NAH but I don\u2019t know if his comment was meant the way you took it. He could have just been making a joke about different delivery services.", "I mean the joke was themed to food delivery.  I think youre overthinking this.", "YTA - a big insecure one, creating problems out of nothing that your husband gets to suffer for.", "I guess if u make ur husband walk to the car in a way it punishes him for no reason. I guess the more important thing is that ur husband has a job and u giving him healthy food. Those things are more important than anything else. That's my pov.", "YTA. I think the boss is just one of those old\ndudes who thinks he is funny and meant nothing by that joke. Obviously I could be wrong. But I think he was just mildly making fun of your husband for having a meal delivery service (aka loving wife) and this has nothing to do with your body.", "I'm sensitive about my weight but I also have been known to make stupid remarks that were awkward and not meaning to be malicious.  I would give it another try and see if the behavior is any better.", "I think he's saying that she's too stout to Door***dash***, all she does is Uber***Eats***.", "*\u00dcber* means *over* in German.\n\n*Over-eats*.", "She made the wrong decision by projecting her insecurities onto the boss.", "WTF is wrong with someone so insecure they need to use it against someone? At 58 she needs to grow TF up and stop looking for problems where there are none. Imagine making problems for your husband because you got mad at the scale that morning. That's rude. Eat less if you're unhappy with your size, but don't punish your husband over it. He didn't stick that breadstick in her mouth.", "He's always in a rush in the morning because he snoozes the alarm forever; so we've had the routine now for years.

Of course, we weren't there and can't read any body language cues, so that might make a difference...but if that was a joke about \"dash\" vs \"eats\" it's pretty damn subtle and not likely to be understood by most people.   \n\n\nI'm still gonna say NTA...if OP feels uncomfortable then the husband can come out to the car and get the food.", "To be honest, I didn\u2019t get this, (but I wasn\u2019t there and didnt witness the tone) - is it possible he\u2019s just an awkward person who wanted to make a joke? \n\nI\u2019m always reminded in situations like this to \u201cnever assume malice that which can adequately be described as incompetence\u201d. It feels really out of place (and inappropriate) for a new boss to pick on the wife of an employees body / appearance, so much so that if someone did it in front of me I\u2019d assume they were \u201cnot all there\u201d. \n\nAgain, you were there, I was not. You have all the context. You\u2019re completely justified in asking your husband to come to the car regardless (or pack his own lunch) I\u2019m just wondering if the boss really sucks that hard, or if it was just him trying to be hip and cool with knowing the popular culture names .. of delivery drivers (bc he is not hip or cool).", "You should have given his boss the stare and replied,\u201dExcuse me,what does that mean?\u201d\nI bet he would have backpedaled real fast.I\u2019m with you on this OP.", "You have way too much time on your hands if you came up with this.

He\u2019s all over comments crapping on OP.", "The appropriate response to incel rage. Good for you.", "Lady, you started the insults by coming on Reddit to project your insecurities onto an innocent man making an awkward attempt at a dumb joke.

Otherwise the comment doesn't make sense.   In my head I'd have called the boss out for being an asshole.  In reality I'd have given him a confused look and then left.  I'm not confrontational.", "What\u2019s the alternative explanation?", "What did he mean by saying she looks more like UberEats than doordash, then?", "Dude it's him or the shitty partner.

Would bet money he has a receding hairline lmao", "Bruh you are literally spamming every comment. Are you the 'boss'?", "Does your neck beard itch a lot? (that is if you can grow one)", "\"huh...

Treat them as your equal, they can handle it, I promise.", "Lmao I'm a 33 yo woman. You are obviously a child who puts body image and your boss above your life partner. That's fucked up.

It would be a shame if the lovely routine you have with your husband had to change because his boss said a rude thing.
