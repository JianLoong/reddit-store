She had 2 pet cats she loved very much and I was okay with them because I didn't realize how deeply obsessed she was. The problem arose when my daughter(6f) Mia was born. We found out she was allergic to cats. Lucy refused to move or get rid of the cats because \"they were her babies and Mia can handle them.\" \n\nWhat I did next might be counted by some people as overreacting, but I kicked both her and her cats out, and got divorced. Long story short, I got full custody. Since almost everything was in my name and we had a pre-nup, she was left with practically nothing and had to move in with her parents. \n\nTwo weeks ago, I got a call from Lucy that she wanted to \"borrow\" Mia to introduce her to her new fiance and his kids. This wasn't a new thing, she always does this when she has a new boyfriend. But this was the first time that she got engaged or had a boyfriend with kids. I was worried about the kids and I found the fiance (I asked my ex's sister, she's one of the few family members on my side during the divorce) and ended up telling about how my ex values the health of her cats than the health of her own child. Another long story short, they broke up.\n\nNow everyone (family members not on my side) are telling me I an AH for ruining my ex's life again. I think I did the right thing.\n\nBut just making sure who is the AH here\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What's not believable is completely forgetting to mention this before.", "So then your answer to her should have just been \"no.\" Why all the extra effort?

Something stinks here", "Putting your kid up for adoption is such a crazy thing. \n\nGood on you that you got full custody, your ex sounds mental.\nBut I must agree with the YTAs, it's not your responsibility to creep around and warn strangers about her. I can't tell if it's truly about protecting strangers or if it's about revenge. If my wife suggested putting up our son for adoption for something like that I would probably be furious and want revenge myself.\n\nFocus on your responsibility, which is being the best dad you can, not revenge. If someone asks you for advice, you can be honest", "You aren't TA for divorcing her.

Bathing would have worked but because she would let the cats near Mia when I wasn't there the allergies would start up again.

I'm on the fence about this latest mess.", "I'm not sure.

Also, his choice to end things seems to show your ex still has the same values which drove your decisions. Nta even fkn slightly, well done you for looking out.", "I dunno. If someone was so unhinged that they favoured their pets over their child due to an allergy, I'd want to know before getting too far with them.", "She only has supervised visitation yet expected OP to allow her to take their child to introduce to fianc\u00e9 and his kids. That says the court doesn't trust her.", "Ok I know I was wrong now. And I'm not justifying myself but in my mind this is what happened.\n\nA grown up man is okay. He can handle himself and either way he's not coming in contact with my kid so no harm to her either. \n\nI was worried because she already showed she cared more about the cats than an actual child. If she was like that to her own child, what would she do to one that wasn't her own? I asked her sister what ages the kids were, because if they were older (9-10 and above) then the kids can call someone if something happens right? But when I heard 3 and 5 I got paranoid. What if the cats scratch them (the kids) accidently? Will she make them hide the scratches, what if the cats bite them? She lets the cats outside. Its pretty common in my country. We also have a large amount of strays. What if the cat got rabies while it was outside and then hurt the kids? There's a spike in rabies in my country\n\nI think I got triggered by our conversation and I know I over-reacted.", "I\u2019m glad you self reflected \ud83d\udc4d"]}
