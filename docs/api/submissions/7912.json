You don't want to expose your child to that. She inserted herself to be a godparent, then made demands. Since then, she's not done a damn thing, and your friend has. You can wait until the christening and let your sister and mom find out you want as godparents, or you can tell them ahead of time. I wouldn't simply because they will just start bullying you.\n\nShe obviously doesn't want to help and support because she's done neither. You can't count on her.

Yes, the miscarriage is really bad, but it is no reason for you to be forced to a decision to take her as a godparent. I don't know your sister, but I had a simular expirience with a friend who we ask to be somekind of godparent (we are not religios and in our country being godparent means that you have to be in church and so). She totally missed the point and thougth she could treat the child like it would be hers - I'm not saying your sister will do that, but maybe after loosing her child, she might is looking to have this child as some kind of her own\n\nYou can tell her, she is not welcome to be godmother anymore. If she is not picking up the phone, try to reach her or tell her on voicemail (as an other user already said).\n\nHope your friend will help you and be a good godparent for your child.

She had myself and her other friend supporting her. Just after she had her baby her other friend who was sharing title of GodMother with me, got pregnant. She of course then had her child and those two drifted apart.\nMy point is that some people don\u2019t have family, friends can come and go too, sure. But if someone is supporting you during your pregnancy, they\u2019re more likely to be there for you when the baby is there too. My little miss is now 7 and since she could talk has called me \u2018Mine\u2019. I have an older sister and 3 brothers but my friend is like my little sister and that\u2019s my niece. Her Dad is not in her life and my siblings are her family. She has sleepovers at my Mums house, who she calls \u2018Baka\u2019 meaning GrandMother in my Mums language. I live with my sister now and my sister will even babysit her. \nShe has a great relationship with her two Uncles and her mums parents but we are just extended family. Or not even. We are just family \ud83e\udd70 I also have two younger nephews who call her their cousin and they\u2019ve grown up together and love and are so protective of her.\nI am extremely close to my sister and if I had had kids she would have helped me raise them. But don\u2019t discount friends just because they are not blood. Sometimes those relationships can be stronger and run deeper.\nI hope you can figure this out and stay strong with your decision. You need to not be stressed whilst pregnant! Go low contact or even no contact if it gets worse. Tell your Mother you love her but you need to do what\u2019s right for you", "NTA\n\n\nSeems like you were better off being NC with her. Maybe go LC with mom too. Not exactly sure of the dynamic but seems like mom favors sister.", "NTA. Do you want her to raise your child if you die?", "NTA basically your mother bullied you into getting in touch again with your sister bully and immediately she started bullying you all over again. When you tried to put a stop to her demands your mother is telling you to put up with it and continue on with having bully sister not only in your life, but the life of your child? The godmother of your child is the one who demanded you abort your child? NO. Cut Contact, this relationship is doing you no good at all. Your mum is trying to create a happy family that is complete fantasy, it is what she wishes it could be, not what it actually is. Your mum does not have your best interests at heart. She is dreaming, not protecting you.", "nta- she does not deserve the role.", "That\u2019s exactly what I thought and she has an abundance of free time. I moved house in October and she still has never even stood foot in it. Thank you so much I definitely will!", "We were no contact for four years before I got pregnant and it was great. Half of my family is no contact with her because they seen her true colours.", "He is emotionally and mentally abusive. I mean that she is only interested in talking to me when I tell her about how he is abusing me but if I want to talk about anything else she doesn\u2019t care, almost like she gets some kind of entertainment out of it. I know that sounds extreme but given some of the things she has done to me over the years, she is really extremely ruthless. I thought she had changed and was trying but not anymore.", "Or maybe she's not interested in hearing how wonderful the man Who is abusing you is when you're in the happy period of th\u00e9 cycle of violence...\n\nI don't know if your sister is an asshole or not, but I know that trying to \"support\" \u00e0 woman Who is being abused but refuses to leave her husband can be difficult, exhausting and toxic.\n\nMaybe you should het into therapy and you definitly need to leave your asshole husband.", "I didn\u2019t mean about him it\u2019s very rare I have positive stories of him I mean like if I tell her about scans or try to talk about something to do with my house or talk about anything that is going good for me she literally doesn\u2019t care she just keeps asking about him. Most of the time I don\u2019t talk about him to anyone I think it\u2019s pointless and embarrassing but she is only interested in knowing about him. I didn\u2019t ever ask for support for my relationship either I asked for support in my pregnancy and so I wanted to know if something\u2019s normal or if she went through a certain thing or talk about my anxieties with labor or someone to come to about all the amazing things in pregnancy but she just doesn\u2019t care about any of that. It\u2019s relentless the questions and they\u2019re so inappropriate and never about my baby.", "She wants to know that you're safe. Your sister is worried about YOU and how your husband is treating you.", "If she wants to know that I am safe and is so worried why would she go behind my back and call me crazy to my boyfriend not husband, tell him that I\u2019m an emotional mess when he left me to go partying with other women when I was 20 weeks pregnant and told him he had done nothing wrong. If she was so concerned about her sister why is she enabling the abuser, no, encouraging the abuser against me. I take full responsibility for staying in the relationship and I can\u2019t blame anyone but myself for how I allowed myself to be treated I don\u2019t blame her or him I could have left day one and didn\u2019t, but don\u2019t come at me after reading my post and ever imply that my sister has ever had any good intentions for my safety. I considered that she may be a good godparent to my child and that it may be different because of things my mother was saying to me and sometimes on emotional days I half believed she might give a shit about me but she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s the same cruel person she always has been and will never change.", "You really need sole help because nobody Who abuses people can be anything good to \u00e0 child.\n\nGrow up and stop acting like a victim. You have been making shitty choices for a long time now. If you attract assholes, ask yourself why.\n\nWith everything I read on this post, ESH."]}
