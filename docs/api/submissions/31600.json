So while at the usual feasting I was receiving the usual grill down from one of my aunts.\n\nAunt: so how far are you from your job, OP?\nOP: well I\u2019m not working anymore, but I was only a mile away from my old job.\nAunt: Why did you leave then?\nOP: It wasn\u2019t a work environment conducive to good mental health?\nAunt: So! I don\u2019t like my job but I still gotta go make money!\nOP: Well I\u2019m not going to sacrifice my mental state for a couple of dollars when I don\u2019t have to. \nAunt: Well how are you going to pay your bills?\nOP: I\u2019m figuring it out, but since we\u2019re on the topic are you offering to pay them for me?\n\nAfter a round of silence, I realized that I said the last part slightly louder than intended and now everyone was staring. Some of my cousins said I should\u2019ve just brushed her off and some said that she should\u2019ve known better. I\u2019ve been out of work for almost 3 months now and I\u2019m honestly sick of having to rehash this conversation and only recently I discovered that the magic question is \u201care you going to pay my bills since you\u2019re so concerned?\u201d\n\nAITA for asking my aunt if she\u2019s going to pay my bills?\n\nETA: It was a longer conversation than what I typed but for those asking I don\u2019t need to work for money to live. I wasn\u2019t offended until she kept on asking how will I pay my bills and I told her I\u2019m getting by fine, and then asked about how I\u2019ll pay child support, and I again said I\u2019m taking care of it, and then she asked about my rent, and that\u2019s when I snapped. No I\u2019m not close to this aunt, we just see each other at family gatherings and it was just luck of the draw she was in line behind me for the food. \n\n\nEdit 2! I\u2019m out! It\u2019s been fun!

My question is why did you ask people for judgment when you were gonna get mad at everyones answer lol. Youve gotten defensive/nasty w everyone whos had a diff opinion than you. These ppls opinions dont matter dont worry about what they think. I am not judging you just wondering why you care at all.", "At this point, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re dealing drugs, doing OF, or living off of your parents. \n\nEither way, that\u2019s some juicy holiday gossip. I\u2019d have asked you too.", "YTA. I mean, this didn\u2019t sound like a grilling. It sounded like normal conversation until you took offense to the suggestion that you might need to work for money to live.", "YTA.\n\nThe reason you're having to \"rehash the conversation\" is because you made a stupid move. I'm all for getting away from shit jobs, but you had nothing lined up and, from what you're saying her, *don't* have a way to pay your bills. \n\nIt's a pretty normal question to ask someone in your situation... you're the one who lashed out. I'm guessing because you're insecure about your bad decision. And because you really *don't* have any plan.", "ESH\n\nShe should have dropped it after you told her it wasn\u2019t a good environment and changed the subject. It was rude and intrusive to ask how you were planning on paying the bills, as if you aren\u2019t acutely aware of your own financial situation. She was probably coming from a place of concern, but I personally don\u2019t think personal questions about someone\u2019s financial situation is appropriate Thanksgiving dinner conversation material. \n\nYou shut down the conversation quite rudely. It\u2019s not the content of what you said as much as how you said it. You mentioned not *intending* for it to be as loud as it was, but it was loud enough that the rest of your family sat in stunned silence, staring. \n\nI feel the worst for the other people at the table who just wanted a nice family meal on Thanksgiving. I can\u2019t imagine how uncomfortable this entire exchange must have been for them.", "ESH.\n\nOn her part, nosy in a group setting.

Right? \n\nYou kinda sold yourself as too snotty for work.", "ESH\n\nTbh both of you sound irritating af", "I don't know if you're the asshole. No tone in text and don't know how often she does this. \n\nShe's an asshole for saying \"so what\" about mental health and equating a negative impact on yours to \"I don't like my job\"\n\nFor all we know, you're selling hard drugs and you're an asshole. Or you're independently financed and you're not. \n\nFor all we know you did make a bad decision. For all we know she's the idiot that blows all her money so has to stay at a shit job.", "OP is bonkers. Never seen someone so timid to mention how they make their money while being a random on the internet, especially someone putting themselves out there looking for advice.", "YTA - this was hardly a grilling and family asking about work is pretty common conversation.", "YTA.  What a stupid hill to die on during a holiday conversation.", "YTA\n\nThis is what adults call 'conversation.'. This was not an interrogation.", "lol I\u2019ll be unpopular here but \u2026 he did say that he didn\u2019t want to suffer for a couple of dollars when he doesn\u2019t have to. The responds in a normal, non judgement conversation would be. How come? Do you have another income? Or what do you mean? \n\nIt seems that OP has another income. This could be from tons of things. Not everyone has to work for an income. Some people have income through renting houses/properties, nowadays they create a software or courses and sell them online, \u2026 there\u2019s tons of stuff besides your salary.\n\nI don\u2019t really get why people tell you that y t a because you should have had another job lined up, \u2026 that\u2019s totally not the point of this post at all.. \n\nI think aunt was trying to converse but sounded a bit bitter as well as she commented she doesn\u2019t like her job but still needs to make money. So I would go for equal share or not (depending on how she talked)", "ESH, welcome to the holidays...", "Yes, YTA. Get a job (gas station, wal mart, post office, etc) or take the heat. It's not financially wise to quit a job before you have another one lined up - that's common sense. And of course people are going to have questions on how you've been paying your bills for three months when you're unemployed. It is what it is and you made yourself the a hole here in your response.", "YTA. Why even make this post if you're just going to argue with everyone? \n\nYou're wrong.

You could just say something I\u2019m doing fine and we don\u2019t need to talk about it anymore.\n\nAunt was probably prying a bit too much, but probably trying to give you genuine advice, even if it came across assholier than you\u2019d like\n\nQuitting before lining up an out her job generally isn\u2019t a great idea, as you are finding out. Explaining your employment gap will get harder and harder. Good luck", "LMAOOO you really think you did something here, huh?\n\nYour Aunt might be a bit of a Boomer at one end of the spectrum but she's also absolutely correct. \n\nMeanwhile you're the soft child at the other end of the spectrum who's been out of work for **three months** because you chose to quit a job with *no backup plan*, AND you\u2019re responsible for providing a child with monetary support?\n\nMental health is important but so is surviving monetarily as an adult, and making sure your child is being provided for. \n\n\u201cHonestly sick of having to rehash this conversation\u201d? Maybe make fewer absolutely questionable decisions. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Also, how are you planning to pay your bills if you've been off work for 3 months. Assuming you're an adult- it's time to make practical decisions. You shouldn't have quit without having something else lined up.", "no, she may be genuinely concerned about how you\u2019ll make ends meet but the way she talks sounds more judgmental. also if you\u2019re not close w your aunt it\u2019s not very polite to ask how you\u2019ll pay your bills, and if you are close enough for her to ask this then she shouldn\u2019t be offended w how you answered.", "Yta you made a dumb decision and she was asking a question out of concern and u lashed out cause clearly ur insecure about it.", "I might get downvoted to hell but NTA and E S H at worst. You have no reason to answer them anything, especially when they are not your parent and keep integrating you about your work.\n\nIt\u2019s common for people to leave work for their welfare or looking for a better opportunity. You also do not have to share where your income comes from, to your Aunt or this sub. It could be inheritance, stock or something else, either way passive income is a good enough answer. Your Aunt is insensitive and being aggressive.\n\nThe only part that you are wrong is you shouldn\u2019t have said if she\u2019s going to pay your bill, it\u2019s weird and out of context. Simply say non of your business or I\u2019m not interested in this conversation will paint you in a much better light.\n\nEdit: for context of why he\u2019s disclosing his income. Suppose he had an inheritance, lottery or stock, it not something that people might want to share with their relatives, so avoid people getting greedy or something else, he also don\u2019t have to share it in this sub to avoid someone he knows to find out or judge him on the wrong thing. Either way I think it\u2019s irrelevant to the question.", "NTA\n\nYou gracefully deflected the topic twice and had to drop a hard hint. Intentional or not for volume, Auntie needs to learn from this that not every topic is fair game with family.\n\nAlso, I don't care who you are. Unless you are my personal lawyer or account manager NO ONE gets my Financials spelled out in Big Crayon. Period. \n\nAlso also, \"no\" is a complete sentence and needs respected.\n\nAll these yuckleheads need to understand that using adult words like \"I'm concerned about your situation because I don't understand\" goes way farther than other compositions.", "I think a lot of it depends on tone, tbh. \n\nESH", "NTA. Unless they are feeding, fucking or financing you, it ain't nobody's business but yours. And people on here saying you're the asshole are the same ones minding everyone else's business.", "NTA - All of her questions were rude and she kept pushing.  Glad you embarassed her, maybe now she will think twice about being nosy.", "NYA lol", "Going against the grain here, but NTA. She crossed the line as soon as she went as far as asking \u201cwell how are you paying your bills?\u201d That\u2019s rude and invasive. Could your response have been nicer? Sure. But she fired the first shots.", "ESH\n\nShe sucks for pushing the issue and making light of your mental health. That\u2019s no laughing matter, and just because her generation doesn\u2019t value it more than a dollar doesn\u2019t mean others can\u2019t.\n\nHowever, the way you shut her down was a bit harsh at a family gathering. Had she come visiting by herself and made those remarks pointedly, then you would have been within your rights to let her have it. However, at a family gathering, she may just be trying to make small talk and failing. So I would have still shut her down, but done so differently.\n\nI\u2019d apologize for the public chastisement of her, but also let her know that your mental health is important and you value it, and that you\u2019d like to have that respected.", "I'm going to say NTA. I don't think people understand how an aunt you barely see really doesn't need to dive into your personal finances. She obviously has never been told to mind her own business.\n\nMy husband took a job that is 6 figures but he's gone alot, basically home for about 12-24 hours and gone for 24-48 hours all the time. \n\nHis uncle, that we were not close with, decided he would tell my husband it was a bad idea and that there's a high rate of divorce in his line of work and so on and so forth. And it happened at every gathering we would see him which was basically just Christmas if we could make the gathering. I wanted to ask every single time if he was going to pay our bills so DH could quit his job.\n\n10 years later we are still happily married paying our bills and going on trips. I'm also independent so his job gives me down time alone like tonight.... with my dogs.... and cats\n\nOh and he would also complain about anything that had to do with my husband's job that \"affected\" him. DH works as a conductor and will actually blow the train horn just a little extra, not beyond what they are allowed but on the edge, right by where his uncle lives if he's assigned there because he complains about it every time we see him.", "NTA, but it was kinda rude. I hate when family dosen't stop asking, but it was an unessesary comment", "NTA. This is an inappropriate line of questions for an adult person. Your edit that this conversation went on longer than initially indicated makes a difference. Unless your aunt is already your default fall-back, or is in a position to offer you support, it\u2019s not really her business. \n\nI would also point out her response to your reason for quitting was very judgmental and already rubbed me the wrong way. So if that\u2019s the tone in which the conversation continued, I would have shut it down too.", "NTA\n\nI see all the YYA and \u201cget a job\u201d answers, and I definitely think they are all acting just like your aunt. \n\nYou stated to her that you have your financial obligations covered. That is all she (and anyone else) need to know. More, honestly. Your financial arrangements aren\u2019t their business (or anyone else\u2019s business), unless they are paying your bills. \n\nIt was rude of her to press the issue.", "Why is it your aunts business how you\u2019re making money? Are you paying her bills or is it going into her bank account? No. That\u2019s rude and intrusive. NTA.", "I mean, I suppose all the YTA votes are wondering how you're paying your bills, but in reality, your aunt's line of questioning was rude AF, so NTA IMO.", "Yta\n\nShe showed concern and asked a legitimate question that anyone having this conversation with you would ask.", "Alas, so richly deserved, but, yeah, probably not the place or time for sarcasm.", "ESH. I would say you just kind of sound like an asshole generally from your comments, and the way you spoke to your aunt was pretty rude and unnecessary. Adults should have more patience than that, especially at a family gathering. \n\nBUT everyone saying you \"made a dumb decision\" and that it's \"not financially wise\" is making an unjustified assumption. Maybe you don't need a job because of your \"passive income\". Maybe what you did was a personal choice that had no effect on your ability to sustain yourself, which is exactly what you claim in the comments. \n\nOP doesn't owe it to the aunt to explain that to her. Maybe she doesn't want anyone to know. Still TA because of how you handled it, but the aunt was prying, not \"concerned\". What's the point of asking how someone is going to live without a job if you're not going to help?", "NTA, if you shut her up then it worked.", "NTA. Everyone who says you are probably gives unsolicited advice and justifies it as \"caring\". Your aunt stuck her nose in business and you took it out \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "NTA.  She should have minded her own business.  Who invited her to give you advice?", "NTA\n\nPeople are nosey af\n\nI really don't care if it's the holidays or not\n\nDon't ask stupidly invasive questions, if you don't want a very embarrassing answer \n\nI am child free for both medical reasons (medications) and choice, and when telling people I was choosing to be child free due to medications, people started telling me, unsolicited, to just stop the medication?\n\nNo?  Did I ask your opinion?  Did the fact that I look MASSIVELY uncomfortable with this entire subject not give you a clue to back off?\n\nI've started telling people I'm infertile instead\n\nWhich has shut down that conversation in its tracks, and makes them feel bad\n\nAnd I don't feel bad about it\n\nAlso, I'm not really lying;  not anymore;  I'm getting a medically necessary hysterectomy within the next 6 months or so, but I started doing this years ago; so when I started doing it?  Straight up lie\n\nStill don't feel bad about how mortified people would look when I would look them in the eye and say that, either \n\nMy point here;  people need to stop feeling entitled to ask all kinds of invasive questions\n\nIt's cool to ask about jobs, but if the person looks visibly uncomfortable, or you have to start probing for information, drop it\n\nAnd as far as asking about starting a family/getting engaged/getting married? \n\nJust don't \n\nIf people want to talk about that, they will\n\nEta clarifying information", "I\u2019m kind of shocked by these comments. OP\u2019s financial situation is none of her business, regardless of its intention. It\u2019s an inappropriate and invasive question, ESPECIALLY by someone you are not close to. If OP is not concerned about paying bills, why is she so concerned? She didn\u2019t let it go and get the clear hint when OP stated they had it taken care of. IMO it was a warranted response and quite clever.\n\nEdit: NTA", "YTA", "YTA. That comment is uncalled for. \u201c I\u2019m figuring it out\u201d is enough. I mean how are you going to pay bills is a valid question esp if you don\u2019t have a job. \n\nIn this kind of gatherings. I choose my battle. There\u2019s a lot of topics and comments you\u2019ll get apart from your job.", "NTA. Incredible how people normalize these questions just because they are asked during family events. If it was out of concern, there would be no comment such as:\n\n**\"So! I don\u2019t like my job but I still gotta go make money!\"**", "People are fucking weird on here to think it\u2019s ok to ask a GROWN ADULT how they\u2019re managing their finances like what?? Ask once and if someone steers the topic away, take the damn hint and drop it or veer off. OP you\u2019re NTA. I say we normalize redirecting and asking how the OTHER person is making their finances. How is the mistress doing, aunt Clarice? How\u2019s your felon husband doing, uncle Eric? Like how far is too far when delving into someone\u2019s business?", "Going to be the oddball out here and say NTA. I def think it\u2019s time we stop giving older folks a pass to say whatever they want just because they\u2019ve \u201cearned it\u201d. You don\u2019t talk to this person regularly, this person doesn\u2019t check on, and quite frankly speaking about personal finances in that setting was incredible rude. Could you have shut the conversation down a different way? Absolutely. But you chose your words the way she chose hers and your response to her interrogation wasn\u2019t entirely unwarranted. I\u2019d probably say that same thing to a blood related stranger questioning my life path too.", "NTA. Your aunt was out of line, nosy and judgmental. She hates her job and seems put out that you left your job and still have income to support yourself while you figure it out.\n\nAlso - your clapback was perfect. I saw nothing wrong with it after her comment. She should\u2019ve dropped it the moment you explained why you left your job.\n\nI found your clapback funny actually. That she had egg on her face after is on her for asking about finances - I mean if she wasn\u2019t going to pitch in, WHY WAS SHE ASKING?! \n\nNTA and I don\u2019t understand all the people claiming you are.", "YTA. You have a child. You have a responsibility to provide for a whole person that you created. Perfectly valid for your aunt to question your decision making skills when you quit your job. You sound like a deadbeat trying to get the court to lower your child support payment because you\u2019re \u201cunemployed.\u201d", "NTA\n\nThat was an inappropriate choice of questioning on her end. Discussing money during dinner is gauche.", "NTA it sounds like you were joking around while pointing out that she was pushing the subject too far. Tbh this was the funniest thing I read in a second, sorry the situation got awkward op", "YTA. She's making conversation and asking a perfectly legitimate question of someone who quit their job. You were totally rude.", "You\u2019re fucking cringe -get a job", "yta. it sounds like a normal family conversation that you took offense too.", "NTA.  Fair question, considering how far into your business she was.", "NTA\n\nIt really should\u2019ve just ended with your aunt saying, \u201cGlad you\u2019re taking care of yourself.\u201d Maybe then following up with questions about your future and/or taking the hint you weren\u2019t interested in the topic. Just because she\u2019s able to push her health aside for her job doesn\u2019t mean everybody can. Sure, there were nicer ways to have said it, but I think dismissing your mental health warrants a little bit of sass.", "NTA\n\nYeah, questions about jobs are normal convo. However, she could have just stopped there and wished you luck or something. The conversation ended though when she decided to be condescending, and let's not pretend she wasn't. Time to come down from the high horse crusade.", "YTA. And get a job.", "NTA. Very funny though", "YTA.\n\nYou could have easily and politely ended the conversation, but you chose to escalate. Did it ever occur to you that your aunt might have just been expressing concern? Tell her you have it covered. Redirect. Thank her for caring. \n\nBut nooooooo. You want drama. Yeah, you\u2019re the ass.", "YTA sorry but your aunt sounded concerned. Plus, keep in mind, I'm betting you're significantly younger than her? Quitting due to mental health wasn't really a thing until recently. Before now, it was just you have a job that pays the bills so you deal. A lot of people struggle with the concept of mental health being a real issue. Think of all the people who go \"you're depressed? But you have money and it's sunny outside! Go enjoy the sun, that will cheer you up\". I have had plenty of family that I see 1-2x a year ask me about my past year and what I'm doing and such. When I've been between jobs it's always a \"oh, what happened\" followed by a \"now what?\" It's a normal conversation....", "Yta", "YTA, we are adults now it shouldn't matter if a place isn't conductive for your mental health, that's an issue you need to handle. I say that because 1, this conversation doesn't sound like a grilling, it sounds like a normal auntie conversation you took too personally. 2, if you took a totally normal conversation like that so personally, no wonder you couldn't stay at your job. Instead of quitting your job, you should have sought out therapy or at least had another job lined up so you could pay your bills. I used to get so offended when my mom used to tell me it's time to be an adult and handle my shit like an adult, but now I realize how true that is. Work is work, Nobody is going to hold your hand or kiss your booboos, nobody will care or notice if you're having a hard day, you just need to keep putting one foot infront of the other and focus on you and what you need to do. Make sure you're surrounded by good people and if not make sure you're a good person to be around yourself.  If you want something good for your mental health, have a routine ready for destressing when you get home, practice breathing routines, don't quit when things get hard. That sets a pattern that's extremly hard to break, and makes others view you as weak and a quitter. Snapping back a nasty \" are you gonna pay my bills\" to somebody just asking from a place of concern makes you the AH.", "NTA - She didn't need to ask how you are going to pay your bills.  You set a boundary and she respected it.  Some people need to think before they speak.", "NTA- your money situation is none of her business.", "The amount of supremely upvoted comments saying YTA tells me everyone on reddit has picture-perfect sitcom families. Judging by the aunt's snark, I'm betting you're generously underselling how rude she was, because you feel bad for embarrassing her. Especially considering you unintentionally raised your voice, so you were likely getting increasingly frustrated.\n\nIt is strange and rude to continue to press someone over their personal finances over Thanksgiving dinner. Period. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. The only people who are saying \"YTA\" are people like your aunt. I wouldn't take any notice.", "YTA - Mostly I think saying \"are you going to pay my bills since you're so concerned\" is nonsense. If someone is demanding you should do something that will cost you time, money or effort and you aren't interested then you say why don't you do it if you're so concerned. In my mind that totally works.\n\nBut in your context it feels more like lashing out cause it hit a nerve.", "NTA. The only people whose business it is where your money comes from are those who pay your bills or depend on you to pay them. Everyone else can kick rocks.", "Honestly, YTA. \n\nI understand absolutely everything that went into you ultimately answering the way you did as you felt like she was needling you for no reason. I get that. I\u2019m not passing judgment on her as I wasn\u2019t there and I can\u2019t tell you if she was prying or saying it out of concern. All I can say is that you were louder than you wanted to be, and you responded in a way that stopped you down to the level you are accusing her of. \n\nYou could have responded far more politely. \n\n\u201cAunt Busy-Body, I am not struggling right now. I appreciate your concern, but my finances are not your business nor is it a subject I am interested in discussing during the holiday. I am curious, the mashed potatoes taste different than they did last year\u2026 what did you do differently?\u201d\n\nYou honestly need to learn that sometimes you should take the high road.

YTA.", "YTA adults work to pay bills, I\u2019d be concerned with my family member and ask for more info too if they said what you did to me.

Which is ok but also would be concerning to any family member who cares about you.", "Real question though, how do you pay your bills ? Because if you are living with your parents then you deserve every piece of grilling you get.", "YTA most holiday conversations follow the same opening topics: spouse/kids/health/work.

Op oviously doesn't want to talk about their source of income, but it doesn't have to be work.", "Sounds like MLM or OF by OPs cageyness", "False equivalency.\n\nA golden retriever is a dog.\nAn income is not a job. \nI call my source of income exactly that, a source of income. Some call it passive income.", "What?", "I also think it's fake. At least, I hope so. OP is completely ridiculous with a terrible attitude.", "I didn\u2019t yell. I feel like everyone has this jazz record scratching, birds flying from trees as an echo rings out, type scenario. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 I just spoke louder than normal and honestly if I heard someone say \u201care you gonna pay my bills?\u201d I\u2019d probably perk up too \ud83d\ude02", "Not for me, I can pay my bills without selling my body, brothel boy.", "Please go back and read some comments. OP is unemployed but has income. So his bills are paid, including child support, but he doesn\u2019t actually have to go to a would sucking job.", "Not like their opinion actually mattered to begin with, the ones that talk to me outside of holidays know me and the rest are kinda like npcs", "Not in my family's either honestly.\n\nIf pressing for answers is normal honestly I'm glad my family is abnormal.", "They clearly don't \n\nOp said in another comment that they don't need to work;  \n\nThat they are annoyed, because they DONT need to work, they have the money situation taken care of and that's why they snapped at their aunt \n\nBecause their aunt kept pushing after they said their finances were taken care of\n\nThe only one projecting here is you bud", "True dat", "Again, she doesn\u2019t know me, wildly invasive line of questioning when we only talk 3 days out of 365.", "And plenty of people, unlike yourself, have soul sucking jobs that don\u2019t allow them any of the things you mentioned including work life balance. Like have you never been to r/antiwork or r/workreform JFC", "Replying to someone's questions is engaging. OP could have said they don't want to discuss their finances or even \"I've got it handled\". OP chose to lie and ask for money, and somehow that's less tacky than asking your loved one if they're going to have a roof over their head and food in their belly in the near future.", "Weird determination since I am speaking from personal experience (as the child) but sure buddy", "You have not. You sound exhausting.", "While \"none of your business\" is AN answer, it doesn't answer the question. But since you need it phrased a certain way...\n\nInfo: How are you paying your bills without a job?\n\nAnd no, I am not contributing.", "You've been asked repeatedly how you can pay your bills without having to work. I'm not concerned--couldn't give a shit, really--but we're all curious, and it bears on the judgment. Would you, even vaguely, answer the question? Or at least engage honestly with those doing so?", "Why does concern have to be in the form money or helping you out?    \n\nWhy can\u2019t she just be concerned? Your attitude is shit. YTA. Good thing she doesn\u2019t have to see you but once a year.", ">buffalobillsgirl76\n\nWell yeah, he doesn't have to, and he clearly doesn't want to. But there are ways of ignoring/brushing it off without making him sound more suspicious. Even if his family is nosy and doesn't care about him, I don't think that's cause for him to be snippy and passive-aggressive. Sometimes you just have to smile and be polite.", "This! Unemployment or some kind of government assistance. He doesn\u2019t want but to get a job because he doesn\u2019t want to pay child support. Also he knows that if he owns up to government assistance as his \u201cpassive income\u201d people will be jumping on his back.", "They told me they invested in a friend's business that's going very well.", "Then why engage on the topic at all? Why tell them you're unsure when you're not? This could have easily been remedied by just saying you don't discuss your finances instead of lying, knowing where this is going. I can see why so many come at you with a condescending attitude tbh.", "I mean I get that but OP is being so weird about answering the question", "Or involves a website for \u201csugar\u201d connections.  Honestly, any semblance of sympathy went by the wayside when the OP just up and quit cuz of their \u201cmental health\u201d.  Just can\u2019t take it serious behind that point when thinking of having to support a child.  As my grandma would\u2019ve said \u201csuck it up, buttercup\u201d.", "That's my bad I misread and thought you said yell rather than louder than intended. I'll put my hands up to that. \n\nI still stand by my comment though, there are nicer ways to handle it, sure she didn't handle it well and was overstepping. But this is an AITA post so I'm going to stick with ESH. Just because she's being a dick doesn't mean you have to be.", "Who calls their family or anyone an npc, you do realize everyone you talk to has a life and a mind and you are not the main character right?", "Lol yeah I didn't ur the one making shit up", "Then tell her that. Don't just lie and ask for money.", "No, I don\u2019t spend my time in a subreddit called \u201canti work\u201d lol. When every single person (all unbiased strangers at that) is telling you the same thing, and you are the only one continuing to defend yourself, who do you think is right", ">OP could have said they don't want to discuss their finances or even \"I've got it handled\".\n\nThey answered twice that they're taking care of their bills and child support, she didn't need to ask about rent too. The first 2 answers should have been enough to make her realize that the conversation was not appropriate. She wasn't offering solutions, she was basically telling OP that they should sacrifice their mental health for money and questioned their finances repeatedly. That didn't sound like concern to me, more like family gossip fodder.", "So you really have no clue then. Because from what you posted above, that\u2019s not how it works.\n\nOh, and don\u2019t be sexist. Women can easily be the dirt bag as well and not pay child support to the father.", "As the child yes sure. Not as the parent going through these cases, but the one being ferried around that everyone is fighting over.", "Which ones did I miss? I\u2019m pretty sure I got them all but in case I didn\u2019t just tag or repost", "Answer: passive income.", "Passive income. I\u2019ve engaged for what I think to be honestly and sincerely. Point out to me who has actually asked the question besides you and one other. Every else just alluded to some statement to make me just gone out and say it", "That's how you get this year after year... do what OP did once sometimes twice then you have happy holidays because youre not being questioned.", "Suspicious.", "How would you feel if we all asked you to spell out your Financials in public? I mean, are you really skipping the Avocado toast? Just give us a spreadsheet... or your tax bracket. C'MON!! It'll be fun!!", "Because they don't want to answer it, it's pretty clear from the post?", "Fair enough. Ty", "Everyone does indeed have a life, but I don\u2019t go around trying to look into their finances unless they ask me to, or owe me money.", "How so?\n\nYou know, I'm not wasting my time arguing with someone whose opinion means literally nothing to me\n\nI know nothing about you, the information I used is all in the post, or in the comments, if you bothered to read \n\nI'm done here\n\nHave a nice night", "I literally don't know why you are being down voted right now \n\nCourts determine child support based on income, sure \n\nBut if you are able to continue to pay other things without an income, judges (at least a competent one) will throw away any petition to lower child support, because if you can pay your other bills, you can pay your child support, too\n\nAs far as this comment, I don't see it as being bitter\n\nI see it as why would you put a kid through what you went through?  \n\nYou know it sucks, you aren't going to do it \n\nJust because your relationship with your kids mother didn't happen to work out doesn't mean you are a crappy parent, or a dead beat parent, like people are making it out to be, and its shitty that people are trying to claim that \n\nWe don't have the whole story \n\nAs far as the question asked\n\nIf you see your aunt twice a year it's none of her damn business;  your bills are paid, that's all she needs to know", ".....your attitude is weird \n\n\nYou are jealous of your kid being used as a weapon?", "Literally every single one asking how you\u2019re paying your bills.", "You did not answer anything. We all know why you haven\u2019t, we just want you to be honest with yourself.", "OP, if you are uncomfortable sharing your finances, then you don't have to. That being said, if you want people to help you make a judgement call we need a bit more info. The answer passive income is vague and could be anything from a few cents of interest from your bank account, to day trading and investing. That's a wide range when it comes to finances and definitely makes a difference.", "Sounds like you are getting out of paying child support", "Wow, you managed to, again, answer the question without actually answering the question. Passive income?", "Might also not get invites if this is how you treat everyone in your life.", "My theory is they're secretly hopeful that someone will take them up on the offer and give OP cash.", "Thank you! Weird comments here!", "Nobody asked except the guy below, David, and one other.", "Why haven\u2019t I?", "How does that alter anything? I pay all my own bills, live alone, and don\u2019t ask anyone for anything.", "Honestly, it doesn\u2019t. Passive income could be a few cents, it could be thousands of dollars, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s paying their bills. That\u2019s all we need to know. \n\nHowever, the overall way in which they are interacting in the comments kind of makes me think they tend to get snippy about this subject in general", "Name checks out", "Now they owe you their personal financial details? They pay their child support. I've literally been in this situation, courts take investments and passive income into account. It was none of this distant relative's business, it's none of your business, and in no way does the answer about his income change the vote. He gave polite answers that clearly implied a subject change was in order, it was ignored, and then he told auntie to mind her own damn business. Fair enough, no? You wouldn't react the same?"]}
