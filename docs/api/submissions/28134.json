I'm sorry you've had a falling out recently, that sucks.\n\nIf I were in your position, I would ask Mr. Husband to speak with his mother, about this trip and asking/confirming availability for future trips.\n\nGood luck, I hope you have an easy delivery and a super happy healthy babe!", "NTA. My friends had a baby during the first 3 months of covid being a thing. They couldn't have any family fly in from another continent to help and the government where I lived asked people to responsibly bubble. They picked my partner and I because we follow rules. The bubble rule was that you can only socialize within your bubble and no one else, no exceptions. They knew they were safe with us. They kept their newborn away from everyone for months afterwards. This is no different. \n\nYou're the parent and you get to decide the risks you want to expose your kid and family to. Considering the covid cases rising and the flu being a tough one this year, I think being cautious is the right move. This isn't even about being petty or resentful of the past but is actually about your kid. As long as your husband conveys that this is entirely about the baby's health and safety, any human being who cares would understand. \n\nAlso, no one is ever entitled to meet your kid. Ever. You get to decide that. They didn't even have the decency to ask and just booked this trip as if they are entitled to seeing your child. \n\nHave him tell them you'd be happy for them to visit 3 months after you give birth. Or you can zoom or FaceTime them.", "NTA. They made plans without consulting you. That's bad enough when it's someone you're on good terms with. They don't need to be anywhere near you.\n\n>They just selfishly did what they want.\n\nThat sums it up.", "NTA \n\nCongratulations on soon becoming a mom! \n\nYou are being very reasonable in setting boundaries regarding the health, safety and well-being of your baby and of you two as a couple and new parents.\n\nStand firm on that boundary. \n\nThis is your husband's family of birth. Let him handle them on both your behalf. He needs to let his l family know that their plan will not work for you soon-to-be three. And either tell them to re-book for three months later, or to wait until he invites them down. \n\nGood luck & take care of yourself and each other.", "It's crazy to me that people can plan a flight, go over to a different country/state, without even knowing if they will be welcome. And that on the best of terms. I don't even go out of my house, if I don't know for certain I'll welcome at my best friend house. NTA", "NTA. Just focus on keeping yourself and your baby safe. But also keep your husband to account, if he is still talking to them and repeatedly asks you if you're sure about them not coming to see you, then that's a sign that he isn't going to support you with them. But if he only asked once, then that's a good sign.", "Nta about the baby (about their low immune system those whom arentthe mom and dad must avoid kissing them on face stuff like that. Also after 3weeks you can go out w/ them. Still depend of the child tho).\n\n You blocked your in law bc they didnt took your husband side (idk what bil did) and then complain about them not asking you... While i get wanting the last moment of your pregnancy beein peacefull you should talk to you mil and not let resentment build.\n\nI wish you a smooth childbirth and a healthy baby.

What a ridiculous excuse you have, that it's not good for the baby. Be honest, admit it, you just want to be difficult and mean. It's not like they're taking the baby, it's just a visit.

You don't have to see them. End of discussion. Let them waste their time and money. Tell your husband you will not see them, not even once. Nor will your baby.

They won't get anywhere near you.\n\nIf they turn up at your house, they get immediately told to leave. If they refuse, call the police.

Call the police from that room.\n\nYou are the one undergoing one of the most dangerous medical procedures. Your body will still be recovering. And your baby will have no immune system to defend itself. What you say goes. Especially with people who have shown such extreme lack of morals and respect. They don't get to make these decisions. They have no right. Show them that their bullying will not work, or they'll just default to bullying you for the rest of your life.\n\nIf your husband allows these people to invade your space and jeopardise your health and your baby's, then he isn't safe to be around. He's either with you, or against you. There is no in between.", "NTA. Newborns are where mom is.

It\u2019s not your job to do honey. \nStay firm. I don\u2019t want to see anyone either, I don\u2019t like people in general but pp I was just happy to be cared for and caring for baby just with my midwife, husband and I. I didn\u2019t get the ugly sweating or else but still I was recovering from being a stupid donkey not wanting any pain meds. I was starved because the hospital had no food for us ( holidays with a planed induction soooo I was hangry). \nYour husband should handle them. If he doesn\u2019t, unblock them, say what you have to say and block them again. You can tell the hospital no visitors allowed.

I want them to meet baby. just when the baby has a stronger immune system, like after 2-3months. Not like right after I squeezed him out of my body.

It is extremely unlikely anyone very ill would visit the baby. You are paranoid. You're pregnant, emotional, and not being rational. Don't drive a wedge between your husband and his parents. A man doesn't thrive in that position, and he'll either resentfully choose you, or choose the parents.

She\u2019s already going to be not feeling \ud83d\udcafand having to deal with in-laws ? Nope I\u2019d say no too. These days with many strains of sickness on the go I don\u2019t blame her .

MIL is lucky to have 1 good son out of her 3. I will do everything in my power to keep her away from my baby til he has a strong immune system to ward off germs AND her bad vibes.
