You don\u2019t change the venue just because a guest finds it inconvenient. MIL needs to figure out if she wants to see her grandchildren badly enough. And your husband needs to start standing up to her and treating you like a partner. Does she manipulate him like this often?", "NTA. Sounds like your husband isn't supporting you in this, and that is a problem.  He wants the party at home but is he willing to clean everything? Cook everything? Do everything needed to pull it off? \n\nI'm guessing not.  More importantly, why isn't he standing up to his mother on your behalf? That's a question that might be worth asking.\n\nHope the party at your mother's is beautiful.", "NTA. Why reward his difficult mother and punish you and your mom? He needs to do what is right.

You have your hands full by the sound of it.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your mother has already made plans. Why should they be cancelled because MIL doesn't want to go? You invite people, they either come or they don't. I'll never understand why others think that if a specific person can't be there, for no good reason really, that all the plans should change. Does your husband not know his mother is a problem? Even if he doesn't, the plans have been made.", "Nta, if he's so insistent,  he can do literally all the work.

As long as she is happy at your mother's home, there shouldn't be a problem. It shouldn't matter to your In-laws where the party is.\n\nThey should just be there for your daughter. Instead they're refusing because of some petty bs.", "NTA. MIL is simply being childish and to suddenly change plans to cater to *her* stupid hang up would be a bad idea. This is an opportunity for you and your husband to set the tone with MIL that things regarding your children do not revolve around *her* and if she doesn't like it, that's not really your problem. She can act like an adult and go to the party for the sake of your daughter. and if she's unwilling to do that, so be it.", "NTA- this is the part where families need to learn to suck it up buttercup.

He can host?", "NTA: Your Husband needs to be talking to his judgmental mother about her attitude, not putting pressure on you.

It's his mom, but you are his partner and he also has three kids. He has more responsibility towards you and your kids. Sometimes such conversations are tough but they need to happen. I don't see that any of his family (or him, even though you say he's messy and he has to be aware of it) offered to clean/ cook/ decorate to help you out or host themselves.

He could have some sort of mild executive dsfunction or undiagnosed ADHD. Or as another commenter said, they just have different standards, and what embarrasses the wife doesn't embarrass her husband. Heck, for all we know her cleaning standards could be completely unreasonable, and he does a fine job, she just doesn't think it's good enough.
