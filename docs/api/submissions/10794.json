Initially I travelled to work from my parent\u2019s place every day but they stay really far away and the journey one way would take about 1.5 hours due to heavy traffic. Eventually the 3 hour round trip everyday broke me and I moved closer to the city so that I wouldn\u2019t have to get up at 5am everyday. I also have a hybrid work schedule where I wfo Mon - Wed and then wfh Thu -Fri. I come back to my parents place every Thursday night and usually leave Saturday night after dinner. However, I\u2019m not able to spend every weekend with them as sometimes I\u2019d like to go out with my friends in the city or to short getaways. Despite that, I still try my best to come home every Thursday. If I have an outing planned with my friends on Saturday, I\u2019ll leave their place Friday night or Saturday morning. My mum gets upset whenever I do this and becomes very passive aggressive and sarcastic when I tell her that I have to leave early. As an example, I told my parents today that I would be leaving tomorrow morning to go to a convention with my friends in the city. My mum proceeded to go on her phone and google that convention, claiming that there is no such convention taking place (but it is and I already bought tickets). Basically she\u2019s trying to accuse me of lying. Which is ridiculous because I don\u2019t think I need a valid reason every time for why I won\u2019t be coming back or when I do have to leave early. Sometimes I would like to just stay in my apartment during the weekends and do house chores but that\u2019s not a valid reason that they would accept for not visiting. It\u2019s making me very stressed. It doesn\u2019t matter how long I stayed last weekend or that it\u2019s the first time in a month that I\u2019m not coming back, they always claim that I am \u201cmaking excuses\u201d for not visiting them. I don\u2019t think they realise how much of an effort I\u2019m making. I drive 1 hour each way every Thursday to their house and had to skip a bunch of outings with my friends to keep them happy. It\u2019s also not like we do anything when I\u2019m home. They don\u2019t go out ever, and we don\u2019t hang out as a family. My parents are off doing their own thing during the day and we only gather together during dinner time. I understand that my parents miss me as I\u2019m not home as much as I used to be but I would also like to live my own life too without feeling guilty about it.", "created_utc": 1677241527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11aq71e/aita_for_not_spending_every_weekend_with_my/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lot of people are married with kids of their own at this point, and see their parents a lot less.  \nWe live within a mile of my in-laws, and yet my partner sees his parents about once a month.\n\nYou really need to put your foot down and cut back on how often you see them.  Tell them you cannot work from home anymore so you need to be in the city from Sunday Evening to Saturday Morning.

You're an adult with your own life who shouldn't feel obligated to spend all your free time with your parents. It's not healthy.  They are not going to like it and you might have to ignore them for a while, but you need to stop this routine now. Just be prepared for then to try and guilt and shame you, but don't let them.

I would love to see her more often, but we raised a strong independent woman who is doing the same for her children. It's probably harder on you since you're an only child. Can you face time them?

Maybe they will accept once a month visiting if that works for your schedule.", "I think that is simply how she has always gotten her way with you or qnybody, of course it ia rough when you have empty nest syndrome, but she should be proud of you and be happy for raising an independant young woman, not try to guilt trip her\nShe could simply have saidd I miss having you around and would love it if we could see eachother and do ath together once a week or biweekly sounds different or?", "It's 10x easier for a guy. I first used excuses that I needed to work the weekend. That slowly got them used to me not being in the house all the time.

My parents had unreasonable expectations too, in terms of visiting what they saw as my real 'home' (their home), although not as intense as yours. Even when I got married. I'm 36 now and I found that not overexplaining my decisions has really helped with boundaries. \n\nFor example, 'why can't you come over this weekend, we never see you!?'. I used to feel like I had to explain myself and justify my actions. Now I just respond with something like 'I'm busy this weekend. We can organise a lunch in a few weeks', and I just leave it at that with no room for negotiation. \n\nGood luck, it's really hard when you're enmeshed like this and your parents use guilt and manipulation because they can't let you go. Be strong!", "NTA. You have your own life to live. That's the point of raising your children to adulthood, so they can go off and live their life. \n\nI live about 1.5 hours from my mom and we see each other about once a month for a weekend. When I was in college, 5 times a year. Don't feel guilty living your life.", "NTA live your own life it's up to them to fill their own voids in their lives. The whole point of raising a child is to make them independent. Not to emotionally blackmail you each time you don't want to crawl up their asses.\n\nYou see your parents more than a lot of people even speak to theurs once they move out and establish themselves as an adult. They should be grateful you go out of your way bc technically you owe them nothing.", "NTA", "NTA. Visiting family can be lovely, but you aren't visiting them just to see them. You're trying to avoid the mess they make when you want to do literally anything else.\n\nGuilt trips and sulking are to manipulate your emotions and make you do what they want, so you're going to need to establish boundaries and consequences when they stomp on those boundaries. As an example, if you tell them your plans to leave early and they start some passive aggressive nonsense? Say you will leave if you can't enjoy the time you do have together...and then follow through. Recommend you cut the visits down once a month, too. Might be helpful to getting the new normal established.", "NTA\n\nI support your decision and think that you're doing the right thing. You're an adult, and your parents need to take a chill pill, and if they're scared of the empty nest raising problems / mom's being way too controlling, then for me that would be a \"you problem\", and let them handle it by their own means instead of trying to change their mind.\n\nHowever, if I can give you a piece of advice, is to enforce your own boundaries. Tell your parents that you have decided that you want to have a life, and you won'd be going back those many times, without any explanation or reasoning involved. And if they start calling you liar again and what not, just ignore and proceed. Pretty sure that an outing with friends will clear any doubt you might have after such a discussion.", "So NTA.....you love and care for your parents, that is commendable.  But you need to have a life and enjoy your youth.  I'm a Mom of an only daughter, she is 19 and does still live at home.  She does college courses online and works part-time.  Even living in the same household, she has a complete living space upstairs with her own bathroom, I don't see her every day.  She goes out quite often with friends and comes home late after my husband and I have gone to bed.  I love that she is living her best life, being young spending time doing things she enjoys.  If your parents truly love you, as I'm sure they do, they should understand you need to be independent and live your best life.\n\nPlease have a long talk with them and even if they don't understand, take time for YOU!!\n\nGood Luck......definitely not AH", "NTA - to be honest a few years ago I could have written your post, for me it started before I moved out, when I mentioned moving my Mom gave me a guilt trip that me moving out was saying they were bad parents, then when I moved out they (well Mom) expected me to visit every day, stay over at least twice a week and spend all weekends there. I had some counselling for other reasons and that helped me put up some boundaries with my family, maybe that could be something you try? It's not easy but I gradually started visiting less, at the beginning there was lots of guilt trips and sulking but when I stood my ground this has lessened, I still see them 4 times a week but it's usually a flying visit. \n\nI'll tell you something that I wish someone had said to me when I was in your shoes- you are 27, you should live your life for you. Your parents have lived their own lives and You are not responsible for their feelings or loneliness, you are at a time in your life when you need to build a life for yourself, in years to come you aren't going to look back and treasure memories of sitting around every weekend to keep your parents happy but you could look back at good memories and friendships you made. The guilt fades when the fun and relaxation come back into your life", "How are you supposed to create a life for yourself if you are so focused on your parents?", "NTA. My son is 28 and lives 2 hours away. I see him 3 or 4 times a year as he has his own life to live. I miss him loads but he owes me nothing. My job as his mum was to bring him up to be well adjusted and independent. This proves I\u2019ve succeeded.", "NTA - different families have different 'normals', some see each other every Christmas, others every week. A healthy family is one you can pop in and out and always feel supported and not guilty about doing your own thing- they want the best for YOU. \n\nI am super close to my family (live in the same village by choice) some weeks I see them multiple times, then when I'm busy with life I can go a month or more not seeing them. Never do they make me feel bad about it or interrogate me about what I'm doing when not with them. \n\nI would start taking a step back from your family & setting clearer boundaries- YOU decide each month what weekend you would like to visit - if it works for them. Sit them down & explain you have a new hobby/ friends/ work commitments & this is the new way going forward. Then stick to it. When at your parents, if they bother you, state your boundary & if they keep it up leave. Do this a time or two & they will quickly learn if they want to see you for the maximum time you have set they will behave. Best of luck, stay strong!", "My dog ate a tiny screw when he was little. It ended up being over $8000. They didn't even end up having to perform surgery so God knows what it could have been. Thank God for pet insurance because I only paid about 10%.", "Different strokes but by the time I was 27 I saw my parents maybe once or twice a year or so. Even in college I didn't see my parents every weekend.", "I see my parents 1-2 times per year and we only live a few hours away! Our relationship is fine but not super close. If we were friendlier I still wouldn't expect to see them more than like once every 8 weeks", "It really depends. I live in the same town. I see them a couple times a week, at least. My brother moves to WV, then NOLA, then TX.  He comes home maybe once a year (we all talk and play games together though).", "I want to stress that it's really, truly, not normal to spend every weekend at your parents' place once you've moved out, be you 18, 27, or 56.\n\nI have a great relationship with my parents and wish I could visit them more often - they live 4 hours' drive away now. But even if they lived next door to me, I wouldn't be seeing them every weekend, and they wouldn't expect me to.\n\nYour situation is even worse because, as you describe, you're not even spending that much time with them at the weekends! They're out doing their own thing during the day and you see them at dinner, right? Man.\n\nI know there are cultural differences - my brother's married to a Singaporean Chinese woman whose brother and sister-in-law used to spend multiple nights a week back at the family home, **while *their* baby stayed at their apartment with the nanny** - but there's got to be limits.", "They know where you live. We kind of stopped seeing my wife's dad because we were forever making the effort to go and see him and it was never reciprocated. Not even once. Now he ties Christmas presents for his grandkids to the door handle and not knock even though we're at home!\n\nI've not seen him for about four years and it really doesn't bother. My MiL on the other hand (they're not together) is an amazing person and is very much in our lives and I'm lucky to have her as my MiL. She took my youngest out to the theatre last night for example.", "NTA \nThe WFH story is not a bad scheme, but it's still hiding behind an excuse.  \n\nThere's a really good dialogue below from u/Jerico_Hill.  Look at the pleasant firm blocking language suggested in that script. The script is nice, it's assertive, and (crucially) it doesn't give any grip for your mother's manipulations.\nThen imagine the way your mother might actually speak to you, and think about how you might use this blocking language to counter her points.  Add those lines to your script too.  \nPrint it all out.  Find a friend.  Practise saying these things, and only those things.  Don't get lured into starting sentences with \"I'm sorry\" or suggesting compromises.  \nRemember you are not being unpleasant.  You are stating what your ground is, and (pleasantly) rebuffing somebody else's attempts to define what your life should be like.\n\nAnd then just ring your parents. Say only what's on the script in front of you and remember Reddit's behind you.  Tell us what happens if you want.\n\nKeep reminding yourself that you get to have your own life, not just be a walk-on part in your mother's.", "If she gets violent, leave. If she shouts at you on the phone, put it down. If she messaged you nasty messages block her for a week.\n\nShe continues this behaviour because you're rewarding it by complying. \n\nI'm guessing there may be some cultural implications here so here's a little script of what I would say. Hope it helps. \n\n\"Hi Mom, just letting you know I can't stay this weekend I've got plans\"\n\n\"Wah, wah. Guilt trip, how could you, what's more important than coming home blah blah\"\n\n\"Mom, I've made up my mind. These plans are important. However I'm free next Saturday. Why don't you come to visit me in city? We could go for lunch\"\n\n\"Wah wah, further impotent rage and guilt tripping\"\n\n\"Well, that's unfortunate. Anyway, I've got to go. I'll catch up with you next week\"\n\nAnd repeat as needed until she gets the message.", "Violent?\n\nJust leave the house when she does. And explain to her firmly why you left. You don't need to \"deal\" with it, just remove yourself from her area and don't go back for a while.", "That's the great part about moving out. You don't have to pick up when they call. If they show up, you don't have to open the door. You don't have to deal with your mom's passive aggressiveness (or violence???).\n\n I'm a little older than you, and I live within 1 minute driving, 7 minutes walking from my parents (my mom timed the walking by accident, she takes daily walks and goes by my house) and I still see my parents maybe a handful of times a month. And even then, it's very short visits, because I'm close by but also because I have a life! They know I have a life. They have lives too! It's all a part of growing up. Just start getting busier and busier with work, tell them you're behind on chores, and you can't possibly come to them or them to you because it's going to take you all weekend to clean. Anything! But you aren't doing anything wrong here. It's them.", "Being violent and aggressive is wrong. This is not ok. You need to create boundaries. You need to just stop going over until you have set those boundaries. You have your own life and they need to respect that.", "You can\u2019t control how they feel.", "I'm an only child too. It's hard to stand your ground. My parents retired at 50 but I won't get that privilege, I can't retire till I'm 68. So I know I need to pace myself so I live longer and that means relaxing three weekends out of four, instead of regular stressful four hour sessions with two very dominant characters (who gang up together against me). I just need to do it for my health, mental and physical. I don't have their money or lifestyle.", "That's rough, I'm sorry you have to deal with that, but I agree with everyone else that you should not be giving in to their manipulation. And no matter how much your parents try, you have the upper hand because you have the ultimate trump card, **your presence**. That is ultimately what they want and you have the power to take it away.\n\nBe clear with them about respecting your time/other plans, and be consistent about leaving or not visiting if they are aggressive/violent/manipulative. Eventually, they will realize that if they want to see you at all they need to respect you and act appropriately and that the manipulation doesn't work anymore (and actually works against them now). Best of luck!", "She knows exactly what she is doing.\n\nBluntly, from what you have said your mom is a problem. Manipulative, possesive, and abusive (your word was violent). Please don't let anyone treat you like this. If you date or marry a man like this, you could end up seriously hurt or dead.\n\nPlease talk to a therapist about building healthy relationships and protecting yourself from those who would isolate you from your friends."]}
