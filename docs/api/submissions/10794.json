{"id": 10794, "submission_id": "11aq71e", "title": "AITA for not spending every weekend with my parents?", "selftext": "I\u2019m 27 years old and work full time. Initially I travelled to work from my parent\u2019s place every day but they stay really far away and the journey one way would take about 1.5 hours due to heavy traffic. Eventually the 3 hour round trip everyday broke me and I moved closer to the city so that I wouldn\u2019t have to get up at 5am everyday. I also have a hybrid work schedule where I wfo Mon - Wed and then wfh Thu -Fri. I come back to my parents place every Thursday night and usually leave Saturday night after dinner. However, I\u2019m not able to spend every weekend with them as sometimes I\u2019d like to go out with my friends in the city or to short getaways. Despite that, I still try my best to come home every Thursday. If I have an outing planned with my friends on Saturday, I\u2019ll leave their place Friday night or Saturday morning. My mum gets upset whenever I do this and becomes very passive aggressive and sarcastic when I tell her that I have to leave early. As an example, I told my parents today that I would be leaving tomorrow morning to go to a convention with my friends in the city. My mum proceeded to go on her phone and google that convention, claiming that there is no such convention taking place (but it is and I already bought tickets). Basically she\u2019s trying to accuse me of lying. Which is ridiculous because I don\u2019t think I need a valid reason every time for why I won\u2019t be coming back or when I do have to leave early. Sometimes I would like to just stay in my apartment during the weekends and do house chores but that\u2019s not a valid reason that they would accept for not visiting. It\u2019s making me very stressed. It doesn\u2019t matter how long I stayed last weekend or that it\u2019s the first time in a month that I\u2019m not coming back, they always claim that I am \u201cmaking excuses\u201d for not visiting them. I don\u2019t think they realise how much of an effort I\u2019m making. I drive 1 hour each way every Thursday to their house and had to skip a bunch of outings with my friends to keep them happy. It\u2019s also not like we do anything when I\u2019m home. They don\u2019t go out ever, and we don\u2019t hang out as a family. My parents are off doing their own thing during the day and we only gather together during dinner time. I understand that my parents miss me as I\u2019m not home as much as I used to be but I would also like to live my own life too without feeling guilty about it.", "created_utc": 1677241527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11aq71e/aita_for_not_spending_every_weekend_with_my/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lot of people are married with kids of their own at this point, and see their parents a lot less.  \nWe live within a mile of my in-laws, and yet my partner sees his parents about once a month.\n\nYou really need to put your foot down and cut back on how often you see them.  Tell them you cannot work from home anymore so you need to be in the city from Sunday Evening to Saturday Morning.  You can drive up on Saturday, spend the night at their house and leave Sunday after dinner.

I wonder if you're an only child or if you have siblings, do they get this treatment?\n\nI'm afraid it won't get any better and now's the time to be firm. You shouldn't have to be married with kids to avoid spending every weekend with parents. You could tell them that being with them is becoming an unpleasant experience for you and you'll be doing your own thing much more from now on.

At some point just miss going for the weekend entirely and connect on the phone.\n\nIt will be painful for them but eventually they'll adjust. They need to realize you are a full adult, not their child anymore, and they don't have the same right to expect your presence in the house.\n\nNTA.", "This is not a healthy relationship, you need to see them far less and put a stop to these accusations and guilt trips.

It will be hard for your parents, the whole empty nest thing, but it needs to happen.\n\nThey need to grow, *too*. You may be the only thing keeping them connected, they have been parents *so long*.

They sound very similar to my parents. However, you have let them control you way too much. I started spending my weekends away already when I was at the uni. When I got a job, I moved away and came to visit every 3 months only.... What you are doing is way out of your way. You need to seriously live your life.\nYour parents are way too much entitled to your free time. It is time to put your foot down. Tell them in certain terms, you will be coming once a month to spend the weekend with them. That's it. No more excuses about needing to leave one day early.", "NTA You need to stop spending so much time there.  You're an adult with your own life who shouldn't feel obligated to spend all your free time with your parents. It's not healthy.  They are not going to like it and you might have to ignore them for a while, but you need to stop this routine now. Just be prepared for then to try and guilt and shame you, but don't let them.  You're an adult who should be living your own life away from your patents. Not to say people should never see their family, but this situation isn't healthy.", "Nta.\n\nI would not visit them nearly as often as you do.

You already make an effort to see them. At 27 you don't have to explain why you're leaving early either.

I would love to see her more often, but we raised a strong independent woman who is doing the same for her children. It's probably harder on you since you're an only child. Can you face time them?

Maybe they will accept once a month visiting if that works for your schedule.", "I think that is simply how she has always gotten her way with you or qnybody, of course it ia rough when you have empty nest syndrome, but she should be proud of you and be happy for raising an independant young woman, not try to guilt trip her\nShe could simply have saidd I miss having you around and would love it if we could see eachother and do ath together once a week or biweekly sounds different or?", "It's 10x easier for a guy. I first used excuses that I needed to work the weekend. That slowly got them used to me not being in the house all the time. Once you break that barrier then they stop getting used to the expectation, it gets easier from there. Make a habit of calling, then also slowly ramp down the frequency over time until it's at a level you're comfortable with."]}
