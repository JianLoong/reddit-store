Initially I travelled to work from my parent\u2019s place every day but they stay really far away and the journey one way would take about 1.5 hours due to heavy traffic. Eventually the 3 hour round trip everyday broke me and I moved closer to the city so that I wouldn\u2019t have to get up at 5am everyday. I also have a hybrid work schedule where I wfo Mon - Wed and then wfh Thu -Fri. I come back to my parents place every Thursday night and usually leave Saturday night after dinner. However, I\u2019m not able to spend every weekend with them as sometimes I\u2019d like to go out with my friends in the city or to short getaways. Despite that, I still try my best to come home every Thursday. If I have an outing planned with my friends on Saturday, I\u2019ll leave their place Friday night or Saturday morning. My mum gets upset whenever I do this and becomes very passive aggressive and sarcastic when I tell her that I have to leave early. As an example, I told my parents today that I would be leaving tomorrow morning to go to a convention with my friends in the city. My mum proceeded to go on her phone and google that convention, claiming that there is no such convention taking place (but it is and I already bought tickets). Basically she\u2019s trying to accuse me of lying. Which is ridiculous because I don\u2019t think I need a valid reason every time for why I won\u2019t be coming back or when I do have to leave early. Sometimes I would like to just stay in my apartment during the weekends and do house chores but that\u2019s not a valid reason that they would accept for not visiting. It\u2019s making me very stressed. It doesn\u2019t matter how long I stayed last weekend or that it\u2019s the first time in a month that I\u2019m not coming back, they always claim that I am \u201cmaking excuses\u201d for not visiting them. I don\u2019t think they realise how much of an effort I\u2019m making. I drive 1 hour each way every Thursday to their house and had to skip a bunch of outings with my friends to keep them happy. It\u2019s also not like we do anything when I\u2019m home. They don\u2019t go out ever, and we don\u2019t hang out as a family. My parents are off doing their own thing during the day and we only gather together during dinner time. I understand that my parents miss me as I\u2019m not home as much as I used to be but I would also like to live my own life too without feeling guilty about it.", "created_utc": 1677241527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11aq71e/aita_for_not_spending_every_weekend_with_my/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lot of people are married with kids of their own at this point, and see their parents a lot less.  \nWe live within a mile of my in-laws, and yet my partner sees his parents about once a month.\n\nYou really need to put your foot down and cut back on how often you see them.  Tell them you cannot work from home anymore so you need to be in the city from Sunday Evening to Saturday Morning.

You're an adult with your own life who shouldn't feel obligated to spend all your free time with your parents. It's not healthy.  They are not going to like it and you might have to ignore them for a while, but you need to stop this routine now. Just be prepared for then to try and guilt and shame you, but don't let them.

I would love to see her more often, but we raised a strong independent woman who is doing the same for her children. It's probably harder on you since you're an only child. Can you face time them?

Maybe they will accept once a month visiting if that works for your schedule.", "I think that is simply how she has always gotten her way with you or qnybody, of course it ia rough when you have empty nest syndrome, but she should be proud of you and be happy for raising an independant young woman, not try to guilt trip her\nShe could simply have saidd I miss having you around and would love it if we could see eachother and do ath together once a week or biweekly sounds different or?", "It's 10x easier for a guy. I first used excuses that I needed to work the weekend. That slowly got them used to me not being in the house all the time.

Therefore you have no requirements to be there. \n\nHonestly this is crazy to me. Why do they need to know every plan of yours? You are 27, a fully fledged adult. \n\nYour parents need a plan to manage their own lives and associated loneliness without putting it on you.\n\nAre they expecting you to keep this up if you were to get married or have children? \n\nYOU DO NOT NEED YOUR PARENTS PERMISSION TO LIVE IN YOUR HOME.\n\nYou don't need their permission to do a damn thing.

I can't imagine seeing my parents that much. Moved out when I was 18, and only saw them occasionally even though I was nearby. moved thousands of miles away when I was in my early 20s, and see/saw them once, maybe twice a year.", "NTA. My parents had unreasonable expectations too, in terms of visiting what they saw as my real 'home' (their home), although not as intense as yours. Even when I got married. I'm 36 now and I found that not overexplaining my decisions has really helped with boundaries. \n\nFor example, 'why can't you come over this weekend, we never see you!?'. I used to feel like I had to explain myself and justify my actions. Now I just respond with something like 'I'm busy this weekend. We can organise a lunch in a few weeks', and I just leave it at that with no room for negotiation. \n\nGood luck, it's really hard when you're enmeshed like this and your parents use guilt and manipulation because they can't let you go. Be strong!", "NTA. You have your own life to live. That's the point of raising your children to adulthood, so they can go off and live their life. \n\nI live about 1.5 hours from my mom and we see each other about once a month for a weekend. When I was in college, 5 times a year. Don't feel guilty living your life.", "NTA live your own life it's up to them to fill their own voids in their lives. The whole point of raising a child is to make them independent. Not to emotionally blackmail you each time you don't want to crawl up their asses.\n\nYou see your parents more than a lot of people even speak to theurs once they move out and establish themselves as an adult. They should be grateful you go out of your way bc technically you owe them nothing.", "NTA", "NTA. Visiting family can be lovely, but you aren't visiting them just to see them. You're trying to avoid the mess they make when you want to do literally anything else.\n\nGuilt trips and sulking are to manipulate your emotions and make you do what they want, so you're going to need to establish boundaries and consequences when they stomp on those boundaries. As an example, if you tell them your plans to leave early and they start some passive aggressive nonsense? Say you will leave if you can't enjoy the time you do have together...and then follow through. Recommend you cut the visits down once a month, too. Might be helpful to getting the new normal established.", "NTA\n\nI support your decision and think that you're doing the right thing. You're an adult, and your parents need to take a chill pill, and if they're scared of the empty nest raising problems / mom's being way too controlling, then for me that would be a \"you problem\", and let them handle it by their own means instead of trying to change their mind.\n\nHowever, if I can give you a piece of advice, is to enforce your own boundaries. Tell your parents that you have decided that you want to have a life, and you won'd be going back those many times, without any explanation or reasoning involved. And if they start calling you liar again and what not, just ignore and proceed. Pretty sure that an outing with friends will clear any doubt you might have after such a discussion.", "So NTA.....you love and care for your parents, that is commendable.  But you need to have a life and enjoy your youth.  I'm a Mom of an only daughter, she is 19 and does still live at home.  She does college courses online and works part-time.  Even living in the same household, she has a complete living space upstairs with her own bathroom, I don't see her every day.

I had some counselling for other reasons and that helped me put up some boundaries with my family, maybe that could be something you try? It's not easy but I gradually started visiting less, at the beginning there was lots of guilt trips and sulking but when I stood my ground this has lessened, I still see them 4 times a week but it's usually a flying visit. \n\nI'll tell you something that I wish someone had said to me when I was in your shoes- you are 27, you should live your life for you. Your parents have lived their own lives and You are not responsible for their feelings or loneliness, you are at a time in your life when you need to build a life for yourself, in years to come you aren't going to look back and treasure memories of sitting around every weekend to keep your parents happy but you could look back at good memories and friendships you made.

Never do they make me feel bad about it or interrogate me about what I'm doing when not with them. \n\nI would start taking a step back from your family & setting clearer boundaries- YOU decide each month what weekend you would like to visit - if it works for them. Sit them down & explain you have a new hobby/ friends/ work commitments & this is the new way going forward. Then stick to it. When at your parents, if they bother you, state your boundary & if they keep it up leave.

But even if they lived next door to me, I wouldn't be seeing them every weekend, and they wouldn't expect me to.\n\nYour situation is even worse because, as you describe, you're not even spending that much time with them at the weekends!

I don't know what her agenda is, but you are 27 years old and spending way too much time with your parents. Do you date ever? Do you have friends to hang out with? It just seems like it would be really difficult to find time to spend with anyone other than parents.\n\nLike the one comment said, tell them you can only drive up Saturday and spend the one night. Do this every week for a month. Then skip a week. Skip a week every month for a few months. Then skip 2 weeks in one month. Just slowly phase the visits out and supplement with calls or texts. If your mom gets violent, leave or hang up. You need to be forceful here because boundaries are easily broken.", "First, you need to separate the idea of people being mad at you from you having done something wrong. Failing to meet someone else\u2019s expectations is not the same as having done something wrong.\n\nYour mother *expects* you to visit every weekend, but it is not wrong for you to refuse to do that. You have a right to build a life of your own that makes you happy, so long as you are not infringing on anyone else\u2019s rights, and your mother has no right to force you to visit to her every weekend. \n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered that, realize that living the way you want will, inevitably, mean upsetting some people. That is okay. Other people being upset with you is sometimes the cost of living, it is not a problem to solve. It only affects you as much as the actual tangible consequences do. You should be nice when you can and treat everyone with respect, but treating others with respect does not require you to allow yourself and your needs to be disrespected. \n\nIf you\u2019re financially independent from your parents, the consequences of your parents being mad are basically just that your parents are mad. Make your peace with that, then start taking your weekends back. Make your plans, do what you want, and tell your parents what you\u2019ll be doing. Don\u2019t ask them - tell them. \n\nQ: \u201cBut my mother is mean and passive aggressive when I visit if I do that!\u201d \n\nA: Leave. Tell her that you don\u2019t appreciate being called a liar, you\u2019re no longer enjoying this visit, and you think it\u2019s best if you went home. Walk out of the house, get in your car, and drive home. Do not engage any further for a few days.\n\nQ: \u201cIf I do that, she\u2019ll just call me to yell at me.\u201d\n\nA: Don\u2019t answer. Mute her contact info. Block her. Unfollow her on Facebook (you can unfollow without unfriending). Don\u2019t check your phone. Go out with your friends and have a good time. It is not your job to pacify your parents.\n\nQ: \u201cWhat if she shows up at my house?\u201d\n\nA: Don\u2019t answer the door. Change the locks if she has a key. If she\u2019s trying to break in (unlikely), tell her that you\u2019re calling the cops and then actually call the cops and have her removed for trespassing. \n\nNo one can force you to interact with them unless they have some kind of leverage over you, and the only leverage your parents seem to have is emotional attachment. They can scream and cry and whine as much as they want but it\u2019s only effective if you let it be. You don\u2019t give a toddler ice cream for dinner just because they threw a tantrum and yelled at you, right? So don\u2019t reward bad behavior from adults by giving in either. \n\n[A story explaining how people who use their emotions to manipulate others turn *their* emotions into other people\u2019s problems, and how to not fall into that trap.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/) You can either make your peace that there may be a period of unrest before they adjust to your newfound independence, or you can bow to their whims your entire life.

She can feel however she wants to, and that\u2019s her right to do so.  She does not have the right to force those feelings onto you.\n\nI see you\u2019ve asked several times about how to transition out of your parents\u2019 house.  You\u2019ve already transitioned out.  You moved out.  Your life is your own and you don\u2019t need anyone else\u2019s permission to live it.\n\nI get it, I really do.  I spent far more years under my mother\u2019s thumb than you\u2019ve even been alive.  I stayed in relationships or given up on relationships because my mother\u2019s disapproval was such a looming presence in my life.  I dreaded making life decisions such as buying a car, buying a house, even having children because I knew that my mother\u2019s first reaction would not be happiness for me, but a guilt trip.  \n\nI live so close to my parents that on a quiet day, I could yell and they could hear me.  It\u2019s taken a very long time to set and enforce boundaries.  She still pushes my buttons but the response she gets now is silence rather than groveling.", "Read about enmeshment", "NTA. I\u2019m going to say this as gently as I can. You need to live your own life now. It\u2019s clear you want to make your own social group and enjoy life on your own.

You gotta stand on your own at some point and that\u2019s ok.", "NTA and you really need to set boundaries with your parents, this is a totally unhealthy expectation to have of you.", "NTA, I would be visiting way less, this is ridiculous.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t normal to visit parents this much. If you guys were really close - I\u2019d still think this is a little much.

They were extremely upset I moved away to the city. I\u2019d see them with hubby once a month as a compromise. And then with holidays so 12-15 visits a year. They were also 3 hours round trip.\n\nIt was never enough. It would get to the point when we were leaving on Sunday they\u2019d ask if we\u2019re coming out next weekend. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nWhen the pandemic hit, we got a break from them.
