In fact, I didn't with my best friend of 15 years - for a year or so. She eventually reached out when she realized those 2 girls were not good people (one of them wound up talking shit about her in a group text, instead of a private one).\n\nWe reconnected quickly once she apologized and said she realized who they really were. I'm not a person who takes being talked poorly about, and I will disconnect very quickly from it. \n\nThe C & C friends are not very good friends to your wife. Purposefully isolating her from a friend of 20 years but talking poorly about K. As if everyone else could see it and your wife was just oblivious. When K was probably excited to see her and then felt alone in a group of 4 people.\n\nAdditionally, it's most likely the only drama they can create for entertainment. Being moms and not having any time away from their kids and all. What other drama are they going to create? Their pediatrician told them their kid needs speech therapy? The pre-school drop-off line was super slow? Idk. Sounds like her other 2 \"friends\" are just rude and bored.", "NTA, but I'm weirded out by the age gap. You got a kid when you were 21 and she was 29? At what age did you start dating?", "NTA", "NTA. The truth hurts. And if your wife couldnt figure out herself that her lifelong friend might not be very comfy with all mothers talking non stop about kids during her hens, doe thing then she needed you to tell her. Sounds like some high school type shit here going on here and you nicely called her out on that shit.", "Motherhood ain't that deep, IMO. I remember feeling drained by all the activity around having a baby and then a toddler. And I remember being bored AF at the same time and wanting to do more with my free time than celebrate being a mommy. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I know that *some* people do find great validation and define themselves in their parenting. Some of us, just don't. Neither is the better of the other, IMO. And I run like heck from women who can only seem to discuss diapering, feeding, teething and whatever their lil' precious just did that was so cute this morning. And I'm a mom myself.\n\nAnd your wife thinking that Kayla losing three babies makes her unable to appreciate motherhood is just odd of her, IMO. \n\nSo, NTA. Lost of us moms don't really get all the energy expended in judging women who don't have kids anyway? Saying someone who has health problems and has been isolated by distance is a bad friend because she's not there always to hold your hand or pump you up is more silly to me than just rude and unintelligent.", "You dug yourself quite a hole, my dude.\n\nAs you describe,  it does sound like your wife and her friends were definitely being rather gossipy/catty/derogatory/unfair/whatever.\n\nLots of better ways you could have had that discussion with her rather than your in-your-face method.  It may be exactly as you say in that they are just being terrible friends.  Or perhaps you may have found out more about Kayla that lead to her actually being a \"suck\".\n\nIts fine you want to defend Kayla, but you sucked at it.  Not only did you not do a good job and convince your wife that maybe she needs to reach  out to Kayla, now you are in the proverbial doghouse, and your wife straight up left.  Remember she's the one you married, not Kayla. \n\nI'm going to say YTA.\n\naddendum - please stop using \"duck\" as a replacement for the f word.  Just use a different word. I would almost say YTA just for that.", "Whilst it may have been a reality check, it does sound rather harsh. You could likely have pointed out things rather less forcefully. It\u2019s not your job to be Kaylas champion, but it is to your benefit to have a happy wife. ESH.", "NTA. She absolutely needled to hear that. She's trashing and potentially throwing away a good friend in order to fit in. I'm sure in the end, C and C will find some reason to ditch her and then she won't have anyone. She's bringing that on herself. C and C don't seem to have anyone's best interests at heart except their own.", "YTA very mildly. Your wife didn't ask for your input, but you provided it anyway. Then, you lectured her like she's a child. It sounds like your wife was really mean and dismissive to Kayla, but it really wasn't your place to lecture her on it.", "Within that tirade you dumped on your wife, did you ask your wife if **she** had checked in with Kayla since the wedding, given Kayla's \u201cmultiple trips to urgent care\u201d illnesses?

You, for your judgmental and ill-informed opinions - mostly assumptions - and for harshly expressing them, and also your wife for neglecting her friend.", "YTA.\n\nJust because Kayla was a good friend to your wife in the past doesn't mean she's being a good friend presently.\n\nWhy do you think you have the right to judge your wife's friendships? First of all you slam your  wife for \"only\" having four friends, which is a bizarrely judgmental thing to say, and then you decide to take it upon yourself to bring further judgment against your wife in which friendships she is actively cultivating and call her an asshole for choosing something different than you would.\n\nYou weren't at the bachelorette party. So how would you know how Kayla was acting? You decide to call your wife a liar for an event that you weren't even present for?\n\nThese are not your relationships. They are your wife's. She gets to decide who she is friends with and who is treating her poorly. Not you. You are acting in an extremely controlling and inappropriate way towards your wife.

Sometimes the truth hurts but part of loving someone is not constantly feeding into the ego that they are right no matter what. Shitty behavior is shitty behavior.", "NTA. Part of healthy relationships is being able to tell each other the truth even when it\u2019s hard. The fact that your wife left you rather than take valid criticism is a huge red flag. She also needs to understand that Codie and Casey aren\u2019t really her friends. They\u2019re mean girls who thrive on tearing others down, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before they turn on her too.", "I\u2019m not sure what the conflict is here you gave an opinion on something nobody asked for.

There may be more to it, but you did ask for an explanation before telling her your opinion. And, if there isn\u2019t more to the situation, you were right. You need to find out if there was more to it. You need to figure out what this means for you and your relationship too.\n\nI\u2019d imagine that the reason you got so upset is that you don\u2019t want to believe the person you married and have kids with would act like this, right? No one wants to find out their spouse is the sort of person who uses a friend and then abandons them as the other person needs them at all. Kayla didn\u2019t even demand any support of your wife, she just kind of existed in a way that didn\u2019t serve your wife\u2019s needs. Will she do the same to you, the kids, or your family someday?\n\nY\u2019all are going to have to have a serious conversation where you both keep your cool to figure this out.

I don't know how calling out somebody who decided to sulk in a corner during a fun event is wrong, but again, you're just going to insult me instead of explaining that."]}
