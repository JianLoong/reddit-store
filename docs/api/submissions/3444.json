She eventually reached out when she realized those 2 girls were not good people (one of them wound up talking shit about her in a group text, instead of a private one).\n\nWe reconnected quickly once she apologized and said she realized who they really were. I'm not a person who takes being talked poorly about, and I will disconnect very quickly from it. \n\nThe C & C friends are not very good friends to your wife. Purposefully isolating her from a friend of 20 years but talking poorly about K. As if everyone else could see it and your wife was just oblivious. When K was probably excited to see her and then felt alone in a group of 4 people.\n\nAdditionally, it's most likely the only drama they can create for entertainment. Being moms and not having any time away from their kids and all. What other drama are they going to create? Their pediatrician told them their kid needs speech therapy?

I know that *some* people do find great validation and define themselves in their parenting. Some of us, just don't. Neither is the better of the other, IMO. And I run like heck from women who can only seem to discuss diapering, feeding, teething and whatever their lil' precious just did that was so cute this morning. And I'm a mom myself.\n\nAnd your wife thinking that Kayla losing three babies makes her unable to appreciate motherhood is just odd of her, IMO. \n\nSo, NTA. Lost of us moms don't really get all the energy expended in judging women who don't have kids anyway?

No one wants to find out their spouse is the sort of person who uses a friend and then abandons them as the other person needs them at all. Kayla didn\u2019t even demand any support of your wife, she just kind of existed in a way that didn\u2019t serve your wife\u2019s needs.

Dont insult C & C, even though you may want to.
