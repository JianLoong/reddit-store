She eventually reached out when she realized those 2 girls were not good people (one of them wound up talking shit about her in a group text, instead of a private one).\n\nWe reconnected quickly once she apologized and said she realized who they really were. I'm not a person who takes being talked poorly about, and I will disconnect very quickly from it. \n\nThe C & C friends are not very good friends to your wife. Purposefully isolating her from a friend of 20 years but talking poorly about K. As if everyone else could see it and your wife was just oblivious. When K was probably excited to see her and then felt alone in a group of 4 people.\n\nAdditionally, it's most likely the only drama they can create for entertainment. Being moms and not having any time away from their kids and all. What other drama are they going to create? Their pediatrician told them their kid needs speech therapy?

I remember feeling drained by all the activity around having a baby and then a toddler.

I know that *some* people do find great validation and define themselves in their parenting. Some of us, just don't. Neither is the better of the other, IMO. And I run like heck from women who can only seem to discuss diapering, feeding, teething and whatever their lil' precious just did that was so cute this morning. And I'm a mom myself.\n\nAnd your wife thinking that Kayla losing three babies makes her unable to appreciate motherhood is just odd of her, IMO.\n\nSo, NTA. Lots of us moms don't really get all the energy expended in judging women who don't have kids anyway?

It may be exactly as you say in that they are just being terrible friends.  Or perhaps you may have found out more about Kayla that lead to her actually being a \"suck\".\n\nIts fine you want to defend Kayla, but you sucked at it.  Not only did you not do a good job and convince your wife that maybe she needs to reach  out to Kayla, now you are in the proverbial doghouse, and your wife straight up left.

So how would you know how Kayla was acting? You decide to call your wife a liar for an event that you weren't even present for?\n\nThese are not your relationships. They are your wife's.

Part of healthy relationships is being able to tell each other the truth even when it\u2019s hard. The fact that your wife left you rather than take valid criticism is a huge red flag.

No one wants to find out their spouse is the sort of person who uses a friend and then abandons them as the other person needs them at all. Kayla didn\u2019t even demand any support of your wife, she just kind of existed in a way that didn\u2019t serve your wife\u2019s needs.
