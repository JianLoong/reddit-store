Okay, here\u2019s the situation. I (25M) am expecting a daughter in November with my fiance Clair. My name is Cody, so we\u2019d like to keep the C theme going. If we have a boy later, he\u2019ll be Charles after Clair\u2019s grandpa. My fiance and me really like the name Keelee, but we\u2019re spelling it Ceelee or Cheelee with a hard C to keep the theme.\n\nThe problem is my sister Angie (28F). She\u2019s child free, but she\u2019s still very opinionated and judgemental about names. She strongly prefers traditional common names like Emma and Madeline, and she\u2019s been very pissy about the name we picked. Last weekend, we went to her and her boyfriend\u2019s place for Memorial Day, and she took my fiance Clair aside, supposedly to \u201chelp cut vegetables.\u201d Actually, Angie just wanted to rip into my fiance with her name opinions. She said we should forget about Cheelee. She said she\u2019d already talked it over with our mom (Clair\u2019s MIL), and \u201cthey\u2019d decided that we should go with Catherine/ Catie instead.\u201d Clair of course said hell no to that, and called me.\n\nI came in, and I told Angie we needed to go. In the car home, we called my mom, but she wouldn\u2019t admit to \u201cagreeing\u201d with Angie about belting the name. I don\u2019t think my family has veto power, it\u2019s our choice as a couple and they should MYOB. However: Angie has Asperger\u2019s, and she\u2019s the person in the family who says what everyone is thinking, but no one will say. If multiple people in the family hate this name, I worry that the negative vibe will impact our daughter.

You're poor kid is going to have an uphill battle their entire life trying to explain that Ceelee is pronounced Keelee, and is unlikely to appreciate your C goal and inevitably choose to go by something else by the time they are in middle school. *Everyone* will say Seelee. Then, think how kids react to being told they said a name wrong. They just make fun of it instead. \"Sealy? Like the matress? Hey you wanna be my matress?\" You're just setting your daughter up for a life of torment over her name.\n\nThere was an AITA many years back about someone naming their daughter Karen, and the OP was declared TA for trying to convince the mother it would be a mistake. The same trend there happened here of, how dare someone interfere with the parents right to name their child. It was all valid, but that person's heart was at least in the right place. Long story short, it panned out with several updates over the years that the parents legally changed the kid's name because adults would snicker at the name in public.

Okay, here\u2019s the situation. I (25M) am expecting a daughter in November with my fiance Clair. My name is Cody, so we\u2019d like to keep the C theme going. If we have a boy later, he\u2019ll be Charles after Clair\u2019s grandpa. My fiance and me really like the name Keelee, but we\u2019re spelling it Ceelee or Cheelee with a hard C to keep the theme.\n\nThe problem is my sister Angie (28F). She\u2019s child free, but she\u2019s still very opinionated and judgemental about names. She strongly prefers traditional common names like Emma and Madeline, and she\u2019s been very pissy about the name we picked. Last weekend, we went to her and her boyfriend\u2019s place for Memorial Day, and she took my fiance Clair aside, supposedly to \u201chelp cut vegetables.\u201d Actually, Angie just wanted to rip into my fiance with her name opinions. She said we should forget about Cheelee. She said she\u2019d already talked it over with our mom (Clair\u2019s MIL), and \u201cthey\u2019d decided that we should go with Catherine/ Catie instead.\u201d Clair of course said hell no to that, and called me.\n\nI came in, and I told Angie we needed to go. In the car home, we called my mom, but she wouldn\u2019t admit to \u201cagreeing\u201d with Angie about belting the name. I don\u2019t think my family has veto power, it\u2019s our choice as a couple and they should MYOB. However: Angie has Asperger\u2019s, and she\u2019s the person in the family who says what everyone is thinking, but no one will say. If multiple people in the family hate this name, I worry that the negative vibe will impact our daughter. AITA (or, are we the assholes) for not taking family feedback into consideration?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
