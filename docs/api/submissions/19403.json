I've used hair color spray before and it's so easy to get out of your hair, if your son really wanted it gone could have easily washed it out in the sink.\n\nAlso, no one at 19 is going to get bullied by their classmates for having purple hair, at most his friends might do some harmless teasing...ya know, like most friends do with each other.", "YTA.

Everyone but you believe the punishment was unnecessary, including your son who was the 'victim' of said prank.\n\nIt sounds like your children have a great sibling relationship, and I'd like to believe their relationship with you is great as well, so do yourself and your family a favour and be the great man that you were until this mistake by apologizing and returning the car keys. Remind them that you love them, maybe even ask to be let in on any more serious prank ideas beforehand, but don't drive a wedge between any relationships you all have by pulling the \"I'm always right\" card, because no one is always right and admitting it builds trust and respect that will allow you to communicate with, and help your children be the best version of themselves. \n\nWish you all the best", "THEY'RE ADULTS - YTA.", "YTA.

You need to stop doling out punishments like their minors. Spray in color isn\u2019t bad. Perhaps if she got some of the spray on his bedding or clothes, you can suggested she wash them or replace them if they were ruined. Your kids seem like they have a great relationship, which is good! I think you should make an effort to stop treating them like minors and shift into treating them like adults. And please consider apologizing to your daughter for overreacting and give her her car keys back.", "YTA if you only punish her. Purple wash-out hair dye is not a big deal at all, and your son didn\u2019t even care. Way to prove that you favor one kid over the other, though.", "YTA. Your son didn't care about the purple hair, so I have no idea why you're making such a huge deal out of it. To top it off, unless you're excluding information, you never set a limit with them on how far the pranks were allowed to go, so your adult daughter should not be punished for what was quite honestly a completely harmless prank.", "YTA. They don't need you to referee anymore, they are 19 and can work this out between themselves. It is absolutely ridiculous that you stepped in and punished your adult daughter. Totally, and utterly, ridiculous", "YTA, that was way over the top for that kind of prank.", "I think you shouldn't be asking AITAH but instead why did this make you angry? Pretty sure if you answer that you'll heal some of that trauma.", "YTA- personally I think pranking is just stupid and people should stop doing it. However, in terms of pranks, this hardly fits the criteria. Your son didn\u2019t care about it, and it washes out. No big deal.\nYou overreacted.", "Op not sure why you posted the question when you\u2019re just going to argue with everyone who you don\u2019t agree with \n\nYour son didn\u2019t mind the prank.

Why get in the middle of this? The kids aren\u2019t upset. They\u2019re fine with the consequences (so far) of pranking each other.  What is so horrible about temporary purple hair that it\u2019s just gone too far and needs parental intervention? Absolute asshat.", "If your son didn't mind. Then you overreacted, which would be a simple fix. Talk to the wife then, u b like, fine. I didn't like joke but here.... The fact that she called you an AH, yeah no that a whole new level of disrespect.", "Purple hair on a 19-year-old is pretty normal. If you\u2019re going to punish someone; then, (absent obvious abuse), you should have set some ground rules. \n\nBig YTA.", "YTA. I would understand being punished if your son was upset but he isn't. And *both* of your kids are adults. My husband when he was in high school was always dying his hair multiple different colors (including, purple, blue and pink) and *no one cared*. Heck I'm assuming your kids are in college due to ages where people usually try out new hairstyles and looks which means most likely no one would care there either.

Or are you a \"man's man\" who can't accept things that might be outside your comfort zone?\n\nSure, maybe your son defended his sister, but I suspect he really didn't mind the hair and is plotting ways to prank her back (I imagine he'll get pretty creative after this one.)\n\nThis was harmless, unless you know for certain that it caused your son emotional harm and he displayed such. I bet the kids at school were more in awe at the hair than ridiculing your son for being different. You appear to be the only one having an issue.\n\nYTA. Taking your daughter's car keys was extreme and far exceeded as a punishment. If anything, give her an extra chore for the weekend, like if your son mows the lawn, then she would have to do it the next time it needs mowing. And be sure that if you punish her for her pranks that you punish him too.\n\nFYI, your daughter isn't speaking to you because she knows you're an a-hole and she's trying to decide if it's worth it to continue having any contact with you. She's gotten the message that you value your son over her, that appearances mean more to you than her, that you're so terrified of potential ridicule for a few days for your son that you'll deprive her of a means of escaping the hell you're subjecting her to. Yes, hell. I don't know if you do similar extremes in other avenues and aspects with your children, but your daughter definitely knows now that she's less important to you than purple hair. \n\nTrust me on this, I'm female and my parents coddled my brother whilst growing up. My dad especially had a very sexist view of things where my sister andbi were expected to take care of the house, clean everything in sight, keep it clean (even when we weren't there), have a filling hot meal ready whenever he chose to walk in the door; yet we were also expected to help him out in his business too, when he was short staffed. My sister and I knew our dad would always choose our brother over us, yet when my dad died, it was us, his daughters, with him for his final breaths. My dad had to learn how to appreciate and express that appreciation to his daughters. I'm grateful he did. Are you willing to listen and learn? If so, have your wife start the talking, work through this.\n\nEdit: my comment posted mid-sentence. Oops!

This is about you for some weird reason.", "If you have allowed the pranks to go on and it reaches a point that you consider too far, you need to have a talk with your children about what too far is. A punishment immediately at the first sign of overstepping boundaries they were unaware of is not ok. \n\nYou allowed the pranks, you just need a discussion about keeping it harmless.
