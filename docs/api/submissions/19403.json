I've used hair color spray before and it's so easy to get out of your hair, if your son really wanted it gone could have easily washed it out in the sink.\n\nAlso, no one at 19 is going to get bullied by their classmates for having purple hair, at most his friends might do some harmless teasing...ya know, like most friends do with each other.", "YTA.

Remind them that you love them, maybe even ask to be let in on any more serious prank ideas beforehand, but don't drive a wedge between any relationships you all have by pulling the \"I'm always right\" card, because no one is always right and admitting it builds trust and respect that will allow you to communicate with, and help your children be the best version of themselves. \n\nWish you all the best", "THEY'RE ADULTS - YTA.", "YTA.

I think you should make an effort to stop treating them like minors and shift into treating them like adults. And please consider apologizing to your daughter for overreacting and give her her car keys back.", "YTA if you only punish her. Purple wash-out hair dye is not a big deal at all, and your son didn\u2019t even care. Way to prove that you favor one kid over the other, though.", "YTA. Your son didn't care about the purple hair, so I have no idea why you're making such a huge deal out of it. To top it off, unless you're excluding information, you never set a limit with them on how far the pranks were allowed to go, so your adult daughter should not be punished for what was quite honestly a completely harmless prank.", "YTA. They don't need you to referee anymore, they are 19 and can work this out between themselves. It is absolutely ridiculous that you stepped in and punished your adult daughter. Totally, and utterly, ridiculous", "YTA, that was way over the top for that kind of prank.", "I think you shouldn't be asking AITAH but instead why did this make you angry? Pretty sure if you answer that you'll heal some of that trauma.", "YTA- personally I think pranking is just stupid and people should stop doing it. However, in terms of pranks, this hardly fits the criteria. Your son didn\u2019t care about it, and it washes out. No big deal.\nYou overreacted.", "Op not sure why you posted the question when you\u2019re just going to argue with everyone who you don\u2019t agree with \n\nYour son didn\u2019t mind the prank.

Why get in the middle of this? The kids aren\u2019t upset. They\u2019re fine with the consequences (so far) of pranking each other.  What is so horrible about temporary purple hair that it\u2019s just gone too far and needs parental intervention? Absolute asshat.", "If your son didn't mind. Then you overreacted, which would be a simple fix. Talk to the wife then, u b like, fine. I didn't like joke but here.... The fact that she called you an AH, yeah no that a whole new level of disrespect.", "Purple hair on a 19-year-old is pretty normal.

And *both* of your kids are adults. My husband when he was in high school was always dying his hair multiple different colors (including, purple, blue and pink) and *no one cared*. Heck I'm assuming your kids are in college due to ages where people usually try out new hairstyles and looks which means most likely no one would care there either.

They aren\u2019t mocked for wearing certain colors. \n\nThere\u2019s still teasing and things aren\u2019t perfect - they  are never going to be - but most of the kids I know definitely don\u2019t think about clothing and appearance the way their parents and grandparents worry about. None of them would bat an eye at purple hair on a boy, or if they did it would be to compliment the color change.\n\nMost of the time the first time it\u2019s even occurring to them to be self conscious about such things is coming from a \u201cwell-meaning\u201d family member.", "Are you really that fragile?", "No one cared but you though... and if you really thought it would affect him at school because he would get bullied you would have made him wash his hair or even stay home.\n\nYTA", "He's 19, not 9.", "First of all most people that age dye their hair. Second of all, most people *do not care*. And finally, again, IT WASHES OUT LITERALLY THE DAY OF. IT'S A CAN OF SPRAY ON DYE, YOU CAN REMOVE IT WITH PEROXIDE AND SHAMPOO.\n\nHe's literally her age. He would've had to agree and sit through it for her to even manage it. They did this *together* and you punished her for *no reason*.\n\nHe didn't get mocked, you're making that up. That's called a strawman. The truth is you don't even have a leg to stand on. You're just a control freak.", "I doubt. Kids today will think it's cool.", "So now, instead, you're being mocked by your kids and their friends, and now thanks to this post, the world.", "It's spray hair colour, after 1 spray he could have stopped her. If he had a full purple head then he let her do it", "Why do you treat your son like he's a fragile little doll that could be broken at any moment? Additionally why are you punishing your adult child?", "So why didn\u2019t you help him wash it out? Or lend him a hat? Taking his sister\u2019s keys didn\u2019t make his hair less purple, did it?", "You punished her for a harmless prank that didn't hurt anyone and even your son was able to laugh it off. You never punished your son for the same level of pranks. Do you not see how you might be AH?", "You sound like an abusive dad. I hope you\u2019re not expecting to give her away at her wedding.", "Exactly, it doesn't make sense to suddenly punish her when you've never punished him. This is such a harmless prank and you're blowing it way out of proportion. From your other comments you say he\u2019s always defending his sister. Who is it she needs defending from?", "You are right, it doesn't make sense to punish someone for using temporary hair color on someone else's hair, especially when both people are adults and no one really cares.", "Was it the spray on kind? That should just wash out.", "So do you plan on apologizing to your daughter and returning her car keys?", "Well he's set a boundary now \ud83c\udfbb", "And he's applying a rule that moderates how his adult children treat each other, which is out of line.", "He's the man of the house!!! Everyone should listen to him when the judge makes a ruling! Apparently his son is more of a man than he is based on the reactions.", "Glad kids you\u2019re around don\u2019t tease each other for this !", "Being fragile is when you don\u2019t want your son to be mocked at school\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "So that makes it okay for him to get mocked?", "Because he never did the same level of prank.", "because he never dyed her hair right before school.\n\nMy wife and me", "Exactly. Sometimes even just brushing your hair gets most of that spray stuff out.", "Oh yes, there's so much logic is punishing his kid over a boundary they never new existed.\n\nIf she had done something irreversible and harmful towards his son then yea, a punishment is warranted but not over something like this. At most a warning but even that seems silly when dealing with two legal adults.", "How is it out of line if neither of them have a problem with it?", "It sounds like they don\u2019t tease each other for this where you are either.\n\nIt also sounds like you may have been teased if you did this as a child. I\u2019m sorry for that.\n\nI understand how strong those childhood memories and fears can be. Part of being a parent is recognizing that our children have different experiences than us.\n\nIf your son is saying this isn\u2019t a big deal and that he\u2019s not worried about teasing then you need to put your own experiences aside and take him at his word.", "Yeah, actually, it is.  He's an adult; do you not think you raised him well enough to withstand a bit of (at this point still hypothetical) mocking?", "Good lord man, your son is NINETEEN. If your son was in first grade this kind of \"maybe they'll make fun of him\" freakout might be understandable. But your son is a literal adult. Do you have so little faith in the job you've done raising him that you think he either a) can't make a judgment about his own schoolmates or b) can't handle a few jokes about a TEMPORARY hair color?", "Well... yeah. Your son is legally an adult, and apparently more mature than you are. He can deal with school on his own, and he deemed that hair color is not going to significantly affect his quality of life. Your reaction, however, is childish and shows a certain fragility.", "I went to school with my hair dye bright red and people literally complimented me left and right.", "Dude he's 19 and a legal adult. I'd be willing to bet that he ain't the only one at his school with \"fashion\" colored hair.", "My dude, you are the only one in your entire family who gave a fuck about the purple hair.  This is YOUR issue.  Not even the \"victim\" gives a shit.  Stop being a weirdo and let it go.\n\nIf he's always \"defending his sister,\" then it sounds like this is an ongoing problem with you.  Back off your daughter.", "No one at his college is going to mock him over his hair color.  Adults have better things to do with their time.  It's 2023, purple hair is not unusual.  I've had blue, purple, pink, green, red, cyan and multi-color hair as an adult.   No one mocked me.  In any case, if your son was truly worried about that, he could have washed it out, it takes like 2 minutes.", "Okay you keep bringing up him getting mocked. Did that actually happen?? I\u2019m guessing not. We can all tell who your favorite kid is btw.", "No one is going to care in the least. They may point it out if they're familiar with him then move on with their day.\n\nIt's not some defining traits nowadays, its just one of many colors you'll find in the sea of humanity in college where no one cares someone just went to class with a literal rainbow colored hair.", "I saw 3 dudes today going about their business today. They all had purple hair. No one gave a fuck.", "Op it\u2019s hair dye. She didn\u2019t shave off his whole head.", "IT WASHES OUT, WHAT LEVEL OF PRANK? Dude you sound like you just suck the fun out of every room you walk into. Do you even like your daughter?\n\nYou say your son always protects her, did you ever consider that he has to protect her from is *you*? Because that is screwed up.", "Not according to your son. If HE believes it's a harmless prank and isn't mad at his sister, then HE is the judge of it, not you.", "I don't understand why you think this prank is of a certain level, seems pretty harmless to me.", "You\u2019re the only person who believes this prank was too far. You are the only person who believes harm was done. Do you not recognize that you alone are fabricating this crime and subsequent punishment?", "Because the son is the favorite child. And dad has to perceive an injustice to knock his daughter down.\n\nYTA, OP.", "Your son sat for the hair dyeing. Purple hair is not that serious.", "Are you sure it\u2019s not because you wanted your son to win the prank war?", "Dye that can easily be washed out in the sink, why didn't you ask your son to wash it out? Too busy focused on punishing your daughter?\n\nIt's a good thing she has her brother to look out for her if this is how you parent because a previous comment said your wife also always defends her so are you sure it's not just you?", "If he's always defending her from you, do you ever think that you might be in the wrong? They're adults!", "So you're cool with it happening to you?", "Dad's actions are out of line.", "He can but does that mean it\u2019s okay for him to get mocked just because he knows how to stand up for himself?", "The sprays normally come out in 1 wash too.", "Maybe because he considers it a \u201cgirly\u201d color, or something ridiculous like that.", "The 19yr old male in question is \"cool\" with it. He was the \"victim\", if he is ok with it then dad needs to get a grip and let his adult son and daughter works things out between them.", "It only takes one wash to go back to your natural color. As a prank, it wouldn\u2019t bother me.", "Having my hair spontaneously sprayed purple with easily washed out dye? Yea, I have zero issues with that, especially if it's due to a fun prank war with my sibling.", "Oh sorry lol, I misinterpreted the meaning of the comma.", "Dude he's 19; yes, he's your kid, but seriously step off his ass.", "Sounds like your daughter knows how to stand up for herself.", "If he were truly worried about that, he could've washed it out.  It takes like 2 minutes.  But come on, college students aren't going to mock someone for their hair color.", "YTA. If he's capable of standing up for himself, then let him. You are such a fragile, delicate helicopter parent.", "You know even if he's mocked, he is an adult, I bet you he can handle it. I think you were jumping the gun on the whole situation. If he was punished at school for it, or he was mocked,. Then I could see you punishing her, but nothing happened", "Quit being such a damn snowflake over spray on hair. If you keep treating her this way she *will* grow to hate you.", "No one mocks people for coloured hair now a-days, grow up, or, down rather.", "And we\u2019re all proud of her for that", "Sounds like you're not, since you're going nuclear on her for doing so. Your (adult!) son fucked around and found out\u2014in an incredibly light, harmless way that he is not worried about. Yes, your handwringing over purple hair makes you fragile.", "\u201cI\u2019m proud of her by punishing her for a harmless prank\u201d", "Yeah, that\u2019s clearly not true.", "No you're not. Don't lie to us.", "BS"]}
