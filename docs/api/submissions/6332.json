But she could easily break their leases in the basis that OP had no standing to have \"tenants.\" It's not even a question of money. OP's mom is the owner and the only person that can legally extend the offer to live at the residence.", "It depends how long they've been living there b/c they could have squatter's rights at that point. They prob don't have \"tenant's rights\" since there is no formal agreement.  \n\n\nOP should've really spoken to their mom about all this ahead of time in order to avoid a situation like this. If they had just proposed this to the mom, then they could've hammered out the details where OP could've served in a landlord capacity. Instead, OP decided to be greedy af and it's gonna bite them in the ass.", "You\u2019re assuming OP thinks anything through.  His post  history shows he only cares about himself.", "Damn, OP. If you have to come make a thread here every couple weeks, YTA.", "Oh JFC. Can't even with this dude.", "No, they're tenants.  Unauthorized sublet lessees are not squatters.  And no formal agreement needs to be made to establish residency.   If one has lived in a unit for more than thirty days, you have to serve notice to vacate per your state's time parameters, and file for eviction if they don't comply.", "People who smoke meth from a glass pipe shouldn't throw stones", "...but they aren't sublet lessees, are they lol?\n\nThere is no formal agreement of a sublet. Tbh some complexes explicitly prohibit subletting w/o going through them first....ppl really need to read their rules/regulations/covenants b/c idk if these people would be considered tenants at all if subletting is prohibited. I know that I lived in a complex where subletting was prohibited unless you got explicit permission from the owner of the apartment/condo.\n\nEDIT: There are still agreements surrounding renting an AirBnB (you're renting for a short period of time...not leasing out a room like what he's doing)....OP is essentially leasing out an AirBnB.\n\nLike I said, all OP had to do was call his mom and get permission lol."]}
