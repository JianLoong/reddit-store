James bullied her a lot over her looks and Madison did have some mental health/self-esteem struggles because of him. Madison and James never saw each other again after graduation.\r  \n\r  \nMadison was recently looking up the names of old classmates, which is how she learned that James actually died last year. James\u2019 daughter Ashley made a post on his birthday saying that she misses him every day but also knows he\u2019s in heaven watching over her.\r  \n\r  \nMadison sent a direct message to Ashley telling her that James wasn\u2019t the person Ashley thought she was and gave examples of some of the things James would say to her. Madison went even further by ending with how she would bet money that James isn\u2019t in heaven.\r  \n\r  \nAshley posted screenshots of Madison\u2019s messages and it\u2019s gotten a lot of attention online. People are leaving comments on Madison\u2019s page calling her a horrible person and she claims that a lot of people unfriended her online.\r  \n\r  \nMadison knows some of the people who saw the posts in real life. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely, but Madison is still afraid that this could reflect badly on her at work and possibly impact her ability to get a promotion if her supervisors find out.\r  \n\r  \nMadison admits she was angry and didn\u2019t think before messaging Ashley but that it was still justified and she shouldn\u2019t have to bite her tongue because James dying doesn\u2019t change the way he treated her in school.\r  \n\r  \nI told Madison that she has herself to blame for the aforementioned issues and she should apologize to Ashley. I agree you don\u2019t need to lie that someone was a great person even if they\u2019ve died. But what did she think messaging a grieving kid those things would accomplish?\r  \n\r  \nMadison told me she may have done something brash in a moment of anger but that I am a terrible sister for not having her back.\r  \n\r  \nOur Dad is defending Madison because it took years for her to regain her self-esteem because of how people like James treated her in school. Dad says Ashley is young but she\u2019s the same age that Madison was when James was making the comments he did towards her and eventually she\u2019d have to learn some hard truths about who her parents actually were.\r  \n\r  \nOur Mom said it\u2019s obvious looking back that Madison responded poorly, but it was done in a moment of anger when she wasn\u2019t thinking. Mom insists that everyone would have moved on from it already if it hadn\u2019t happened online and this kind of blowback to Madison isn\u2019t justified. \r  \n\r  \nOur parents both told me that I am the one who owes an apology to Madison because everyone has gone too far in moments of anger and Madison doesn\u2019t deserve this kind of stress. They told me a good sister would have had compassion instead of judgment.

James bullied her a lot over her looks and Madison did have some mental health/self-esteem struggles because of him. Madison and James never saw each other again after graduation.\r  \n\r  \nMadison was recently looking up the names of old classmates, which is how she learned that James actually died last year. James\u2019 daughter Ashley made a post on his birthday saying that she misses him every day but also knows he\u2019s in heaven watching over her.\r  \n\r  \nMadison sent a direct message to Ashley telling her that James wasn\u2019t the person Ashley thought she was and gave examples of some of the things James would say to her. Madison went even further by ending with how she would bet money that James isn\u2019t in heaven.\r  \n\r  \nAshley posted screenshots of Madison\u2019s messages and it\u2019s gotten a lot of attention online. People are leaving comments on Madison\u2019s page calling her a horrible person and she claims that a lot of people unfriended her online.\r  \n\r  \nMadison knows some of the people who saw the posts in real life. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely, but Madison is still afraid that this could reflect badly on her at work and possibly impact her ability to get a promotion if her supervisors find out.\r  \n\r  \nMadison admits she was angry and didn\u2019t think before messaging Ashley but that it was still justified and she shouldn\u2019t have to bite her tongue because James dying doesn\u2019t change the way he treated her in school.\r  \n\r  \nI told Madison that she has herself to blame for the aforementioned issues and she should apologize to Ashley. I agree you don\u2019t need to lie that someone was a great person even if they\u2019ve died. But what did she think messaging a grieving kid those things would accomplish?\r  \n\r  \nMadison told me she may have done something brash in a moment of anger but that I am a terrible sister for not having her back.\r  \n\r  \nOur Dad is defending Madison because it took years for her to regain her self-esteem because of how people like James treated her in school. Dad says Ashley is young but she\u2019s the same age that Madison was when James was making the comments he did towards her and eventually she\u2019d have to learn some hard truths about who her parents actually were.\r  \n\r  \nOur Mom said it\u2019s obvious looking back that Madison responded poorly, but it was done in a moment of anger when she wasn\u2019t thinking. Mom insists that everyone would have moved on from it already if it hadn\u2019t happened online and this kind of blowback to Madison isn\u2019t justified. \r  \n\r  \nOur parents both told me that I am the one who owes an apology to Madison because everyone has gone too far in moments of anger and Madison doesn\u2019t deserve this kind of stress. They told me a good sister would have had compassion instead of judgment. AITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your sister didn\u2019t need to bring his kid in on her beef with dad.", "NTA. Madison \"didn't think\" and took her anger out publicly on a young girl, grieving, caring nothing about hurting her more. How can you have her back? The \"years\" you speak of should have taught her that actions have consequences and/or been used for some therapy to help her deal with what bullying did to her. Now, she has become a bully to a younger girl, and it backfired spectacularly. Airing grievances on social media is not the same as blurting out something to a family member in a moment of anger", "So, it's ok to bully the child of your bully in retaliation. After her parent died?\n\nWow, Madison needs to do more of the hard work with a therapist. She absolutely owes the daughter an apology, but at some point, it's better to let things go than continue to stir them up.\n\nNTA\n\nPeople should always use caution on social media - because it's freaking forever.", "NTA NTA Look who\u2019s the BULLY now?

I don\u2019t think you can come back from this one with an apology. Madison is an adult now, in anger or not she knew exactly what she was doing. As traumatic as it was for her & life changing she had no right to verbally abuse her bully\u2019s child because he has died!?!?!?", "NTA\n\nThe person who bullied her is dead. \n\nThe girl should thank her stars that her tormentor is dead and move on.", "Madison has now become the bully. What happened to her had nothing to do with Ashley. She was innocent and didn't deserve that. She could have kept it to herself. Your sister needs therapy. NTA. Your parents aren't helping her by taking her side in this.", "Definitely NTA. Ashley is 15, Madison and James are 38. Ashley wasn't even alive when all this ended 20 years ago. 2 decades have passed since all this happened.

Madison did this to herself.", "NTA, people change after high school and the universe works itself out in many ways.  I remember a quote I read once \"You will always be the villain in someone's story\".  My guess would be that the guy could have cured cancer and saved a burning orphanage and she'd still consider him evil.  Some people need a dose of reality and that actions have consequences though and it seems like your sister is learning this with a shovel full to the face rather than a forkful of humble pie.", "NTA. Your sister did something absolutely disgusting and she deserves every negative consequence she gets. She bullied a kid mourning their dead father. She used someone else's grief as an opportunity to center herself and her own anger, while tarnishing a child's memory of a father they loved. She was an opportunistic and cruel stranger who shit on someone who never did anything to her, to get back at a man who was already dead. That is pathetic. Employers DO search social media and people WILL continue to judge your sister harshly for being a toxic bully. The fact that she is doubling down means she's deserving of whatever comes her way. Your parents should be ashamed of themselves and of her. Good for you, having the guts to say she was wrong.", "NTA. It's in poor taste to speak ill of the dead. Your sister found out the hard way.", "NTA \n\nBy your sisters logic she also won't be heading to the pearly gates when she dies. \n\nShe went out of her way to bully a grieving child wtf is wrong with her?!?!  She needs some serious therapy and if she can't see the wrong in what she did and apologise to Ashley then she deserves what ever repercussions she gets from this being posted online.", "maybe I\u2019m really wrong here, but it kinda seems like Madison bullied Ashley because of who here dad is, and during a time of acute grief, which is just as bad.

He\u2019s better off dead. If you bully someone to the point of affecting mental health you have pretty much lost all right to be treated or considered a decent human being. \n\nThat being said Madison is a grown woman who should know whether or not to use her \u201cinside\u201d voice or \u201cout loud\u201d voice by now.", "NTA. Your sister decided to bully a grieving child and try and get revenge on a dead man. I don't care what James put her through, that goes beyond the pale. She brought all this hate on herself.", "NTA. Madison had no business contacting the child of her bully, much less taking out her anger on the child for something her father did years ago when he was attending school. Her tirade accomplished nothing. She just created more problems for herself. The fact that she's had to endure so much hate online should tell her that she was out of line.\n\nI personally wouldn't apologize to her because she was so far out of line, it's indefensible. Whatever backlash she is suffering, she can only blame herself for. Being bullied as a child does not give a person the right to lash out and harm other people who had nothing to do with the bullying.", "NTA\n\nYou can apologize to your sister and still tell her that this was a big mistake, nobody messages their bully's kid.", "A **40 years old** grown ass woman bullying a grieving teenager because said grown ass woman went out looking to hurt her own damn feelings is the most disgusting and disturbed I\u2019ve read today.

Instead of using that to make sure she never becomes like her bullies she\u2019s dove right in headfirst to become the person she hated. **Gross**. \n\nI would be ashamed ofmy **40 year old sister**. I would be ashamed of my retired-ass parents for condoning my sisters horrible actions to a **literal CHILD**. I would go 100% no contact with such a sibling.

Your sister had no right to do what she did. \n\nShe\u2019s lost the moral high ground here by doing to Ashley *exactly* what James did to her for years. \n\nGiven the effect being bullied and mistreated by James had on her, she should be *even more* attuned to how important it is to be kind to others. \n\nGiven Ashley views her father positively, it sounds like he was able to reform himself and become a better person after high school. Isn\u2019t that what we should hope for when it comes to bullies?\n\nMy perspective on this is heavily influenced by a personal element. Maybe explaining this will help your sister to understand Ashley\u2019s perspective a little better.\n\nI happen to be related to some really awful people who\u2019ve done unspeakable things (including murder and rape, just to give you an idea). I won\u2019t be shedding any tears when they die.\n\nBut if someone were to message me after their deaths, and attribute their horrible behaviour to me, I would be deeply hurt.\n\nI\u2019m not an extension of them, just as Ashley isn\u2019t an extension of James.

Actions have consequences, no matter how brief the moment was. She was cruel to a young grieving girl for NO REASON. She now gets to lie in the bed she made for herself. She could have just scrolled past the post about his death, but no. There were so many steps she took to get where she was, it was not just a moment. She had to click on the girls page, go to message her, WRITE THE WHOLE THING, and then hit send. None of that was a moment. She made deliberate steps to bully a young girl.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA: She should absolutely take accountability and realize how petty and childish acting like that was.", "NTA. Let me point out that Madison was aware enough to send her reaction to Ashley as a DM, rather than publicly posting her reaction to her bully's death.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Exactly. Yes Madison was bullied in HS. Doesn't mean it is okay for her to bully an innocent child. \n\nMadison couldve ignored the post as no one was asking **her** for help on funeral expenses or anything like a scholarship to honor him.

Do you think it's okay to kick a child when they're down for your own selfish reasons?\n\nBeing drunk is never an excuse to hurt a child.
