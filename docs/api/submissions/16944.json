How your parents failed Stephen - and it he could have ended up better with different parents - is a question with no definite answer (it's all hypothetical), so naturally, that is what your family members are latching onto to attack you.\n\nIf you want to have a conversation about this, either with family or with your parents, you need to let go of the idea that they could have saved Stephen (that's all hypothetical) and you need to focus solely on your own experience. How were *you* effected by your parents (lack of) actions? Family will probably shut up quickly if you actually give a deeply personal, emotional and detailed account of the abuse you suffered. As for your parents, it would be an interesting test if they can can step up as parents and listen to you in a way that helps you heal rather than in a way that makes you feel worse.\n\nBut... it's slightly narcissistic that your parents are taking it *personally* that you have invited people *your own age* to be your children's guardians. Plenty of people make that choice, and plenty of grandparents understand why such a choice of guardians might be in the child's best interest. It's weird that your parents can't think of more \"innocent\" reasons why you have madet his choice, and had to make it about them.\n\nAnother retort towards family might be: \"So w*hat would you have me do, exactly? Are you proposing that I make my parents the legal guardians of my child? Are you proposing that if I die, my child should go to people that he has never spent the night with? Are you proposing that after my child has had to suffer through the trauma of having to bury his parents at a young age, that he should be sent to people so old that he is likely to have to go through the same trauma of burying his caretakers* again, *before he is even an adult? Are you proposing that I should make decisions that go against my child's best interest and against my wife's wishes, just to give my parents some closure? If know a lot of people with normal childhoods who have chosen guardians for their children who are the same age as them, and their parents don't take offense. Do you think those people are in the wrong? Or do you think it's people with happy childhoods should be allowed to choose guardians that are in their children's best interest, but that people who have had abusive childhoods must sacrifice their children to give their parents some closure?*\n\n*Yes, when my parents heard that they were not chosen for guardianship, they could only think of how this reflected on them. They could not perceive of any other reasons why I might have chosen the guardians that I chose. So when they confronted me about it, I realized they were so consumed with guilt that they had become incapable of seeing the bigger picture of my child's best interest. I realized that due to this trauma from their past, I did not trust them as parents, and I confirmed that to them. Now if you think after all this years, they can be healed, then I suggest you focus your efforts on them. But it will have to come from within themselves.* They *need to deal with their guilt in a healthy way.

Whether or not they chose to get that support so they could better care for (all) their children and themselves is not your responsibility. I'm not saying it's easy because I know personally that it isn't, but your parents made choices like not getting your brother help earlier and avoiding the situation that only made things worse.  Then they tried to offload your brother on to other family members instead of, perhaps, asking if you and your other brother would have wanted to go spend time with another family member while they worked with Stephen and found out if there was any intervention that could have helped him.

There is intense therapy that can be done to try to suppress urges or try to teach empathy, but no drugs or parenting are likely to completely suppress it. It is mostly genetic issues concerning neuronal wiring in the brain.", "OP clearly states in the post that they tried nothing. there are a great deal of interventions that can be tried in childhood - whether they ultimately prevent a diagnosis in adulthood or not (since this disorder is not diagnosed in minors) it\u2019s still the parents responsibility to seek treatment for their child, for his sake and his siblings. it\u2019s possible that his symptoms could have been reduced and that his behavior never would have gotten this bad with proper intervention.", "I think a big part of the issue here is not that the parents failed to correct Stephen's behavior, which may or may not have been possible.

Think about that next time someone makes you feel bad about your decision.", "NTA, quien tiene informaci\u00f3n de primera mano, \u00edntima  y totalmente fiable del tipo de crianza de tus padres y sus consecuencias eres tu, no los que no han vivido con  ustedes y solo los visitan\nNi amigos, ni parientes .... Nadie.\nNo han vivido con tus padres, no conocen a tus padres como t\u00fa y tus hermanos ... As\u00ed que su opini\u00f3n no es informada y no es requer\u00edda ... Porque les haces caso?", "Nta", "NTA\n\nYou are being a good parent. You know what your parents truly are like. Your parent's feelings do not Trump your son's welfare", "NTA \n\nYour parents failed you", "NTa, they may be victims, but that makes no difference in deciding who you trust your kids with", "Parents are supposed to keep their kids safe. They didn't do that for you. When I was a kid I remember my parents telling me that our family friend D would be my legal guardian if something happened to them. My mom's side of the family was horrible & qualified for each major cateogory of abuse when she was growing up and while my Dad's father was great his mother was emotionally abuse. She never one said \"I love you to him while he was growing up.\" Never. While a guardian raising your children should probably never happen it's better to make sure you have a good guardian set up (including legally) than chance your kids being raised by parents who couldn't handle it the first time around.", "Stop telling everyone everything.  What THEY don't know can't hurt You.  \"how are you?\"  Fine.  What have you been doing?\"   Nothing much.  \"Are the children busy over Easter week?\"  We were in a drug induced coma all week.   Sorry. Couldn't call.", "NTA Make sure your will states why. Talk to a lawyer about this. I lost custody of a friend\u2019s child because the judge overruled their will over guardianship. So the child ended up with the fanatical religious grandparents instead of me.  Despite the fact that the friend said in will that grandparents absolutely should not get custody but gave no reason.", "NTA, your parents suck. Not just for you and Dennis, but for Steven as well. He possibly wouldn't have had as many problems if they had actually parented and got him the help he needed. \n\n>I\u2019m sure you\u2019re questioning where our parents were and what they were doing during all of this. The answer is nothing: They refused to get psychiatric help for Stephen or seek out any other resources. They essentially stuck their heads in the sand until he was 14.\n\nThey don't deserve being covered for by your relatives and they don't know how to care for children. They refused to get your brother the help he desperately needed and are now reaping what they sow. Go NC with them.", "This is how it is. My situation isn't really the same, but the fact is that my mother was deeply depressed and unbelievably overwhelmed by having to raise five children, at least three neurodivergent, with little practical help from breadwinner dad. I have a lot of sympathy for what she went through. I don't have sympathy for the fact that she took it out on us, nor for the grim fact that she, an adult, made the decision to have more children than she was equipped to deal with.", "I wondered this also.", "This!  You are protecting your children from neglect at best.", "NTA who can set up for your kids with whom you feel safe. that having been said it seems like there is a lot more anger towards your parents still that you heavily restrict access to your kids and that should be a separate matter.", "NTA and don't forget that should your brother be released from prison, where do you think he will land? With his parents.\n\nKeep your children safe at all cost.", "This is an important point. My brother and SIL have, I'm fairly sure, chosen to assign guardianship of my niblings to my SIL's older sister in the event of their deaths. My mom lives nearby and loves the kids dearly, has been a wonderful grandmother to them and supported my brother/SIL in many ways - but she's also in her late 60s and has developed ongoing medical issues that would make being a primary caregiver to 2 young children pretty challenging for her. My SIL's older sister, however, is in her early 40s, has 2 kids about 5 years older than my niblings and has been a good mom to them. (I am childfree, a good \"fun auntie\" but not nearly responsible enough to be a good parent, and my life and living situation are not remotely compatible with kids. I'd do my best if it came down to it, obvs, but it'd be better for the niblings to live with their other auntie if at all possible.)\n\nJust because you trust someone with your kids in general doesn't mean they're the best caregivers for those kids on an ongoing basis.", "He says they tried nothing but he also says his brother refused therapy and medication. \n\nSo they tried *something*", "*As an adult* he refused therapy and medication.", "yes I think these commenters should reread the post. second paragraph: \u201c They refused to get psychiatric help for Stephen or seek out any other resources. They essentially stuck their heads in the sand until he was 14.\u201d (and then goes on to describe them handing over custody to others). third paragraph \u201cas an adult, he was diagnosed with a personality disorder (antisocial.) He refused therapy or medication.\u201d", "It said he was diagnosed with one thing at 15 and diagnosed with an additional thing as an adult. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t get a diagnosis without a doctor\u2019s visit. \n\nAgain, something was attempted.", "Not by them. His guardianship was signed over to the state right around the age of his diagnosis, after a year of him being passed around the family.", "At 15, he was already out of his parents' care. So the first diagnosis presumably dates to his time in foster care.", "Plus those under 18 are never given an ASPD diagnosis.  That's because the brain isn't fully developed for that kind of diagnosis.  You get that when you become a legal adult."]}
