At a certain point, nothing could be done because they did nothing and looked the other way until they kicked him out. Choosing to take no action is still a choice, and should you pass unexpectedly, there is a precedent that if there is a problem causing hurt to your children, they would ignore it, and if your children needed psychological help, they would ignore it, and if your kids' became a burden, they would be abandoned.
