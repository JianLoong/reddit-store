How your parents failed Stephen - and it he could have ended up better with different parents - is a question with no definite answer (it's all hypothetical), so naturally, that is what your family members are latching onto to attack you.\n\nIf you want to have a conversation about this, either with family or with your parents, you need to let go of the idea that they could have saved Stephen (that's all hypothetical) and you need to focus solely on your own experience. How were *you* effected by your parents (lack of) actions? Family will probably shut up quickly if you actually give a deeply personal, emotional and detailed account of the abuse you suffered. As for your parents, it would be an interesting test if they can can step up as parents and listen to you in a way that helps you heal rather than in a way that makes you feel worse.\n\nBut... it's slightly narcissistic that your parents are taking it *personally* that you have invited people *your own age* to be your children's guardians. Plenty of people make that choice, and plenty of grandparents understand why such a choice of guardians might be in the child's best interest. It's weird that your parents can't think of more \"innocent\" reasons why you have madet his choice, and had to make it about them.\n\nAnother retort towards family might be: \"So w*hat would you have me do, exactly? Are you proposing that I make my parents the legal guardians of my child? Are you proposing that if I die, my child should go to people that he has never spent the night with? Are you proposing that after my child has had to suffer through the trauma of having to bury his parents at a young age, that he should be sent to people so old that he is likely to have to go through the same trauma of burying his caretakers* again, *before he is even an adult? Are you proposing that I should make decisions that go against my child's best interest and against my wife's wishes, just to give my parents some closure? If know a lot of people with normal childhoods who have chosen guardians for their children who are the same age as them, and their parents don't take offense. Do you think those people are in the wrong? Or do you think it's people with happy childhoods should be allowed to choose guardians that are in their children's best interest, but that people who have had abusive childhoods must sacrifice their children to give their parents some closure?*\n\n*Yes, when my parents heard that they were not chosen for guardianship, they could only think of how this reflected on them. They could not perceive of any other reasons why I might have chosen the guardians that I chose. So when they confronted me about it, I realized they were so consumed with guilt that they had become incapable of seeing the bigger picture of my child's best interest. I realized that due to this trauma from their past, I did not trust them as parents, and I confirmed that to them. Now if you think after all this years, they can be healed, then I suggest you focus your efforts on them. But it will have to come from within themselves.* They *need to deal with their guilt in a healthy way.

Whether or not they chose to get that support so they could better care for (all) their children and themselves is not your responsibility. I'm not saying it's easy because I know personally that it isn't, but your parents made choices like not getting your brother help earlier and avoiding the situation that only made things worse.  Then they tried to offload your brother on to other family members instead of, perhaps, asking if you and your other brother would have wanted to go spend time with another family member while they worked with Stephen and found out if there was any intervention that could have helped him.

There is intense therapy that can be done to try to suppress urges or try to teach empathy, but no drugs or parenting are likely to completely suppress it. It is mostly genetic issues concerning neuronal wiring in the brain.", "OP clearly states in the post that they tried nothing. there are a great deal of interventions that can be tried in childhood - whether they ultimately prevent a diagnosis in adulthood or not (since this disorder is not diagnosed in minors) it\u2019s still the parents responsibility to seek treatment for their child, for his sake and his siblings. it\u2019s possible that his symptoms could have been reduced and that his behavior never would have gotten this bad with proper intervention.", "I think a big part of the issue here is not that the parents failed to correct Stephen's behavior, which may or may not have been possible.

Your parents' feelings, their desire to have the children more aren't even a close second consideration.\n* Your parents have a demonstrated history of NOT being able to handle either a child in crisis or the protection of children being affected by a crisis. In the case of you and your husband's deaths, your children would most definitely be in a state of crisis and need additional support and emotional wherewithal. Your folks cannot be counted on to provide that.\n* Even if you didn't have that history, you could believe that your parents are too old, or too physical or emotionally lacking to give your kids what they need. That is your call. You have to choose what you think is best for your children.\n\n**Do your parents deserve some sympathy?**\n\n* Sure, your parents were victims of the situation - having such an emotionally disturbed child unexpectedly turned their world upside down. It was hard to even recognize the severity of the issue at first, much less know how to effectively deal with it. You can have sympathy for the challenging hand they were dealt.\n* BUT you and Dennis were not just victims - like your parents - of the challenge of an emotionally/mentally disturbed family member. You were also victims of your parents' spectacular failure to protect you and Dennis,, to take the steps needed to recognize and at least try to address your brother's dysfunction. If your feelings of hurt, neglect, frustration, anger etc. from their (in)action are greater than any sympathy you have for the challenge they faced - well it is no one else's place to judge whether that is right or wrong. No one else (but Dennis) has been in your shoes.\n* I do think it's important for you to note whether your parents have acknowledged and apologized for their failure to deal with things in the past; whether they are trying their best to do right in the present, knowing that they cannot change the past. From the post, it doesn't seem like they have done these things. But if they have, then I think there's something to be gained by giving them some grace.\n\n**Do they deserve some grandparenting joy?**\n\n* Of course, if you have any concerns about their judgement and ability/willingness to take care of the safety and well-being of your chldren now, they should not be given the grandparent opportunities they crave.\n* Maybe your experience under their parenting is so traumatic that you cannot ever have the generational connection or allow that connection with your children. Then the damage your parents caused you is more than you can recover from and they must accept this distance as an on-going consequence of their past choices.\n* If they have taken those steps to acknowledge, apologize and do right going forward, and you can see that, then there may be some things you find you can allow your parents to enjoy with your children (smaller interactions, from which trust can slowly be built). I'm not saying they have; just addressing the possibility.\n\nI'm sorry for the rough times in your life and its lingering impacts on you now.", "NTA they are shitty parents", "It doesn't matter if your parents were victims.", "Great perspective and very nicely written (and accurate) I actually hope OP uses your writing to address the other family members.

Second, it's not purely a genetic disorder. I'm not trying to blame the parents necessarily for the cause of the issue, but it often manifests in people with genetic predispositions who then undergo traumatic childhoods. Not to say that OP's parents were necessarily the cause of that trauma, but there's certainly evidence that early intervention after trauma can help prevent that from manifesting.

No acknowledgment of what Dennis and I went through.", "Thankfully for everyone, it is unlikely that Stephen will ever get released after what he's done. By the time he was 19, prison was truly the only place for him.", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gotten plenty of responses by now but a as a mental health professional, APD doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. You aren\u2019t born with it like something like ADHD or autism which seems to be what your family is suggesting. Your parents\u2019 penchant for neglect very likely contributed to this situation and I think you\u2019re doing a great thing for your child and your own sanity by keeping him away from your parents.", "His first diagnosis was conduct disorder at 15. The state provided that medical consultation for Stephen after my parents had signed over guardianship. My parents had not taken him to any kind of mental health professional.\n\nStephen received his antisocial personality disorder diagnosis from a different psychiatrist after his first time getting arrested as an adult at 18.\n\nI'm sure that the first psychiatrist saw the early signs of antisocial personality disorder. But, as you said, they legally cannot diagnose it until someone is 18. And since he was a legal adult, they couldn't force him to go through with medication or therapy."]}
