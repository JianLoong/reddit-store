Most people tend to think of the big bulky picture ones, but they've come out with phone sized ones, and most of them include a typing option (like the novachat 5). Then you can have a designated device that isn't a phone and paperwork that forces them to let you use it, or the school sets themselves up for legal trouble.\n\nEven if you don't get it through the school itself, there's a good chance the school SLP can help you find resources for funding or even getting your insurance to pay for it.", "You need an IEP.

If you have an IEP and they refuse to allow you to use the methods specified to notify them, then they're an asshole, but wanting to know where students under their care are is not unreasonable, and is something they're meant to be doing as part of their job. \n\nNAH here for me.

I actually found more relevant information when looking up accommodations for deaf students.\n\nSome accommodations that are available to deaf people are: sign language interpreters, scribes/notetakers, various speech to text services, assisted listening systems, extended time on assessment tasks, additional assistance, additional drafts, use of glossaries and dictionaries. You don't need all of those or need variations of them, but you are just as entitled to them as a deaf person is to the things that are appropriate for them. \n\nI would suggest communicating with your doctor to get medical support for the use of accommodations, and in particular I'd encourage you to consider: you having and using flash cards for common words or phrases, assistive technology for text to speech either your phone or the school or your parents providing an alternative, placement in classes with teachers who know sign language where possible, a teachers aide where it's helpful, additional assistance and time for assessment tasks, use of glossaries and dictionaries in assessment tasks (and in general, but also in assessment where you wouldn't be otherwise allowed), and I'd suggest developing some sort of process for things that have caused friction i.e. permission to go to the bathroom - how that should be handled and so on. I understand you not wanting to have to come up to the board in front of the whole class, but you are still probably going to be expected to ask, so how do you want that to happen? A flashcard might be the fastest and quietest way for you to do it, so have it put in that that is the method you are to use. \n\nAnd when I say 'you need to develop' or 'you should put in', please be aware that I mean that adults who are working with you and advocating for you should be doing this, in consultation with yourself at your age. My biggest worry from your post is that you don't seem to have any particularly involved adults advocating for you here. It's really concerning to me that your parents have not pushed for an IEP. Do you have a school counselor or school nurse that you can communicate with? It might be helpful for you to pick out some stuff from this post, and take that to them to help you communicate with them.\n\nI also wanted to add that the experience of being treated as if you're intellectually disabled even when your disability isn't intellectual is extremely common. That's how some people understand disability and it absolutely sucks. Abelism is something you will have to deal with in life unfortunately. It isn't fair or right anymore than other forms of discrimination are.

The only rule is she can\u2019t be texting or watching videos at school.  If that happens she would have to use a school provided iPad with only a communication program on it.  She prefers her phone so it hasn\u2019t been a issue.  \n\nTeachers do not have the authority to say yes or no so I would start with the principal then progress to the superintendent and school board if need be.

We had a few regular customers that were Deaf.  It was so incredibly difficult to have a conversation about their prescription, to answer their questions, to clarify things they were confused about.  We both had to write down what we were saying, since they couldn't really speak verbal English, which you don't realize how much longer it takes, as opposed to speaking.\n\nI understand that in OP's case, only he would be the one writing things down.

I would expect that a teacher could keep a cheat sheet on her desk, or another student could translate for her. This is likely the least ridiculous thing that the teacher will be asked to do for an IEP. I am not even close to being fluent in Spanish,  but I know a few phrases, and I learned a few more for my students.

Its a safety issue at the very least - who will know where to look for you in the event of an emergency. It\u2019s just basic respect to give a note to your teacher to let her know you need to leave. Are you going to walk out of meetings at work whenever you like with no explanation? Of course not. \nMy daughter has issues with mental health.

From a teacher perspective it's a complicated issue. They have a legal duty to keep you safe as well as having access to an education.

I rarely let my students out as it is their responsibility to sort themselves out during the breaks. Unless it's a medical emergency or they have been requested to be pulled out by management.\n\nI think it is unreasonable to expect your teacher to know ASL for one student, writing it down sound like a good compromise to me.

The fact that young adults need to ask permission to go to the bathroom is ridiculous. I wouldn't even make small kids ask for permission.

If nothing happens, you come back and put the note away. That suggestion is far more lame than many of the others who have experienced this, so don\u2019t use mine.
