If you have an IEP and they refuse to allow you to use the methods specified to notify them, then they're an asshole, but wanting to know where students under their care are is not unreasonable, and is something they're meant to be doing as part of their job. \n\nNAH here for me.

I actually found more relevant information when looking up accommodations for deaf students.\n\nSome accommodations that are available to deaf people are: sign language interpreters, scribes/notetakers, various speech to text services, assisted listening systems, extended time on assessment tasks, additional assistance, additional drafts, use of glossaries and dictionaries. You don't need all of those or need variations of them, but you are just as entitled to them as a deaf person is to the things that are appropriate for them. \n\nI would suggest communicating with your doctor to get medical support for the use of accommodations, and in particular I'd encourage you to consider: you having and using flash cards for common words or phrases, assistive technology for text to speech either your phone or the school or your parents providing an alternative, placement in classes with teachers who know sign language where possible, a teachers aide where it's helpful, additional assistance and time for assessment tasks, use of glossaries and dictionaries in assessment tasks (and in general, but also in assessment where you wouldn't be otherwise allowed), and I'd suggest developing some sort of process for things that have caused friction i.e. permission to go to the bathroom - how that should be handled and so on. I understand you not wanting to have to come up to the board in front of the whole class, but you are still probably going to be expected to ask, so how do you want that to happen? A flashcard might be the fastest and quietest way for you to do it, so have it put in that that is the method you are to use. \n\nAnd when I say 'you need to develop' or 'you should put in', please be aware that I mean that adults who are working with you and advocating for you should be doing this, in consultation with yourself at your age. My biggest worry from your post is that you don't seem to have any particularly involved adults advocating for you here. It's really concerning to me that your parents have not pushed for an IEP. Do you have a school counselor or school nurse that you can communicate with? It might be helpful for you to pick out some stuff from this post, and take that to them to help you communicate with them.\n\nI also wanted to add that the experience of being treated as if you're intellectually disabled even when your disability isn't intellectual is extremely common. That's how some people understand disability and it absolutely sucks. Abelism is something you will have to deal with in life unfortunately. It isn't fair or right anymore than other forms of discrimination are.

It\u2019s not at all unreasonable to expect they\u2019d each learn the few signs they\u2019d need to know for basic accommodations, at the very least. The couple of signs for \u201crestroom\u201d are super easy to learn, for instance. Even just learning to finger spell would go very far in helping you to communicate with them. Will your parents go to the school and advocate for you? At the very least leaning the signs for \u201ctoilet\u201d, \u201cnurse\u201d, and \u201cprincipal\u201d should be mandatory for the teachers.", "It\u2019s actually quite dangerous. This leads to kids not trusting and confiding in their parents. Sometimes driving them into the arms of abusers who prey on kids/people from families with poor dynamics and lack of social support.\nNever tell your kids to \u201cjust obey\u201d any adult unless you have explicit knowledge of the situation and have already devised a plan with the adult and the child.\nThis is how you get your kids abused and taken advantage of their entire lives.", "Why is it ok for the teacher to make a spectacle out of every other student who wants to use the bathroom? Are you saying no student should have to say the words, \"May I use the restroom?\" Are you saying no student should ever have to ask permission to leave the classroom?", "My fourth grade teacher taught us the sign for the letter T. If we needed a bathroom break (T = toilet), we just did that sign and she'd give permission immediately. She even told us, \"if I'm helping one of your classmates with something and you need to go, just come do that sign behind them and I will probably tell you yes immediately. You don't need to wait to ask to go to the bathroom.\"\n\nI cannot remember a single time I was told no. She probably only made us ask so she would be aware if we weren't in the classroom, so she could make sure we came back or knew where we were if there was an emergency.", "Um no. It\u2019s totally different. I\u2019m sure the other students are well aware he cannot speak", "Also, OP could just have a few printed cards or whatever with some common reasons why they want to leave the classroom. Just hold one up instead of raising your hand or showing it to the teacher after they come to you / you went to them and the teacher can let you know if / when you can leave. How difficult can this be?\n\nI have a few students with special needs in my classes and a few of them have a time-out card they can show me when they need a break. They give me the card and they can leave the classroom, no questions asked. But I would be concerned if they would just leave without saying anything.", "I'm one of them who had that accommodation. I have bladder issues and had a note from a doctor that allowed me to leave class when I needed because I needed to be able to go immediately and also had scheduled times to go. I never had to ask.\n\nI wouldn't give a Y T A verdict because the school and his mom is failing OP. Clearly communication is an issue and it should have already been addressed. OP is frustrated with their inability to communicate and no adults seem to be trying to make it easier.", "I never had to ask to leave the classroom in high school. I never had to give a reason. Even in middle school. After lower school (which is for safety), we never had to ask to leave the room. This was pre-2010 \n\nIts so insane to me that students had to ask and teachers could say no.", "Because I wouldn't want my teacher to have to stop lecturing when anyone in the fucking class needs to go take a piss.   \n\n\nWant people to act like adults? Treat them like adults.", "If your teachers are being difficult about your accommodations, PLEASE talk to your counselor (if 504) or case manager (if IEP). I am a special ed teacher and case manager, and I make sure that all of my students\u2019 teachers are fully aware of their accommodations\u2026. But I know that not all case managers are as adamant about it as I am, and with the number of students in gen ed classes these days, it\u2019s easy for a teacher to miss your accommodations page if there isn\u2019t someone to (for lack of a better phrase) shove it in their face. Our school information system makes it like a 10-step process for teachers to view a student\u2019s accommodations\u2026. I am sure that many of them can\u2019t even keep track of where to go to see the accommodations. \n\nMy recommendation is that you ask someone to print enough copies of your accommodations for every teacher and an additional copy for you. Take a few minutes to have a 1 on 1 conversation with each teacher and explain that you have a 504/IEP and give them your accommodations page. Teachers love when students advocate for themselves like this. It\u2019s even more effective when you explain how your disability affects you (I have trouble reading out loud; I need to reread sentences/paragraphs multiple times to comprehend them, so it takes me longer; I need to see information written down to fully understand/remember it; I need a calculator for my algebra test; etc.).", "Regardless of this situation, there are plenty of valid reasons to call a minor an AH if they are being one. \ud83d\ude1d", "Everyone has to ask to leave the classroom, he's mad he doesn't get to do whatever he wants, that's not ableism", "This is such an abelist comment, OP don't listen to this! 100% NTA. Your school, your teacher and, tbh, your mom have all failed to provide you with adequate accommodations. I hope that you are able to use this experience to request the accommodations that you need to function at your best in school.

Im not sure what else OP would be doing or be allowed to do. I had a note in middle school and high school that allowed me to use the bathroom whenever I wanted without asking. I was on a timed peeing schedule and needed to be able to go when I needed to, even if it was between scheduled times. I had a lot of urinary issues/retention/infection and school design made them worse. I wouldn't be surprised if schools caused some of these issues in healthy kids because of their controlling bs.", "Yep, teachers are legally responsible for their students and knowing where they are is a MUST. And since I don't see another way for OP to communicate that asking him to write it down makes sense. I don't understand why OP doesn't simply write it down, raise his hand to get the teacher's attention and then show them the paper. I'm missing why they think just walking out is the only way.\n\nThe teachers who let OP just leave are AH tho.", "That's my thing. I've never had a teacher allow any student to just walk out of class.", "For a short period of time in hs, I had a pass from the counselor that let me leave class whenever I wanted to to go speak with them. I usually only went during 3rd period and I had let that teacher know one time, and we had a mutual understanding that I could leave class. I didn\u2019t have to ask every time because there was no point in making me uncomfortable and having to announce it. \n\n\nI also had a classmate who ended up needing help getting from class to class because they injured their leg/ankle in both 8th, 9th and 12th grade. Due to her injury and needing assistance with her books etc, she would leave class 5-10 minutes early and didn\u2019t have to keep telling or asking the teacher. It was routine and a volunteer was usually the same kid or it was discussed earlier in class so it wasn\u2019t a disruption.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for teachers to be aware of a situation and not make a kid have to bring it up every time or draw attention to themselves. The teacher is just power tripping and being difficult- every other teacher has a mutual understanding with OP except them", "You should definitely have access to AAC. Why hasn\u2019t the school giving you some sort of communicative device?", "Letting the teacher know why you're leaving is a totally normal thing to do. He could at least raise his hand first, so she knows what's happening", "God some of my college classes in 2016 had chalk boards", "What century are you from? My university had chalkboards lmao. One of my professors even brought out an overhead which I hadn't seen since elementary school.\n\nI've watched lectures from ivy league schools where there are still chalkboards.\n\nMy high school still had some when I was going 10 years ago though they switched to smart boards to make it fair after they built a new high school.\n\nI guess you went to school in a priveleged area.

That seems a lot more private.", "That is what literally everyone else in the class does though?", "I mean, nuts to what you want, then, I guess?\n\nThat's high school for you, kids can't just be walking out of class without saying anything.", "hey, thank you so, so much!!  this is very helpful and sweet of you to write", "They\u2019re old enough to operate a pencil and paper, no?", "So you just want to leave class because?

Honestly I say just keep doing what you\u2019re doing, show your mom this sub and tell her this is one of those times the adult is in the wrong and you need her to support you, and if the teacher ever tries to involve the principal, you say \u201cBet.

She ought to do as she's told, and get him some help.\n\nIf the parent is difficult, the teacher should still be finding ways to communicate with OP that are not so distracting to the rest of the class/embarrassing for OP. The solution isn't to let OP just leave whenever. Its to learn one sign for bathroom so OP can let her know he needs to leave. She could be shown it once and should be able to figure it out.
