Most people tend to think of the big bulky picture ones, but they've come out with phone sized ones, and most of them include a typing option (like the novachat 5). Then you can have a designated device that isn't a phone and paperwork that forces them to let you use it, or the school sets themselves up for legal trouble.\n\nEven if you don't get it through the school itself, there's a good chance the school SLP can help you find resources for funding or even getting your insurance to pay for it.", "You need an IEP.
