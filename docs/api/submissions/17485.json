Its not at all unreasonable for a teacher to want a high school student, any student, to ask to leave the classroom, and then indicate why they're leaving the classroom. One of OPs comments said that he was asked to write his reason on the board, and that would certainly be too much, but the original post said that the teacher would also accept a gesture indicating their reason, which seems just fine.", "This is a little tough. I think either NAH or ESH. I don\u2019t like calling minors AHs, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad person or anything, but I kind of see where she\u2019s coming from. If you were to leave and not return or something were to happen, like a fire alarm, she would be responsible for you. I understand her wanted/needing to know when you\u2019re leaving and why you\u2019re leaving. However, she\u2019s significantly more the AH because she is not trying to understand and help you in this situation. She absolutely, as an educator, should be working towards accommodations for her students. I would absolutely email your teacher and outline a reasonable accommodation that you think could work for both of you. Leaving whenever you feel like it isn\u2019t a reasonable accommodation. Maybe a different amount of fingers when raising your hands means different things. Maybe laminated color coded small cards, etc. if she continues to actively not help you, you should talk to your counselor, vice principal, or someone who can help you get the accommodations you need.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say YTA. I have never heard of a high school student, needing accommodations or not, being able to just walk out of the room in the middle of class just because you\u2019ll \u201ccome back.\u201d Do other students get the same treatment? Or do they have to raise their hand and publicly state why they would like to leave the room. How is writing \u201cI need to use the bathroom\u201d on a scrap of paper and handing it to your teacher insulting? The teacher isn\u2019t calling you stupid or insinuating you are because you are mute just by wanting to know where you are going while you are her responsibility. What if there is an family emergency and the principal is looking for you. They know you\u2019re supposed to be in Mrs. X\u2019s class, if they come to that classroom it would not be an acceptable answer for her to shrug and say \u201cidk OP just walks out of the room whenever they please.\u201d That\u2019s her job on the line.", "YTA. The world wont bend to your will and whim because you want it to. How do you plan on having a job? You can't expect everyone to be okay with you randomly walking away without an explanation, its rude in society and if you want to be in society, you have to be polite. When ANYONE walks out of the room/a table/whatever, it is polite to say, \"I'll be right back, need to use the restroom\" or whatever. You don't just walk up and leave. Its entitlement on your end also to expect others to learn another language for you. Would it be cool? Yes, is it required, nah. You having a disability isn't an excuse for bad behavior, my teenager is in the deaf and hard of hearing community and is fluent in ASL due to severe hearing problems, not only does she not expect everyone to know ASL, but figured out life on how she can adapt, not the other way around.
