There is no need for him to own part of your home. \n\nIf you NEEDED renovations, you could get a loan in your name only using the house as collateral. So this idea that the only way is to take out a mortgage in his name, thereby being forced to put his name on the deed, is a bit suspect. Especially it sounds like these are not even necessary renovations. \n\nYou don't give any details about how paying off his debts led to him have nothing left from the sale of his condo, but that jumped out at me. It could be totally normal if he didn't live there long and paid off student loans. But if he has a history of accumulating debt, I would extra careful of giving him legal rights to your house or taking on any kind of joint debt.\n\nMake sure you are checking your credit score regularly. I hate to be suspicious, but your house is a significant asset and you have a child to think of.", "NTA he sold his property, and paid off his debts?

He can go out and buy any *other*  real estate his little heart desires. \n\nIf your husband wants to renovate the house he lives in, well, he can take out a different kind of loan or pay for with it with his bigger salary. Or he can suck it up and live in a perfectly nice house. \n\nNTA I think your concerns are valid. Better safe than sorry, ya know?", "NTA.  This is a backhanded way of getting himself added to the deed.  Don't do it.  Once he's on that deed that's it - he owns half your house.  He knew when you married the house was yours and he had no problem with it.  He can't circle back now and demand your property.  Hard no.", "Nta - if the renovations are so important to him then he can pay for them out of pocket. Getting a mortgage on a house that is already paid off for a matter like this is ridiculous. Do not let him pressure you into this, it is not financially sound nor is it in your best interest.\n\nEdited for typo", "NTA. Don't budge on this. He makes double what you make and had a condo to sell and still only broke even after paying off debt?

One who YOU hire, YOU pay for (not him!) and YOU get advice from! \n\nIt is **probably not true** that you \"need to give him half the house to get a mortgage.\" At least it isn't in Massachusetts, which is where I live. I do a lot in real estate and my family writes mortgages for a living.  It may be perfectly possible for him to be a \"co-borrower\" and not a \"co-owner.\"", "This is super sus. He signed a prenup acknowledging he is to have no claim on the house and now because the house is now worth nearly 1 mill he wants to \"renovate\" and get a mortgage and having an issue with his name not on the house.

I don't want to assign motives here, but if you want to retain that property in case of a potential divorce, don't do anything that adds his name to the deed.  \n\nSuggest that you pay for the renovations in cash, that way you can tell whether or not he really wants to renovate or just get his name on the deed.", "Don't put him on the deed. Watch out for yourself and your daughter's future. NTA", "NTA, no, No, NO! do not let his name go on the house. If he wants to renovate so bad let him take out a loan on his own.

I bet as soon as you got the mortgage he would divorce you and make you sell and give him half.", "NTA but I do you have two questions. The first is if you want to do renovations or if this is just for him. The second is why doing renovations would require you to put him on the mortgage. Normally you could just get a line of credit or home equity loan, but really not a big deal.\n\nOne other thing, no matter what you decide to do you should wait, because right now interest rates are very high.", "NTA don't do this, this gives him right to your house but still means you have no right to any future property he gets, your parent wouldn't want you to do this", "NTA - you considered the idea and decided against it. Unless he can sign something that makes it so he can't claim it in the event of a divorce or puts your name on his assets in the equivalent of what the house is worth, don't do it. Your gut says no, listen to it.", "NTA. It's strange that all the sudden he is pushing for this.  See if you can get the mortgage in just your name. If you can't, then save money and update the house one room at a time.  If you even want to do that anyway.", "Nta, don't do it, cover your own ass", "NTA. houses serve a purpose - protect you from the elements and provide a hub for you to live your life. Taking an unnecessary mortgage means you have to work for the house now. You should only have a mortgage to buy the house.

You need to check and confirm that his name HAS to be added to obtain a mortgage, I don't think you do and if so, he's scamming you to get on the title.

Your statement that he automatically gets half is not correct and depends on where you are. In the US, it's possible to own a smaller part of a property. Let's say your home is worth 850k and he's willing to put 150k into renovations. An attorney could assist with ensuring he only owned 15% of the property. \n\nThe reason why I would caution again adding him at all is the complexity of untangling that ownership if you did split up. You could have a post-nup (yes, it's a thing) that says you have the right to buy out his 15% or whatever if you choose and how that value would be determined.\n\nUltimately, there are ways but legal paperwork is never fun and you shouldn't feel forced into it.", "NTA. Not unless he hands you $500k first.

Go to the bank and find out what you alone are eligible for, and determine whether you can afford to make the payments. You could also talk to a lawyer about him buying in to ownership of the house. If he wants to pay you half of the current market value, you could come up with a contract that allows him to make payments directly to you.

Speak to a lawyer. Perhaps you can draw up an agreement and have on the title that x% is your sole separate property and y% is joint property. In the agreeement you should write that you make all decisions of any sale.\n\nBy renovations, do you mean repairs, or making changes to the basic house such as adding rooms? If it is just renovations, pay for it out of income, do not take a mortgage.", "NTA and nope nope nope. This is a *no so subtle* way to co-own your property with all that it implies.

I mean, he\u2019s your husband not your tenet. \n\nI don\u2019t think it was a wise move to put a clause in the prenup that allows him to buy a property after the marriage and only have it in his name.

Assuming your husband isn't a comic book villain (never certain), it sounds like your goals are to protect yourself in the case of a divorce and to provide an inheritance to your daughter. Both of those can be accomplished while also taking out a joint loan for renovation, if that's something you and your husband want to do- but I think that's the crux of the issue. You say that you're both happy with a house that hasn't been updated since 1995; is that really true for him as well? If he makes enough money for renovations and wants them, I don't know that it's unreasonable for him to have a say in his living space, and that's possible to arrange fairly without you giving up your equity. It also sounds like he's unhappy living in a house he has no rights to; perhaps he feels dependent on you (what happens to him in a divorce?), or like he can't customize his living space. There are emotional issues with prenups that aren't necessarily rational; he might not feel like you trust him. I would also be curious to what level your finances are otherwise joint and whether he is interested in adopting your daughter. Ultimately, it's your house and you should definitely not compromise that- but as his wife, you should also be mindful of his feelings and try to find a solution. \n\nTL;DR: On a practical level, all of this can be fixed.

He has made his intentions clear. He is trying to bypass the prenup.\n\nLook at what he said. First, he wanted to do renovations. OK. That's not unusual. Then he has to go on the deed for these. That could be understandable, investing in a property and gaining some ownership is not unheard of. Then, when you push back, he let his real reason out, he calls you and A. H. for not wanting him to also own the house. So everything was to get his name on the deed. \n\nI would begin to worry about about marital debt if you are not tracking it now. There's two scenarios that could be playing out:\n\n1. He's feeling like he is a guest in the home you live in.\n2. He's planning something and it involves a half million from your house.\n\nI'm leaning towards 2 because of the underhand way he tried to maneuver around the prenup. You signed a prenup for a reason.

There is something weird going on.", "Currently he has no debts at all, he recently bought a very expensive car, but other than his car he has nothing to pay.", "Listen to your gut. \n\nCheck your credit score (and your child's) \n\nConsider putting important legal documents (deed to the house, copy of the prenup, copy of your will, your birth certificate, your child's birth certificate, etc. in a safety deposit box at a bank. \n\nNot sure what your reproductive situation is, but make sure you are doing what you need to do to avoid an unplanned pregnancy.", "I'm jumping on here because it reads that he sold his condo but STILL has nothing from that though he makes 2x what you do. \ud83e\udd14 So a lot of times other debt gets wrapped up in a mortgage.  Don't do this. Your gut is warning you something is wrong. This feels very off. He could legally end up stealing your daughter's future security. Even if you'd risk it all for love if it was only you to consider, it's NOT only you. Good luck. Something is hidden here...", "Always trust your gut.\n\nNTA", "Your instincts know something is off, you feel like you can't quite put your finger on it?\n\nI guarantee you that it will suddenly jump out at you and you'll kick yourself for not seeing it sooner. Your instincts are there to warn you even if they can't give specifics.\n\nOn the off chance you're wrong, nothing bad will happen if you don't renovate the house. If he earns twice as much as you and is so desperate then he can pay for what he wants done. If he is cagey about it and says no because if you broke up he would have lost the money then you can flip that back on him to say why does he want to go on the mortgage if he thinks there's a chance of a divorce.", "I have a bad feeling he has piled on some additional debts. Once he gets his name on the deed he can get money against the house in dubious ways. \n\nSorry OP, for me being so suspicious of your husband, but this is a huge red flag.", "OP, I work for an estate planning attorney. My advice to you is call one. Do not let him tell you that his name has to be added to the house to take out a mortgage because, to my experience (I am not an attorney), that isn\u2019t true. He\u2019s trying to get a share of your premarital assets. Your alarm bells are ringing for good reason. If you don\u2019t know where to start looking for a good attorney, search through your state\u2019s bar association or through naela.org and whoever you call through there can give you a recommendation.", "If he's making that much money, and you don't have a house payment, it sounds like the two of you should be stacking up money pretty quickly. Better to throw that in a savings account or the like where you're getting 4.5% interest all day, and just fixing the place up incrementally. That seems preferable to financing renovations with a loan (7.5% going the *other* way), especially since there doesn't seem to be any particular, urgent need for any renovations.\n\nThis is not at all the time to be taking out a HELOC or the like. Material and labor costs are sky-high as is the cost of borrowing.", "It would feel like a red flag to me too.", "And to add I don\u2019t understand his comment about you being an ass for not wanting him to own the house that is part of the prenup that he didn\u2019t put anything into.  The house is YOURS and he should have no say whatsoever on it.  Do NOT put his name on the deed.   Something is off here and I\u2019m wondering if this is his way of trying to circumvent the prenup since he\u2019d be able to say you \u201cwillingly\u201d put his name on the deed?\n\nI just read a story on here where the wife and husband divorced with a prenup that she owned the house but he put substantial renovations into it so she ended up having to pay him out like 200k for that for her to keep the house so that may be affecting my thinking on this.   Trust your gut", "Go with  your gut!!!", "She isn't planning on moving so what's the point? If she wanted to sell then fine, but increasing value on something you won't sell is ridiculous.", "Every comment you make there is another red flag!

That is not normal!     \nHe is very clearly planning to take your home away from you.", "Wait that last sentence is REALLY IMPORTANT INFO and a giant glaring parade of red flags.", "Okay now I don't trust your husband at all. Who in the hell we finances alone to what has to be a higher interest rate. I don't know what's going on with him.\n\nYou sound American so I just made that assumption because in the United States  your husband does not have to be on your mortgage. I mean the bank will want it but they don't have to have it.\n\nHonestly, if I were you, I would be thinking about divorce right now because not only does he think you're stupid but he wants to take advantage of that stupidity.\n\nEdit because I keep talking into my phone.", "Run, his intentions are not pure.", "This man wants half a million dollars from you one way or the other.", "How much does he want to borrow? How expensive are these renovations? It might be better (**IF** you chose to go ahead with this) to get a personal loan, not a mortgage.     \nAlso, what if you got a mortgage in your name? He wouldn't have to be added to the deed for that.      \nWhatever you do, get professional legal advice. But this sounds fishy.", "Fair enough. If you truly want to do renovations another way would be adding a line of credit on your house, which allows it to stay in your name. The downside is, you would be responsible for the debt.  Good luck!", "I live in B.C.. I signed to be on a mortgage with my husband but am not on the deed to the house. My husband is a control freak about money and we borrowed money from his parents for part of the down payment. I didn't worry about it because we are a community property province. I would have a record of paying part of the mortgage and would be entitled to 50% anyway. Forty years later, we're still married and my name is on everything. NTA.", "Well there ya go.  He deceived you when he went into this marriage.  I'd lock that house down - see a lawyer.", "Wow. If he's already talking about \"fighting the prenup\" then he has already put thought into this.     \nI'd consider locking your credit, and monitoring the house title. In the UK (where I am) you can get the official Land Registry to alert you if anyone tries to do any sort of transaction on your home. Being that he lives in the home and could intercept mail it would not be totally impossible that he could forge your signature and get his name on the deed.      \nHe's already thinking about this. You need to do the same.", "Trust your gut. Our heart often leads us places where we get in trouble, listen to your gut as well.", "He's already thinking of divorce if he is talking about how he would fight you for the gaining capital. Get a lawyer, at least for a one hour consult. NOW.", "Can you ask him to do a credit check? Like make sure he hasn't secretly run up debts?\n\nI don't want to upset you, but with your other comments I am suspicious he has run up debts, is doing something expensive (e.g. drugs or sports car enthusiast) or he has someone else and wants to have enough money for a fresh start.\n\nI can't think of any other reason.\n\nI don't know how it works where you are, can you have a text conversation with your brother about your husband saying this? So if he tries you can show it was premeditated and he is being dishonest.", "You do NOT have a solid marriage. He\u2019s planning to fight you and take your house from you in court!", "Lady, get your head out of your ass. He is playing you. Probably has been the entire relationship. Keep the blinders on and you are going to lose your home", "Yikes. Looks like he is already thinking about a divorce, making an exit plan.\n\nGood that you are meeting with a lawyer, make sure there are no loopholes.", "Does he handle most of the cooking?", "Dude!  He\u2019s running up debts with some secret vice or planning to screw you over the house. Please, OP.  Don\u2019t do this.  Every comment you have added is another red flag.  He got your house appraised.  He\u2019d fight you for the added value of your house?  WTF.", "NTA and that's a great plan. Don't let your husband steal your house.", "NAH.  Okay, based on what you are saying, it sounds like the house is never going to be really be his home.  You are going to control everything about it.  So, if he doesn\u2019t like the wall color, floors, etc. He\u2019s will have to live with it unless you decide you want a change unless he wants to put money in at a loss.  Also, you can decide to sell it whether or not he agrees to fund your daughter\u2019s life.\n\nHonestly, that would be a pretty big pill to swallow for most people.", "This \ud83d\udcaf%", "He wants a renovated place. Why would he put money into a place that he does not own. So she sells the place and pockets most of the money and buys a place with him or rents it out so that they can get a new place together. Why would you not want your spouse to be happy in their home, why get married at all.", "Well, it\u2019s very strange.\n\nI saw one of your other comments about him getting the house appraised \u201cfor fun\u201d. You don\u2019t do that for fun. You do that when you want to try and sell, or for insurance purposes. Since it\u2019s your house, I\u2019m guessing you pay the insurances\u2026so I find it all very suspicious", "I don\u2019t know about other countries, but in my country, when the not-owning partner puts money towards maintenance and other house related costs, that partner gets a claim on the property. So, no, consult a lawyer before letting the partner contribute", "Oh boy, this just broke my heart, I hope he is not in trouble or planing something that bad. I will talk to him, I think this is very valid and maybe a talk about this should happen.", "No\u2026 lol he can burn boiling water, he loves my cooking, and I love to cook, he takes care of the laundry which I absolutely hate. We have pretty much a fair division of chores in the house. We are always helping each other in that sense, like we really do everything in the house evenly and together.", "Sorry but he is not funding my daughter\u2019s life. I take care of her, he loves her, comes to her games and stuff but I solely take care of my daughter. The more I read the replies and comments, the more I\u2019m just opening my eyes. Sadly :(", "He said the appraisal was for free from his bank so we can know how much equity we have in assets. I though this was normal every few years.", "I'm sorry, I don't want to upset you. It's just that on threads where the husband has begun pushing for things they weren't interested in before, it is rarely positive. And that's across all forums, not just reddit.\n\nI hope I am wrong and he is one of the ones that is just being clumsy about wanting to make a home together. Either way I would keep him off the mortgage.\n\nPlus in a cost of living crisis, why take on extra debt you don't absolutely need to.", "I fear the moment his name is on the deed that you will be screwed one way or another. Alarm bells say he\u2019s either cheating or he\u2019s got an addiction. Maybe secretly funnelling money to family? \n\nEither way, something\u2019s rotten in the state of Denmark. \nNTA.", "It is very weird. He sounds like a very normal guy who just so happens to want to rip off his wife. Do you understand what's going on here cuz there's a giant murky mystery to me.", "If you're the main/sole cook and you're happy with the kitchen, what would you redo it to his preference? You're the one that will be using it! That makes absolutely no sense and is actually very selfish of him.", "What does this have to do with funding your daughter.  First, her goal should be to fund herself.  Second, asking someone to have no say over the place they live in is a big ask.\n\nI\u2019m not saying put him on the title.  I\u2019m saying to have a discussion, maybe he\u2019d be open to putting in $500k to get on the title, maybe he\u2019s find with it as long as he understands that he\u2019ll never be able to make changes in the house.  He could be 100% fine with that.\n\nRight now it seems like you are planning your future and your daughter\u2019s future and that\u2019s it.  Do you have a plan with him in the future?  Does he have a say in any of it or is he just along for the ride and he\u2019s welcome to leave if he doesn\u2019t like it?  Have you discussed downsizing at some point with him?  Where does he see himself living in 30 years?  What if you retire first or your daughter wants a house in 10 years?  Are you going to sell the house with discussing it with him?  Is he fine with this or would he be upset to have to move? \n\nI\u2019m trying to understand the context here.", "You need to protect yourself at all costs. It's not normal to get an appraisal unless you have a mortgage or buying or selling a home. \n\nIt honestly sounds to me like he suspected the home was worth something and is trying to get the name on the deed to get half of it's worth. I wonder if he plans to leave shortly after. \n\nNo renovations and look for anything suspicious", "As a renter, I\u2019ve been in my current house for 6 years. It got appraised for the first time since I moved in, in January for insurance purposes.\n\nThe bank or real estate shouldn\u2019t even be looking at it without your say so. \n\nLook, laws are different everywhere, but I\u2019ve never heard of free appraisals. You might want to talk to his bank and find out the deal.", "No, it's not very common.\n\n\nAnd I think you summed it up right there...  \"how much equity **we** have\".\n\n\n\nHe could have figured that answer out without paying an appraiser -- he has ZERO equity in YOUR house!  \n\n\nThere is absolutely no reason for him to have been looking into this, except that he thinks he's entitled to your house.  (Don't let him take it!!)\n\n\n\nEdit to add: definitely NTA", "You are speaking nonsense. She is taking care of her daughter and giving her a good start in life. Are you actually suggesting that the right thing to do here is to give her new husband half of her property because that might make him happy?", "Where did I say to just give it to him?  I clearly stated he should have to pay.  \n\nAnd no, I don\u2019t consider selling a house to give money to a kid taking care of them.  That\u2019s a great gift, but that goes above \u201ctaking care\u201d of a child.  At this point, OP have no idea what her future is even going to be.  She might not have the money to just sell her house and give the profit to her daughter.  The daughter might end up becoming wealthy on her own and not need the money.\n\nRight now, you have a person married, not expecting to move in 30 years, telling her partner that he can never have a say in the place they are currently calling home.  I can understand how that might make a person uncomfortable.  \n\nShe has also done a disservice to herself because her husband can live rent free, invest in his own place, and make an excellent profit himself while she foots his living bill.  Remember, he\u2019s making much more than her.  \n\nThis whole setup is pretty much designed to make it an all out for oneself situation which, IMHO, is not the best way to have a relationship.  It sounds like they should save up for a new place to buy together.  She could the sell the house and put the profits into a fund for 30 years.  That way she and her husband have a home with equal shares, she gets to keep the money from her original house without the husband involved, and in 30 years she\u2019ll have a huge account that she can give to her kid or not."]}
