There is no need for him to own part of your home. \n\nIf you NEEDED renovations, you could get a loan in your name only using the house as collateral. So this idea that the only way is to take out a mortgage in his name, thereby being forced to put his name on the deed, is a bit suspect. Especially it sounds like these are not even necessary renovations. \n\nYou don't give any details about how paying off his debts led to him have nothing left from the sale of his condo, but that jumped out at me. It could be totally normal if he didn't live there long and paid off student loans. But if he has a history of accumulating debt, I would extra careful of giving him legal rights to your house or taking on any kind of joint debt.\n\nMake sure you are checking your credit score regularly. I hate to be suspicious, but your house is a significant asset and you have a child to think of.", "NTA he sold his property, and paid off his debts?

He can go out and buy any *other*  real estate his little heart desires. \n\nIf your husband wants to renovate the house he lives in, well, he can take out a different kind of loan or pay for with it with his bigger salary. Or he can suck it up and live in a perfectly nice house. \n\nNTA I think your concerns are valid. Better safe than sorry, ya know?", "NTA.  This is a backhanded way of getting himself added to the deed.  Don't do it.  Once he's on that deed that's it - he owns half your house.  He knew when you married the house was yours and he had no problem with it.  He can't circle back now and demand your property.  Hard no.", "Nta - if the renovations are so important to him then he can pay for them out of pocket. Getting a mortgage on a house that is already paid off for a matter like this is ridiculous. Do not let him pressure you into this, it is not financially sound nor is it in your best interest.\n\nEdited for typo", "NTA. Don't budge on this. He makes double what you make and had a condo to sell and still only broke even after paying off debt?

One who YOU hire, YOU pay for (not him!) and YOU get advice from! \n\nIt is **probably not true** that you \"need to give him half the house to get a mortgage.\" At least it isn't in Massachusetts, which is where I live. I do a lot in real estate and my family writes mortgages for a living.  It may be perfectly possible for him to be a \"co-borrower\" and not a \"co-owner.\"", "This is super sus. He signed a prenup acknowledging he is to have no claim on the house and now because the house is now worth nearly 1 mill he wants to \"renovate\" and get a mortgage and having an issue with his name not on the house.

Watch out for yourself and your daughter's future. NTA", "NTA, no, No, NO! do not let his name go on the house. If he wants to renovate so bad let him take out a loan on his own.

I bet as soon as you got the mortgage he would divorce you and make you sell and give him half.", "NTA but I do you have two questions. The first is if you want to do renovations or if this is just for him. The second is why doing renovations would require you to put him on the mortgage. Normally you could just get a line of credit or home equity loan, but really not a big deal.\n\nOne other thing, no matter what you decide to do you should wait, because right now interest rates are very high.", "NTA don't do this, this gives him right to your house but still means you have no right to any future property he gets, your parent wouldn't want you to do this", "NTA - you considered the idea and decided against it. Unless he can sign something that makes it so he can't claim it in the event of a divorce or puts your name on his assets in the equivalent of what the house is worth, don't do it. Your gut says no, listen to it.", "NTA. It's strange that all the sudden he is pushing for this.  See if you can get the mortgage in just your name. If you can't, then save money and update the house one room at a time.  If you even want to do that anyway.", "Nta, don't do it, cover your own ass", "NTA. houses serve a purpose - protect you from the elements and provide a hub for you to live your life. Taking an unnecessary mortgage means you have to work for the house now. You should only have a mortgage to buy the house.

You need to check and confirm that his name HAS to be added to obtain a mortgage, I don't think you do and if so, he's scamming you to get on the title.

Your statement that he automatically gets half is not correct and depends on where you are. In the US, it's possible to own a smaller part of a property. Let's say your home is worth 850k and he's willing to put 150k into renovations. An attorney could assist with ensuring he only owned 15% of the property. \n\nThe reason why I would caution again adding him at all is the complexity of untangling that ownership if you did split up. You could have a post-nup (yes, it's a thing) that says you have the right to buy out his 15% or whatever if you choose and how that value would be determined.\n\nUltimately, there are ways but legal paperwork is never fun and you shouldn't feel forced into it.", "NTA. Not unless he hands you $500k first.

Go to the bank and find out what you alone are eligible for, and determine whether you can afford to make the payments. You could also talk to a lawyer about him buying in to ownership of the house. If he wants to pay you half of the current market value, you could come up with a contract that allows him to make payments directly to you.

Speak to a lawyer. Perhaps you can draw up an agreement and have on the title that x% is your sole separate property and y% is joint property. In the agreeement you should write that you make all decisions of any sale.\n\nBy renovations, do you mean repairs, or making changes to the basic house such as adding rooms? If it is just renovations, pay for it out of income, do not take a mortgage.", "NTA and nope nope nope. This is a *no so subtle* way to co-own your property with all that it implies.

I mean, he\u2019s your husband not your tenet. \n\nI don\u2019t think it was a wise move to put a clause in the prenup that allows him to buy a property after the marriage and only have it in his name.

Assuming your husband isn't a comic book villain (never certain), it sounds like your goals are to protect yourself in the case of a divorce and to provide an inheritance to your daughter. Both of those can be accomplished while also taking out a joint loan for renovation, if that's something you and your husband want to do- but I think that's the crux of the issue. You say that you're both happy with a house that hasn't been updated since 1995; is that really true for him as well? If he makes enough money for renovations and wants them, I don't know that it's unreasonable for him to have a say in his living space, and that's possible to arrange fairly without you giving up your equity. It also sounds like he's unhappy living in a house he has no rights to; perhaps he feels dependent on you (what happens to him in a divorce?), or like he can't customize his living space. There are emotional issues with prenups that aren't necessarily rational; he might not feel like you trust him. I would also be curious to what level your finances are otherwise joint and whether he is interested in adopting your daughter. Ultimately, it's your house and you should definitely not compromise that- but as his wife, you should also be mindful of his feelings and try to find a solution. \n\nTL;DR: On a practical level, all of this can be fixed.

He has made his intentions clear. He is trying to bypass the prenup.\n\nLook at what he said. First, he wanted to do renovations. OK. That's not unusual. Then he has to go on the deed for these. That could be understandable, investing in a property and gaining some ownership is not unheard of. Then, when you push back, he let his real reason out, he calls you and A. H. for not wanting him to also own the house. So everything was to get his name on the deed. \n\nI would begin to worry about about marital debt if you are not tracking it now. There's two scenarios that could be playing out:\n\n1. He's feeling like he is a guest in the home you live in.\n2. He's planning something and it involves a half million from your house.\n\nI'm leaning towards 2 because of the underhand way he tried to maneuver around the prenup. You signed a prenup for a reason.

Really bad. Like he is looking into options to walk away with half a million. There are too many \u201ccoincidences\u201d in this. \n\nI suggest you to do two things: \n\nA) talk to your lawyer ALONE. Make sure the prenup is airtight and if there are any loopholes that could get him in. Also think about his contributions, eg I think if he were to contribute to some renovations I think I\u2019d be fair for him to get some equity although not automatically half. Look into the legal consequences of each action. He clearly already did so you should as well. Also in case he intentions are malicious and the renovations angle fails he might come up with a new and less obvious scheme. \n\nB) Talk to him and see if it is malicious or in good faith. Tell him you don\u2019t feel comfortable remortgaging the house as you don\u2019t want debts but that you\u2019ll save up money to renovate necessary bits piece by piece or maybe you\u2019ll take small loans, easy to pay off and one by one, because you want him to be happy in the house. Basically say that he gets everything he wants but the deed just a bit slower. If he is arguing in good faith he will love this suggestion. If he doesn\u2019t, listen carefully to his reasons. *Edit: of course talk to the lawyer first then to him. Know your rights, then you can still check his intentions from a legally safe pov!

I sure as hell couldn't do what you do, and I respect that.", "Well hopefully this post has taught you enough empathy of what the others side is like that you won't allow him to scam his future ex. It sounds like you have the power to prevent him from ruining someone's life and you're not using it because it wouldn't be convenient for you.", "That doesn\u2019t sound right. Banks don\u2019t hand out appraisals out like Halloween candy. The only time an appraisal is needed (to my knowledge) is when the owner is planning on selling or they\u2019re applying for a loan with their home as collateral.\n\nETA: he said how much equity \u201cwe\u201d have. Um no, its your equity and yours only.", ">He said the appraisal was for free from his bank so we can know how much equity we have in assets. I though this was normal every few years.\n\nSis, there is a very very good chance he has already started the mortgage process and forged your name on some documents. Please reach out to the appraisal company and ask for a copy of the contract.", "It would feel like a red flag to me too,", "Right. That's just a lie he hoped she wouldn't check out.", "Worst case scenario he'll scam OP and then divorce her to get the rest of what she owns. I'd definitely advice her go get some legal advice to make sure everything will stay hers and/or her daughters', and ask about the suggestions made in this thread. Of course, best case scenario is husband loves OP and wants to ensure the house will keep it's worth, but I sincerely doubt this is the case- and even then, a mortgage wouldn't be the first thing I'd think of. Husband sounds just plain greedy to me.", "I know Robert who had his thing sold. He wasn't happy with that", "It doesn't sound like he's paying to live in the mortgage-free house yet he thinks he deserves half of it because he's married to her. Tell him he can pay rent equivalent to his share of the mortgage with his big salary and you will save it for renovations. You don't need anything done immediately but he's pushing it for some reason. Why pay interest on a mortgage? \n\nIt's a big red flag that he suddenly wants to saddle you with debt and lose half of your interest in the house. Could he be cheating? If you split up, he could force the sale of the house. I would be 100% your money on the line and he suddenly wants in on it. NTA", ">He can go out and buy any other real estate his little heart desires.\n\nBut then he wouldn't have $500k that he's paid nothing towards ;)", "Exactly.  Guy thought he had it made with the ability to own his own real estate and now is like \"Fuck!  I could just get myself on this house for like 1/10 the cost of anything I can buy right now.\"", "I freakin *DIED* at Captain Scampants!!!!! And NTA Op, DON\u2019T DO THIS!", "The divorce seems inevitable.", "That's what I was thinking but then it jumped straight to him getting put on the deed! I'm pretty sure that would automatically make it marital property.", "Op I cannot stress this enough. \n\nMove your important documents to a safety deposit box in the bank. Make sure he does not have a copy of them.the deed to the house, your birth certificate, your daughters birth certificate, the title of the house etc etc. Freeze your credit of you and your daughter. \nIf you're in the UK, allow the land registry to contact you if there's any attempts made to change the registry of your property. \n\nGo and see an estate planning lawyer AND a divorce lawyer. You don't have to be planning to leave him to do this, you can be going to one to protect yourself and do some planning incase he strikes you out of the blue. \n\nHe is acting strangely and he is likely planning to leave you and he is likely acting on the advice of a divorce lawyer already so you need to suit up NOW.\n\nIdeally go and see several divorce lawyers to prevent him from getting one near you on the off chance he has not due to attorney client privilege.  \n\nUnder no circumstances allow him on the deed\n\nI am so sorry this is happening to you. \n\nAFTER you have protected yourself and lawyered up, go to couples counselling to work out what's going on and if your marriage is worth saving. Do this AFTER you've protected yourself and go in with the exclusive mindset that HE CANNOT HAVE ANY PEICE OF THE HOUSE. Make this a non negotiable with your therapist.", "Girl HE SAID he would fight you for half of the house even with the prenup, why would you make things easier for him? There is something going on and you know it. I mean who evaluates their house \"for fun\". You can talk to him but don't do anything to the house. You don't want to and that's a reason enough.", "Wait wait wait so he wants your house but he doesn't want to even dip a toe into shared anything with a joint account? Run for the hills. He's not being trustworthy.", "Yep, don\u2019t let him pay for ANYTHING.", "Sure, pay for a lie detector.  Or just ask a question and flip a coin.  It\u2019s literally the same difference.", "Just remember, any renovations you do with him putting money toward it will likely have to be paid back with interest or according to how your property continues to go up in value, at minimum, in the case of a divorce.  It can be much worse than this depending on the laws in your state and the language (or lack of language) in the prenup.  Does the prenup address how you guys are to handle the increased property value while you\u2019re married?  What about him investing in it through renovations or repairs?  I have a feeling it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019d double check that and get legal advice on how to handle those situations BEFORE accepting a dime from him for anything to do with improving the house.", "Yep, adding a name can mean reappraisal and new property tax rate.  Sometimes it\u2019s worth it, depending on what\u2019s going on with the involved parties.  This is not that kind of case though.  Keep him OFF.", "Raise is hugely important. For you and any childrenn.", "It\u2019s usually family- my husband and his siblings\u2019 credit scores were trashed by the time they turned 18 because of their dad", "Definitely need to triple check before posting.  Not sure how my phone came up with \u2018Robert thing\u2019 to replace the word \u2018everything\u2019.\nScary way to become a eunuch though...\nlmjao"]}
