There is no need for him to own part of your home. \n\nIf you NEEDED renovations, you could get a loan in your name only using the house as collateral. So this idea that the only way is to take out a mortgage in his name, thereby being forced to put his name on the deed, is a bit suspect. Especially it sounds like these are not even necessary renovations. \n\nYou don't give any details about how paying off his debts led to him have nothing left from the sale of his condo, but that jumped out at me. It could be totally normal if he didn't live there long and paid off student loans. But if he has a history of accumulating debt, I would extra careful of giving him legal rights to your house or taking on any kind of joint debt.\n\nMake sure you are checking your credit score regularly. I hate to be suspicious, but your house is a significant asset and you have a child to think of.", "NTA he sold his property, and paid off his debts?

He can go out and buy any *other*  real estate his little heart desires. \n\nIf your husband wants to renovate the house he lives in, well, he can take out a different kind of loan or pay for with it with his bigger salary. Or he can suck it up and live in a perfectly nice house. \n\nNTA I think your concerns are valid. Better safe than sorry, ya know?", "NTA.  This is a backhanded way of getting himself added to the deed.  Don't do it.  Once he's on that deed that's it - he owns half your house.  He knew when you married the house was yours and he had no problem with it.  He can't circle back now and demand your property.  Hard no.", "Nta - if the renovations are so important to him then he can pay for them out of pocket. Getting a mortgage on a house that is already paid off for a matter like this is ridiculous. Do not let him pressure you into this, it is not financially sound nor is it in your best interest.\n\nEdited for typo", "NTA. Don't budge on this. He makes double what you make and had a condo to sell and still only broke even after paying off debt?

One who YOU hire, YOU pay for (not him!) and YOU get advice from! \n\nIt is **probably not true** that you \"need to give him half the house to get a mortgage.\" At least it isn't in Massachusetts, which is where I live. I do a lot in real estate and my family writes mortgages for a living.  It may be perfectly possible for him to be a \"co-borrower\" and not a \"co-owner.\"", "This is super sus. He signed a prenup acknowledging he is to have no claim on the house and now because the house is now worth nearly 1 mill he wants to \"renovate\" and get a mortgage and having an issue with his name not on the house.

Watch out for yourself and your daughter's future. NTA", "NTA, no, No, NO! do not let his name go on the house. If he wants to renovate so bad let him take out a loan on his own.

I bet as soon as you got the mortgage he would divorce you and make you sell and give him half.", "NTA but I do you have two questions. The first is if you want to do renovations or if this is just for him. The second is why doing renovations would require you to put him on the mortgage. Normally you could just get a line of credit or home equity loan, but really not a big deal.\n\nOne other thing, no matter what you decide to do you should wait, because right now interest rates are very high.", "NTA don't do this, this gives him right to your house but still means you have no right to any future property he gets, your parent wouldn't want you to do this", "NTA - you considered the idea and decided against it. Unless he can sign something that makes it so he can't claim it in the event of a divorce or puts your name on his assets in the equivalent of what the house is worth, don't do it. Your gut says no, listen to it.", "NTA. It's strange that all the sudden he is pushing for this.  See if you can get the mortgage in just your name. If you can't, then save money and update the house one room at a time.  If you even want to do that anyway.", "Nta, don't do it, cover your own ass", "NTA. houses serve a purpose - protect you from the elements and provide a hub for you to live your life. Taking an unnecessary mortgage means you have to work for the house now. You should only have a mortgage to buy the house.

You need to check and confirm that his name HAS to be added to obtain a mortgage, I don't think you do and if so, he's scamming you to get on the title.

Your statement that he automatically gets half is not correct and depends on where you are. In the US, it's possible to own a smaller part of a property. Let's say your home is worth 850k and he's willing to put 150k into renovations. An attorney could assist with ensuring he only owned 15% of the property. \n\nThe reason why I would caution again adding him at all is the complexity of untangling that ownership if you did split up. You could have a post-nup (yes, it's a thing) that says you have the right to buy out his 15% or whatever if you choose and how that value would be determined.\n\nUltimately, there are ways but legal paperwork is never fun and you shouldn't feel forced into it.", "NTA. Not unless he hands you $500k first.

Go to the bank and find out what you alone are eligible for, and determine whether you can afford to make the payments. You could also talk to a lawyer about him buying in to ownership of the house. If he wants to pay you half of the current market value, you could come up with a contract that allows him to make payments directly to you.

Speak to a lawyer. Perhaps you can draw up an agreement and have on the title that x% is your sole separate property and y% is joint property. In the agreeement you should write that you make all decisions of any sale.\n\nBy renovations, do you mean repairs, or making changes to the basic house such as adding rooms? If it is just renovations, pay for it out of income, do not take a mortgage.", "NTA and nope nope nope. This is a *no so subtle* way to co-own your property with all that it implies.

I mean, he\u2019s your husband not your tenet. \n\nI don\u2019t think it was a wise move to put a clause in the prenup that allows him to buy a property after the marriage and only have it in his name.

Assuming your husband isn't a comic book villain (never certain), it sounds like your goals are to protect yourself in the case of a divorce and to provide an inheritance to your daughter. Both of those can be accomplished while also taking out a joint loan for renovation, if that's something you and your husband want to do- but I think that's the crux of the issue. You say that you're both happy with a house that hasn't been updated since 1995; is that really true for him as well? If he makes enough money for renovations and wants them, I don't know that it's unreasonable for him to have a say in his living space, and that's possible to arrange fairly without you giving up your equity. It also sounds like he's unhappy living in a house he has no rights to; perhaps he feels dependent on you (what happens to him in a divorce?), or like he can't customize his living space. There are emotional issues with prenups that aren't necessarily rational; he might not feel like you trust him. I would also be curious to what level your finances are otherwise joint and whether he is interested in adopting your daughter. Ultimately, it's your house and you should definitely not compromise that- but as his wife, you should also be mindful of his feelings and try to find a solution. \n\nTL;DR: On a practical level, all of this can be fixed.

He has made his intentions clear. He is trying to bypass the prenup.\n\nLook at what he said. First, he wanted to do renovations. OK. That's not unusual. Then he has to go on the deed for these. That could be understandable, investing in a property and gaining some ownership is not unheard of. Then, when you push back, he let his real reason out, he calls you and A. H. for not wanting him to also own the house. So everything was to get his name on the deed. \n\nI would begin to worry about about marital debt if you are not tracking it now. There's two scenarios that could be playing out:\n\n1. He's feeling like he is a guest in the home you live in.\n2. He's planning something and it involves a half million from your house.\n\nI'm leaning towards 2 because of the underhand way he tried to maneuver around the prenup. You signed a prenup for a reason.

Really bad. Like he is looking into options to walk away with half a million. There are too many \u201ccoincidences\u201d in this. \n\nI suggest you to do two things: \n\nA) talk to your lawyer ALONE. Make sure the prenup is airtight and if there are any loopholes that could get him in. Also think about his contributions, eg I think if he were to contribute to some renovations I think I\u2019d be fair for him to get some equity although not automatically half. Look into the legal consequences of each action. He clearly already did so you should as well. Also in case he intentions are malicious and the renovations angle fails he might come up with a new and less obvious scheme. \n\nB) Talk to him and see if it is malicious or in good faith. Tell him you don\u2019t feel comfortable remortgaging the house as you don\u2019t want debts but that you\u2019ll save up money to renovate necessary bits piece by piece or maybe you\u2019ll take small loans, easy to pay off and one by one, because you want him to be happy in the house. Basically say that he gets everything he wants but the deed just a bit slower. If he is arguing in good faith he will love this suggestion.

And take his greedy paws off OP's and her daughter's house + inheritance.", "Wouldn\u2019t he even then just have to be a guarantor on the loan and not necessarily on the deed?", "And considering he makes two times what she does, that's possible.", "Mine as well but it's fairly trivial to deal with some sort of equitable lien v. full-blown name on the title.", "You're absolutely correct, thanks", "Why are you still wanting to talk to him about this? \n\nHe had enough debt, despite making significantly more than you, that he had 0$ left over after selling a condo. \n\nHe has already said that he plans on fighting you for the gains on your property. Is he planning on divorcing you or does he just want you to flat out give him money? If the former, then he's planning on leaving you and you know it. \n\nHe had YOUR house appraised \"for fun\", and is now wanting to be on the paperwork after learning what it is worth. \n\nGirl fuckin run. Protect yourself, your daughter, and your house. \n\nHe makes so much more than you, so where is it? Where's it going?", "That\u2019s not normal.  I\u2019ve owned a house for almost 19 years.  The only time I had a appraisal was before a sale or purchase.  Never for fun.  Also, be very very sure he does not have other debts. They can be very easily hidden.", "Here\u2019s the thing. Getting an appraisal plus pushing hard for unnecessary renovations for the sole purpose of \u201cupdating\u201d screams to me someone getting ready to put a house on the market. You mentioned that he doesn\u2019t use the kitchen so it\u2019s not a convenience issue, he just wants to update. That coupled with trying to get his name on the deed/mortgage and his comments to your family about how he would fight the prenup tells me that he is possibly actively planning for a divorce (actively as in he\u2019s made the decision and is taking steps,  not thinking in a \u201cjust in case\u201d kind of way) and is trying to set things up so he gets as much as possible (half the cost of the house that will sell better when updated). \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just a cynic but I can\u2019t honestly see any positive reason for all of his behaviours mentioned above. \n\nGet a lawyer, make sure your prenup is safe, do not remortgage or renovate and don\u2019t let him put any money into the house. Put your foot down and see how he reacts. You may not want a divorce but that doesn\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t and won\u2019t be insanely nasty about it (and his comment about fighting the prenup proves that he would be nasty about it). Protect yourself.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t want a divorce and let\u2019s it go once you tell him the reno definitely isn\u2019t happening, then no harm no foul. But if he does want a divorce and you don\u2019t take steps to protect yourself then you are in for a world of hurt. Bad enough to have to mourn the end of a marriage. Worse to mourn while also having to watch your partner steal half of your net worth.", "My mother was a manager in an appraisal office (most banks don't keep that infrastructure, so it's most likely a 3rd party), and my father was a loan officer. It's absolutely not normal for a \"free\" periodic appraisal, unless someone really owed him a favor, or he already looked into starting paperwork for a loan. \n\nI know y'all get on great, and that he seems to be a great partner, but this, combined with him declaring he's going to fight the prenup, is more red flags than a communist parade. \n\nHe does not have your best interests at heart, even if he isn't actively trying to hurt you.", "No - major red flag. I would check to ensure he has 0 claim to your house.  Is he in some financial trouble that he wants to get his hands on your house?", "Exactly. There is zero reason that he would need to be on the deed", "Even as a guarantor, if he goes on to make any payments, it gives him ground to challenge the prenup as he's now put money into the house. \n\nEven without him directly putting any money in, he can claim that the improvements were jointly funded and so he now has a claim on the house. At the very least, it complicates things.\n\nOP, if you do decide to renovate, make sure it's done from YOUR money, and get a lawyer to draft an agreement ensuring that he still has no interest in the property. Once you make improvements, it's no longer the same house he signed a prenup against.", "Depends on loan type.  I've been out of the business a few years, but when I last worked with them, it was that certain ones wouldn't allow a cosigner without occupancy/deed rights.", "In a life where each member is coming in with separate assets and responsibilities, pre-nups are important in order to retain inheritance and property rights. Her husband has no interest in giving her $500k. He seems to be interested in being put on the mortgage which effectively makes a separate asset into a co-mingled asset which is very messy in a divorce.\n\nI don't know why you think he is paying nothing towards rent or whatever, but if so, that is yet another issue.\n\nI think selling the house and then purchasing a new one together could work but OP seems to really love this house. If he is amenable to that idea then I would be more confident that he is not just trying to scam her."]}
