Thank you for your kind words. About a day after I got home, Carol sent me a text saying she apologizes for how she acted. She told me in the text how she's been feeling bad about the situation since I left, she acted out-of-bounds, was stressed but shouldn't have taken it out on me, and sorry she exaggerated the story to our family members. She finally asked if I would come back up north to come chat with her about it, along with the rest of the family. I declined because I had work and couldn't make the round trip, so we talked on the phone. She kept profusely apologizing for how she acted, and was trying to make amends. I was honestly shocked, but grateful. We made arrangements for a few months from now to meet up in person.\n\nOn the more negative side, I haven't heard from the rest of the family as I'm writing this. I'm not sure if they're still mad, just ignoring me, or some other reason. I think it might be the latter as I asked Carol about it and she's not even sure. Whatever it is, I hope they talk to me soon.\n\n Again, thank you!", "created_utc": 1680804436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dslqi/update_aita_for_not_taking_care_of_my_cousins/", "score": 302, "replies": [">and sorry she exaggerated the story to our family members\n\nDid she tell them she exaggerated the story? Otherwise her apology is worth absolutely nothing! She'll still be the victim from their point of view, and you can't hold a grudge without looking like an a-hole, because she apologised.", "I don't understand the need to drive 3 hours for them to apologize, facetime works just as well. I'm so tired of the moms who use the \"I need a break from my kids\" as an excuse for some one else to watch them. These are usually the kids who aren't parented well and aren't used to a routine. There's no reason to subject someone else to another parents failings. It's a big red flag and big fat No for me.", "Seconding that not telling everyone that she lied and slandered you to the entire family is not an apology or atonement for her actions. She needs to come clean and regardless I would never do her any favors.", "Sounds like they might still be angry because they haven\u2019t heard the full story from Carol yet.", "Yes, she knew she was wrong because she had to exaggerate the situation to make her look like the victim. I agree that it's doubtful she explained this part to the rest of the family. Even if she did they should be mature enough to to apologize for being an A H' to op. They have no reason to be petty and still not speak with her. I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. You did nothing wrong.\nETA: correct spelling.", "This right here.  If Carol is truly sorry, she can clean up the mess she made", "They are not obligated to talk to you ever again", "One thought I had while reading your original post and this update is that it's upsetting that your family didn't or wouldn't give you the space to explain your side of the situation before making a judgement call or choosing sides. And since those same family members are continuing to act distant and cold, OP might need to address a systemic issue that goes beyond just this one incident. I don't know, just thinking out-loud.\n\nObviously OP needs to do what's best for themselves, so now might not be the best time to address any overarching family dynamics and just stick the issue at hand.", "She wanted you to drive 3 hours back so she could again play the victim. 'See I'm apologizing even though she was the wrong one' That was going to be the jest of that conversation. The entire family is still under the impression that you were mean to her and her child. Tell HER TO FIX IT or no contact.", "Sorry, but I think what she did before was unforgivable and no amount of apology will change that.\n\nNo matter what stress a mother may be under, she can't insist on childcare from someone who isn't willing. You didn't have this child. She did.\n\nAnd the child, from your report, is a horror.\n\nAlso, it's not clear how she explained the event and her alleged repentance to your relatives. I don't believe you need their \"forgiveness,\" because they shouldn't have opened their traps about it in the first place. Why didn't they take little Trudy (or whoever she is)?\n\nHow you deal with this is of course up to you. But I personally would not want any of these people in my life, including little Trudy.", "Well hey man, unlike the rest of these crusties in the comments, I'm happy you got what seems like  genuine apology.", "If they're anything like my family they'll just pretend nothing happened. No acknowledgement means no apologies.", ">I asked Carol about it and she's not even sure\n\nMaybe double check she's told them she exaggerated events", "Carol needs to clear this up with the rest of the family.  She was also wrong for doing that, and needs to fix it.", "If Carol is genuinely sorry, maybe she should talk to all the family members who are still mad at you. She should admit to them that she exaggerated the story.\n\nAnd you were definitely NOT the asshole. Her children, her responsibility. If she needs a break, she can find a consenting babysitter or pay someone to do it."]}
