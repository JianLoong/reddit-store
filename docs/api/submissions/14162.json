Thank you for your kind words. About a day after I got home, Carol sent me a text saying she apologizes for how she acted. She told me in the text how she's been feeling bad about the situation since I left, she acted out-of-bounds, was stressed but shouldn't have taken it out on me, and sorry she exaggerated the story to our family members. She finally asked if I would come back up north to come chat with her about it, along with the rest of the family. I declined because I had work and couldn't make the round trip, so we talked on the phone. She kept profusely apologizing for how she acted, and was trying to make amends. I was honestly shocked, but grateful. We made arrangements for a few months from now to meet up in person.\n\nOn the more negative side, I haven't heard from the rest of the family as I'm writing this. I'm not sure if they're still mad, just ignoring me, or some other reason. I think it might be the latter as I asked Carol about it and she's not even sure. Whatever it is, I hope they talk to me soon.\n\n Again, thank you!", "created_utc": 1680804436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dslqi/update_aita_for_not_taking_care_of_my_cousins/", "score": 50, "replies": [">and sorry she exaggerated the story to our family members\n\nDid she tell them she exaggerated the story? Otherwise her apology is worth absolutely nothing! She'll still be the victim from their point of view, and you can't hold a grudge without looking like an a-hole, because she apologised.", "I don't understand the need to drive 3 hours for them to apologize, facetime works just as well. I'm so tired of the moms who use the \"I need a break from my kids\" as an excuse for some one else to watch them. These are usually the kids who aren't parented well and aren't used to a routine. There's no reason to subject someone else to another parents failings. It's a big red flag and big fat No for me.", "Seconding that not telling everyone that she lied and slandered you to the entire family is not an apology or atonement for her actions. She needs to come clean and regardless I would never do her any favors.", "Sounds like they might still be angry because they haven\u2019t heard the full story from Carol yet.", "Yes, she knew she was wrong because she had to exaggerate the situation to make her look like the victim. I agree that it's doubtful she explained this part to the rest of the family. Even if she did they should be mature enough to to apologize for being an A H' to op. They have no reason to be petty and still not speak with her. I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. You did nothing wrong.\nETA: correct spelling.", "This right here.  If Carol is truly sorry, she can clean up the mess she made"]}
