This is one of the main (although small) reasons that I\u2019m considering not renewing our lease. One of many, at least.\n\nThroughout the week, not even every day, I ask my roommate, Jessica, to do something small for me. It's nothing big or significant, it's always small things. Some examples are:\n\n* \"Can you grab my bag off the table for me?\"\n* \"Can you load the dishwasher?\"\n* \"Can you turn off the outside light?\"\n* \"Can you grab me a fork?\" \n* \"Oh can you grab me a cup also?\"\n\nAnd I\u2019m *always* told, \"Only if you say please.\"  I listened to it for a few months before I finally spoke up and told her that I didn't feel like I needed to say please for every single thing because I felt like it was implied and the things that I was asking her to do were always small things that I don\u2019t think are significant or necessarily warrant me saying \"please\". \n\nHer response was that \"please\" cannot be implied (I disagree because of the tone of voice) and that I need to say it every single time. I finally told her that if what I was asking her to do as a favor was so out of line for me to ask that I needed to say please and she wouldn't do it under any other circumstances, I'd literally just do it myself. I'll ask for small things that I could just do myself, but she may be closer or already doing something similar or it may be that I\u2019m asking her to do something because it's her mess - but she still demands say please. I've tried to tell her that if these things are really so crazy for me to ask that she refuses to do them without a formal \"please\" then it seems like she views our friendship too conditionally. \n\nI don\u2019t need people to say please, I'll do things for them without them asking or without them saying please because I care about them and want to help them. I'll do things for her without saying please, but she doesn't view it the same. The constant \"say please\" seems like something a parent would do to teach their child manners. I\u2019m a whole-ass adult, I don\u2019t need to be taught manners. I\u2019m a very polite person, I\u2019m kind, and I say \"please\" and \"thank you\" in situations where it makes sense to say it (at work, when engaging in more formal conversation or with elders, or when talking to kids, etc.) but typically not when I\u2019m having a casual conversation with a friend.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to say \"please\" every damn time?", "created_utc": 1682380038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12y10yd/aita_for_refusing_to_say_please_every_time_i_ask/", "score": 978, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s basic courtesy to say please and thank you. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a favour or a request or anything else. If you ask someone to do something then you say please.

Look I actually understand a lot of what you\u2019re saying, I have many close friendships where I could say \u201chey throw me that bag over there\u201d and neither of us would think anything of it. Other friends, that wouldn\u2019t really work with. For you, this isn\u2019t a big deal and you don\u2019t get why you should have to do it; from her perspective, it\u2019s about consideration for one another and it\u2019s obviously important to her. It makes her feel bad for you not to say please, so the kind and right thing to do is to say please when you ask for something because: 1) she\u2019s asked on many occasions, 2) it makes her feel good, 3) to not say it would make her feel bad. It\u2019s not about the word, it\u2019s about the relationship, and you\u2019re making a choice to repeatedly do something that she\u2019s told you bothers her. That\u2019s not a very nice way to treat a friendship. All you have to do to make your friend feel appreciated is say one extra word.

But whenever I asked a question like this to this roomate, her response would ALWAYS be \"I don't know, CAN YOU?!\" Because apparently this is what her family did to her because the \"right\" word to use is \"may\", not \"can\" -- and it's similar to what you described - it was like she was treating me like a child who needed to be \"trained\" to use the \"right\" word. I 100% get how it feels patronizing to have your words policed like that, especially when you come from a background where the social rules of phrasing/word use are different.\n\nThat being said, most people will use 'please' barring certain exceptional circumstances.

My personal opinion is that one should always say please, even for a simple \u201cgiven\u201d kind of \u201chey can you pass the fork right there\u201d task. To me, it sounds weird without putting a \u201cplease\u201d at the end.

But the person you\u2019re asking to do these tasks clearly finds the way you\u2019re asking her to be rude, so doesn\u2019t it make sense to adjust to her communication style here?

Instead of digging your heels and insisting you\u2019re being polite (when really I think most people think you aren\u2019t, but again I can understand your reasoning even if I don\u2019t agree with it), just adjust and communicate with her in a way that makes her feel respected. I think you\u2019re making it about you and you\u2019re feelings when it shouldn\u2019t be.
