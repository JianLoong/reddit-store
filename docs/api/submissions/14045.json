If she\u2019s working with an organization, you should let them know the kinds of things she\u2019s saying to other volunteers - it\u2019s likely you\u2019re not the only person she has offended and driven off.  Losing volunteers because of a bad volunteer can really hurt an organization.  When I\u2019ve volunteered interned with, and worked at nonprofits, they all wanted to hear about things like this, because keeping volunteer moral and commitment high is a really important (and often challenging) part of managing a volunteer-based project.", "NTA! You have no obligation to work with this person", "NTA 100%\n\nYou don't refuse to do charity, you refuse to work with that person. You have other optons.", "NTA. You have the right to not want to do charity work with any person that you don't want. Especially someone who thinks that people on food stamps need to be sterilized! I think it's weird that she's helping the same people she's talking smack about. If I were you and you want to do charity work I'd go a different route or even start your own if you can.", "NTA. \n\nWe all need to learn to work with people who have different opinions with us, but this is just beyond the pale. Depending on his age, you definitely don't want your son exposed to this kind of rhetoric if you can avoid it.", "NTA\nI would absolutely not want to be in the same room as this person. Much less do charity work with someone who clearly does not care for those y\u2019all are trying to help. I would consider bringing this up to the board or organizers of the charities she\u2019s a part of. You shouldn\u2019t have to stop helping people because of her, and the people you\u2019re helping shouldn\u2019t have to be exposed to her either. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her so say something insensitive to someone in need.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you don't like hearing that shit, imagine how the clients feel, hearing it at a low point in their lives. Especially given the history of forced sterilization (I've met people that happened to, it's a huge thing that was never addressed or reconciled).", "NTA you want to help. you just don't want to do it around her. odds are more people don't want her either.", "If that's true they should express that sentiment with the manager of the charity. \n\nRacists, stop being cowards and just wear it on your sleeve so we can avoid you.", "She is way, WAY out of line. NTA. You'll find other, healthier opportunities, I'm sure.", "NTA - You deserve to feel comfortable and happy while volunteering. I'm sure she can handle volunteering with someone else or by herself.", "Info: are there other places/times you can volunteer that won't bring you into contact with her? Of course, volunteer work isn't something you *have* to do, but if you're passionate about it, there should be ways to get around working with her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and you should absolutely report her comments to the people in charge.", "Nta.  She has a Racist crappy attitude", "NTA. She quite frankly sounds atrocious and like a major AH.", "NTA. Anyone saying that it\u2019s just her \u201cdifferent opinion\u201d are of the same opinion and therefore see nothing wrong with such comments. Forced sterilization?? Prisoners dying from heat?? None of that is okay. You can always do charity alone or with someone else. Let whomever may be in charge of the organization also know about this woman\u2019s comments as I wouldn\u2019t trust her to do charity", "NTA you sound like you want to do good and you can.  Just do it elsewhere.  You are right not to associate with her and this group if they retain her.\n\nThere's a lot of people to feed! Find kinder people to do it with.  Thanks for helping.", "NTA, for somebody who\u2019s almost 40 I\u2019m surprised by this ignorant ass mindset. Though I guess at this point shouldn\u2019t be surprised by people like this anymore", "NTA. Not only do I volunteer and do peer support, but I'm on disability and depend on welfare and food banks. Her comments are barely disguised eugenics, and they are utterly vile and dehumanizing.\n\nShe should not be working with people in vulnerable situations since she can't be trusted to be professional and appropriate.If you can, report her comments to a higher-up in the organization.", "NTA I wouldn't associate at all with her to be fair", "Is she another volunteer? In which case ask to work with different people. Tell them why. \n\nIs she a part of the organisation? Then avoid them!\n\nNTA", "NTA. This woman should keep her Nazi-adjacent opinions to herself. \n\nYou should report her to the organization. If I ran the charity I would ban her from volunteering. She could say something like that to the people you\u2019re helping. If the organization you are volunteering with is decent, I\u2019m sure they want to treat people with dignity, not tell them they should be forcibly sterilized.", "NTA...I'm sure if we looked deep enough we could find a reason they should be sterilized. Both extremes are dangerous...far right and far left.....a professor once told me that it's like a circle and far right and far left bend around together and meet at the top of the circle and there righteousness in their beliefs makes them dangerous.....ie: Nazi Germany(Hitler, Himmler and the like)s and Soviet Russia (Stalin, Beria and the like.) I only use these extreme examples because forced sterilization is such a horrible comment to make about people you know nothing about.", "ESH - yeah that is a shitty thing for f36 to say, but you\u2019re really going to refuse to help *other* people just because another volunteer at this organization has a different opinion than you?", "YTA. She has a right to her opinions and to express them, just as you do.   It also sounds like you are judging her super harshly based on this one thing. There's obviously much more to her if she's volunteering.  Either way, to stop doing charity work based on discomfort over a differing opinion is just ridiculous.", "YTA...\nDifferent people, different strokes.", "Thank you!", "Thank you!", "Thank you!", "Thank you!", "I absolutely do not want to deal with women like OP's coworker.", "Yep, I will just do it without her and with my son.", "Would just be another volunteer. Thank you!", "Why do you people pretend that \"iT's jUsT a DiFfErEnT oPiNiOn?\" \n\nThere are wrong opinions out there. Like, say, eugenics, or killing prisoners in your charge extrajudicially by *heat exposure*.", "As someone who actually utilizes different charity services as a customer, I absolutely do not want to deal with women like OP's coworker and I would never expect volunteers to put up with inappropriate and gross coworkers.\n\nManagement needs to be alerted to her inappropriate comments before she causes direct harm to someone.", "Why do you people kowtow to straightup evil like that? Eugenics? Prisoners dying of *heat*? For fuck sake.", "She has a right to have literal Nazis opinions? Lol just say you agree with her crazy ass and go. Op is NTA and he doesn't even need to foster any kind of relationship with her", "People should be judged harshly for supporting eugenics (forced sterilization, neglectful murder of undesirables etc).", "And some opinions are wrong and make people AHs. OP never said she would stop doing charity work\u2014she just doesn\u2019t want to work with this specific person anymore and will avoid those specific events.", "And some people have outlooks (or \u201cstrokes\u201d) that are absolutely reprehensible and don\u2019t deserve to be tolerated.", "I've worked for charities for years. Sounds like her comments specifically undermine the philosophy of the charity. \n\nWill she have direct access to beneficiaries? If so, you should absolutely say something to the charity. That's a risk they will want to know about. \n\nAnd don't volunteer with her. She sounds awful.", "Yeah, I said it was a shitty thing to say.\n\nF36 obviously has no ability to actually execute on her bad ideas, so she\u2019s just tilting at windmills.\n\nThe only people being hurt by OP getting their panties twisted up are the people they could potentially be serving.", "Cool - tell management.

Why are you judging so harshly?", "Your bar for societal expungement is rather high. Do you like your bread butter side up or down ?", "Your attitude is why people like F36 get into power. Complacency.\n\nYou'll stand by and let them do anything at all.", "My point is, charity and volunteer work can be very challenging and taxing even without an unhealthy workplace atmosphere where coworkers are openly denigrating the vulnerable people they're helping. Unfortunately, not all customer experiences are positive and my own experiences volunteering at a food bank made it clear that a big part of the job is handling spoiled food and heavy bags/boxes. It's physically taxing.\n\nI think it's worth bringing it up with higher-ups before OP calls quits, but I wouldn't feel comfortable telling OP to simply deal with it out of some kind of moral obligation if he doesn't want to be around that kind of speech.\n\nEither the organization enforces their volunteers being held up to standards that are acceptable for a workplace, or OP is allowed to safeguard his peace and move onto a different task to get away from her.", "That's how you know she's evil. Look at how monstrous she is towards people that \"deserve it.\" \n\nGood people don't act like that.", "I judge reprehensible things harshly. Why don't you?\n\nAnd yes, forced castration is wrong. The fuck kind of question is that?", "Well, I think eugenics should have gone away with the original Nazis. Didn\u2019t realize that was so controversial.", "No, I\u2019ll keep working.  OP is the one saying they\u2019d rather just bail.", "You'll keep working to normalize this kind of evil as \"jUsT An oPiNiOn\"", "You\u2019re a strange bird.  I\u2019ve said multiple times that f36 is wrong.  This discussion is about OP\u2019s response to it.", "I'm not a bird. I'm three dogs in a man suit.", "And I've stated that I can do volunteer work at a different time/place. I'm not giving up for life, just for this occasion."]}
