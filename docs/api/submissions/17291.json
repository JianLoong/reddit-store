To get to know us better our neighbor asked if my husband and I would like to come over for dinner that night. I gladly accepted because I think it is important to have a good relationship with the neighbors. \nWhen I told my husband he asked me if I told our neighbor that I am a vegetarian. I don\u2019t eat meat since the age of 13. I just don\u2019t like the thought of eating something that once lived. But I hate talking about it because to me it is just not a big deal and I don\u2019t want people to make extra arrangements for my diet. In my experience there is always something for me to eat and I am fine with eating just side dishes or whatever. \nSo I told him that I did not mention it to our neighbor. My husband said that this was wrong since she is now preparing a meal for us that I might not eat and this will come of as rude. I argued that for me it seems rude to demand a special meal. \nOur neighbor did prepare a meal with meat but there were also potatoes and vegetables for me to eat and our neighbor didn\u2019t seem to mind me declining the main dish. \nWhen we got home that night my husband told me again that it was rude to not tell her I am a vegetarian and that me not eating the main dish must have offended her although she didn\u2019t say anything. We had a rather big fight about it and now I wonder if I really was TA for not giving our neighbor the heads up about my diet. \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1684141483, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i2r97/aita_for_not_saying_that_i_am_a_vegetarian/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That doesn't matter if it's a medical reason, or a personal one like being a vegetarian.  Not saying anything is going to run you into trouble.", "A very gentle YTA. By not informing your host of your dietary needs you run the risk of insulting them (if your vegetarianism doesn't come up & they assume you don't like their food), as well as annoying them by wasting their food & their time.\n\nYes, the host should have asked but you're an adult too & you can use your words to let them know what you (don't) eat.", "Well you made your neighbour waste money and time cooking something that you knew you weren't going to eat.  \nSeems pretty AH way to behave to me.", "YTA - it would have been embarrassing for the host if there had been nothing for you to eat. It would have been at that point you would have forced them back into the kitchen to make something special for you. It was just lucky there were a few thinks you could eat. What if the potatoes had been cooked in duck fat and the vegetables in chicken broth?  It would have been so much easier if you had mentioned you were vegetarian at the time of the invite.", "In this case, your instincts were correct, you had something to eat, and your neighbor wasn't offended. But it might not always go that way. So I have to say YTA, you should tell your neighbor about your restriction, offer to take something, and give them the option of backing out if they are worried about unintentionally causing harm. Or maybe just invite them over instead.", "YTA. How is it rude to say you have a dietary restriction?", "YTA ffs.  Tell people, your husband is right, it's a huge pain to go to the effort of making a nice meal only for your guest to turn around and say they can't eat the main dish.  It embarrasses your host for literally no reason and it's not hard to make a vegetarian friendly dinner, either with an alternative dish or just making a full vegetarian meal.  Plus if you don't tell people how the hell do you know the non meat dishes are vegetarian?  Gravy usually has stock of some kind in it, many vegetables can be cooked in animal fats (e.g. duck fat or bacon grease).  Anything that has gelatin in it...", "YTA\n\nIf you value animal life, you should understand that letting someone prepare some meat for you only for it to go to waste is worst than eating it\n\nSay you are vegetarian, and tell them to not prepare anything special, that yiu are fine with it and will eat the sides", "YTA. Knowing the dietary requirements of people before they come to dinner is important. You could have even said, \u201cI\u2019m a vegetarian, but don\u2019t make anything special I\u2019m happy with side dishes\u201d", "Some pretty ass about face behavior. So you don't like the fact an animal was killed to make food, so you don't eat it. But are more than happy for someone to prepare the meat just for it to go to waste? How fucking daft is that. Not only did the animal die to become food, it was then just made to go to waste. Great job Captain Planet.", "YTA, you should have told her you were a vegetarian.", "YTA. I agree with your husband about this. Ideally your neighbour should have asked if you had dietary restrictions, but as they didn't, it would have been better to give them a heads up. If is was a larger party where you could assume the neighbour already had plans for food, your stance would make sense. As they invited only youand are cooking especially for you, it will be disappointing when it turns out you can not eat what they cooked. Also, this might be the time there might not be any vegetarian side dishes, which would be really awkward for everyone involved.", "Mild YTA.\nYou definitely should've told your neighbor about your diet, but you were fine and had something that you could eat. \nIt's not impolite to mention a restriction to the person making your meal.", "YTA.

It is just polite to let people know your dietary requirements if they are cooking for you.\n\nAll you are doing is putting your host in an awkward position. When you don't touch the main part of the dish your hosts are going to ask why and be really fkn surprised you didn't tell them you don't eat meat OR they are going to keep quiet but assume you think the food is awful and you are a rude guest.

You really should point out dietary restrictions when invited. If you're afraid of coming off as confrontational, just prepare and practice a very basic spiel beforehand (about how you're vegetarian, but also totally fine with just eating side dishes/bringing something yourself/etc) that you can say whenever you're in such situations.

I would be happy to make a dinner that feeds a vegetarian guest well.\nBut I can see that there are a lot of people who would roll their eyes if they needed to do something vegetarian.\nSo if I were you I would have told that neighbour that I am vegetarian but don't need anything special and I'm fine with sides and don't take your time preparing meat for me.", "You do realise they making you a special meal regardless right?

Sister you need to tell people", "YTA. i understand how you don\u2019t want to be pushy, so just say that \u201ci am a vegetarian, but please don\u2019t feel pressured to cook a vegetarian meal for me, I am more than happy to eat the sides/whatever is available and my husband eats meet too.\u201d \n\nIf someone gets up in arms about being a vegetarian, then you don\u2019t want to be friends with them anyway.", "Letting people who are cooking for you know about your dietary restrictions is something that a ten year old can understand.

You're not making it easier on the neighbor, you're setting the neighbor up to feel ashamed that they didn't know that you wouldn't eat what they're making.", "Your neighbours budgeted, prepared and readied enough  appetisers/mains/sides considering you would eat as well. They're now stuck with food they thought you would eat but didn't. Not all foods refrigerate well, so leftovers could get trashed. \n\nA simple \"Sorry, not to be a burden but I'm a vegetarian and am happy to contribute by bringing XX dish\" could've been a possible response to avoid this. \n\nI get why you didn't want to be a burden but if you aren't upfront you may end up with nothing you can eat, which is awkward for everyone involved and was easily avoidable. \n\nYTA", "YTA. This happened to me once. I went out of my way to cook a nice meal, with ingredients more expensive than what we usually have, because I've learned to treat guests well. I ended up having to throw a lot away, since one of the guests did not want to eat it and only ate the salad - whereas I had even asked upfront if they had dietary restrictions or things they did not like -. I was offended that I had spent so much money to throw away and at the same time that in the end the guest had not a nice meal. So please, inform people what you eat and don't eat.", "YTA\n\nYou need to tell hosts what your diet is if it's something that has to be specifically prepared for.  \n\nYou were extremely rude.

If you don't want to tell someone you're vegetarian, be prepared to not be vegetarian that day.  \n\nShe didn't say anything because she had manners.  Something you lack.  If you want to stick to your decided diet, tell people what it is.", "No judgment, but I'm glad I read this thread. I'm like OP and never told because I thought it would put pressure on the host. Seeing these responses I'll tell in the future!", "I think it's okay to tell her you're vegetarian but not to worry about cooking anything special just for you.

That could be less mild depending on the price of the portion that they prepared for you which went uneaten. \n\nFor the record, plants and fungus are also very much living things. So despite your vegetarianism, you diet still consists of things that \u201conce lived\u201d.", "NAH\n\nI don't think this a a-hole situation, it's not that you were in conflict with the neighbour or something, but you must bear in mind that not communicating your dietary restrictions to your neighbor could lead to an awkward situation if there was no option at dinner that you could eat. The hosts would have felt at fault for not accommodating a guest.  \nIt's always best to be upfront about your dietary needs.", "NTA\n\nThe only polite way for this to go would be for the host to ask you if you have any special dietary needs.

He should treat you better.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a situation you can't win.

E.g. just to let you know I\u2019m a vegetarian, please let me know if that\u2019s a problem? Or even inviting them over to yours instead so you can cook a wonderful vegetarian meal for everyone.\n\nPS a meat eater demanding a vegetarian cook meat for them is very different to a vegetarian asking someone to take into consideration their dietary requirements.", "Plus also if you've bought and cooked portions of meat or fish, it's unnecessary cost and potentially food waste. Some meat and fish really don't reheat well.\n\nI'd be quite annoyed if someone deliberately did this to me. I almost certainly wouldn't want to invite them back a second time.", "Okay let's grant that such people exist.\n\n\nHow would withholding the fact you're vegan help with this at all? \n\n\nNow you're still being obnoxious and awkward, but you're also refusing to even try to the meal that they cooked for you, because you have a dietary requirement that you never mentioned.", "Having a \"big fight\" over something so inconsequential doesn't seem normal to me, I've been married 20 years. Accepting big fights for what amounts to him policing her behavior with others seems like the behavior of someone rather controlling and cruel from this. Especially after the fact, when its clear it wasn't a problem.\n\nThat it's come to reddit also suggests OP doesn't find this trivial and feels like she needs an external check.\n\nPeople, as a whole, need higher standards as to what to accept in their relationships. If your relationship involves big fights that are bad enough to send you to reddit, probably not all is well in that house. NTA vote stands."]}
