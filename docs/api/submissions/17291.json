To get to know us better our neighbor asked if my husband and I would like to come over for dinner that night. I gladly accepted because I think it is important to have a good relationship with the neighbors. \nWhen I told my husband he asked me if I told our neighbor that I am a vegetarian. I don\u2019t eat meat since the age of 13. I just don\u2019t like the thought of eating something that once lived. But I hate talking about it because to me it is just not a big deal and I don\u2019t want people to make extra arrangements for my diet. In my experience there is always something for me to eat and I am fine with eating just side dishes or whatever. \nSo I told him that I did not mention it to our neighbor. My husband said that this was wrong since she is now preparing a meal for us that I might not eat and this will come of as rude. I argued that for me it seems rude to demand a special meal. \nOur neighbor did prepare a meal with meat but there were also potatoes and vegetables for me to eat and our neighbor didn\u2019t seem to mind me declining the main dish. \nWhen we got home that night my husband told me again that it was rude to not tell her I am a vegetarian and that me not eating the main dish must have offended her although she didn\u2019t say anything. We had a rather big fight about it and now I wonder if I really was TA for not giving our neighbor the heads up about my diet. \nSo AITA?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you all so much for your answers. I see now that I could have handled the situation better. I will now tell in advance if this situation comes up again. \n\nAnd to clarify: I did tell our neighbor why I didn\u2019t eat the main dish at that night and not just left the food standing without any explanation. \n\nA lot of your comments helped me see the situation from a different perspective - I will learn from this.", "created_utc": 1684141483, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i2r97/aita_for_not_saying_that_i_am_a_vegetarian/", "score": 646, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That doesn't matter if it's a medical reason, or a personal one like being a vegetarian.  Not saying anything is going to run you into trouble.", "A very gentle YTA. By not informing your host of your dietary needs you run the risk of insulting them (if your vegetarianism doesn't come up & they assume you don't like their food), as well as annoying them by wasting their food & their time.\n\nYes, the host should have asked but you're an adult too & you can use your words to let them know what you (don't) eat.", "Well you made your neighbour waste money and time cooking something that you knew you weren't going to eat.  \nSeems pretty AH way to behave to me.", "YTA - it would have been embarrassing for the host if there had been nothing for you to eat. It would have been at that point you would have forced them back into the kitchen to make something special for you. It was just lucky there were a few thinks you could eat. What if the potatoes had been cooked in duck fat and the vegetables in chicken broth?  It would have been so much easier if you had mentioned you were vegetarian at the time of the invite.", "In this case, your instincts were correct, you had something to eat, and your neighbor wasn't offended. But it might not always go that way. So I have to say YTA, you should tell your neighbor about your restriction, offer to take something, and give them the option of backing out if they are worried about unintentionally causing harm. Or maybe just invite them over instead.", "YTA. How is it rude to say you have a dietary restriction?", "YTA ffs.  Tell people, your husband is right, it's a huge pain to go to the effort of making a nice meal only for your guest to turn around and say they can't eat the main dish.  It embarrasses your host for literally no reason and it's not hard to make a vegetarian friendly dinner, either with an alternative dish or just making a full vegetarian meal.  Plus if you don't tell people how the hell do you know the non meat dishes are vegetarian?  Gravy usually has stock of some kind in it, many vegetables can be cooked in animal fats (e.g. duck fat or bacon grease).  Anything that has gelatin in it...", "YTA\n\nIf you value animal life, you should understand that letting someone prepare some meat for you only for it to go to waste is worst than eating it\n\nSay you are vegetarian, and tell them to not prepare anything special, that yiu are fine with it and will eat the sides", "YTA. Knowing the dietary requirements of people before they come to dinner is important. You could have even said, \u201cI\u2019m a vegetarian, but don\u2019t make anything special I\u2019m happy with side dishes\u201d", "Some pretty ass about face behavior. So you don't like the fact an animal was killed to make food, so you don't eat it. But are more than happy for someone to prepare the meat just for it to go to waste? How fucking daft is that. Not only did the animal die to become food, it was then just made to go to waste. Great job Captain Planet.", "YTA, you should have told her you were a vegetarian.", "YTA. I agree with your husband about this. Ideally your neighbour should have asked if you had dietary restrictions, but as they didn't, it would have been better to give them a heads up. If is was a larger party where you could assume the neighbour already had plans for food, your stance would make sense. As they invited only youand are cooking especially for you, it will be disappointing when it turns out you can not eat what they cooked. Also, this might be the time there might not be any vegetarian side dishes, which would be really awkward for everyone involved.", "Mild YTA.\nYou definitely should've told your neighbor about your diet, but you were fine and had something that you could eat. \nIt's not impolite to mention a restriction to the person making your meal.", "YTA. Tell the person for goodness sake. I love to cook for people and I would be so embarrassed if I served a roast or similar to a vegetarian and it would be one VERY awkward meal. It is just polite to let people know your dietary requirements if they are cooking for you.\n\nAll you are doing is putting your host in an awkward position. When you don't touch the main part of the dish your hosts are going to ask why and be really fkn surprised you didn't tell them you don't eat meat OR they are going to keep quiet but assume you think the food is awful and you are a rude guest. Nice one s/", "YTA my last dinner party I did leg of lamb and it was expensive and took hours to braise. I\u2019d be pissed to find my guest couldn\u2019t even eat it and instead had the side salad when I could have put my efforts into something else they\u2019d enjoy.

Although I completely understand your logic behind it. \n\nI\u2019ve had people come to my home for dinner and not make me aware of their dietary requirements\u2026 it\u2019s quite disrespectful to my time and effort.", "As a host I\u2019d be upset that I had made a meal that one of my guests couldn\u2019t eat. \nYTA a simple \u201cdinner sounds wonderful and fyi I\u2019m a vegetarian\u201d was all that was needed.", "Soft YTA. You really should point out dietary restrictions when invited. If you're afraid of coming off as confrontational, just prepare and practice a very basic spiel beforehand (about how you're vegetarian, but also totally fine with just eating side dishes/bringing something yourself/etc) that you can say whenever you're in such situations. You don't even have to justify why you're vegetarian (I guarantee you most people don't care).", "The person with dietary restrictions needs to make them known YTA.", "Mild YTA.\n\nDietary requirements need to be mentioned.

I would be happy to make a dinner that feeds a vegetarian guest well.\nBut I can see that there are a lot of people who would roll their eyes if they needed to do something vegetarian.\nSo if I were you I would have told that neighbour that I am vegetarian but don't need anything special and I'm fine with sides and don't take your time preparing meat for me.", "You do realise they making you a special meal regardless right?

Sister you need to tell people", "YTA. i understand how you don\u2019t want to be pushy, so just say that \u201ci am a vegetarian, but please don\u2019t feel pressured to cook a vegetarian meal for me, I am more than happy to eat the sides/whatever is available and my husband eats meet too.\u201d \n\nIf someone gets up in arms about being a vegetarian, then you don\u2019t want to be friends with them anyway.", "Letting people who are cooking for you know about your dietary restrictions is something that a ten year old can understand. It's going to be much ruder to not eat the food when it contains animal products that it would be to say \"I don't eat animal products\" at the start. \n\nYTA. You're not making it easier on the neighbor, you're setting the neighbor up to feel ashamed that they didn't know that you wouldn't eat what they're making.", "Your neighbours budgeted, prepared and readied enough  appetisers/mains/sides considering you would eat as well. They're now stuck with food they thought you would eat but didn't. Not all foods refrigerate well, so leftovers could get trashed. \n\nA simple \"Sorry, not to be a burden but I'm a vegetarian and am happy to contribute by bringing XX dish\" could've been a possible response to avoid this. \n\nI get why you didn't want to be a burden but if you aren't upfront you may end up with nothing you can eat, which is awkward for everyone involved and was easily avoidable. \n\nYTA", "YTA. This happened to me once. I went out of my way to cook a nice meal, with ingredients more expensive than what we usually have, because I've learned to treat guests well. I ended up having to throw a lot away, since one of the guests did not want to eat it and only ate the salad - whereas I had even asked upfront if they had dietary restrictions or things they did not like -. I was offended that I had spent so much money to throw away and at the same time that in the end the guest had not a nice meal. So please, inform people what you eat and don't eat.", "YTA\n\nYou need to tell hosts what your diet is if it's something that has to be specifically prepared for.  \n\nYou were extremely rude.

If you don't want to tell someone you're vegetarian, be prepared to not be vegetarian that day.  \n\nShe didn't say anything because she had manners.  Something you lack.  If you want to stick to your decided diet, tell people what it is.", "No judgment, but I'm glad I read this thread. I'm like OP and never told because I thought it would put pressure on the host. Seeing these responses I'll tell in the future!", "I think it's okay to tell her you're vegetarian but not to worry about cooking anything special just for you.

You don't have to and you can always eat whatever they have available, since you said you didn't want to inconvenience them with your own dietary restriction.\n\nYour husband is also NTA because he's just being considerate of the neighbors and their efforts, to make sure that their food is being appreciated. \n\nIn the end, you both were being considerate in your own way.", "NAH but there's absolutely nothing wrong with mentioning dietary restrictions when specifically discussing meal plans. Just because your neighbour didn't say anything doesn't mean she might not have been upset that her efforts were slightly wasted on you, and I think your husband is seeing it from that point of view.", "NAH\n\nYou are probably *mildly* in the wrong, but not in a way that I think makes you an asshole. That could be less mild depending on the price of the portion that they prepared for you which went uneaten. \n\nFor the record, plants and fungus are also very much living things. So despite your vegetarianism, you diet still consists of things that \u201conce lived\u201d.", "NAH\n\nI don't think this a a-hole situation, it's not that you were in conflict with the neighbour or something, but you must bear in mind that not communicating your dietary restrictions to your neighbor could lead to an awkward situation if there was no option at dinner that you could eat. The hosts would have felt at fault for not accommodating a guest.  \nIt's always best to be upfront about your dietary needs.", "NTA\n\nThe only polite way for this to go would be for the host to ask you if you have any special dietary needs.

Her mother was shocked. Well duh, she trusts me not to be sneaking lard into the broccoli! (It\u2019s actually how I ended up vegan, I thought \u201cdamn this is pretty good. I don\u2019t even miss the meat!\u201d)\n\nAlso, your name is a work of art.", "Have you heard of paragraphs?", "Soft yta. I think you\u2019re overthinking the situation. You\u2019re not going in \u201cI want this specific dish\u201d. Youre just letting them  know your dietary restriction. Like, as an easy example, I like pepperoni pizza but will happily eat regular cheese pizza if thats what someone else wants. As an omnivore, i eat plenty of vegetarian food. I just dont think about it when I do. Ultimately, there is no vegetarian food, just food that doesnt contain meat.", "Girl just tell your neighbor next time. You can add on \u201cas long as there is a veggie side I\u2019m good, you don\u2019t have to make a main just for me.\u201d\n\nI would be kinda confused if I invited someone over and they didn\u2019t eat the main.", "NAH \n\nIm the same as you diet wise. Havent ever really eaten meat and I dont offer the information unless asked. They could have asked for dietary restrictions and you could have offered yours. All that aside, I know I hate when people make me special vegetarian meals in addition to whatever they make. It makes me feel like a burden plus im picky so I dont always love it which just makes me eat something I don't enjoy to be polite.\n\nMaybe have them over for dinner at your place and you could make a really good vegetarian dish? Just to show them the thought and offer of friendship was appreciated", "It's weird that your husband cares about this enough to have a big fight over it. It's not that big of a deal. NTA.", "Yeah exactly what if they had specifically gone down the butchers for a nice cut of steak especially!", "Even without that, it can be frustrating to have someone at the table serve themselves the sides as their main.  I didn't say anything at the time, but I've had someone take most of the garlic bread since they didn't eat beef and the meat was mixed through the pasta by the time it came to table.  I did think it very rude though since I was looking forward to having some garlic bread and I could just have used pork mince.", "My issue is that a lot of people (me included) cook to the number of people eating, while there was plenty of mash potato for you that might not always be the case when eating with a stranger for the first time.  However also being in a larger group with more overall food let's people be more flexible with the portions of sides.  In a group of 4 someone just eating sides usually means shorting other people on sides and a lot of meat mains don't have an equitable way to divide to make up the difference.  There's also some meals like certain stews where most of the dish is in together.", "Do you... do you boil vegetables when you cook them? I genuinely thought people mostly stopped doing that thirty years ago.", "\"I found this recipe for kale wrapped Brussel sprouts on a bed of asparagus, with some gluten free cauliflower and soy based gravy.\" Maybe I'm picky, but there are a bunch of flavors I'm not a fan of, and non-vegetarians the \"no meat\" thing confused with the \"less liked vegetables\" thing. I don't want weird vegetable combinations; I want the normal vegetables, just fried.", "My Big Fat Greek Wedding vibes\n\n\"He don't eat NO MEAT? That's okay, I make lamb\"", "Green beans, yes, which is common to have with potatoes and is a staple food.  It's also considered very odd to most people to not cook them with animal fat or broth.", "> because then hosts go out of their way to make something that nobody ends up liking\n\nI don't see why they wouldn't just fry or roast some nice veggies.", "These days people whose diet is vegan but aren\u2019t fully vegan use the phrase \u201cplant-based diet\u201d. \n\nAnd thank you for sharing your experience!", "Yta a simple information change a lot of things", "Without telling a person, you can get some fun stuff that go against your vegetarianism\n\nie using bacon grease to fry stuff.  Or meat based broth in \"vegetarian\" dishes.  \n\nYou may have have consumed \"invisible\" meat products.\n\nIt would have been appropriate to inform host that you don't consume meat but that you are more than happy to eat side dishes.", "YTA, you absolutely should tell someone you are a vegetarian if they are cooking for you. Say that BEFORE you agree to have dinner. Just like with any food restrictions.\n\nLet them know you're happy to eat sides or whatever, make it clear you're a 'low hassle' vegetarian, but COMMUNICATE. What if they were cooking a one pot dinner?", "Sane people will understand. Although I am not supportive of a vegetarian diet as a principle, I am not going to embarrass vegetarians either. It's their choice. Moreover, although I won't go the extra mile preparing a veggie burger, I would ask whether the person can eat anything from my offerings. If not, they should take care of their needs themselves.", "When I was vegetarian friends wouldn't invite me to dinner because it was too hard.( Australia in early 90s wasn't super vegetarian friendly without effort) .  Or they'd say you eat  fish right. I'd just say veges or salad are fine.", "Someone once assured me that I, a vegetarian, would be able to eat at an event because they were serving hot dogs.", "Yeah I\u2019ve heard that used, but I\u2019ve often seen those same people eat lobster and clams, but that might be a Maine thing.\n\nAnd you\u2019re welcome, it\u2019s always interesting to hear how other people use words.", "That's great.  I love this idea.", "Technically YTA \n\nI can understand why you wouldn't want to make a big deal of being vegetarian in order to not make a fuss. I was like that when receiving hospitality from others when I was younger but I have learnt that people would rather understand your needs so that they can cater to them. They want you to walk away happy. Denying them that satisfaction by not mentioning that you are a vegetarian is a little inconsiderate, even if you did it with the best of intentions.", "I generally agree, but just because the meat doesn't get eaten that night doesn't mean it's wasted. Leftovers rock!", "My blood family (brothers) would actively sabotage my meals when they found out I was vegetarian. I would even bring a vegetarian dish to share. They did this cuz they're AHs for real.", "Shrimp tree? Ridiculous, everyone knows shrimp grows on a  bush."]}
