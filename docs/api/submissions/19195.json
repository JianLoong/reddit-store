Is this the only time, as a long-standing tradition between you two? How long have the step kids been in the picture, and it sounds like you possibly live far enough away that you don\u2019t get to see all of these people that often?", "NTA. This isn't about ice cream. This is about niece having some one on one time with her uncle. Her dad may have remarried, but it doesn't mean that her relationships with her relatives have to change. Blending families is hard, and forcing the stepkids in on every interaction niece has with someone is only going to cause a lot of resentment. It's good for everyone to have some breathing space and to do their own things at times.", "Hmmmm.\n\nI think NAH? \n\nI understand it being a tradition and I think that's very sweet but I'm also a Mum and I can understand her being upset her kids are upset. \n\nIf they've actually mentioned feeling excluded though I think your brother and her should have pulled you aside and spoken to you about this privately and tried to work out a solution.", "NTA your neice has had her life changed drastically and now has to share a lot of her life without a choice in the matter. The little tradition is something that is hers and hers alone. She deserves to be able to hang on to it. The other kids are old enough to go get treats on their own if they want it and their mother is capable of facilitating that.", "Firstly, the tradition still holds even if you invite other people. You role modelling to niece that our family tradition holds more importance than people. Plus they are kids enjoying ice cream. It does not lesssn the value of your tradition with your niece. Neither is it too much to pay a cone of ice cream for two boys. \n\nBut you could have saved all the trouble by telling your sil that you wanted a one to one time with your niece and have private conversations with her. Perhaps, that would have been more understandable to other people.", "INFO: how long have the stepkids been in the picture for?\n\nHaving time with individual kids is important in blended families (and tbh any larger families) so that they don't feel like they're getting lost in the mix. \n\nBUT I do think it's also important to establish activities that everyone can enjoy together so that kids don't start to resent each other. If the family's been blended for a while then I think going for ice cream as a unit sometimes makes sense (perhaps choose a different shop to preserve your tradition with your niece?).\n\nAlso, if you have two additional teenagers who actually want to hang out with you then that's kind of a bonus niece and nephew, and I think that's really lovely.\n\nI'm leaning NAH if the stepkids are relatively new in the family, but YTA if they've been a blended family for a decade (not for the tradition itself, but for the handling of it)", "To me it depends on many things, like for example are there any other niblings around who don\u2019t get invited? What would you do if your niece had a friend staying over and she was there too? I get you not wanting to take them, but if the answer is: No other niblings around and yes you\u2019d take the friend too, then the correct thing is to invite the other kids. \n\nSadly pushing for inclusion usually ends up backfiring, some people would just avoid  ice cream altogether to avoid awkward situations in the future. \n\nIf the point for you is to spend quality alone time with niece, you\u2019ll have to find something else. Invite her for idk tennis playing, video game playing, something that is irrefutably just the two of you. Ice cream shopping is just going for dessert of course everyone wants some.", "INFO: why didn't you want to take them? Your comments make it seem like it's more about them being \"step\" kids, and less about individual time with your niece. If that's the case, then yeah you're the ass.", "Was she offering to pay for her kids to go? Did your niece want them to come? The boys are 15 and 17. It\u2019s not like you would have to chase after 2 little kids. What\u2019s the harm in letting them hang with you guys for one outing? In my opinion, it was a dick move unless she was expecting you to pay for them, but even then\u2026.it\u2019s freaking ice cream. It\u2019s ok to be the cool adult and let the kids hang with you while you spend $20 on some ice cream.", "INFO: Have your brother and SIL ever discussed feeling like you are excluding his wife's children before? Or was this the first time either of them brought it up?", "They are 15 and 17 they can buy there own damn ice cream. If they were 5 and 7 maybe I\u2019d say it would be a nice thing to do but at that age no chance NTA", "NAH\n\nI get that it is a tradition. \n\nI also get no one wanting to be left out either", "NAH.\n\nThis is something you and your Niece did before the stepsiblings were in the picture.", "NTA - This is a tradition for you and your niece. Plus, the stepkids are old enough to understand, they aren't little kids", "Eh I\u2019m gonna say NAH.\n\nI understand wanting to keep a tradition, but at the same time the step kids are also your niece and nephew. Maybe try to find something you could do with all three of them in addition to the ice cream? That way they\u2019re included and you keep your tradition.\n\nIt was kinda rude of your SIL to insist, but I understand making sure your own kids aren\u2019t excluded from things.", "NTA. You can have traditions that don't include everyone so as long as you don't exclude them from everything like holidays, birthdays, etc I don't see an issue with this. If the older kids wanted ice cream too then they could've went separately anyways because they're old enough.", "NTA, you\u2019re allowed to have a special thing that\u2019s just something you and your niece do", "NTA.  I think it\u2019s nice you have the tradition with your niece as long as you always treat the other kids well.", "NAH\n\nShe\u2019s not wrong for asking, she should accept no for an answer though. You\u2019re not wrong for continuing this tradition as is, either.", "YTA. It\u2019s an asshole move to take 1 of 3 kids out for ice cream.  Be a human being and consider their feelings.", "YTA. This is so strange!!! Maybe it's my culture but it's absolutely extremely awkward to just give your niece ice cream when you know they're there. \n\nDon't go over there then. Have them drop her off and do your own tradition. \n\nAnyone saying NTA are delusional and must be the type of people who don't offer to feed their guests and eat alone in the kitchen at dinner time.\n\n\nEdit to add: you must understand how HORRIBLE it feels for those 2 boys to never feel like they're really part of the family. It does damage over the years. I know people who's parents remarried and they're still not over how other people excluded them from family things because of no blood relations. It's extremely isolating. They're also your nephews..", "HOw long has brother been married to SIl?    She seems petty over an ice cream", "NTA. Your tradition. \nYou can build a diff new tradition at another time with all three. \nYour brother chose to marry her. You didn\u2019t chose to start taking her kids with your niece.

You don\u2019t have to but why wouldn\u2019t you want to?  They are kids.", "NTA these are not tiny children. Teenagers deserve to have their own people and relationships separate from their siblings, step or otherwise. You don\u2019t need to expand your traditions.

Because it is fine to have traditions that help keep a close bond with your niece. At the same time, your brother now has bonus kids and a larger family he is trying to establish as one family unit.

Mainly cause my siblings were always love and spoiled. Whereas I wasn't always. So my uncle and sometimes my grandpa would take me on outings as a kid and growing up. They wouldn't let my siblings come. Just so they can spoil me without having to spoil the other kids. They were loved in many different ways. But I was always left out of them with other family members. I also hate to say it but I'm so use to divorces. So it's like what if they divorce in the future.

I get having a little tradition going on, me and my daughter(5) to to a cafe close by monthly, she says no when her dad says he'll come too. \n\nIf the boys mum was so fussed about them getting ice cream she could take them herself, I'm pretty sure her parents and siblings if any do things with just the boys.", "ESH.\n\nWhat's the problem with taking the other kids?

They\u2019re old enough to know, you don\u2019t always get what you want.

You do not have to have a meaningful relationship with the other kids if you don't want to.  So much bs about it.", "YTA for excluding step kids, they\u2019re not supposed to be treated differently just because they\u2019re not blood relations.", "I think it\u2019s ok to have a tradition with your niece that is only for her, it\u2019s good to consider her as her life is changing. I myself couldn\u2019t leave two kids behind though, teenagers or not. It\u2019s just ice cream, it\u2019s fun to share, and a nice gesture because they\u2019re just teens. I\u2019ve been left behind while cousins went out to the carnival and such, and while I understood I had to stay behind sometimes, I\u2019m in my 30s and still remember who invited me places as a kid.", "So a tradition is a lovely thing, and its great to have this, but SIL is probably pushing because she feels like her boys are being slighted. The stepkids might not be your blood relations, but at the end of the day blood relations dont mean a dang thing, and your excluding two kids who may already be struggling with feeling unaccepted by thdir new family. And they are family now. Favortism can really mess kids up. Traditions can be expanded to include new people, and if you and neice are really so against adding the boys to the ice cream run why not try to include them another way? \"Hey SIL, this is tradition so its just noece and I, but maybe later this evening or tomorrow all the kids and i can do something.\" Unless these kids have done something awful or are terribly misbehaved, neither of which you mentioned and I feel like you would have had it been the case, there's no reason you can't make an effort. You are the adult here, and I feel like you aren't acting like it. Soft YTA with a hope you'll do better in the future.", "NTA", "NTA and SIL is rude.  I am guessing niece gets the short end of the stick at home, and that SIL makes certain her kids get everything niece gets, but not vice versa.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that her father remarried and choose to bring more kids into the mix doesn't mean you magically have a bond or an obligation to them, every kid is not gonna be included in everything and everyone's gotta learn that at some point, it's not cruel for you to want to keep things as they were and if niece isn't asking for them to be included, I don't see any reason to do so.", "YTA such a divisive thing to do.

If I was one of the nephews I'd have very clearly understood the message.", "YTA you're being rude not to include the step kids.", "Yta, they are your family now whether you like it or not. Might as well make it fun and bring em along other wise they gonna hate u and u will never have a relationship with them.", "YTA. You can take the other kids too. Traditions can be adapted.", "YTA.", "YTA.  Not because you want to spend one-on-one time with your niece, but because of the way you went about this whole situation from start to finish. \n\nYOU purposely and in your face chose to exclude your brother\u2019s stepchildren.  So unless these kids are hellions, which you most definitely would have included in your original post to support your YTA behavior, this decision was made to HURT people.\n\nIt was also very rude to take your niece away from HER FAMILY visit with your mother.  That was an engagement that they made and it was not your place to disrupt it.  \n\nSo now you\u2019ve not only purposely hurt the stepkids and sil, but you\u2019ve hurt your mom.\n\nAnd yes, what you did in this particular moment has hurt your niece too.

No. Does that mean OP should ignore/have nothing to do with SIL's kids? No. OP still has new family.

Or is the simple fact that it's by marriage and not blood just make the step kids less? You connect with people very closely when marriage isn't even involved. You can get very close to your best friend's kids and make traditions with them. Why are step kids an obvious status to not be close to.\n\nI can think of a couple of reasons why not to bring the step kids. If the step kids are generally horrible, well of course no one would even be able to form a closer relationship. If the step kids were horrible to the niece, you don't want to make her uncomfortable by bringing them along. On a more asshole tangent, if you simply don't believe the marriage would last, I guess I can understand why you wouldn't want to invest so much into people on a time limit. Though that assumption is going to be kind of fucked up a lot of the time.\n\nNone of that is in the post. It might even cause a problem. It could damage the relationship between the niece and step siblings. It could alienate the step kids from the family in general. It could cause issues in the brothers marriage as the wife sees her kids excluded. It could alienate the brother from the family if he does the right thing and distances himself from the family because he needs to protect his step kids.\n\nI just fail to see obvious reasons why excluding them, and it is excluding them, is an obvious thing.", "Totally agree which is why I put the \u201cadding to this\u201d caveat.

The kids were little when this was going on and now that they are grown, the grandparents are seeing how they treated the kids back then dictated the relationship they have today.", "Yeah, I had a grandmother like that too. But some of these AHs on here can't figure out why behavior like this is still wrong. It doesn't matter if the kids are 5, 10, or 15. Favoritism is still favoritism. \n\nI don't understand how some of these people don't see that it literally doesn't cost OP more than the $3 for an ice cream scoop to take the 2 kids with them. No extra time, no extra anything else. The kids' mother would probably give them money if OP is that much of an AH. I bet the niece wouldn't even mind. But no... it's MY tradition. I want it MY way. I want to make them feel less than.\n\nOP is a sad, sad little dictator who's teaching their niece to be an uncompassionate girl who won't understand why her step siblings won't like her very much.", "Did they ever live near Camp Lejeune?\u2026", "Absolutely - there is a slight change to break up the set though - \n\nSet of four = 9.99\n1/2 gallon scoop = 5.99\nBreaking up a set handling fee = 42.99\n\nWe accept all major credit cards, cash, gold, silver and rare gems.", "Uncle should just bring some ice cream home for the rest of the kids and start some type of different tradition with all three kids. The idea that no child should ever get individual attention is just ridiculous.", "Or if they were exposed to the water at Camp Legene", "Do you not get that its NOT about the ice cream? It's about being made to feel that you're not a part of the family. That you are worth nothing, and can just be left behind."]}
