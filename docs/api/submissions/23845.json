It's their job to teach him the difference between feelings, which come and go and just ARE, and behavior, where a CHOICE has been made about which feelings to focus on and act on. He has not been held accountable for his rude and disruptive behavior...in any setting. Until your parents impose consistent consequences, such as removing privileges and freedom for set amounts of time and with a requirement of respectful behavior, for antisocial behavior, your brother has no motivation to manage his emotions and behavior. Your brother doesn't \"need\" you. He needs active consistent parenting. Your parents are trying to offload supervising your uncooperative aggressive brother onto you. That relieves them of having to make any changes to their routines and makes rug sweeping their neglectful parenting and its results easier to continue. That's what they \"need\" from you, to sacrifice your peace so they can continue to avoid giving your brother the time, structure, active present parenting and support he needs.", "NTA\n\nThey can ask for favours but they need to respect the fact that No is a completely valid response", "NTA. Based on what youve written, Sebastian doesnt sound that much different from anyother kid caught in the weird spot between child and teen. Unless he is constantly destructive to himself or others, I dont see the need for 24/7 supervision. In your parents shoes, I would install a camera system and a ring doorbell. Theyll be able to check when he gets home and if anyone comes by. They need to write down some reasonable rules and expectations for him. Then they need to talk to him about how its going to work.", "> but what else is going on that you won\u2019t endure the little sh*t for even one afternoon? \n\nIt sounds like they're talking about every afternoon after school, not just one.", "Yes and there was no, \u201cone day\u201d or \u201cshort while\u201d follow up, just a flat no.

In the US, at least, it's a small minority of such people who participate in child care for siblings.\n\nIt's not normal to do this, no one needs to justify saying no to such a request.
