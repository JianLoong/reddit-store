It'd be great for you/another family member to step into the gap, but it's really on your parents to get to the root and address the underlying issues. Is this normal teenagery attitude gone unchecked, or is there some underlying trauma your brother is battling with alone? He may or may not choose to substantively participate in family or individual therapy, but finding someone he can feel comfortable talking to is a good first step. If he's cool with you, maybe you can just be there for him emotionally to vent to, or serve as a sort of liaison between him and your parents.\n\nAlso, has anyone asked him what he *wants* to do? Sports, art, computers, etc? Do they really *listen* to him at all? He's at that age where he probably wants a little autonomy over his life... and while at this point he needs to start rebuilding trust, it's on your parents to pivot their parenting to rebuild their relationship with him in order for their guidance to stick without as much pushback.", "INFO: Do you live with your parents?

At least with laps your not trying to do anything that's supposed to be \"graceful.\") Also the idea something is a \"reward\" rather than doing the normal activity but made cumpusitory, it's not so much a reward as a arbitrary change in mandatory activities. That can feel like a lie/double talk to kids. 12 year olds aren't stupid. They can smell BS. \n\nMaybe a better approach is have PE be mandatory but the activities can vary and kids can opt out/have choices about what they do.
