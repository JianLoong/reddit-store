Until your parents impose consistent consequences, such as removing privileges and freedom for set amounts of time and with a requirement of respectful behavior, for antisocial behavior, your brother has no motivation to manage his emotions and behavior. Your brother doesn't \"need\" you. He needs active consistent parenting. Your parents are trying to offload supervising your uncooperative aggressive brother onto you. That relieves them of having to make any changes to their routines and makes rug sweeping their neglectful parenting and its results easier to continue.

A \"favor\" is asking a family member to watch your kid in an emergency when your usual childcare fell through and you have work or something. Asking a family member to watch your behaviorally challenged pre-teen for 10 hours a week indefinitely is a part time job not a \"favor\"", "Focusing on Zumba allows the poster to blame the teacher for the kid\u2019s bad behavior.

In the US, only three states have laws regarding the age kids can be left home alone. And of those states, only one has a limit over 10: in Illinois, kids under 14 can't legally be left home alone.

Most of the time we had to play something involving a ball which I hated.
