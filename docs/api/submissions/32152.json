I put co-parent in quotations because I handle the kids 99 percent of the time (they live with me and I pay for all the expenses). Each kid visits their dad for 2.5 hours a week. This was his choice, as he is \u201cbusy running his restaurant\u201d.  This has been the past 6 years, so the kids have come to accept all of this as mostly normal. \n\nOur daughter, age 9, is dancing in the nutcracker. Opening night was Thursday, and I was in the front row.  She also performs tonight and over the weekend and has been very excited about this for some time.  She has talked with her dad about this over the weeks and she is expecting him to be at one of her shows. \n\nOn Monday of this week I texted her dad to remind him of the performance, provided him details of time and place, and asked if he would make it. He responded that he would \u201cget back to me\u201d. Since then, there has been no response. \n\nSo, internet strangers, it is now Friday night and performances are tomorrow and the following day. WIBTA if I do not follow up with him, let him \u201cforget,\u201d and my daughter is let down/disappointed?\n\nEDIT:  When I posted this, I think I was looking for confirmation that I would not be TA if I just let it ride without an additional follow up so that when my daughter was sad and disappointed I wouldn't have to feel it was my fault.  BUT a number of posts here made a good point that my daughter is worth the minimal (physical) effort of sending an additional text.  So I sent it, and following the good advice here, I let him know that in the future I will let him know the dates/times of important events but I won't be following up multiple times to confirm his attendance plans. \n\nThe resolution?  He responded immediately (\"Hey, I was just going to text you\") and told me he won't be making it.  I think it is better to know then wait/hope/anticipate his non-appearance.  I let him know he can phone our daughter in the morning to give her the news himself.  Even though I think he is definitely TA, I am glad I took the advice here and sent the follow-up.", "created_utc": 1701482792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188sxy7/wibta_if_i_let_my_exhusband_forget_our_daughters/", "score": 425, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I do not remind him, it is unlikely he will attend and then my daughter will be disappointed.

You\u2019re not his mother or his personal assistant, you\u2019re his ex.  It\u2019s not your fault if he can\u2019t get his act together and make it to something like this.  You even did the good parent thing and reminded him the week of the performances, with all the info he needed.  (And in all seriousness, I applaud you doing that - you had no obligation to do it, but you wanted to give him a good chance at attending by making sure he had accurate info and didn\u2019t have to act like a responsible parent and get the info himself.)  You\u2019ve already done more than you are obligated to do.  You made the effort.  If he can\u2019t manage to place more importance on his kid\u2019s recital than the things he keeps himself busy with, that\u2019s on him.\n\nI think it\u2019s sad for your daughter that her dad is barely more than a deadbeat, but it\u2019s not your responsibility to coach him into being a decent parent.", "Info:\n\nWhere is your daughter emotionally. Is she is the \"desperately wants to believe in Santa\" stage or is she in the \"I want to know the truth\" stage where she doesn't want to hear about magic because she has been disappointed too many times? \n\nI would do what you think is best for her. Does she need to know her Daddy is a flake now so she stops hoping or will you let her find out slowly as she starts to look at the world more carefully as she grows? \n\nMaybe see if you can tape the performance so if her father never shows, she can still show him her dancing?", "NTA\n\nYou're not his social secretary, or his diary. You've told him when her shows are (merde!), and now the ball is in his court. I hope the tickets aren't all sold out...", "NTA. You have given him the time and the place once. That should be enough. You are not his prosthetic brains. I feel sorry for your daughter, but maybe it is time that she sees a little bit of her father's prioritizing. You are not going to be able to keep it all hidden from her in the long run.", " NTA; hopefully he has his shit together for this. But from the sound of it, disappointing your kids might be a regular occurrence with him. Personally, though, I would still text a reminded for 2 reasons: one being, hopefully preventing your daughter from being hurt, and two so he can\u2019t try to blame you if he misses it. Cause you know he probably would.", "NTA - Covering for a neglectful parent is only going to cause more harm in the long run. I would suggest sending him one more message, something along the lines of 'Just a quick reminder, X's last shows are tomorrow and Sunday' and then drop it. Be prepared to comfort your daughter in the very likely event that he doesn't come through; don't lie to her, but be as gracious as possible to him, maybe saying it's possible he was busy, and if you're able to get a video of her performance that she could give him, that would be great. But overall, give him the rope and let him hang himself, while you take care your daughter.", "NTA, but I would still remind him. If him being there would make your daughter happy that\u2019s more important. Being a single parent in this situation is unthankful I am one, I\u2019d make it a point to not tell your daughter you had to remind him also.", "I used to facilitate my ex\u2019s relationship with our kids. I would prompt and remind. Then my counselor asked me why. He said the kids would eventually figure out their dad and then realize I helped him fool them. Who would they have to trust?\n\nSo I told ex i couldn\u2019t facilitate anymore. It wwas up to. him. The counselor was right.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter has talked to him about it on multiple occasions. You reminded him the week of the performance and provided him with details. Either he wants to be there or he doesn't. This isn't your responsibility to manage.", "NTA. \n\nYou can\u2019t force him or send him multiple reminders all the time. He\u2019s old enough to understand what is important for the kids, and should make an effort to do so. \n\nI have the same thing that I deal with, and I have dropped the rope. If she invites him and he doesn\u2019t show, it\u2019s on him. She will learn that she is not a priority to him and that will be their relationship moving forward.  \n\nIt probably happens more than you think and she\u2019s working it out herself. Prepare her for the disappointment though.", "You reminded him the week of the performance... that is all you need to do.\n\nDon't tell her \"daddy forgot\".. but \"I am not sure what happened... I reminded him on Monday.\"", "NTA for everyone saying that y-t-a because think of your daughter. Does her daughter need a father who only shows up if he's nagged into doing so. I think it's better for the daughter in the long run to understand who her father is.\n\nEdit:typo", "NTA - as the child of divorced parents, my good parent did a lot of covering for my bad parent in an attempt to make it \u201cbetter\u201d for me, but ultimately it led to more issues down the road and a much much larger heartbreak. Now in my late 30s and a parent I get it now, but I would have much rather known the truth at 10 and it would have saved so much hurt.", "NTA\n\nIMO you aren\u2019t responsible for telling your ex about important things more than once.  You aren\u2019t married to him any longer so not your problem.  \n\nHis own daughter has been telling him about the performance.  \n\nThere\u2019s this amazing app on most phones that lets you create a zillion reminders so you don\u2019t forget what\u2019s coming up.  Ideally he\u2019s using it to remind him of when\u2019s its time for his minimal visiting. \n\nRunning a restaurant can be tricky but ideally he has someone amphora can manage for the 2-3 hours needed to watch the play \n\nCurious OP do you not get child support from your 3k as you mentioned you pay the expenses for the kids as well as have them 99% of the time.", "NTA. He's not a dad. He's a sperm donor. \n\nI can't tell you how desperately I wish I could have the \"hassle\" of having to arrange things to go see a kid's ballet performance, or play, or band concert or soccer game or whatever. I'll never have that chance, and \"dads\" like you've described piss me off to no end. \n\nThe fact is you are your child's parent. You are not his. He's a grown ass adult and it's on him to keep up with his responsibilities. At the end of the day he's just destroying his relationship with his children on his own.", "NTA. You DID remind him and send him details. He hasn\u2019t forgotten, he just doesn\u2019t care enough to go. I\u2019m so sorry for your daughter, but this is in NO WAY on you.", "Seems to me all you'd be doing is propping him up to disappoint her later. I think all you can do is inform him of things and not directly talk shit about him. NTA good luck, one good parent is way better than none.", "Sorry, I'm still stuck on the fact that he only spends 2.5 hours a week with them. Heck, out of the month, that's not even a full 24 hours. Your daughter, even at a young age, might already know her dad won't be showing up she's just hoping like kids do. Do you do this reminder stuff all the time, and he still doesn't show up for important events? Heck, this is more stressful for you than your daughter. I personally would stop. You can't force him even if it's for your children. Do you have to remind him to get the kids for 2.5 hours a week?", "NTA- you did remind him.  You can't force him to be present for her. \n\nI'm sorry for your daughter.  It's sad.", "You were already above and beyond by telling him the first time.", "You already told him. Your daughter has told him.   He has a phone the have calendars.  You are not his PA    \n\nNow he gets to fuck it up all by himself if he forgets", "NTA, but please remind him anyway. You are describing my dad and in hindsight I\u2019m so glad my mom made it about me every time.", "NTA. You are not his secretary or his google calendar. If he truly cares about the kids, he will find a way to remember important events.", "NTA but if she were mine, I'd ask her if she wants me to call her dad again. Then you can call him and she can see that you tried. It gives her shitty dad one last chance to not disappoint her. And she'll remember you trying.", "Even if you do everything you can to cover up for his failings, eventually your daughter will figure it out. You\u2019ve done your due diligence in informing him of the event. It is his responsibility to complete the task", "NTA \n\nWhatever you decide, I will not be sending any judgment your way. \n\nI like the idea that others have proposed to remind him once more, let him know you have his ticket, and then let him know this is the last time you are facilitating his involvement. \n\nGood luck. Will you update us, please?  I hope your children will be well.", "You gonna wipe his ass for him too?

I\u2019m guessing never. Don\u2019t remind him on this or anything ever again. He can learn how to prioritise his kids like you have.", "I had a deadbeat dad like that. I have so much respect for my mom and your kids are so lucky to have you always putting them first.  I promise you that\u2019s all that matters in the end - they feel loved and safe, thanks to YOU. \n\nI think you gradually rein in your hand holding. They\u2019re going to figure out eventually that they\u2019re not his priority. They probably already have. \n\nCall him this one time, give him the tickets, then explain that you won\u2019t be doing it anymore.", "In my opinion you tell a grown adult about the details of an event once after that it\u2019s on them to remember. I always do so via text so it\u2019s in writing with a timestamp. His priority isn\u2019t his kids otherwise you would not be writing here just let the chips fall where they may.", "Who will be hurt by this? That\u2019s the question you need to ask yourself. Will you be hurt if he isn\u2019t there? Will he be hurt if he misses a performance? No. Your daughter will be hurt if he isn\u2019t there. Remind him. A text to remind him will take less time than it did to post your dilemma on Reddit. It\u2019s annoying. It\u2019s unfair. It\u2019s also for your daughter.", "NTA how many reminders does he need? Are you going to pick out his socks and belt too?", "NTA.  There is only so much you can do.  You are being the best you can be for your child.  \n\nBeen there done that.   At a time like this I messaged once and once only in caps. \n \nYour child needs and wants you to come to blah.  Please try to bother for his sake \n\nHe didn't.  He never got any more invites.  \n\nHe also got a child who from that moment was hurt forever and that is on him.", "Nta. You can\u2019t keep protecting him.", "Nta.

This is a tough one, but I guess it\u2019s what is best for your daughter.    I have a feeling though, that one day he will let her down anyway.", "Soft YWBTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t have any responsibility to dad and honestly the most effective thing to do would be let him fail. BUT\u2026 your daughter is the casualty here. And she\u2019s 9. If it doesn\u2019t cost you much time or effort, go above and beyond to make her happy. She will learn soon enough that she isn\u2019t a priority to him, and will have plenty of disappointments ahead. But it doesn\u2019t have to start tomorrow. \n\n(PS this is coming from someone who was in a very similar situation as a kid, and always appreciated the times when my mom called my dad to tell him to step up and attend something that was important to me.)", "ESH - Yes, you shouldn't have to do this. I know that. You know that. However, you also know that your ex *will* forget and your daughter *will* be disappointed. Don't hurt her feelings just to score points.\n\nBe the better person. Not for him. For her.", "Soft YWBTA, not because of your ex-husband\u2019s feelings but because of your daughter\u2019s. \n\nYour ex-husband is an adult and it should be up to him if he wants to be involved in his children\u2019s lives and it isn\u2019t your responsibility to chase after him. However, it sounds like your daughter really wants him there. So doing right by your daughter would be to text him and remind him, even though you have already done so. I get that it isn\u2019t really your responsibility to get your former husband to come, but think of it as if you are doing it for your daughter not him.", "NTA. HOWEVER, ask yourself a couple questions. 1) how much will this impact/hurt your daughter? If you think it\u2019s more than a little then I would remind dad. 2) are you sure you are not doing this to be petty? I wouldn\u2019t blame you at all if you are. But I would also say set that aside and remind dad.", "YTA, but tough decision. I'd give him the benefit of the doubt and shoot him a text reminder - this is *FOR YOUR DAUGHTER*, not for him.

Explain to your daughter that her dad decided to forget about her performance.", "Follow up with him for your daughter not him.", "She's 9. Let her have a dad who cares about her for a few more years. If he continues to not make her a priority she will find it out, hopefully when she's a little older and can better understand that he is the problem, not her.", "All that is required for evil to prevail, is for those that know to do good to do nothing.\n\nWhat is best for your daughter?", "In general it\u2019s not your responsibility to remind him and keep him on track,however, this is more about your daughter\u2019s feelings and you should put those first. Love over pettiness.", "I have an x like this and a daughter she is 21 now.\n\nPersonally I think she is to young to have her heart broken.  I would call him and explain how important this is to her and her heart will be broken if he doesn't show and you will murder him if he doesn't show /s.  He doesn't deserve the reminder but your daughter does.  Then slowly through out the years let him flake on less important things.\n\nYou can call him and remind or pay for therapy later on for her abandonment issues.   \n\nI did this for years because I didn't want my daughter to have daddy issues and have to go get her off the pole later in life.  I called it keeping her off the pole Campagne.  He would show up and pretend he was Dad of the year and I wanted to shoot nails out of my eyes at him.", "So you text a bunch of strangers rather than just texting him?

He never planned on going his restaurant comes first.", "YTA. Be the bigger person, for your daughter\u2019s sake.

You would be an asshole because it's not really fair to let this hurt your daughter. He doesn't deserve another reminder, but you wouldn't be reminding him for his sake. It would be for your daughter's sake. At a minimum, you need to have a discussion with your daughter about why Dad isn't there if you really don't want to remind him", "ESH - This should be about your daughter, not her parents. \n\nI deeply understand the desire to let him fail, but imo your daughter\u2019s broken heart is too high of a price to pay.", "wtf you dont remind him for you, you remind him for your daughter.

Are you trying to send a message to your ex that you're not responsible for his calendar, if he wants to look like he's making an effort, he has to actually make an effort? Are you just trying to make him look bad? \n\nI think it's worth it to communicate intentions, especially if it's because you're done bearing the emotional labor of keeping both parents engaged in their kids lives. Just a simple \"Just so you know, going forward I will let you know about upcoming events, but I won't be reminding you, it's up to you to remember and make it work\". Up to you when that is, but it never hurts for everyone to be on the same page, especially if there might be fallout from this, it's good to establish \\*why\\* so you can't be so easily painted as petty or vindictive.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is the last reminder for events and milestones that you will receive from me.\u201d", "Yes, the predictable \"It's women's fault when men don't take accountability for their own actions.\"\n\nYou're a hack. Get some new material, bud.", "I get the urge to place blame over that, but it's fact that abusers (and neglect is a kind of abuse) can be wonderful, attentive, thoughtful partners - until they have you in a vulnerable position. It's not always something you can predict, and very hard to see through, because until they are in a position where you are vulnerable and dependent on them, you don't see that side of them -- they really are amazing partners. \n\nAfter marriage and after you have children are both very typical times for the mask to drop, because they (whichever gender they are) feel like the other person is now in a position where they are unable to leave them, so it's safe to drop the mask - or start dropping it in small escalations over time, more typically. \n\nIt's unfortunately very common -- and OP's not at fault for failing to predict the future, here.", "Everyone saying NTA but no one acknowledges that just because technically it\u2019s not her job to tell her ex that it\u2019s all okay. Meanwhile the kid doesn\u2019t care about that drama she just wants to see her dad. But moms too busy trying to win her daughter", "No. In fact op needs to step back completely from being his personal \"care about your kids coordinator\". She's already put in more effort than she should and ultimately they're just dragging the disappointment out.", "You WNBTA, but your daughter is going to be sad and hurt if he's not there, and when it happens, you might feel better about all her emotions if you send that one more text.  \n\nMultiple performances of the nutcracker is a big deal. It's sad he might taint this memory for her.  I'd send the text in hopes he doesn't.", "Yep. There was a notepad on the fridge. It often said something like \"kids in June???\" meaning that there was something on for one of us in June. But not what or exactly when. \n\nI'm an \"old lady\" now (30s) and if it's not in my calendar, it doesn't exist. Considering we all have calendars/alarms strapped to our hands, there's no excuse.", "I disagree.  It\u2019s not her job to protect her from parental abandonment. It\u2019s his.   Mom is not accountable for dad\u2019s actions he is.   She\u2019s not his mom, wife or personal assistant.  You\u2019re basically asking her to lie to the child.", "I agree with this comment.", "I like this response!", "I feel this is fair and putting in text. You communicate your expectations and your actions in the future. Ball will quite literally be in his court. It'll up to him to pick it up.\n\nI would remind him once more and this text. Big hugs.", "So you just expect this woman to cover for this shitty father until when exactly? How long does she have to do all the parenting and make all the finances, all while pretending this useless grown adult is Super Dad? How exactly is that helping anybody except this man to continue to pretend he isn't a father?\n\nHaving a resentful and stressed primary caregiver isn't good for children, either.", "she chose a deadbeat to father her children. Its her responsibility to mitigate the damage. she needs to call to at least attempt to keep her child from being disappointed.", "I know, right???!!!!", "Of course it is her Job to protect her. The kid is 9. Letting a child willingly get hurt is never ok. When she is older and can rationalize relationships, she will be able to make up her own mind. Not now. OP, WBTA", "Yes it is her job. She picked this schmuck to father her child. She doesn\u2019t get to protect her kid from everyone *but* the deadbeat she chose, she needs to protect her kid from everything she can. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to lie to the kid, she needs to text/call her father one or two more times. *That\u2019s all*. She can suck it up and play social secretary *for the good of her child*. It\u2019s a small price to pay for her child\u2019s happiness.", "This is such a stupid take. The best way to keep her child from being disappointed would be to cut the dad out entirely.", "Yes it\u2019s mom\u2019s job to protect the child but not from her dad.  Nine year old children are way smarter than you think.  The child is already figuring it out.   I speak as a parent of two children whose father abandoned them.", "Mom can't force the dad to go. Even if she re-reminds him, there is no guarantee that he will make time. \n\nIt's good for his daughter to learn young that he will not make time for her but that her mom will always be there. As long as OP allows her to feel those big feelings and validates them, she's NTA. \n\nI say this as someone who had a deadbeat dad and a mom who kept trying to convince me he really cared. It just made me feel like his image was more important than my emotions surrounding being abandoned.", "You are blaming a mother for not being psychic and knowing the relationship would break down and he would become a dead beat.... Wow. \n\nMy children were all born into a marriage that I thought was stable. Turns out it wasn't, their father was happy to leave the home and see them 3 or 4 times a month. I didn't see that coming but according to you I should have. \nPlease tell me where I can learn this skill.", "Who should pay the price of that, you or your kids? Especially when the price is a text or call, compared to a child\u2019s immeasurable heartache over their parent missing a formative performance. Mom needs to suck it up for her kid\u2019s sake."]}
