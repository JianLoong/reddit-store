Would you financially support her if she took photography and business courses?", "NTA. Starting your own business at 18 with no real training or even business classes is a recipe for disaster. Perhaps there's a compromise to be reached here where she needs to work for x number of years with a professional photographer and learn from them. After that, if she presents you with a solid business model, complete with expenses and it's well thought out, then maybe you'd consider using your fund for her business, but just giving her that money now, straight out of high school would be a colossal mistake because this money was intended to set her out on a great start in life and this won't do that.", "NTA I think your offer for photography and business courses is amazing! It is a flooded industry and she needs to learn how to stand out! She wants to be an adult and start a business instantly without learning the ins and outs of running a business. She may be about to find out how tough it really is. It is your money and you decide how it is spent.", "NTA Starting a business sounds easy, but is not. Ask her for her businessplan, that will force her to think about her business and it will tell you whether she's got a good head for it. Then you could always consider to invest in her business. I think your way of going to college and learn about setting up a business and photography is smarter, but that apparently is not her path yet. Giving her money for setting up the business is most likely wasting it...", "NTA. I own a business and my advice to her would be to get a business degree, even an associates. Or you might also be willing to pay for her for a certificate or general business training. I'd love to be able to do that. \n\nEither way NTA. Realistically very few people will have a photography business that supports them entirely, so personally I'd keep that money aside for if she realizes she does want/need a career education.", "NTA what she is asking is extremely risky on all fronts. The money is for education not for starting a business. There's no favorites being shown. IF You gave her the money for another reason other than school it could be argued you were playing favorites with her allowing it to be used for unintended purposes.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA. Your daughter knew her entire life that money was for educational purposes. So you\u2019re well within your right to refuse her, and offering up the classes in her area of interest was a great compromise. If I wanted to start my own business, business classes would be the first thing I\u2019d look into. She\u2019s eager to be an adult, I get it. But starting a business is hard and running a successful business is even harder, so I feel like you\u2019re doing the right thing by sticking to your original stipulations and only using that money for furthering education.", "NTA. Photography business? You mean the thing anybody can do with their iPhones these days? I\u2019m 20 and most friends I know that wanted to do photography professionally in high school now do it as a hobby and to build a portfolio, and have been doing it for years. They still can\u2019t convince people they know to pay for their services. There\u2019s only certain occasions someone hires a photographer (weddings, big events) and they expect them to show up with the best equipment and to edit the photos afterwards professionally. If she doesn\u2019t want to be stuck taking passport photos, her best bet is to find something else she\u2019s passionate about. Tell her that not every hobby needs to turn into a profession. Also, if she\u2019s adamant that she knows how to run a business, tell her to prepare a business plan for you. After all, it\u2019s an investment and that\u2019s how it\u2019s done. Make sure there\u2019s a competitor analysis in there as well. With any luck, she\u2019ll realize she has no idea what she\u2019s doing by the end of it.", "NTA. My older brother, while working a full-time job, is an extremely gifted photographer. He's traveled all over the world to capture truly amazing moments. He's promoted his photography to ad nauseum with very little reward. He received endless kudos, but not much of a bite by way of compensation. Your advice to your daughter is spot on to get an associates degree in business and photography. Have her visit an accomplished photographer or studio to get an idea of how hard that road is.  Stand your ground.", "NTA, but you should save that money for when your daughter wants to continue her education. Photography only worked for Brooklyn Beckham, and only for a short while. But that's only because he's already rich.", "NTA. I would advice your middle child to take some sorry of classes in photography and business so she has some knowledge. And those classes you can provide uses the money that you saved up. You have a reason to set aside money for a particular reason and that is education. That money was not meant for a start up.", "NTA; your daughter that wants to start a photography business doesn\u2019t even know \u201cwhat she doesn\u2019t know yet\u201d and even a certificate in entrepreneurship or small business would be useful.  It\u2019s not all unicorns and rainbows. If she is too foolish to take you up on the generous offer use the money for your own education; it\u2019s never too late.", "NTA. It\u2019s a parent\u2019s job to encourage their child to be as successful as they can. You\u2019re right in saying people with experience start a business and fail. Nearly half of all new businesses fail in the first 5 years. What happens 5 years down the road if her business isn\u2019t a success? What will she have to fall back on? \n\nYou\u2019re not playing favorites; you\u2019re giving her a reasonable dose of reality that all parents should AND providing her with a very reasonable alternative.", "NTA. Your suggestion is reasonable, and it's your right to use the money however you want. She knew the rules when she decided to skip education altogether.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give her the education fund for purposes other than education. She should understand what it was for and, if you give in to her requests, you *would* actually be playing favorites. She should be mature enough to understand that if she\u2019s planning on owning a business by herself. However, I\u2019m not sure why you are planning to start charging rent if she decides to work instead of study? Is there a time limit for other siblings?", "NTA- suggesting doing business classes is a smart thing and would help her know what to do.\n\nIf the money has always been ear marked for college/education then tell her that if in a year if she wants to do the classes for photography or business then she can.", "NTA.  As someone married to a photographer, it is not easy to get that business off the ground.  Since daughter is so young and likely has no clue about starting a business, I would encourage her to take at least some sort of photography, business, SEO, and/or web page design classes.  Professional equipment is indeed expensive, but you also have to worry about branding, being seen, the local competition, contracts, and how to manage and maintain business functionality and finance.  Not saying she's incapable of these things, but it's not as easy as buying equipment.  Especially if she intends to make this a career.\n\nInfo: OP is the money available for one-off classes that aren't necessarily part of a degree or 2-4 year program?", "NTA, I am someone who went to college for photography, but only got an associates due to my Community College not offering bachelors degrees, and I am STILL having a hard time getting my business going because I feel like there is so much more I should've learned. Yes it is very easy to be comfortable using a camera. But owning a photography business is more than just snapping a shutter, applying some edits, and sending it on its way. She needs to understand how to use studio lighting systems, lighting from various angles, appropriate methods and styles of posing models, and most importantly of all: how to actually run and manage a business's financials and the legalities that are involved with taking people's photos.", "NTA \n\nRunning a photography business is constant stress and she has no clue of what it will feel like after a few years. She would be waaaaaay better off earning a degree that gets her job security while she does a photography side hustle. Feel free to pass this on. Love, Another Wedding Photographer", "NTA. You dont just pick up a camera and call your self a photographer you offered a fair middle ground. In between classes she could work on building a portfolio as an amateur photographer and building a following on social media.", "NTA. It's your money. You made stipulations for its use and you're sticking to it. You're right that she should take courses first. And maybe she'll figure that out when she tries to take out a small business loan and has to give them her business plan. Right now she just doesn't want to put the work in. Expecting the instant gratification. And that's not likely to work", "NAH. She\u2019s not an A but it does sound like she may need further parenting then a yes/no on financing.\n\nDoes she have a business plan? Does she know how to make one?

What kind of photography is she pursuing?

If she needs more knowledge to start (the most likely scenario) help her research business and photography programs that would help.\n\nI would also go through the curriculums of her accepted colleges. There\u2019s likely pathways there that would benefit her that she hasn\u2019t discovered. \n\nYou can keeps this as a yes/no question, but I think the better thing to do is work *with* her.", "NTA.  She wants to start a business doing photography without any photography or business training...has she interned with anyone who is a photographer?  does she know she will need to do quarterly taxes and how much she needs to set aside for this?  what camera does she have and will it take the quality of pictures she needs to be able to take?  what editing software does she already have and how good is she at using it?\n\nTell her for each semester of community college she takes you get her something towards her business for her to start training with...software, camera, intro meeting with an accountant and or business consultant.", "NTA but ask your daughter to produce a business plan on how she plans to move forward,  costings, marketing, equipment, premises,  insurance , etc and make a more informed decision then. I understand and admire her desire and enthusiasm but it takes more than that to establish a successful business .", "Nta\n\nShe can certainly start a photography business whilst doing higher education.  \n\nThat said it is worth evaluating if there's a reason your daughter feels that you don't value her as much and favor her other sibling.  It may be worth doing family counseling with her to get a clearer picture of her grievances and learn how you can show her respect and build a healthier relationship with her.", "NTA, but i. Saying that some people are not meant to go to college. Some find school to be stifling and just need to get out into the world.", "So she has to continu studying to keep free housing and board. Did they know this too? Or did you just add this on? INFO", "NTA - Tell her you WILL help with photography and business courses, because those will help her in her chosen field.", "NTA\n\nIt's your money and you've been clear that it's for education. I will say, there are options here that I think would maybe result in less animosity. \n\nAsk your daughter to present you with a full business plan. Just like she would have to if she wanted a bank loan to start the business. She doesn't have to start college for several months now. For now, she can enroll in one of the colleges that accepted her and she has until X date to present her business plan to you. She'll have to include the works: market analysis, plans for marketing, pricing plans, forecasts of her breakeven point, short and long-term budgets, etc. \n\nThen if you know anyone who either has a similar freelance type business or who works with bank loans or if you can find a professional photographer who is willing to let you pay them to asses your daughter's proposal, you can review it along with that person.\n\nOne of two things will happen. Either your daughter actually has this all really well planned out and somehow has the business acumen to know how to plan a business successfully and financially responsibly. In which case I think it would only be fair to give her the money or at least give it to her as a 0% interest loan. Or she'll fall short and you can show her where she still needs to learn and explain what educational coursework would help her build a sounder foundation for her business after she's done with school.", "NTA\n\n Being young and wanting to tackle the world after graduation is a real thing. This comes from lack of experience and grand ideas. Eventually life has a way of humbling us really quick with reality. \n\nHold firm on the money being used for education. She is looking for the quick shortcut to her dream and not realizing that her dream needs education. Running a business is no easy task. Many fail within a few years. People dump loads of money into it for it to fail and cost them greatly. The competition in photography is massive. Going in with no clue on the things involved in running/owning a business is never good. It's more than marketing and equipment. It's insurance, contracts, payments, taxes, overhead cost, liability, etc. Those are just a few things out of the many things involved in owning a business.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter really should accept the education offer and start her business as a side hustle.", "NAH, at 18, still in high school, she does not have a clue about running a business.  Also, I doubt many people would trust an 18 y/o to take pictures for once in a lifetime events (weddings and Baptisms spring to mind).  However, if she agrees to work with an experienced photographer for an agreed upon amount of time or take business classes and can set out a plan, I would agree to help with basic necessities such as a second camera, lenses etc. to start as a working photographer while taking classes or workin with an experienced photographer. I think it\u2019s about working within the spirit of the agreement rather than a flat \u201cno\u201d.   I also think that college degrees are not the be all/end all accomplishment they used to be.  Talent and creativity cant be taught . Business skills can be taught and there is way more to learn about starting a business than simply being a talented photographer.", "NTA; suggestion from another parent of a daughter who has the same idea, I told her we will help out once she\u2019s completed some formal business courses and a proper photography class at the county college. If she make it through and puts the work we are going to help w/ camera lenses and website. Best of luck", "NTA. If I had a dollar for every \"photography business\" being advertised in local pages, I'd be able to quit my own job. Your daughter needs training to be able to run a business successfully. Whether that's to intern and work for an established professional, or to go to school. You are approaching this like any investment you have saved money for. You are willing to invest in setting her up long-term for her future. If she was serious about this business, she would be taking the needed steps to do it well. If she went to a bank for a business loan with this plan of hers, they would laugh her out of the office. Her proposal to you is no different. It's a bad risk, plain and simple.", "NTA. I know a lot of incredibly talented professional photographers, and most of them still have some kind of day job. One wedding photographer I know - who has been doing this for 20 years - does it full time, but she\u2019s been featured in a ton of national publications and she\u2019s highly sought after. \n\nAn 18 year old starting a photography business is fine, but she needs to do something else to make a living while she tries to build a business. I see so many young women on FB starting photo businesses. Their work is mediocre and they charge next to nothing just to get clients. But most are SAHM\u2019s and they don\u2019t really need the money, so that\u2019s fine for them. But it\u2019s not practical for someone who wants to build a legit career.", "NTA, and I like your approach to funding education - the money doesn't belong to the kids, it belongs to you and your wife, but you are willing to put it towards specific things (education, in this instance).   At the same time, you're not forcing your kids to follow a specific path. \n\nOne thing that you might want to consider - but only if you're genuinely serious about it -  is treating your 18 year old's idea in a strictly-business manner. Have her put together a business plan and present it to you. She needs to be able to come up with an exact amount of money she will need (and from what sources - you, herself, small business loans? any other contacts?), how she will use that money (a studio? advertising? transportation to/from gigs? equipment? assistants/staff?), and how she's going to treat this - is it supposed to be a gift with no strings? a loan? and investment/ownership share of her business?\n\nI'm just guessing here, but I'm guessing she's pretty good at it and passionate about it, but is underestimating what it takes to really run a business. It's hard - it's not just showing up and taking photos.  Your advice to attend at least a community college with some business courses is fantastic, but she might not be ready to hear it yet. Maybe make that a condition? Can she part-time her photography as a side business and take classes part time while living at home?\n\nAgain, don't have her develop a business plan unless you are going to honestly listen to her ideas and would genuinely be willing to contribute if she has her stuff together - it would be awful to do that and pull the rug out after. Just a thought to consider.", "NAH, why can't she do both? Why can't she go ahead and start her business and still go to classes? I think it's a great plan to take photography classes and business classes, but there's no reason why she can't go ahead and start it up. She won't be making much money doing it, but working towards her goals on the weekends and evenings isn't a bad thing at all and she'll be gaining experience along the way.", "I\u2019m going NAH at this point. I can see how, from her perspective, she\u2019s not just asking for a check to run off and have fun, she has specific business ambitions and sees the assistance received by her sibling. On the other, I see your point and valuing education.  \n\nOne thought: Perhaps ask her for a full write-up. A business plan, projected budget, expected income, marketing plan, the whole nine yards. If she can produce all that, maybe she\u2019s ready. If not, well, maybe it will help her see why she needs business classes.", "NAH, it sounds like you made the rules clear, and they sound completely reasonable.\n\nIt may be worth it to walk back your position a bit just so the kid feels heard and views you as fair- within reason.  Can't let the point of your position be lost.\n\nI'd say that making the kid pay utilities on top of not offering the business support is what's making them feel targetted.  It's not an unreasonable idea, but it wasn't (as far as I can tell) part of the initial deal, so it feels like a blindsided jab.  Consider approaching your kid like \"I thought about what you said/asked,\" and offer something like a set time limit on utilities.  \"If you haven't made xyz progress on your business one year from now, THEN you will have to either try my advice with the college classes OR start paying utilities.\"\n\nThat'll be staying your course (again, you're NAH, it seems totally reasonable) AND giving her a fair amount of time to try out her idea, learn a little, and consider her options.  This will help her feel like you are supporting her, even if you aren't giving her what she asked for.  Just having that notice of potential consequence in advance, and having a little room to try and mess up on their own before authority steps in, does a lot to help kids feel heard/respected (especially young adults, who want to be calling the shots) so they'll be much less hostile to your parenting/authority when it comes time to face consequences.", "YTA/NTA\n\nNTA for not giving her the money you saved for education. However, it may cost you the relationship with your child. \n\nI think YTA for asking her to pay living expenses at 18 when she's trying to pursue her dream and start her own business. Especially when not requiring it over the older sibling who is following a life plan you approve of.", "NAH\n\nYou have the right to decline to fund anything you don't want to fund, not funding your daughter's business doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nHowever you do not have the right to decline to fund your daughter's business *and* have her not be upset about it or it be a blow to her relationship with you (hopefully only temporarily). Especially when her sibling already got funding and the money is not in an account officially designated for education only. \n\nIn other words the daughter who wants to start a business knows its only your opinion on her life plan than is preventing her getting funding, not conditions on the account, and its inevitable that would make your refusal hurt more.\n\nEdit:  \n\nAITA seems to decide on a hero and a villian sometimes then absolutely froth at the mouth if anyone does not absolutely hate on the demonised one. Somehow being more angry with NAH or ESH than YTA or NTAs that oppose the narrative.\n\nRead the NTA votes here and most of them are actually NAH that the commenter has labelled NTA instinctively.\n\nI'm not going to change my view because of peer pressure that because we love OP and think he's a hero, that means there must be a villain to hate so who is easiest to paint that way?

She can get a credit card or a business loan to get started (although unlikely any bank will loan her money for this whim obviously but maybe she needs the professionals to explain WHY no one will lend a random inexperienced 18yo money).", "NTA.

The money is for education, not something else.\n\nI'm not saying it's impossible for her to succeed, but if you give her the money now, there's a good chance it will soon be gone without her having something to show for it.\n\nWhen I need a photographer and there's a choice between the 25y/o that actually studied photography and the 18y/o that \"bought a camera\", I know which one I'll choose.\n\nEducation is also an investment.", "NTA.

Running a business is MUCH more than being good at your service/trade/craft/etc. \n\nSecond, in my state, photography was classified as retailing - which means, the photographer has to bill the customer for the appropriate retail sales taxes, then remit that sales tax to the state. If not done properly, a photographer can be on the hook for the sales tax by failing to charge it or failing to charge the correct amount. In my area, that could be as much as 10% of gross, plus penalties and interest. I've personally seen mistakes like that add up to thousands of dollars.

Some bridges/buildings have laws protecting them, meaning pictures can not be taken in front of them and be sold (this is different from taking a selfie/pic for social media because these types would be personal, not for profit pics). Also, some places require permits. Some places do not allow for tripods. The fines for getting caught doing these things (and lawsuits for selling pics with protected buildings/bridges) are NOT cheap.

Restaurants have A LOT of moving parts and they often operate on thin margins, so just one issue can throw their finances out of whack. And in my state at least, restaurants were almost always required to report monthly, which is super frequent, so falling behind just one month causes a domino effect into multiple months, meaning more penalties and interest.\n\nThose are the big three industry-wise - but another common one are people selling crafts or products. It's usually one person selling at craft fairs, farmers markets, and/or online, and they just started doing it without any research.

Was that first thought even close? I never thought I'd work a day in my current profession.  I shook the hand of a Nobel Laureate after getting my diploma in the same subject laughing to myself because I was positive, I was NEVER going to work a day at it. That was 30 years ago.

We also know that they may choose not to go to school and that is a choice we will support. We will not however hand over the money for them to do as they wish with.

Definitely not for a new business with no prior education or training.", "NTA. \n\nIt's great that she has a dream, but she needs a foundation to make it work. \n\nShe will need photography courses. She will need business courses. Save the money until she realizes that.", "So NTA because you have been clear from the start about the use of the money. But I completely, fundamentally disagree with the idea that a \"college fund\" should only be used for education. Not everyone gets or needs higher education to get happy or successful so it does come across as favoritism because you don't approve of their choices.\n\nI'm not advocating for giving an 18 year old a lump sum of cash because that's obviously insane, my plan is to parcel out the funds between 18 and 25 if my kids don't want to use it for school (unless they want a down payment for a house or something). I don't see it as my money because it's always been put aside for them so I don't understand putting a lot of strings on it for them to get access.\n\nMaybe as a compromise you could draw up a contact for a small business loan with better rates than she would get at a bank to help her be successful. Other than that I'd keep offering to pay for business classes like you have.", "INFO:\n\nI'm a pro photographer.\n\nWhat does she know about contracts?\n\nWhat does she know about licensing images?\n\nWhat does she know about advertising her business?\n\nWhat does she know about storyboarding, working with stylists, makeup/hair, magazines, retouchers, etc?\n\nOr does she just think she will buy an expensive camera and ask of a sudden get gigs?\n\nAsk her for her business plan.

Hell, there are online classes that you can purchase for her and she can learn about the business side of photography.", "NTA.\n\nThey know it's for education. However, I think it's worth considerjng non-educational reasons for the money to be given. Eg: (grown) child has a job and savings and wants to merge the education fund to buy their first property.", "NTA. You're right. If you're going to run a business, you really should have an education in the fundamentals of how businesses work and how to work their finances properly, and she should take some courses in professional photography too, so that her business doesn't go bankrupt within a year. She would have a much better chance of being successful after getting a degree, which in addition to the knowledge she would receive, would benefit her in learning self-discipline as well. For her to think that she'll just be successful automatically...shows that she really doesn't know as much as she thinks she does.", "NTA\n\n>She said she doesn't want to go that route because she would rather get her business started right away\n\nHow does she actually plan on being a photographer if she has no intention of learning how to take photographs? Expensive camera equipment will not make her good, especially if she has no idea how to use any of it. Photography is also an art as much as it is a science and people won't be happy if all their wedding photos look like hot garbage.", "NTA\n\n>she knows that money has always been for education, not as a lump sum to be used however she wants. I told her that we will support whatever decision she wants to pursue, but that doesn't mean we have to financially support it.\n\nThat's exactly the situation. She already knew, and you didn't surprise her with this.\n\nLater on, when she decides that she does indeed want to go to college, she will have the means to do so. \n\nYou are being a good parent. It's hard not to give children what they want, but instead to be there for what they need, especially if they disagree. \n\nShe has to be responsible for her choices, and starting a business is hard!", "Has she even shadowed an actual photographer who does it for a living? So many people get these ideas in their head about running a business, but it is HARD work and not for everyone.", "If she wants to run her own business, she needs to take some business classes at minimum. Also, classes in Photoshop/Lightroom would be VERY helpful for her.\n\nAnd then there is the elephant in the room. If she wants to make a living wage taking photos, she needs a solid portfolio taken with professional equipment. My \\*HOBBY\\* gear cost around $1000. People do not want to hire someone that young and pay $5k for their wedding photos. (How much my daughter's wedding photos cost.)", "NTA.  Don't use her education money on this.  She may want it in the future, and be grateful that you saved it for her.\n\nHowever, you let her sister live rent free for two years, and if your other daughter can show commitment and progress on her business you should offer the same deal.  You should insist that she works full time, and treats her business seriously.  That gives her time to get a job and save towards photo equipment, and work on marketing etc. If she isn't working full- time (including the hours she logs on her business) then she needs to pay rent.\n\nYou can establish perimeters: serious businesses have websites, file paperwork to register as a business, make pitches, retain clients, build a portfolio, and pay taxes, etc.\n\nIf she wants to go to school later, hopefully she'll have savings and job experience from this time to help her through it. Don't insist that she goes to school now, it's a waste for people who aren't serious about it.\n\nEdited to say: apprenticeships with professional photogs are a good idea, as is using thumbtack and upwork for finding gigs.  Wedding photography can make decent money if you can show credibility and have good editing skills. Wedding professionals often hire other photographers as a second to get more shots.  It's entirely possible to build a successful photo business out of high school, but it takes a lot of work and commitment.  I love photography, but I freelance as a graphic designer.  I don't freelance as a photographer because it's hard on the body and stressful.  For the right person it's fun and profitable.  When I started freelancing I also worked as a barista, because it pays pretty well, and the hours are super flexible, so I can shift things around for my other work.  \n\nYou need other forms of income if you are a creative freelancer, because there are times when the work is slow, especially in the first few years. If you give her the cash, she won't develop other job skills that will help her out of a jam if it's difficult to find clients.", "A little bit of YTA. You let your oldest live rent free while she was doing her thing, I think you're being an AH from demanding money to live there while she pursues her dream.

I, personally, still haven't touched the money (I am 35) because I know it will come with conditions and that's not fair because my dad shouldn't have a call in it. Either you genuinely want to help your kids or you don't.\n\nIf you ask her to participate financially in the household, whilst she starts a business (and probably whilst she will struggle financially at the beginning) when you are letting the older one get by just because she goes to college, you are inciting them to choose a certain path over another, you are putting conditions on the money. She might see that as a lack of trust, a lack of love. If one of your kids doesn't go to college, it doesn't mean they won't succeed in life, does it?\n\nOn the other side, you are right, starting a business is hard and maybe, you could help her with this by seeking the right advices, professionals with experience, finding an internship etc. I don't know your child: if she did some work experience/shadowing with photographs, if it seems to you that this idea just came out of nowhere... it's natural that you want to make sure her decision isn't rushed. Maybe there could be some compromise here, if she proves to you over a period of time, that she is really into this project and that she is serious about it, you could potentially give her a part of that money. I know it might be an unpopular one, but it's my opinion.", "YTA.   \nYou are playing favourites. Her best option is to leave, and go LC with the people who refuse to help her.", "NTA\n\nYou made it clear it was for education and nothing else. I think it'd make sense to do a business and photography course even if it's CC as that would give her some resources like the equipment she wants but also could lead to her networking with other photographers or business' who can help her in the future. The courses and education wouldn't stop her from starting her business either she can start it along side college and when she's done she can expand it as she'll have more time and knowledge. College may even give her great ideas and incite for the business. If she's worried about marketing a lot of people just make Instagram and tiktok which is a very popular and fruitful way to promote their business what other types of marketing was she looking for that she expects it to cost so much. I do maybe understand her wanting equipment but does she specifically know what equipment she needs for her type of photography or was she just gonna buy anything. Does she already have some equipment or was she planning to buy all brand new. Did she want to rent a studio and again what kind, will she need a dark room or does her photography make her travel. She needs to think a lot and if she comes back with a full blown business plan that you think is well thought out and budgeted maybe then give an allowance from the fund if you think its the right thing to do. But I would hand a lump sum of cash to an 18 year old with no plan.", "NAH, in my opinion! i totally understand where she's coming from\u2014i'm finishing my undergrad and i think about leaving school and trying something else pretty much every day. at the same time, it's a huge risk to do something as big as starting your own business at eighteen. a potential compromise could be that she takes classes part-time and spends the rest of her time working on her photography; there are a ton of magazines and contests that can help her start building a name for herself, if she hasn't been doing that already.", "You might also add that If she gets a business and photography degree she probably would succeed in business.", "Her business idea will just burn money, and she will ask for more. Whether she goes to college or not, she needs experience as an understudy / assistant", "NAH but I think you do owe her other opportunities /ways to support her YTA for dismissing her idea entirely and not supporting her by coming up with ideas at the very least. Why leave her to it alone? \n\n- Why don\u2019t you finance a certification/training in entrepreneurship and photography? \n\nEach separate.\n\n- Preparation: she can then have 3 months rent free time to research and develop her business plan and setup, including the financials needed to startup. Practice her craft. \n\n- Funding: give her six months afterwards to get the financing, still living rent free. And build her portfolio.\n\n- Launch: 6 months to start and earn an income. Rent free.\n\n- Milestones: Have her evaluate her plans and milestones (incl. Financial) see if she\u2019s on track to moving out by X point, or needs to evaluate. She does the assessment with as much or little involvement from you - BUT you could support her in getting a coach to look at it with her and/or mentor/train her.\n\nTo keep it simpler - There are entrepreneurship programs that help through b planning and connecting you to their network for financing. These programs are practical so she\u2019s working on her idea in the process of learning, with peers, she could do it in 6 months within a program (guided) and give her 1-2 years rent free to establish herself after for example. Starting a business needs one year without profit, to break even, at least - rent free for that time at least is fair, I\u2019d say 18-24 months to really help her get to profit.\n\nEntrepreneurs are real, but you are right - her jumping in (influencer) approach (equipment and marketing) won\u2019t account for the stats (startups that didn\u2019t get to the scaling stage - they didn\u2019t fail, 69% of startups would fail but their founders go on to do great things\u2026it\u2019s not a failure in itself, it\u2019s just learned on the job). Her way is not knowledgable and strategic - that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be with the right supporters. 31% of startups succeed, and I honestly don\u2019t think solopreneurships are counted as startups - so the stats are likely not applicable. Market research & feasibility will be part of most entrepreneurship programs.\n\n**TLDR / You can support her in learning this stuff and guide her properly, without directly investing in her business. It\u2019s just a different way to educate herself, more hands on.**", "*She told us she wants to start her own business doing photography.*\n\nOkay- does she have a business plan? Does she have a building, room anything lined up for a studio? What does she know about contracts and negotiations? How is she going to advertise her business and get clients? Will she be working alone or hiring people? What about taxes?\n\nSetting up a business is way harder than it looks. She doesn't seem to have a concrete plan, only that the education fund will some how enable her to have a successful business. Has she spoken to any photographers to know the details of their business? Has she worked with any photographers to know that it's hard drumming up business in an era where everyone has a cellphone that can take amazing shots? Is she hoping that if she fails at this, you'll feel sorry enough to give her more money for an education?\n\nThe money is to be used for educational purposes. You are right to suggest that she take some business courses so that she will be better prepared if she does want to run her own business. There are lots of pitfalls that she is unaware of and she may realize that it is harder than she thought.", "NTA, and stick to this.

There\u2019s networking. There\u2019s having spent 4 years pursuing a single goal successfully. Theres 4 years living out of the house with a net under her. There\u2019s a reason why jobs pay more for folks with college degrees and it\u2019s not just the training.
