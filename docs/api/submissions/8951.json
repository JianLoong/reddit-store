Would you financially support her if she took photography and business courses?", "NTA. Starting your own business at 18 with no real training or even business classes is a recipe for disaster. Perhaps there's a compromise to be reached here where she needs to work for x number of years with a professional photographer and learn from them. After that, if she presents you with a solid business model, complete with expenses and it's well thought out, then maybe you'd consider using your fund for her business, but just giving her that money now, straight out of high school would be a colossal mistake because this money was intended to set her out on a great start in life and this won't do that.", "NTA I think your offer for photography and business courses is amazing! It is a flooded industry and she needs to learn how to stand out! She wants to be an adult and start a business instantly without learning the ins and outs of running a business. She may be about to find out how tough it really is. It is your money and you decide how it is spent.", "NTA Starting a business sounds easy, but is not. Ask her for her businessplan, that will force her to think about her business and it will tell you whether she's got a good head for it. Then you could always consider to invest in her business. I think your way of going to college and learn about setting up a business and photography is smarter, but that apparently is not her path yet. Giving her money for setting up the business is most likely wasting it...", "NTA. I own a business and my advice to her would be to get a business degree, even an associates. Or you might also be willing to pay for her for a certificate or general business training. I'd love to be able to do that. \n\nEither way NTA. Realistically very few people will have a photography business that supports them entirely, so personally I'd keep that money aside for if she realizes she does want/need a career education.", "NTA what she is asking is extremely risky on all fronts. The money is for education not for starting a business. There's no favorites being shown. IF You gave her the money for another reason other than school it could be argued you were playing favorites with her allowing it to be used for unintended purposes.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA. Your daughter knew her entire life that money was for educational purposes. So you\u2019re well within your right to refuse her, and offering up the classes in her area of interest was a great compromise. If I wanted to start my own business, business classes would be the first thing I\u2019d look into. She\u2019s eager to be an adult, I get it. But starting a business is hard and running a successful business is even harder, so I feel like you\u2019re doing the right thing by sticking to your original stipulations and only using that money for furthering education.", "NTA. Photography business? You mean the thing anybody can do with their iPhones these days? I\u2019m 20 and most friends I know that wanted to do photography professionally in high school now do it as a hobby and to build a portfolio, and have been doing it for years. They still can\u2019t convince people they know to pay for their services. There\u2019s only certain occasions someone hires a photographer (weddings, big events) and they expect them to show up with the best equipment and to edit the photos afterwards professionally. If she doesn\u2019t want to be stuck taking passport photos, her best bet is to find something else she\u2019s passionate about. Tell her that not every hobby needs to turn into a profession. Also, if she\u2019s adamant that she knows how to run a business, tell her to prepare a business plan for you. After all, it\u2019s an investment and that\u2019s how it\u2019s done. Make sure there\u2019s a competitor analysis in there as well. With any luck, she\u2019ll realize she has no idea what she\u2019s doing by the end of it.", "NTA. My older brother, while working a full-time job, is an extremely gifted photographer. He's traveled all over the world to capture truly amazing moments. He's promoted his photography to ad nauseum with very little reward. He received endless kudos, but not much of a bite by way of compensation. Your advice to your daughter is spot on to get an associates degree in business and photography. Have her visit an accomplished photographer or studio to get an idea of how hard that road is.  Stand your ground.", "NTA, but you should save that money for when your daughter wants to continue her education. Photography only worked for Brooklyn Beckham, and only for a short while. But that's only because he's already rich.", "NTA. I would advice your middle child to take some sorry of classes in photography and business so she has some knowledge. And those classes you can provide uses the money that you saved up. You have a reason to set aside money for a particular reason and that is education. That money was not meant for a start up.", "NTA; your daughter that wants to start a photography business doesn\u2019t even know \u201cwhat she doesn\u2019t know yet\u201d and even a certificate in entrepreneurship or small business would be useful.  It\u2019s not all unicorns and rainbows. If she is too foolish to take you up on the generous offer use the money for your own education; it\u2019s never too late.", "NTA. It\u2019s a parent\u2019s job to encourage their child to be as successful as they can. You\u2019re right in saying people with experience start a business and fail. Nearly half of all new businesses fail in the first 5 years. What happens 5 years down the road if her business isn\u2019t a success? What will she have to fall back on? \n\nYou\u2019re not playing favorites; you\u2019re giving her a reasonable dose of reality that all parents should AND providing her with a very reasonable alternative.", "NTA. Your suggestion is reasonable, and it's your right to use the money however you want. She knew the rules when she decided to skip education altogether.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give her the education fund for purposes other than education. She should understand what it was for and, if you give in to her requests, you *would* actually be playing favorites. She should be mature enough to understand that if she\u2019s planning on owning a business by herself. However, I\u2019m not sure why you are planning to start charging rent if she decides to work instead of study? Is there a time limit for other siblings?", "NTA- suggesting doing business classes is a smart thing and would help her know what to do.\n\nIf the money has always been ear marked for college/education then tell her that if in a year if she wants to do the classes for photography or business then she can.", "NTA.  As someone married to a photographer, it is not easy to get that business off the ground.  Since daughter is so young and likely has no clue about starting a business, I would encourage her to take at least some sort of photography, business, SEO, and/or web page design classes.  Professional equipment is indeed expensive, but you also have to worry about branding, being seen, the local competition, contracts, and how to manage and maintain business functionality and finance.  Not saying she's incapable of these things, but it's not as easy as buying equipment.  Especially if she intends to make this a career.\n\nInfo: OP is the money available for one-off classes that aren't necessarily part of a degree or 2-4 year program?", "NTA, I am someone who went to college for photography, but only got an associates due to my Community College not offering bachelors degrees, and I am STILL having a hard time getting my business going because I feel like there is so much more I should've learned. Yes it is very easy to be comfortable using a camera. But owning a photography business is more than just snapping a shutter, applying some edits, and sending it on its way. She needs to understand how to use studio lighting systems, lighting from various angles, appropriate methods and styles of posing models, and most importantly of all: how to actually run and manage a business's financials and the legalities that are involved with taking people's photos.", "NTA \n\nRunning a photography business is constant stress and she has no clue of what it will feel like after a few years. She would be waaaaaay better off earning a degree that gets her job security while she does a photography side hustle. Feel free to pass this on. Love, Another Wedding Photographer", "NTA. You dont just pick up a camera and call your self a photographer you offered a fair middle ground. In between classes she could work on building a portfolio as an amateur photographer and building a following on social media.", "NTA. It's your money. You made stipulations for its use and you're sticking to it. You're right that she should take courses first. And maybe she'll figure that out when she tries to take out a small business loan and has to give them her business plan. Right now she just doesn't want to put the work in. Expecting the instant gratification. And that's not likely to work", "NAH. She\u2019s not an A but it does sound like she may need further parenting then a yes/no on financing.\n\nDoes she have a business plan? Does she know how to make one?

What kind of photography is she pursuing?

If she needs more knowledge to start (the most likely scenario) help her research business and photography programs that would help.\n\nI would also go through the curriculums of her accepted colleges. There\u2019s likely pathways there that would benefit her that she hasn\u2019t discovered. \n\nYou can keeps this as a yes/no question, but I think the better thing to do is work *with* her.", "NTA.  She wants to start a business doing photography without any photography or business training...has she interned with anyone who is a photographer?  does she know she will need to do quarterly taxes and how much she needs to set aside for this?  what camera does she have and will it take the quality of pictures she needs to be able to take?  what editing software does she already have and how good is she at using it?\n\nTell her for each semester of community college she takes you get her something towards her business for her to start training with...software, camera, intro meeting with an accountant and or business consultant.", "NTA but ask your daughter to produce a business plan on how she plans to move forward,  costings, marketing, equipment, premises,  insurance , etc and make a more informed decision then. I understand and admire her desire and enthusiasm but it takes more than that to establish a successful business .", "Nta\n\nShe can certainly start a photography business whilst doing higher education.  \n\nThat said it is worth evaluating if there's a reason your daughter feels that you don't value her as much and favor her other sibling.  It may be worth doing family counseling with her to get a clearer picture of her grievances and learn how you can show her respect and build a healthier relationship with her.", "NTA, but i. Saying that some people are not meant to go to college. Some find school to be stifling and just need to get out into the world.", "So she has to continu studying to keep free housing and board. Did they know this too? Or did you just add this on? INFO", "NTA - Tell her you WILL help with photography and business courses, because those will help her in her chosen field.", "NTA\n\nIt's your money and you've been clear that it's for education. I will say, there are options here that I think would maybe result in less animosity. \n\nAsk your daughter to present you with a full business plan. Just like she would have to if she wanted a bank loan to start the business. She doesn't have to start college for several months now. For now, she can enroll in one of the colleges that accepted her and she has until X date to present her business plan to you. She'll have to include the works: market analysis, plans for marketing, pricing plans, forecasts of her breakeven point, short and long-term budgets, etc. \n\nThen if you know anyone who either has a similar freelance type business or who works with bank loans or if you can find a professional photographer who is willing to let you pay them to asses your daughter's proposal, you can review it along with that person.\n\nOne of two things will happen. Either your daughter actually has this all really well planned out and somehow has the business acumen to know how to plan a business successfully and financially responsibly. In which case I think it would only be fair to give her the money or at least give it to her as a 0% interest loan. Or she'll fall short and you can show her where she still needs to learn and explain what educational coursework would help her build a sounder foundation for her business after she's done with school.", "NTA\n\n Being young and wanting to tackle the world after graduation is a real thing. This comes from lack of experience and grand ideas. Eventually life has a way of humbling us really quick with reality. \n\nHold firm on the money being used for education. She is looking for the quick shortcut to her dream and not realizing that her dream needs education. Running a business is no easy task. Many fail within a few years. People dump loads of money into it for it to fail and cost them greatly. The competition in photography is massive. Going in with no clue on the things involved in running/owning a business is never good. It's more than marketing and equipment. It's insurance, contracts, payments, taxes, overhead cost, liability, etc. Those are just a few things out of the many things involved in owning a business.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter really should accept the education offer and start her business as a side hustle.", "NAH, at 18, still in high school, she does not have a clue about running a business.  Also, I doubt many people would trust an 18 y/o to take pictures for once in a lifetime events (weddings and Baptisms spring to mind).  However, if she agrees to work with an experienced photographer for an agreed upon amount of time or take business classes and can set out a plan, I would agree to help with basic necessities such as a second camera, lenses etc. to start as a working photographer while taking classes or workin with an experienced photographer. I think it\u2019s about working within the spirit of the agreement rather than a flat \u201cno\u201d.   I also think that college degrees are not the be all/end all accomplishment they used to be.  Talent and creativity cant be taught . Business skills can be taught and there is way more to learn about starting a business than simply being a talented photographer.", "NTA; suggestion from another parent of a daughter who has the same idea, I told her we will help out once she\u2019s completed some formal business courses and a proper photography class at the county college. If she make it through and puts the work we are going to help w/ camera lenses and website. Best of luck", "NTA. If I had a dollar for every \"photography business\" being advertised in local pages, I'd be able to quit my own job. Your daughter needs training to be able to run a business successfully. Whether that's to intern and work for an established professional, or to go to school. You are approaching this like any investment you have saved money for. You are willing to invest in setting her up long-term for her future. If she was serious about this business, she would be taking the needed steps to do it well. If she went to a bank for a business loan with this plan of hers, they would laugh her out of the office. Her proposal to you is no different. It's a bad risk, plain and simple.", "NTA. I know a lot of incredibly talented professional photographers, and most of them still have some kind of day job. One wedding photographer I know - who has been doing this for 20 years - does it full time, but she\u2019s been featured in a ton of national publications and she\u2019s highly sought after. \n\nAn 18 year old starting a photography business is fine, but she needs to do something else to make a living while she tries to build a business. I see so many young women on FB starting photo businesses. Their work is mediocre and they charge next to nothing just to get clients. But most are SAHM\u2019s and they don\u2019t really need the money, so that\u2019s fine for them. But it\u2019s not practical for someone who wants to build a legit career.", "NTA, and I like your approach to funding education - the money doesn't belong to the kids, it belongs to you and your wife, but you are willing to put it towards specific things (education, in this instance).   At the same time, you're not forcing your kids to follow a specific path. \n\nOne thing that you might want to consider - but only if you're genuinely serious about it -  is treating your 18 year old's idea in a strictly-business manner. Have her put together a business plan and present it to you. She needs to be able to come up with an exact amount of money she will need (and from what sources - you, herself, small business loans? any other contacts?), how she will use that money (a studio? advertising? transportation to/from gigs? equipment? assistants/staff?), and how she's going to treat this - is it supposed to be a gift with no strings? a loan? and investment/ownership share of her business?\n\nI'm just guessing here, but I'm guessing she's pretty good at it and passionate about it, but is underestimating what it takes to really run a business. It's hard - it's not just showing up and taking photos.  Your advice to attend at least a community college with some business courses is fantastic, but she might not be ready to hear it yet. Maybe make that a condition? Can she part-time her photography as a side business and take classes part time while living at home?\n\nAgain, don't have her develop a business plan unless you are going to honestly listen to her ideas and would genuinely be willing to contribute if she has her stuff together - it would be awful to do that and pull the rug out after. Just a thought to consider.", "NAH, why can't she do both? Why can't she go ahead and start her business and still go to classes? I think it's a great plan to take photography classes and business classes, but there's no reason why she can't go ahead and start it up. She won't be making much money doing it, but working towards her goals on the weekends and evenings isn't a bad thing at all and she'll be gaining experience along the way.", "I\u2019m going NAH at this point. I can see how, from her perspective, she\u2019s not just asking for a check to run off and have fun, she has specific business ambitions and sees the assistance received by her sibling. On the other, I see your point and valuing education.  \n\nOne thought: Perhaps ask her for a full write-up. A business plan, projected budget, expected income, marketing plan, the whole nine yards. If she can produce all that, maybe she\u2019s ready. If not, well, maybe it will help her see why she needs business classes.", "NAH, it sounds like you made the rules clear, and they sound completely reasonable.\n\nIt may be worth it to walk back your position a bit just so the kid feels heard and views you as fair- within reason.  Can't let the point of your position be lost.\n\nI'd say that making the kid pay utilities on top of not offering the business support is what's making them feel targetted.  It's not an unreasonable idea, but it wasn't (as far as I can tell) part of the initial deal, so it feels like a blindsided jab.  Consider approaching your kid like \"I thought about what you said/asked,\" and offer something like a set time limit on utilities.  \"If you haven't made xyz progress on your business one year from now, THEN you will have to either try my advice with the college classes OR start paying utilities.\"\n\nThat'll be staying your course (again, you're NAH, it seems totally reasonable) AND giving her a fair amount of time to try out her idea, learn a little, and consider her options.  This will help her feel like you are supporting her, even if you aren't giving her what she asked for.  Just having that notice of potential consequence in advance, and having a little room to try and mess up on their own before authority steps in, does a lot to help kids feel heard/respected (especially young adults, who want to be calling the shots) so they'll be much less hostile to your parenting/authority when it comes time to face consequences.", "YTA/NTA\n\nNTA for not giving her the money you saved for education. However, it may cost you the relationship with your child. \n\nI think YTA for asking her to pay living expenses at 18 when she's trying to pursue her dream and start her own business. Especially when not requiring it over the older sibling who is following a life plan you approve of.", "NAH\n\nYou have the right to decline to fund anything you don't want to fund, not funding your daughter's business doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nHowever you do not have the right to decline to fund your daughter's business *and* have her not be upset about it or it be a blow to her relationship with you (hopefully only temporarily). Especially when her sibling already got funding and the money is not in an account officially designated for education only. \n\nIn other words the daughter who wants to start a business knows its only your opinion on her life plan than is preventing her getting funding, not conditions on the account, and its inevitable that would make your refusal hurt more.\n\nEdit: lol I nearly included that this would get downvotes but decided not to be so pessimistic. \n\nAITA seems to decide on a hero and a villian sometimes then absolutely froth at the mouth if anyone does not absolutely hate on the demonised one. Somehow being more angry with NAH or ESH than YTA or NTAs that oppose the narrative.\n\nRead the NTA votes here and most of them are actually NAH that the commenter has labelled NTA instinctively.\n\nI'm not going to change my view because of peer pressure that because we love OP and think he's a hero, that means there must be a villain to hate so who is easiest to paint that way?
