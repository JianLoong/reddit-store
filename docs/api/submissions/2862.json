He said he rarely ever gets to do what he wants and so I didn't want to judge him since it's his money eventually.\n\n\nWe discussed plans for christmas and he told me to handle everything since he won't be back til Dec. 20th. He told me he had put aside money for christmas decoration, food, gifts, kids needs etc. The money in total was 100$. I was completely shocked I told him 100$ for an entire family's christmas celebration was ridiculously not enough. He shrugged saying it's all he's got but I pointed out how he's paying for his friend's and his girlfriend's travel expenses. He told me to just \"take it\" but I said that if he decided to leave me with just 100 bucks then I won't be doing anything for christmas. We had lots of arguments and couldn't get this resolved.\n\n\n\nHe's in Qatar now (he left days ago). Yesterday, while I was cleaning I found an envelope with the same 100$ and a note from him telling me \"to make it work\". I sent him a message that I've decided that I won't be doing anything for christmas with this little money, period. He was livid he just kept sending an angry message after another calling me \"spoiled\" and telling me to stop expecting to live like I was still living in my parents house and to stop trying to \"rob\" the kids of enjoying the holidays like the other kids.\n\n\nI haven't replied but he's livid saying I'm punishing him for going and trying to guilt him using his own money.", "created_utc": 1669029760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0wjz0/aita_for_not_doing_anything_for_christmas_this/", "score": 4249, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Realize that shit is not free, I bet he\u2019ll change his tune real quick. I agree with the comment saying you should have Christmas with your kids at your parents and just exclude husband, and really consider leaving him cuz that\u2019s financially abusive. The note with the 100 bucks would\u2019ve sent me over the edge, what a complete ass\u2026", "NTA.    I'd be having Christmas  for my kids....at my parents house.\n\nIt's  his money???

Paid for his friend and his friends gf even though point 1 exists.\n\n3. Expects you to plan, cater and buy Christmas decorations etc with $100 and just deal with it. \n\n4. Is gaslighting you and blaming you for his selfish actions/choices. \n\n5. It is not HIS money. It is FAMILY money. Im sure if you worked and pulled a stunt like this he would be more that pissed. \n\n6. Use the $100 to get a locksmith. He doesn't value you and your contributions to the family, nor your 3 kids. The world cup isn't more important than your family. Its literally televised. There is no real reason to go!\n\nNTA. Tbh if someone showed me and our kids this much disrespect the only thing they'd be getting is separation/divorce papers.\n\nETA INFO: something that just popped into my head... has he left you any money/cards aside from the $100? If not you need to leave ASAP.", "NTA and look up \"financial abuse.\"\n\nMy wife is SAHM so mine is the only income.

If it doesn't help OP maybe it will jostle somebody else into thinking about \"the unthinkable\":\n\nMy household is one income and we make sure that SAHM has a full credit report / rating even without income, _just in case_. Her car and its loan _is 100% in her name_.

He is financially responsible for you and the kids before himself. He signed up for that when he married you. A sahm is a 24 hour job. He\u2019s gone for what, a whole month?!

You are NTA and I would be livid if my husband just left me with 3 kids for that long. And he is also paying for his friends expenses??? He is putting his friends before his family, which is not ok.

Do you have idea what it would cost to pay someone to do everything you do? \n\nHe is the one blowing a fortune on himself and his friends, so he is the one robbing his children of Christmas presents.

Sure as shit not with his wife and kids. I\u2019m sorry, OP. Best Christmas wishes!", "NTA...take the hundred bucks and leave. This sounds awful.", "NTA.   There are deep deep problems with your relationship and his treatment of you and your children.", "I am confused on how he thinks it is ok to pay for a friend and the friend's girlfriend to go and not leave enough money for Christmas? Also leaving for a month is also pretty crappy when you have 3 kids. My ex husband did this to me a lot. When my 2nd child was 3 months old I left. This is abuse. NTA", "NTA. The audacity to tell you to do whatever with 100$ and then take tickets for his friend and his gf???? Leave him. You're not his priority", "NTA.   Not being able to buy any beer at the stadium has brought out his inner scrooge.", "NTA sounds like financial abuse or the start of it. You deserve to be treated like an equal. You are raising the kids, that is your job and his is out the home, both are valuable and you both are adding value to the relationship. That money is both of yours and no one person should get to determine how the bulk is spent leaving one of you without and struggling to make do and then being verbally abused when his expectations aren\u2019t met.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a healthy relationship. Its financial abuse, it\u2019s emotionally controlling and it has the potential to be full abuse if it\u2019s not already.\n\nIdk if you need to hear this, my mother did. A man does not need to hit you to be abusing you. Control is a form of abuse, financial control and manipulation is a form of abuse and it can sneak up slowly over time so you don\u2019t know.\n\nThen when you question them, they throw it back at you and you somehow end up on the defensive or being blamed. For example he blamed you for robbing the kids of Christmas when the original question was about the money he was using.\n\nYou do not have to stay for your kids, they will be better with a happy mother. You don\u2019t have to do it alone there is so much help out there and financial aide.\n\nI could be way off base but on the off chance that I am not I needed to say something", "NTA - and your financial situation\u2026 aka you and your children living at his whim and ego is grounds for leaving him. I would never allow my significant other to control me so much. You deserve better. My mom left with three children when we were 7yo, you can do it too.", "NTA he\u2019s being financially abusive. Take this time while he\u2019s out to find a place for you and your kids to live.", "NTA, but you will be if you stay. A marriage is a partnership of values, love, resources, and responsibility. None of that is evident in your message so the best Xmas gift you can give your family is to leave him", "NTA.

Like starting as soon as the kids don't go to school for winter break.\n\nYou're NTA, but you would be if you let your kids go without Christmas, with you and your husband fighting. You would also be the asshole if you don't start planning for a divorce. A guy who leaves 100 dollars for Christmas while he goes to enjoy a stupid sport event and paid for his friend and GF to go doesn't deserve you or your kids. \n\nI don't know you but I'm sure you can do a thousand times better than this loser.", "NTA for being mad at him, but please do something for your kids sake.

Why must he pay for his friend and their girlfriend if it means he cannot afford to provide properly for his family?? This sounds really f***Ed up. And also: it is not his money.

If you change your mind this is an exceptional circumstance that will help you with custody. \n\nPlease prepare for the worst, even if nothing comes of this and you try to move on. Just make sure it's backed up somewhere he can't delete it- and do NOT tell him about it. Physical copies stored at someone else's house (that you trust to keep your confidence) is a really good idea too. \n\nI also urge you to not be home when he gets back. Go to a relatives house if possible, someone who won't let him in if he shows up. Do Christmas there. I'm genuinely worried about your safety because of how outrageous this situation is. He made an impossible task for you, and will be stewing about your failing to complete it the entire month he is gone. \n\nBeyond all this, it may be smart to just make a budgeted list of what you would need to spend money on if you DID do Christmas, even for the basics. Make it detailed. Leave it for him. Maybe he will come around and realize what a piece of stuff he is for doing this to you and your kids, and come groveling. I don't think so, but that's the effort I would suggest if this is super abnormal and maybe he's just been a compete moron. I don't think it will matter cause he seems to be an irrational jerkwad, but maybe you will think it's worth a shot. \n\nI wish you well. Take care of yourself.", "NTA: he cancelled Christmas.

I recall grocery shopping costing me about 100 for those parties then.", "Also,  many States/cities have attorneys that work with DV organizations who work Pro Bono!!\nGet in touch with your locals! Use that $100. for gas, (and initial babysitter) if need be! Pick up some Door Dash/UberEATS shifts! Usually won't need babysitter at DV office, they have someone to watch them. Good luck OP, don't let yourself and kids down by not following thru with some of these suggestions. You do qualify for at minimum,  some help.", "This is where my thoughts went", "Lawyers don\u2019t take divorce cases pro-bono. Depending on the state it could cost anywhere from $500 to 5k. \n\nSource: I divorced an abuser and had mountains of evidence.", "Or free. My cleaning lady knows a married couple, both lawyers, that take on free work for those who can't afford it because they make so much money with other clients that they can afford to do so. If op lives in GA, I'd totally see if I can help their info", "This without a doubt monetary maltreatment. Final proposal time without a doubt.", "Hopefully her parents can help make up for it. Presents are just one aspect of Christmas for kids. Activities and ritual are a big part of it and often there are a lot of free events to go to. Being excited with the kids and actively participating with them will make more memories than dad's money would have.", "Yeah a nice fake tree can cost anything between 200-1000. My fake tree cost \u00a310 on sale but it's not a very nice one - enough for me though.", "True. It'd be very difficult with three kids.", "This guy can\u2019t afford to give his family more than $100 for Christmas but is staying for the entire World Cup. Not just a game or two - the whole thing. In a place where renting out a shipping container room is about $125 a night.\n\nI don\u2019t buy this at all, but if it is true then OP needs to get out now. This dude isn\u2019t playing it straight with her at all.", "We spent that much yesterday on just the basics for thanksgiving (I\u2019m American) on Thursday and all we got were like the odds and ends the yams I didn\u2019t cream of mushroom for green beans casserole. Just the little stuff. And I\u2019m on disability and snap but with the way inflation is going right now our cost of living is high as well. But I know it\u2019s worse other places so I\u2019m not complaining I\u2019m just saying I couldn\u2019t even make a nice dinner for three people on 100 bucks even with the turkey being given to me. Oh and my snap was already used for day to day like milk and bread", "I agree with your sentiment but would hesitate unless the family is earning significantly, as the income would be taxed twice - once on the original income and again on the LLC\u2019s income. Fiscally not worth it, although psychologically yes.", "HA", "For the win!", "I was thinking bare tree, not tinsel and lights and such :)  I distinctly remember paying $20 for a scraggly pine.", "It's a hard situation to realize that yes you and kiddos are being abused and no physical bruises that show. Think back for all the times he deprived y'all. As a SAHP you EARN half his salary by keeping your home working!!", "Hopefully she can save enough for a retainer. It'll be hard since she'll have to do it in secret, but husband is also gone til Dec 20 so she has a month to find a way to get this money. I believe in her! Also, good for you for leaving your abuser.", "That\u2019s not necessarily true. I personally know someone whose divorce lawyer did end up doing it for free. However, that was after the abusive ex decided to attack said lawyer and caused the lawyer to hate/hold a massive grudge against the abusive ex. \n\nLife is weirder than fiction with some people just stupid enough to try and jump a lawyer in a dark parking lot. I mean, why would anyone attack a *lawyer*? That\u2019s like deciding to attack all the bureaucracy of the legal system itself.", "Some lawyers will work with you on a payment plan, though.", "This isn\u2019t entirely true. There are several orgs in my state that do pro Bono divorce work. It is also entirely possible to get divorced without an attorney. No one should remain married because they are afraid they can\u2019t pay an attorney.", "I\u2019m sorry that was your experience but I work in social work/public health and it really does depend where you look. There are a lot of family lawyers and organizations especially with domestic violence that do just that. Does it often take a long time to look and find someone on top of work and taking care of kids? Absolutely but there\u2019s hope and there are resources out there if you look", "Agreed. We do a huge potluck Thanksgiving dinner with my side of the family each year with 20+ people. My household is responsible for 2 sides this year (gluten free) so that there's food everyone can have. The ingredients for enough food  for just my 2 dishes were over $50. Much less a turkey or all of the pie ingredients or premade pies.", "(Laughs quietly in historical literature)", "She should go looking around the house for the financial information, if she doesn\u2019t have it. Guy sounds like the kind to pull everything out of the bank if she serves him divorce papers.  \n\nThe part about the bf and his gf particularly galls me. What a utter A H husband is, spending his and Op\u2019s money on his friends over family. \n\nOp, NTA. Please reconsider your marriage. I hope you don\u2019t live like this any longer and find a way out.", "She has a car and a month. Doordash 100 a night will add up real quick. I\u2019ve been in weird situations but if I were her, I\u2019d definitely be saving and doing what I needed to get out. Geez. Wants to impress his friends and look like the big guy on campus. No way you deserve so much better. The kids too. Who\u2019s gone for football that long?!!?? With people not my family during the holiday season?!", "I\u2019m not a fan of the go fund me thing but this seems like a really good time for that. Post about husband paying to take him and 2 other people overseas for a football event while leaving her with $100 total for Christmas and told to make it work.\n\n*I don\u2019t mean raise the money for the holiday- I mean start a go fund me to pay for divorce proceedings.*\n\nOp doesn\u2019t need help to \u2018make this work\u2019 she needs help to get out of a finically abusive relationship.\n\nNTA- but really look at your relationship and you and your children\u2019s lives and ask if this is really acceptable. If there is one person working to support the household the money is not his money- it\u2019s the families money.", "Haha said like someone without kids. What\u2019s she doing with the kids while door dashing?", "Abusive assholes, that's who! You're right, she can get that money if she gets a babysitter for a few hours a few times a week.", "That\u2019s why I said a chat with mom and dad might be sufficient. I said it in a different response. Doordash and kids, yeah no. My niece falls asleep any my nephew wants to talk to everyone and then I end up talking to everyone too!", "I think a chat with mom and dad might be in order."]}
