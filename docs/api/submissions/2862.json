He said he rarely ever gets to do what he wants and so I didn't want to judge him since it's his money eventually.\n\n\nWe discussed plans for christmas and he told me to handle everything since he won't be back til Dec. 20th. He told me he had put aside money for christmas decoration, food, gifts, kids needs etc. The money in total was 100$. I was completely shocked I told him 100$ for an entire family's christmas celebration was ridiculously not enough. He shrugged saying it's all he's got but I pointed out how he's paying for his friend's and his girlfriend's travel expenses. He told me to just \"take it\" but I said that if he decided to leave me with just 100 bucks then I won't be doing anything for christmas. We had lots of arguments and couldn't get this resolved.\n\n\n\nHe's in Qatar now (he left days ago). Yesterday, while I was cleaning I found an envelope with the same 100$ and a note from him telling me \"to make it work\". I sent him a message that I've decided that I won't be doing anything for christmas with this little money, period. He was livid he just kept sending an angry message after another calling me \"spoiled\" and telling me to stop expecting to live like I was still living in my parents house and to stop trying to \"rob\" the kids of enjoying the holidays like the other kids.\n\n\nI haven't replied but he's livid saying I'm punishing him for going and trying to guilt him using his own money.", "created_utc": 1669029760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0wjz0/aita_for_not_doing_anything_for_christmas_this/", "score": 15652, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Realize that shit is not free, I bet he\u2019ll change his tune real quick. I agree with the comment saying you should have Christmas with your kids at your parents and just exclude husband, and really consider leaving him cuz that\u2019s financially abusive. The note with the 100 bucks would\u2019ve sent me over the edge, what a complete ass\u2026", "NTA.    I'd be having Christmas  for my kids....at my parents house.\n\nIt's  his money???

Why is it 'his' money when you are in charge of household admin and childcare while he waltzes off with his friends to pay thousands to watch a bunch of overpaid eejuts kick a ball around a stadium built on eco destruction and human rights violations? \nNo sane person from this century could pull of Christmas with 100bucks unless they go in for petty theft on a grand scale. \nUltimatum time, he treats you as an equal financially or you leave and get child support.", "NTA\n\nAs has been pointed out, this is called financial abuse.

Paid for his friend and his friends gf even though point 1 exists.\n\n3. Expects you to plan, cater and buy Christmas decorations etc with $100 and just deal with it. \n\n4. Is gaslighting you and blaming you for his selfish actions/choices. \n\n5. It is not HIS money. It is FAMILY money. Im sure if you worked and pulled a stunt like this he would be more that pissed. \n\n6. Use the $100 to get a locksmith. He doesn't value you and your contributions to the family, nor your 3 kids. The world cup isn't more important than your family. Its literally televised. There is no real reason to go!\n\nNTA. Tbh if someone showed me and our kids this much disrespect the only thing they'd be getting is separation/divorce papers.\n\nETA INFO: something that just popped into my head... has he left you any money/cards aside from the $100? If not you need to leave ASAP.", "NTA and look up \"financial abuse.\"\n\nMy wife is SAHM so mine is the only income. Anything over like $200 is a discussion about _our_ money and _our_ family.\n\nI won't even get into the CF that is the whole World Cup thing.\n\n----\n\nEdit: Assuming this is real, this answer has blown up, so I'll copy/paste a comment I made on a similar post previously. If it doesn't help OP maybe it will jostle somebody else into thinking about \"the unthinkable\":\n\nMy household is one income and we make sure that SAHM has a full credit report / rating even without income, _just in case_. Her car and its loan _is 100% in her name_. My name isn't on any paperwork; in fact my credit report was locked so the stealership wouldn't even take a joint check as a down payment because they \"didn't trust me.\" \ud83d\ude02\n\nThis is something that was driven into my head by my mother, who did home health care for a bunch of elderly women who outlived their husbands by decades and were legally only ever \"just\" Mrs. So-and-so with not a damned thing in their own name.

He is financially responsible for you and the kids before himself. He signed up for that when he married you. A sahm is a 24 hour job. He\u2019s gone for what, a whole month?!

You are NTA and I would be livid if my husband just left me with 3 kids for that long. And he is also paying for his friends expenses??? He is putting his friends before his family, which is not ok.

Do you have idea what it would cost to pay someone to do everything you do? \n\nHe is the one blowing a fortune on himself and his friends, so he is the one robbing his children of Christmas presents.

Sure as shit not with his wife and kids. I\u2019m sorry, OP. Best Christmas wishes!", "NTA...take the hundred bucks and leave. This sounds awful.", "NTA.   There are deep deep problems with your relationship and his treatment of you and your children.", "I am confused on how he thinks it is ok to pay for a friend and the friend's girlfriend to go and not leave enough money for Christmas? Also leaving for a month is also pretty crappy when you have 3 kids. My ex husband did this to me a lot. When my 2nd child was 3 months old I left. This is abuse. NTA", "NTA. The audacity to tell you to do whatever with 100$ and then take tickets for his friend and his gf???? Leave him. You're not his priority", "NTA.   Not being able to buy any beer at the stadium has brought out his inner scrooge.", "NTA sounds like financial abuse or the start of it. You deserve to be treated like an equal. You are raising the kids, that is your job and his is out the home, both are valuable and you both are adding value to the relationship. That money is both of yours and no one person should get to determine how the bulk is spent leaving one of you without and struggling to make do and then being verbally abused when his expectations aren\u2019t met.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a healthy relationship. Its financial abuse, it\u2019s emotionally controlling and it has the potential to be full abuse if it\u2019s not already.\n\nIdk if you need to hear this, my mother did. A man does not need to hit you to be abusing you. Control is a form of abuse, financial control and manipulation is a form of abuse and it can sneak up slowly over time so you don\u2019t know.\n\nThen when you question them, they throw it back at you and you somehow end up on the defensive or being blamed. For example he blamed you for robbing the kids of Christmas when the original question was about the money he was using.\n\nYou do not have to stay for your kids, they will be better with a happy mother. You don\u2019t have to do it alone there is so much help out there and financial aide.\n\nI could be way off base but on the off chance that I am not I needed to say something", "NTA - and your financial situation\u2026 aka you and your children living at his whim and ego is grounds for leaving him. I would never allow my significant other to control me so much. You deserve better. My mom left with three children when we were 7yo, you can do it too.", "NTA he\u2019s being financially abusive. Take this time while he\u2019s out to find a place for you and your kids to live.", "NTA, but you will be if you stay. A marriage is a partnership of values, love, resources, and responsibility. None of that is evident in your message so the best Xmas gift you can give your family is to leave him", "NTA.

Like starting as soon as the kids don't go to school for winter break.\n\nYou're NTA, but you would be if you let your kids go without Christmas, with you and your husband fighting. You would also be the asshole if you don't start planning for a divorce. A guy who leaves 100 dollars for Christmas while he goes to enjoy a stupid sport event and paid for his friend and GF to go doesn't deserve you or your kids. \n\nI don't know you but I'm sure you can do a thousand times better than this loser.", "NTA for being mad at him, but please do something for your kids sake.

Why must he pay for his friend and their girlfriend if it means he cannot afford to provide properly for his family?? This sounds really f***Ed up. And also: it is not his money.

If you change your mind this is an exceptional circumstance that will help you with custody. \n\nPlease prepare for the worst, even if nothing comes of this and you try to move on. Just make sure it's backed up somewhere he can't delete it- and do NOT tell him about it. Physical copies stored at someone else's house (that you trust to keep your confidence) is a really good idea too. \n\nI also urge you to not be home when he gets back. Go to a relatives house if possible, someone who won't let him in if he shows up. Do Christmas there. I'm genuinely worried about your safety because of how outrageous this situation is. He made an impossible task for you, and will be stewing about your failing to complete it the entire month he is gone. \n\nBeyond all this, it may be smart to just make a budgeted list of what you would need to spend money on if you DID do Christmas, even for the basics. Make it detailed. Leave it for him. Maybe he will come around and realize what a piece of stuff he is for doing this to you and your kids, and come groveling. I don't think so, but that's the effort I would suggest if this is super abnormal and maybe he's just been a compete moron. I don't think it will matter cause he seems to be an irrational jerkwad, but maybe you will think it's worth a shot. \n\nI wish you well. Take care of yourself.", "NTA: he cancelled Christmas.

So, he\u2019s going to be gone over a month, expects you to fund that time for the family, AND get Christmas together on $100? Clearly this financial abuse, among other things.  A lot of alarm bells go off with this story too. This can\u2019t be in the US because no one gets that amount of time off for vacation and still has a job for something like this. And make it 3 people gone over a month- definitely not employed, or not actually on a holiday unless they too are working there. Are you sure it\u2019s his friend\u2019s girlfriend? And not his?  Because I also have a hard time thinking a guy will pay for his friend\u2019s girlfriend to travel for over a month. His attitude about his time,  knowing he\u2019s the breadwinner and a family man is also suspicious.  It\u2019s one thing to feel you don\u2019t have time for yourself, and it\u2019s another to abandon them for over a month and expect Christmas on so little. Has he had to work a lot of overtime? Out late? Not back at all? If so, there\u2019s a good chance the woman on the trip is his affair partner. \n\nWhy do a lot of SAHMs feel they don\u2019t have a say in the family finances just because as a couple they decided she would manage the home and kids vs. get a job? Why is it you feel it\u2019s his money alone? The money he earns supports the family. And you and the kids are his family. He has withdrawn that financial support for purely selfish reasons. Additionally, when one decides to become a parent and have a family doing things like this - abandoning your family financially at a critical time period, especially if they are the single breadwinner in the family, is abusive and unacceptable. \n\nYou need to decide if this behavior is one you will tolerate for the rest of your life, and if you\u2019re on board with your kids learning this, being hurt by this, or emulating it. I sure hope you don\u2019t because we don\u2019t need more crappy people in this world. \n\nYou have a month to check into his finances and find evidence of an affair or other misbehavior. And to make sure he\u2019s still employed. You also need to ensure that you and the kids are financially safe - I mean it\u2019s more than a month - surely you have access to other funds for food and bills?  If not I hope you can reach out to your parents or in-laws for help. \n\nI would avoid contact with him if at all possible for the time being while you check out what\u2019s going on.  If you do have to contact him, try not to get involved in anything with him that would tip him off that you are investigating. Keep your investigation quiet. Get an attorney and get guidance on your rights as a SAHM and his abandonment. Then once you have the facts, make a decision if you want to stay in this type of situation or not, or if the kids should. \n\nI think you will find that there is more happening here than just a holiday abroad. You must take action to protect yourself and your kids. Don\u2019t trust that he will be back and all will be fine. I don\u2019t think it will be. If nothing else this obsession has proven that he is out of control and is willing to hurt you and the kids over it. And that\u2019s not okay. At the worst, he has left to spend over a month abroad with his mistress, and left his dependent family without the financial means to survive, and without notice. If he is so disgruntled about his life, this time away could be a stepping stone to leaving altogether when the pressure he\u2019s been feeling has been relieved. Be proactive and protect your family. Take action today. I really hope I\u2019m wrong. But his behavior is full of red flags.

I like to drop this link here for you and anyone else who might be in a similar situation. Please read the book when it is safe for you to do so and if you feel that your situation does ring true for abuse like it does to us then please start planning your safe exit for you and yours. These situations hardly ever get better and often start with one type of abuse and start building on to other different types. Please seek help you deserve  better.\n\nIf you think that you might be in an abusive relationship but you're not a 100% sure take a look at this book by Lundy Bancroft.  If there are situations where you think that you are not being respected or if the response to certain situations seems to be unproportional. If you feel that you can't move left or right without catching it for doing something wrong. You are not crazy you are not wrong you are 9 times out of 10 not at fault. You might just not have known you are in a relationship with an abuser. They often use incremental changes to get what they want slowly and so that you are less likely to notice. \nThe Book \"why does he do that\" by Lundy Bancroft (free copy below) is a great resource for you to learn about the different types of tactics that abusers use and will help you to see if your current relationship is following any of the patterns described.\n If you don't see your relationship being discussed either as one of the architypes or as bits and pieces of any of the other types then you're not worse off by having the knowledge.  If the information does coincide with the way that you're living then there's also a couple chapters on being able to get out safely.\n I wish you the best of luck and I want you to know that you deserve to be with a partner who is going to love you and cherish you and treat you as an equal versus being with someone who's gonna control you be it by how you dress or by finances or by What it is that you can do or who you can see.

She and her husband would rent their house out for the 4-6 weeks of racing season and go on an RV trip. They made enough money off the house rental to cover their trip AND all of their property taxes for the year.

Geez, please I wanna really see how he planned this is enough.", "Nah. I don't understand it  AT ALL.  He's going for a month. Qatar is expensive. The games will be expensive.

Did you experience feel like that?", "That, plus it doesn't sound like he really makes enough to be throwing around that much money.  I think OP should get a credit check done, both for herself and for him.  Double check the 401k to make sure he isn't draining it.

OP has to be VERY careful how she approaches her next steps.  \n\nThere are resources available for women in this situation.  But she does need to first consult a family lawyer.
