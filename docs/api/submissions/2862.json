I was completely shocked I told him 100$ for an entire family's christmas celebration was ridiculously not enough. He shrugged saying it's all he's got but I pointed out how he's paying for his friend's and his girlfriend's travel expenses. He told me to just \"take it\" but I said that if he decided to leave me with just 100 bucks then I won't be doing anything for christmas. We had lots of arguments and couldn't get this resolved.\n\n\n\nHe's in Qatar now (he left days ago). Yesterday, while I was cleaning I found an envelope with the same 100$ and a note from him telling me \"to make it work\". I sent him a message that I've decided that I won't be doing anything for christmas with this little money, period.

Realize that shit is not free, I bet he\u2019ll change his tune real quick. I agree with the comment saying you should have Christmas with your kids at your parents and just exclude husband, and really consider leaving him cuz that\u2019s financially abusive.

Why is it 'his' money when you are in charge of household admin and childcare while he waltzes off with his friends to pay thousands to watch a bunch of overpaid eejuts kick a ball around a stadium built on eco destruction and human rights violations? \nNo sane person from this century could pull of Christmas with 100bucks unless they go in for petty theft on a grand scale. \nUltimatum time, he treats you as an equal financially or you leave and get child support.", "NTA\n\nAs has been pointed out, this is called financial abuse.

Paid for his friend and his friends gf even though point 1 exists.\n\n3. Expects you to plan, cater and buy Christmas decorations etc with $100 and just deal with it. \n\n4. Is gaslighting you and blaming you for his selfish actions/choices. \n\n5. It is not HIS money. It is FAMILY money. Im sure if you worked and pulled a stunt like this he would be more that pissed. \n\n6. Use the $100 to get a locksmith. He doesn't value you and your contributions to the family, nor your 3 kids.

See a lawyer before he returns.", "NTA. Why is he paying for his friend and friend's girlfriend to go?? How much did that trip cost???\n\nYou need to get out of this relationship.

He is financially responsible for you and the kids before himself. He signed up for that when he married you. A sahm is a 24 hour job. He\u2019s gone for what, a whole month?!

You are NTA and I would be livid if my husband just left me with 3 kids for that long. And he is also paying for his friends expenses??? He is putting his friends before his family, which is not ok.

I genuinely do not understand what he expects you to accomplish with $100..", "You're NTA. It's not \"his\" money. It's both of yours money. Do you have idea what it would cost to pay someone to do everything you do? \n\nHe is the one blowing a fortune on himself and his friends, so he is the one robbing his children of Christmas presents. If this behavior is typical, you would benefit from talking to a lawyer about your options.", "NTA \n\nDo you have family you and the kids can stay with for Christmas?\n\nYou should look into getting a job and leave his sorry excuse for a human being, you and the kids deserve so much better", "NTA, and at least you know where is priorities lie, now. Sure as shit not with his wife and kids. I\u2019m sorry, OP. Best Christmas wishes!", "NTA...take the hundred bucks and leave. This sounds awful.", "NTA.   There are deep deep problems with your relationship and his treatment of you and your children.", "I am confused on how he thinks it is ok to pay for a friend and the friend's girlfriend to go and not leave enough money for Christmas? Also leaving for a month is also pretty crappy when you have 3 kids. My ex husband did this to me a lot. When my 2nd child was 3 months old I left. This is abuse. NTA", "NTA. The audacity to tell you to do whatever with 100$ and then take tickets for his friend and his gf???? Leave him. You're not his priority", "NTA.   Not being able to buy any beer at the stadium has brought out his inner scrooge.", "NTA sounds like financial abuse or the start of it. You deserve to be treated like an equal. You are raising the kids, that is your job and his is out the home, both are valuable and you both are adding value to the relationship. That money is both of yours and no one person should get to determine how the bulk is spent leaving one of you without and struggling to make do and then being verbally abused when his expectations aren\u2019t met.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a healthy relationship. Its financial abuse, it\u2019s emotionally controlling and it has the potential to be full abuse if it\u2019s not already.\n\nIdk if you need to hear this, my mother did. A man does not need to hit you to be abusing you. Control is a form of abuse, financial control and manipulation is a form of abuse and it can sneak up slowly over time so you don\u2019t know.\n\nThen when you question them, they throw it back at you and you somehow end up on the defensive or being blamed. For example he blamed you for robbing the kids of Christmas when the original question was about the money he was using.\n\nYou do not have to stay for your kids, they will be better with a happy mother. You don\u2019t have to do it alone there is so much help out there and financial aide.\n\nI could be way off base but on the off chance that I am not I needed to say something", "NTA - and your financial situation\u2026 aka you and your children living at his whim and ego is grounds for leaving him. I would never allow my significant other to control me so much. You deserve better. My mom left with three children when we were 7yo, you can do it too.", "NTA he\u2019s being financially abusive. Take this time while he\u2019s out to find a place for you and your kids to live.", "NTA, but you will be if you stay. A marriage is a partnership of values, love, resources, and responsibility. None of that is evident in your message so the best Xmas gift you can give your family is to leave him", "NTA. It seems like you\u2019ve got a solid month in which to get yourself moved out of the house and to file for divorce before he comes back, I\u2019d take advantage of that time.", "I have 1 kid. $100 wouldn't pay for the holiday meal for the 3 of us", "NTA. If you have a joint account, which you should because there is no \"his\" money if you are SAHP, get more out for Christmas or hire a divorce attorney. He is abusive and ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nFinancial abuse.\nPlain and simple.", "Can't you talk to your parents or siblings to have Christmas with them (without husband obviously) ? Like starting as soon as the kids don't go to school for winter break.\n\nYou're NTA, but you would be if you let your kids go without Christmas, with you and your husband fighting. You would also be the asshole if you don't start planning for a divorce. A guy who leaves 100 dollars for Christmas while he goes to enjoy a stupid sport event and paid for his friend and GF to go doesn't deserve you or your kids. \n\nI don't know you but I'm sure you can do a thousand times better than this loser.", "NTA for being mad at him, but please do something for your kids sake. Their dad obviously doesn't care about them, so make sure they know you do.", "His finances would be way worse if you divorced him.  Yours would be better.  NTA.", "NTA. It's not *his* money, it's the family's. He's being incredibly selfish and ignoring his duties of being the sole breadwinner of the household. If I were you, I'd be changing locks right about now and seeking an attorney.", "NTA. This is ridiculous and wild. I\u2019m going to the World Cup too but we\u2019ve had literally 4 years to prepare and save up for this trip! Him paying for his friend and his girlfriends tickets is ridiculous and shows what kind of man he is.

But has some for his friends? \n\nPlease leave. And find a job.", "NTA, divorce is the only option here", "NTA.\n\nHe placed his company for his trip over his kid's Christmas.

How old are your kids? Why are you so dependent on your husband? Why does he have such a distorted understanding of your partnership? Why does he seem to not understand how much things cost? What is it that he actually wants you to do? If your kids care, can you do something with or for them that's inexpensive but festive? What role does your family play in all this? Do you have other money for groceries and expenses and then the$100 is just \"Christmas\"?\n\nIf it's a good relationship otherwise, you could just write this off as a one time thing and try to move forward, but there's a lot here that doesn't make sense.", "What is he expecting you to buy for the kids for that amount?

Are you saying that he is paying for a trip for three people for 4 weeks to go to the world Cup??? That must cost thousands!!! And then he tells you to make Christmas work with 100?! He is a bad partner and father. I get the need to be selfish once in a while but this is way beyond acceptable. Why must he pay for his friend and their girlfriend if it means he cannot afford to provide properly for his family?? This sounds really f***Ed up. And also: it is not his money.

What does he pay you for being a SAHM?", "'I didn't want to judge him since it's his money eventually.' but it's not - you are working too and if you added up the cost of paying someone to care for 3 children and for a housekeeper you'd realise your contribution probably equals if not exceeds his. \n\nHe's being controlling.
