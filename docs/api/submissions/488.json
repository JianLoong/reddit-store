For me  having a dog would be decisive with a fenced in yard for the dog would be decisive - how wonderful for your dog (and you) if they can romp freely. It is also much easier for you as when I lived in a place with a fenced yard it was great to be able to open the door in the early morning so the dog could pee quickly or late at night for the same reason. It doesn't replace a nice walk but it is so convenient and the only time many dogs can romp freely without a leash.\n\nThe only thing you would need to do to be a \\*nice\\* neighbor is to tell your neighbor you are getting the fence. My understanding is that there are \"good neighbor\" style fences which look good on either side and you might want to check into one of those. If they cost more some people ask neighbors to cover the cost of the differential between that and a regular fence or else they just install a regular fence if the neighbor doesn't want to pay.\n\nETA I grew up in a large city in a private home with a tiny back yard. No one played in the back yards but if you were playing with other kids on the block you played games on the sidewalk or in the front of your house like Stoop Ball (which is (or was) a Brooklyn thing. There are all manner of games that urban kids play like Ringolevio, Capture the Flap, potsy and hopscotch OR (and here is a new thought) you actually went to a playground or park for extended type of play.

I wasn't a poor kid - middle class - but middle class when I was a kid was a pale substitute for the kind of lavish amusements kids have now - we had bikes; we had skates (the kind you put on with a skate key). We had Spaldeen balls - the Brooklyn pronunciation for the pink balls manufactured by Spalding Company - they were so beloved that when the company ceased manufacturing they were eventually brought back for nostalgia. \n\nStoops are the front steps of a building - typically somewhat steep and made of concrete or stones.

But our friend wasn\u2019t too far off the mark. In actuality, \"Potsy\" is simply New Yorker-speak for \"Hopscotch.\" It originated in Britain during the early Roman Empire, and it\u2019s been played throughout the city for generations. Today, there are variations of the game in countries all around the world including Aruba (where it\u2019s called \"Pele\"), Bolivia (\"La Thunkuna\"), and France (\"Escargot\").\n\nStoop Ball\n\n  \nStoopball is a game loosely based around baseball. It originated in Brooklyn and other inner cities. \"Stoop\" in Dutch means steps or front steps. New York's first European settlers were the Dutch. The term is a remnant of New York's Dutch origins. Stoopball reached its peak popularity after the World War II, when children played the game on the steps in front of residential buildings.\n\n  \nStoopball is played by throwing a ball against a stoop (a small staircase or a porch in front of a building). In its simplest form, stoopball is played by one or more players, who stand about 10-15 feet from the stoop and throw the ball at it. When the ball returns, you have to catch it on one bounce worth 5 points or on a fly worth 10 points. The most certain way to win the game is to catch a few pointers worth 100 points each. A pointer is a ball that hits the edge of the step. It retains most of its original force and shoots back like a bullet or flies over your head. If you catch one on a fly, you get 100 points. The winning score is usually 1,000 points, but it can be any arbitrary total agreed upon.\n\n  \nAnother scoring system was based on baseball. If the ball bounced once, it was a single; twice, it was a double, and so on. The players kept the base positions and scores in their heads. The fielders had to catch the ball on the fly to record an out. Timeout was called for passing cars.
