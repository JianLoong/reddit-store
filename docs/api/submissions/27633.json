She passed unexpectedly a little over a week after my 55th birthday. \n\nWe were very close. We talked everyday. She was my biggest supporter when I was having health issues and I was scared of what was coming. \n\nShe cheered for me when I decided to go back to school to work on an associate degree in general studies. \n\nShe was the first person I called when my dad died, then my mom, then my brother. She cried with me and comforted me. \n\nI spiraled into some pretty dark places in the months following her death but I managed to pull myself out. I had help from a lot of other friends, plus our close circle of friends. \n\nIt\u2019s coming up on my birthday again, and it\u2019ll be the first birthday without her. I\u2019ve been kind of up and down emotionally this week, and couple of friends of mine flat out told me that I should be over my grieving by now. And I am not the only one who lost somebody.\n\nThat really hurt my feelings, because I know I\u2019m not the only one who lost somebody. And last I knew there was never a timeline for grieving. \n\nSo rather harshly, I told them to back off because they didn\u2019t know how I was feeling. I told them they were being AHs because they lost a friend too, but they aren\u2019t acting like it.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1695683300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16s72l5/aita_for_telling_my_friends_to_back_off_and_let/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's the first year without your best friend and your other friends are just being cruel about it. No one should tell you that you should be \"over it\", it's only been coming up a year. Continue telling your friends to back off.", "NTA each person grieves in their own time; they need to back off.", "NTA in any way.\n\nGrief is personal and no one has the right to tell you how or for how long you need. \n\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. There is no statute of limitations on grief to begin with, and this is another \u201cfirst\u201d without her. Naturally, you\u2019re going to be hurting. Your friends are being highly insensitive. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss OP. I feel it too. It\u2019s not yet been 3 years since I lost my bestie. I still miss her everyday. I don\u2019t cry as much as I used to, but yesterday was a hard day with some tears. My heart goes out to you.", "NTA, if I lost my best friend whom I've been friends with for over 50 years,  I'd still be grieving after a year.   No one can tell you how to grieve.", "Tell you what. If my BFF dies before I do, check back with me in a decade or so. I might be able to lift my head up by that time. \n\nYour grief is real, and you'll heal on your own timetable. \n\nNTA.", "Don't allow others to tell you how long you can grieve.\n\nI have a friend who is at the 8 year mark with her grief and she still posts about it often like it happened yesterday. Refuses to get counseling and romanticises a relationship with her husband that was not there! (They were separated at the time because the husband had a horrific drug problem) I still let her talk about it and allow her to have her moments. I know first hand what's it like to lose someone you are close with and still wish that they were here every day. So you know what? Have at it. Have your grief for as long as  you want. Screw every one else!", "NTA Grief isn\u2019t a one and done thing, I\u2019ve lost a few folk in my life and I still get sad when I think about them, it\u2019s only human to do such. It\u2019s cruel to try to confine grief in most instances.", "Nta. \nWhat do they mean \"not the one who.lost somebody?\" You lost a friend, a close and long friendship. That is so painful. \nNo one gets to decide when someone else should be \"done\" grieving. It's an individual and personal experience.", "NTA. They don't get to dictate your grief. There's no timeline for this, and if there were, it would be at least a year. You haven't even mourned a missed birthday. That's gonna be incredibly hard, and I'm sorry you're going throb it.", "NTA, grieve how you need to. Don\u2019t expect to get invited to a lot of parties though.", "NTA. There is no time limit nor level limit on grief. It will be a lifelong process. If your friends won't give you the time and space you need, then you have every right to tell them to back off.", "NTA. Grief doesn't have a time table  i am sorry for your loss.", "NTA. grief is unexpected. you take as long as you need & let out that hurt. they should\u2019ve respected your boundaries. im sorry for your loss.", "NTA!!!! We all grieve differently, and in different ways. \n\nI lost my sister in 2013 and tried to be a workaholic to push it under the rug, along with a heavy drinking habit. Then in 2016 and 2017 I lost 2 more very close family members and it became more than I could bare so I spiraled a bit. I did okay for awhile. But it was just the 10 year anniversary of my sister\u2019s death and it hit really, really hard. \n\nSo tell everyone that says anything other than do you need anything? or do you wanna get together? To just fuck off. I\u2019ve learned a lot of people have either never experienced anything really bad in their life or are just selfish pricks, either way they suck. So tell them to fuck off, \n\nI think your friend would approve of my advice! I\u2019m sure they are smiling down on you from wherever they ended up.", "NTA grief is a never ending process. You will never \u201cget over it\u201d, it will be less that you think of it as time goes on, but every time you think of it, it\u2019s like you lose them all over again, although the pain is less intense. Tell your friends to STFU", "NTA. You are still grieving the loss of beloved friend nd important person in your life. And if you need some alone time then that\u2019s perfectly fine!", "NTA-what a beautiful friendship, I am so glad you had each other. Grief is a process not an event.  \n\nI gently suggest grief counseling, I went after the death of my mother and it was so important to my healing.  It is not meant to be long term treatment but more to help you process and figure out what your life looks like now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
