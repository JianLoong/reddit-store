Isn't the entire purpose of an elopement to like do it semi-secretly or with as few people as possible? Does bro not know what an elopement is? Sounds like maybe he has main character syndrome. I could understand him being upset if you two were close, but it sounds like he's just jealous, especially if he had to eat up all of mommy's time while you were having your dinner AND wants an apology. Eugh. Sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA- you definitely have a parent problem. Did your mom even have permission to post about the wedding on social media?\n\nYou should go low contact with your mom. Obviously you didn\u2019t want a big to-do or you wouldn\u2019t have eloped!! Instead she spent the whole evening soothing the ruffled feathers of her baby boy instead of celebrating her other child\u2019s wedding.", "Nta welcome to my world.  Only it was my sister that was the favorite due to a childhood illness.  I am sorry but from my own experience this situation will never change. I finally moved away. The distance helped and my mental health got so much better.  You are married now.  Time to step away from parents and brother and create a new life with your husband. Keep contact but never expect them to change. If you do you will always be hurt and disappointed. Good luck in your new married life. Past is the past.  Future holds it all. Make it a good future.", "NTA it was your wedding day even if it was low key and your mom tried to make it about your brother. Congratulations on your marriage though!", "Your brother found out from FB that you got married? That\u2019s kind of strange in itself. It appears no one talks to brother. \n\nSeems like your Mom is the issue here not your brother. She simply could have told him she would call him after dinner. \n\nNTA \u2014 your Mom was rude to be texting during dinner.", "NTA\nPay for witnesses and leave your parents at home to fawn over the golden child.", "NTA at all. A Wedding (however a Couple decides to it) is about the Couple.. Not the Parents, Siblings or anyone else who suffers from main character syndrome.", "NTA,  but your mom was. First, for sharing your news before you had the chance to yourself and second, for making it about your brother. You owe your brother no apology.  Your mom owes you one, though.", "NTA - however I wouldn't have included my parents in anything as important as my wedding if there was even a chance they'd divert attention in a predictable direction. Might be time to keep them out of your business.", "NTA\nWow. Your mom couldn't let you have one special moment without drawing drama into it. She's the a-hole.\n\nYou have good reason to feel ambushed and betrayed. Not only did she create friction, she did it right in the middle of your intimate celebration. She stole your joy, and made your distant brother's \"upset\" the focus of the day.", "NTA.  The nice thing about getting married is that now you get to create your own family, however you choose.   You should tell your parents that this is the last time they and your brother get to create drama and change the focus.  From now on, it's yours and your partner's show", "NTA go no contact with your brother and low contact with your parents. Enjoy your marriage!!!!", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nhe sounds exhausting which should be their problem, not yours.", "NTA\n\nHe did that on purpose and she allowed it. \n\n\n\n\nThis is also why it's in bad taste to immediately run to social media when you're celebrating someone's wedding. She didn't even make it through dinner before ruining it for you.", "NTA\n\nPerhaps it's time to reconsider whether any family members should act as your witnesses. You could always say \"Thank you for pointing out how unfair/unkind it is for us to exclude some family members from our wedding. We have considered our options and have decided to ask non-family members to act as our witnesses.\"", "YTA. It's okay to have a small-do wedding or an elopement. With a small-do;  you typically tell family and friends even if you don't invite them to be present.\n\nWith an elopement any small number of people are fine (even strangers). If you choose your parents, you have to convince or pressure them to be dishonest to your other family. Your mom felt terrible for being dishonest to your brother and over-compensated.\n\nWhile she was wrong for doing what she did. It's you who created this situation by asking her to lie for you. In real terms your wedding was less an elopement and more a small-do where your brother was intentionally excluded.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell her how disappointed you are in HER and that she couldn\u2019t even devote 3h to focus on you, on your wedding day.

How incredibly sad not to have enough of a life of your own that you feel you must go where your parents are going. \n\nI hope you took your time before calling your brother back as who wants to call to likely hear kvetching and whining on their wedding day?  \n\nI will say you now know not to invite or share info with your parents as to anything you don\u2019t also feel the need to include your brother.  Then you don\u2019t have to worry about hurting your brother\u2019s feels and your parents won\u2019t feel guilty they did or knew something brother didn\u2019t.", "NTA ... but they will never understand what they have done. Be grateful that their attention on your brother has resulted in you being a strong, independent woman and essentially crippled him for life.", "NTA but your mother is.", "Is it an elopement if parents are there? \n\nElope means to run away secretly to get married, especially without parental consent. Having parents present sounds, at the very least, against the spirit of eloping. \n\nWhich isn't really the point, but this continues a recent trend of people saying \"elope\" when they just mean \"small wedding\".\n\nHad OP truly eloped, the issue with brother probably would have been avoided.\n\nI dunno, I lean a bit to ESH. Brother sounds not great but yeah, for sure he was cut out of what is usually a family event.", "My childhood and teenage years. My older brother was \u201cborn with a hole in his heart\u201d and it has been his personality trait since. My parents sheltered him because of his heart, so he didn\u2019t have a strong social life as a kid. So, no sports playing, playing games like relay racing/Freeze Tag, hanging out in the parks, etc.\n\nTo this day, he (44y.o.) can\u2019t even make his own doctors and dentist appointments without my mom doing it. He\u2019s a married father of three. \n\nMeanwhile, my mom wonders why I am so independent and I don\u2019t talk about my physical health struggles.", "NTA\nHer mom posted the wedding on FB not OP.\n\nThen the brother calls upset.\n\nThink about that for a second.  If the dynamic is as OP says, mom knew that Golden boy would be upset something wasn't about him and need comforting from his mommy.", "Where did OP ask their mom to lie to their brother?", "\"Especially without parental consent\"? It's literally just getting married without an audience. You still need to have two people for witnesses, and having parents as the witnesses is fine? What are you talking about???\n\nIt literally has nothing to do with going against parents' wishes. I have no idea where you got that impression.", "i was thinking the same thing because the brother didnt know about it til the post.  i mean why didnt mommy say something before they left for the wedding?", "I mean unless OP had explicitly told mom not to post, the I can't see how she didn't expect things to go down exactly how it did, if not then then sometime. Was the plan just to have everyone keep the secret until after the day, and just let the mom and bro hash it out over why she didn't tell him? Based on their dynamic, and history it's not necessarily enough to make OP TA, but she certainly didn't do much to protect herself from such a predictable fallout IMO.", "What was the plan otherwise, since mom making the post caused such a predictable fallout that OP hated?", "Historically, couples would elope (meaning abscond) if and when their families didn't approve of the union. So while the meaning would have loosened up some since, \"elopement with parents\" does sound a little funny. I'm in Europe and my understanding of elopement would still be that of going against the grain somehow, maybe with the family not fully on board or difficult or feuding.", "Are we not living in the year 2023? It is an absurd claim to say that parental involvement and elopement can not coincide in the modern day. What a ridiculous notion and so disrespectful to those who are choosing alternative wedding options.", "We are indeed living in 2023 which is why I don't understand why people say they are \"eloping\" because yeah, if your parents are there how are you eloping... It's just a small wedding.", "Nobody disses alternative wedding options, elopement might simply not be the best label for some because of the \"eloping from\" connotation. It might be different where you are but here we would say \"witnesses only wedding\", \"registry office wedding\", \"intimate wedding\" etc if there is no aggravating factor. To say that someone eloped would be to imply that there was something there to elope from, typically family matters.\n\nI guess it's a word like \"expat\" now, when a more precise meaning has been expanded to cover any case that suits.", "Okay well either way imo it's OP's choice to decide who to have at her \"small wedding\" and bro didn't make the cut. Pretty sure her groom didn't even invite anyone from his family at all. To me a small wedding means like.. at least both sets of parents, maybe a best friend. Either way though OP gets to decide who gets to be there. She needed witnesses and she (and presumably the partner) trusted her parents. If my brother got married with just my parents present I would say congrats and leave them to it, even though I consider us close, having literally only 2 people there as witnesses and he chose mom and dad? I'd understand that. That's his day and his choice and I'd probably ask if he wanted to go out for dinner on another night with me and his new partner to celebrate. Even if my feelings were hurt, I can tell him that privately later and we can see if we can move past it. I don't need to blow up my mom's phone while she's having dinner.", "Elopement. A running away; an escape; private or unlicensed departure from the place or station to which one is bound by duty or law: specifically applied to the running away of a woman, married or unmarried, with a lover. Not really an elopement to just have a small wedding. But ok."]}
