So while the meaning would have loosened up some since, \"elopement with parents\" does sound a little funny.

Pretty sure her groom didn't even invite anyone from his family at all. To me a small wedding means like.. at least both sets of parents, maybe a best friend. Either way though OP gets to decide who gets to be there. She needed witnesses and she (and presumably the partner) trusted her parents. If my brother got married with just my parents present I would say congrats and leave them to it, even though I consider us close, having literally only 2 people there as witnesses and he chose mom and dad?

Alternatively do what everyone else does - grab random strangers from the bar for the signatures.", "NTA, but inviting your parents was a mistake because instead eloping you essentially had a tiny wedding with just your parents, especially since you had kind of a reception dinner with them afterwards.
