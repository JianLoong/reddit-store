If your sister can't understand that then she can settle for the mock wedding! Same with your brother and mother. That's very silly to be that upset about not getting an invitation if you refuse to come without kids. Don't let them ruin your day!

It sounds like your sister is very bratty and immature. Classic golden child. Don't invite her", "NTA. I love my kids, they would hate weddings. Some things can just be for grownups!

That's a valid concern since she did it once before. Stick to your guns, no invitation for a sister with a history of destroying weddings.\nAlso why are your family mad if she already declared she won't attend?

Why waste invitations on people who have already said they're not going? You're calling their bluff. When they ask, tell them exactly what they told you. They said they weren't going so why should they expect an invite?", "The thing is, that she will still find out where and when it is. If you not sending an invitation is to avoid her being able to crash, that won\u2019t work.\n\nPersonally I\u2019m conscious that some people love to be included and invited, even if they won\u2019t attend. It shows thought, care and being the bigger person.\n\nI\u2019m also thinking that the shouty squally children will be older and (hopefully) better behaved by then - not to say you should include them, but that holding behaviour over them from a couple of years ago isn\u2019t fair - though holding adult behaviour from your sister absolutely is.\n\nIf it were me I would still keep an invitation for her and mail it. Because if she sticks to your rules she *is* welcome, right?\n\nBut I would include a covering note reminding her of your conversations, that it\u2019s child free, and that you will be engaging security at your wedding to ensure it stays that way.\n\nThen the ball is in her court, you aren\u2019t preventing her from attending at all.\n\nOBV if you have a problem with her attending anyway the above is redundant.\n\nIn any case, you are NTA.", "NTA if you know about a childfree event one year before it happens and you cant find a babysitter for your shitlings something is wrong with you and possible them.", "Don\u2019t send them an invite. \n\nDo invest in security, to divert family members with kids away. \n\nNTA", "Weddings are family events. Children are big part of families. Draw your own conclusions.", "NTA, since she told you she wouldn't be coming already. However, if you are worried about her actually showing up with kids, not giving her a physical invite won't stop her if that is her plan since she likely knows the info already and other family members could easily share theirs with her. I would probably just send her an invite to avoid this battle with your family knowing it won't actually change anything.", "Crazy seeing these comments. Ytah. You don\u2019t want to invite your entire family to your wedding?!\n\nWhat do you think a wedding is exactly? You are joining your families, but you don\u2019t want yours to come. Do you want to cut your family out of your life? \n\nI mean if you do, sure, that\u2019s your prerogative.

In total there's over 30 kids (from close friends and family) that we would have to invite. My partner and I are the ones paying for this wedding. Family isn't chipping in at all. And yes it is cheaper to have a second \"wedding\" (which is what they do in my culture) when we get back from the honeymoon. Although we are pushing the date out a few extra months. People don't have to get dressed up unless they want to. The only ones who would dress up is my partner and myself. The second wedding will be held in my back yard like any kids birthday. And no they aren't expected to bring any presents.", "NTA \nDon\u2019t allow your entitled family manipulate or gaslight you into inviting your sister and her kids. \nYour wedding your rules. \nDon\u2019t be a doormat. \nUninvite anyone that threats to not attend. \nCongratulations \ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf88 \n\nNTA", "I agree that some children can be a joy - I would have loved to have your son at my wedding.  We went childfree for two reasons\n\n1. cost, by the time I was married, I already had 10 nieces and nephews and we were having a very small wedding - we only had 30 people total at our wedding so we couldn't afford adding 10 children as well\n2. 4 of those 10 children just didn't listen - they were like OP's nieces and nephews, they were loud, run around, spill, get into everything and would definitely have ruined the cake and probably have managed to get it and whatever they were drinking on my dress\n\nSometimes you have to go childfree at your wedding because some of your siblings are simply bad parents, smh\n\nOn the other hand, I had the wedding of my dreams and all the parents had a peaceful, relaxing night off.  None of them complained about getting babysitters, lol", "Right?!? I still remember the fit my younger brother threw the first time I remember eating at a sit down waitress comes to the table restaurant. Now to be fair it was Sunday after church and they were slammed, but he was so horrible waiting for the food to arrive, then and there at the age of about 11 I decided I was going to introduce my kids to something other than fast food while they were little so as not to repeat that scene!", "MelodramaticMouse is right hire security but also give them photos of your parents and brother so they'll be unable to open a side door and let them in.", "Take the money you\u2019ll save from the cost of feeding them (which is a lot, depending on the caterer), and hire security for your wedding. Congratulations and enjoy!", "> My brother had a handfasting.\n\nhello what is this? what's a handfasting?", "Yeah, it sounds like the child-free decision was because of how the sister's kids behaved at the prior wedding.", "Also your cousins were decently well-behaved. Her sister has already proved that hers are a menace screaming through the wedding and taking the cake previously. That\u2019s when a parent steps in and prevents the kid from running for the cake and takes them outside to scream to their hearts content without bothering anyone", "This is how all of my dad\u2019s family weddings worked. Including when the adults at one uncle\u2019s wedding were starting to get a little more drunk and outrageous than we, the teens, were comfortable with, we all bailed to the hotel across the street and set up the littler kids in one room with a movie while the older kids were in another room with our own movie and took turns checking in the kids till the parents came in a few hours later.", "I still remember the two kids (around 7 or 8) who tried to jump on the trailing back of my dress to rip it off. They failed because the back was way longer than it looked, I had the excess folded and held with a few points. So the thread broke but not the dress. Thank goodness. I was furious, the mom had barely glanced at what her sons were doing.", "Time to stand up for yourself.\n\nThere's no need for further conversation with your parents and siblings regarding this topic. \n\nDoes having a relationship add any value to your life?  Or is it that is just become a habit?  Habits can be broken you know.\n\nYour fiance is your family now. He comes first.", "Plus the wedding is next year. Yet sister is saying \"we can't get a babysitter\"? She doesn't WANT to get a babysitter. \n\nEven without how they all acted at the last wedding they crashed, this \"can't find a babysitter in a year\" act is BS.", "Give them sisters picture to kick out wholesale or the more *questionable idea* - let her stay if she's alone, but tell security, \"if she has any kids with her, she's gone\"\n\nId personally go with the former all around.", "I mean, if her kids are as bad as they sound, the family could be basically blacklisted for childcare services...", "A lot of venues to have their own security already, it\u2019s really not that absurd and makes it so the guests and guests of honor don\u2019t have to deal with it. OP can stay on the dance floor while her idiot sister is dealt with by professionals since she can\u2019t listen to logic ahead of time."]}
