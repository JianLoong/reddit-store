We sent out the \"save the date\" cards with a nice note saying that it will be adults only event (18+) as most of our friends and family members have kids. Our friends and my partners family don't have any issues with this. They all are happy to have a night away from the kids and were grateful for a years notice to find babysitters. My family however, weren't. My sister has told me that she and my BIL won't be able to attend as their kids (ranging she from 7 to 13) won't be allowed to attend and she can't find a babysitter. I suggested her inlaws (as a possibility) who regularly look after her kids and explained my reasons for having an adult only event (cost being one of them and we were going to do a separate day where we have a mock wedding after we get back from the honeymoon) but she still refused to attend. I said that's fine and I respect her decision, and said I won't send her an invite as to not rub the wedding in her face. Now my parents and brother are angry at me for not going to send her an invite (which will have the location (local) and time of the wedding) and are refusing to attend also. Last time she was invited to an adults only wedding, 2 years ago, she brought the her kids along (against the bride and grooms wishes) and they ended up screaming through the service and destroyed the cake.

Clearly she doesnt care enough to try, or is hoping you will change the policy and accommodate her. \n\nAs for not sending her an invite,  of course you wont send one.  She has specifically already told you she cant come. Sending an invite to someone you know cant make it is a waste of time and paper. \n\nI don't know what the rest of your family is thinking. Are you sure they heard the same verion of events from your sister? Because I cant see why they would overwhelmingly support her in this.  Hopefully you can at least fix whatever is happening there and have some family at your wedding.", "NTA but the entitlement of your sister is amazing. To have witnessed her kids ruin someone\u2019s wedding and still insist she get to bring her kids\u2026Although she probably blames everyone but her angels.\n\n\nDon\u2019t invite her or your family of enablers, so you can have a stress free, nut free wedding. Perhaps someone at the door to bar them from entering if you think they\u2019d go there. \nEdit word", "Sometimes I wonder if people were raised in a barn?\n\nAn elegant evening dinner dance is no place for children.\n\nYou need to do everything you can to prevent this woman from ruining your function and further more, tell your family to get a book on etiquette. Then they can understand what is correct and who is right in this situation.\n\nI am always shocked when I see these entitled people dragging their entire family to functions that other people are paying for.\nNo class at all.\n\nGlad you are addressing this early and upfront", "NTA\n\nA year out and she claims she can\u2019t find a babysitter? \n\nIf she has a habit of disrespecting people\u2019s wishes and you think there\u2019s a risk she will show up with the kids then don\u2019t invite her\n\nSounds like she enjoys stirring up drama and then playing the victim", "NTA , if you don't want kids there that's a choice you made to enjoy your day! If your sister can't understand that then she can settle for the mock wedding! Same with your brother and mother. That's very silly to be that upset about not getting an invitation if you refuse to come without kids. Don't let them ruin your day! If they can't be grown ups they are acting just like children anyways and shouldn't come. Good for you for standing up for yourself! You deserve to have the best wedding day exactly how you want it!", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s already shown that she shows up with uninvited \u201cguests\u201d (the kids). If your family won\u2019t respect your wishes, why the heck would you invite them?", "NTA , but your sister is , it's a power grab on her end and can't fathom you enjoying your day without her kids . she needs to grow up and understand she is not the center of the world .", "NTA. And it\u2019s clear where your sister gets her sense of entitlement from with your family behaving that way in response. I\u2019m really sorry that they are acting this way, but you deserve a day filled with people who love and care about you, and that are only concerned about celebrating you.", "NTA, but you are also not thinking this through.\n\nAs has been said, she'll find out where it is, so if she wants to show up not sending an invite won't help \n\nSending an invite and maintaining an adult dialogue seems the minimal disruption way to deal with it", "NTA\n\nYour wedding your rules.", "NTA. Don\u2019t send invites to your family. They will crash it. Hire some security.", "NTA. Your entire family is being manipulative. I wouldn't send any of them an invite so your sister doesn't show up with her kids anyway", "Nta. Don't invite her. She's the person who is always like but I got leave my babies. Ugh give me a break. It sounds like your sister is very bratty and immature. Classic golden child. Don't invite her", "NTA. I love my kids, they would hate weddings. Some things can just be for grownups! I would invite them, put child free in massive letters, then ask your partners family to be bouncers on the day and not let any children in. Hire a bouncer if you have to!", "Nta i would ask your parents and brother would you lime her kids doing the same at your wedding and theirs.", "NTA.\n\nmake sure you have someone at the entrance that will prevent from anyone with kids entering. your sister might still show up", "NTA\n\nSo basically you know your sister will probably take her kids and attend the wedding even after she told you she can't if you gave her a courtesy invitation? That's a valid concern since she did it once before. Stick to your guns, no invitation for a sister with a history of destroying weddings.\nAlso why are your family mad if she already declared she won't attend? Or do they already know of her plan to crach your wedding and are supporting her? Good! Now you have another three invitations you no longer need to bother sending!", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules. I'm a fan of children at weddings. I think they're adorable, hilarious, and a lot of fun, but I would never think of showing up at a wedding, with kids in tow, after being told it was child-free. That's just insane to ignore the happy couple's wishes like that.", "Wait, your sister has already stated that she can\u2019t find a babysitter for a wedding that is happening *a year from now*?? Wow, guess she has a magic crystal ball or something.\n\nIf this is all true then NTA and your sister is clearly trying to make excuses so that she can bring the kids.", "NTA. Why waste invitations on people who have already said they're not going? You're calling their bluff. When they ask, tell them exactly what they told you. They said they weren't going so why should they expect an invite?", "The thing is, that she will still find out where and when it is. If you not sending an invitation is to avoid her being able to crash, that won\u2019t work.\n\nPersonally I\u2019m conscious that some people love to be included and invited, even if they won\u2019t attend. It shows thought, care and being the bigger person.\n\nI\u2019m also thinking that the shouty squally children will be older and (hopefully) better behaved by then - not to say you should include them, but that holding behaviour over them from a couple of years ago isn\u2019t fair - though holding adult behaviour from your sister absolutely is.\n\nIf it were me I would still keep an invitation for her and mail it. Because if she sticks to your rules she *is* welcome, right?\n\nBut I would include a covering note reminding her of your conversations, that it\u2019s child free, and that you will be engaging security at your wedding to ensure it stays that way.\n\nThen the ball is in her court, you aren\u2019t preventing her from attending at all.\n\nOBV if you have a problem with her attending anyway the above is redundant.\n\nIn any case, you are NTA.", "NTA if you know about a childfree event one year before it happens and you cant find a babysitter for your shitlings something is wrong with you and possible them.", "Don\u2019t send them an invite. \n\nDo invest in security, to divert family members with kids away. \n\nNTA", "Weddings are family events. Children are big part of families. Draw your own conclusions.", "NTA, since she told you she wouldn't be coming already. However, if you are worried about her actually showing up with kids, not giving her a physical invite won't stop her if that is her plan since she likely knows the info already and other family members could easily share theirs with her. I would probably just send her an invite to avoid this battle with your family knowing it won't actually change anything.", "Crazy seeing these comments. Ytah. You don\u2019t want to invite your entire family to your wedding?!\n\nWhat do you think a wedding is exactly? You are joining your families, but you don\u2019t want yours to come. Do you want to cut your family out of your life? \n\nI mean if you do, sure, that\u2019s your prerogative. But if you care about your family, and you want them in your life you should know that not inviting them to your wedding is not how family treats one another.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
