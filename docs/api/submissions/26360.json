First off, thank you for the thoughtful advice and comments on my original post.\n\nAfter much contemplation, I decided to stick to my initial choice and not attend the wedding. It wasn't an easy decision, and I know it disappointed my family, especially my sister. I did have a conversation with her about it, explaining my reasons and feelings.\n\nShe expressed her disappointment, but surprisingly, she also understood where I was coming from. We had a long conversation about how her actions had caught me off guard and the importance of respecting my feelings and boundaries. It wasn't a perfect resolution, but it was a start.\n\nThe wedding happened without me, and from what I've heard, it was a beautiful day for her. Although I missed it, I'm glad she had a special day that she'll cherish. I still have mixed feelings about my decision, but for now, it feels like the right one for me.\n\nThanks again for your support and advice throughout this process. It's been a challenging situation, but I appreciate the understanding and insights from this community.", "created_utc": 1694055667, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16c4jca/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_my_sisters/", "score": 291, "replies": ["Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wypx8/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_my_sisters_wedding/)."]}
