I'm raising my two kids, 7F and 4M. I have a younger sister, Megan, 28F. Megan has a daughter, Ava, 5F.\n\nMy daughter Ruby turned 7 last week and she wanted a laser tag party. I planned her a birthday party at our nearest laser tag centre, and I allowed Ruby to invite two friends from school. It includes a few games of laser tag and a pizza dinner afterwards for the kids.\n\nBoth of Ruby's friends are vegetarians but luckily the laser tag place has plain cheese pizza that they can have.\n\nI invited a few family members as well, including Megan and her daughter. Megan declined, her reasoning being that Ava will not eat pizza and she'll feel left out.\n\nFor context\n\nAva has been a picky eater for a while. Whether this is due to neurodivergence or not, my guess is as good as anyone's because my sister has never taken her to a pediatrician about this (we live in a country with free healthcare, cost is not the issue). Megan just caves and plays restaurant with her all the time and never has her try anything new.\n\nAccording to Megan, the only things Ava will eat are chicken nuggets, plain cheese sandwiches, mashed potatoes and waffles. Megan just acts like this is not unusual or a problem at all, and says Ava will grow out of it eventually.\n\nThe problem started because Megan suggested that we change plans and after the laser tag games, we take all the kids to McDonald's. I told Megan about two of the kids at the party being vegetarians and that she's more than welcome to bring her own food to the party for Ava.\n\nMegan kept trying to persuade me and said Ruby's friends can bring their own food instead. I told her to stop because I'm not changing the plans, she can either come or not, at this point I was getting annoyed. Megan snapped at me and said the girls are choosing to be vegetarians, her daughter isn't choosing to be a picky eater, and I should prioritise my niece. I said it's not about priorities, I'm just not changing plans that are already made and booked. I told Megan she needs to address her daughter's eating habits because they are blatantly out of control.\n\nMy sister said there was no need for me to be rude and that I have no right to comment on her parenting, Ava isn't my child and I have no say. She said if I have a problem with that, I can go screw myself.\n\nMegan ended up not going to the party and my parents are intervening and saying that they understand why I said what I said, but it's still not my business and I should've just left it at \"I'm not changing the plans\" and I should apologize to Megan for the comment.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1694822127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jsx4z/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_daughters_eating/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have a freak of a picky eater too and I know it. Lol but I also don't bring extra food places for him cuz he actually tries food around others and if he doesnt he can eat when he gets home.

I still introduced new food items to them at every meal, and I didn't cater to their \"just chicken nuggets\" desire.\n\nThey're in their late 20s now, they'll eat anything. Pointing out to your sister that not even trying to introduce new foods to them is lazy isn't a-hole behavior IMO. Her wanting people to change plans based on a 5 year olds eating habits is bizarre.", "Your sister is out of line for trying to get you to change your plans.", "NTA - your niece doesn\u2019t need to be a higher priority than other friends. You offered her a compromise by letting her bring in food that her child would eat. \n\nMy kids a picky eater too. I get the frustration. I don\u2019t expect people to accommodate by changing the whole menu so my kid can eat something.\n\nYou also didn\u2019t comment about her eating habits until the issue kept being pushed.", "NTA for not changing the party plans.  Megan is TA for demanding it.  You should have left out the further comments.  I was a picky eater myself but not that picky.  When my son was younger, he had a friend who would absolutely only eat chicken nuggets and cheese pizza.  He\u2019s a teenager now and eats like a normal human being.", "NTA \n\nand I don\u2019t get the ESH. Your sister made it into a you problem when she kept demanding you change your daughters birthday plans to accommodate one single person.", "NTA. If there was a diagnosed issue that was being worked on, then Megan would not be an asshole, but the fact that Ruby has not been taken to a doctor to address this is a big problem.", "Nta megan kept pushing, you said no and she kept making it an issue. She needs to address the habits if she isn\u2019t willing to bring her own food.", "NTA \n\nI have an autistic kid with SPD and GDD. He's the definition of fussy. \n\nIf he goes somewhere and they don't have his \"safe\" foods. I bring them. I'm not expecting things to be changed just for him.", "NTA. Um, can we not blame neurodivergence on every time a child does something. Your sister is the problem as she's feeding the picky eater syndrome. What BS. If AVA went to the party and didn't eat, she's hardly going to starve by missing one meal. Besides she might truy it if she sees the other kids eating without mummy running to make sure she has just what she needs.\n\n I had a friend that made 4 different dinners a night for her, her husband and her two kids. Guess what, when the boys came over they simply ate what we served, no arm twisting involved. \n\nIt's not rocket science. You make a dinner for everyone with the expectation this is what we will all eat. Obviously nothing the child hates but a balanced meal.\n\nThat said, the bigger issue is IF there is a possibility that your niece is a neurodivergent then why in the hell isn't your sister doing something?", "NTA.  Your sister wouldn't take no for an answer.  She needed to hear the truth.", "NTA.  She's very pushy and entitled.", "\nNTA\n\nShe should address the cause \n\nMy daughter has SPD and is on the spectrum\u2014 I still introduce new foods to her.  We have a try bite routine.

My child is very much like Ava\u2014with strong sensory issues that limit them to a handful of foods. We would never, ever, expect a change of plans around their needs.", "NAH. I hate armchair psychology, but it might be worth looking into ARFID. It sounds a lot like what she might have.", "ESH \n\nYou\u2019re an asshole for commenting on things that don\u2019t concern you.

This isn\u2019t a matter of who the AH is- it shouldn\u2019t be a competition that way.

If she's healthy then it's fine.", "ESH\n If a kid has food issues, arrange to eat before or after the event. Don't expect that the person hosting is going to warp all plans around it. And this isn't even an allergy or real food issue. \n\nIf a kid eats only one or two foods and is healthy, it is none of your business, and your opinion doesn't matter. If the child is sick, starving, or clearly unhealthy, then you speak or call CPS.", "ESH.\n\nShe shouldn't demand you change settled plans; you shouldn't be dismissive of your niece's needs.

You are an asshole for commenting on her parenting. It is very normal for children to be picky eaters when they are young.", "ESH. Honestly it's quite common for kids that age to be picky eaters, there's nothing weird about it.
