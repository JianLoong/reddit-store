Full disclosure though, I\u2019m coming at this from the angle of an adult who has suffered from ARFID their entire life. \n\nMy mom was often criticized for \u201ccoddling\u201d me because she didn\u2019t force me to eat food I didn\u2019t want to; fast forward 20 years, and the specialists let us know she actually did everything right. \n\nI was given the opportunity to try new food and encouraged to do so, but was never, NEVER forced, and because of that, I didn\u2019t develop the outright fearful relationship with food that many people with this disorder have. My list of safe foods is much larger than it was when I was a child, because I was allowed to set the pace myself and assured that putting fuel in my body was priority one.\n\nAll that being said though, you\u2019ll notice I did cast my vote definitively for you not being the asshole. It sounds like your sister is doing some things right in being kind and patient with her daughter\u2019s needs, but expecting the world to cater to her is unfair.\n\nI have grown up needing to bring my own food to events, and it can be incredibly embarrassing and isolating\u2014 but the fact of the matter is\u2026 you can\u2019t avoid those things. Good people will be understanding, and they\u2019ll help accommodate you! But accommodation is personal. It\u2019s, ideally, something that only affects the person needing it.\n\nI apologize for rambling so long, but I thought this might be a perspective worth sharing with your sister. I hope your niece does grow out of her picky eating. Many children do! But that\u2019s done by gently encouraging them to leave their comfort zone, not by waiting for a magic button to be pressed.", "NTA. Your sister kept pushing it, so what you said was not unwarranted, it was rude of her to tell you to change the plans you'd already made. The other 2 girls being vegetarians is totally normal and I bet they still eat a variety of food, whereas her daughter obviously has some other issue and isn't eating a balanced diet. My oldest child is autistic and it takes a lot to get him to eat different foods, but we have found ways to try and he does eat a balanced diet because I put the work in to finding healthy things he will accept, I don't just cave and say oh well nuggets again and that's it.", "NTA Even asking to change the party, nevermind insisting on it,  is crazy entitled. Her daughter bringing her own food is perfectly reasonable and what most picky eaters do. \n\nThat kid will be fine though and will grow out of it. Its not out of the ordinary for young kids to eat like this and their moms not making every meal a war because of it. If she's getting her regular pediatrician check ups then her doctor would know if there's a major problem with her diet.", "NTA. Adult picky eater here. It started when I started feeding myself as a baby/toddler. I have texture issues and other sensory issues. I don\u2019t really think your niece\u2019s eating issues is your business though. But I wouldn\u2019t have changed my plans either. Just because someone has eating issues/preferences, doesn\u2019t mean the world revolves around them/us. But you can\u2019t force a kid to eat something they don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s gross and can cause eating disorders down the road. Even now, I\u2019ll eat before or after an event if I\u2019m unsure of the food. I don\u2019t like eating around a bunch of people anyways. No big deal. I even carry snacks with me, but that\u2019s more for low blood sugar. I\u2019ve definitely tried more food as an adult, but also lost taste for some food too. Probably should\u2019ve been tested as a kid, but my mom only took me to the doctor if I was sick.", "NTA- and this is coming from a picky eater. Sounds like you bent over backwards to be accommodating. Your sister had no right to put those kind of demands on you and try to change the plans. \nAs for the grow out of it- this sounds different and not a case of picky eating. As you mentioned, she should consult a specialist. Her daughter may be having issues either with texture of food or maybe digesting/swallowing certain food. Her daughter may equate it to \u201ci don\u2019t like that\u201d because she\u2019s young and doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.", "Changing the menu for two kids is okay but not for one? \n\nMy kid was picky (we're all autistic in our house) but that was no one else's problem.

He always had food he would eat, just also happened to have one or two items he wasn't keen on as extras.\n\n17 years on he still won't touch salads but will eat nearly everything else.

Get a start on it asap.", "I\u2019m the picky eater someone raised. I once was sat at a table for over 6 hours for refusing to try a bite of food. Punishment around food doesn\u2019t work. Im glad that you praise instead of punish.", "Omg yes! A tiny scrap of lettuce on a subway sub will destroy it. I once got pizza from a place that does a big mac pizza and there was a tiny piece of lettuce on one slice. I nearly gagged.\n\nIt's funny though because I will eat a salad with iceberg lettuce if it's cold, crunchy and has a very vinegary dressing. But the second it gets hot, it's toxic.", "You know what\u2019s even funnier? Asian family so lots of spices. My parents would lie and say it\u2019s not spicy. So I\u2019d avoid everything red including tomatoes \ud83e\udd23", "I'm autistic, and mostly agree with you. I'm an 80s kid, fussy eating simply wasn't tolerated at that time, so family and school both put a lot of time into undoing my fussy eating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey weren't super strict with me, I had to try at least a few bites of something new on a regular basis, and vegetables had to be finished. Nothing new would be made if I didn't eat everything, so I either ate what they gave me, or went a little hungry until the next meal (this is not dangerous, merely a little uncomfortable, so I don't get why some parents seem to think it's the end of the world).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was also allergy tested though, because I was hospitalised with a dairy allergy when very young, and they did want to make sure that they could differentiate between me merely being fussy, and me avoiding things that would make me ill.", "What you\u2019re describing in this comment is very different from the \u201ceat it or starve\u201d in the first comment.", "This was my approach as well.  I did foster care and the girls at first would eat around 3 things.  I offered those meals with vegetables and gradually added a meal a week.  It was hit or miss, they would love steak one week, hate it the next and if we went out I learned to order them what I wanted to eat and vice versa (if it was on my plate somehow it was yummier)\n\nThey were never easy eaters but we never had to bring food either.  But I never forced and never doused food in sugar so they would eat it.  \n\nI found it was also helpful to serve foods seperate.  Pasta, sauce, ground beef they could combine or not.  Taco shells, cheese, ground beef, lettuce, tomato - they ate what they wanted of those items - sometimes making tacos, sometimes not.", "I\u2019m so sorry you went through something that triggered your pickiness I\u2019m glad things have gotten better, thank you so much for the encouragement", "Literally love you rn thank you so much it really does give me so much hope \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d thank you!", "Sounds like his sister she was so good and now she\u2019s picky too, I can\u2019t even say anything because I\u2019m picky as well \ud83d\ude05", "I\u2019m so sorry you didn\u2019t have anyone in your corner, parents should be a safe space always. I worry mostly because his biggest source of nutrients is mostly pur\u00e9ed veggies and now that he doesn\u2019t want those either it\u2019s a fight to get him to even eat that so it\u2019s always a debate not making mealtime a battle because I\u2019m like  I making it worse? And he isn\u2019t speaking yet either so I don\u2019t know how to communicate to him that he has to have something of sustenance in his stomach", "He\u2019s actually very normal in weight but that\u2019s because after he was done with formula and milk we had to give him basically the equivalent of a toddler protein shake or \u201cnutritional\u201d mix. If it was up to him he would only eat rice crackers", "Weirdly, I only like tomatoes in sauce. Not cooked, i don't like the texture"]}
