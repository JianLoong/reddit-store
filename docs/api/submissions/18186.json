He isn\u2019t exactly low functioning but he\u2019s close. We both are about to finish our junior year of HS and honestly I view him as a burden to my social life.\n\nGrowing up our parents made sure we spent a lot of time together, they\u2019d insist I\u2019d play with Zack, which is his name. He always made it hard for me to make friends because he always acts so clingy to me and utterly embarrassing.\n\nWith online classes from COVID I felt happy because I didn\u2019t always have Zack hovering over me at all times. Ever since we went back to school in person I was reminded how much I hated the way he effected how other people treat me. Whenever friends wanted to hangout my mom would fricken demand I brought him along with me, they\u2019d just stop inviting me to stuff.\n\nToday I wanted to hangout with a girl I like after school and told Zack to walk home. He started screaming and called my mom and she told me I had to either let Zack hangout with us or I\u2019d have to go home. So I decided to just go home.\n\nOn the way home I started screaming at Zack telling him he wasn\u2019t normal and he\u2019s ruining my life! I said we\u2019re done talking when we aren\u2019t at home! He started crying and just sat on the sidewalk having a meltdown. Our mom had to come get him and I\u2019ve been arguing with her saying I\u2019m done with Zack and I\u2019m almost an adult! I\u2019m not wrong here right?!!\n\nTLDR; AITA for not letting my autistic brother hangout with me anymore?\n\nEDIT: I showed my parents this post and told them I\u2019m standing my ground on not having Zack follow me anymore. I\u2019ve also apologized to Zack for blowing up on him but made it clear that I meant what I said about needing him to back off from now on!", "created_utc": 1685060032, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rxw0g/aita_for_refusing_to_hangout_with_my_autistic/", "score": 1755, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Zack is not at fault here though I can understand why you feel resentment towards him.  I think you should talk to your school counselor or a trusted adult. Your mom is the AH for doing this to her children. She needs to seek a coping group so that she understands how to deal with situations and emotions concerning having an autistic child that won\u2019t get to experience social norms. I suspect she is forcing you to let him tag along so that he can experience these social aspects that he otherwise wouldn\u2019t through you. She needs to realize that at some point you will have a life that your brother can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t participate in. Someone needs to wake her up but it\u2019s not your job. You\u2019re young and dealing with a lot emotionally so I don\u2019t blame you for your unfortunate emotional outburst. NTA but please apologize to your brother he\u2019s in just as much a victim in this as you are.", "Everyone gets frustrated sometimes.  Your parents have treated you two as a single person with only one set of needs,  instead of two individual people. \n\nYour parents have failed to consider your needs, and failed to let your brother develop his own skills. \n\nYou were rude to your brother, and for that you should apologize, but NTA.  This has been ten years coming.  And soon your brother isn\u2019t going to have you as a crutch, and they needed to learn it.", "I\u2019m not going to rate this.\n\nYour mom needs to stop parentifying you. It\u2019s a form of emotional abuse. I\u2019m really sorry that she\u2019s putting you through that. It\u2019s not fair to you. You\u2019re just a kid.\n\nWhat you\u2019re feeling isn\u2019t wrong. Don\u2019t take it out on your brother. I\u2019m sure this is painful for him, too\u2014feeling like he always has to be around someone who hates him for something he can\u2019t control. \n\nYour brother knows he\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s not his fault. He isn\u2019t ruining your life. Your emotionally abusive mom is. Please redirect your anger.\n\nEDIT: rereading this and the question is if you\u2019re the asshole for refusing to hang out with your brother: no, you\u2019re NTA for establishing boundaries in your relationship. The fact that you\u2019re in the situation where you even HAVE to do that is so unfair. I was parentified too and I understand how traumatic it can be to miss out on the foundation of an emotionally safe childhood. But please don\u2019t be cruel to your brother. Your mom is the biggest asshole of all and I think it\u2019s understandable that you hit your breaking point, but what you said to your brother was really shitty.", " NTA, but Mom is.  It\u2019s time for her to start getting alternate care for Zack.  There are lots of post high school support through government, especially at the county level- perhaps she (or you, and give her the info) could research help for him now.", "Yes and No: you\u2019re NTA for feeling emotionally exhausted. Your mother has put a lot of unnecessary pressure on you with regards to your brother which has understandably resulted in resentment. Your mother has forced him to be attached to you which has made it difficult for you to grow and find your identity as an individual. You are NTA for speaking up and expressing your truth, or for setting boundaries. \n\nYou are (kind of) the A*hole for saying what you said to your brother. It\u2019s not his fault he is the way he is, and his attachment to you is a manifestation of your mothers actions. He\u2019ll likely internalise what you said and now feel hated by his own twin. I get the outburst was likely secondary to built up emotion, but this could cause a lot of long term damage to your brother and your relationship to him. \n\nYou might have to have a honest convo with your twin and your mother separately about boundaries. At the end of the day those friends may one day show you that they\u2019re disingenuous, fake, and not people that you even want to keep around but your brother will always be your brother. Yes you should have a life separate to him, but it\u2019s hard enough feeling like you\u2019re a burden, let alone being autistic and feeling like your a burden and your own twin hates you. You might have to eventually apologise, not necessarily for what you said (well maybe for some of what you said), but definitely for your delivery.", "This is a very soft ESH\n\nI am a mom to a child with significant developmental disabilities, and I am a twin. The expectation that you be forced to always include your brother doesn\u2019t even make sense for typical twin siblings. You are two separate people. Your mother is absolutely an asshole. I understand that for her it can be incredibly hard to have a child who you know will never be able to experience life like their typical sibling. That life for them is limited, harder, and so many things many take for granted, are completely out of reach.  But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s your responsibility to make up for that. It isn\u2019t fair for your brother to miss out, but it also isn\u2019t fair to only allow you to socialize with him.  \n\nIt\u2019s clear that your mother forcing you two together has created a LOT of resentment and anger.  You are not responsible for that, but you will be responsible for dealing with it in a healthy way as you continue to grow and get older.  \n\nNow, you are an asshole for how you took out your anger on your brother. He didn\u2019t create this expectation. He isn\u2019t responsible for this situation. Your mother is. You find yourself between a rock and a hard place because you aren\u2019t allowed autonomy over your social life. You\u2019re being forced to stay home all the time, or bring your brother, which ends up ruining your time with friends and others.  I suspect if your social and personal identity felt more your own, your anger at your brother being around you at a school wouldn\u2019t feel so suffocating.  But as how things stand, you can not separate yourself from him. Even for typical twins, this would be incredibly hard to deal with and would create the same animosity. \n\nWith all of this, you have your brother stuck in the middle. It isnt his choice that he is being forced on you. And it doesn\u2019t sound like he understands why you are angry or how his presence has created so much resentment.  For him, he sees being with you as his only opportunity to do things all the other kids get to do. He doesn\u2019t understand that putting that expectation on you isn\u2019t fair. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is some jealousy from him mixed in. From his perspective, you denied him the opportunity to get out of the house and have fun. And then yelled at him and blamed him for something he sees as your choice.  I\u2019m also guessing that he doesn\u2019t have the same level of developmental ability to process his emotions as you do. So taking out your anger on him, makes you an asshole, even though your anger is justified.", "NTA your mum is wrong to push him on you. I hope you will understand that it\u2019s not his fault and have a healthier relationship with him when you\u2019re older, when you can chose to spend a more appropriate smaller amount of time together, when you\u2019re not already busy with something else.", "ESH.

That's just horrible.", "ESH.\n\nYou - for yelling at Zack.

She has to understand that in no way or form having your brother join you on your dates is appropriate, and basically, she is just using you to babysit Zack.", "ESH\n\nLook, Zack can't control the way he behaves. That's just the way he is. You, yelling at him, doesn't help at all. You are displacing your frustration on him.\n\nYour mom is putting a bunch of pressure on you even though *she's* the parent.

I think your mom needs to ease up on you and figure out another way to get Zach the socialization he needs. I think you will ultimately regret causing a permanent rift between yourself and your brother, when he\u2019s not doing anything he can really help, even if it feels awful to deal with. It\u2019s also important to consider the kinds of friends you have, if they would rather leave you out of things instead of empathizing with your situation. Easier said than done, but I\u2019d try to find friends who will be there for you even when things suck, not just when it\u2019s easy and fun.

She was more fortunate than you however because as I got older my seizures became less frequent and didn't need to be around someone all the time.

This isn't your autistic brother's fault, he doesn't sound to be high functioning or low functioning. He sounds like he's a level 2, potentially, which could mean that your parents *are* wrongfully parentifying you to set you up to be his caregiver in the future. \n\nI'm not saying this is 100% the case, but I'm also autistic and high-functioning so I'm trying to read the situation out of \"inside\" experience to people who are lower functioning (please don't take this as an insult, I couldn't find a better way to word it) but your anger should be directed to your parents over your brother. \n\nAs far as he's concerned, yes he does need to be held to some accountability but I don't know for sure what he struggles with or what level he's been diagnosed under so I'll leave that part there. He does, however, probably not realize why you resent him like the other comment above stated. \n\nHe might idolize you because as the other comment also said, you could be his gateway to a \"normal\" social life. He can be included! It probably feels wonderful for him to be included in normal things. Take it from someone who got autism stereotyped, it doesn't feel good for people to exclude you because of your diagnosis or how it presents itself. \n\nI also wouldn't be too harsh on him over a meltdown, you don't understand how his brain works. He could've been going through a number of overwhelming emotions with the genuine inability to express that you blaming him hurt him. It took me years of therapy to be able to properly verbally express why I was upset/what made me upset, and I wouldn't be surprised if this regulation is a skill he lacks. Sometimes, those of us on the spectrum can't put it into words until it has passed, it could be debilitating. \n\nAll in all, I don't think you're in the wrong for being angry, but I do believe your \"stand\" with your parents is going to cause more tension for everyone. Your brother doesn't deserve the treatment just as much as you don't deserve parentification. Your brother also doesn't deserve to lose you over it, I'd suggest potentially creating an ultimatum of you receiving therapy (trust me, it could be good for you), your own space when requested, etc whatever you need in order to not resent him and even potentially isolating yourself to give yourself a break before you allow him to tag along with you.\n\nIt should be your choice, but please understand that he isn't in the wrong.

What does she hope to accomplish? Start a dialogue. She may not realize that it's having the opposite effect she intends. Ask if you can compromise, maybe you take him sometimes but not every time.  If that doesn't work, tell her you want to talk to a therapist or confide in a trusted adult. They could help advocate for you while you speak to your mother. \n\nYou're NTA because you're in an impossible situation, and it's beginning to affect your ability to form meaning friendship at time in your life when you need it most. Your brother needs it too, but you're not equipped to help him.", "NTA. Your mom sucks. What makes it worse to me is that he *is* functional, just severely socially awkward. Not that it would EVER be OK for your mother to force you to take care of your brother, but there's no real need for him to have a babysitter anyway. Your mother is ruining him by giving in to his tantrums. I'd highly recommend putting a lot of distance between you and then when you turn 18.", "Or just don't do it.", "He totally knows he's getting OP yelled at by calling Mom", "Op could mean that they\u2019re in the same school but different classes. Many mainstream schools are capable of catering to students with a variety of needs or have special Ed classrooms for students who may not be able to have their needs met in a regular classroom.", "No I'm sure the parents had everything intention of sending op and zack to the same community college, enrolling them in the same courses and making them share and apartment...that they will pay for BECAUSE they expect op to be grateful and conform to their assigned roll of keeper. NTA. Even sugar has a boiling point.", "I gather ND is Neurodivergent, but what does NT mean?\n\nEDIT: Okay, NT means neurotypical. Thanks, everyone. It also reminds me that I'm used to saying neurodivergent, but my ex often said neuroAtypical", "There was a British TV series ages ago that this made me think of.  A woman had a blind sister.  Their parents had made her spend all her time taking her sister around, describing everything that was going on, telling her about how beautiful things were, until... beauty had become a chore.  Nothing to be happy about.  So later, the woman rebels against her parents and is accused of terrible crimes.  The police bring her parents in to talk to her, and she just barks at them. Because they made a guide dog out of her.", "Seriously I prefer ND kids as a ND. NTs confuse me, and are boring.", "Please do stand your ground. He is not your responsibility. There\u2019s one way to make sure siblings hate being around each other and that\u2019s forcing them to do so. No matter the circumstances. I always hated when my ex wife would scream at our kids and force the older ones to play for hours with the younger ones. The older they get the bigger the age gaps seem when it comes to socialization. Similar with other disabilities as my youngest is autistic too. And you know what?  My kids make plenty of time to play with their little sis and have real fun when they do because it\u2019s on their time and their choice. When they choose not to then it\u2019s on me and that\u2019s okay because kids should be doing age appropriate activities. One day your mom will wonder why you never talk to her. Keep copies of this if you ever do decide to respond.", "Also they need to have backup care for him , else they will have you be his permanent guardian once they are old.", "Your parents are probably *livid* because they can no longer bully you into being your brothers lense into the world, and they look like assholes to the internet. They probably feel like assholes too. \n\nI'm assuming your parents didn't intend to harm your social life or create this shitty dynamic between two siblings; but they did. I'm sure they were working with the best ideas they had and are now offended to see that it didn't work; and their son kind of resents them and the brother in the process. (Does your brother seek any therapy with your parents? They might learn some more beneficial skills for relationship building/maintaining with Zach if they do.) In the nicest way possible; your Mom needs to take more responsibility in regard to Zach. \n\nThis whole situation sucks.", "Please do and I am happy to speak to your parents on your behalf. \n\nI am a mother to severely disabled 15 year old son and I have always made sure my other two children were always able to be their own people with their own interests and friendship groups. Never is it my younger children\u2019s responsibility to be my oldest son\u2019s emotional punchbag or social worker. It is not your job to be your brother\u2019s support worker and your parents/mum should be absolutely ashamed of themselves/herself and I am more than happy to tell her that to her face. \n\nYou are not here to provide your brother with the life your mum wants. It\u2019s your mum\u2019s responsibility to give you the ability to be the best version of yourself possible.", "Me to", "And there I was thinking of escaped parentification and then I read your thing. And suddenly I realized that I was my mum's therapist as a teenager too. I know way too many details about my parents romantic and sex life. \n\nHot tip: do not use your child to unburden yourself of your troubles in the marital bed. Talk to a friend of a threat, but never your child.", "This resonates. I get it though. Humans can't really do years alone without talking to someone and she didn't have a lot of support.", "My younger brother is 43 and has weaponized his aneurotypical behavior since he was a small child. \n\nIt is ableist af to pretend aneurotypical people are all nice and innocent at all times. They are fully able to have selfish agendas, be manipulative, and behave knowingly badly.", "He\u2019s a teenager. He\u2019s acted incredibly well until this point and I don\u2019t blame him at all for what he said. It\u2019s years of built up frustration of it being listened to.", "This is because your parents didn't properly help socialize your brother. Or help him with his emotional regulation needs. There are classes, programs, and after-school groups specifically for autistic kids to learn these skills. Plus there are daily activities and parenting strategies that parents can do from a young age to help guide his social and emotional awareness.\n\nIt sounds like they made you responsible for these things from a young age. Anyone, regardless of their neurological type, is going to do poorly if they are only guided by another child. Last I heard children are notoriously inexperienced at practicing and teaching developmental emotional and social skills to anyone.", "It sucks because Zack is clearly very capable and has loads of potential. The way your parents are approaching this is unhelpful to both of you, and will impact you both, now and in the future.  \n\nHopefully you and your parents will read the comments here and take some of the useful advice/info on board. And have conversations with Zack about it.  \n\nI agree with others saying that the way you treated your bro in that situation was rude and unfair, and I think you should probs apologise - if you mean it.. if you don\u2019t, question why that is\u2026 But this entire situation & environment your parents have created for you and Zack and themselves is unfair on everyone and I hope some changes can be made, for all of your sakes    \n  \n  \n\nEdited grammar, changed Zach to Zack", "Thank you. My brother didn't figure out that doesn't work on anybody except our mom until he spent several years in prison. \n\nHe's on the spectrum. He's also totally capable of telling the difference between right and wrong. And the actual crimes he committed that landed him in jail for several years were so sophisticated that the legal system did not care he's on the spectrum. \n\nOP is NTA in any way, shape, or form.", "Oh 1000% as another commentor said too I wouldn't be surprised if he's faking some of the meltdowns as well because he knows then he'll get his way. It really just makes me sad because both brothers are being failed by their parents.", "Exactly this. What teen says to themselves \"oh boy, I hope my friend/crush has his severely mentally handicapped and socially inappropriate brother come with him every time we hang out/go on a date\"? Or for that matter, what adult would?", "Yep. It hurts both the NT and ND children and as we see here also keeps them from creating a real relationship without all the baggage around it. Where they could have support instead of force bonding.", "Neurotypical", "Neurotypical", "If I\u2019ve used the wrong term, I apologize, I was going by my neuro divergent friends\u2019 preferred terminology b", "New Type. It\u2019s the next step in human evolution where people can communicate great distances using there mind. They can also control giant mechs and use weapons.

I have a daughter who has pretty obvious ADHD. She was also abused by her biomom into some really messed up behaviour (her mom let her do whatever she wanted because she was \"severely disabled\"). When she was in elementary and middle school everyone treated her like a charity case, like giving her a pass made them great, inclusive, and understanding people. It almost destroyed her life.\n\nBecause she knows that she's doing horrible things and getting away with it. Then she started hating herself and everyone else. They were all idiots to her, and she was the monster who took advantage of them.\n\nI'm still so angry that this happened to her. I felt so terrible all the time when I had to discipline her while random people judged me as too harsh. But she was physically hurting other kids, and stealing from people, and using people to feel good about herself and get what she wanted in the moment. Just like how all of them were treating her. They didn't care about her, they only cared about how they looked by being nice and accepting of literally anything she did.", "It's really easy to empathise and excuse someone when it's not you who has to live with them.", "He who describes others, - is most often describing himself.", "Not Terrific.

Good day.", "It's possible to be manipulative and autistic at the same time", "So sorry to hear that. It\u2019s tragic that shit like this happens because people are so wrapped up in feeling morally superior that they forget that enforcing discipline/boundaries/consequences is as important as respect, affection, and emotional support. If you truly love someone why would you want to set them up for catastrophic failure later in life by neglecting to enforce rules?", "Nah I have empathy for all, hard trait and not one I can always follow because it is hard for me too. Also in another comment after getting more info I did change my mind.", "So many people refuse to acknowledge this."]}
