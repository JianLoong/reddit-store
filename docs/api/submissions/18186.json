He isn\u2019t exactly low functioning but he\u2019s close. We both are about to finish our junior year of HS and honestly I view him as a burden to my social life.\n\nGrowing up our parents made sure we spent a lot of time together, they\u2019d insist I\u2019d play with Zack, which is his name. He always made it hard for me to make friends because he always acts so clingy to me and utterly embarrassing.\n\nWith online classes from COVID I felt happy because I didn\u2019t always have Zack hovering over me at all times. Ever since we went back to school in person I was reminded how much I hated the way he effected how other people treat me. Whenever friends wanted to hangout my mom would fricken demand I brought him along with me, they\u2019d just stop inviting me to stuff.\n\nToday I wanted to hangout with a girl I like after school and told Zack to walk home. He started screaming and called my mom and she told me I had to either let Zack hangout with us or I\u2019d have to go home. So I decided to just go home.\n\nOn the way home I started screaming at Zack telling him he wasn\u2019t normal and he\u2019s ruining my life! I said we\u2019re done talking when we aren\u2019t at home! He started crying and just sat on the sidewalk having a meltdown. Our mom had to come get him and I\u2019ve been arguing with her saying I\u2019m done with Zack and I\u2019m almost an adult! I\u2019m not wrong here right?!!\n\nTLDR; AITA for not letting my autistic brother hangout with me anymore?\n\nEDIT: I showed my parents this post and told them I\u2019m standing my ground on not having Zack follow me anymore. I\u2019ve also apologized to Zack for blowing up on him but made it clear that I meant what I said about needing him to back off from now on!", "created_utc": 1685060032, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rxw0g/aita_for_refusing_to_hangout_with_my_autistic/", "score": 780, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Zack is not at fault here though I can understand why you feel resentment towards him.  I think you should talk to your school counselor or a trusted adult. Your mom is the AH for doing this to her children. She needs to seek a coping group so that she understands how to deal with situations and emotions concerning having an autistic child that won\u2019t get to experience social norms. I suspect she is forcing you to let him tag along so that he can experience these social aspects that he otherwise wouldn\u2019t through you. She needs to realize that at some point you will have a life that your brother can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t participate in. Someone needs to wake her up but it\u2019s not your job. You\u2019re young and dealing with a lot emotionally so I don\u2019t blame you for your unfortunate emotional outburst. NTA but please apologize to your brother he\u2019s in just as much a victim in this as you are.", "Everyone gets frustrated sometimes.  Your parents have treated you two as a single person with only one set of needs,  instead of two individual people. \n\nYour parents have failed to consider your needs, and failed to let your brother develop his own skills. \n\nYou were rude to your brother, and for that you should apologize, but NTA.  This has been ten years coming.  And soon your brother isn\u2019t going to have you as a crutch, and they needed to learn it.", "I\u2019m not going to rate this.\n\nYour mom needs to stop parentifying you. It\u2019s a form of emotional abuse. I\u2019m really sorry that she\u2019s putting you through that. It\u2019s not fair to you. You\u2019re just a kid.\n\nWhat you\u2019re feeling isn\u2019t wrong. Don\u2019t take it out on your brother. I\u2019m sure this is painful for him, too\u2014feeling like he always has to be around someone who hates him for something he can\u2019t control. \n\nYour brother knows he\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s not his fault. He isn\u2019t ruining your life. Your emotionally abusive mom is. Please redirect your anger.\n\nEDIT: rereading this and the question is if you\u2019re the asshole for refusing to hang out with your brother: no, you\u2019re NTA for establishing boundaries in your relationship. The fact that you\u2019re in the situation where you even HAVE to do that is so unfair. I was parentified too and I understand how traumatic it can be to miss out on the foundation of an emotionally safe childhood. But please don\u2019t be cruel to your brother. Your mom is the biggest asshole of all and I think it\u2019s understandable that you hit your breaking point, but what you said to your brother was really shitty.", " NTA, but Mom is.  It\u2019s time for her to start getting alternate care for Zack.  There are lots of post high school support through government, especially at the county level- perhaps she (or you, and give her the info) could research help for him now.", "Yes and No: you\u2019re NTA for feeling emotionally exhausted. Your mother has put a lot of unnecessary pressure on you with regards to your brother which has understandably resulted in resentment. Your mother has forced him to be attached to you which has made it difficult for you to grow and find your identity as an individual. You are NTA for speaking up and expressing your truth, or for setting boundaries. \n\nYou are (kind of) the A*hole for saying what you said to your brother. It\u2019s not his fault he is the way he is, and his attachment to you is a manifestation of your mothers actions. He\u2019ll likely internalise what you said and now feel hated by his own twin. I get the outburst was likely secondary to built up emotion, but this could cause a lot of long term damage to your brother and your relationship to him. \n\nYou might have to have a honest convo with your twin and your mother separately about boundaries. At the end of the day those friends may one day show you that they\u2019re disingenuous, fake, and not people that you even want to keep around but your brother will always be your brother. Yes you should have a life separate to him, but it\u2019s hard enough feeling like you\u2019re a burden, let alone being autistic and feeling like your a burden and your own twin hates you. You might have to eventually apologise, not necessarily for what you said (well maybe for some of what you said), but definitely for your delivery.", "This is a very soft ESH\n\nI am a mom to a child with significant developmental disabilities, and I am a twin. The expectation that you be forced to always include your brother doesn\u2019t even make sense for typical twin siblings. You are two separate people. Your mother is absolutely an asshole. I understand that for her it can be incredibly hard to have a child who you know will never be able to experience life like their typical sibling. That life for them is limited, harder, and so many things many take for granted, are completely out of reach.  But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s your responsibility to make up for that. It isn\u2019t fair for your brother to miss out, but it also isn\u2019t fair to only allow you to socialize with him.  \n\nIt\u2019s clear that your mother forcing you two together has created a LOT of resentment and anger.  You are not responsible for that, but you will be responsible for dealing with it in a healthy way as you continue to grow and get older.  \n\nNow, you are an asshole for how you took out your anger on your brother. He didn\u2019t create this expectation. He isn\u2019t responsible for this situation. Your mother is. You find yourself between a rock and a hard place because you aren\u2019t allowed autonomy over your social life. You\u2019re being forced to stay home all the time, or bring your brother, which ends up ruining your time with friends and others.  I suspect if your social and personal identity felt more your own, your anger at your brother being around you at a school wouldn\u2019t feel so suffocating.  But as how things stand, you can not separate yourself from him. Even for typical twins, this would be incredibly hard to deal with and would create the same animosity. \n\nWith all of this, you have your brother stuck in the middle. It isnt his choice that he is being forced on you. And it doesn\u2019t sound like he understands why you are angry or how his presence has created so much resentment.  For him, he sees being with you as his only opportunity to do things all the other kids get to do. He doesn\u2019t understand that putting that expectation on you isn\u2019t fair. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is some jealousy from him mixed in. From his perspective, you denied him the opportunity to get out of the house and have fun. And then yelled at him and blamed him for something he sees as your choice.  I\u2019m also guessing that he doesn\u2019t have the same level of developmental ability to process his emotions as you do. So taking out your anger on him, makes you an asshole, even though your anger is justified.", "NTA your mum is wrong to push him on you. I hope you will understand that it\u2019s not his fault and have a healthier relationship with him when you\u2019re older, when you can chose to spend a more appropriate smaller amount of time together, when you\u2019re not already busy with something else.", "ESH.

She has to understand that in no way or form having your brother join you on your dates is appropriate, and basically, she is just using you to babysit Zack.", "ESH\n\nLook, Zack can't control the way he behaves.

I think you will ultimately regret causing a permanent rift between yourself and your brother, when he\u2019s not doing anything he can really help, even if it feels awful to deal with. It\u2019s also important to consider the kinds of friends you have, if they would rather leave you out of things instead of empathizing with your situation. Easier said than done, but I\u2019d try to find friends who will be there for you even when things suck, not just when it\u2019s easy and fun.

This isn't your autistic brother's fault, he doesn't sound to be high functioning or low functioning. He sounds like he's a level 2, potentially, which could mean that your parents *are* wrongfully parentifying you to set you up to be his caregiver in the future. \n\nI'm not saying this is 100% the case, but I'm also autistic and high-functioning so I'm trying to read the situation out of \"inside\" experience to people who are lower functioning (please don't take this as an insult, I couldn't find a better way to word it) but your anger should be directed to your parents over your brother. \n\nAs far as he's concerned, yes he does need to be held to some accountability but I don't know for sure what he struggles with or what level he's been diagnosed under so I'll leave that part there. He does, however, probably not realize why you resent him like the other comment above stated. \n\nHe might idolize you because as the other comment also said, you could be his gateway to a \"normal\" social life. He can be included! It probably feels wonderful for him to be included in normal things. Take it from someone who got autism stereotyped, it doesn't feel good for people to exclude you because of your diagnosis or how it presents itself. \n\nI also wouldn't be too harsh on him over a meltdown, you don't understand how his brain works. He could've been going through a number of overwhelming emotions with the genuine inability to express that you blaming him hurt him. It took me years of therapy to be able to properly verbally express why I was upset/what made me upset, and I wouldn't be surprised if this regulation is a skill he lacks. Sometimes, those of us on the spectrum can't put it into words until it has passed, it could be debilitating. \n\nAll in all, I don't think you're in the wrong for being angry, but I do believe your \"stand\" with your parents is going to cause more tension for everyone. Your brother doesn't deserve the treatment just as much as you don't deserve parentification. Your brother also doesn't deserve to lose you over it, I'd suggest potentially creating an ultimatum of you receiving therapy (trust me, it could be good for you), your own space when requested, etc whatever you need in order to not resent him and even potentially isolating yourself to give yourself a break before you allow him to tag along with you.\n\nIt should be your choice, but please understand that he isn't in the wrong.

It'll do him some good in the longrun to find out ways to enjoy himself without you around, maybe even make his own friends. Especially since you'll eventually be out of the house living your own life, and Zack needs to have the skills to cope with it when it happens.\n\nWishing the best for you and your brother.", "One more thing, just looked it up, in my area they have an autism society with a  young adults (ages 16-20) social skills group. Looks like it's got both games and some life skills courses. Your parents could look into something like that for your brother so he can have his own space and make friends in a setting unconnected to you.", "Sometimes it\u2019s a case of \u201cI stand by what I said, but not the way I said it\u201d", "Best wishes. I hope without your parents  forcing you to spend time together abs invading your personal life, that you and Zach can find your own one-on-one relationship that you both enjoy.", "Do you have access to therapy or at least a school counselor? Its always good to have someone who isnt a family member to talk to and help you through stuff like this.", "That\u2019s not the question that we\u2019re judging though. OP asked if he\u2019s an asshole for refusing to hang out with his brother. Which he\u2019s not. It might be OP\u2019s responsibility to manage his words and actions, but he never should\u2019ve been put in this position to begin with.", "I\u2019m going NTA here. OP is a teenager trying to negotiate high school life and you can only expect so much sensitivity from a person who has been pushed that far for so long. Their mom should absolutely not be forcing him to take Zack with him everywhere. And frankly I\u2019d go a step further, while he should absolutely treat Zack with respect he shouldn\u2019t be forced to be friends with him. You aren\u2019t required to like your family and trying to force the issue only harms both OP and Zack. Sucks for Zack, his handicap is unfair but it\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility either and with the amount of built up resentment and frustration the damage to their relationship may well be permanent.", "That doesn't really make sense IMO, part of what was said is that OP doesn't want to be Zack's unpaid carer anymore - that's valid.\n\nHe could say it in a nicer way, but there are plenty of good reasons, far beyond just excuses, for the meat of what OP said.\n\nSeriously, he pushes back at being an unpaid carer and he just gets blamed...?", "I doubt if op's mom is going to pay for college whether they stay or go.  Either way, I think it's not a factor here.   Op's mom doesn't gain anything if op goes to college at all, rather the opposite.  She wins if they don't and stay around to keep parenting bro.", "Me too", "What happens when you refuse to let him hang around at school?", "I still stand by your parents completely fobbing him off on you. They are very likely to try to force you to take him with you when you eventually move out. He is NOT your responsibility, though, please remember that.", "Sooo much this. If he's able to walk home alone, go to \"regular\" school, etc. then his brother has to take some responsibility for this situation too. Being autistic does not give him a pass to act this way. Especially when he's almost an adult.\n\nIt's more so his parents fault for creating this situation in the first place though. It very much seems like they don't want to deal with the brother at all and just shove him on op. \n\nWhat op said wasn't the nicest but it's justified in my mind. Nta op.", "Fair point, I just think saying he isn't normal might've been too far.", "This is exactly what came to my mind!!!!", "That\u2019s not fair, why should they be obligated to spend time with someone they find annoying or offensive? It\u2019s also not great for the disabled person if people only hang out with them out of guilt. \n\nHad two fairly severely autistic kids I went to middle school with. One was a giant (6\u20194\u201d as a 7th grader) who would constantly pick fights because he was so much bigger than anyone else. Yet when he blindsided me in the side of the head out of nowhere and I beat the shit out of him I got in trouble because \u201che doesn\u2019t know better.\u201d still pissed about that two decades later. And the other little bastard was even worse. He\u2019d intentionally install malware on school computers and then tell teachers other kids did it or worst of all: he\u2019d grab girls\u2019 chests (13-14yo girls!) and \u201crate\u201d them. The whole student body hated him but we\u2019d be forced to put up with him because \u201cthat\u2019s just the way he is\u201d and excluding the little sicko would be \u201cbullying\u201d\n\nFuck that noise. As an adult I hold everyone to the same standards. Treat everyone with respect and if you are incapable of respecting others\u2019 boundaries you should face repercussions for crossing those lines. When I have a kid I will be instilling in them that they while bullying is never tolerated, not wanting to associate with people with incompatible personalities is not bullying and they shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for not wanting to be around someone they dislike or makes them uncomfortable", "If this is an ongoing issue that has been discussed a bunch, then you need to really get it through your parents\u2019 heads that they are enabling him and infantilizing him, and in doing so, he knows he can weaponize it. The situation sucks for both of you, and your parents letting it continue is not okay.\n\nHe needs to learn how to make other friends. It\u2019s entirely possible he doesn\u2019t know how, and your parents might need to help him figure that out rather than him just being told to do that. Can he join an after school club that relates to his interest(s)? That is probably the best way for him to find friends with whom he has something in common. I definitely think you need space to breathe, and he deserves to have friends who want to be around him. Tensions are high between you two right now and it\u2019s totally understandable that you could only take so much. Good luck.", "I think it\u2019s difficult to place blame on Zack when your mother has turned you into his safety blanket. Instead of your mom teaching Zack how to have coping skills to do things without you, she\u2019s made you his coping mechanism. \n\nZack might realize you\u2019re upset when he\u2019s with you but he may not realize it\u2019s because he\u2019s always with you. Even if you were to tell him you wanted space, that is probably confusing when your mom keeps telling him he should be with you. It might be difficult for him to understand situations like this when your mother keeps undermining your right to live your own life whenever you try. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to teach him how to cope without you or be his cruise director for life. Your parents need to step up. But it\u2019s hard to place blame on him for a situation your parents created", "you change the way you talk about Zach a few times (you start out with him barely above \u201clow functioning\u201d but then subsequent descriptions give him more credit), but it\u2019s very possible that he needs to be taught those social skills explicitly. Perspective taking (understanding your frustrations), making friends, navigating social cues are all skills that can be harder for a neurodivergent person to understand. If he\u2019s flown under the radar for services (such as speech/language therapy) because he \u201cfunctions\u201d without behavior challenges, he may have missed out on therapy and coaching that can help build those skills.\n\nYour mom refusing to treat him as his own person is not helping him any, but it would also help if you recognized that these things aren\u2019t going to be as natural for him to learn compared to how they are for you. Your frustration is valid, I\u2019m just trying to give you some foundation to understand the opposite side. You might sit down as a family (with zack!) to discuss if some social language therapy or coaching could be pursued. Because there will definitely come a time when zack will be on his own and he will need these skills and know how to advocate for himself.", "From this POV looks like you have 0 empathy for your brother, and for some reason you expect empathy from him?\n\nBlaming Zack would be like blaming a child for something they had 0 clue about when it\u2019s the parent\u2019s responsibility to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen. Is he\u2019s smart or mature enough to know, or not (question repeated down below)\n\nZack gets upset when you tell him to leave you alone because he probably feel lonely. Idk if he has friends or anyone he hangs out with, but that\u2019s how it is. I do agree it isn\u2019t fair to burden this onto you, especially when it seems to make him codependent. Same time, empathy goes a long way and if you end up going to therapy and having better mental health in the future, you will likely see that Zack did little to nothing wrong, especially if he really knows no better. \n\nPerhaps help him make friends or hang out occasionally while setting boundaries. Ofc you don\u2019t have to, but you would have to be heartless to let your brother be alone after your parents and other family pass away, so the little help you can and are willing to provide would be a godsend for him. Again, baby steps, take your time and only do what you are comfortable doing. Even if it\u2019s just helping him sign up for an after school club (you don\u2019t have to be a part of the club, just tell him it exists and if you want to give the push to sign up based on his interests).\n\nAlso I noticed you got extra mad this time because of a girl. While I do understand that, remember humans live till 70-90 years at least if they are healthy and no complications come up. Missing an opportunity for dating or whatever one time isn\u2019t going to forever ruin your life even if it feels like in the present as the worst timing and feeling ever. \n\nOk so if you\u2019re willing to answer these questions please do:\n\nDoes Zack have other friends?\n\nAre you on the spectrum at all?\n\nDo you realize when a child does something terrible and they don\u2019t know no better, the parents are to blame not the child? And if Zack is as autistic or on the spectrum as you say he his, he may have the emotional maturity and intelligence of a child? (If not please explain then).", "What makes you think I haven\u2019t.", "My sister and I (both undiagnosed ND) were raised in a similar way. Even though I was younger, we ended up in the same grade and I was manipulated or straight up ordered to look after her. Fortunately for me she's a quiet and pleasant person to be around, but its still inhibiting to have your older sibling in your friend group and leaving her at home made me feel guilty if it was going to be a bunch of us anyway. She had friends of her own in elementary school, even when I didn't, but when high school rolled around she just sort of tagged along with me everywhere and never needed to make friends of her own.\n\nAt around 40, she's still pretty dependent on me. We each have a kid the same age who are very similar to us each in personality and ability, and she and her kids live in my basement. We purposely sent our kids to different schools so that they wouldn't fall into the same trap we were shoved into. My sister still has like zero friends she hangs out with unless she's hanging with me and my friends.", "As someone who really needed this buffer for adulthood and didn't get it,  this is the way.", "Zach isn't a manipulative brat, he's _autistic_.  When the authority figure says, and the current structure is, that OP is supposed to bring Zach along, actions that deviate from that script can be hugely upsetting to Zach.\n\nPart of _mom's_ (along with the rest of Zach's care team) job is to help Zach learn to navigate the world when the unexpected happens, and to give Zach the tools to self-soothe and find a way back to his routine when it's interrupted.\n\nFor example, if the parents had been fostering a healthier relationship between OP and Zach, acceptable responses to \"I want to hang out with a girl after school today\" might have looked like \"You've already agreed to walk your brother home from school.  Maybe plan for another day and we'll make other arrangements for Zach to get home OR walk Zach home first then go back out and meet the girl afterward.\"\n\nBut those kinds of scenarios only work when Zach and OP have already had spaces to be their own people apart from each other and the parents weren't foisting all the social responsibility off on OP.", "Or, OP is forced to go to the same college as his brother so OP can continue being the parent for him", "In that case I hope the horrible mom loses.", "Question 1: Zack has a couple of friends he plays video games with and there\u2019s one kid he hangs out with sometimes.\n\nQuestion 2: I am not on the spectrum. \n\nQuestion3: his autism hasn\u2019t limited his mental capabilities when it comes to training or ability to come to the same school as me and he gets decent grades. He\u2019s just so unbelievably bad at talking and being able to read the room. He acts weird and just lurks around people. He can be very rude and self centered sometimes and just is very unlikable to be honest. When he doesn\u2019t get his way he yells and cries and when you do give him what he wants he acts like it was owed to him in the first place. \n\nI should\u2019ve given more description about him in the post because a lot of people are talking like he\u2019s severely disabled but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s just really autistic acting and won\u2019t leave me alone. And when I tell him to leave me alone he\u2019ll just say stuff like \u201cyou can\u2019t make me\u201d or \u201cno I have nowhere else to go\u201d and it makes my friends and I super uncomfortable and he doesn\u2019t care", "or enlists i the military", "he really would benefit from social language therapy or coaching. not, like, learning to have an artificial conversation, but understanding perspectives, handling rejection, making genuine friendships, establishing boundaries, etc.", ">When he doesn\u2019t get his way he yells and cries and when you do give him what he wants he acts like it was owed to him in the first place. \n\n\nYeah, I can see that. It's like he was owed someone to walk home with, doesn't matter what happens to anyone else, he is owed this.\n\nThen crying and refusing to move until your mum came.\n\nIf your mum keeps pushing him to spend more time with you, I'd keep making him cry until mum comes. Eventually mum will stop pushing the two of you together.", "Thank you for these answers, really changes what I thought ngl\n\nIn that case I do believe you were too harsh on Zack but your parents are the most to blame. Also a please and etc goes a long way, but if, again, you are already doing that, ignore this advice for manners.\n\nOverall life wise NTA, for this specific incident tho, ESH because of how you handles it with Zack.\n\nEdit: Have you ever gotten checked for the spectrum? Like more than once/after elementary school? If so then ignore this\n\nAlso are you sure those people are his friends? Or just people that tolerate him\u2026. Maybe he has no close friends\n\n\nEdit2: The show Atypical handles family dynamics when there is an autistic son really well imo and just a good show overall. Might hit to close to home but it shows good examples of what to do for parents, siblings (Zack and you), life and friends of both of you. Good Luck and keep up the boundaries while trying your best at not using harmful words even if a person in your opinion deserves it. As in the end of the day it hurts you too mentally vs not letting the anger and emotions take over."]}
