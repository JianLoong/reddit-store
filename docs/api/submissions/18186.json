He isn\u2019t exactly low functioning but he\u2019s close. We both are about to finish our junior year of HS and honestly I view him as a burden to my social life.\n\nGrowing up our parents made sure we spent a lot of time together, they\u2019d insist I\u2019d play with Zack, which is his name. He always made it hard for me to make friends because he always acts so clingy to me and utterly embarrassing.\n\nWith online classes from COVID I felt happy because I didn\u2019t always have Zack hovering over me at all times. Ever since we went back to school in person I was reminded how much I hated the way he effected how other people treat me. Whenever friends wanted to hangout my mom would fricken demand I brought him along with me, they\u2019d just stop inviting me to stuff.\n\nToday I wanted to hangout with a girl I like after school and told Zack to walk home. He started screaming and called my mom and she told me I had to either let Zack hangout with us or I\u2019d have to go home. So I decided to just go home.\n\nOn the way home I started screaming at Zack telling him he wasn\u2019t normal and he\u2019s ruining my life! I said we\u2019re done talking when we aren\u2019t at home! He started crying and just sat on the sidewalk having a meltdown. Our mom had to come get him and I\u2019ve been arguing with her saying I\u2019m done with Zack and I\u2019m almost an adult! I\u2019m not wrong here right?!!\n\nTLDR; AITA for not letting my autistic brother hangout with me anymore?\n\nEDIT: I showed my parents this post and told them I\u2019m standing my ground on not having Zack follow me anymore. I\u2019ve also apologized to Zack for blowing up on him but made it clear that I meant what I said about needing him to back off from now on!", "created_utc": 1685060032, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rxw0g/aita_for_refusing_to_hangout_with_my_autistic/", "score": 4899, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Zack is not at fault here though I can understand why you feel resentment towards him.  I think you should talk to your school counselor or a trusted adult. Your mom is the AH for doing this to her children. She needs to seek a coping group so that she understands how to deal with situations and emotions concerning having an autistic child that won\u2019t get to experience social norms. I suspect she is forcing you to let him tag along so that he can experience these social aspects that he otherwise wouldn\u2019t through you. She needs to realize that at some point you will have a life that your brother can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t participate in. Someone needs to wake her up but it\u2019s not your job. You\u2019re young and dealing with a lot emotionally so I don\u2019t blame you for your unfortunate emotional outburst. NTA but please apologize to your brother he\u2019s in just as much a victim in this as you are.", "Everyone gets frustrated sometimes.  Your parents have treated you two as a single person with only one set of needs,  instead of two individual people. \n\nYour parents have failed to consider your needs, and failed to let your brother develop his own skills. \n\nYou were rude to your brother, and for that you should apologize, but NTA.  This has been ten years coming.  And soon your brother isn\u2019t going to have you as a crutch, and they needed to learn it.", "I\u2019m not going to rate this.\n\nYour mom needs to stop parentifying you. It\u2019s a form of emotional abuse. I\u2019m really sorry that she\u2019s putting you through that. It\u2019s not fair to you. You\u2019re just a kid.\n\nWhat you\u2019re feeling isn\u2019t wrong. Don\u2019t take it out on your brother. I\u2019m sure this is painful for him, too\u2014feeling like he always has to be around someone who hates him for something he can\u2019t control. \n\nYour brother knows he\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s not his fault. He isn\u2019t ruining your life. Your emotionally abusive mom is. Please redirect your anger.\n\nEDIT: rereading this and the question is if you\u2019re the asshole for refusing to hang out with your brother: no, you\u2019re NTA for establishing boundaries in your relationship. The fact that you\u2019re in the situation where you even HAVE to do that is so unfair. I was parentified too and I understand how traumatic it can be to miss out on the foundation of an emotionally safe childhood. But please don\u2019t be cruel to your brother. Your mom is the biggest asshole of all and I think it\u2019s understandable that you hit your breaking point, but what you said to your brother was really shitty.", " NTA, but Mom is.  It\u2019s time for her to start getting alternate care for Zack.  There are lots of post high school support through government, especially at the county level- perhaps she (or you, and give her the info) could research help for him now.", "Yes and No: you\u2019re NTA for feeling emotionally exhausted. Your mother has put a lot of unnecessary pressure on you with regards to your brother which has understandably resulted in resentment. Your mother has forced him to be attached to you which has made it difficult for you to grow and find your identity as an individual. You are NTA for speaking up and expressing your truth, or for setting boundaries. \n\nYou are (kind of) the A*hole for saying what you said to your brother. It\u2019s not his fault he is the way he is, and his attachment to you is a manifestation of your mothers actions. He\u2019ll likely internalise what you said and now feel hated by his own twin. I get the outburst was likely secondary to built up emotion, but this could cause a lot of long term damage to your brother and your relationship to him. \n\nYou might have to have a honest convo with your twin and your mother separately about boundaries. At the end of the day those friends may one day show you that they\u2019re disingenuous, fake, and not people that you even want to keep around but your brother will always be your brother. Yes you should have a life separate to him, but it\u2019s hard enough feeling like you\u2019re a burden, let alone being autistic and feeling like your a burden and your own twin hates you. You might have to eventually apologise, not necessarily for what you said (well maybe for some of what you said), but definitely for your delivery.", "This is a very soft ESH\n\nI am a mom to a child with significant developmental disabilities, and I am a twin. The expectation that you be forced to always include your brother doesn\u2019t even make sense for typical twin siblings. You are two separate people. Your mother is absolutely an asshole. I understand that for her it can be incredibly hard to have a child who you know will never be able to experience life like their typical sibling. That life for them is limited, harder, and so many things many take for granted, are completely out of reach.  But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s your responsibility to make up for that. It isn\u2019t fair for your brother to miss out, but it also isn\u2019t fair to only allow you to socialize with him.  \n\nIt\u2019s clear that your mother forcing you two together has created a LOT of resentment and anger.  You are not responsible for that, but you will be responsible for dealing with it in a healthy way as you continue to grow and get older.  \n\nNow, you are an asshole for how you took out your anger on your brother. He didn\u2019t create this expectation. He isn\u2019t responsible for this situation. Your mother is. You find yourself between a rock and a hard place because you aren\u2019t allowed autonomy over your social life. You\u2019re being forced to stay home all the time, or bring your brother, which ends up ruining your time with friends and others.  I suspect if your social and personal identity felt more your own, your anger at your brother being around you at a school wouldn\u2019t feel so suffocating.  But as how things stand, you can not separate yourself from him. Even for typical twins, this would be incredibly hard to deal with and would create the same animosity. \n\nWith all of this, you have your brother stuck in the middle. It isnt his choice that he is being forced on you. And it doesn\u2019t sound like he understands why you are angry or how his presence has created so much resentment.  For him, he sees being with you as his only opportunity to do things all the other kids get to do. He doesn\u2019t understand that putting that expectation on you isn\u2019t fair. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is some jealousy from him mixed in. From his perspective, you denied him the opportunity to get out of the house and have fun. And then yelled at him and blamed him for something he sees as your choice.  I\u2019m also guessing that he doesn\u2019t have the same level of developmental ability to process his emotions as you do. So taking out your anger on him, makes you an asshole, even though your anger is justified.", "NTA your mum is wrong to push him on you. I hope you will understand that it\u2019s not his fault and have a healthier relationship with him when you\u2019re older, when you can chose to spend a more appropriate smaller amount of time together, when you\u2019re not already busy with something else.", "ESH.

That's just horrible.", "ESH.\n\nYou - for yelling at Zack.

She has to understand that in no way or form having your brother join you on your dates is appropriate, and basically, she is just using you to babysit Zack.", "ESH\n\nLook, Zack can't control the way he behaves.

I think your mom needs to ease up on you and figure out another way to get Zach the socialization he needs. I think you will ultimately regret causing a permanent rift between yourself and your brother, when he\u2019s not doing anything he can really help, even if it feels awful to deal with. It\u2019s also important to consider the kinds of friends you have, if they would rather leave you out of things instead of empathizing with your situation. Easier said than done, but I\u2019d try to find friends who will be there for you even when things suck, not just when it\u2019s easy and fun.

She was more fortunate than you however because as I got older my seizures became less frequent and didn't need to be around someone all the time.

This isn't your autistic brother's fault, he doesn't sound to be high functioning or low functioning. He sounds like he's a level 2, potentially, which could mean that your parents *are* wrongfully parentifying you to set you up to be his caregiver in the future. \n\nI'm not saying this is 100% the case, but I'm also autistic and high-functioning so I'm trying to read the situation out of \"inside\" experience to people who are lower functioning (please don't take this as an insult, I couldn't find a better way to word it) but your anger should be directed to your parents over your brother. \n\nAs far as he's concerned, yes he does need to be held to some accountability but I don't know for sure what he struggles with or what level he's been diagnosed under so I'll leave that part there. He does, however, probably not realize why you resent him like the other comment above stated. \n\nHe might idolize you because as the other comment also said, you could be his gateway to a \"normal\" social life. He can be included! It probably feels wonderful for him to be included in normal things. Take it from someone who got autism stereotyped, it doesn't feel good for people to exclude you because of your diagnosis or how it presents itself. \n\nI also wouldn't be too harsh on him over a meltdown, you don't understand how his brain works. He could've been going through a number of overwhelming emotions with the genuine inability to express that you blaming him hurt him. It took me years of therapy to be able to properly verbally express why I was upset/what made me upset, and I wouldn't be surprised if this regulation is a skill he lacks. Sometimes, those of us on the spectrum can't put it into words until it has passed, it could be debilitating. \n\nAll in all, I don't think you're in the wrong for being angry, but I do believe your \"stand\" with your parents is going to cause more tension for everyone. Your brother doesn't deserve the treatment just as much as you don't deserve parentification. Your brother also doesn't deserve to lose you over it, I'd suggest potentially creating an ultimatum of you receiving therapy (trust me, it could be good for you), your own space when requested, etc whatever you need in order to not resent him and even potentially isolating yourself to give yourself a break before you allow him to tag along with you.\n\nIt should be your choice, but please understand that he isn't in the wrong.

However, she's saddling you with that task, and it's making you resent your brother and likely your mother, too. I'm curious if you've tried calmly discussing this with her (not in the heat of an argument)? Maybe ask her questions; why does she want him to join you? What is her goal? What does she hope to accomplish? Start a dialogue. She may not realize that it's having the opposite effect she intends. Ask if you can compromise, maybe you take him sometimes but not every time.

Expanding it to include a situation where a junior in high school is being asked to socially include his autistic brother strikes me as not only wrong-headed but really profoundly damaging.
