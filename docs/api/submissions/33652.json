We moved in together, got married, and had a baby in less than a year. Everything seemed perfect at first. We both had our careers, cop and teacher. Our goals in life seemed to align perfectly. He was very caring throughout the pregnancy and attended to all of my needs. He even planned my baby showers because I wanted them but didn\u2019t want to deal with the planning. He just seemed perfect\u2026until he started to leave me alone all the time while heavily pregnant. I was coming home from work and going to sleep by myself and constantly complained to him that he needed to prioritize his new family, not his friends. Eventually, he cheated. This put a damper on the romance, but we were welcoming our baby soon and tried our best to make it work. When I was in labor, I had to have a C-section due to complications with the umbilical cord. My husband handled everything related to the baby such as feedings and diaper changes because I couldn\u2019t move too much. When we were discharged, we lasted one night on our own before it became too much for him. My mom had to come help us. He was comfortable leaving the baby in the living room to sleep with my mom, but as a new mother, I wanted to take care of my baby. One night, I cried and cried unable to get up to get my crying baby, hoping he would. He yelled at me, \u201cFrom now on, you\u2019re on your own, I\u2019m not getting up anymore.\u201d Since then, I handled night feedings with my mom. During the day, he would constantly go out with his friends. Two weeks postpartum, he went on a 10 hour hike and was texting another woman. He was a completely different person. He blamed it on my mom always being there. It got to the point where he kicked her out, helped a few days, and suddenly decided to keep going out. My mom had to step in again to help me. After that, he was constantly asking for her to stay over. She helped him with laundry, meal preps, etc. There was absolutely nothing she wouldn\u2019t help with. \n7 months later, he is still a very absent father and husband. He completely places the blame on me for constantly having my mom there to help me. His mother blames me for not giving him the rightful position as husband in our household. I\u2019m the one who pays for most of the formula and diapers. I\u2019m the one taking the baby to all of the doctor\u2019s visits with my mother because he refuses to. If he were to be asked what size diaper the baby wears, he doesn\u2019t know. His mom claims it\u2019s my fault for not letting him be a father. \nAt this point, we are separating. The love is gone. The betrayals are one too many. The constant disrespect towards my mom is heartbreaking, but he and his family constantly blame me for choosing my mom over him.

I\u2019m choosing the first one Every Time lol", "The math isn\u2019t mathing here. From the story your baby is at least 7 months old and it takes almost 10 to make a baby. If you got pregnant the day you met he wasn\u2019t older than 20. Why lie about one year though lol", "As long as it gets done.", "He deserves whatever she can get him for. He needs to be held accountable for his actions. No sympathy for him at all.", "He is still of no value. He made himself disposable, which is proper.", "He won\u2019t have a leg to stand on demanding equal access. He has equal access now and he opts not to be there.", "Yes. Never. I'd throw firemen in there too.", "I'm sorry for you that you had to learn a life lesson the hard way, sincerely. I feel even more sorry for your kid. Having a cop for a parent is terrible, I mean having a cop in the family is terrible. =/", "[deleted]", "Get a parenting app and cut him out of your life as much as possible.", "I would absolutely love it if he signed his rights away as I have zero problem taking care of my child on my own. However, he would never do it out of spite. He sees himself as an amazing father who will fight for 50/50 custody in court just because he can. Does nothing for our baby but wants 50/50 custody. Abuses his authority as a police officer and threatens it all the time along with calling the cops on my mother for \u201ctrespassing.\u201d", "Exactly, it takes two to make a baby, and it was a terrible decision on both your parts. You (plural) married and had a baby with someone you knew less than a year...that's irresponsible. Sorry you're in this position, but I also hope that you learn something from this for your future relationships.", "Yes it does take two. You were one of them.", "It\u2019s genuinely nuts to \nmeet, marry and procreate with someone within a year. You don\u2019t know him at all, this was a serious lapse in judgement", "Don't forget the cheating.. \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2c", "21 in April. 24 in June. \n22 in April. Baby born in May. 25 in June. Makes sense?", "Yes he needs to be held accountable.

Tell him if he keeps making those kinds of threats you'll report him to his supervisor.  If he claims that won't work, simply say, \"I'll go higher.\"  If he works in a municiplaity, you want to go to the mayor or the city manager.  You may ulitmately have to get a restraining order against him.\n\nThe only reason he wants 50/50 custody is to avoid child support.   F\\*ck him.", "Move out of the jurisdiction for which he is a cop. It won't solve everything - cops cover for cops. But they especially cover for those on the same force. If you're in a different town, that will help at least a little bit.", "Being a cop doesn't mean the courts won't see through him. Just to be safe though, record any verbal communication you have with him as proof of his terrible behavior. Charge him with child neglect and abandonment. \n\nScreenshot or take pics of his communication with other women. See if his friend is willing to make a legal statement or sign an affidavit that backs up what you say he told you. Get proof of his abuse of power when he's working. Start reporting him to his supervisor. If that doesn't work, go up the chain of command.\n\n>It got to the point where he kicked her out, helped a few days, and suddenly decided to keep going out. My mom had to step in again to help me. After that, he was constantly asking for her to stay over.\n\nHe can't charge your mother with trespassing if he keeps inviting her over.  Record that. Check his e-mail for other proof of wrongdoing. Oh, an as far as his position in the household as husband and father? That would require that he actually behave as both of those things by standing beside you as a husband should as an equal partner and helping take care of the child he helped create.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "As Reddit would say: Save the proof of you being the one to buy baby products. Try saving any texts where he says he went out with friends, and ask your mother to reaffirm his absence if this goes to court to prove he\u2019s an incapable parent. Good luck.", "Correct. The one actually taking responsibility.", "I honestly agree. I should\u2019ve been more realistic.", "Custody and support are separate. A custodial parent can't withhold visitation over child support. If anything, OP should try for spousal support.", "LMFAO he made himself worthless. That isn't misandry. That's him choosing his own path to the dumpster.", "This isn't missandry dude \n\nWomen get better O's from toys, and other women and themselves then they do men, what else do you think his purpose was?  \n\nSeriously?  He has no purpose in ops life in this point beyond being a pia, and a child support check that will never arrive in the mail", "Not when one abandons them and sees no value in having that time with them until it conveniences them. If you live with your child and never see them, then suddenly want equal 50/50 time after the divorce to skirt child support I\u2019m laughing you out of the court and slamming you with max allowable child support.", "And there's the misandrist anti-sex agenda that believes that men must be punished for having sex.", "I\u2019m concerned with his slight connection to the mayor. Called him directly for some overtime hours and now he\u2019s loaded with hours every week. The mayor favors the police department and his cops.", "I hate to break it to you, but chances of 'higher' doing anything (or giving a flying fuck) are pretty small. This is fairly standard behaviour in *far* too many departments.", "I think the point they\u2019re making is that by marrying and having a kid with someone you barely knew, you were risking your child not having a decent father.\n\nThey\u2019re also a cop so ppl usually call that a red flag. Not all cops are bad, but to make huge life decisions with major life repercussions when you barely knew the guy is irresponsible. You also need your mother to help you, so while you are taking responsibility now, it\u2019s a bit late.", "Yes I agree with spousal support for a set period of time.", "Men must take accountability for their choice to engage in unprotected sex, yes. That\u2019s not misandry. \ud83d\ude06 Your choice comes prior to the sex as that\u2019s the only part that involves your body. Hers is at every step as she\u2019s the one pregnant. The choice to have sex was both of them, they both decided on this.", "How was he punished for having sex? He chose not to wear a condom. \n\nYou need help", "That is not ideal.  You may have to go with a restraining order.  I cannot stress how unprofessional it is for an officer to use his position to threaten someone.  \n\nDocument everything he says.", "If I was a SAHM, I wouldn\u2019t need as much help as I do. Since I work full time, my mother helps me with my child and then I take over once I get home from work. Zero breaks. \n\nI don\u2019t understand what you mean by \u201cit\u2019s a bit late.\u201d I\u2019ve taken responsibility of my child since they were born. I had a major surgery to have my child and needed assistance. Afterwards, with the constant arguing, stress, sleepless nights, zero help from my husband, and the cheating, recovery took longer, but I was always up day and night with my baby. How was it a bit late?", "And there's the sexism.  It's always a man's fault.", "No one has said it's the man's fault. They are criticising your statement that the 'man is punished for having sex' in response to a comment stating that both were responsible for having unprotected sex. You are unhinged."]}
