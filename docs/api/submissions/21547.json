Jack has two children, but this concerns his daughter \u2013 Ella (15F). The day Jack told me he wanted a divorce, we told the children after school. \r  \n\r  \nElla was upset when she found out we are divorcing and went to her room. She came down after tea when it was just me and her in the house \u2013 Jack and his son had gone out. She asked me why her dad and I were getting divorce and wanted to know if it was because of her. Ella has struggled with an ED, and while it had caused some strain because we couldn\u2019t agree on how to help Ella it is not the reason. I told Ella that she and her brother are not the reason for the divorce, but that her best friend\u2019s (Imogen 15F) mum (Sophie 34F) is. Sophie and Jack had an affair when she was 19, when the affair was exposed Sophie\u2019s life basically imploded while Jack\u2019s pretty much remained the same. Just to state, Imogen is not Jack\u2019s daughter. They are friends now, but after the affair they would just be polite in the street and became friendlier over the years as the girls became close friends at school. I told Ella that Jack\u2019s continued friendship with Sophie and the running to her for advice is why we are getting divorced. Ella asked if Jack was having an affair with Sophie. I told her that Jack was denying having an affair with Sophie again but I suspected it. She asked what I meant by again, so I told her that Sophie and Jack had an affair when Jack was married to her mum.\r  \n\r  \nElla has not been speaking to Jack since our conversation. She has also lashed out at Imogen, telling her that her mum is a whore and is the reason her family is falling apart. They got into a physical fight at school which resulted in both Jack and Sophie getting called in to talk about it. In the meeting, Ella told them everything I had told her the night before and blamed Sophie for ruining her family again. Jack told her that Sophie isn\u2019t the reason. Jack told Ella the reason for the divorce is because he no longer trusted me because of a mistake I had made which had sent us to therapy. Months of therapy weren\u2019t able to repair his trust in me. \n\nAfter Jack and Ella came home, she is now not talking to me either. Jack is furious that I said anything to Ella and that I ruined Ella\u2019s friendship with Imogen.\r Jack snapped that it was not my place to say anything to Ella. He was angry that I was still stuck on his friendship with Sophie, and continues to maintain nothing is going on. He told me that Imogen told Sophie in the meeting that she wants to move to a new school, where no one knows her mum is a whore and that was my fault. \r  \n\r  \nAITA? Ella asked me for a reason and I told her, I do believe Sophie is the true reason as the relationship between them is weird.", "created_utc": 1688686892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14spxl8/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_her_friends_mum/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The girl is going through enough with her ED.  Why would you cut off two of her main support lifelines when she's already struggling as it is and likely to need more support in the future?\n\nYour marriage issues are your problems.  Keep them to yourself or tell your besties.  It's not appropriate to overshare adult drama with a 15 year old child who is not your own over tea.  And it wasn't the truth, was it?  You conveniently left out your own \"mistake\", which is the actual reason for the divorce.  So what you did was distort the narrative into a damaging lie, feed it to a child who trusted you, and watch her world burn. \n\nYou blew that girl's life up for no reason other than your own bitterness.  She got into a fight at school, and now her former best friend wants to leave the school completely.  Those poor girls, both of them.

You cheating because you think your husband cheated... is still you cheating.\n\nSo instead of admitting your mistake, you blew up a kids life who obviously would have to live with their dead, their friends, their school mates, etc all so you could feel blameless?
