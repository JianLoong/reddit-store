Jack has two children, but this concerns his daughter \u2013 Ella (15F). The day Jack told me he wanted a divorce, we told the children after school. \r  \n\r  \nElla was upset when she found out we are divorcing and went to her room. She came down after tea when it was just me and her in the house \u2013 Jack and his son had gone out. She asked me why her dad and I were getting divorce and wanted to know if it was because of her. Ella has struggled with an ED, and while it had caused some strain because we couldn\u2019t agree on how to help Ella it is not the reason. I told Ella that she and her brother are not the reason for the divorce, but that her best friend\u2019s (Imogen 15F) mum (Sophie 34F) is. Sophie and Jack had an affair when she was 19, when the affair was exposed Sophie\u2019s life basically imploded while Jack\u2019s pretty much remained the same. Just to state, Imogen is not Jack\u2019s daughter. They are friends now, but after the affair they would just be polite in the street and became friendlier over the years as the girls became close friends at school. I told Ella that Jack\u2019s continued friendship with Sophie and the running to her for advice is why we are getting divorced. Ella asked if Jack was having an affair with Sophie. I told her that Jack was denying having an affair with Sophie again but I suspected it. She asked what I meant by again, so I told her that Sophie and Jack had an affair when Jack was married to her mum.\r  \n\r  \nElla has not been speaking to Jack since our conversation. She has also lashed out at Imogen, telling her that her mum is a whore and is the reason her family is falling apart. They got into a physical fight at school which resulted in both Jack and Sophie getting called in to talk about it. In the meeting, Ella told them everything I had told her the night before and blamed Sophie for ruining her family again. Jack told her that Sophie isn\u2019t the reason. Jack told Ella the reason for the divorce is because he no longer trusted me because of a mistake I had made which had sent us to therapy. Months of therapy weren\u2019t able to repair his trust in me. \n\nAfter Jack and Ella came home, she is now not talking to me either. Jack is furious that I said anything to Ella and that I ruined Ella\u2019s friendship with Imogen.\r Jack snapped that it was not my place to say anything to Ella. He was angry that I was still stuck on his friendship with Sophie, and continues to maintain nothing is going on. He told me that Imogen told Sophie in the meeting that she wants to move to a new school, where no one knows her mum is a whore and that was my fault. \r  \n\r  \nAITA? Ella asked me for a reason and I told her, I do believe Sophie is the true reason as the relationship between them is weird.", "created_utc": 1688686892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14spxl8/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_her_friends_mum/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jack had an affair many many years ago and long before he married you. You refuse to be self-aware or own up to anything and used your version of events in an attempt to Ella, a young teenager with health issues, on your side. And you ruined her relationship with her best friend. This sounds like revenge on your part, not caring for or loving a child.\n\nJack needs to just cut all contact you have with his children as soon as possible.", "Info: What mistake were you in therapy for that he views as the reason you are divorcing?", "YTA\n\nWhat did Ella, a 15 year old girl, do to you that you would blow up her relationship with her father AND her best friend during a difficult time in her life?  The girl is going through enough with her ED.  Why would you cut off two of her main support lifelines when she's already struggling as it is and likely to need more support in the future?\n\nYour marriage issues are your problems.  Keep them to yourself or tell your besties.  It's not appropriate to overshare adult drama with a 15 year old child who is not your own over tea.  And it wasn't the truth, was it?  You conveniently left out your own \"mistake\", which is the actual reason for the divorce.  So what you did was distort the narrative into a damaging lie, feed it to a child who trusted you, and watch her world burn. \n\nYou blew that girl's life up for no reason other than your own bitterness.  She got into a fight at school, and now her former best friend wants to leave the school completely.  Those poor girls, both of them.  To have their lives torn apart by you because you can't admit that YOU'RE the one who ended your own marriage.  \n\nYou're a real piece of work to go after kids like that.", "YTA - you clearly did this to be vindictive, thats it. Youre an AH for that.", "To be honest with you I feel like you should\u2019ve just told her that she wasn\u2019t the reason for the divorce and left it at that, because now it\u2019s tearing the children apart. Keep things short and simple. So YTA.", "Are you kidding? YTA and also extremely horrible and vindictive. Jack and his children will be infinitely better off without such a toxic person in their lives", "Why did you conveniently exclude details of your own transgressions against Ella's father while you were dumping all of this on her?\n\nYou already know - YTA !\n\nAND you WBTAH even IF there had been no transgression on your part, simply for the fact that you dragged an innocent child into your adult problems trying to vindicate yourself. \n\nRegardless of who is to blame for your divorce, you are 100% responsible for the hurt and destruction you brought upon these poor children. \n\nShame on you!", "YTA. You put a lot of adult shit on a 15yo's shoulders for no other reason than to punish her father. Well now she's punishing both of you. I hope you're fucking proud of yourself. Her life will never be the same.", "YTA yes - you do not need to get Ella on your \u201cside\u201d - are you 12?", "Wow, yes YTA.   You used her to hurt your husband and the friend and ended up hurting two innocent kids with them.   What you did was something you'd see from a drama driven pre-teen not mature enough to think ahead about consequences.   There was no reason that you can justify dragging kids into your marital mess.  \n\nThe icing on the cake here is this was \nall just suspicion and you're the actual cheater.", "Wow YTA", "YTA. I\u2019m all for transparency and honesty\u2026. But there\u2019s also a necessity to be age appropriate and think of the reason why you dumped on her. You just basically blew up a teens life to be spiteful towards her dad.", "YTA and Ella deserved much better from an adult. How dare you rip apart the fabric of a 15-year-old girl's life to justify your behavior?  No sympathy here because you did absolutely nothing the right way, at least as far as that child went.", "I came to say YTA, and then I read your comments. You are an even bigger AH than initially thought. You cheated, and your husband couldn't get past it, so you blow up his daughters life with a mistake he made when he was 19 years old. \n\nNot only do you ruin her relationship with her best friend, you accuse another woman (with no proof) of having an affair and probably damage her relationship with her daughter, and you implode your step daughters relationship with her father while she is already struggling with an ED.\n\nI hope you're proud of yourself.", "You\u2019re an asshole", "YTA - you and your husband clearly have some issues with each other and neither of you is prepared to take responsibility for your own part in the breakdown of your (remarkably brief) marriage but there is no cause to drag the kids or anybody else into this or to set the kids to blaming each other and taking sides.\n\nYou being insecure about your partner\u2019s friendship with his ex is a good reason not to have married him in the first place but it doesn\u2019t make the ex responsible for your marriage or its failure.\n\nEither way, turning the kids against their father (especially a child who already has very serious problems of her own) is a low blow and needing to \u201cwin\u201d against your partner in the \u201cyour fault\u201d games does not excuse you from devastating a young girl and destroying some of her very few stable connections just to satisfy your own petty vengeance.\n\nShe\u2019s got a whole lifetime to observe her dad\u2019s character and behaviour; she needs reassurance that she isn\u2019t at fault herself and didn\u2019t drive you away, sure, but she does not need that expanded into telling tales on her dad that might very well not even be true.", "INFO: what is the mistake made that caused you to go to therapy?", "INFO: what was this \"mistake\" and why is it the only piece of info you excluded?\n\nStong suspicion that YTA", "YTA.   Why the hell would you tell her about an affair her dad had 15 years ago???

No matter WHAT goes on in a marriage the kids don\u2019t need that burden of truth.

I love you both and nothing will change that.\u201d Literally ANYTHING. You said something hurtful because you knew it would get back to Jack and somehow this affair you\u2019re so desperate to prove will be true. Then when things imploded Jack did the same damn thing you did. He told Ella you weren\u2019t ever to be trusted. So rather than apologize for the hurt you\u2019ve caused to both Ella and Imogen you\u2019ve seeked out the internet to give you validation. You won\u2019t find it here. YTAH.", "YTA. It sounds like your 'mistake' is that you had an affair which you don't want to outright say. And you didn't ask Jack for a divorce over Sophie, he asked you for a divorce because you actually definitively were known to have cheated.\n\nSo when Ella wondered if it was her fault instead of being honest and saying you cheated, you framed it like your husband MIGHT have cheated but you really have no evidence at all that he did. You cheating because you think your husband cheated... is still you cheating.\n\nSo instead of admitting your mistake, you blew up a kids life who obviously would have to live with their dead, their friends, their school mates, etc all so you could feel blameless?

You are the one who cheated here, and when you had to face consequences for that (which you completely deserved) you took it out on a 15 year old, and you did it by lying to her.", "I find it interesting that in your post on relationship advice you very conveniently left out your cheating.", "Biggest asshole I\u2019ve seen on one of these posts in a long while.\n\nI don\u2019t regularly comment on these posts but you handled this so unbelievably horribly I felt the need to\n\nElla deserves better and I hope she gets better\n\nYTA", "YTA   its hard to believe that this is actually true.   That someone could be that cruel and actually ask if they were right.  \n Why didn't you simply say no it's not you kids, and sometimes relationships don't always work forever.", "ESH  -  For weaponizing divorce, then attacking a child with it\n\nIt comes off as disingenuous, when an OP discreetly alludes to a mistake in their long diatribe, which later turns out to be a transgression on their part.  I no longer care if he or she are the cause of the divorce.  If not for the children those two seemed to deserve each other.
