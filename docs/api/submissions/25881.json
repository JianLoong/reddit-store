They think I am in the wrong. \n\nI 25f, from a Vietnamese household moved out a year ago due to my parents financial and emotional abuse. I have been severely depressed since living with them, and finally had the courage to move out last year. a mistake I have done is borrowing 100k home loan for my parents as they promised me that I will not need to pay any of the loan back. But they lied, they had made me pay 12.8k in which I wish I fought back, but years of emotional manipulation, it has gotten the better of me. Since then, I have been struggling financially, living paycheck after paycheck, even though I\u2019m working as a nurse. trying to be the best daughter I would come and visit them every week in which they always ask if I have saved any more money, and I said no. Since I moved out, they have been trying to make me move back with them in which I refused as I chose happiness over money. \n\nThey compare me to my twin sister who is still with them saving more and putting more in for the home loan than me as I\u2019m the oldest. They told my sister that they will \u201cmake\u201d move back home, and if I don\u2019t, they will never look at my boyfriend again and they will disown me. I have been depression free for the past few months now it all has come rushing back again. Every time I visit them they were also knows the kind and I have thought they have changed, but after I leave, talk about me like this. They want me to move back to save up for my future, i dont believe it anymore \n\nI know some of you may think I am stupid,  but it\u2019s very hard to get out of this manipulation since I was brought up with it when I was little.  The fact that i still love them so much is stupid \n\nThank you for reading\n\nEdit 1: to clarify, my parents has been constantly pushing me almost everyday to get out that loan even when I constantly refused. They guilt tripped me and had told me many times they promise to pay it off and I did not need to pay anything at all\n\nEdit 2: Thank you so much to those who were so kind with their words and gave me advice.

I have an ex like you, she literally takes anti depressants because her parents are so bad, but she refuses to leave them. The level of damage they have done to her is astronomical up to and including a miscarriage. \n\nMy ahole part in this. As a concerned citizen blocked them asap.\n\nSeriously you need to Block your parents all together, do not contact or allow contact with them. Block them cry all you need to, and cleanse them from your system. All you are doing is showing them they have control of you, every time you visit and if you go back, you'll basically confirm their power even more. \n\n\nNothing good will happen from contacting them. And in the future, when things are calmed and you are relaxed, they will come back and pretend nothing ever happened while also trying to guilt you for not having helped them. \n\n\nAlso if you still have that loan out, find a way to get it back", "NTA. Unless you signed a document promising to pay them back stop giving them money. They gave it as a gift. And block them", "Nta they'll disown you?  Sounds like a win.", "NTA. Your brain tells you the right thing, listen to its chemistry: free yourself of them. Go NC, or at least a lot less contact. Also, why would you care if they disown you if they make you feel like shit? \n\nNow, refarding the loan: ypu should contact a lawyer and let him/her work it out. Maybe you need to pay it back legally (?), but that does not mean you need to have contact with your parents. It is a transaction by a bank, nothing that needs to be done in person. \n\nIt sucks that you have parents like that and you need the distance in the first place. But he distsnce is right", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are abusing you emotionally and financially.  You were naive to take out a loan in your name and give them the money, if that is what you have done.  No one should ever have their name on a mortgage unless their name is also on the property deed. \n\nThey want you to move home so that you can continue to give them the money that YOU earned.  They want you home every night so they can have more opportunity to convince you to do as they say.  You are not their property. You are not their little earning machine.\n\nThe proper financial relationship between parent and child is for the parent to provide for the child at least through age 18.  At that point you should owe nothing and they owe nothing.  If you choose to live at home then you agree to pay some rent or help with bills, but if you choose to leave then you owe them nothing.\n\nYes you should love them for who they are and for helping you get this far in life, but if their love is conditional, then yours can be too.", "NTA and I don't think you're stupid at all for loving them. Cultural and familial ties shape us. You can love them from a distance, though, and you definitely need to keep that distance for your own health. I think you know that, but I'm so sorry you're in this situation.", "NTA. They're honestly doing you a favor by disowning you.  I don't know how they managed to get a home loan in your name, but if I were in your position I would just declare bankruptcy and/or let the bank foreclose on the home. It'll be inconvenient in the short term, but you'll be free and clear in seven years. It's crazy for your parents to be saddling their 25 year old daughter with a $100K debt. They also have no say in who you see or don't see. I doubt your boyfriend will be missing out on much if people like that refuse to see him again.", "NTA they don\u2019t sound healthy and you got to do the thing people call a selfish act. You have to look out for yourself first.", "NTA. No, don't go back. They're probably angry that they can't manipulate and control you anymore so they're threatening to disown you. As for the loan, was it their money or they took loan on your behalf? Just want to know if they're financially dependent on you. It is very common in most Asian cultures for parents to have strong control over their kids' futures and they also tend to guilt trip to have their way.

Block them, you owe them nothing!", "NTA - I would go no contact with them.", "NTA..\n\nI've been in a similar situation, when I moved out I cried so much and almost didn't left because I felt I was abandoning them (also they made me feel that way).\n\nAnd I still love them, but I've been in therapy for a lot of years now and I know I cannot change them or live with them.\n\nYou can still love your parents and acknoledge they're bad for your mental health.\n\nMy advice? Let them think whatever they want to think. Sounds very manipulative to me what they say to you and in my experience, you could've left 5 years ago and they'll still tell you you need to come back.\n\nIf you can't ignore them, I recomend taking a break and distance, even if you have to tell them you're busy with work or other stuff. Also, therapy and mature friends was a great support for me, I think that could help a lot.", "Wait, you loaned 100.000 from them, thought you didn\u2019t have to pay it back, but you had to, you payed back 12.800, so you still owe 87.200. You need to pay them that amount back before you go no contact. It\u2019s great that you chose happiness over money, if it had been your money. But you can\u2019t just decide not to pay them back money you owe, because you want to be happy.

Then we moved in together, and it turns out even when they moved out they let their parents rule their life. By extension, it also ruled MY life. They were miserable and constantly at the whims and whimsy of people used to using them as a pawn and a battering ram. Literally would come back anxious and in tears from visits but would keep begging to their every request. It was genuinely insane to watch from the sidelines.", "I think she means to say she took out a loan for them to buy a house? At least that's what I understood. I could be wrong though.", "All of this, and op, try to learn to love yourself the way your parents should have. I'm sorry to say that any expressions of love from them come off as manipulations on their part. You deserve better.", "They actually made me put my name under the house with my twin. I really regret it since I dont even live there. If I knew this will be the outcome will will never do it. I beat myself up everyday knowing I did this to myself and dont have the courage to stand up for myself", "I\u2019m trying to stick to what I want and that is not moving back in. Regarding the loan, they had made me take it out at the bank myself. They had paid half of it but making me pay for the rest after they promised they will pay it all", "So they had me loan 100k under my name, in which they had promised me they will be the ones to pay off the 100k. I refused to borrow the 100k because i cannot pay it off but they guilt tripped me saying I will not be in debt has they have the money to pay it off. So I borrowed it and they paid half of it and they are now asking me to pay it off. I never wanted to owe them anything, I just dont have the money to pay it off. I have put it off so many times but they are constantly calling  me and guilt tripping me. They own many properties and i doubt they dont have enough", "How is she TA? Her parents said she didn\u2019t have to pay them back!", "OP how much is still remaining on the loan? Less than $50,000? \nDo you pay the bank directly since its in your name???\n\nI mean youre NTA here at all, but since your parents are the AH, and have financially abused you, if may be worth cutting your losses and going no contact and just trying to pay off the rest of the loan on your own.", "That\u2019s very different from what you wrote in the original post, I\u2019d edit that if I were you. With this info, you are NTA, and good luck getting your money back. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be the one paying for the second half of the loan. What awful people they are!", "She literally said it was a loan from the start. She has now clarified that it was a completely different story than she first said."]}
