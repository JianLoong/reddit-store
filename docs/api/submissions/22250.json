We both graduated from the same program and hold (or held) the same job position at different companies. We initially started dating in the program, and since then we had grown to love each other deeply. This started about 6 months ago when she came home one day and told me she quit her job and wanted to instead invest in \"growing her business\" which is a social media account based around beauty stuff.\r  \n\r  \nShe had mentioned this as a possibility before, but I had said It doesn't seem like a good decision because we both have well-paying jobs and we need to save as much as possible now to pay off our student loans and to have money if we wanted to get married soon, have kids, etc. Well, she came home that day and said if I didn't want to support and believe in her then I could just leave. I said fine- let's see how it goes.\r  \n\r  \nWell, six months have passed and it's safe to say it did'nt work out. The account has like 200 followers and she hasn't made a dime off of it in half a year. I've been working around 50 hours a week to pay our bills, loans, insurance, etc. I figured the least she could do is help pull her weight around the house, but she just leaves trash and dirty clothes around so on my days off I have to clean and do chores the entire time and pick up after her. I asked her nicely several times to at least clean up her messes, and she would always agree but never do it.\r  \n\r  \nWe were eating dinner a couple of nights ago and I just laid it all out on the table. I explained I was frustrated that she wasn't helping out around the house, that she just quit her job out of nowhere, and that it made me sad because I felt like we both worked so hard to set ourselves up for success and to live a comfortable good life and that she's throwing it away over a hobby. I said I didn't want to work 50 hour weeks the rest of my life and mentioned that she would have to at least start working part-time.\r  \n\r  \nShe started SOBBING like full-on snot running out of her nose and called me a dick before storming off. She packed up and left the next day saying she needs a week to think about things. She then stopped replying to my messages, so I texted her mom just to see if she was okay and she said she is and is staying at her house. I feel terrible because we rarely get into fights but over the last 6 months it's just felt like I'm dating a different person.\r  \n\r  \nI'm not willing to accept this behavior any longer. She asked me to give it a chance, I did, it didn't work out, so now she needs to reroute. According to her though, I'm the asshole for being frustrated and for \"basically calling her a failure\" (which I never at any point said to her). All I want is for her to return to work.

This is just wild. Can she not do it in the evenings or on weekends until it takes off?", "NTA. While it takes much longer than 6 months to start a successful business, she shouldn\u2019t have unilaterally decided you would support her financially and it sounds like physically. \n\nShe also seems to argue in ultimatums in order to scare you. She is at an age where mental health issues could be popping up or she\u2019s just a selfish ass. Either way, you are right to stand up for yourself.", "NTA- Time for her grow up and get a job or you need to leave her lazy butt.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't put up with this crap.", "NTA, making money on social media isn\u2019t easy and isn\u2019t a guarantee. Those who have prospered had been doing it while working an actual job that pays money. She can continue to work on her social media career but she need to also have a job on top of it.", "Okay I get where she is coming from, but in my opinion, you're NTA. I'm sure she must have wanted to feel successful in being a content creator, however since it's not going as well she feels like a 'failure' herself. Also, sometimes gaining a good amount of followers on social media takes a lot longer than 6 months. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I don't think you're in the wrong. I mean you did give her 6 months to try and see how it goes for her. You are also paying for most of the stuff and I don't think its fair to you for have to be suffering when she's the one who quit HER job. She projected when she said she felt like you called her a 'failure'. It's what she's probably feeling right now, but she needs to understand that it's not fair to you to take up the burden for paying everything and cleaning the house. \n\nIf you guys talk again, maybe try telling her that you will support her through her social media decision, however only if she agrees to work part time and start maintaining the house. Try to tell her how its not fair to you and that you are trying to support her but its just not working out.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t want a future with someone who has that little ambition. It isn\u2019t fair for you", "NTA.", "NTA. It sounds like the two of you aren't truly compatible. You want a partner, and she wants a sugar daddy. And it's a good thing you discovered this before marriage and kids. You wouldn't be able to get out of this unscathed once you have kids.", "Dude, I'm 52 and I've lived this life for 30 years. Go read my post in the infidelity forum if you want to see how it worked out for me. Supported my wife as a SAHM for most of our marriage and all I got for it was a dead bedroom and a wife who won't even speak to me anymore and can't even be bothered to clean the house.\n\nGet out now.", "NTA - It sounds like maybe she got sucked in by a MLM. The percentage of people who profit off MLM's is 1%. If this is a case, ask her to do some research into the reality of these types of business. If this is not the case, making a living on social media is hard. There is no way to predict what will go viral and alot of it comes down to luck. It's not unreasonable to ask her to get a job to cover bills. She can still try to pursue her social media in her down time.", "NTA if she had Any respect and love for you she would Not be forcing you to work such grueling hours. \n\nThat she is absolutely fine with it shows her true feelings: you are a meal ticket, Nothing more. \n\nGet out while you still can.", "NTA and she's telling everyone it's your fault. Zero accountability. Never seen that before \ud83d\ude44", "INFO\n\n> I've been working around 50 hours a week to pay our bills, loans, insurance, etc.\n\nYou've been paying off *her* loans?", "NTA. My boyfriend and I are in our 20s and I cannot imagine asking him to just pay for me while trying to make a social media account profitable. And FWIW - I\u2019ve earned money and free stuff through my dog\u2019s Instagram account. But no way would I ever quit my day job and try to live off of that. It\u2019s just not feasible unless you\u2019re already raking it in. \n\nAdd in she\u2019s not helping around the house AND you\u2019ve had to work 50 hour work weeks. You\u2019re not her parents. Sucks, but we all have to work. Whether that\u2019s around the house, or raising kids, or out working a job - it\u2019s not fair for one person to fully support a grown adult who had a paying job and quit because it wasn\u2019t fun enough. \n\nIf she\u2019s depressed, encourage her to see a therapist.

She's gonna need a job.", "Nta", "NTA....According to her though, I'm the asshole for being frustrated and for \"basically calling her a failure\"  --- You did not say this...this is in her head. She's the asshole for not being a quality partner and expects you to cater to her whims and wishes. She had no plan, quit a job and took on no responsibility in the relationship. She is self centered and immature. She lacks the skill to self assess and have adult conversations.\n\nHer actions are irresponsible and not sustainable. Quitting a job without bringing in cash to pay her obligations: loan, light, lunch sucks. She made selfish decisions like ditching her job without discussing it then you had to work 50 hrs weekly to keep you all afloat. She never checked in with you on this new life change or thanked you for you stepping up in 6 months. The sprinkles on top is her inability to pick up after herself or take on all household responsibilities while your out...ya know, cause you're working. Best to you!", "NTA you are not her parent and you didn\u2019t sign up to be her provider. You expected to have a partner not a mooch. She should have asked you if you were willing to support her BEFORE she quit her job. I don\u2019t know what it takes to make money on social media personally but the you tubers I watch have said it is very hard and takes sometimes years to make money at it. You two have drifted in different directions and that is alright. Some relationships don\u2019t last, you guys are not equal anymore so let her mom support her dream and you find someone who has the same priorities as you.", "NTA.

You can\u2019t support two people on one income.", "NTA, quitting her job before her social media account really took off was irresponsible, childish, and unfair. Then the fact that she is messy and doesn't pick up after herself is ridiculous. \n\nI know you must love her, but personally I think you are much better off without a leech like her. I kind of wonder if she was fired from her job then lied to make you think she had quit.", "NTA she was just waiting until you called her on it. She's going to keep lying to herself.. this is a good thing.. find someone who is a good partner", "NTA:   But it sound like she is depressed.

She\u2019s probably not even doing anything. You probably never even looked at her social content. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t post or do anything online. My teenage niece has thousands of followers and doesn't even try.  I suspect she just spends her days hanging out, eating, and watching TV, so you\u2019re right to dump her because she\u2019s not being honest with you about her activities.

Well... Meh.", "NTA. Youve been taking care of everything while she did who knows what.

Everyone who \"makes it\" swears they knew they would. But all the ones \"who knew they would\" who don't make it are never interviewed. She's reconciling it might not happen, so be sympathetic to this. Everyone has sworn to her through her whole life to pursue her dreams, she can do anything, blah, blah, blah. Many of us will go through this at some point of life, they call it a midlife crisis if you're a grown ass man. But grownups have responsibilities and she needs to make peace with getting a paid job.
