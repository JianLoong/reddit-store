In other words, slightly spin it that you want the absolute best care for her, the \"gold standard\" and you are not able or trained to provide it.\n\nYou sound like a wonderful grandson.", "NTA. Grandma wants what suits her, not what suits you. And with aging, the situation would only get worse. \nA nursing home or assisted living in her own home sound like the best options.", "NTA. A million times, NTA. You are too young to give up your time and energy. How does your fiance feel about this situation? If I were engaged to someone who became a caregiver and let a family member live with us, I'd leave. It probably makes me sound like an AH.", "I don't think you'd be the asshole at all. \n\nShe sold her condo and decided she was moving in with you without ever discussing it with you. You're offering her very generous alternatives, which you aren't obligated to provide.

Just because you're her grandchild doesn't mean you have to give up your life and home to take care of her.\n\nIn my opinion, you're being very kind to her by offering to still take care of her outside of your home. Not giving into her demands doesn't make you an asshole. If anything, I honestly think she's being an asshole here.", "NTA!  Absolutely. \n\nYou\u2019ve made a very reasonable offer that would get her nearby but allow you your privacy. If she doesn\u2019t like that, she is free to make other arrangements!  But it sounds like she would be incredibly uncomfortable to live with. \n\nHold your ground. Assisted living might be a good option for her.", "NTA but with her conditions she might benefit in going to assisted living care.

If your grandmother already has some mental issues (such as senile dementia or Alzheimer) it will worsen over the time, it's a matter of fact.\n\nWhat if you and your boyfriend work all day and grandma stays home alone? What if one day she leaves home and gets lost?", "NTA.", "NTA. And don't let her talk you round. It is bound to be a disaster, a recipe for your unhappiness.", "NTA\n\nShe cannot just decide she is moving in. \n\nI would suggest alternatives to care homes like assisted living or carers if you do not think you can live with her long term.", "YWNBTA and please don't do this.

And she clearly feels strongly entitled to move into your home, and that your opinion on the matter is not really relevant. For that reason you need to make it *very* clear that she cannot move in with you, and don\u2019t even consider letting her stay for a few months - she will never leave.", "NTA. No.", "No, you are NTA\n\nYou have offered Gma an alternative and she doesn't like that idea however she does not get to dictate to you that she will be moving in. \n\nIt would put too much of a strain on your relationship.", "NTA. Do not invite her to share your house. You are not responsible for her ever more demanding care. With her OCD you will become a stranger in your own home and it will certainly cause problems with your partner. \n\nYou have offered her several ways to help her but she says no, so you have done your bit. \n\nI am talking from experience here and believe me it\u2019s not fun.", "I am a nurse, in my country beside an elderly home we have an ambulant care service with care giver coming home to help with a few things. I worked for years in an elderly home and now I work ambulant having like 10-20 patients daily (depending on how much help everyone needs). Most people prefer being in their own home, when realizing that they can't anymore most prefer being with family. It's hard to loose the life they used to live and everything they are used to. But that's life. If you need help you need help. You gave her two reasonable options. It' s not that you didn't care for her at all. But you have a life , too. It's not fair to force you to live a life you don't want so she can have the one she wants. Life is about compromise. It's not your fault that she is old and needs help. Even if she wasn't a difficult person to live with but the sweetest old lady ever you would have the right so say no. Because having an older person to care for in your house makes it a job with no ending. You can't leave that situation ever that would changes your life and you boyfriends enourmous. It' s a big responsibility and she will get even older and needs more help. Don't take that responsibility if you don't want to.", "NTA \nI am a care giver and I can\u2019t imagine having to do it 24/7. Help her find somewhere but do not take on your mom\u2019s role.", "NTA She has other children who can/should step up.  You are getting married. You should start your life together focusing on your marriage.\n\nEdit: misread she sold the condo to her sibling.  Does she have other children?", "NTA. Don\u2019t cave on this. If she moves in she won\u2019t move out ever. She has other good options to choose from.", "NTA\n\nIf you let Grandma move in, her caretaker needs would take over your life.  And you don't owe it to anyone to give up your life to take care of Grandma in the manner she expects.\n\nCall her siblings and explain to them that you aren't able to have Grandma move in.  Then, absolutely don't let her in your home.", "No is a sentence.\n\nI'm sure your partner does not want your grandmother moving in either.\n\nShe is choosing to sell up. The sooner she knows you are not an option the better she can make a decision. \n\nTell her she cannot move in with you and be careful because she will try and get in through the back door. By saying that she needs to come for a short time. \n\nNTA", "No no no. NTA. I\u2019m afraid you would quickly begin to be resentful and it would destroy your relationship. You have offered reasonable alternatives. She is free to accept one of those alternatives or she can find her own solution.", "NTA", "Thank you so much. I actually grew up living in the same home with my mom and my grandparents so I do feel responsible for looking after her now that my mom's gone but having her live with me is definitely too much for me to handle right now.\n\nAlso I'm her grandson \ud83e\udd23", "I don't think you sound like an ah tbh. It's part of the reason why I don't want to let her live with me. My fiance didn't sign up for this and it wouldn't be fair on him since living together means he'd be forced to put up with her too.", "This is exactly what I'm afraid of, if I give her an inch she'll take a whole mile. I'm honestly conflicted because I grew up living with my mom and my grandparents so I do feel responsible for her now that she has no immediate family left but at the same time I defo can't be living with her.", "My mom was an only child. She has no immediate family left.", "Ooops so sorry! It's late here and I misread that. I'll just go ahead and do a well-needed edit!", "I think the fact that you are her grandson makes it even MORE important that she gets a carer that can inevitably handle the things that you wouldn't and shouldn't be responsible for.", ">Also I'm her grandson \ud83e\udd23\n\nYes, it says so in your post... wish people read.", "Just tell her you asked the cat and it said no.", ">if I give her an inch she'll take a whole mile\n\nYes, she will.\n\n>I do feel responsible for her\n\nBeing responsible doesn't mean you have to give in to her unreasonable demands, or personally be her caretaker.\n\nYou have offered her other options, and she has turned them down - because she thinks if she does that you'll cave and let her move in. Let her know that moving in with you is absolutely not on the cards, and she can either get the carer or she can speak to one of her siblings about moving in with them."]}
