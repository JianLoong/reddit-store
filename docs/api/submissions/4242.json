Been there, done that and I don't talk to any of them anymore. You do what makes you happy.", "Oh, boy, NTA\n\nI want you to listen very carefully to me, OP. Because I have CKD and ESRD. Currently, depending on who you talk to, my prognosis is 4 years to maybe more. (My vascular surgeon says \"Don't listen to those pussies! I'll tell you when your longevity is at risk!\")\n\nStage 3 chronic kidney failure is NOT LIFE THREATENING! Is it a serious illlness? Yes. BUT! It is very manageable so long as the person is compliant with their treatment plan. A person cannot get social security disability for stage 3 kidney failure. It has to be full on End Stage Renal Failure (ESRD) before they would qualify. You can still work full time as a stage 3 CKD patient. You can go do lots of stuff, because stage 3 ckd does NOT require dialysis, so I am not sure what kind of smoke your mom is trying to blow up your behind with saying you have to move home. I'm betting it's so that you can financially support them while he goes and goofs off, most certainly getting himself into ESRD within the next year or so with being dumb. DO NOT DO THIS!\n\nI worked full time up until I was late Stage 4 CKD. BY then, my kidney function was dropping below 20%. You do not start dialysis until 15%. Again, not sure why your mom is having conniptions at stage 3, unless your brother is just a completely irresponsible person about his health. I'm ESRD now, on dialysis and have some other serious gastric issues that make life fun, but here I am, at 7am in the morning, getting ready to go work my part time job, making plans for errands after work and for making a batch of sauerkraut, elderberry syrup and Fire cider. I am most certainly not on my death bed. (Though I do occasionally have to take a day and rest, but hey, that's what World of Warcraft is for!)  Your brother is only stage 3. If he straightens up and adheres to his treatment plan, follows the renal diet faithfully and sticks to a decent exercise regimen, he can avoid dialysis for 20 to 30 years, or more. Because while your kidneys are most certainly prone to be fragile under certain conditions, those little buggers are also pretty darn resilient if you take care of them properly! So, I definitely call BS on the \"you need to come home\" thing. NO! YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO ANYTHING BUT TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND YOUR KIDS!\n\nYou want to know why I am on dialysis at the age of 54? Because I did not prioritize my own health ahead of what \"but faaammmilllyyyy!\" wanted me to do. Am I salty about that? Darn tootin'! Because I will not see my daughter grow into a mature woman, or see my grandchildren or live to be a crazy old woman, cackling with delight over all the shocked faces when I say something or do something that they think an old woman should not be saying or doing. (See: Torturing my daughter until she's 60. I say that facetiously. Because she already gives me the \"I am sucking on the world's most sour lemon\" face frequently, like when I tell her I am working a free lance install gig. TBF, I did scare the bejeezus out of her by almost dying in 2017.)\n\nNo, what you need to do right now is give yourself a solid year of grieving for everything that has happened. The divorce, the family deaths, all of it. Make it a hard and fast rule. No major decisions for a year. Because YOU need to heal from the relationship trauma. Your KIDS need to heal from the relationship trauma. Have you stopped to realize that they were collateral damage yet? Because they were, Hon. Not trying to place blame or fault, but what you have to realize is that your kids have some trauma too, and that is gonna leave scars, just as it is with you.\n\nYou HAVE to prioritize yourself, because you have minor kids who cannot take care of themselves. That is your responsibility. Your mom and your brother are NOT, I repeat, NOT your responsibility! They are grown ass adults and can take care of themselves! \n\nNow, putting on my mom/grandma face for a minute: Have you found a therapist for yourself and your kids? If you have insurance, whether through work or Medicaid, it should cover it. I know mine covers telehealth therapy for free. Look into it. Take advantage of it. Because you need all the help you can get to learn tools for establishing your boundaries and then enforcing them with extreme prejudice. When is the last time you did something kind for yourself? When is the last time you had a decent meal and decent sleep? When is the last time you gave yourself Grace and allowed yourself to feel all the emotions that I know have to be overwhelming you right now? When is the last time you felt like you liked or even loved yourself? These are things you need to think about and address, way before you even remotely think about your mom or brother. That is not selfish.\n\nI made a promise to a 12 year old girl when I first found out how sick I was. I promised her that I would fight tooth and nail, even walk through hellfire, to stay alive for as long as she needed me. That girl is now 30ish!!! Came real close to breaking that promise in 2017 and was told I shocked the surgeons who saved my life, because there was no way I should have been alive. But I still remember fishing in heaven with my mama and being ORDERED to go back, and waking up to my daughter's stressed out, angry voice ringing in my ear \"MA! YOU PROMISED!\". And I remember trying to answer her around the tube down my throat, with my hands tied up on the rails of the hospital bed; trying to tell her \"I know, Baby Girl. I'm right here. I am not going anywhere yet!\". Of course, all that came out was \"gurglegurgle\", but she could take my hand and I tried to squeeze as hard as my weak little butt could to reassure her.\n\nI've had 8 surgeries this year. Every time, I tell the surgeon, \"See you on the other side\" and she tells me \"You die on my table, I'll kill you myself!\". The nurses get exasperated with me because I will not stay put and I'm doing laps around the hallways. Because I know that moving, being compliant with my treatment program and my diet keeps me alive. God will call me home in His time. Until then, I am fighting tooth and nail to keep that promise to my daughter.\n\nNow, you need to think about that for a moment. If you go haring off to the beck and call of your mom and your brother, do you honestly thing that you are going to be there for your kids as long as they need you to be? No, because you are going to expend precious resources on them when you should be expending them on yourself and your kids.\n\nNo is a complete sentence. If you want to help your brother, encourage him to go make an account at [Davita.com](https://Davita.com). There are some nifty tools and resources on their website that will help him learn how to manage his dietary needs, exercise and fluid restrictions. It will even have resources for free classes and seminars so that he can be put in touch with other patients who will help support him in learning how to live with and manage his CKD. It even has this nifty food analyzer that tells you the breakdown on things like potassium, calcium, salt, and phosphorus contents. (Potassium is quite poisonous to CKD patients in high amounts)\n\nNow, final and MOST IMPORTANT THING! You need to make an appointment with your doctor, or a doctor, as soon as possible. Have them run a complete renal (kidney) panel as well as a full chemistry panel on you. Because kidney disease usually runs in families. So, you need to be checked as well. You have a higher risk because you are a woman.  You also have a higher risk of complications due to being a woman and having had kids. Your system has already been stressed. Get checked. Then check out the [Davita.com](https://Davita.com) website. Be proactive. Walk. Make little lifestyle changes that include dietary and exercise changes. Focus on yourself and your kids. BECOME SELFISH AND SELF CENTERED FOR THEM! Because trust me, you want to be able to be 90 years old and showing the great-grandkids something your grandkids and kids will be absolutely tearing their hair out over while cackling madly with glee. (Think one of them is 18 and you just taught them how to do doughnuts in the mall parking lot or how to go mudding in Pop's new truck level of shenanigans).\n\nNow, take a deep breath. In and out. Just breathe. I promise you, the sun will shine again for you. For right now, while it's all stormy out for you, take this time to learn how to be a Willow Tree. So that when the storms of life hit, you DANCE in them, bending and swaying but never, ever breaking.\n\nMay the Earth Mother embrace you and give you a path full of love, light, laughter, joy and a peaceful soul. May you walk in Beauty, always.\n\nLove and hugs, Dear One.", "NTA \n\nThey don't want you there because they love and miss you (which still wouldn't obligate a move) but to use you. Stay away and take care of yourself and your kids.", "NTA \n\nSounds like they want you to be a carer for your brother, or even that your mum is lining you up to be the replacement child if your brother sadly goes and she's left on her own. Stay away for your own sake.\n\nYour mum can hire a carer for your brother, and he might be able to claim some kind of disability benefits which could help with finances.

I think you are reading this correctly.\nI\u2019m curious, are you the only daughter?", "NTA Don't do this! They will have your working as a chauffeur, ATM, cleaner and 24 hour carer.

I really needed to read this because it was made out to be damn near life or death. And the guilt of not going home when everything else happened has been another guilt trip she has been laying on me. I don\u2019t want to go home, I\u2019m not going home because although my brother is mentally disable is some instance he is not dumb. I have my own child with mental health and behavioral issues and reentering the toxic lifestyle we left would undo all the hard work I have put in to her progress. It has taken me all year to shake the toxic relationship I was in before so I\u2019m not doing it. I really appreciate you for give me this and o will be praying for you as well.", "I am the only daughter from my mother but I have a minimum of thirty cousins that live there and the surrounding cities.

The next time your mom tries to lay that crap on you, you tell her that you know someone who is ESRD, living with CKD since 2004 and that her trying to tell you it's life or death right now is BS. Then ask her, what is his percentage of kidney function? What are his potassium and phosphorus and calcium numbers? Has he seen a nutritionist? Has he changed his diet? If she starts hemming and hawing, not able to answer those basic questions, you say \"That's what I thought. You just want ME to deal with everything and take care of you both. NO. Do not ask me again and consider the subject closed for discussion!\". Block her on a time out, if needed. YOU HAVE TO PRIORITIZE YOURSELF AND YOUR KID(S)!. Not your circus, not your monkey.
