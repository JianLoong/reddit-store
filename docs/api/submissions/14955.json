You have every right to not want that at your wedding. But it sounds like the parents might not take it too well, her being spoiled and all. This is something you're REALLY going to have to stand your ground on. \n\nAlso, I've never been married, but I've heard that people use their wedding coordinator to keep things flowing. Have the coordinator there and they can be the one to stop the childs performance when its supposed to be over and move on.", "NTA - my kids are about that age. I think it\u2019s sweet y\u2019all are so open to her participating and including her. But it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask mom and dad to remind her that it\u2019s YOUR special day, and to make sure she is on her best behavior and not be disruptive.", "Annnnnnd this right here is why people have childfree weddings. Or elope. \n\nYour niece can be disappointed that she is *not invited to your wedding*. She will get over it. If you try to limit her to \u201cfive minutes\u201d\u2026 well, good luck with that.\n\nAnd anybody that is upset be her lack of invitation, well, they can be uninvited, *too*. And good luck. Remember who is paying for your wedding. If it is *you*, then *you* make the guest list. \n\nNTA", "NTA for not wanting that at your wedding. Be good natured about telling her parents that you\u2019re arranging entertainment and little cousin shouldn\u2019t expect to take over.", "NTA. I didn't want my little cousin for my flower girl because she pulled a similar stunt at another cousin's wedding. She acted out because people were paying more attention to the bride than to her. So we told the family that we'd already asked a family friend's daughter.\n\nThat whole branch of the family boycotted my wedding, partly because of that. (The other part was they were unwilling to attend a Catholic mass. It might corrupt their pure Southern Baptist purity.)", "NTA. You're going to have to have a child free wedding unless you want that kid to take over no matter what other barriers you try to put in place. She's going to try to catch the bouquet and when she doesn't she's going to have a tantrum. And God forbid you don't make her a flower girl. Make it easier on yourself and eliminate children from the wedding altogether.", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly this is the reason why weddings are trending to be child free more and more and honestly it's a shame because i have well behaved children that I hate that I'll probably never have the chance to enjoy a wedding with.  Parents can't or won't control their children", "Definitely NTA\n\nIt seems like you just want your wedding to run smoothly and peacefully, it's not like you hate the child or anything like that so your concerns about her performing at your wedding are quite valid especially since you mentioned how she behaved at your grandpa's birthday.\n\nBut if push comes to shove and she has to perform at your wedding, try to make sure she gives a short performance.\n\nOverall, I don't think you're in the wrong in this situation", "Why not have a child free wedding. Nip that behavior in the bud. You would be the AH if you continue to allow that type of behavior.", "NTA. Make it a no kids wedding. This kiddo will ruin your wedding.", "Someone already brought up a wedding coordinator. If you don't have one, get one ASAP or appoint the MOH or the best man to make sure things flow.\n\nShut this down now and make sure the family knows the timeline of what's happening and when. Don't give wiggle room for them to squeeze in their little events. In fact, I personally wouldn't let the little girl do a 5 minute performance. It *will* go over 5 minutes.", "NTA", "Nta, but be prepared when, not if, when, this kid is allowed to do whatever she wants on your big day regardless of what you want. Her parents who spoil her are likely not going to want, and/or be able to stop her from acting out like that.\n\nIf it was me, I'd be making my wedding CF over this.", "NTA.
