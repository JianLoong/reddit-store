He can get around on his own, it\u2019s just more convenient for us since I\u2019m able to run most of the errands.\n\n\nAnyway dad has two cars, one has manual shift and the other is auto. Due to his mobility issues dad can\u2019t drive the manual, so it\u2019s usually me who\u2019s driving it. Also my workplace is 2 hours away from where I live, it\u2019s not a massive deal for me.\n\n\nI also have a coworker (40F) who relies on me for the rides even though it\u2019s a 20 minute drive from her home to the workplace. So I pick her up and drop her off. She doesn\u2019t have a car and public transportation is crappy in our area, and I also don\u2019t charge her for rides since I pass her street on my way either way. She just checks the location app and goes out whenever she sees I\u2019m approaching her place. Or sometimes I park in her driveway.\n\n\nRecently the manual car wasn\u2019t starting so I had to take the auto car. It\u2019s a really large SUV and I\u2019m not very comfortable with driving it. I\u2019ve been driving the manual car since high school and it\u2019s a super tiny coupe so I\u2019m used to smaller cars. It was literally my 1st time ever driving another car. Also the manual car is an import and it\u2019s RHD, so my perception is slightly off when I drive a normal car.\n\n\nSo she asked me to go in her driveway and since I was driving the larger car I messed up and accidentally hit the lawn with 2 of the wheels bc I\u2019m used to sitting on another side and bc the auto car is wider than the manual one. Her driveway is super narrow and as I said I\u2019m not familiar with driving huge cars so it was a mess up on my end.\n\n\nAnyway she saw the tire tracks on her lawn and was really pissed. She yelled at me saying that if I can\u2019t go in the driveway without hitting the lawn I should get my license revoked. I explained that I couldn\u2019t take my car bc it broke. She said that in this case I had to ask my dad to drive me to work. I got pissed bc it was an unreasonable demand, 1st of all my dad is disabled, 2nd he wouldn\u2019t be super thrilled about spending 4 hours behind the wheel just to take me to the work and back.\n\n\nSo next day I texted her I won\u2019t be giving her rides anymore. I still drive the auto car bc in the manual car a part broke and it needs to be delivered from overseas so it takes time. I won\u2019t deny that maybe it was an overreaction on my part. But I feel hurt by her comment and also I don\u2019t want to go in her driveway again, hit the lawn and get yelled at again. I\u2019m not losing anything if I refuse to give her rides. And I feel like she should\u2019ve been more grateful. Anyway she was angry and called me a bitch. Our other coworker said I\u2019m an asshole because the 40F really needs the rides.

They can call you whatever names they want, but if you bite the hand that feeds you that hand doesn't come back. And your friend is learning that the hard way.\n\nYou are not responsible for a freeloader to get to work. If the other friend is that upset saying she needs a ride let them drive her. It's so easy to get mad at someone doing a favor of somebody because it means you don't have to.\n\nDon't give her anymore rides. Don't pay heed to the people who are complaining about it.

She's just gonna think that she can just walk all over you and just apologize again because you forgave her.", "NTA\n\nShe basically decided that she has the right not only to tell you to stop driving, but to demand that someone else drive you to work and STILL pick her up. Anyone who doesn't see that this is not your problem needs to just keep quiet. Barring that, just ignore them. Also, don't make excuses for people with wild tempers. That's what abuse victims do. It's not healthy.", "NTA. Oh no! The person who is my free taxi accidentally put tyre tracks on my lawn! My entitlement radar is beeping very fast. Grow up and tell her fair and square.

Her problem regarding transport isn't your problem.", "NTA\n\nYour coworker is toxic, both cars belong to your father who has a disability not you personally anyway. Both you and your father seem to be kind and generous people, but it\u2019s not really fair to either of you to have you (and his cars) exploited by an insensitive toxic and entitled coworker who is TA as is the other coworker who bullied you about your response/decision.\n\nFree rides are over.\n\nIf the coworker was a friend or family member of you and/or your father\u2019s and provided him/y\u2019all with services in exchange for the free daily work taxi service and your dad was okay with your using his vehicles to do this everyday, that might be one thing, but as your father is a person with a disability who partly relies upon you to help him out with some errands and transportation even though he can do most things fine on his own, he may still feel some pressure to say yes to some requests even if the requests are things he might feel like are low key exploitative or taking advantage of someone else\u2019s resource and kindness (like the free taxi service).\n\nGood luck, OP! You are NTA but hopefully you ask permission before you use the vehicle of an adult family member with a vehicle in order to regularly transport an unrelated adult coworker to her job everyday for free.

Nevermind the person literally doing you TWO FAVORS A DAY (and yes it is two favors, one ride to work and one back home). Even if it is not extra work for you apart from stopping the car, still you are doing her a favor.\n\nAnd yes, we all make mistakes, and she might have had a really bad day or whatever - but she hasn't apologized, not made any amends. Instead she doubled down and wanted your disabled dad to spend his entire day in a car just so her life would not be affected. F that.\n\nIf you agree on giving her rides again, start charging for gas. You do spend (although very little) extra when stopping extra. Plus you have to be aware of stopping and it sounds like you do need to also wait for her at least some times. That is time and energy taken from you that only benefits her.", "Nta. Your coworker feels you need your licence revoked because you made a mistake. As she feels that way and you are still driving the car she feels insafe in, you xan't in good conscience take her.\n\n And you can't ask your disabled father to inconvenience himself to solve her problem. He might be her solution but only at unwarranted financial, time and probably physical cost to herself. How much is she willing to compensate him for it in fuel and wages? Nothing? Ah so sad then.\n\nYou don't diss people you are getting favours from. She might have been right to be annoyed at tire marks and fair to be up earlier so you don't need to park up to wait for her.

Coworker is not necessarily toxic, abusive or a bad person. But she did have a bad reaction to your mistake. If it were me, I would tell her she can have a ride again when she apologizes, and that \"three strikes and she out\", meaning if she chooses to unload on you two more times she can find a permanent way to get to work.

I\u2019d offer to go through insurance if I was driving. But I wouldn\u2019t expect to be insulted like that.", "NTA.  You've been doing her a favour giving her rides.  Even though it's not out of your way, she should be pitching in for gas each week.  She has a right to be upset about her lawn, but her reaction was over the top.  Maybe a bit of time taking the bus will teach her to check that temper.  \n\nGoing forward, if you start giving her rides again once your car is fixed, I would tell her that she has to help pay for gas.  Maybe that will also help remind her that what you are doing is a favour to her and to watch what she says.", "NTA I'd tell her my licence got revoked cuz of the lawn accident, isn't that what you wanted?", "NTA. She said you shouldn\u2019t have a license, so why should she be in the car that you are driving?", "Definitely NTA at all.\n\nThat said, a 4 hour commute each day is insane and it absolutely does affect you. That would have to be one heck of a job to make it worth it. Gas and maintenance must be astronomical.Estimating 100 miles each way, that's 1000 miles a week which $650 in costs (in the US anyway). It's also 20 hours wasted in a car.\n\nI get that you may not have a lot of choices in your small town, but anything you could do to shorten that commute would hep your life immensely", "NTA\n\n\nHope she enjoys having to use that crappy transportation  system or the cab fees from now on\u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude17\ud83e\udd0c", "NTA\n\nYou were doing her a favour.

I understand that you feel bad, I too have been guilty of not establishing clear boundaries with free loaders, it\u2019s easily done when you want to be kind and helpful but don\u2019t have the luxury of hindsight. You now have been given that, as your coworker has waved their red flag in your face. You left tracks on her grass by accident while doing her a favour. Since she doesn\u2019t chip in for fuel and is getting a free service, the least she could have done is say \u2018it\u2019s ok, I\u2019m just grateful for all this help, I\u2019ll reset the lawn easy enough\u2019. Sounds like she\u2019s gone way past the \u2018grateful\u2019 stage (if she ever at that point!) into \u2018entitled\u2019. She\u2019s gotten so accustomed to your kindness that she now perceives it as her right. You did the right thing in stopping helping her.

Be done with this entitled witch and her flying monkeys!!", "No overreaction. NTA. She was leeching on you. Even if you pick her up on the way, she could throw in some gas money once in a while.

And now she is complaining to your coworkers that \"you\" don't want to drive \"her\" to work anymore, after she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want you to drive her.\n\nIf I'm being picked up by somebody who turns out to be a bad driver, I do my damnedest best not to distract them or stress them out with criticism, and then I arrange alternative transportation going forward. It's clear from her actions she doesn't consider you a bad driver, just a bully. Anyway, you don't owe her any explanation, because she's not entitled to anything.\n\nAs for your coworkers, just tell her she made it abundantly clear she doesn't want you to drive her, she only wants your dad to drive her. No, you didn't pass on that request , it would take your dad 4 hours per day and you would never even dream as asking something so entitled, especially since you're borrowing his car and he could easily take that away from you if you were starting to act that entitled. But if they think the reqeust is reasonable, then surely they can drive her, since she only lives 20 minutes from work so at most it would take your coworkers 80mins per day to ferry her, which is still way way more reasonable than 4 hours. And no, she hasn't apologized or taken back her words,  thanks for asking by the way, but her words were deeply hurtful to you and it's just too stressful for you to drive a car with such an emotional person next to you. That's just how she is? Well, if they're comfortable with that kind of behaviour, they can drive her. Well, that's just how you are, a poor and nervous drivers who can't sit next to such emotional people.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't Burger King and co-worker can't have it her way.
