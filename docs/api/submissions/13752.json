You made a reservation and you shouldn't wait. 5 minutes to set up the table is fine, 30 minutes because they're too busy and didn't actually reserve your table isn't. That's the whole point of reservations. \n\nThe server was wrong for chastising you. You weren't being rude, you were giving constructive criticism on your experience.

I find waiting for 10 minutes reasonable, 15 minutes acceptable but 30 minutes is highly unprofessional", "NTA\n\nYou weren't aggressive about it.

The YTAs here are so weird. You were very polite and the server was totally unprofessional and rude in response.

Do all you people just jump straight to \u201cI want to speak to your manager\u201d??? That is way ruder and more confrontational than what you said. And waiting 30 minutes after your reservation time is bad service, no question.", "NTA. If it was a walk-in? Sure. But you had a reservation. That\u2019s what they\u2019re there for.

Being busy and honoring reservations is the restaurant\u2019s job. \nThe servicer should have simply apologized. You are paying for quality.", "NTA. I ran customer service for years, and I would never let an employee get away with talking to a customer like that. Let alone a server in a high end restaurant.", "T I bet the server made her comment after her tip was taken care of NTA", "NTA waiting 5 minutes? Sure no problem.\n\nWaiting 10-15 min, well okay.\n\nWaiting anymore than that and it\u2019s into complimentary drinks/desserts and so on territory.

However\u2026 let me quickly explain something about reservations\u2026\n\nA 6:00 reservation may mean they need to leave that table empty for one hour prior.  Meaning they lose the use of a table for an hour. They would need to leave it open to ensure nobody is sitting there when you arrive. If they put someone there at 5:00 those people could easily linger until 6:30\u2026.

I think you're asking about dining etiquette here and while it's annoying to have to wait that long with a reservation, it's not unusual for things to come up sometimes (it sounds like this is the first time this has happened there). You also know that the food server is not in charge of how many bookings the restaurant takes. Why complain to them? It's unlikely they're going to take the complaint to their management.

Next time however if they say there will be a wait, mention in a nice but concerned tone that you scheduled your babysitter for your special night out based upon your reservation time and ask how long they expect the wait to be.  The host and/or manager can sometimes juggle things and if they know you're on a deadline there's a chance they'll make sure you're seated sooner.

It wasn\u2019t the waitresses fault so why complain to her? Even if it was \u201cpolite\u201d. No need to bring it up. The complaint if anything should go to management. But also 30 minutes to wait is nothing.", "A lot of people get a table then stay there for 2-3 hours. If someone got sat there at 4 and were still there at 6 it\u2019s not the restaurant\u2019s fault.", "Yeah the ability to resolve a problem on the spot is actually another way to assess the restaurant. Even if there was a problem, but they fixed it, I\u2019ll be back and try them again.", "I would wrap up \u201cSo how was everything?\u201d And, \u201cOh. Well, that\u2019s not my department,\u201d is not a great way to respond to out of scope complaints.", "10-15 mins is forgivable. 30 is enough to make you miss curtain time so worth complaining about. Can you tell I worked in theater district?", "> I waited, personally (pretty standard) - it's def not normal to have to wait that long for a reservation.\n\nLol, thanks for the gibberish.  Taken from here by a comment-copying bot:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128znsp/comment/jelbcr1/", "Sure but the server going \u201cHey table 12 complained about their long wait time\u201d to the manager vs the manager hearing directly from the guest would be more likely to have an actual impact.", "What would complaining directly to the manager change, other than making a bigger scene? Vs. the server passing the feedback on.", ">  That task lies with management. \n\nI don't know about you, but in the restaurants around me, the servers are employed by and are representatives of the management. How does it work where you live? Are servers hired by a third party?", "Where did she BLAME the server for the wait time?"]}
