As a former sever, I think your server could have handled the interaction better. It\u2019s never a good tactic to tell a customer not to complain (WTF?! \u201cBe grateful we let you have a seat at all?\u201d) \n\nI would have extended apologies on behalf of the restaurant and assured you I would pass your feedback on to the manager. I would have tried to bring it back to a happy place, ie: \u201cAt least it was worth the wait?\u201d Since you complimented the food and service. \n\nIf you complained before the bill I might have found you a free dessert or dessert shot from the bar.", "NTA. You made a reservation and you shouldn't wait. 5 minutes to set up the table is fine, 30 minutes because they're too busy and didn't actually reserve your table isn't. That's the whole point of reservations. \n\nThe server was wrong for chastising you. You weren't being rude, you were giving constructive criticism on your experience. And you thanked her for the good parts. \n\nEsp since you have 3 kids, you wanted your dining to be timely, and it's irresponsible that they didn't actually ***reserve*** your table when you made reservations.", "NTA, you had a reservation, they're supposed to set aside a table for you. If you had a 30 minute wait they had not done that", "This is a wobbler: you're NTA for saying something about the wait, because that's just bad management. \n\nBut speaking to your server? That's AH behavior, solely because your server has no control over something like that. Speaking to the host/hostess, or the manager - that's the right answer. \n\nCalling the next day to complain is also appropriate, as long as you're polite about it and reasonable.", "NTA. Especially for a 6pm sitting. Sounds like they overbooked.", "NTA. I find waiting for 10 minutes reasonable, 15 minutes acceptable but 30 minutes is highly unprofessional", "NTA\n\nYou weren't aggressive about it. She was a bit in response - and she should have alerted the manager. I would have expected a comped glass of wine and an app while I waited, personally (pretty standard) - it's def not normal to have to wait that long for a reservation.", "NTA\n\nRegardless of whether they were slammed or not, if they're working in a higher end spot, that's a completely inappropriate answer.", "NTA. The YTAs here are so weird. You were very polite and the server was totally unprofessional and rude in response. The people saying it wasn\u2019t her fault are bizarre - it was the restaurant\u2019s fault and she was an employee of the restaurant with whom you were interacting. Do all you people just jump straight to \u201cI want to speak to your manager\u201d??? That is way ruder and more confrontational than what you said. And waiting 30 minutes after your reservation time is bad service, no question.", "NTA. If it was a walk-in? Sure. But you had a reservation. That\u2019s what they\u2019re there for. To make sure you have an available table saved for you at the time you book.", "Nope. Nta -former hostess", "Nope I don\u2019t think you are either. It\u2019s reasonable to expect with a reservation you\u2019re seated at that time. If they can\u2019t quite make it, they should tell you upon arrival and do some expectation management.", "NTA\nI prob would have dropped the tip for their response. Being busy and honoring reservations is the restaurant\u2019s job. \nThe servicer should have simply apologized. You are paying for quality.", "NTA. I ran customer service for years, and I would never let an employee get away with talking to a customer like that. Let alone a server in a high end restaurant.", "T I bet the server made her comment after her tip was taken care of NTA", "NTA waiting 5 minutes? Sure no problem.\n\nWaiting 10-15 min, well okay.\n\nWaiting anymore than that and it\u2019s into complimentary drinks/desserts and so on territory. The longer the wait the more expensive the item.", "NTA.  You had a reservation so waiting more than 10 minutes for your table is not right. However\u2026 let me quickly explain something about reservations\u2026\n\nA 6:00 reservation may mean they need to leave that table empty for one hour prior.  Meaning they lose the use of a table for an hour. They would need to leave it open to ensure nobody is sitting there when you arrive. If they put someone there at 5:00 those people could easily linger until 6:30\u2026. So honestly it\u2019s tough for them which is why some restaurants won\u2019t allow reservations", "ESH\n\nThe server did not handle that the way she should have. She could have just bitten her tongue and not acknowledged it\n\nAt the same time, if you really wanted to complain you should have asked for the manager. The servers literally have ZERO control over the work flow. Venting to her was a bit shitty", "NAH.", "YTA. Your server was not the reason for the wait. If you have a complaint like that, take it to management.", "YTA for telling this to the waitress and not asking for a manager or telling the host the waitress had nothing to do with it and there was nothing she could do about it so you were just being mean to her for no reason and she has enough to worry about without whiney customers.", "YTA: It wasn't the server's fault. Restaurants are still experiencing massive staffing issues. A little kindness goes a long way.", "YTA. The server isn\u2019t responsible for all the shit that happened.", "YTA\n\nIt was \"only\" 30minutes. I think really fancy and popular restaurants can have even longer wait times than that.\n\nYour dinner was already over there was no point in bringing it up at all and even less to the waitress who had absolutely nothing to do with that.", "YTA -  you should\u2019ve complained to the manager.  The server could\u2019ve handled it better also", "YTA. Don't make a complaint at the end of your meal when there is nothing that can be done anymore to fix it. If you had brought it up with the manager at the beginning of your meal they could have given you a free appetizer but instead you waited to the end and complained to the one person not responsible.", "YTA, you\u2019re complaining to the wrong person.", "YTA. I think you're asking about dining etiquette here and while it's annoying to have to wait that long with a reservation, it's not unusual for things to come up sometimes (it sounds like this is the first time this has happened there). You also know that the food server is not in charge of how many bookings the restaurant takes. Why complain to them? It's unlikely they're going to take the complaint to their management. It wasn't the classiest way to handle it although you were polite enough--- you're not actually an asshole, but you're asking for judgement on your dining etiquette.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Bad start to the night.", "The server's response was uncalled for and unprofessional. But again, she has zero control of the pacing and flow of customers. There is literally nothing she could have done to make the wait shorter. That task lies with management. So unless op wanted to say something to the manager, all she did was make a comment to the server. And when working in a fast paced and high stress environment where each customer has expectations that conflict with others, comments like that are not a solution and only stress out the worker", "i agree that the server doesn't have control over it. i think op's point wasn't to actually make a systematic change in the restaurant. sometimes when we experience something negative, we want to tell *someone* who will listen, just to get it out of our system. op, wanting to complain, i'm sure didn't want to make a big deal out of it. so she just passively complained to her server. \n\nyeah, op could've done to the manager. but that wouldn't have changed anything either. the manager would've just said sorry instead of the server. \n\ni feel sorry for servers who have to deal with complaints. i hope they know it's not their job to fix it, and customers are just using them as a sounding board for their feelings. it's important for servers to have mature emotional processing to understand \"this isn't personal and it isn't actually MY problem\""]}
