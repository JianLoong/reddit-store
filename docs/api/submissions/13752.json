You made a reservation and you shouldn't wait. 5 minutes to set up the table is fine, 30 minutes because they're too busy and didn't actually reserve your table isn't. That's the whole point of reservations. \n\nThe server was wrong for chastising you. You weren't being rude, you were giving constructive criticism on your experience.

The YTAs here are so weird. You were very polite and the server was totally unprofessional and rude in response.

Do all you people just jump straight to \u201cI want to speak to your manager\u201d??? That is way ruder and more confrontational than what you said. And waiting 30 minutes after your reservation time is bad service, no question.", "NTA. If it was a walk-in? Sure. But you had a reservation. That\u2019s what they\u2019re there for.

Let alone a server in a high end restaurant.", "T I bet the server made her comment after her tip was taken care of NTA", "NTA waiting 5 minutes? Sure no problem.\n\nWaiting 10-15 min, well okay.\n\nWaiting anymore than that and it\u2019s into complimentary drinks/desserts and so on territory.

However\u2026 let me quickly explain something about reservations\u2026\n\nA 6:00 reservation may mean they need to leave that table empty for one hour prior.  Meaning they lose the use of a table for an hour. They would need to leave it open to ensure nobody is sitting there when you arrive. If they put someone there at 5:00 those people could easily linger until 6:30\u2026.

I think you're asking about dining etiquette here and while it's annoying to have to wait that long with a reservation, it's not unusual for things to come up sometimes (it sounds like this is the first time this has happened there). You also know that the food server is not in charge of how many bookings the restaurant takes. Why complain to them? It's unlikely they're going to take the complaint to their management.

Next time however if they say there will be a wait, mention in a nice but concerned tone that you scheduled your babysitter for your special night out based upon your reservation time and ask how long they expect the wait to be.

If someone got sat there at 4 and were still there at 6 it\u2019s not the restaurant\u2019s fault.", "Yeah the ability to resolve a problem on the spot is actually another way to assess the restaurant.

Well, that\u2019s not my department,\u201d is not a great way to respond to out of scope complaints.", "10-15 mins is forgivable. 30 is enough to make you miss curtain time so worth complaining about. Can you tell I worked in theater district?", "> I waited, personally (pretty standard) - it's def not normal to have to wait that long for a reservation.\n\nLol, thanks for the gibberish.  Taken from here by a comment-copying bot:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128znsp/comment/jelbcr1/", "Sure but the server going \u201cHey table 12 complained about their long wait time\u201d to the manager vs the manager hearing directly from the guest would be more likely to have an actual impact.", "What would complaining directly to the manager change, other than making a bigger scene? Vs. the server passing the feedback on.", ">  That task lies with management. \n\nI don't know about you, but in the restaurants around me, the servers are employed by and are representatives of the management. How does it work where you live? Are servers hired by a third party?", "Where did she BLAME the server for the wait time?", "Career server/bartender here. NTA. I get it. It happens. It\u2019s happened to me. I ALWAYS try to do something for the people. Free round of drinks or an appetizer. Anything over ten minutes is too long.", "As someone who has worked extensively in customer service I always question what and how the comment was made. It\u2019s about perception. If you were snippy or rude and met back with that attitude than you are in fact the ah.

Gentle YTA. \nI currently serve in a restaurant that sounds like this one, and sometimes it is impossible to get tables to leave because you can only do so much to politely push a table out on time. \nI would have taken that complaint to the manager, that is entirely outside of your server\u2019s control (just like a complaint about how your food is cooked)", "YTA.\n\nThe server doesn't have anything to do with the wait time. That should have been something you talked to the hostess or manager about, not added more weight to the servers' shoulders.", "NTA. I\u2019d be pissed about a 30-minute wait after booking a reservation.", "NTA as long as you were polite about it. restaurants can try their best to correctly pace tables to have tables available for reservations, and sometimes things get screwed up because the previous tables\u2019 food takes too long, or people just take forever to eat. But the correct response on the part of the restaurant is to at least acknowledge the issue and offer you something for the wait.", "while the time of the reservation seems very early to be subject to such a wait, there could possibly have been a party who decided to linger longer than expected, occupying a table that was reserved for another party coming in behind them. I'm curious, even if someone has a reservation, does that dictate how long they can stay at the table, or is there a set time they're expected to eat and leave? like, possibly, an hour, taking into consideration perusing the menu, ordering, having drinks brought, food arriving, eating, dessert, coffee? (I rarely go out to dine, and usually by myself, last meal I sat in for I was probably out within an hour - order, go get a drink from the bar, wait, eat)", "ESH\n\nThe server's response was awful, but frankly not a word of this should have been breathed to your server.  Who you could almost certainly *see* was overworked on a night like that.  After a stressful night, she was burned out and took your comment personally.  Again, that's really not great, but read the room.  If you want to complain, do so to a manager.  What the hell do you want the server to do about it?\n\nThe complaint itself *is* reasonable, 30 minutes is not okay on a reservation.  It was just directed to the wrong person.  Talk to someone responsible and with the power to actually *do* anything about your complaint.  The server's got other things to do and you don't need to tie up her time (and thus that of other patrons as well) with something she's not responsible for.", "NTA but tells me you must not go out frequently to these types of places, at least post pandemic. \n\nPretty much every restaurant, even the mid tier $30-$50 plate ones, seem to have a lingering staffing issue. That, coupled with the increasing amount of \u2018campers\u2019 that now feel like they need to spend extra time at the restaurant to make the wait they endured worthwhile makes this a common occurrence. \n\nIf you do happen to get seated within 20-30 minutes of your reservation time around here you end up spending the same amount of time before you\u2019ve finished ordering drinks and they come around to take the actual meal order. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly affected us enough times to where when we do make plans to go out to eat I plan to block off at least 2 hours of the day (hour for pre-seat wait + post seat wait, 40 minutes for food to arrive, 20 minutes to eat and wrap up drinks / bill). Almost want to start having a pre-dinner protein snack.", "NTA That Comment would have cost her a tip", "Oh no. NTA. The entire point of a reservation is so you don\u2019t have to wait.", "Do you really have nothing better to complain about? I want your life,", "The Y-TAs are acting like you were blaming the server for the wait. Why in the world would you ask for a manager just to complain about the wait when your dinner was already over? \n\nNTA", "If they were busier than normal, that means they either overbooked or a walk-in got your table. Restaurant\u2019s fault, and the server should have handled that much better. NTA", "NTA. Reservation means the restaurant should reserve the table so you don't have to wait... at least not that long.", "NTA, and as a server myself that server did a pisspoor job of handling a reasonable complaint, especially since you complimented them right before.\n\nAnyone saying you should\u2019ve tracked down the manager and told them directly has never worked in a restaurant bc every server I know would rather avoid having someone angrily run around the restaurant trying to find someone, when they could just pass it along themselves.\n\nAlso, rule numero UNO for being a server, is that any complaint; especially ones that aren\u2019t about your service, go to the manager *before* you respond. Having to deal with angry people is part of the job and you didn\u2019t even sound that angry.\n\nThe perfect world is one where you ask for the manager and then complain to them, so I guess what you did is *slightly* more AH behavior, (though still completely reasonable) but the server is the way bigger jerk here.", "NTA, but telling your server was unnecessary. She has no control over the wait. You should have spoken to the manager, either during dinner or called the next day.", "YTA. Also, I have seriously serious doubts that's what the server said.", "That's like when the internet goes down. YTA", "NTA. You made a reservation at a time, the restaurant gives you a table at that time. Period. There isn\u2019t two ways about it. If they were planning to make you wait, they shouldn\u2019t have taken a reservation in the first place\nTalking to a server as if it\u2019s their fault isn\u2019t great but I\u2019m guessing it does get conveyed to the actual people responsible, so it works out.", "Especially if you have a reservation!", "These doesn\u2019t seem like a take from an American perspective. But idk where this took place.", "30 minutes is unacceptable if you have a reservation. For an expensive place, that's free dessert/drinks territory.\n\nFor most diners, the server is the \"client facing\" person in the restaurant. Complaints (which should be spoken politely) go to the server so they can pass it on to the person responsible. The server isn't cooking the food either, but they ask how your food is.\n\nIn this case, the server should have apologized on behalf of the restaurant and passed the complaint onto the manager as soon as possible. Any good manager of an expensive restaurant would have immediately come out to apologize to the table and offer them a free dessert or comp something from the check.\n\nThere is a level of service/hospitality expected especially at expensive restaurants and the restaurant would know not to piss off diners and try to make any issue right before the diner goes home and tells others.", "Agreed. I served in a fine dining restaurant years ago, and if my manager ever found out I said something like that to a guest, I probably would have been fired.", "They do, but telling the server is the wrong move. You either talk to a manager that day, or call in the next day. \nYour server already deals with people complaining about tons of things they don\u2019t control, don\u2019t add to the pule", "Any expensive restaurant should have staff that is trained well enough that they know how to handle issues like this without being snippy or rude. That is the mark of a true high class establishment.", "Nah, she just wanted to waste the server's time with something she has no power over (though yes, server's response was terrible).  But the manager was *exactly* the person to bring her (extremely valid) complaint to.  It's possible to speak quietly with the manager and not make a big scene.", "I've never been rushed out of a truly high end restaurant.  And rarely from cheaper restaurants that wanted to think of themselves as high end.  That's pretty appalling.", "If the server relates something like this to the manager, I would hope the manager would then go out voluntarily and speak to the table and not need the table demand \"I want to speak to the manager\". Or worst case, send the server back with his apologies and comp something on the menu or send a free drink/dessert.", ">\tI would hope the manager would then go out voluntarily\n\nNotice how you said \u201cI hope\u201d. I\u2019ve had that happen to me where I (as a worker) express an issue to Managment & by the time they get over there, the guest is gone. Probably because they felt they got their point across. And now, nothing can be done. If you ask for the manager directly, you\u2019d be more likely to have a direct communication. If this happened to me I\u2019d say to the server, \u201cYour service was phenomenal, but we had an issue with our reservation earlier. Obviously not your fault, but would you mind getting a manager for us so we can talk to them about it? Thanks\u201d\n\nI really don\u2019t get the hang up on \u201cnever ask to speak to a manager\u201d when there are some things, such as in **this** specific instance, that are absolutely not the server\u2019s responsibility & above her pay grade.", "Fair, if OP was complaining after the check had come, she probably didn't want to delay their eventing any more so just mentioned it to the server instead of waiting for the manager to arrive. And likely, as you say, even if the manager rushed out there, OP probably would have been gone.\n\nThat said, I think the server's response was unprofessional and didn't reflect well on a high end restaurant - which is a big part of the experience. They probably should have just apologized on behalf of the restaurant and offered to fetch a manager (which OP could have refused if they didn't want).", "Where did I SAY she blamed the server?"]}
