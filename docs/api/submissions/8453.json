Always leaving gigantic toilet paper rings on the lid/floor, or when they do the hovering \"It's gross to touch the seat!\" and piss all over the seat and leave it. \n\nAnd just because you mentioned never having had the pleasure of a woman shitting on the walls, my \"I'm a gentile southern Belle!\" almost 7' grandma once managed to completely shit waist high along every wall in a pharmacy bathroom.

At some point the father would go to the washroom, leaving the child alone. In almost every case some stranger would approach  the child, and question them to find out if they were \"safe\", and the girl would say \"of course I'm with my daddy\". If they were both white, the people would leave them alone after she said it it was her dad. If the father was heavily tattooed they pushed harder, and would as him to prove it. If it was a white man with a black daughter they were ignored, but if it was a black father with a white daughter, they called the police  every time. It was infuriating. Fyi the local police knew what was happening beforehand. \n\nI just don't understand the logic of these people, if they are out in public together, why would you think something is wrong, a kidnapper isn't going to take the kid out in public. Ugh.", "Upvoted for clever Phantom Tollbooth reference.", "I worked in a pharmacy when that happened half a lifetime ago. It's truly burned into my memories.", "how do they DO THAT? Like do they just start spinning like a lawn sprinkler from the pressure? how come in stories like that they never aim their brown spray paint into the toilet?"]}
