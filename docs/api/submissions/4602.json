We have been off and on a bit over the course of our relationship but nothing completely toxic. We have met personally but have not yet moved in together because he lives in a different state. I live in an apartment with no roommates. I also have a list of medical issues involving cancer so the money I make working from home majorly goes to apartment and medical bills.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago we had gotten on the topic of money, and I mentioned that I couldn\u2019t watch my favorite shows on Netflix because I could no longer afford it. He started asking me questions about how I spend my money and what I do in my free time. I responded by telling him that I don\u2019t spend my money on anything but necessities because I, like previously stated, cannot afford it due to medical bills.\n\nThe conversation took a turn when he asked me how much I pay for rent for my apartment. I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable telling him because it felt like a personal question to me.\n\nSide note - I grew up in a very poor and broken family so I\u2019ve always had insecurities about money.\n\nI told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable telling him because, like I said, I felt like it was a little bit too personal of a question. We started to argue back and forth about what is and isn\u2019t a personal question and I tried explain that the definition of a personal question varies between person but he didn\u2019t want to listen. He then accused me of lying to him and told me it shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal and he lost trust is me and accused me of not being able to make up a \u201cbelievable lie.\u201d\n\nI gave up trying to explain myself because I knew it would only make me feel worse than I already did. I was already tired from work that day and arguing with him hurts me more and more every time it happens. He is a very logical person and based his opinions on facts and evidence. \n\nI really need to know, AITA?

It's not like you have any plans to move in (and you shouldn't, he sounds like a guy to drop!) so he doesn't need to know all of your business. In a healthy relationship, I might understand being iffy about a partner not being willing to share financial info that could be relevant in the future. But between the age gap, it being an off-an-on relationship, and him getting this upset at you not sharing this info with him... this isn't a healthy relationship.", "NTA. So many red flags", "I just can\u2019t get over the first two sentences. You were a 17 year old dating a 25 year old. You\u2019ve broken up and gotten back together but it\u2019s not \u201ccompletely toxic\u201d which means it\u2019s just normal toxic (which is still quite bad). \n\nBut ignoring all that, asking about how much your partner pays in rent after one year of a relationship is not a personal question, and if you were actually contemplating moving in with this guy or getting a new place that is really important info to know roughly how much each person is expected to pay. You should be able to trust your partner to tell him this info, but it sounds like you don\u2019t trust him well which is very concerning. \n\nYou\u2019re still NTA, but there are so many red flags flying. My personal advise is you cannot move in with this guy, and you should get out of this relationship as fast as possible. The age gap is massive, you two can\u2019t keep the relationship going without falling apart every few months, and it sounds like you get in arguments frequently.", "NTA - that age difference\u2026 \n\nThis is also controlling behavior.", "Yikes on a fucking bike girl. Firstly a 26yo man does not want to be with an 18yo unless he can manipulate them. There will be a reason he cant find someone his own age to date. Please look into age gap relationships and the red flags you should be looking out for, I bet he's waving a bunch you're not seeing.\n\nSecondly, on and off for the first year, if you can't be happy and work through any problems without breaking up in the first year when you're supposed to be obsessed with each other I find it hard to believe you never will.\n\nThirdly you're not the asshole you don't have to answer any questions you don't want to, but how much you pay in rent is not a personal thing to tell your partner of 1 year. Many couples are talking about living together at this stage, thus sharing financial information.  If you don't feel comfortable divulging this information to him then you don't feel safe with him and that's a giant red flag.", "- This relationship started when you were 16-17F and he was 24-25M.\n\n- \u201cNothing completely toxic\u201d - any amount of toxic is too much toxic.\n\n- He repeatedly tried to cross a boundary you set but says *he\u2019s* lost trust in *you*.\n\n- \u201cI gave up trying to explain myself because I knew it would only make me feel worse than I already did.\u201d Oh, no. Oh, you poor thing. OH, NO.\n\n- \u201cHe is a very logical person.\u201d No. That is the excuse he uses for bulldozing you and minimising your feelings.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason this guy can\u2019t get a partner his own age. Run.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIt's none of his business how much you pay because you don't live together and how you budget it up to you as an adult. Plus, you explained why you didn't feel comfortable telling him. His behaviour is a bit concerning though. I'm wondering if this type of reaction is normal for him", "NTA. It's none of his business and unless you are planning to live together, finances are personal and not necessarily open for discussion. \n\nHis behavior in general is full of red flags and it sounds like you have a lot on your plate without dealing with someone who is emotionally manipulative.", "NTA \u2014 you owe him nothing and are under no obligation to tell him what *you* pay for rent or any other bill for that matter.\n\nJust for perspective, *nothing completely toxic* still doesn\u2019t sound good, and there\u2019s a big difference between an 18yo and a 26yo. \n\nI\u2019m not telling you to leave a relationship but just remember that you\u2019re still young with plenty of life ahead of you. No need to tie yourself to someone who makes you uncomfortable with money questions at 18.", "NTA\n\nGirl, get out of there.  To accuse you of not making up a believable lie because you're not comfortable telling him how much your rent is and that he's lost trust in you?   FUUUUUuuck that noise.   \n\nBe glad he showed you how trash he is now, before you're legally bound to him.", "NTA\n\nYou don't need a controlling bf to add to your problems. A supportive bf *of one year* would have just respected your desire to keep your personal finances private. Ditch the on and off guy. You need as much peace of mind as you can get nowadays.\n\nHoping for your full recovery. Hang in there.", "NTA\n\nDump him and go NC. He doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries. You tell him you don\u2019t feel comfortable with something and all he does is double down? He\u2019s power tripping on you. His age worries me, too- why can\u2019t he find someone his own age?\n\nYou don\u2019t need stress or his BS. He knows your medical history- he can and will exploit that. This guy isn\u2019t safe for you. Kick him to the curb and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA, and maybe it sounds cliche judging from one post, but dump him and get out of there while he's still a state away.\n\nYou are perfectly within your right to withhold info like your financial status from even a partner if you're not comfortable sharing so long as its not harming anyone(which its not). Him ignoring your boundaries, getting aggressive and dismissive of you, and then gaslighting you and accusing you of lying. Not even mentioning the age difference here of 26 vs 18 with extra medical and financial burdens that he knows about. These are gigantic red flags with red flashing neon lights.\n\n**DO NOT EVER** allow this person to move in with you, do not allow them any access to your private info, do not put yourself in any sort of situation where they would have power over you. Because your story, minus the extra medical issues, is a textbook case of how abusive relationships start. He's already stated he doesn't trust you and is giving you the silent treatment, use that along with the argument as an easy excuse and get out of that relationship and contact while you still can, because farther down the road trying to leave abusive relationships often ends up with the abuser putting you in the hospital. Don't try to justify it if he tries argue it, because he will, just cut the cord and go silent.", "NTA. Also, I know many other comments have mentioned this but I can\u2019t stress it enough: there are so many red flags here. The relationship has already proven to be volatile and toxic, and I PROMISE you, your older self will thank you for getting out early.", "NTA.  This guy is being controlling and abusive.  You have every right to spend your money on what you want and can.  As long as you're meeting your obligations and he's not putting his money into it, in any way, it's none of his business.  \n\n\nYou're very young to be with someone 26 years old.  My guess is, he either wants to lecture the crap out of you for your expenses, or he wants to offer money so he can extend control over you.  Your instincts in not wanting to share this with him are right on the money.", "Please date someone your own age. This dude is TA for being a groomer.", "NTA the math is not mathing tho, what did a 26 year old have in common with a 17 year old? What does a 27 year old have in common with an 18 year old? Isn't there a classic equation for age differences? Y'all don't pass it, I don't believe.", "Honestly I thought NTA from the moment you mentioned the ages. And I was right. You don't have to disclose that information and he is being at best a dick here and at worst  manipulative.", "Okay, first you aren't living together, he doesn't get to decide what he has a right to know. You talk, you disagree, and you move on. But in your own house - No. Two, if he's logical he would have accepted I can't afford it. That's a really practical argument. Three, if he doesn't make you happy he's failing the basics of a BF role and bye-bye.", "NTA - If you don't trust him to know details about your personal finances that's your decision alone. \n\nHowever - he may be trying to gauge your expenses so that he can help you financially. That you don't mention why he thinks he should know in detail how you spend makes it hard to understand his motives for what he will do if you did decide to open up about your finances.\n\nOff the subject - ever consider that a 26 year old might be a little too old for you? \n\nStrictly speaking - you should be at different places in your lives and that it's a long distance relationship, where does this go assuming if the relationship stays intact?", "NTA.  \"We have met personally but have not yet moved in together\" tells me this is a mostly on-line relationship. \n\nWhile some of you think that divulging financial info is realistic as many would be looking to move in together, I know a couple gals that really got cat-phished and lost a lot of money.  I would be very hesitant to share any financial information with this guy.", "NTA, and he really is very toxic. Your line about him basing his opinions on facts and evidence really stood out. I'm guessing that's how he personally describes himself rather than how he actually is, because there was nothing fact/evidence-based about his accusations toward you. You're uncomfortable with disclosing financial information for understandable reasons. A respectful person would accept that and kindly back down. He did not. When people brag about being fact-based and logical, they're actually just saying that in the hope that other people will take them at their word whenever they spout off about things and not argue. Or they'll *use* facts and logic selectively to twist the argument around.\n\nHe's being cold and distant to punish you for not doing what he wanted. Please cut things off with him. Do not let him have information about you. Don't let him love-bomb you or try to push you into a living situation with him either. He sounds so terrible.", "NTA- your groomer boyfriend is always the ahole based on his age alone. Friend- he is a predator.", "Hard to judge for me.\n\nIf you say you have a good relationship together and it's going places, you should be able to share basic info like rent.  Hes not asking your bank acct amount...\n\nIf you are casual, none of his business.\n\nI have a feeling most will day something about later, but I think YTA if you have a serious relationship amd you wont share your rent amount?  What if they wanted to move to your town for pricing info.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I dont see how it's a big deal.  Seems like he could just call your apt and ask to rent a unit and get the price.\n\nI think you overreacted.  Hes cold because if you cant share basic info he might worry about other things...", "I knew it would be all NTA... \n\nI'm just saying your overreacting.   Your rent is practically public info, I dont see asking that info as a 'red flag'\n\nOther people are stuck on age... that's your deal, I'm not gonna judge that like others.", "If he's not being controlling the age gap is a little weird but not terrible... if you click, you click. Don't let others say shit. If you've been dating him for a year and you won't give him your rent amount what are you doing?

No way. No thank you.
