Victoria sounds like a real piece of work. You had valid reasons for not talking about your relationship with Dylan, not just with her, but with *anyone*.

What the actual?!\n\nBtw congrats on your burgeoning relationship with Dylan, it sounds super nice\n\nI know you said she liked women, but she clearly never demonstrated any interest in you so I'd doubt it was that. But an extreme dislike of men is probably where the money is.\n\nWhy is she so hostile to men?? But more importantly, why would she end your friendship because you don't happen to share her ideas!", "Sounds like she broke up with you. Apparently you guys were in a relationship you weren\u2019t aware off. Also, NTA.", "NTA Sounds like you wouldn't be able to date anyone of the male variety and be friends with her; a best friend should let you live your life. She is justified to be upset since you did block her out in an emotional sense, but her reaction and other behavior implies she has some deeper issues that are not related to you.", "NTA - your business is not her business.

Block her right back and be happy that you met a nice guy to start a relationship with. You are under no obligation to report the details of your relationship to Victoria. She\u2019s no kind of real friend if her first response wasn\u2019t happiness and excitement for you.

Anyways she clearly is in the wrong because she didn't even let you explain on why you did that and called you names.", "...no, NTA here. Your best friend should just let you have the relationship you want. She's not the judge of who you want to date.", "NTA, you have valid reasons and you do not have the tell people even bf everything about your life immediately\u2026\nI suspect that Victoria may have feelings for you", "NTA you do not have to tell anyone your feelings for anyone else. She is a man hater, which is fine. But she is angry because you are not as well. \n\nThis woman seems pretty toxic. You might want to block her back and keep her blocked.", "Nta and she did you a solid you don\u2019t need people like that in your life", "NTA. A true friend would not act this way. It sounds like you talking about men with her would be like walking on eggshells, so it shouldn't surprise her that you didn't tell her. Maybe she's jealous. She sounds like a bad person though, maybe you two shouldn't be friends, though it's not my place to tell you what to do.", "NTA. Didn\u2019t even read the post, but your question is pretty clear and you never owe any of your friends an explanation of your love life.", "NTA and her blocking you is what's called a self correcting problem. You did absolutely nothing wrong and she should have been happy for you instead of acting like an impudent child.", "NTA. Transitioning a relationship from friends to more is complicated as it is. You're not sure if it's going to work out, you're probably not really solid in your own feelings, yet. It's natural to want to keep things to yourself while you figure things out, unless you have the kind of friendship where you can't *help* but tell her everything. \n\nFor her to react to something like that, period, is way over the top. It just makes it more so that you'd only been seeing Dylan for two weeks before telling her. \n\nShe's probably going to come back. The question is, do you want someone who is so (inside) ugly  in your life? It sounds like she's got some serious baggage, and that's a lot of negativity she's slinging around. It's got to affect you.", "Count your blessings and move on. Her issues aren\u2019t yours. Just because you two were best friends doesn\u2019t mean you tell her everything the minute a thought pops into your head. You were still trying to figure out whether you liked him and whether you wanted to have something with him. Why tell people when you aren\u2019t sure of your feelings for him? NTA", "She sounds weird, good riddance. NTA", "NTA, she had the hots for Dylan and wanted to hate fuck him. My best friend and I are are just entering our 30's and when he comes in and I know he has been cruising the Planet Fitness down the street I give him a high five and remind him to turn down the air to 74 when he does to sleep.\n\nNever in my life have I ever seen this type of interaction between any best friends. Usually bestfriends cock-assist you versus cock-block you. Good thing Dylan isn't a psychosexual or you would've been SOL.\n\nCount your blessings girl.", "NTA but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s into you. She sounds dramatic and controlling and you are probably better off. \n\nCongrats on things with Dylan! The best\n Relationships start this way", "So very clearly NTA. I had a friend like this. She was gay, I was not. I began dating my boyfriend and she ultimately made me choose, I chose my boyfriend and haven\u2019t spoken to her since. I can\u2019t tell you how much easier my life is now that I don\u2019t have her negativity around me. Let her block you, when she comes crawling back don\u2019t let her. She\u2019s waiting for the day that you want her, which will never come. And she\u2019ll always make you feel bad for it.", "Ugh NTA, friends like this are so gross. It sounds like she's saving you a lot of stress by removing herself from your life. Let her go. She'll probably come back around, and you can decide at that point if she's a worthy friend to have.", "She did let me explain myself, but I\u2019m pretty sure she just thought I was lying, and that I\u2019ve actually had feelings Dylan since I met him and have been keeping them a secret from her.  Anyways, I told her I gave her the news when I was ready to, but she says I should have told her immediately, regardless of whether I was ready to or not.", "Thank you! :)  He\u2019s a great guy.  I feel silly for not having given him the time of day when I met him.\n\nI have NO clue where her attitude towards men comes from.  She has great relationships with her father and her brother, and doesn\u2019t have any past traumatic experiences with men (that I know of).  I asked her about it once, and she said she didn\u2019t know what the reason is. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Came here to say this.", "I was thinking, too, that this would have happened no matter who I started dating, as long as he was male. Crazy. Thank you for your comment \ud83d\ude01", "She was definitely oddly possessive of her friends.  I\u2019m glad you think it\u2019s weird too.", "Even if that was the case, it doesn't matter. Your friend does not get to police who you date and you have no obligation to tell anyone anything about your romantic life. Honestly wondering what you like about her. She seems insufferable.", "Honestly if someone is so hot and cold with you over something as simple as a boyfriend, they probably weren't such a great friend to begin with.\n\nAnd I kinda like that you didnt like him straight away. The best relationships come out of nowhere ;) x", "It's cause she likes you lol. \n\nShe feels betrayed because she's upset your dating someone else. \n\nShe trashes men to you because she wants you to like them less. \n\nI'm sorry she's not handling it well. I'm also wlw and she's giving off insecure closeted lesbian in middle school with a crush on her best friend. We usually grow outta that phase hopefully she will too.", "She\u2019s hilarious and really fun to be around, but she\u2019s definitely got issues.  Thank you for your insight.  It was a little hard for me to tell in the moment whether or not I was being a bad friend, but these comments have eased my mind."]}
