I noticed sometimes people post things for free, specifically items for mom or baby... Then I noticed my friend on her \"fake\" account, claiming dibs on a few pricy items... I go digging and find she's been hoarding free stuff to resell on Mercari. I found countless posts where she begged and claimed things, and then found those items for sale/sold.\n\nThis annoyed me- deeply. This woman HATES children, and is not struggling whatsoever. Born wealthy and married wealthy. Always bragging. Never without. \n\nSo I simply said \"WTF you don't even have kids.\" In response to her claiming dibs on a NIB free B-pump in the comments. \n\nThis group is specifically for expecting and current parents- only. They make it very clear when joining. There are actual needy mothers who would be so happy for these gifts and donations. She has the luxury of being on her phone 24/7 and seemingly is good at commenting first. \n\nI also found activity on other \"buy nothing\" amd support groups. \n\nIt ended there. Legit, I'm cut out entirely. No argument, no words. I got on my other account and can't find anything from her, like she erased all public comments. Her interactions in the group are gone \n\nI understand some may say it was none of my business. That maybe she is needing money. Don't hate the hustle. I should want her to get what she wants. I can't agree with taking from needy families to fuel her daily Starbucks and Ulta trips. \n\nI know this account was her- she once used it to contact me while in fb jail and for drama. Plus she reacted herself, on her real account and banished me immediately.\n\nEdit- no, we're no longer friends. We only stayed friends so long because we had weird history. It was always awkward, and she quit coming around when she grew up and got a nasty personality.

As of immediately after I said something.", "That won't be seen as excessive or petty? Like, will they think I'm the bad guy starting drama and ban me? I completely thought about it, but tried to settle down and let it be hoping she's already ashamed enough to stop- but if it's on going, maybe it's necessary.  \n\nOf course I collected evidence, though don't like to admit it.", "This.\n\nHonestly I mean if it was only on posts that were like \u201ccome get it or I\u2019m taking it to goodwill today\u201d on the curb it would still be KINDA scummy but I\u2019d at least understand the hustle.\n\nThese are people waiting for someone to show interest in the items hoping they go to someone who needs them and her selling them is extra shitty", "Not at all.

Because I could definitely see someone with an unexpected pregnancy (or a close family member with one!) who has been vocal about not wanting kids trying to keep the situation as quiet as possible with people they only know vaguely. If I were pregnant and struggling about how or whether to keep the kid and panicing about how to afford it, I might also block OP. This is very much a reach, but I can't think of any other reason someone might want parts for a pump unless it's happening in such a quantity as to turn a significant profit.", "And let them know that she has no children / isn't expecting ,(and hates kids) so she shouldn't have been able to join in the first place."]}
