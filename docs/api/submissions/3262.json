I noticed sometimes people post things for free, specifically items for mom or baby... Then I noticed my friend on her \"fake\" account, claiming dibs on a few pricy items... I go digging and find she's been hoarding free stuff to resell on Mercari. I found countless posts where she begged and claimed things, and then found those items for sale/sold.\n\nThis annoyed me- deeply. This woman HATES children, and is not struggling whatsoever. Born wealthy and married wealthy. Always bragging. Never without. \n\nSo I simply said \"WTF you don't even have kids.\" In response to her claiming dibs on a NIB free B-pump in the comments. \n\nThis group is specifically for expecting and current parents- only. They make it very clear when joining. There are actual needy mothers who would be so happy for these gifts and donations. She has the luxury of being on her phone 24/7 and seemingly is good at commenting first. \n\nI also found activity on other \"buy nothing\" amd support groups. \n\nIt ended there. Legit, I'm cut out entirely. No argument, no words. I got on my other account and can't find anything from her, like she erased all public comments. Her interactions in the group are gone \n\nI understand some may say it was none of my business. That maybe she is needing money. Don't hate the hustle. I should want her to get what she wants. I can't agree with taking from needy families to fuel her daily Starbucks and Ulta trips. \n\nI know this account was her- she once used it to contact me while in fb jail and for drama. Plus she reacted herself, on her real account and banished me immediately.\n\nEdit- no, we're no longer friends. We only stayed friends so long because we had weird history. It was always awkward, and she quit coming around when she grew up and got a nasty personality.

As of immediately after I said something.", "That won't be seen as excessive or petty? Like, will they think I'm the bad guy starting drama and ban me? I completely thought about it, but tried to settle down and let it be hoping she's already ashamed enough to stop- but if it's on going, maybe it's necessary.  \n\nOf course I collected evidence, though don't like to admit it.", "This.\n\nHonestly I mean if it was only on posts that were like \u201ccome get it or I\u2019m taking it to goodwill today\u201d on the curb it would still be KINDA scummy but I\u2019d at least understand the hustle.\n\nThese are people waiting for someone to show interest in the items hoping they go to someone who needs them and her selling them is extra shitty", "Not at all. She\u2019s stealing free items from people in need to sell for profit.", "They need to be aware that she's taking free items and turning around and selling them. There's gotta be some kind of rule list for a group like this.", "Generally the only rules for free items are like- safe and clean items, no using donations for clout, no questioning or entitlement, NSA, first come first serve\n\nI completely wish there was a no-no list, of rules and people to be avoided, but new accounts and fake names make it pointless", "\"No using donations for clout\"\n\nRight there is exactly what she's doing, so she has absolutely gone against the rules\n\nNTA", "Maybe you could message the mods for those groups and ask: \"What's your policy on people claiming donations/offers to resell for profit? I've recently discovered someone doing just that for extra spending money. I don't want to overstep as there's no rules written about this but, it just feels wrong.\" or something like that?\n\nAlso, from everything you've said I don't know if she has the capacity to feel shame. She's stealing stuff from *babies* ffs. She is the Grinch of Mercari.", "**NTA**", "At the very least, they should be made aware that she isn\u2019t a mom or expecting. She lied to get into the group.", "Depending on the timeframe of these posts \u2014 are we sure she isn't? Because I could definitely see someone with an unexpected pregnancy (or a close family member with one!) who has been vocal about not wanting kids trying to keep the situation as quiet as possible with people they only know vaguely. If I were pregnant and struggling about how or whether to keep the kid and panicing about how to afford it, I might also block OP. This is very much a reach, but I can't think of any other reason someone might want parts for a pump unless it's happening in such a quantity as to turn a significant profit.", "And let them know that she has no children / isn't expecting ,(and hates kids) so she shouldn't have been able to join in the first place.", "NTA How is this different from rich people going to the soup kitchen or food handouts.\n\nThese are the final resource for struggling families. She who is wealthy is stealing from those barely surviving.", "NTA I\u2019d just screenshot the \u201cfor sale\u201d posts and the post in your group begging for the things and send them to the mods. \n\nEveryone who makes the connection between the accounts could do that. It doesn't have to mention your former \u201cfriend\u201d or their identity and get you in trouble with her. Just sending the proof will get her banned.", "NTA.

She shouldn't be doing what she's doing, but I would point out that things are not always what they seem.  While you think she's wealthy, perhaps her husband lost his job, or they're late on their mortgage payments.  These don't excuse what she's doing, but you are assuming that how it looks from the outside is what it is on the inside, and that's not necessarily true.  To all the people who are outraged by this post: I'm not defending her or what she's doing.  My only point is that sometimes all is not what it seems.", "You two weren\u2019t ever really friends to begin with, so no real losses here.", "NTa.", "NTA but report her. Many of these groups have a rule that you can\u2019t resell the items", "It's neither excessive nor petty to expose this kind of antisocial behavior. In fact, it's your moral duty to do so.", "Many groups have rules about selling items people get for free and a limit to how many groups like that people can belong to.  Do not feel guilty, those rules are in place for people like your friend.", "Message the mod for every group she's in. They will ban and block her. If it's not explicitly stated \"no reselling\" it's an unspoken rule. There is a lady that has been banned from every group in our area because of shit like that. Always on her phone, first to comment and taking all the baby stuff. She doesn't have kids. It pissed off all the parents."]}
