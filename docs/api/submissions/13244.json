Her\u2026 she can\u2019t be upset when she was warned and did it anyway\u2026", "Something something dull from previous use.", "NTA - I would be livid. You bought the house, you told her not to drill, she did it anyway. What else is she going to feel free to do to your house?", "they\u2019re not your cabinets. you should be telling her what to do in the home that is also hers. she shouldn\u2019t have done something without asking you but you shouldn\u2019t have lashed out. it sounds like she was just trying to make the home look nice. just because she wasn\u2019t sure about the masonry bits doesn\u2019t make her incompetent.", "NTA, but you may have to ask yourself why she did it. If you say no to her a lot or don't let her do anything DIY there could be some underlying frustration that led her to try... badly. She could be 100% asshole or 50% asshole depending. Ruining a cabinet wasn't the way to go about anything though.", "This is what triggers you? You clearly showed her the future. This is, what I call, \"First World Problem\". Full stop. She is right to be upset at your unreasonable reaction. YTA", "She did know about masonry bits he told her beforehand. She disrespected him and did what she wanted to do anyways and fucked it up. She is incompetent and way more.", "No, dont make her pay for the materials. Make her correct it herself - she can figure out how on her own.", "don\u2019t need anymore information to know you\u2019re a man. this whole situation was annoying and blown out of proportion. doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s an idiot. she\u2019s an idiot just as much as he is.", "Why do i get the impression ur a nitty", "Don\u2019t need any more information to know you\u2019re a woman. Your lack of accountability is showing. \n\nHave you ever bought cabinets? They are freaking expensive. And it\u2019s not as simple as just filling the hole or buying a new door. I didn\u2019t say she was an idiot. I said she was disrespectful and incompetent specifically. And who knows if he is an idiot or not, but at least he knows what drill bits to use.", "And assuming it was a solid colour and not a wood grain/veneer.", "NTA. replace the GF before anything else", "If he does not know how to do the repair, and doesn't have the materials, that's multiple hours of work to figure it out and get the materials - or the result will permanently look bad. Plenty of suggestions in this thread are both temporary/brittle, and don't fully hide the damage.\n\nIf he does know how to do the repair and has the material... then he would have wood drill bits, so no he has no idea.\n\nJust in case: face plate to cover the damage from the wandering drill bit at the front, forstner bit to drill out the tear out on the back to half the depth of the door, then plug that round hole with a round wooden plug (press fit & glue). Then re- drill the hole through the plug with a wood drill bit.", "Than alimony in another decade", "They\u2019re not her cabinets."]}
