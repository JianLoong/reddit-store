You don\u2019t use masonry bits to drill wood, which you told her, and yet she did it anyway. Plus she didn\u2019t ask you whether or not you wanted pulls, or even what kind?

I work in a hardware store. I have seen the damage using the wrong tool/bit/etc does in the hands of the simple DIYer that doesn't do their research or the bare minimum. She\n\n* didn't know what she was doing. Like did she even take the cabinet door off? Tape off the area she was drilling? Check to see what size bit she should use? Did she use an impact drill (which if you have masonry bits I assume you have and why the hole is big) instead of a regular drill?\n* **didn't ask you.** That above all is the kicker. She didn't ask. Your cabinets didn't have knobs? Are they J-pull? True handleless? Push to open?\n\nOverall, I hope that if you allowed her to continue her poorly thought out DIY attempt that she at least looked up how to make sure all the knobs stay even during the process so that they don't look half-assed. And if she isn't continuing, that you are able to fix that hole with bondo and have the ability to fix the finish. You don't mention if the cabinets have that glass finish, are wood grain, etc.", "I\u2019ll probably be downvoted, but ESH.\n\nShe should\u2019ve googled if a masonry bit would work. She should\u2019ve stopped when it was clear it wasn\u2019t working. \n\nIs it really a \u201cbig ass hole\u201d? Unless she was using a bit that was WAY to big for a knob, which would be weird in the first place, there wouldn\u2019t be a big hole. Even if the masonry bit went wild, it wouldn\u2019t leave a giant hole. I get being upset since they are brand new cabinets, but they aren\u2019t ruined. I get the feeling you are catastrophizing. Odds are the knob will cover whatever happened. If it doesn\u2019t, putty it and use the matching crayon thing. I totally get why she was annoyed that you yelled at her.", "genuine question, you mentioned \u201cmy cabinets\u201d and \u201cmy house\u201d yet she lives there correct? pays bills to live there as well? so wouldn\u2019t it be our house whether you initially bought it yourself, you stated you bought it so BOTH of you had more space.", "NTA.

I'm assuming, since these were previously used bits, they jumped around a little bit, so the front hole probably has a shit load of scratches around it, and the back hole probably has a lot of tear out since Miss Carpentry Genius probably didn't know to use a backer board. Also, as somewhat of a woodworker myself, it is usually a good idea to use a template or some sort of a jig, to create symmetrical placement of the knobs on each cabinet door. I'm guessing the gf didn't implement anything like that either.\n\nThis is OP's house, even if it is the gf's home. That means OP retains veto power for discussions about alterations.\n\nOP, you probably need to lay down your expectations and boundaries for how you want things to go for future projects.", "He could also replace gf, just saying \ud83d\ude05", "I just had to buy new cabinets for my home because of water damage.
