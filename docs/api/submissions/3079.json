I am very close with them and they treat me like their actual daughter. About 3 years ago his brother was dating a girl who said she has leukemia. Over the few months of getting to know her she shared various details about her illness and treatments. My in laws started to feel uncomfortable when she shared her parents were moving to a different state and she was staying for college alone. She was 23 years old and being treated for cancer and they were apparently fine leaving her. She shared that she was undergoing radiation, arsenic, chemo, and a trial therapy to cure her leukemia. Meanwhile she looks like an extremely normal healthy girl aside from the benign tumor lumps on her shoulder that she had since we knew her. When she told my brother in law about her cancer she shared he was not allowed to mention it around her family because they were extremely private people. She also shared that she was pregnant and had to abort the miracle baby because it was no longer developing. The reason my in laws got suspicious is because her diet consisted of many diet cokes a day, chocolate milk, and fast food. She shared with them the abortion story but her story was different than the one she told me, saying it was her life or the babies because of the cancer. We also are all on life 360 and when she was supposed to be at the doctors for treatment she was at the mall. She claimed it\u2019s bc her phone was off and it just shared her last location. When they told their son to be careful it all blew up and he sided with her. She claimed she spent an entire day running around getting medical records to prove it but when it came down to showing it she shared an article about chemo brain explaining why her stories didn\u2019t add up and then got in a blow out screaming match that led to them saying they don\u2019t owe his parents any proof and she\u2019s extremely private. Very soon after the fight she was clear of the cancer and doing much better. To this day we have no relationship and they still say we are the Aholes for questioning someone\u2019s cancer. He even goes as far as telling people his parents were emotionally abusive towards him. They got married and expect everyone to let it all go and \u201cleave the past in the past\u201d as if they are angels that are willing to forgive us?

Chemo and radiation are brutal. The adjacent meds are brutal.", "NTA.  There were enough inconsistencies that did not add up that multiple people came to the same conclusion that this was fake.  As for moving forward you do not need to remain isolated from them forever as they are family, but never take anything she says at face value without some verification.  Trying some limited contact should be fine, but if the pattern begins to repeat itself then go back to no contact and make sure your Brother-in-Law knows why.  This sounds like your new Sister-in-Law likes to use emotional blackmail and pity to get their way and this is how they go about setting the stage for it.", "NTA and big yikes for sure but she might actually have Munchausen Syndrome. Hard to tell from one example but if it becomes a pattern then it\u2019s something for your BIL to look into.", "NTA  \n  \nPost on their facebook a congratulations on overcoming leukemia etc so her family sees it.", "NTA no one is owed your time and if they keep pushing it with the slander, i'd be tempted to contact her family for the truth, if you're truly suspicious of everything. I would be.", "Cancer took my father at 77 years young. On his birthday, how ironic. My daughter beat cancers ass and is now cancer-free. I hate when people fake it for sympathy and or money. But I'm also saddened by what is lacking in their life that they feel they need to do this.", "Eeew yuck I hate these types of posts. I have to go ESH for a couple reasons. On your and the in-laws part you all should understand that nobody's private medical history or diagnosis is actually your business. I 100% understand why you guys were questioning it however, what was there to gain by questioning it? If she's not asking you guys for money and seems to be just attention seeking and you guys don't want to play then don't. You simply don't have to ask her questions about her \" treatment \", progress, or really anything related to her health and you guys could have just changed the subject anytime she brought it up. You guys accomplished absolutely nothing by trying to force some Grand reveal of her lying about her medical condition. Additionally I would say to you that judging her diet choices during a potential cancer diagnosis is absolutely a shit thing to do because when my nephew had cancer I can 100% tell you that he ate any and everything he wanted whether it was good or bad because sometimes that's all you can stomach.\n\nOn the other hand, sister-in-law sounds manipulative and yes possibly like a liar and seemed to happily play into the controversy you guys cause between yourselves and she and her now husband. You guys probably gave her exactly what she wanted by forcing the subject. Let's say that Her diagnosis was legitimate, were she so private about this then she stoked the fires by feeding you all information that she wasn't willing to expound on. Again she's not obligated to do so but her behavior of saying \"hey I have XYZ but don't ask me any questions and don't make any comments about it in front of my family. \" was definitely more pots stiring bullshit. Where you go from here is completely up to you guys individually. If she's not somebody you see herself being friends with outside of your husband's family then there's no pressure to be her buddy. But you all could have behaved better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

She invented some crazy story to make her parents hate my ILs and they blocked their phone number! I\u2019m more confused why my brother in law doesn\u2019t see the crazy red flags! It got spun to we don\u2019t believe she\u2019s ever been sick..idk what that means but all I\u2019m saying is I know she was not going through all those hard core therapies when we met her!!", "We never questioned her. They went to their son and said be careful because some of this isn\u2019t adding up and he chose to go to her and ask her to prove it to them and then retract that she needed to do this. They always stood by it\u2019s not for us to know it\u2019s for him to watch out for. It blew up because they were mad when they demanded an apology for not knowing what to believe and when I said I thought she was being manipulative and shady.", "You'd be surprised what people are willing to look past/ignore to get laid...", "I would just take a huge step away from this situation. There\u2019s no way you can win. And I realize that\u2019s not the goal. It\u2019s just whatever you do will be wrong in their eyes. \nJust let it blow up.

She is shady.", "NTA", "As someone who actually lived through much of what she claimed she was going through, I call BS.  \n\nShe is just one of those people who claim to be ill for attention and possibly a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nDo NOT let it go.  These people are a scourge on society who do nothing but make it more difficult for those that are truly going through these types of illnesses.\n\nYour BIL must be less than stellar intellectually to have bought all that.\n\nNTA", "Hmm maybe she confused lipoma with lymphoma? If it\u2019s leukemia, should be very obvious, even on regular wbc, single the wbc morphology would be wonky. And yeah.

I have a co-worker that an  compulsive liar I mean this lady she laughs over everything.\n\nShe lied and said she had cancer she lied and said she had internal bleeding she lied and said that her daughter broke her tailbone she lied and said her son broke his foot she lied and said she broke her eye socket she lied and said she broke her nose she lied and said she broke her arm.\n\nThe value I work with this lady and I've known her for years and she was a compulsive liar then but we see you everyday and all these ailments that you claim are going on like the broken nose most people know broken though if you get the raccoon ass she didn't have that.  The daughter's broken tailbone that same day I seen her outside running with other children and this was after she said the daughter was home and so much pain because she broke her tailbone..

If it had been her asking for money or something I could see the scrutiny, but as you told it, you all blew up the relationship with BIL in order to try to catch her in lies and clearly that did NOT go as planned.\n\nSo in the end why are you so committed to the old narrative?\n\nFor all you know it was true, or it could been all lies. Either way I assume the intent was to protect BIL and that's opposite of what has happened. You may want to play nice, if you really think she's capable of that he'll need a reliable off ramp when it blows up for real.", "Wow!! NTA at all. Steer clear of this nut bag. Sorry your brother is stuck with her and siding with her but save yourselves and don\u2019t let her in.
