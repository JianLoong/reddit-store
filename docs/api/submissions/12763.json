If Riya felt you were so wrong, she should have tried calling your parents to see what they had to say  - no doubt they would have said no as well. You had good reasons, including having doubts about the host who you know personally.", "NTA. You're doing what any concerned and loving guardian would do. I applaud you for caring enough and unfortunately you are right. If she were a grown woman - go ahead and do your thing sweetie. But at that age....you're preventing the worst case scenario from happening. Also, would your parents have allowed her to go knowing everything you know?!", "NTA for not letting her go to the party, that seems like a smart decision, but you shouldn\u2019t have shamed her clothing choice. You could have left that completely out of it. Girls have a hard enough time with being victim blamed and now if, god forbid, something would ever happen to her, she will have her brothers voice in her head that it might be her fault for what she was wearing.", "NTA. Your parents left you in charge for a reason. Sounds like you are protecting your sister from a potentially bad situation. And I agree that she is too young to go to parties like that with seniors.", "NTA but you didn\u2019t have to go into the whole outfit angle, it was unnecessary. It doesn\u2019t make you wrong but it probably made her feel shitty, which was unnecessary. For future reference you don\u2019t need to give a million reasons, you can just say no. You are in charge, responsible, and you don\u2019t think your parents would be ok with her going.", "NTA. An 18 year old asking a 14 year old to come round to his for a party? That's disturbing and should be reported to your school", "NTA but be kinder to your sister, you executed a good deed in a shitty way, lowkey shaming her outfit and for wanting to go to a party like how other kids do. You should communicate your feelings better instead of showing attitude when she's already upset. Your parents wouldn't have allowed her anyways so you're enforcing that, but it's a bummer to not be allowed out and you could have soften the blow a bit.", "NTA- Good job protecting your younger sibling. She needs to understand that there are predators out in this world and human trafficking is real.", "NTA. While the commentary about her outfit was unnecessary. Seeing as we all know, this \"creepy\" guy wouldn't care how she was dressed. The main concern is trying to prevent your sister from being in a vulnerable situation. You hit the nail on the head there. She was obviously trying to get away with something your parents would have put a stop to if they were present. \n\nGood job, op. Just tell your little sister to take her complaints up with your parents.", "NTA - couldn't she have called your parents to override your decision?\n\nThe child is your responsibility.", "Nta. \n\nIf you\u2019re under 18 you don\u2019t need to dress like you\u2019re going to a club (or thong bikinis but that\u2019s another conversation). Idgaf but you don\u2019t need to be showing your body off that way as a child. \n\nNot only that but a 14 year old has no business hanging out with an 18 year old or going to parties. I know, I\u2019m a buzz kill. But you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nSometimes being the responsible adult means protecting vulnerable people in your care from harm they dont fully comprehend or see and appearing like the arsehole.\n\nYou did good.", "NTA. She doesn't have the mature brain to think the way you do...next time, just call your parents & have them \"forbid her\" \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Sorry but if she wants to play games & make you the a-hole, show her what an real a-hole you can be \ud83e\udd2d", "NTA, your friend coming over isn\u2019t anything like your little sister going to that party esp. since your parents wouldn\u2019t allow her to go in the first place.", "You don't give up I'll give you that.

Shaming her outfits at an age when she's learning to express herself, won't get you very far and just make her hate you.

The guy is a known creep, and it's definitely shady that he invited a minor to a party with what I would assume to be a bunch of other 18-year-olds.

I am old school in that I believe the answer is \"yes\" (especially YOUNG girls).\n\nBut, there are a lot of people who would call this \"victim blaming\", which I agree to somewhat. (dressing sexualized clearly does not justify sexual violence for example)  At the same time, you can't have your boobs hanging out and then get mad that someone is looking at them.

(not saying there's anything emotionally or socially wrong with her) It's just that she's a kid so she's a bit na\u00efve and easier to take advantage of than people with more life experience. It's ingrained in our society so I don't blame you for thinking the way you do at all. But it would be good to learn for the future that statements like these also can greatly affect the public's view of victim's but also the victim's view of themselves. They can feel a lot of guilt and self-hatred for thinking they were part of the problem. It also think that makes our society less safe because people are more likely to stay silent and less likely to report the actual criminal. \n\nWith that being said, I'm glad you were able to protect your sister and you sound like a good brother with good intentions. Keep up the good work.", "Thanks for being a good brother my dude.", "They are all made with throwaway accounts.", "It's a PARTY, not a date.
