For some context, I found 5 kittens last year that were all on the brink of death that required extensive medical care which I footed the bill for. We quickly fell in love with the kittens and decided to keep all of them. I still live with my mother and we decided to split up the cats between family members.\nOne of the cats I named Khoshekh from the podcast Welcome to Nightvale. I named him as soon as I found him as I did with the other cats. After taking care of them for a while, We decided Khoshekh would go to Jill along with one of the other cats, Penny. While Jill loved the kittens when they were small, she didnt do much to clean up after their boxes and would complain when she had to take them to the vet because me or my mother were working. I paid for everything including food, litter and the vet visits.\n\nJill, who is in college, was on summer break when we found them. Before she left to return to college, she decided to rename Khoshekh to Oliver. I didn\u2019t like the idea of changing his name because he had already learned to respond to the name Khoshekh and even would come running when you called. I wanted to be nice at first and just agree to call him Oliver however, I was appalled to find that when Jill came home from break, she didn\u2019t care for the cats at all nor would she pay attention to them or even let them in her room. Not to mention, Khoshekh still had surgeries he needed to undergo besides his neuter that I was paying for and taking him to. Even still, she was very adamant on renaming Khoshekh to Oliver. Jill still did not do any work to maintain the cats and I was still paying for vet appointments, food and litter while caring for all of them.\n \nIt came to a point where I told Jill that if she wants this cat to be hers that she needs to step up and start taking care of them, pay attention to them and pay me back for all the vet bills i've spent. After totalling all the vet bills and medications that I\u2019ve paid for, I totaled up close to $800. Since my sister is in college i decided to go easy on her and only ask her to pay me back $400. Until I was payed back and she proved that she could take care of them, I told her that I will be calling him by the name I gave him and that he responds to. \n\nFastforward to today, almost a complete year since we found the cats, Jill found an old tag on his carrier from when I was taking him to the vets office that was labeled Khoshekh [lastname] and she left me a very aggressive note and we got into a heated argument because his name on his vet records is Khoshekh. Jill has still not paid me back for any of his expenses or put any effort into taking care of them. I told Jill that I will not call him Oliver until I\u2019ve been paid and until she steps up to take care of him\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: additional context I forgot to include - since I took him to the vet appointments and payed for everything, the name on his records is Khoshekh and on records I am his owner", "created_utc": 1686750898, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1498iva/aita_for_deadnaming_my_cat/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
