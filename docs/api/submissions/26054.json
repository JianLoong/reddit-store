Whilst many people have a tendency to weight shame, some might genuinely be concerned and make comments without realising the effect it might have. So by you educating her and giving her a solid reason for why you were upset, you may have helped her avoid making comments like that in the future. Not just to you but to others.", "NTA. My gosh your friends sound awful. You are obviously aware of your weight, she had no right to comment on it.

Usually, and I mean almost all the times, an overweight person knows they are overweight. Nobody needs to chime in to remind them. They realize it almost every minute of each day (my experience from being tiny to struggling with my weight now). NTA. Your friend, regardless of her intentions, should worry about being a good friend, not your weight.", "NTA you should definitely try to stay healthy, and it sounds like you are trying to do so! Always stand up for yourself! Don\u2019t listen to all of these obese and unhealthy people in the comments who want you to be like them though. You deserve to be happy and healthy.", "NTA\n\nBut friends should be able to say things like this.  How did she say it? Was it snarky?

For many folks that I know it\u2019s either food insecurity or crack addiction. \n\nIt\u2019s best not to comment unless the person brings it up on their own.", "Because you never know how someone will take it and it's best just to not even go there."]}
