Flat out ask your Grandma why she doesn\u2019t like you. See what her response is, but make sure you\u2019re prepared for the response.", "NTA, including your dad. She is playing favorites, which is unacceptable since every son/daughter deserves equal treatment, and not giving one of them more love.", "NTA. though I sort of agree that you should ask her outright why she doesn't like you, maybe pose the question differently. I was thinking you should ask her why she expects to be treated with warmth and kindness when she doesn't do the same to you. Try to get her to understand your perspective, and point out that her tactics are obvious and unkind. Then maybe ask why she thinks she deserves kindness and consideration, when she can't reciprocate. She is after all the adult in the situation, and maybe should set the prescedent toward maturity.\n\n\n Regardless what you do or do not say, stay true to your feelings and do not cave to your family's pressure to be nice to her simply because she exists. That's garbage, and peer pressure at it's worst. Your cousins are just as bad as grandma if they expect you to be inviting even though you're treated poorly.", "Your older cousins show be giving that talk to your grandma.

Ignore her forever. \n\ni like drama so i'm gonna add my crazy conspiracy theories: \n\nhave you considered that your dad is the product of an affair? i've been watching a lot of soap operas and one of the plots was a wedlock baby outside of the marriage who is loathed forever. \n\none case, she had the affair and hated the guilt she felt looking at the baby\nsecond case, grampa got someone preggo and they took in the affair baby\n\nI'm sure neither of those cases are true, but even if they were, it wouldn't give her right to be a dick.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He always told me she would get my aunt and uncles new things and he would only get hand me downs, and she used to nitpick everything and start shit with him. She was only nice when asking him for money which he sent but he found out she used it all to gamble so he barely speaks to her. She was supposed to stay at my aunts house for her visit but my cousin is going to have a child soon so the previous empty room is where him and his girlfriend are staying at while they get their new house. Since only me and my dad are currently in the house we have extra rooms and my dad decided to be nice and let her stay", "I have so many wild theories from various tv plot lines. Lol Does your Dad stand up for himself and the other family members blindly follow her?", "hard to say because our whole family is kinda broken up but my dad is the only one who openly dislikes her. My aunt doesn\u2019t like her either but still has a decent relationship with her. my cousins (aunts kids) don\u2019t have an issue with her. So i guess that can be the case. My dad stopped sending her money ever since he found out she wasted it all on gambling, my aunt still sends her some money so that might be another reason"]}
