You could have stopped and then told the people that one thing about the gym is that periodically some jerk will make you stop exercising because he wants to tell people about the gym.", "I have always been fond of solitary exercise.  I do what I need to do to stay healthy, and it's important to me to be able to do so in peace because losing focus makes it difficult to maintain good habits.  I do whatever I can to decrease the probability of being interrupted by others in the tiny workout room in my building.\n\nThis guy should have planned better.  It's not your problem to solve that he didn't.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I have bad joints. An elliptical is the only cardio I can do that doesn't involve water.", "NTA\n\nIt's your right to use the gym and it doesn't seem like you were rude to him. If the induction was so important why wouldn't they rent out the gym for 20 minutes or notify people. NTA", "\n\nNTA - You were completely within your right to take the machine you had chosen and finish your workout without interruption. Any kind of induction session should have been pre-scheduled and the necessary notifications sent out ahead of time, not thrust upon people already using the gym. You were polite and professional, and should feel proud of yourself for standing up for your own rights.", "NTA. You were totally right.", "Well, it all depends on how nicely this person asked. You make him sound entitled and demanding, so obviously in this situation NTA... F him.\n\nIf he was polite, you were rude and you could have modified your workout without major implications, then mild YTA.", "Yeah, that was exactly it.

Are these people tenants in your building? does he work for the building? I wonder if management even know about this. I would suggest to them to set a time, like once a month or so, where the gym is closed for 20 minutes for induction sessions.", "How to watch YouTube haha tbh that's an extremely strange thing to do at gym idc who doesn't agree", "If it's what I think it is they do it at my gym all the time to people who want to sign up and there's extremely loud music and about 50 people working out at the same time haha that guy would have a mental breakdown", "I love how casually you adopted using \u201cgym induction\u201d.  I would have inducted a lot of grotesque gym grunts into his tour.", ">Are these people tenants in your building?\n\nThis is what's puzzling me too.\n\nI wonder if he's a resident and personal trainer and wanted to take advantage of the building gym for his gig, or if the building management made an agreement with him to make some money to help with maintenance.", "I\u2019m always amazed at the people who can watch TV on the tread, elliptical, or bike. I have no issue with screens on cars, buses, trains, and planes but trying to watch something when I\u2019m doing cardio makes me incredibly dizzy!", "Yeah. Like who would think that in a (semi) public area, like\u2026the public would be there lol", "They do these things at my gym all the time. It's insane that the person doing it would interrupt a current member's workout because of noise coming from a gym machine... like... at the gym.", "It's outlandish. Anyone watching YouTube on one of those machines isn't working out and is taking up space doing nonsense there", "Those ads for the treadmill desk always amaze me. There is no way I would be able to work & walk at the same time.", "I watch TV on my treadmill while bookin it all the time, how is that not working out? Why are audio books and music OK but not something with a screen?", "I watch TV on my stationary bike all the time. Not at the gym, in my home but I find it\u2019s a great way to keep up with my shows & get some exercise in.", "NAH He asked, you said no. No asshole behavior here, end of story.", "NTA", "Niether of you are an A-Holes. He asked which nothing wrong with asking, you said no and he got back to it.", "NTA", "\u201cIts difficult to talk with the thonk thonk of your machine\u201d\nYeah its also difficult working out with you breathing around here.", "What the hell is a \"gym induction?\"  I have never heard of that terminology in my life.  Do you mean like a gym tour or something?", "Nta\n\nYou were using a piece of equipment that you pay for the right to use, and like you stated, if they were doing a tour, they could have put a notice that between x and y time that the gym was closed", "NTA whatsoever and I admire your calm, perfectly legitimate response!", "Yeah seems a bit AH each way.\nWould it have messed up your day that much to help by doing something quieter for a while?", "EXACTLY", "It's your right to use the gym and it doesn't seem like you were rude to him.", "I love this!

Stop gatekeeping working out.", "It\u2019s easy if you just commit to doing both shittily!", "NAH. You said no and he continued about his day. Didn't even accuse you of being the AH.

If not, does the management company have a limit on the number of guests someone can bring into the gym? And if someone can use it for their business?", "NTA and good or bad knees it's the managements job to notify you in advance.  I live in a place with a community gym and they let us know when classes might be there so you can plan around it.  The classes are a trainer showing groups of people how to use equipment, not typical fitness classes.", "Absolutely NTA. You weren't groaning loudly lifting weights but using a machine as intended that makes noise.", "NTA", "nta", "NTA whatsoever and I admire your calm, perfectly legitimate response!", "Its really common, it's like a safety briefing and introduction to the various machines at the gym. I've never joined a gym that hasn't done one.", "Induction is another word for introduction. One of the definitions is \"an initial experience\".  I had to look it up myself.", "This guy should have planned better. It's not your problem to solve that he didn't.\n\nNTA", "Why is it puzzling?  Plenty of places with gyms in the development require you to do an induction before giving you access. It\u2019s normally  scheduled with someone from the company that they rent the equipment from.", "If I don\u2019t occupy my brain, I get bored. 15-20 minutes and I want to do something else. If I watch a video, I do 40 minutes on my bike happily.", "I can't use a treadmill WITHOUT a screen! It's just so boring.", "Its because a lot of people don't actually do that much \"work\"", "What's the difference between watching TV and Youtube...?  Every gym in the universe has a row of TVs in front of the cardio equipment, Youtube is just the same concept for a modern audience.", "> \"I could really do with you moving ...\"\n\nThis is the most passive aggressive sentence I've read this week.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIF he wants a gym for him alone, he has to rent one. NOT YOUR drama.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou handled that situation well.", "NTA.  He should have planned better.", "NTA. He should\u2019ve expected people to be working out. It\u2019s a gym.

Unless the gym was specifically reserved for this group, he shouldn\u2019t be surprised when people use the gym and make normal gym noises.", "HEY.  I'm on the elliptical right now and your induction is distracting.  Could you leave so I can exercise in peace?  Your talking is bothering me.", "Info - is there any particular reason you can't use a treadmill? Also, how many people live in this building? \n\nIn short, I'm curious why you would insist on this, when you have to be neighbours with these people?", "> What exactly is a gym induction?\n\nIt's when a gym is heated using electricity and magnets.", "She doesnt have to move and I dont think he's wrong to ask, this to me seems like a way to address the \"issue\". They just had an adult conversation and that was that.", "How long is a while? Also not even a slight ah move to keep doing what you\u2019re doing", "Talk about the equipment, basic health and safety, try and sell you personal training sessions. \n\nAt least in my experience. \n\nUsed a lot in the UK.", "Thank you!\n\nAnd here I was wondering whether it was an orientation.  \n\n\"Magnets - how do they work?\"", "Asking you to stop your work out? It's ok to ask. But, it's ok that you said no, as well.", "I'd say its puzzling because that seems like a whole lot of people if the only way to get access to the gym is by that approval, and if it was something like that I'd also expect OP to be more familiar with that as a process.", "The puzzling part is \"who in that group is a tenant?\", since from what I understood, the gym exists for the benefit of residents and is not open to gen pop.", "NTA. It\u2019s a (moderately) public space, unless if someone is purposefully being obnoxious, it is not within your right to ask them to stop what they\u2019re doing for your own benefit.", "NTA, gyms aren't quiet places wtf?", "Nta, fuck that guy.", "Have a chat with the management office to find out who hr is and if he had booked the room. \n\nNext time, state that you are s tenant and ask if he or if his group members are. Ask who in the management office he spoke to and whether he has a written contract.", "Also, smelly!", "And that's saying something on AITA LOL", "NTA and the sound of an elliptical is far less loud and disruptive compared to a treadmill. You would think as someone who is conducting a gym induction, he would know that!", "I once rented a place with a gym. My electronic key card would not open the gym until I did something like this induction. I assume it was for liability reasons.", "So you can't walk?", "Not fast enough to get my heart rate up.", "NTA. Dude was a presumptuous dick."]}
