{"id": 30920, "submission_id": "17ulr9o", "title": "AITA for calling out my dog sitter for doubling her charge 4 days before our flight?", "selftext": "My husband (33M) and I (35F) have 2 small dogs Pip (5M)and Skip (17M). We both work and live below our means and this allowed us to purchase a home and have some savings. We enjoy travel with the strategic use of use of miles, promos, & reciprocal travel friendships. I budget carefully and pre-plan everything so we have enough to live, enough to save, and enough to enjoy our lives.\n \nAside from our regular jobs, we also watch dogs on the side. We usually do so below market rate because we understand how inflated dog sitting fees have become. We usually pet sit for about $30/dog/day. Sometimes we even dog-sit for free if they are a friend or family members or if it is financially tight for some of our regular clients. We love animals and we are very understanding of other people\u2019s means. This has built us a small network of people we could rely on to watch our pets until recently.\n \nA couple of our friends moved away and some have become too busy. We started using a friend of my SIL named Betty. She had been charging us $30/day for Pip and $35/day for Skip. She stays at our house and sat for us with no issue at that rate 2 times prior.\n \nIn Sept, I informed her we were taking a longer trip to visit my husband\u2019s aunt for Thanksgiving as she has cancer. We told her it would just be Skip. After doing the math, it made sense to pay the fees & fly with Pip. She agreed.\n \nA few weeks before our trip, the sitter says she cannot watch Skip on Thanksgiving and Black Friday because her mom booked a cabin for them that didn\u2019t allow pets. So we scrambled to find someone to take Skip for those days. Although he does not have major medical issues and takes no meds; he is deaf, blind, has doggy dementia, and is incontinent. The incontinent part is usually puts people off taking him so we were very anxious. But after some time, we found a sitter willing to take him those days and Betty agreed to pick him up for the remainder of the days.\n \nThen 4 days before we leave for our trip, Betty says she will keep her rate at $65/day because she will be traveling from the cabin then picking up Skip. I called her out on this because we only needed to get an additional sitter because of the change in HER plans. For reference the other dog sitter was going to charge us $50/day. I would have booked her for the whole thing but Betty said she would charge us just an additional day for the pickup. My husband and I both assumed it would still be at our regular rate because she had not informed us otherwise over the 3 months we had planned this.\n \nI told her it was not cool that she is doubling our rate right before we are about to fly. I didn\u2019t tell her I wasn\u2019t going to pay the extra rate. I asked for a compromise and for her to be more upfront of any extra charges in the future. Betty then grew very \u201cuncomfortable with our interaction\u201d and basically backed out of watching him entirely. Thankfully the 2nd sitter was free to watch him the days she bailed on.\n \nAITA?\n\nAlso: While I appreciate your concerns about Skip\u2019s impending demise, he is actually still doing ok. He has no tumors, no cancer, etc. Sometimes we take him on small walks where he drools at all the scents. He has a very healthy appetite and loves his favorite foods. He likes to snuggle when we watch TV and always love to be in his special spot in the middle of the bed at night. Most of the time he is asleep. And when he wakes, we carry him gently to the backyard to relieve himself. We have talked at length with our vet about when it\u2019s time for him to go and they said while he\u2019s still enjoying his favorite things, no need to preemptively euthenize.", "created_utc": 1699911630, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ulr9o/aita_for_calling_out_my_dog_sitter_for_doubling/", "score": 2595, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
