We both work and live below our means and this allowed us to purchase a home and have some savings. We enjoy travel with the strategic use of use of miles, promos, & reciprocal travel friendships. I budget carefully and pre-plan everything so we have enough to live, enough to save, and enough to enjoy our lives.\n \nAside from our regular jobs, we also watch dogs on the side. We usually do so below market rate because we understand how inflated dog sitting fees have become. We usually pet sit for about $30/dog/day. Sometimes we even dog-sit for free if they are a friend or family members or if it is financially tight for some of our regular clients. We love animals and we are very understanding of other people\u2019s means. This has built us a small network of people we could rely on to watch our pets until recently.\n \nA couple of our friends moved away and some have become too busy. We started using a friend of my SIL named Betty. She had been charging us $30/day for Pip and $35/day for Skip. She stays at our house and sat for us with no issue at that rate 2 times prior.\n \nIn Sept, I informed her we were taking a longer trip to visit my husband\u2019s aunt for Thanksgiving as she has cancer. We told her it would just be Skip. After doing the math, it made sense to pay the fees & fly with Pip. She agreed.\n \nA few weeks before our trip, the sitter says she cannot watch Skip on Thanksgiving and Black Friday because her mom booked a cabin for them that didn\u2019t allow pets. So we scrambled to find someone to take Skip for those days. Although he does not have major medical issues and takes no meds; he is deaf, blind, has doggy dementia, and is incontinent. The incontinent part is usually puts people off taking him so we were very anxious. But after some time, we found a sitter willing to take him those days and Betty agreed to pick him up for the remainder of the days.\n \nThen 4 days before we leave for our trip, Betty says she will keep her rate at $65/day because she will be traveling from the cabin then picking up Skip. I called her out on this because we only needed to get an additional sitter because of the change in HER plans. For reference the other dog sitter was going to charge us $50/day. I would have booked her for the whole thing but Betty said she would charge us just an additional day for the pickup. My husband and I both assumed it would still be at our regular rate because she had not informed us otherwise over the 3 months we had planned this.\n \nI told her it was not cool that she is doubling our rate right before we are about to fly. I didn\u2019t tell her I wasn\u2019t going to pay. I asked for a compromise and for her to be more upfront of any extra charges in the future. Betty then grew very \u201cuncomfortable with our interaction\u201d and basically backed out of watching him entirely. Thankfully the 2nd sitter was free to watch him the days she bailed on.\n \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699911630, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ulr9o/aita_for_calling_out_my_dog_sitter_for_doubling/", "score": 506, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not like these are new/ a surprise for Betty. She was fine with that rate for previous visits, and she didn't raise an issue about the fee when you initially asked her.\n\nAll that changed is Betty's Thanksgiving plans. I think she upped her price because she wants extra money to go shopping next Friday. Whatever her reasons, the flip in schedule AND the price hike are just not reasonable or fair.\n\nThe good thing is you found a new dog sitter.

Raising the rate a few days before your trip was not cool.", "i'm saying nta. i don't know how all of these people are saying to put down a 17 year old dog because he's blind, deaf, incontinent, and has doggy dementia. we don't live with this dog, we don't know what his good days are vs his bad days. you don't euthanize dogs solely because of these reasons. there is a quality of life scale. how do ya'll not know that skip is happy go lucky and eats his food happily?", "What\u2019s with the whole backstory? If this is even real, YTA. \n\nI feel like the core of this is a misunderstanding. She was paid $65 a day to dogsit. I understand it was split between two dogs but that doesn\u2019t mean that one dog only is worth about half the price.

That\u2019s a massive burden and a ton of work and I think you should be happy to throw any money at it you need to.", "I think NTA because she committed to watch him and did not tell you that her fee has almost doubled.

It sounds like Betty tried to take advantage of you needing a dog sitter. She had initially agreed to do it, backed out, forced you to find a different (more expensive) sitter, and then tried to upcharge you on top of that. Definitely NTA, and a very reasonable request to be more upfront about those things.", "I had a chick do this to me once the week before an international trip when she knew I had no option - I said fine and just never called her again, and then gave a poor review online.", "NTA\n\nThere was plenty of time to discuss changes. The last minute price hike, especially for a relatively small amount (given it's not a long or frequent occurrence) it's kind of inconsiderate of her.

One reason I think the higher rate is a reasonable ask is because it\u2019s a holiday. Also, maybe after watching Skip before she felt that $35/day was too low given his medical issues and level of attention needed. If you don\u2019t like what she chooses to charge, then say no. I don\u2019t think there was anything to necessarily \u201ccall her out\u201d on. Sounded like she was pretty upfront from what you gave. $65 is fair for the holidays, your dogs medical issues, and if it\u2019s someone you know you trust and are comfortable with.", "That's what she wanted.

The pet sitter has to take the same amount of time out of their day to come to your house and care for pet(s) whether it's 1 or 2 pet(s). And it's over a holiday. I think it's lovely that you budget carefully and use your miles and promos so you can travel, and lovelier still that you sometimes pet sit for friends or family for free. None of that has anything to do with how much someone else chooses to charge for their service. Fortunately, you found a sitter at a lower rate, as is your right. I'm sorry that your ire is piqued.

Your dog does indeed have major medical issues. A healthy 17 year old dog could die any day, and yours is far from healthy. To put that on a dogsitter is wild to be okay with. \n\nAnd her rate is far below the industry standard for a lot of dogsitters, especially during the holidays.", "YTA for leaving Skip with a sitter. What if Skip dies on her watch? I wouldn\u2019t want to risk putting that trauma on someone else.", "Only paying a sitter $35 a day for an incontinent, senile, deaf, and blind senior dog is honestly criminal. This is a dog that can\u2019t be alone and needs 24/7 supervision, you\u2019re paying a sitter less than $2 an hour to care for him. Even $65 a day is less than $3 an hour for his care.\n\nPet sitting and vet care are both things that you don\u2019t cheap out on when you have an animal that you love and want to have the happiest, healthiest life possible. YTA.", "YTA, it's irrelevant how much you charge and your reasoning. This is another person and its completely upto them how much they think their time and effort is worth to look after your dog.\n\nI get it's an inconvenience, but that's why you should secure things more than 4 days in advance. Then you would have knew the price in advance and made a decision. \n\nI dog sit and I'd be charging a lot more than that to be cleaning up your dogs mess on a daily, if at all with your entitled attitude. I equally would have cancelled the entire booking btw - it's not worth the money.", "YTA for being selfish and not thinking about your dog's best interests. Living blind, deaf, and mentally impaired is not a humane way to exist.", "Why are you making your poor Dog Suffer!! There is no way He has quality of life right now. If you did the right thing by your Dog, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about a sitter to begin with.", "Geez\u2026she is getting a small fortune for sitting most of her day\u2026feeding and walking in the yard.

A dog that is deaf, blind, incontinent, demented and at an advanced age is likely drawing little to not quality of life anymore and is probably living in confusion and discomfort. \n\nI know I wouldn\u2019t want to live like that, but that\u2019s just me.", "Whenever someone says \u201cAITA for calling out\u201d they\u2019re usually the AH.\n\nSorry bud.

Taking one special needs dog over a holiday weekend necessitating a drive in from a cabin is different from taking two at some other time. If you want fixed prices, you hire a kennel or licensed insured dog sitter with a fixed price list that accounts for all these possibilities. If you want cheap prices, you take what you can get and pay what your sitter needs for it to be worth it to them - which is usually less than a professional, but more than what little you\u2019d like to pay.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like having handy cousin Joe fix your toilet for $50 and while he\u2019s there he\u2019ll change your tires for ten bucks and install a new light fixture in your kitchen for another tenner. Doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll drive to your place on Christmas eve JUST to change your tires for $10, and it would be absurd to expect him to.", "She didn\u2019t change the price, the previous price was for a different circumstance. This would be a new price, and OP and the sitter both failed to discuss the price ahead of time, but OP is the one being unreasonable in expecting to pay rock bottom fees for the service she wants and for getting grumpy about the sitter\u2019s very reasonable rate of $65.", "Why? Group rates are different from individual rates, because two dogs is way less than double the work/time of one, especially if that one is special needs.", "I catsit for free for my friends and neighbours, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a worthless service.", "But she was the cause of the travel and inconvenience! She's traveling because of the trip she's taking, which is why OP had to find a last minute fill-in sitter in the first place!", "Her travel and inconvenience?  She backed out of those two days to go on a trip with her mother.  Her \"travel\" consists of her coming back home from that trip that she'd have to do even if she wasn't dog sitting.", "That would have been fine if she\u2019d asked ahead of time.  It\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t know the dates.", "Charging for travel is reasonable. However, it isn\u2019t reasonable to only decide to charge for travel after making several commitments. If that was the approach she wanted to take, she should have been upfront about it.", "I agree with you that it is reasonable to account for travel and inconvenience, but the difference in rate should've been disclosed when the dog watcher agreed to watch him for the remainder of the holiday... not 4 days before leaving for the trip, well after she had committed to taking Skip.\n\nNTA", "Fr no one is answering the actual question", "Dementia is horrible. I would wish it on no being. \n\nMy grandpa was in the beginning stages of Dementia. There were moments of clarity that he did *not* want to live like that. His wife, my grandma, suffered from Dementia for years before she passed. He was not going to do that. He stopped taking his medication and stopped eating. He basically just decided to die. \n\nMy husband's aunt spent the last 4 years of her life swinging from being terrified to living in another time/place. When she was \"good\" she wanted to go \"home\". She would talk about being with her deceased parents again.\n\nMy parents had a dog that developed Dementia. He was terrified and confused. He didn't really even recognize my parents. It was heart breaking. \n\nIf you have the ability to humanely end that kind of suffering, you should do it.", "Actually not much. He hasn\u2019t needed much care other than being fed twice a day and being carried to the back yard to potty when he wakes from his naps. He\u2019s not on any meds. He\u2019s still able to walk short distances. He likes cuddles. And he loves his favorite foods.", "Yes, still \u201cthe holidays\u201d.", "That, and eating on her own, are the lines I have for my own aging cat who is 19+ now. When she can\u2019t/won\u2019t use the litter box anymore or eat on her own, it\u2019s curtains. I\u2019d want the same for myself.", "Yeah. My dog is almost there. She\u2019s very confused. Doesn\u2019t see well. Doesn\u2019t hear well. Mostly sleeps or just kinda wanders around, and I honestly think that\u2019s A LOT for a person to handle. And that\u2019s not even considering the fact that she\u2019ll usually still let you know if she has to go out and is on a pretty regular schedule. What the fuck is OP on about? And it\u2019s over a holiday weekend. OP is out of her damn mind lol", "Yes. It\u2019s frustrating and a lot of work.", "I mean, it also isnt. The dog is cared for and content with its life. I have a 20 year old cat who sleeps all day and sits out on the porch, and i help her onto the bed if she wants to. You can have old animals and they are fine. \n\nI dog sat for a neighbor, all i had to do was on my way to and from work let them out and feed the 2 of them. It wasnt hard at all and ive done it before for him. When he got back, i told him things i noticed that had me concerned for the dog, like him not finding his bowl of food despite it being like a foot in front of him, and how he struggled to walk sometimes and such. \n\nHe didn't realize. Hes had the dog for like 15 years so it was just, the dog ya know? But an outsider noticed issues and suggested the vet, and the vet confirmed his blindness and a few other issues. He ultimately made the decision to put the dog down. \n\nI helper him bury Duke, it was the least i could do for pointing out things that led to it. Was it right for the dog? Idk i only saw him 2 days a year.", "They do it for spare money - they take dogs from people who aren\u2019t their friends/family (ie not as a favour). They take easy dogs, in their own homes, and they enjoy it. They charge less than the standard rates but $15/hr would would be $360 per day which is wayyyy more than anyone charges. \n\nI imagine they could charge maybe $60/day if they were insured for it.", ">There's no way I'd do it for less than $15/hr.\n\nThat is more than the going rate \\*by far\\*.\n\nIt's an extremely passive gig for most dogs. You're basically charging someone to allow their dog to occupy the same space as you while you go about your life at home and occasionally (once every 2-6 hours) letting them out to pee. You might feed them once or twice, but even that takes all of 2 minutes per meal.\n\nI couldn't imagine charging someone $135 for an 8 hour work day (plus travel time) for that, and I personally do not know any dog owners who would willingly pay that amount given what the job entails.", "That's not always a bonus to have a stranger hanging out in your house for a week", "Maybe they mean they charge $25 a day and spend half an hour with the cat to make sure the cat is fed and has water and to clean the litter box? Hopefully?", "What incentive? I'm curious because I would think if it was a shady/financial one, they would milk any little thing they could by turning common old age issues into major issues.", "Cuz it sounds like the agreed price is 30 for one dog and 35 for the other, that's not a group rate, that's an individual rate per dog, if there's only one dog you only get the price for the one dog", "I never said it was.", "Would you come back early from family holiday for a full day that pays 30-35 dollars, probably doesn't even cover gas lol", "Lol op isn't her full time boss sounds like she is doing op a favour and the dog needs extra care", "She's doing op the favour here, $30 a day is an insane expectation", "Thankfully my cat (also 19+) just didn\u2019t like how high our old litter box was due to her more limited mobility. Once we got her a lower box she went back to using it fine, but it was certainly not low maintenance on the meantime following her every time we thought she might need to use it to help her.", "Give her a fair shot with a box that has one low side. Equivalent to an higher toilet for a senior.", "More good days than bad is my guideline. I had a Aussie shepherd that lived to 19. She needed a ramp and rarely made it more than a few feet into the yard.", "yeah I sure tf hope so...", "Individual rates are reduced when there are multiple dogs. Think of it more as the price per day for it to be worth it for Betty to pack a bag and stay in someone else\u2019s home, or make the trip to pick up the dog, etc. The \u201cregular rate\u201d does not apply because this is a different scenario.\n\n$35 per night for a special needs dog sitting with pickup over a holiday weekend is extremely low, even if it\u2019s only one dog. $65 is more reasonable even if it\u2019s two dogs. OP should absolutely have clarified this at the outset rather than assume $35 per night.", "Then what\u2019s the relevance?", "It\u2019s not an insane expectation because that\u2019s what the sitter\u2019s going rate was. They had used her before, multiple times. Whether or not she\u2019s doing OP a favor is irrelevant- if your rates are going to change for any reason, you should be upfront about it at the time of the booking.", "For someone who budgets tightly, it makes a difference. The sitter who we found eventually is saving us $200. I guess my point is if she didn\u2019t like the rate, she had a right to refuse the job from the beginning. But she accepted that rate for the past 2 jobs. I think anyone would like to know a rate change in advance vs 4 days before.", "I'm not going out my way to make $30 and losing a holiday day with my family, sorry gotta make it worth her while", "That\u2019s a group rate though. She charged you a total of $65 for two dogs, in your house. Your one extremely special needs dog in your house isn\u2019t worth ~half the total rate. It\u2019s more than half the work and half the time commitment.\n\nI understand the misunderstanding that led you here but I think you should have clarified the rate of one dog vs a group rate.\n\nIn any case, it worked out fine. Chalk it up to a misunderstanding and lesson learned.", "Have you ever used the other sitter before? Oftentimes there is a difference in level of care someone provides. You have an elderly dog that almost requires constant care. I'm not saying either of you are wrong I'm just trying to give another take on the situation.", "I think you\u2019re missing the entire point here. These is absolutely no issue with the sitter charging what she feels her time is worth. She could charge $200 a day and it would not make what I\u2019m saying different. The *entire point* is that you need to be upfront with how much you are charging.", "Yep with stuff like this, sometimes you get what you paid for.\n\nAny time I\u2019ve used a sitter that was substantially undercutting the market, I certainly discovered why", "She has 2 elder dogs as well."]}
