First of all, in many case much more ideal for a family to not have to pay child care costs at all than it is for the two parents to split the costs. For many family having one parent at home allows them to have a small surplus of money left over after all do the bills are paid as opposed to just breaking even. Second, being a SAHP is very stressful. It\u2019s just as stressful as working outside of the home, if not more so. I know mothers who went back to work because the stress of being a SAHM is overwhelming. Finally, I guarantee that OP\u2019s wife is doing a lot more than watching the kids. She\u2019s probably doing all do the household chores as well. Even if all she was doing was watching the kids, she\u2019s doing more than enough. Why do you think that childcare is so expensive? It\u2019s because talking care is kids is hard work."]}
