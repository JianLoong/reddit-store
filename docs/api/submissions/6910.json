She doesn't have an independent source of income that provides her financial stability to do the thing she needs to do or protect herself in the long run.

Just one person and hope they had it in their hearts to ensure that I had money to just take care of myself if I needed to.\n\nSo NTA is my ultimate verdict but I think if you don't share it, this will just be a really big thorn in your marriage that she will resent and hold against you. Purely for the fact that she does not have her own source of income. It's a security thing.... Essentially you feel like your work is worth nothing. And yes it's work. It's fuckton a lot of work.

As there are more families who have 2 working parents than 1 working parent, as a 1 working parent in a family now is more considered a privilege.\n\nAlso there are families out there who only have 1 parent and they manage (barely) to pay for everything on their own whilst holding a job and looking after their children.", "Neither of us have any idea what their division of labour is.

Apparently, she never said anything because it worked in her favor. Now that it doesn\u2019t work for her she said something and now he\u2019s the bad guy for saying no. If it was in her mind this year as unfair, that means it was in her mind before as unfair. \n\nHe may have not said anything before because he didn\u2019t care. But she brings it up as unfair now and he said but wait a second? And your logic is having a memory and bringing up that she thought it was fair before is vindictive.", "Not taking anything away from the challenge, Iam just pointing out that it is a mutually benificial agreement. It's not like she's giving him a benifit and getting nothing in return. Both are making sacrifices for what they believe to be in the best interest of the family. OP gets less time with the children, time that is limited. And while I very much respect the WORK(because it is work) that a sahp puts in, it also has some great benifits. Things like being there for your children and being able to be very present in their lives and getting to experience all the moments that would be missed being in the office.", "Yeah she just being spoiled. He should definitely add that all money is discussed besides this money. Would make it way easier to judge NTA.", "Good point", "^I agree with this. A relationship wont last if you care about \"getting even\". If you're wondering what else you could have done you could have given her less than half because its for Christmas but are you required to? No, should you have? You tell me. If you want to be happy with someone you need to realize nothing is ever fair in this world", "In which case, I'm not mad at her for not splitting it then. It would be different if she had refused.", "Because \"he asked and she refused and is now asking\" is different than \"he didn't ask and now she's asking and he's refusing.\"", "Moral justification is not gonna keep the other side of the bed warm at night, ya know?", "And her money is hers but not theirs? If he's paying all the bills he's sharing his money with anyone who benefits from that. Wife could always get a job and they could pay daycare lol. Nobody wants to talk about that though.", "And where was his mental health and his need for me money when he got a small bonus?", "But op used his mouth this time and she can't take no for an answer?", "It would be helpful around here to add that info in based on the crazy stuff people see on this sub and the constant jump to \"x abuse\" in this case finacial. But I think most normal people would leave that info out because it seems common sense that since she is sahm the money goes into a joint account. That just isn't the common thing around here in the asshole echo chamber, since people tend to bring the worst things here.", "But honestly, if she's a SAHM - which directly enables him to have his career with the bonus - she should get \"hobby money\" if it's affordable between the two of them. \n\nIf her hobby money is limited to what her parents gift her, while his hobby money is from work he directly affects (and is able to do because of her staying home), that's hugely unfair.", "Oh he needed to ask her? Didn't she notice that his bonus was only $100 while she got $1000 from her parents?", "Someone who sees reason! Thank you!", "Op's grievance is that he didnt expect her to split her money with him even if it was unfair to him, but she expects him to split it with her and doesnt care that she was unfair to him then, and she is being unfair to him now! The double standard of her reasoning/rule is what is bothering op, and making it a hill he is willing to die on.", "Gross", "That's a non-issue, he didn't ask for it and didn't expect it.  If he had asked her to split it then, and she refused siting the rule, that would be one thing.  But he didn't, he even states he didn't expect her to.\n\nWe can't change time, so no one can know for sure if she would have said yes and split the money with him.  And that situation is long past and should be treated separately from this one.  Hence why now that there an issue, they should re-negotiate the deal, because obviously the original deal was in place with different circumstances in play.\n\nThey can literally decide whatever they want to make it fair.  He can have $200/month taken from his pay and split into her personal account and his personal account (100 each, so they both have $1200 me money at the end of the year), then agree that any bonus money or parent money goes into the shared account, so they both have their \"me money\".\n\nThere are lots of ways that it can be done fairly.  But to just shut his SAHM wife down and tell her, figuratively \"sucks to be her\", is not one of them.  They need to re-negotiate the terms of their arrangement.", "Agreed.", "Prudent, you basically said what I was going to. He is NTA. His wife is more than just a business partner. He loves her. He would die for her. They are each others best friends and life partners. She is wrong in this situation and he should show her grace.\n\nHe should split the money with her, and use this as a way to change it for future Christmas seasons. You both should split unexpected income, Christmas gifts, bonuses, etc. That's the only fair way. I would also budget for personal fun money in the future for both you and your wife.", "But if he didn't bring it up at the time, he doesn't get to hold it against her.", "I know plenty of people who budget this way, and a large amount of them have this budget so they pay the bills and then they spent the leftover. There is no indication that he doesn\u2019t do this. If he wants a new game and the bills are paid and he has money, we don\u2019t know that he doesn\u2019t do that. You\u2019re just trying to assume the worst about OP\u2019s wife.", "Yes! This! Just more eloquently written. Lol.", "People are expecting OP to be 'fair' to his wife when she wasn't 'fair' to him. Why would he need to ask his wife, the man she should be willing to die for, for a share of her 'bonus'? Shouldn't she have noticed the discrepancy and willingly shared without him having to ask?", "No you are trying to assume her best. 63% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.  You assume there was money leftover AND that it wasn't put into saving. And that that he was exclusively using it to spend on himself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are things we don't know that you are assuming specifically so the guy comes off worst."]}
