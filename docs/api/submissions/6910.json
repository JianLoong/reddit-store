Purely for the fact that she does not have her own source of income. It's a security thing.... Essentially you feel like your work is worth nothing. And yes it's work. It's fuckton a lot of work.

In his role as the husband, he chose not to complain or ask her for when he only received 100. He chose to accept the difference and not ask out of selflessness, likely thinking \u201cshe works hard as a mom.\u201d Whatever the though for his not asking is, be chose selflessness. She on the other hand chose selfishly not to even check to see how he felt about the difference.

My cousin is actually a lawyer so her husband stays home, and I know they had to work out some kinks along the way!) \n\nI do want to add in I saw in a comment from OP that his wife takes yoga & pottery classes, which is great!

Yes, you're saying OP is N-T-A, but you're also saying he should be the bigger person, AND he should keep all the money this year if he can't be. That's like a backhanded judgment to me. \n\nThe problem with being the bigger person on this specific issue from your framework is that it means the partner who works a 9-5, puts all of their money in a joint account that the other partner has full access to, and is a parent after work shouldn't have the autonomy to spend that little bit of spare cash on themselves. And honestly, whatever figure you'd want to split by is always going to be tit-for-tat.\n\n \"OK, Marsha, here's your 400 dollars from my bonus, I know that the new TV you wanted is 450, but you can always get a tablet instead!\" I mean, there's no clean way to do that without hurting someone's feelings or it being perceived as unfair. Gifts or bonuses should be allowed to be separate if it's financially feasible.

This happens once, maybe twice a year. I don't go counting receipts and budgeting for a trip to Vegas with my employees or Mom to make it even. She earned that trip, and I know that if I were to plan that trip to Vegas or wherever with my Mom, she's not getting bent out of shape. She will always have more opportunities to go on trips than me, and I'm extremely happy for her. Being able to be comfortable with your partner to splurge on themselves the couple times a year when you can afford it is also a big part of marriage. This is the first time in a while it seems Mom didn't get her gift as high as it usually is. I don't think it's being petty when she treated Dad the same way when his bonus wasn't as large, either. \n\nNow, if the argument is that Mom should have more opportunities to splurge on herself outside of a gift or bonus, I'll agree to that. But it doesn't seem like their marriage functions that way for Dad either. Sharing has to be unconditional, and it's not for either of them. Does that make them assholes? Kinda, but in this specific situation, Dad doesn't have to be the bigger person to me. He earned it, and he gets to do what he wants without the guilt trip or backhanded Reddit judgment.", "I think the difference between his and her situation is that he didn't bother asking.

Or does she pick through Target sales bins so as not to \"waste\" their family's money on a shirt when her old one is probably \"fine\"? \n\nOr in food: does OP casually buy lunch at work while she feels guilty dropping a snack she wants into the grocery cart if she's not going to share it?\n\nBeing a financial dependent gets in your head.

She also gets to do such things as yoga and pottery classes while OP gets to do such things as work and work. Sorry, but once your kids start going to daycare, pre-school, or regular school, being a stay-at-home parent is absolutely nowhere close to a full-time job. Maybe over the break weeks and months it is, but during the school year, it's absolutely far less work. And working parents almost always say on surveys that they want to spend more time with their kids but in  households where one partner is a stay-at-home parent, often the other partner is forced to work more hours to make up the gap in income left by their partner staying home so they get to spend even fewer hours with their children.\n\nAll that said, this marriage is doomed to fail because neither of the people see the other as a partner but just a roommate with benefits and kids.", "No but he did mansplain. \"I didn't ask you so it's unfair for you to ask me and I wasn't expecting you to ask me because I didn't ask you\" attitude.

NAH.\n\nOP is NTA because of no obligation, which is the answer to the question asked... but OP is definitely an ah for thinking marriage is only about how it conveniences/benefits you and not a relationship where you support each other. It's not like OP asked wife \"hey I only got $100 this year can we combine our spending money this year?\" and was told \"No\" before wife asked the same question of him a few years later. The fact of the matter is that OP did *not* communicate a request for a temporary adaptation of the agreement, so when OP's wife communicated a request for a temporary adaptation of the agreement OP reared back and thought her selfish. It's not the same thing. There's no comparison. His wife is made an offer -- a proposal, if you will -- based on an opportunity that she considered beneficial and a part of how support in marriage works, and he declined said proposal because he didn't consider it beneficial or in line with the terms of their agreement.
