His parents (especially my MIL) have been extremely helpful helping with the baby. She cleans up, picks up our clothes and does our laundry every day, cooks us meals, sleeps over and does the night shift so we can sleep, and will pretty much do anything we need from her. \n\nI am grateful for everything she does. The problem is that we live in a studio apartment and having her over all the time makes it really difficult for me. I\u2019m 3 weeks post partum and still figuring out my baby, breastfeeding and pumping. It is extremely hard to do that with my MIL in the studio with us. \n\nDespite this, I let her come over because she\u2019s been extremely helpful. Yesterday though, she did something which I felt was inappropriate. \n\nSh had slept over for 2 nights doing the night shift with the baby and spent 3 days with us. I was so happy when she finally left after 3 days and I could just relax and enjoy my baby. \n\nThen she texted me asking when was a good time to drop off laundry and lunch. I was a bit annoyed because she\u2019d already spent 3 days over and I hadn\u2019t asked for laundry or lunch to be dropped off and I just needed my space for a day. She made sure to write in her text \u201cjust dropping off, not staying.\u201d\n\nThen when she came over, her husband dropped her off and left and she started cleaning up. I was literally in shock that she was staying in our apt, not being invited, and after prefacing that she wasn\u2019t staying. I was visibly upset so she decided to step out and my husband and I got into a huge fight and he called me ungrateful and basically said that I have to accept her being over all the time if I want her help. \n\nThen they both guilted me and made me feel ungrateful because I don\u2019t want her in my space because she\u2019s doing everything for us. \n\nI am extremely grateful for all her help but she is overstaying her welcome and crossing boundaries. \n\nAITA for being overwhelmed by her and getting annoyed with her despite all her help?\n\n\nEDIT: \n\n1. We live in a studio apartment which is 400 square feet so there is literally nowhere else for me to go when his mom is over. \n\n2. my husband is also in graduate school and has his finals now, so I feel guilty when I don\u2019t have his mom help out because it takes away from his studying time and he\u2019s exhausted if he has to stay up with the baby and then will do badly in school. And his mom is also guilting me basically saying she has to help us so he can study, and it makes me feel like if I reject her help it makes me selfish.\n\nAlso for those commenting that my husband isn\u2019t helpful, he actually is extremely helpful, and always bottle feeds the baby and changes diapers.

It stops being help when it\u2019s forced on you. \n\nYou will need to speak up clearly, don\u2019t be vague. \n\n\u201cthank you for offering to drop off the laundry but today doesn\u2019t work for me. Can we see you Xday or Yday instead?\u201d \n\n\u201cI need a few days without company. We will let you know when we\u2019re ready for a visit.  Thank you for understanding.\u201d", "What an amazing MIL. Question, why isn\u2019t your husband doing all those things? What is he doing whilst you are looking after yourself and the baby? Is he working full time? If that\u2019s the case then keep the MIL. All those things she is doing you would end up doing since hubby doesn\u2019t seem capable.", "NTA. No, you don't have to accept her crossing your boundaries and overstaying if you want her help. Your husband is wrong. He needs to be on the same page as you are, and he needs to talk to his mother.\n\nYou might need to set some kind of rule about days on/off and needing an invitation by this point.\n\nEDIT: I also wonder if maybe hubby needs to learn how to do some of these things his mother is doing? I mean, he's also a new father and needs to learn this role.", "NTA. You need privacy and time to bond with your baby, not MIL 24/7. Your husband is absolutely wrong.", "Nta \n\nIs your husband doing anything to help? \n\nI just had a baby and the last thing I wanted was my mother in law at my house daily.", "NTA \n\nI don't think it's out of line for you to ask for some space, even if she is super helpful. It sounds like MIL didn't realize she was bothering you until things had already boiled over, hence why she stepped out before the fight. \n\nI think your husband is being pretty unfair. He can easily step up and help out. He's a grown ass man. His mommy shouldn't be coming over every hour to clean up for him.\n\nYou guys could work out some sort of schedule that everyone agrees on. Like MIL comes over 2 or 3 times a week?", "NTA - It is good that you MIL wants to do all this for you, however you,  your husband and new baby also need serious bonding time together alone. Your MIL is only trying to do what she can to make things easier, but she is overstaying her welcome a bit. If she came over every 3 days to help pick up the house or laundry that would be more acceptable at least. On the other hand, as each day passes, there is no reason for you not to be able to get all this done on your own while the baby sleeps, unless you have more than one child. That would give her less reasons to be needed and overstay her welcome.", "I will say you are NTA but you need to quit relying on her. If you didn't want her help you and your husband should have been getting up and showing her she wasn't needed for the night shift as an example.", "NTA. You have more of a husband problem than a MIL problem, you have boundaries, your MIL seem to at least sensed your boundaries by saying \"just dropping off, not staying\". Your husband however is comfortable with mama doing all the work around the house and ignored your boundaries. I'd start talking to him about splitting chores around the house so when MIL offer her help you can say \"We've already got it done, thank you for all your help\"", "If the help is mandatory and you're not allowed to say no to it, it's not really help. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHas your MIL always been this helpful with her controlling ways?  It sounds like your husband thinks this is fine and unfortunately this is his normal and he's watched it for years.  Things like this tend to get worse after you have a child.\n\nYou need  boundaries.. but if your husband isn't on your side, he is against you.  And they are hard to hold.  I would lock myself in the bedroom with the baby and just feed and sleep.  Husband can stay in the spare room with the MIL.\n\nWhat if you said to him that you are happy not to accept her help at all if she won't leave you alone.\n\nWhere's your family?  Can you go and stay with them for a week or three?  Or a close friend.  This is no different to your MIL staying with you.. both are family , one doesn't trump the other. If your MIL or husband think it's a problem... then you actually have bigger problems than you realised.", "ESH. If she got your drift that you were a little miffed with her unexpected, and certainly unannounced plans to stay, then she\u2019s working real hard to blow right past you on what you want. Yes it\u2019s great that she\u2019s helping and I\u2019m sure you do appreciate it. But you also have to walk a fine line with biting the hand that feeds you. You\u2019re only three weeks postpartum so nerves are frazzled and you do get a pass on that. I\u2019m just saying you have to be careful about the way you approach this, but you\u2019re not truly an asshole here, I\u2019m just saying you have to look at it from her and your possibly slacker husband\u2018s point of view.   All they see and focus on his how much she\u2019s doing and now you look ungrateful. Again I don\u2019t think for one second you\u2019re an asshole I would be way way way more tired of this by now than you are. I had no one to come help and I managed everything just fine, maybe you need to start trying overnights like other people often do also.\n\nAlso really interested in what your husband does around the house. The three of you should sit down together and talk about everything that\u2019s been going on. Remind her first and foremost how much you appreciate her help and truly love her, presuming you do. Discuss in detail this particular incident, and remind her she explicitly stated just to drop off. Then suddenly she\u2019s staying without any word of explanation.  It is very reasonable to be unpleasantly surprised by that, considering she had just stayed the previous three entire days.", "NAH I think your MIL is incredibly kind to help you out so much in such a difficult time. but I think it's also clear that you're grateful for it. you are allowed to want some privacy and alone time.\n\nI think it would be good to discuss openly and directly what kind of help you'd like from her and the boundaries you want to set. if your husband continues to be unreasonable, he's welcome to do all the tasks your MIL is doing. you deserve to rest during your recovery!", "MIL needs to stay home.  You can handle your baby yourself.", "NTA", "You don\u2019t need her to do anything for you except hold the baby when you visit her at her house. Start adulting. You and your partner do everything yourselves and tell her to stay home.\n\nESH", "You and your husband both need to learn to have proper communication.\nYou'd give you both a pass as you are new parents and it could be overwhelming.\nStop this fight and make up.\n\nHowever say some nice and appreciate words to your MIL, she's an angel.\n\nI get you need some time for yourself but pls convey it in a polite manner.\n\nNAH", "YTA- so you want the free maid service but are annoyed when she overstays her welcome? Why is your husband not helping more, and if you\u2019re MIL is doing all that work, what on earth are you two doing?", "NTA your MIL should give you some space to get used to being a mum/ looking after your own baby.", "NTA. But don't expect or ask for any help. You can learn these things on your own, and to prioritize your time. Most babies sleep 20+ hours a day at this stage. This is the easy stage lol. Just tell her you appreciate it, and you're set from here to take over, & \"we'll see you in a week or two when we come to visit\" so she gets the hint.", "ESH. Your husband needs to do better. And I get where you are coming from COMPLETELY but I\u2019m gonna be 100% honest with you. You are incredibly fortunate to have such a caring MIL. I had postpartum pain for weeks longer than usual because I could not sit still to rest. I understand the privacy thing as all I had for a door at the time was a fabric hung on command hooks and I lived with my entire family. I\u2019d recommend you ask politely for a week or so without visiting so your new little family can have some time alone for bonding. I stress politely because odds are in the matter of that week you\u2019ll probably be asking her to come back fr fr. Everything she\u2019s doing is what your husband should be doing- you won\u2019t have anymore peace without her there because he\u2019ll likely refuse to pick up the slack her absence leaves. One thing you\u2019ll learn in this parenting journey is (1) it does take a village and (2) that help won\u2019t always be so forthcoming so cherish it while you have it.

Is it possible for you all to go stay at your in-laws so everyone has more space?... assuming they have a house or larger apartment.", "its amazing how she is so willing to help. but you also have right to say no and not want her around for a while. you need to be able to adjust what looking after a baby alone is like and figure things out, like the night shift, breastfeeding etc especially given that it seems as though your husband isn't doing really any parenting. your husband is being selfish by only thinking about what he wants and not what you need.", "I think OP needs to decide whether they need the help or not. You can't say 'I don't want the laundry to be dropped off today'. You can say 'I appreciate the help but don't need you doing my laundry, and I need some space and alone time with the baby.' \n\nThose are different. The first one means 'do my chores when I say so', and it's an asshole move. Not saying that OP is there, but she's described what her MIL does as... Basically everything.

If MIL comes to help so she can spend as much time as possible around the family but doesn't want to do as much if she's just allowed in to do chores and then must leave immediately that's fair enough.\n\nThat said obviously OP could choose to do more by herself and husband should definitely help with that.", "They are all wrong.

Otherwise don't bother with acting like you actually want to offer them the help they need.", "No, I'm sorry, but you can absolutely say not today please about people being in your own home, whoever they are. The MIL clearly understands this better than the husband because she recognised that actually it wasn't a great time to be over and she probably should have stuck to what she said. Nowhere in this has the MIL come back and said anything about the situation. She's given the space that was needed at that time.\n\nWhen you have a new baby, hormones are all over the shop, as helpful as someone doing all the chores may be on the surface, sometimes you need to be able to just settle in to being a new parent. Especially in a tiny flat. Having your MIL in your face when you have your boobs out every couple of hours feeding or pumping is not a comfortable situation for anyone.

Please show your husband these replies and hopefully he will see sense.", "NTA. Be clear but kind. My MIL came over every day when I had my 1st baby. I had 12 weeks of maternity leave, and I only had 5 days (not consecutive) without her there. She drove me CRAZY. My husband said, \"She is just excited,\" to which I screamed, \" I am just exhausted! Tell her to back off, or I will!\" So, my next two kids, I allowed hospital visits, then a month at home with no visitors, and after the month, Every time MIL invited her self over, or just dropped by unannounced, we said now is not a good time and didnt allow her in. We got visits down to once a week. Now we live a plane ride or 20 hour drive away. My husband even admitted later MIL was driving him crazy and was happy we made and enforced our boundary. He is even happier we live too far for the \"surprise visits\"", "NTA. Your body is healing and you need time to adjust. Even if you appreciate the help, there is A LOT going on with your body that you aren\u2019t familiar with (I\u2019m trained as a post partum doula).

Mil seems incredibly helpful, but you also sound overwhelmed and needing some space. You're still figuring this all out and haven't had much time to just be you and baby. You need to say what you're feeling. She can't know a.boundary if You haven't given her one. You need to let her know you want to try doing it yourself, because mil can't be around all the time and how will you learn if she's always doing everything for you? It's helpful at the start but it's not some thing that can go on forever", "A soft YTA, but only because you\u2019re a very new mom and your emotions and hormones are doing cartwheels. You want your MILs help. You enjoy her help. She even takes nightshifts so you and husband can sleep. She does many, many nice things for you and your husband, she really goes far beyond what is normal. But you\u2019re annoyed with her being around? Well, then you have no help. Your husband will have to step up, as will you. Are you sure you want that and are ready for that? Cause if I was your MIL, you and husband could now 100% take care of that baby yourselves.", "NAH but you're going to realize pretty soon how awesome she is when she stops covering the nightshift (which apparently your husband can't do due to school), your home becomes a mess from limited cleaning, and you realize that someone needs to start cooking food. You can want her gone but if you're struggling now I imagine that you're going to start struggling a lot more when you have all those tasks to do and an irritable husband (either from grouchiness over the situation, school stress, and now increased baby work stress, the last of which was bound to happen eventually). \n\nP.S. Congrats and good luck!", "YTA, just talk to her and say you need some space, but were happy for all the help so far.  \nIf you don't say anything nobody will know...  \n\nDoesn't anyone in this sub know how to use their words anymore??", "I don't think anyone is the AH here. \n\nYou're going though a huge thing, full of hormones, recovering from a massive medical experience, learning how to navigate being a mother and having to deal with a new born. It's all change in all your lives. \n\nYour MIL is obviously being a wonderful help and supporting you in many ways. It sounds like she's going above and beyond. \n\nI think the important thing here is to communicate. Tell her you're unbelievably grateful for her help but you're finding everything overwhelming, especially having 4 people in such a small space. Just tell her you need a bit of time alone and work out the best solution to for everyone's needs. \n\nI appreciate your husband is studying right now, but life changes with a newborn and he's going to have to get used to that. His mother can't help you out forever. \n\nDoes MIL have a larger house? Maybe you could spend a few nights at hers with your own room to be able to get a bit of private space but still have the help? \n\nI don't think anyone is in the wrong here and I'm sure you're utterly overwhelmed and exhausted. The best course of action is to talk about it reasonably with all parties and work out a solution. You're allowed to want a bit of space to yourself, that's not being ungrateful, it's not an all or nothing situation. But the way you explain your needs is also important. Your husband needs to listen to what you need right now and help you out.", "Nta. That woman will never leave you alone. Good luck with your husband/mommy wedding and life.", "What are you doing while she is doing everything? Tell her you are now a mum, and you have to do the mum things and housekeeping, or you won't learn to do it. It is 3 weeks, you should be doing everything without her help. Yta, tell her straight, to be a nanny and not a house cleaner, cook, laundry person, etc.", "NTA. You have the right to feel comfortable in your own home. It's not being ungrateful to want some boundaries and privacy. Your MIL is very very kind for helping so much be she still has to respect YOUR home.\n\nThe only thing you might be a tiny AH for is not communicating your feelings earlier. It's never a good idea to bottle up your frustration because you just end up exploding (which kinda happened here) and look ungrateful. But your husband's response is BS. Of course accepting her help doesn't mean she has to be over ALL THE TIME.", "NTA, however, you need to talk to your MIL. The need for help and the need for quite healing are incompatible with company in 400 sq feet. Hormones and exhaustion make a terrible brew. Please let her know how much you appreciate the help but you really need time for a peaceful recovery too. Maybe come up with a plan \ud83e\udd14 \nHolding your tongue until you snapped is not the same as setting boundaries, and MIL really had no way to read minds. Just talk to her, honestly. Set up boundaries and expectations for both of you.", "Well, this is a lot.\n\nAs an introvert, I am proud of you for keeping your feelings hidden for 3 whole weeks. Bravo. I'd have had no family left by the end of 3 weeks, because I'd have run away with my baby.\n\nHelp is excellent and you want grandparents to love on & bond to their grandchildren, too. Extended families are important. \n\nBut your MIL is focusing her help on her son. Not you. Not the baby.  They have both told you he needs to focus on finals & school.  Finals aren't 3 fucking weeks long and, if it takes that long for him to prep, how dumb is he?  Has he been paying any attention to schoolwork before now? He knew a baby was coming.\n\nI'm going to guess MIL is very traditional and has always enabled your husband's sense of male privilege. I'm also guessing he might not have been terribly helpful during the pregnancy, if you needed anything. Same reason. Focus on school. On success. He shouldn't have to do \"womanly\" things that distract him from his goals. That's what Mommy (and you) are for. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI don't think you're changing either of these people anytime soon.\n\nIf you are okay with handling the new baby & everything your MIL is doing, I'd ask for some space & bonding time with your immediate family.  You need a break from extra people in your tiny space. If you need the help, I'd apologize & take up meditation or something.\n\nDon't have more kids with this giant baby who needs his mommy to do his parenting for him until you see whether he snaps out of it eventually. A couple years between kids should do it.\n\nAlso, don't sideline YOUR career prospects for too long. If MIL wants to be sure her giant baby boy isn't inconvenienced, she can help defray daycare costs.\n\nOfc, all this is not the actual baby's fault.  Babies can be (and often are) utterly wonderful. Breastfeeding that goes well is so peaceful and blissful. The bonds created between mother and child during that time are magical; and help you through those pesky toddler years. \ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA, but you may need to suck it up and put up with a couple AHs for a bit. Focus on your physical health and your beautiful baby. \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta. You're not being ungrateful but perhaps you can communicate better with both of them. \"I love you and I am extremely grateful for your help, but I need space sometimes so I can have peace and quiet to heal and bond with my baby. I'm not asking, I'm telling. Let's work out a schedule that works well for all of us\"", "NTA\n\nYou need both privacy and bonding with the baby. Husband is the one who needs to be setting boundaries with his mom.\n\nMIL ignored your request not to stay, set boundaries. She loses drop off privileges. You are not being ungrateful; you are being ignored by MIL. She is not being helpful when she is doing this because she is creating a negative environment for you. At this point, I would say you don't want her help just to get her to stop.\n\nIf Husband doesn't like it, he needs to be the one setting boundaries with mom to avoid future confrontations. He can deal with the baby and studying if he can't even set a single boundary. He's a dad now; he's gonna be tired whether he likes it or not. Sleep goes before chores go. That's the reality of having a newborn", "NTA\n\nYou are just overwhelmed. They are both trying to help but sometimes that's hard to accept.\n\nJust be honest: you do appreciate and are grateful but it's hard right now and you need a little more space than you can get - in any other circumstance you would love to have her there as much but the one room factor is just a lot. \n\nBe sure to tell them you wish you didn't feel this way bc you are so grateful but you just can't control your feelings right now and need a LITTLE space to try and balance out and adapt", "NTA. Maybe your husband should step up in his mom\u2019s absence.

She will be running the risk of offending MIL and getting no further help. It is what it is. \n\nOP has to decide if its worth taking on extra work to have MIL out of her space.", "I'm criticising the mixed signals and the lack of clear communication.

Help is only help if you want it. Full stop.", "Down vote me but yes. One should never look at help as being burdensome. You say you are grateful but don't act like it.

People are allowed to need help, *and also* to need space to decompress and regulate their nervous system.", "Completely agree with this, you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it. Whilst admittedly fresh PP is *the hardest* time ever and a new mum is entitled to her space (and believe me I do get it, I didn\u2019t let anyone near me or my newborn until I was ready and I didn\u2019t care if it offended them) you can\u2019t have it both ways. I was surprised by how helpful, amenable and aware the MIL sounded to be honest, I thought this was going to be a classic \u2018MIL is overstepping\u2019 post but she\u2019s not. You can\u2019t want her help but then not actually want her to be physically around give you that help OP, I\u2019m sorry. You have to work out what it is you want from your MIL and then properly communicate that with her. You can\u2019t resent her for doing something you want her to do, you\u2019re creating unrealistic goals for her and it\u2019s not fair.", "I mean, it seems to me that MIL is taking on a lot of tasks that should be her son\u2019s.  MIL isn\u2019t there to help OP, she\u2019s there to make sure her son doesn\u2019t have to take too much responsibility for the baby and his wife so that he can still study.\n\nI would be more than willing to say:  \u201chun, your mom is doing the work that would normally be mostly yours as the baby\u2019s father and my husband, as my first job right now is to heal from labor and continue to nourish myself and the baby, as I have done for the last nine months.  That job involves some light housework, but nothing I can\u2019t handle.  Your mom isn\u2019t primarily here to support me \u2014 she\u2019s doing your job.  And she\u2019s doing it so that you can be more successful in school.  And I can tolerate that to a point because the timing of this sucks with your school schedules and it\u2019s a big adjustment.  But YOU are supposed to be my partner and coparent, not your mom.  If you are outsourcing your job as coparent so you can focus on your job as student, I can work around that.  But I did not consent to be in a triad so that you could have a sexy wife and a mommy wife around full time to handle your part of this.\n\nEither find a way to cover your coparenting duties that allows me privacy in my own house or go stay with her until finals are over and I\u2019ll focus on doing only what\u2019s necessary to keep babu and me thriving here.\u201d\n\nCause MIL ain\u2019t there for OP.", "NTA- You shouldn't be badgered or guilt tripped just because you want to be alone with your baby. You're the mother but nobody is thinking about your needs.", "NTA except for not saying something before you got so upset. I am a little confused on how you are sleeping through a crying baby at night in a studio apartment. But good for you. MIL knows her son is busy and unable to help, so I guess she is trying to pick up the slack. Speak up. Tell MIL her help has been so appreciated. You want to try having a few days every week be just you and the baby.  You and MIL make a schedule. MIL won't be able to do everything she has been to the same level. Get ready to step up and get those pesky chores done on less sleep. That's the life of a new mom.", "NTA -\nI think this can be easily worked out, OP. You\u2019re so tired and overwhelmed with a new and I\u2019d bet your mil remembers this - she sounds pretty kind and considerate. I think if you have a conversation, or write a note if you express yourself better that way, thanking her for everything she\u2019s done and apologizing for any misunderstanding. Explain that sometimes you need time alone and that you get overwhelmed when you don\u2019t have your own space - that as much you need her help, you also need some time on your own to figure out your baby. Ask her how you can work around those needs so you all get what you need. Your need to just quietly (well maybe not so quietly) bond with your baby is just as important as your husband\u2019s study time.", "NTA. And your MIL is so kind! But also overstepping. \n\nYou have to have space to learn all this. \n\nYou haven\u2019t been this baby\u2019s mom. That infant hasn\u2019t been your baby. Y\u2019all are learning each other. \n\nThe overnight shifts were an AWESOME idea. Maybe go home for the day and come back at night.", "I wish your husband was as understanding and considerate with ur needs as you are of his when it comes to studying and letting her stay because of him.\nNTA. u have the right to your own privacy.", "NTA \n\nAnd for anyone to shame you right now for your reactions to *anything* is so far out of line it\u2019s not even funny.

You have allowed this. A little help is okay but you just had a baby, you are not an invalid.  You and your husband are parents now.  Act like it.  MIL did what she thought was helpful but you two let it go way overboard and now there is resentment and hurt feelings.  Night duty??  Really??  This was all so unnecessary.", "NTA- she\u2019s being intrusive, not helpful.", "NTA- she\u2019s not being helpful; she\u2019s barging in. She\u2019s not respecting your wishes. You can totally tell her thanks, but no thanks.", "And how much sleep do they really get if the baby is sleeping in the same room AND so is MIL? Won't they wake up when baby wakes up or when MIL moves around? Not saying MIL isn't helpful but it is still FOUR people in one room!", "At first, I was like...NOPE! But, that actually might not be a horrible idea depending how big MIL's house is. OP says they value the help greatly - they just want some privacy. The irony is she may low key get more space, privacy, and rest in MIL's home where she can close/lock a door than in her own studio apartment.\n\nI lived in a studio apt just out of college. Even by myself it could feel super tight. I know I couldn't share one with a partner - let alone a partner and a baby. And, certainly not with anyone else. But, there is something about  being able to have a bedroom door that you can close and get a bit of privacy.....", "So if a neighbor helps in your yard, they can plan a bbq in it? \n\nYou can absolutely not want someone helping all the time. That *normal*.", ">  But I did not consent to be in a triad so that you could have a sexy wife and a mommy wife around full time to handle your part of this.\n\nThis is a huge, unreasonable escalation that does not in any way convey the reality of the situation. If OP wants to really start an argument, this will be the way to do it.", "Except it absolutely does. The situation has already been escalated by husband and mom.\n\n\\*She cleans up, picks up our clothes and does our laundry every day, cooks us meals, sleeps over and does the night shift so we can sleep, and will pretty much do anything we need from her.\n\n\\*he called me ungrateful and basically said that I have to accept her being over all the time if I want her help.\n\n\\***Then they both** guilted me and made me feel ungrateful because I don\u2019t want her in my space because she\u2019s doing everything for us.\n\n\\*And his mom is also guilting me basically **saying she has to help us so he can study**, and it makes me feel like if I reject her help it makes me selfish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMIL has set up the scenario in which OP is selfish if she expects her husband to do something that reduces his study time even though he is just as responsible for this baby and their household.  The things that she are doing are literally OP and Husband responsibilities, but if OP cannot do them and it should fall to husband to do them as the other half of the adults in their household, then that's where his mommy comes in.  The thing is that this is a time where the couple establishes the balance of responsibility, the new normal level of cleanliness vs. chaos within their home, and bonds together.  I'm sure there are a ton of things that MIL is doing that do not actually \\*need\\* to be done -- the example list given contains two ridiculous things:\n\n\\*three adults sleeping in a studio to wake up for a single baby is ridiculous\n\n\\*daily laundry?  Yes, with a baby that stuff piles up, but that's ridiculous to take away and bring back laundry every day.  That's an excuse to come over every day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I were OP, it would be a lot easier for me if Husband and MIL left until finals were over."]}
