His parents (especially my MIL) have been extremely helpful helping with the baby. She cleans up, picks up our clothes and does our laundry every day, cooks us meals, sleeps over and does the night shift so we can sleep, and will pretty much do anything we need from her. \n\nI am grateful for everything she does. The problem is that we live in a studio apartment and having her over all the time makes it really difficult for me. I\u2019m 3 weeks post partum and still figuring out my baby, breastfeeding and pumping. It is extremely hard to do that with my MIL in the studio with us. \n\nDespite this, I let her come over because she\u2019s been extremely helpful. Yesterday though, she did something which I felt was inappropriate. \n\nSh had slept over for 2 nights doing the night shift with the baby and spent 3 days with us. I was so happy when she finally left after 3 days and I could just relax and enjoy my baby. \n\nThen she texted me asking when was a good time to drop off laundry and lunch. I was a bit annoyed because she\u2019d already spent 3 days over and I hadn\u2019t asked for laundry or lunch to be dropped off and I just needed my space for a day. She made sure to write in her text \u201cjust dropping off, not staying.\u201d\n\nThen when she came over, her husband dropped her off and left and she started cleaning up. I was literally in shock that she was staying in our apt, not being invited, and after prefacing that she wasn\u2019t staying. I was visibly upset so she decided to step out and my husband and I got into a huge fight and he called me ungrateful and basically said that I have to accept her being over all the time if I want her help. \n\nThen they both guilted me and made me feel ungrateful because I don\u2019t want her in my space because she\u2019s doing everything for us. \n\nI am extremely grateful for all her help but she is overstaying her welcome and crossing boundaries. \n\nAITA for being overwhelmed by her and getting annoyed with her despite all her help?\n\n\nEDIT: \n\n1. We live in a studio apartment which is 400 square feet so there is literally nowhere else for me to go when his mom is over. \n\n2. my husband is also in graduate school and has his finals now, so I feel guilty when I don\u2019t have his mom help out because it takes away from his studying time and he\u2019s exhausted if he has to stay up with the baby and then will do badly in school. And his mom is also guilting me basically saying she has to help us so he can study, and it makes me feel like if I reject her help it makes me selfish.\n\nAlso for those commenting that my husband isn\u2019t helpful, he actually is extremely helpful, and always bottle feeds the baby and changes diapers.

It stops being help when it\u2019s forced on you. \n\nYou will need to speak up clearly, don\u2019t be vague. \n\n\u201cthank you for offering to drop off the laundry but today doesn\u2019t work for me. Can we see you Xday or Yday instead?\u201d \n\n\u201cI need a few days without company. We will let you know when we\u2019re ready for a visit.  Thank you for understanding.\u201d", "What an amazing MIL. Question, why isn\u2019t your husband doing all those things? What is he doing whilst you are looking after yourself and the baby? Is he working full time? If that\u2019s the case then keep the MIL. All those things she is doing you would end up doing since hubby doesn\u2019t seem capable.", "NTA. No, you don't have to accept her crossing your boundaries and overstaying if you want her help. Your husband is wrong. He needs to be on the same page as you are, and he needs to talk to his mother.\n\nYou might need to set some kind of rule about days on/off and needing an invitation by this point.\n\nEDIT: I also wonder if maybe hubby needs to learn how to do some of these things his mother is doing? I mean, he's also a new father and needs to learn this role.", "NTA. You need privacy and time to bond with your baby, not MIL 24/7. Your husband is absolutely wrong.", "Nta \n\nIs your husband doing anything to help? \n\nI just had a baby and the last thing I wanted was my mother in law at my house daily.", "NTA \n\nI don't think it's out of line for you to ask for some space, even if she is super helpful. It sounds like MIL didn't realize she was bothering you until things had already boiled over, hence why she stepped out before the fight. \n\nI think your husband is being pretty unfair. He can easily step up and help out. He's a grown ass man. His mommy shouldn't be coming over every hour to clean up for him.\n\nYou guys could work out some sort of schedule that everyone agrees on. Like MIL comes over 2 or 3 times a week?", "NTA - It is good that you MIL wants to do all this for you, however you,  your husband and new baby also need serious bonding time together alone. Your MIL is only trying to do what she can to make things easier, but she is overstaying her welcome a bit. If she came over every 3 days to help pick up the house or laundry that would be more acceptable at least. On the other hand, as each day passes, there is no reason for you not to be able to get all this done on your own while the baby sleeps, unless you have more than one child. That would give her less reasons to be needed and overstay her welcome.", "I will say you are NTA but you need to quit relying on her. If you didn't want her help you and your husband should have been getting up and showing her she wasn't needed for the night shift as an example.", "NTA. You have more of a husband problem than a MIL problem, you have boundaries, your MIL seem to at least sensed your boundaries by saying \"just dropping off, not staying\". Your husband however is comfortable with mama doing all the work around the house and ignored your boundaries. I'd start talking to him about splitting chores around the house so when MIL offer her help you can say \"We've already got it done, thank you for all your help\"", "If the help is mandatory and you're not allowed to say no to it, it's not really help. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHas your MIL always been this helpful with her controlling ways?  It sounds like your husband thinks this is fine and unfortunately this is his normal and he's watched it for years.  Things like this tend to get worse after you have a child.\n\nYou need  boundaries.. but if your husband isn't on your side, he is against you.  And they are hard to hold.  I would lock myself in the bedroom with the baby and just feed and sleep.  Husband can stay in the spare room with the MIL.\n\nWhat if you said to him that you are happy not to accept her help at all if she won't leave you alone.\n\nWhere's your family?  Can you go and stay with them for a week or three?  Or a close friend.  This is no different to your MIL staying with you.. both are family , one doesn't trump the other. If your MIL or husband think it's a problem... then you actually have bigger problems than you realised.", "ESH. If she got your drift that you were a little miffed with her unexpected, and certainly unannounced plans to stay, then she\u2019s working real hard to blow right past you on what you want. Yes it\u2019s great that she\u2019s helping and I\u2019m sure you do appreciate it. But you also have to walk a fine line with biting the hand that feeds you. You\u2019re only three weeks postpartum so nerves are frazzled and you do get a pass on that. I\u2019m just saying you have to be careful about the way you approach this, but you\u2019re not truly an asshole here, I\u2019m just saying you have to look at it from her and your possibly slacker husband\u2018s point of view.   All they see and focus on his how much she\u2019s doing and now you look ungrateful. Again I don\u2019t think for one second you\u2019re an asshole I would be way way way more tired of this by now than you are. I had no one to come help and I managed everything just fine, maybe you need to start trying overnights like other people often do also.\n\nAlso really interested in what your husband does around the house. The three of you should sit down together and talk about everything that\u2019s been going on. Remind her first and foremost how much you appreciate her help and truly love her, presuming you do. Discuss in detail this particular incident, and remind her she explicitly stated just to drop off. Then suddenly she\u2019s staying without any word of explanation.  It is very reasonable to be unpleasantly surprised by that, considering she had just stayed the previous three entire days.", "NAH I think your MIL is incredibly kind to help you out so much in such a difficult time. but I think it's also clear that you're grateful for it. you are allowed to want some privacy and alone time.\n\nI think it would be good to discuss openly and directly what kind of help you'd like from her and the boundaries you want to set. if your husband continues to be unreasonable, he's welcome to do all the tasks your MIL is doing. you deserve to rest during your recovery!", "MIL needs to stay home.  You can handle your baby yourself.", "NTA", "You don\u2019t need her to do anything for you except hold the baby when you visit her at her house. Start adulting. You and your partner do everything yourselves and tell her to stay home.\n\nESH", "You and your husband both need to learn to have proper communication.\nYou'd give you both a pass as you are new parents and it could be overwhelming.\nStop this fight and make up.\n\nHowever say some nice and appreciate words to your MIL, she's an angel.\n\nI get you need some time for yourself but pls convey it in a polite manner.\n\nNAH", "YTA- so you want the free maid service but are annoyed when she overstays her welcome? Why is your husband not helping more, and if you\u2019re MIL is doing all that work, what on earth are you two doing?", "NTA your MIL should give you some space to get used to being a mum/ looking after your own baby.", "NTA. But don't expect or ask for any help. You can learn these things on your own, and to prioritize your time. Most babies sleep 20+ hours a day at this stage. This is the easy stage lol. Just tell her you appreciate it, and you're set from here to take over, & \"we'll see you in a week or two when we come to visit\" so she gets the hint.", "ESH. Your husband needs to do better. And I get where you are coming from COMPLETELY but I\u2019m gonna be 100% honest with you. You are incredibly fortunate to have such a caring MIL. I had postpartum pain for weeks longer than usual because I could not sit still to rest. I understand the privacy thing as all I had for a door at the time was a fabric hung on command hooks and I lived with my entire family. I\u2019d recommend you ask politely for a week or so without visiting so your new little family can have some time alone for bonding. I stress politely because odds are in the matter of that week you\u2019ll probably be asking her to come back fr fr. Everything she\u2019s doing is what your husband should be doing- you won\u2019t have anymore peace without her there because he\u2019ll likely refuse to pick up the slack her absence leaves. One thing you\u2019ll learn in this parenting journey is (1) it does take a village and (2) that help won\u2019t always be so forthcoming so cherish it while you have it.

Is it possible for you all to go stay at your in-laws so everyone has more space?... assuming they have a house or larger apartment.", "its amazing how she is so willing to help. but you also have right to say no and not want her around for a while. you need to be able to adjust what looking after a baby alone is like and figure things out, like the night shift, breastfeeding etc especially given that it seems as though your husband isn't doing really any parenting. your husband is being selfish by only thinking about what he wants and not what you need.", "I think OP needs to decide whether they need the help or not. You can't say 'I don't want the laundry to be dropped off today'. You can say 'I appreciate the help but don't need you doing my laundry, and I need some space and alone time with the baby.' \n\nThose are different. The first one means 'do my chores when I say so', and it's an asshole move. Not saying that OP is there, but she's described what her MIL does as... Basically everything.

If MIL comes to help so she can spend as much time as possible around the family but doesn't want to do as much if she's just allowed in to do chores and then must leave immediately that's fair enough.\n\nThat said obviously OP could choose to do more by herself and husband should definitely help with that.", "They are all wrong.

Otherwise don't bother with acting like you actually want to offer them the help they need.", "No, I'm sorry, but you can absolutely say not today please about people being in your own home, whoever they are. The MIL clearly understands this better than the husband because she recognised that actually it wasn't a great time to be over and she probably should have stuck to what she said. Nowhere in this has the MIL come back and said anything about the situation. She's given the space that was needed at that time.\n\nWhen you have a new baby, hormones are all over the shop, as helpful as someone doing all the chores may be on the surface, sometimes you need to be able to just settle in to being a new parent. Especially in a tiny flat. Having your MIL in your face when you have your boobs out every couple of hours feeding or pumping is not a comfortable situation for anyone.

Please show your husband these replies and hopefully he will see sense.", "NTA. Be clear but kind. My MIL came over every day when I had my 1st baby. I had 12 weeks of maternity leave, and I only had 5 days (not consecutive) without her there. She drove me CRAZY. My husband said, \"She is just excited,\" to which I screamed, \" I am just exhausted! Tell her to back off, or I will!\" So, my next two kids, I allowed hospital visits, then a month at home with no visitors, and after the month, Every time MIL invited her self over, or just dropped by unannounced, we said now is not a good time and didnt allow her in. We got visits down to once a week. Now we live a plane ride or 20 hour drive away. My husband even admitted later MIL was driving him crazy and was happy we made and enforced our boundary. He is even happier we live too far for the \"surprise visits\"", "NTA. Your body is healing and you need time to adjust. Even if you appreciate the help, there is A LOT going on with your body that you aren\u2019t familiar with (I\u2019m trained as a post partum doula).

Mil seems incredibly helpful, but you also sound overwhelmed and needing some space. You're still figuring this all out and haven't had much time to just be you and baby. You need to say what you're feeling. She can't know a.boundary if You haven't given her one. You need to let her know you want to try doing it yourself, because mil can't be around all the time and how will you learn if she's always doing everything for you? It's helpful at the start but it's not some thing that can go on forever", "A soft YTA, but only because you\u2019re a very new mom and your emotions and hormones are doing cartwheels. You want your MILs help. You enjoy her help. She even takes nightshifts so you and husband can sleep. She does many, many nice things for you and your husband, she really goes far beyond what is normal. But you\u2019re annoyed with her being around? Well, then you have no help. Your husband will have to step up, as will you. Are you sure you want that and are ready for that? Cause if I was your MIL, you and husband could now 100% take care of that baby yourselves.", "NAH but you're going to realize pretty soon how awesome she is when she stops covering the nightshift (which apparently your husband can't do due to school), your home becomes a mess from limited cleaning, and you realize that someone needs to start cooking food. You can want her gone but if you're struggling now I imagine that you're going to start struggling a lot more when you have all those tasks to do and an irritable husband (either from grouchiness over the situation, school stress, and now increased baby work stress, the last of which was bound to happen eventually). \n\nP.S. Congrats and good luck!", "YTA, just talk to her and say you need some space, but were happy for all the help so far.  \nIf you don't say anything nobody will know...  \n\nDoesn't anyone in this sub know how to use their words anymore??", "I don't think anyone is the AH here. \n\nYou're going though a huge thing, full of hormones, recovering from a massive medical experience, learning how to navigate being a mother and having to deal with a new born. It's all change in all your lives. \n\nYour MIL is obviously being a wonderful help and supporting you in many ways. It sounds like she's going above and beyond. \n\nI think the important thing here is to communicate. Tell her you're unbelievably grateful for her help but you're finding everything overwhelming, especially having 4 people in such a small space. Just tell her you need a bit of time alone and work out the best solution to for everyone's needs. \n\nI appreciate your husband is studying right now, but life changes with a newborn and he's going to have to get used to that. His mother can't help you out forever. \n\nDoes MIL have a larger house? Maybe you could spend a few nights at hers with your own room to be able to get a bit of private space but still have the help? \n\nI don't think anyone is in the wrong here and I'm sure you're utterly overwhelmed and exhausted. The best course of action is to talk about it reasonably with all parties and work out a solution. You're allowed to want a bit of space to yourself, that's not being ungrateful, it's not an all or nothing situation. But the way you explain your needs is also important. Your husband needs to listen to what you need right now and help you out.", "Nta. That woman will never leave you alone. Good luck with your husband/mommy wedding and life.", "What are you doing while she is doing everything? Tell her you are now a mum, and you have to do the mum things and housekeeping, or you won't learn to do it. It is 3 weeks, you should be doing everything without her help. Yta, tell her straight, to be a nanny and not a house cleaner, cook, laundry person, etc.", "NTA. You have the right to feel comfortable in your own home. It's not being ungrateful to want some boundaries and privacy. Your MIL is very very kind for helping so much be she still has to respect YOUR home.\n\nThe only thing you might be a tiny AH for is not communicating your feelings earlier. It's never a good idea to bottle up your frustration because you just end up exploding (which kinda happened here) and look ungrateful. But your husband's response is BS. Of course accepting her help doesn't mean she has to be over ALL THE TIME.", "NTA, however, you need to talk to your MIL. The need for help and the need for quite healing are incompatible with company in 400 sq feet. Hormones and exhaustion make a terrible brew. Please let her know how much you appreciate the help but you really need time for a peaceful recovery too. Maybe come up with a plan \ud83e\udd14 \nHolding your tongue until you snapped is not the same as setting boundaries, and MIL really had no way to read minds. Just talk to her, honestly. Set up boundaries and expectations for both of you.", "Well, this is a lot.\n\nAs an introvert, I am proud of you for keeping your feelings hidden for 3 whole weeks. Bravo. I'd have had no family left by the end of 3 weeks, because I'd have run away with my baby.\n\nHelp is excellent and you want grandparents to love on & bond to their grandchildren, too. Extended families are important. \n\nBut your MIL is focusing her help on her son. Not you. Not the baby.  They have both told you he needs to focus on finals & school.  Finals aren't 3 fucking weeks long and, if it takes that long for him to prep, how dumb is he?  Has he been paying any attention to schoolwork before now? He knew a baby was coming.\n\nI'm going to guess MIL is very traditional and has always enabled your husband's sense of male privilege. I'm also guessing he might not have been terribly helpful during the pregnancy, if you needed anything. Same reason. Focus on school. On success. He shouldn't have to do \"womanly\" things that distract him from his goals. That's what Mommy (and you) are for. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI don't think you're changing either of these people anytime soon.\n\nIf you are okay with handling the new baby & everything your MIL is doing, I'd ask for some space & bonding time with your immediate family.  You need a break from extra people in your tiny space. If you need the help, I'd apologize & take up meditation or something.\n\nDon't have more kids with this giant baby who needs his mommy to do his parenting for him until you see whether he snaps out of it eventually. A couple years between kids should do it.\n\nAlso, don't sideline YOUR career prospects for too long. If MIL wants to be sure her giant baby boy isn't inconvenienced, she can help defray daycare costs.\n\nOfc, all this is not the actual baby's fault.  Babies can be (and often are) utterly wonderful. Breastfeeding that goes well is so peaceful and blissful. The bonds created between mother and child during that time are magical; and help you through those pesky toddler years. \ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA, but you may need to suck it up and put up with a couple AHs for a bit. Focus on your physical health and your beautiful baby. \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta. You're not being ungrateful but perhaps you can communicate better with both of them. \"I love you and I am extremely grateful for your help, but I need space sometimes so I can have peace and quiet to heal and bond with my baby. I'm not asking, I'm telling. Let's work out a schedule that works well for all of us\"", "NTA\n\nYou need both privacy and bonding with the baby. Husband is the one who needs to be setting boundaries with his mom.\n\nMIL ignored your request not to stay, set boundaries. She loses drop off privileges. You are not being ungrateful; you are being ignored by MIL. She is not being helpful when she is doing this because she is creating a negative environment for you. At this point, I would say you don't want her help just to get her to stop.\n\nIf Husband doesn't like it, he needs to be the one setting boundaries with mom to avoid future confrontations. He can deal with the baby and studying if he can't even set a single boundary. He's a dad now; he's gonna be tired whether he likes it or not. Sleep goes before chores go. That's the reality of having a newborn", "NTA\n\nYou are just overwhelmed. They are both trying to help but sometimes that's hard to accept.\n\nJust be honest: you do appreciate and are grateful but it's hard right now and you need a little more space than you can get - in any other circumstance you would love to have her there as much but the one room factor is just a lot. \n\nBe sure to tell them you wish you didn't feel this way bc you are so grateful but you just can't control your feelings right now and need a LITTLE space to try and balance out and adapt", "NTA. Maybe your husband should step up in his mom\u2019s absence. He can\u2019t make you uncomfortable just because he is enjoying the lack of responsibility on his part.", "You're just 3 weeks into postpartum, crazy hormone level changes, body changing, mood swings. You're overwhelmed, your husband is overwhelmed, your MIL knows that and wants to help as much as possible because she thinks that helping is more important than your privacy. \nAnd you do, actually need her help more, you don't realize it now, but when she stops helping you'll understand. Be very respectful when talking to MIL, let her know how much you appreciate her help, but tell her that you want her to rest too, not \"I don't want you to drop off my laundry today, do it other day\" because it's demanding, so just be softer and explain to her that you NEED alone time with the baby to bond with them and you eant your MIL to rest.\n\nAnd I think she stayed that day because your husband told her to, seems more like a husband problem, tell him about everything people go through in postpartum period, let him know how much you need alone time with the baby and with your changing body especially. Tell him that he was TA when he called you ungrateful and in the future when you refer to not wanting your MIL to help as you wanting her to rest everyone will take it easier and won't think you're ungrateful.", "NTA it\u2019s not \u2018help\u2019 if you didn\u2019t get a choice, then it\u2019s just an invasion of your home and a trampling of your feelings and privacy.", "NTA\n\nNice she is helping, but you set boundaries and she has to follow through. Can you go somewhere else? Family?", "NTA the apartment is too small", "NTA  you need to sit down with her and make a schedule.  A firm schedule. You need to be clear about this.", "Info: have you actually communicated to your MIL that you want to do these things on your own? Because it sounds like you're happy for her to do all these things for you and then disappear. Which seems a bit harsh. You can absolutely set boundaries but then you won't have all the help. Maybe ask her for every other day etc. But figure out what you want and then ask for it.", "NTA\n\nYou 100% did the right thing by having your husband be the one to talk to her. He should have been a mediator. Post partum hormones are no joke.\n\nSince your husband dropped the ball, please sit down with your mother in law and ask her to work with you to set up a schedule. Please let her know how much you appreciate her help.\n\nYou need to be able to get into your groove.\n\nOne amazing thing, too many new mommies have to ask for this kind of help and are too afraid to or don't get it.\n\nYou do not need to just get used to it. Tell your mother in law what kind of help you need. She needs to honor your boundaries.\n\nI wish I lived near you. I'm a Doula and this is my job. We know not to take being snapped at personally.\n\nTry not to hold this against your husband. He's a new parent too. You do need to call him out for calling you ungrateful. Let him know that it is his job to be the mediator between you and his mother.\n\nYou and your MIL need to talk this through though. Make a list of things you want her help with. Make a schedule for when she can come over.\n\nI'm sorry your husband dropped the ball here. Hopefully he will learn. Her help shouldn't be causing you stress.", "NTA. The key is to communicating calmly, firmly, and politely. Your feelings are understandable and as a mother herself, your MIL should get this. Perhaps you could work out a schedule? I can't imagine trying to rest with someone fluttering around your confined space. Perhaps she could schedule long walks so you can rest knowing you won't be disturbed by either MIL or baby. Or maybe you could walk the baby while she cleans - and leaves immediately afterwards.", "INFO based on some of the responses people are making it's apparently not clear whether or not you want her there doing those chores or if you actually want for you and your husband to be doing them.  \n\nFor starters-- you and your husband need to step up and start doing all of the overnights yourself-- this would obviate the need for your MIL to be staying overnight.  You and husband can take over the laundry, meals, and cleaning-- maybe let MIL bring over a dinner or two and visit with the baby.   Thank her profusely for her help but explain that the studio is so tiny and you need some alone time to bond with your new baby.", "Exactly. OP needs to communicate her feelings; if not, the MIL may not know that she is intruding. For many people, the level of help that the MIL is providing would be a godsend. For OP, she is too much. Just communicate that (and, TBH, it should 100% be the husband communicating that.) And, even when communicating boundaries, in this case it should be done with some tact, because OP admits the help has been massive and greatly appreciated.\n\nIf this is allowed to silently fester, then this relationship may be damaged and that support won't be there when they want/need it.", "A MIL who shits all over your boundaries is amazing? What?", "Why is the MIL \u2018\u2019doing everything\u2019 \u2018very good\u2019?? The OP and her husband brought the child into the world and new parents  take care of their babies and households AND their other children after giving birth without live in help ALL the time. What is the new father doing to help with baby and run the household?\nOP has stated they live in ONE ROOM. She and her husband are fully aware how the MIL operates and boundaries should have been put in place long before baby was born.", "This is valid but so is feeling like she needs space if she NEVER ever gets any in a 400 sq ft apt.", "She had a baby 3 weeks ago. Healing herself and keeping the baby alive should be her only \u201cadulting\u201d responsibility right now.", "it\u2019s normal for grandma to come and stay and help with the new baby\u2026. Sorry you\u2019ve never experienced that type of family bond or community\u2026..", "My mom bent over backwards to help my brother and his fianc\u00e9e after birth...how and when they needed it. You can't impose yourself on others like that.", "OP hasn\u2019t given her any boundaries. It actually sounds like she\u2019s good since she sensed there was an issue and then stepped out to allow the married couple/parents to talk. For all we know husband has asked this of her.", "The problem is there haven't been any boundaries communicated. OP admits that the MIL's help has been extremely helpful and generous - she just needs space. And, that just needs to be voiced. \n\nI don't think there are any AH here.", "Then stop crying to the husband that the MIL is over too much and suck it up. No doubt OP knew how her MIL would act once baby was on the scene. Her bad for not making hubby sit down and set boundaries with his mom prior to baby\u2019s arrival.", "You have no idea what I\u2019ve experienced. What OP is describing going on with MIL is OVER THE TOP. They live in ONE ROOM. Boundaries should have been set prior (they knew how MIL operates)  and if hubby can\u2019t do it/won\u2019t do it, OP needs to do it for the sake of her mental health.", "Would it be an option for maybe you and baby to move in with MIL for a little while? I understand you're feeling smothered because it is such a small space for 3 people and a newborn, but if in laws are in a house could you go stay there for a couple weeks while hubby is doing finals and unable to help himself. That way you are getting the support you need and appreciate but it gives you an option of doing what was said above and just closing yourself away with baby when the feelings get to much.", "You also can't expect help around the house, without the help being in the house?", "The problem is not that OP told MIL don't come around today. The problem is that she is upset MIL is constantly in her flat. But she's grateful that MIL is doing all those things. She's not upset MIL did the laundry, she's upset she brought it at a time inconvenient to her. \n\nShe's counting on MIL to do everything because she's understandably recovering and because her husband is studying, but is annoyed at MIL for being there. She's grateful she can sleep because MIL is in night shift, but she's overwhelmed by her being in the flat. MIL is, indeed, very understanding, but OP is not asking for something realistic. MIL can't do all the things OP is grateful for without being there. \n\nIs perfectly acceptable to ask for space, but it's not fair to MIL to be resentful of her presence when the things they need her to do require her to be there.", "But they didn't tell her it wasn't a good time. OP was annoyed, but she didn't say anything, and when MIL was there and noticed OP was overwhelmed, she left. \n\nShe's doing a shit lot of things for them, things that they know they need and they can't do right now. That is very gracious of MIL, and requires a huge amount of effort on her part too. She's given up her sleep! I think it's unfair to be resentful of her when a)they need the help and b)they haven't told her not to do them.", "My MIL is like hers. When I gave birth last year, we have a toddler so my MIL took it upon herself to have my daughter sleepover with her for a few days so that I could adjust with the new baby. \nAfter a week, I asked my MIL to let my daughter sleep with us cause I miss her already. My MIL said okay but my husband was reluctant. \n\nOP needs to tell her husband her boundaries or at the very least tell her MIL she just needs time to herself and the baby. Of course, preface this by taking her MIL for taking time and effort to help them out.", "I have no doubt OP knows exactly how how her MIL operates. Boundaries should have been put in place long before baby arrived.", "This is wild that you blame her for both her MIL\u2019s lack of boundaries and her husband\u2019s lack of action. OP should have just assumed ahead of time that her MIL would take over her tiny tiny space and that her husband would do nothing? She\u2019s not clairvoyant. But now husband knows it\u2019s a problem, why is it still OP\u2019s responsibility to \u201csuck it up\u201d instead of his job to be a good husband and set boundaries with his own mother?", "If she's overwhelmed by a woman constantly being in her face and not letting her be a mother, how do you think moving in with her mil and losing all ability to care for her child herself feel, to a new mother, not even a month free of ripping a baby through her vaginal canal.\n\nShe might be developing ppd and the people in her life are failing her by putting added stress on her.\n\nMIL needs to back off and let her precious baby grow up and raise his baby instead of letting his mother steamroll his newly split in two wife while she's missing out on the pivotal bonding hours, because mil just wants to help.\n\nMil isn't helping if the mothers mental health is directly impacted by her being up her recently split open vagina.", "My first point she never wanted let alone EXPECTED help", "This should be the top comment.", "That's not what she said though is it? She said it was fine to bring the laundry but MIL said she wasn't staying *and then stayed*. She went directly against what had been arranged. That is MIL overstepping the mark. She wouldn't have had to feel how she felt if MIL did what she said.", "The best solution, maybe MIL can go out or home for lunch or something for a few hours at least. It's not great, but it's a compromise. OP not only are you NTA but you are truly superwoman rn. While you have every right to demand you get the space you need, you are aware enough to know it's not just you. You are still sacrificing for your husband, despite just giving birth. They should be BOWING to you. Just remember though, it's temporary. Finals will be over soon. Make sure there are plans and agreements in place for your husband (and you as you heal and feel better) take over what your MIL is doing, so she's needed less and less.", "She can set boundaries if her husband will not. Have a backbone, be an adult and set boundaries that should have been set before baby arrived. It has nothing to do with being \u2018clairvoyant\u2019 and everything to do with being proactive to head off unnecessary intrusion into their new life as a family of 3. It will only get worse as the child gets older.", "MIL isn't clairvoyant either, nor psychic. How is she supposed to know she is over stepping when no-one has told her she is. All she is doing is helping and taking a huge amount of the strain off OP and the husband, even OP has said this is true", "She said the main reason was the fact they live in a 400 sq foot studio so there is no way to get space so it feels like her MIL is constantly on top of her. That's why I asked if that may be an option as she says she's greatful for all the help but she feels claustrophobic because there is no space. If she were able to be in a larger home where help if asked for and needed was easily available then but she could still have her time and space with baby.", "Did she actually say she never wanted help? From her edits, it sounded like she wanted and needed help, just that she was expecting it from her husband, whom she also said is unable to help just yet as he is currently having his finals.\n\nYour second point also mentioned that a woman who just gave birth should have help with housework and the baby. So who then, should be providing the help? And how is that not an expectation of help?", "OP didn't tell MIL 'you can just come and drop it and go', MIL said it. Maybe she planned to, and then saw the house was a mess (undertandable again with a newborn) and started to pick. In fact, maybe she had other plans that she abandoned because her son and DIL have been so dependent on her that she decided to stay and clean. Or maybe she is a busybody with nothing else to do, who knows. But the moment she saw OP was upset, she left. She realised she had overstepped the mark and corrected the situation. It doesn't sound like OP had set the boundary, she had just gotten annoyed at her MIL 's help not coming at the right time, but didn't communicate that until the explosive fight with her husband. \n\nAgain, if OP doesn't want her in the studio, that's fair. But she has to tell her that, and she has to then acknowledge that she won't have the help that they have had so far.", "Overall, she just had a baby. It's not like she wasn't appreciative of the help MIL was giving, but sometimes, as humans, we need space. Especially in such a personal time of just having had a baby. MIL needs to respect boundaries, and if that means that she doesn't wanna help anymore, then OP can't get mad at that either"]}
