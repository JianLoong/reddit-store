His parents (especially my MIL) have been extremely helpful helping with the baby. She cleans up, picks up our clothes and does our laundry every day, cooks us meals, sleeps over and does the night shift so we can sleep, and will pretty much do anything we need from her. \n\nI am grateful for everything she does. The problem is that we live in a studio apartment and having her over all the time makes it really difficult for me. I\u2019m 3 weeks post partum and still figuring out my baby, breastfeeding and pumping. It is extremely hard to do that with my MIL in the studio with us. \n\nDespite this, I let her come over because she\u2019s been extremely helpful. Yesterday though, she did something which I felt was inappropriate. \n\nSh had slept over for 2 nights doing the night shift with the baby and spent 3 days with us. I was so happy when she finally left after 3 days and I could just relax and enjoy my baby. \n\nThen she texted me asking when was a good time to drop off laundry and lunch. I was a bit annoyed because she\u2019d already spent 3 days over and I hadn\u2019t asked for laundry or lunch to be dropped off and I just needed my space for a day. She made sure to write in her text \u201cjust dropping off, not staying.\u201d\n\nThen when she came over, her husband dropped her off and left and she started cleaning up. I was literally in shock that she was staying in our apt, not being invited, and after prefacing that she wasn\u2019t staying. I was visibly upset so she decided to step out and my husband and I got into a huge fight and he called me ungrateful and basically said that I have to accept her being over all the time if I want her help. \n\nThen they both guilted me and made me feel ungrateful because I don\u2019t want her in my space because she\u2019s doing everything for us. \n\nI am extremely grateful for all her help but she is overstaying her welcome and crossing boundaries. \n\nAITA for being overwhelmed by her and getting annoyed with her despite all her help?\n\n\nEDIT: \n\n1. We live in a studio apartment which is 400 square feet so there is literally nowhere else for me to go when his mom is over. \n\n2. my husband is also in graduate school and has his finals now, so I feel guilty when I don\u2019t have his mom help out because it takes away from his studying time and he\u2019s exhausted if he has to stay up with the baby and then will do badly in school. And his mom is also guilting me basically saying she has to help us so he can study, and it makes me feel like if I reject her help it makes me selfish.", "created_utc": 1685610455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xclou/aita_for_crying_to_my_husband_about_my_mil_coming/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It stops being help when it\u2019s forced on you. \n\nYou will need to speak up clearly, don\u2019t be vague. \n\n\u201cthank you for offering to drop off the laundry but today doesn\u2019t work for me. Can we see you Xday or Yday instead?\u201d \n\n\u201cI need a few days without company. We will let you know when we\u2019re ready for a visit.  Thank you for understanding.\u201d", "What an amazing MIL. Question, why isn\u2019t your husband doing all those things? What is he doing whilst you are looking after yourself and the baby? Is he working full time? If that\u2019s the case then keep the MIL. All those things she is doing you would end up doing since hubby doesn\u2019t seem capable.", "NTA. No, you don't have to accept her crossing your boundaries and overstaying if you want her help. Your husband is wrong. He needs to be on the same page as you are, and he needs to talk to his mother.\n\nYou might need to set some kind of rule about days on/off and needing an invitation by this point.\n\nEDIT: I also wonder if maybe hubby needs to learn how to do some of these things his mother is doing? I mean, he's also a new father and needs to learn this role.", "NTA. You need privacy and time to bond with your baby, not MIL 24/7. Your husband is absolutely wrong.", "Nta \n\nIs your husband doing anything to help? \n\nI just had a baby and the last thing I wanted was my mother in law at my house daily.", "NTA \n\nI don't think it's out of line for you to ask for some space, even if she is super helpful. It sounds like MIL didn't realize she was bothering you until things had already boiled over, hence why she stepped out before the fight. \n\nI think your husband is being pretty unfair. He can easily step up and help out. He's a grown ass man. His mommy shouldn't be coming over every hour to clean up for him.\n\nYou guys could work out some sort of schedule that everyone agrees on. Like MIL comes over 2 or 3 times a week?", "NTA - It is good that you MIL wants to do all this for you, however you,  your husband and new baby also need serious bonding time together alone. Your MIL is only trying to do what she can to make things easier, but she is overstaying her welcome a bit. If she came over every 3 days to help pick up the house or laundry that would be more acceptable at least. On the other hand, as each day passes, there is no reason for you not to be able to get all this done on your own while the baby sleeps, unless you have more than one child. That would give her less reasons to be needed and overstay her welcome.", "I will say you are NTA but you need to quit relying on her. If you didn't want her help you and your husband should have been getting up and showing her she wasn't needed for the night shift as an example.", "NTA. You have more of a husband problem than a MIL problem, you have boundaries, your MIL seem to at least sensed your boundaries by saying \"just dropping off, not staying\". Your husband however is comfortable with mama doing all the work around the house and ignored your boundaries. I'd start talking to him about splitting chores around the house so when MIL offer her help you can say \"We've already got it done, thank you for all your help\"", "If the help is mandatory and you're not allowed to say no to it, it's not really help. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHas your MIL always been this helpful with her controlling ways?  It sounds like your husband thinks this is fine and unfortunately this is his normal and he's watched it for years.  Things like this tend to get worse after you have a child.\n\nYou need  boundaries.. but if your husband isn't on your side, he is against you.  And they are hard to hold.  I would lock myself in the bedroom with the baby and just feed and sleep.  Husband can stay in the spare room with the MIL.\n\nWhat if you said to him that you are happy not to accept her help at all if she won't leave you alone.\n\nWhere's your family?  Can you go and stay with them for a week or three?  Or a close friend.  This is no different to your MIL staying with you.. both are family , one doesn't trump the other. If your MIL or husband think it's a problem... then you actually have bigger problems than you realised.", "ESH. If she got your drift that you were a little miffed with her unexpected, and certainly unannounced plans to stay, then she\u2019s working real hard to blow right past you on what you want. Yes it\u2019s great that she\u2019s helping and I\u2019m sure you do appreciate it. But you also have to walk a fine line with biting the hand that feeds you. You\u2019re only three weeks postpartum so nerves are frazzled and you do get a pass on that. I\u2019m just saying you have to be careful about the way you approach this, but you\u2019re not truly an asshole here, I\u2019m just saying you have to look at it from her and your possibly slacker husband\u2018s point of view.   All they see and focus on his how much she\u2019s doing and now you look ungrateful. Again I don\u2019t think for one second you\u2019re an asshole I would be way way way more tired of this by now than you are. I had no one to come help and I managed everything just fine, maybe you need to start trying overnights like other people often do also.\n\nAlso really interested in what your husband does around the house. The three of you should sit down together and talk about everything that\u2019s been going on. Remind her first and foremost how much you appreciate her help and truly love her, presuming you do. Discuss in detail this particular incident, and remind her she explicitly stated just to drop off. Then suddenly she\u2019s staying without any word of explanation.  It is very reasonable to be unpleasantly surprised by that, considering she had just stayed the previous three entire days.", "NAH I think your MIL is incredibly kind to help you out so much in such a difficult time. but I think it's also clear that you're grateful for it. you are allowed to want some privacy and alone time.\n\nI think it would be good to discuss openly and directly what kind of help you'd like from her and the boundaries you want to set. if your husband continues to be unreasonable, he's welcome to do all the tasks your MIL is doing. you deserve to rest during your recovery!", "MIL needs to stay home.  You can handle your baby yourself.", "NTA", "You don\u2019t need her to do anything for you except hold the baby when you visit her at her house. Start adulting. You and your partner do everything yourselves and tell her to stay home.\n\nESH", "You and your husband both need to learn to have proper communication.\nYou'd give you both a pass as you are new parents and it could be overwhelming.\nStop this fight and make up.\n\nHowever say some nice and appreciate words to your MIL, she's an angel.\n\nI get you need some time for yourself but pls convey it in a polite manner.\n\nNAH", "YTA- so you want the free maid service but are annoyed when she overstays her welcome? Why is your husband not helping more, and if you\u2019re MIL is doing all that work, what on earth are you two doing?", "NTA your MIL should give you some space to get used to being a mum/ looking after your own baby.", "NTA. But don't expect or ask for any help. You can learn these things on your own, and to prioritize your time. Most babies sleep 20+ hours a day at this stage. This is the easy stage lol. Just tell her you appreciate it, and you're set from here to take over, & \"we'll see you in a week or two when we come to visit\" so she gets the hint.", "ESH. Your husband needs to do better. And I get where you are coming from COMPLETELY but I\u2019m gonna be 100% honest with you. You are incredibly fortunate to have such a caring MIL. I had postpartum pain for weeks longer than usual because I could not sit still to rest. I understand the privacy thing as all I had for a door at the time was a fabric hung on command hooks and I lived with my entire family. I\u2019d recommend you ask politely for a week or so without visiting so your new little family can have some time alone for bonding. I stress politely because odds are in the matter of that week you\u2019ll probably be asking her to come back fr fr. Everything she\u2019s doing is what your husband should be doing- you won\u2019t have anymore peace without her there because he\u2019ll likely refuse to pick up the slack her absence leaves. One thing you\u2019ll learn in this parenting journey is (1) it does take a village and (2) that help won\u2019t always be so forthcoming so cherish it while you have it.

(That she's crashing at your small place has to be suffocating.) NTA.", "NAH. Is it possible for you all to go stay at your in-laws so everyone has more space?... assuming they have a house or larger apartment.", "its amazing how she is so willing to help. but you also have right to say no and not want her around for a while. you need to be able to adjust what looking after a baby alone is like and figure things out, like the night shift, breastfeeding etc especially given that it seems as though your husband isn't doing really any parenting. your husband is being selfish by only thinking about what he wants and not what you need.", "I think OP needs to decide whether they need the help or not. You can't say 'I don't want the laundry to be dropped off today'. You can say 'I appreciate the help but don't need you doing my laundry, and I need some space and alone time with the baby.' \n\nThose are different. The first one means 'do my chores when I say so', and it's an asshole move. Not saying that OP is there, but she's described what her MIL does as... Basically everything. And they're grateful, and speak about it as what they need. \n\n>She cleans up, picks up our clothes and does our laundry every day, cooks us meals, sleeps over and does the night shift so we can sleep, and will pretty much do anything we need from her.\n\nIf they are going to start doing all of that, by all means, tell MIL 'thanks, but we got this'. But they can't expect her to do all of that while being invisible to them on their studio flat.", ">No, you don't have to accept her crossing your boundaries and overstaying if you want her help.\n\nI mean kind of. Like she's not a helper robot or paid maid. If MIL comes to help so she can spend as much time as possible around the family but doesn't want to do as much if she's just allowed in to do chores and then must leave immediately that's fair enough.\n\nThat said obviously OP could choose to do more by herself and husband should definitely help with that.", "They are all wrong. Having your MIL sleep over 3 days to do night duty?? \n\nESH", "We live in a studio apartment so there\u2019s no other rooms to go into which is part of the problem!", "1. I don't think she ever said that she wants the MIL to do everything around the house.\n2. They're taking care of mom and baby. You can't expect a woman who just gave birth to be doing all the housework and taking care of herself and the baby, it's just not reasonable", "Ditto", "Take charge of your baby and your life and start adulting. And get that husband of yours on board. \n\nESH", "If you care about being helpful to someone, then you need to do what's helpful for them, not what *you* think is helpful. So yeah, if someone says that today isn't a good day for you to drop off their laundry, then if you care about actually being helpful, you should accommodate that. Otherwise don't bother with acting like you actually want to offer them the help they need.", "No, I'm sorry, but you can absolutely say not today please about people being in your own home, whoever they are. The MIL clearly understands this better than the husband because she recognised that actually it wasn't a great time to be over and she probably should have stuck to what she said. Nowhere in this has the MIL come back and said anything about the situation. She's given the space that was needed at that time.\n\nWhen you have a new baby, hormones are all over the shop, as helpful as someone doing all the chores may be on the surface, sometimes you need to be able to just settle in to being a new parent. Especially in a tiny flat. Having your MIL in your face when you have your boobs out every couple of hours feeding or pumping is not a comfortable situation for anyone. I found it hard enough with my own mother!", "How is that ESH? OP didn't ask or expect her to do that."]}
