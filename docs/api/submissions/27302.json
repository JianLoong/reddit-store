I have a 4 year old daughter, June, who I\u2019m raising on my own, her mom gave up custody. My girlfriend, Amber, has a brother, john, who I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s mentally disabled, I figured it\u2019s not my place to ask. John is in his 40s and I honestly thought he was Amber\u2019s dad. From what I understand, he has never moved out, I don\u2019t know where his money comes from, and he hasn\u2019t have a job in maybe 10 years and I know he isn\u2019t dating anyone.The issue that happened was a few days ago when Amber wanted to go out for some drinks. Like I said, I\u2019m not social, so I really didn\u2019t want to go, but John insisted that he\u2019d watch June. I really wasn\u2019t comfortable with this because I didn\u2019t want to put June in a weird situation, I\u2019ve never left her with anyone other than my parents, but Amber kept saying how great John is with kids and he watched her a lot when they were younger.  Reluctantly, I agreed, gave him her overnight bag and the instructions to follow before she goes to bed.We got an uber later and I came back to find June asleep on the tile floor, in a tight ball and drenched in pee, John was in his room with his door locked. I was furious, but I quickly took her into the bathroom to clean and change her. I asked what happened and he told me when we left, she asked for a soda, became high energy and she overwhelmed him, so he left her alone. I distinctly told him she cannot have soda, but he backtracked and said she had it without asking, which I know is a lie because she cannot open the tabs on her own. When I asked if he knew she peed herself, he said yes and gave her a small spank. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to get far with asking any more questions, so I just grabbed June and left. My girlfriend called and asked why I left and I told her that I don\u2019t\u2019 want her brother near my daughter ever again. She said I\u2019m over reacting and her brother is harmless. We went back and forth and she said if I really keep my daughter from him, he\u2019s going to think he did something wrong and he\u2019ll feel bad and I had it and told her that he did do something wrong and he should feel bad. In way meaner terms, she said I\u2019m being a jerk.AITA?\n\nEDIT: Something I wanted to add. Like I said, I'm not a social guy and I like to stay home. My daughter has only stayed alone with my parents and my sister on occasion, other than that we're both usually together. The other night (this all happened on Saturday night) Amber really wanted to get some drinks and see some local band she knows. I really didn't want to, because we originally said we were going to have a movie night, but she begged and pleaded. That's why I reluctantly agreed. We were gone maybe 2 hours. I know it doesn't make it better, but it's just a bit of clarification.", "created_utc": 1695276466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16o83xs/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_i_dont_want/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know what issues he may have going on under the surface, but that's the only sensible reason I can think of, other than him just being selfish.", "I didn't want to delve into that territory because I know this subreddit is picky about anything regarding relationships. It's sinking and I'm okay with that.", "I\u2019m with you. Terrible to not vet this man and just leave her there. And the baby is covered in urine and he\u2019s arguing back and forth with the girlfriend instead of going nuclear and perhaps doing check ups to make sure she\u2019s really ok Medically/general health wise? Wild \ud83e\udee0", "These are fair points, thank you.", ">(and you should be so thankful it wasn\u2019t worse!),\n\nThis. The description alone gave me chills. Dude, YTA for this", "I agree, he had my phone number and he knew to message me if he had any questions, nothing the whole night.", "He hit her!! Then left a 4 year old alone? I\u2019d take her to a pediatrician immediately for an exam to make sure he didn\u2019t do worse things as well. And she thinks you are overreacting? You will be the AH if you don\u2019t break up with her immediately. She and her brother are both unsafe.", "And thank goodness John only spanked her & didn't lose it on her .", "We all know why.  We're just not allowed to say it on this subreddit if we don't want to risk getting banned.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like it was a stranger and it seems like he was going off his girlfriends word.", "Basically this.", "If the child came first he wouldn\u2019t leave the child with a totally unknown man for hours and hours.  The child came second to the date already.\n\nThis kid was left with a strange man who insisted on caring for her despite clearly lacking any experience or know-how in childcare and found alone, soaked in urine, and had been hit.  \nFrankly OP should be on his knees thanking whatever gods he may have that his daughter was not used for CSAM while he toddled off for a few drinks.", "We're on a break right now, we never had an issue up until this moment, but I'm more than likely going to end things.", "She's okay. She saw her doctor monday morning and no bruising or anything. I asked her if he touched her and she only mentioned the spank.", "Uh no. I have multiple brothers. And if any of them did something like this to my kid, I would not be looking on the bright side. Which is what, btw? That he didn\u2019t physically abuse her? Just neglected her a little?\n\nHow the duck do you not ask if someone is mentally disabled before leaving your kid with them? Geez Louise.", "Maybe it's just law&order svu in me talking right now. But did you have your daughter evaluated by a medical professional? Also, if your gf is going to keep defending herbrother, aren't you afraid she will make a way for him to be alone with your daughter again? \n\nNTA", "She\u2019s probably avoiding admitting to herself she was subjected to the same treatment when he watched her when she was young.", "The reality is that a grown man over 40 left a 4 year old child by herself because she was energetic (shocking! imagine an energetic child, truly unheard of/s), left her in a puddle of her own pee and 'spanked' her for it as well! He is dangerous, and it's more than alarming you gf doesn't think so. In what world does anyone think 'relax, this is fine'?! Your gf and her brother are dangerous for children, don't have them around children ever", "Dude, he beat your child and then left her alone laying in a puddle of piss. You would be a shit father to stay with someone who doesnt think there is something wrong with that.", "YTA for underreacting and trying to justify him.", "Woah are you kidding? Maybe she peed herself as a defense mechanism. Good grief. YTA. Stay away from both of these people.", "I agree with you on this point and I understand your giving him a chance after learning he watched your gf. It's very sad that it went so far south. It's always easy for people to second guess after the fact.\n\nYou do need to talk to your daughter about what happened to be sure something worse didn't happen. \n\nNTA for the current situation with your gf. She really needs a reality check on right and wrong regarding child supervision. This is definitely a red flag so be glad it came up now before the relationship is too far down the road. This might be be the right time to get out of the relationship.", "As a parent of kids similar ages qthis entire post made my skin crawl. You saw so many red flags but still chose to put your daughter in the care of someone who you questioned their mental capabilities. Shame on you. You\u2019re daughter is lucky that the worst thing that happened to her is wetting herself, which is a typical response to fear/trauma so who knows what happened in your absence but I doubt it was solely related to \u201csoda\u201d since I assume she is potty trained at 4 years old. Again\u2026SHAME ON YOU. Your daughter deserves better. Never bring her to that house again, get her to a therapist and do better.", "And stop doing things you actually don't want to do.

Did you call to check on your daughter? Did you call to check she was OK in the care of a male virtual stranger who you suspect but didn't like to ask if he was mentally disabled?", "And this is the mentally disabled man's fault how?  Take some accountability ffs.", "u/Emotional_Cellist281, please consider this", "I\u2019m glad I finally saw a comment about getting an exam. Unfortunately, I\u2019m assuming the worst in this situation.", "Wdym?", "Why??", "So a stranger..someone he doesn\u2019t know personally.", "No responsible parent leaves their child with an adult they don't know or whose experience with children they haven't checked out.\n\nOP himself says he left his daughter reluctantly, he didn't trust him. He made a mistake and I hope he'll learn to choose his babysitters better, \"trust me bro\" from your girlfriend isn't enough when it comes to your kid's safety.", "Okay, that's good.

Right now, I'm just trying to justify the actions I did take, because all I saw was red and knew I needed to leave.", "And yes. YTA", "She is potty trained, however she still has issues with wetting the bed on occasion. In her overnight bag there was a spare set of clothing and some night time diapers.", "I called an hour in and he said everything was fine and she was sleeping. I didn't question it further. I was home an hour after that call.", "I reached out to him, but he never reached out to me. I'm not a mindreader.", "Hon, someone with that user name doesn't get to feign ignorance here.", "I'm thankful people commented this because unfortunatly, I do understand", "OP your action to leave was good to do. You seemed to be trying to defend the brother hence my comment. Dump this whole toxic mess of gf.", "Did you ask June what happened? Did she tell you the same thing the brother did? You\u2019re daughter was curled up in a ball on the floor after a man she hardly knows supposedly spanked her and left her by herself. There are some serious questions that need to be answered because this whole thing does not sound right just because she drank a soda", "She didn\u2019t wet the bed. She was terrified. You found YOUR 4 year old daughter curled in a ball on the floor in a puddle of her own urine while a 40year old man cowered in his room. Don\u2019t be blind. Prioritize your daughter, Break up with your girlfriend bc she clearly has no concept of the danger her brother presents, and get your daughter to a therapist.", "No.  You're a father who admittedly left your 4yr old daughter in the care of a mentally disabled man you don't know.\n\nDo better.", "wut", "I honestly don't know what to really think of the situation. 99% of me was angry, but 1% had a lot of doubt that maybe the brother wasn't being this way on purpose.", "Sorry, but no. He left his daughter with his gf's brother, who his gf that he trusts (and should trust) vouched for. It's not on OP that apparently his gf's judgement is godawfull, and OP says he is not sure if the brother even is mentally disabled. Other then presumbed lack of mental abillity, there was nothing to be perceived 'wrong' with the brother, and OP could have never known or guessed this could have happened.\n\nShould OP have trusted his instinct? Yes. But his daughter getting abused because he trusted the wrong person is not entirely OP's fault."]}
