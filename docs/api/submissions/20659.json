His brother, Jay, had asked the day before if him and his family (wife + 3 kids) could come over on Sunday to swim after one of the kids\u2019 sports games, which was at a park close by to us.\n\nNow, fianc\u00e9 and I own a business together that requires WFH (work from home) on Sundays. Everyone that we know is aware of this, including his brother. I voiced my opinion that I felt it was weird for people to be at our house while we were working in the basement, but fianc\u00e9 assured that it would just be chill. He said it\u2019s normal for family to use people\u2019s pools even if they weren\u2019t home.\n\nSo, we let them come thinking that they would swim for maybe an hour then leave. But it wasn\u2019t just them. Fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents also came (we figured they would), but the kicker is that Jay also invited 2 of his friends plus their partners and their kids as well. We do know these people but both fianc\u00e9 and I were not aware of this beforehand.\n\nSo now it\u2019s a full on party in our backyard while we are working in the basement. I became very annoyed that they did not only invite themselves but some of their friends as well. It made me feel guilty that I couldn\u2019t be in my own backyard to host people because I was working. It also felt like they were just using the house and didn\u2019t really care about seeing us, the homeowners. Not to mention, the house was a complete mess. We had a busy Friday and Saturday and I didn\u2019t bother cleaning much before because I figured it would just be Jay\u2019s family. \n\nEveryone was here from 1:00 PM til 7:00 PM. We finished work around 3:00 PM, at which time fianc\u00e9 put on his swim trunks to join them outside. I got in a pretty bitter mood from it all and stayed inside. I didn\u2019t say hello to anyone cause I figured they weren\u2019t even here to see me, just my pool. I did some laundry and some cleaning up and I did end up seeing a few people who were coming inside to use the washrooms. I said hi and tried to make some small talk but I really wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nFianc\u00e9 came in and said that I was creating an awkward/unwelcoming atmosphere by not being outside. I told him I never planned to have a party today so I was just carrying on doing what I originally had planned which was laundry and cleaning.\n\nFianc\u00e9 keeps saying that I was rude for not joining them outside after work. He also says things like \u201cthe pool is meant to be used\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s family time\u201d.

I hope you\u2019re prepared for unexpected and unwanted guests for the rest of your life. Your fianc\u00e9 clearly thinks your home is a community center, and you clearly think it is a private place. Neither approach is \u201cwrong\u201d but they are entirely incompatible.", "NTA - it is rude to invite people to someone else\u2019s house without clearing it with the owners first. Your fianc\u00e9 obviously didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, but you two need to iron that out soon, because it doesn\u2019t sound like this will be a one time occurrence.", "NTA.\n\nThey invited themselves over to YOUR property, with no consideration of giving advanced notice of the extra people. They're treating your space like theirs and that's not right. \n\nSet some clear boundaries and tell them when they can or cannot come to the pool, and establish the rule that they need to ask for permission/give heads up before they invite anyone else.\n\nThe only rude people are Jay and his wife. And your fiance's not very helpful either.", "NTA...Your fianc\u00e9 disregarded your feelings on this from the beginning.  Now you are known as the house with the free pool.  You need to nip this in the bud right away or your home and garden will be overrun all summer.", "NTA\n\nI mean who invites people to someone else's house without as much as asking ? And since your partner accepted it just like that, you can see a glimpse of your future. So there may be people who are fine with this kind of thing, but you are obviously not it, so if you are not prepared mentally for this kind of crap all the time,please try some stern talking/counseling about boundaries ,and if your future husband still does not understand that it is also your private space , then I would re-evaluate thewedding maybe ?", "NTA Nope, nope, nope. I understand that feeling of being invaded, boundaries stomped, exploited and the lack of control; it feels horrible. Years back I took a nap on.a Sunday afternoon & woke up to neighbors in my kitchen prepping & announcing that they were hosting a barbeque at my house ( with a lot of my food) that my husband had agreed to. They invited some other people. WOW! I wish I'd simply kicked them out, but I felt so much confusion since husband  had apparently agreed. It was hard to even be agreeable.  Never again!", "NTA - this is shitty behaviour all around.\nYou dont invite other people to a house you dont live in.\n\nYour fiance is an AH too, for allowing this BS", "NTA\n\nFirst off, anything that happens in your pool, you are liable for, and comes out of your homeowners insurance\n\nSecondly, even though it was pretty clear that only those who people were allowed, you should\u2019ve made it even more clear as people showed up, that, unfortunately the invite/accepted invitation was for those few people.\n\nEspecially these days, everybody wants to sue somebody for something, Always think liability, liability, liability.", "NTA. This would annoy the hell out of me too. Especially being expected to be social after work. You and your fianc\u00e9 need to have a talk about family boundaries before you get married.", "NTA - It appears that you and your fiance have different views on pool guests, which is a cause for concern. BUT, your guests (his bro and family) are completely rude for asking other people to join them for a pool party at your house without your permission. They are either clueless or really selfish. In addition, if someone got hurt, you would probably have some liability (you should definitely check this).", "NTA. I agree that it it unacceptable for your family to have invited their friends without asking first. I also think that your fianc\u00e9 should have backed you up when they were overstaying/invited more people, but he seemed more interested in hanging with friends then backing you up. I would sit down with your husbands and voice your concerns and then set more clearer boundaries with your husband's brother. I think it should be okay for him and the family to use your pool occasionally though as long as he isn't bringing over a whole party every-time and doesn't overstay", "NTA and weird honestly that people would come to someone elses house to have essentially a pool party while they are inside working... and then stay for 6 hours. What the hell? \n\nAlso Fiance should be ashamed they ignored your concerns and feelings.", "NTA\n\nLegally, you are responsible for the safety of the pool.  Having guests in the pool when you can't be there to supervise means that you can't intervene if people are making poor safety decisions, yet if someone gets hurt, you are responsible.  You don't know if these people know how to swim, if they will supervise their kids properly, if anyone has a medical condition that makes swimming unsafe.\n\nAnd your BIL had no business inviting people to your home without discussing it with you first.  And planning it much farther in advance than he did.  \n\nHow much of a mess did they make of your home, adding to the stuff you would have cleaned if you knew guests were coming, but didn't get to clean?  How much of your food did they eat?  How did that impact your plans for the week?\n\nThe cleaning issue is a big one.  Your fiance may have invited his brother. But, the world being what it is, if people are judgmental about the house being messy, it's going to be thrown on you, not him.  If your fiance is inviting people over, it is his job to make sure that the house is suitably clean for guests before they arrive. \n\nYour fiance's brother was family.  The rest of the guests were not. Since you or your fiance didn't invite them, technically, they were trespassing.\n\nYou need to discuss with your fiance that if he invites people over, he needs to make plans with you and discuss it in advance.  And if the people he invites show up with uninvited guests, he needs to step in and have them leave, not encourage your home as a public gathering place for the uninvited.\n\nThe main problem is with your fiance.  He should not have invited his brother without talking to you. If his brother asked, he should have said he needed to talk with you and see if it would work for both of you.  And he needed to be clear to his brother that the invitation was only for him and his family, not a more general invitation to anyone the brother wants.\n\nAlthough I do wonder if your fiance knew your brother would be inviting guests, and just didn't bother to tell you.  Which would be an even bigger problem in regards to your relationship.\n\nYou have a fiance problem.  If he doesn't admit and agree that he was out of line, starting from inviting his brother to your shared home without discussing it with you first, and at every step thereafter, I'd think twice about if you want to live this way, because it won't be a one-time problem.", "NTA. Why is it not rude for people you don\u2019t even know to be invited to your home? That\u2019s ridiculous", "NTA you need some serious boundaries with your fianc\u00e9 and his family. If you are working until 3 pm, they arrive later. They do not invite other families to your home. Stop being a doormat and set some standards.", "NTA.  Perhaps the environment would've been more \"welcoming\" if the relatives had asked about inviting more people than just the 5 family members.  Inviting people to someone else's house without the homeowner's permission is never okay.  I would've been very upset as well.  Why should you care about ruining their pool party?", "NTA - No means no.", "NTA. Looks like you're going to have to create boundaries about pool use now. Also, no it's not normal for families to use the pool when you are not there. Inviting extra people over without asking would be a huge no for me. Who does that?", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother repeatedly trampled over boundaries and common courtesy. \n\n1. He invited additional people without asking you first. Having a pool can open the door to tons of liability issues if something goes wrong or someone gets hurt: therefore, you should always be made aware of who is currently at your house using your pool and not be surprised by uninvited guests and children who aren\u2019t even your own personal friends! \n\n2. Common courtesy should dictate that, if it\u2019s not your pool, you don\u2019t overstay your welcome. You keep your swim short, 1-2 hours at most, and clean up pool toys, leaves in the water, wet towels, etc. when you\u2019re done. Then you leave so that the homeowners can enjoy the pool themselves at their leisure. It wasn\u2019t like you invited him and his family over for a big pool party on the weekend: *they* asked *you*. And then proceeded to spend six unsupervised hours in your backyard. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is also an asshole in this situation for excusing away his brother\u2019s inconsiderate actions. Unless you are intentionally hosting people you have invited to spend time in your home, you are under no obligation to create a \u201cwelcoming atmosphere\u201d. Your home is for YOU. YOU live there. You do not have to be welcoming to uninvited guests who are encroaching on *your* time in *your* home.", "NTA - it\u2019s very clear his familial boundaries are different. **But it\u2019s rude to invite yourself over to a another\u2019s home to host a party.**\n\nIf that\u2019s normal for your fianc\u00e9, now would be the time to talk and set some real and concrete boundaries.\n\nI think what his brother did was rude. Your home isn\u2019t a community pool and it shouldn\u2019t be treated as such, whether you know the other people or not. \n\nBut again, this is a fianc\u00e9 issue. It\u2019s his home too, and if he\u2019s fine with this but you\u2019re not then there need to be some conversations around that. *However, objectively speaking, his brother has a lot of nerve throwing a Sunday Funday at your home. He didn\u2019t fully share his plans, which is deceitful.*", "Also a liability", "NTA.  In the US, if anyone gets hurt at your house, you can be potentially liable for medical costs and other damages.  With family, that normally doesn\u2019t happen, but with outsiders, it can.  Is your fianc\u00e9 aware of that?  \n\nYour fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother should not have invited others to your house without asking first.  Family time is just that, family time.  Not other unrelated families also joining in.", "I say NTA. You said yes to your fianc\u00b4\u00e9's brother and wife and children coming; not four entire households. That was rude and inconsiderate of them, and I'm not surprised you were ticked off. Your fianc\u00b4\u00e9 doesn't seem to be very interested in your feelings about this - is that a pattern with him?", "NTA and this is the worst part of owning a pool, IMO. A family member was visiting us some time ago, when we still had a pool. While we were at work, they invited friends and kids to come swim. I get home, bunch of people in the pool, acting like they own the place, my kitchen floor is wet and our bath towels are strewn everywhere. I'm an introvert and don't like unexpected guests anyway. I reacted much like OP, husband got mad.", "NTA.   no respect.  How about we go over to his brothers house next Saturday and do whatever we want", "NTA. You need to be really upfront with these people. Tell them you didn\u2019t appreciate them inviting people to your home without permission. This isn\u2019t rocket science. When someone lends you their car, you don\u2019t let someone else drive it. If someone says you can use your pool, you don\u2019t get to let everyone you know come to their house as well. It\u2019s common courtesy. Then stop letting them use it.", "NTA\n\nYou were already being generous. They invited people without asking. They did stay a while, but you don't indicate you gave them any time limit.\n\nI would say: if you allow anyone to use it, you've got to be upfront about limitations. It's rude for them to simply assume without asking that inviting people and staying that long was fine. But it's also a bit ridiculous to blindly assume that people follow your personal social conventions, not lay down the law (like asking them to leave by X time, etc), and then be angry at them for not knowing exactly where the lines were.\n\nAlso note: liability. Someone else's kids drowns in your pool and depending on the circumstances, you may have a big legal issue on top of the loss itself.", "NTA - My reaction would have been the same in every respect.", "NTA\n\nThere's an easy compromise here. \n\nGuests must ask permission to use the pool at least 24 hours in advance. \n\nGuests must provide a guest list. They must be prepared to hear that not everyone can come. They cannot add additional people unless they ask. \n\nGuests must accept time limits set by hosts, whether they like them or not. \n\nGuests must provide their own towels and suits. \n\nGuests must bring their own drinks, other than water, and their own snacks. \n\nGuests must obey all orders from the hosts, for example, no running in the pool area, no horseplay in the pool, etc. \n\nDon't like the rules? Don't use the pool!", "NTA.  I bet the bitter feelings you had were jealousy. I would have been, too. You have to work and they're throwing a party at your own place. You were right. They weren't there to see you.", "NTA", "NTA.  Ex pool owner here and no one ever used my pool when I was not home, absolutely not, way too much liability otherwise.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 needs to do a lot of growing up, either that or they\u2019re delusional to the point of not understanding how the real world works.  I cannot fathom a sentient adult actually thinking the way your fianc\u00e9e does\u2026..it\u2019s truly odd and baffling to me.", "NTA", "NTA", "no", "ESH they shouldn\u2019t have invited other people to use your pool with out your permission and that should 100% be addressed but you acted petty and rude in front of your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family. You should have gone out and interacted at least for a little while and then tell them to communicate their plans with you in the future.", "I would have HUGE issues with family members making my yard their party with no heads up. I wouldn't want strangers walking into my house to use the bathroom or get ice while I was busy working.\n\nI would never let them return without a specific invitation.\n\nAlso, there are legal liability issues as well as home security and safety issues.\n\nNTA", "ESH.  They should not have invited additional people over without asking first. Make it clear going forward that you're not okay with that.   You could have handled it better instead of being bitter and petty.", "ESH. They asked to come use your pool. Then you get pissed and all in your feeling bc \"they were just there for the house, and didn't care to see you, the home owner\".  No shit Sherlock, they asked to come use your pool. Only thing they did wrong was bring the extra people.  You sound pissy others are having fun while you work.", "So there was only 2 hours of them being there during which you were working and you were free for the rest? At first I was going to say you\u2019re not the AH but it sounds like you don\u2019t even like your husband\u2019s family. If you did, you would be able to shrug off the frustration and go have a good time. If you chose to carry on your usual day instead of embracing family time, I have to assume there\u2019s some alternative motivation. If anything, what are we missing from the story? It just doesn\u2019t sound complete.", "> I got in a pretty bitter mood from it all and stayed inside\n\nYTA for being passive aggressive when the entire situation was ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT because you refused to tell them no or ask them to leave.

This whole straight to DIVORCE the second someone makes a mistake...\n\n...something tells me in the next 10 years, I should become a divorce lawyer.", "Seriously, go to a public pool with life guards and stuff. Mind boggling", "When i was a kid, in the 90s i would usually go to my best friends house in the afternoon, uninvited, with my swimsuit and a towel in my backpack. Then we would proceed to have lots of fun on his pool.\n\nThen, when it wasnt me going to his house, he would come to mine, also uninvited, with a towel and a swimming suit.\n\nAlso the rest of the group, only we both had pools on our houses, would come to my house or his depending on where we would be spending the day. Almost every day, al summer. \n\nThose are some of my fondest memories from that age.\n\nAlso, family coming to visit and using the pool was completelly normal. Any excuse to use the pool would be cool to my mom.", "Yup! That's so true!", "I agree with you, but who wouldn\u2019t be a little mad that your guest family invited a whole party\u2019s worth of people to your home without asking?\n\nI def think she should\u2019ve gotten over it and had that conversation afterwards, but it *is* a frustrating situation.", "For real. When my SO has company over, I don't always hang out with them. They do board games and D&D a lot which I'm not into. But I always put in an effort to greet them when I have the time and chill for a bit before fucking off to play my video games.  \nI wouldn't sit in the basement and be like *God damn they don't care about me, only about my big dining table*", "A BIT rude? It's off the charts rude.", "Problem is they did say it to their partner. Their partner vetoed them", "I'd be a bit miffed if my fianc\u00e9's brother invited himself over.. then brought even more friends with him!  But if the fianc\u00e9 wasn't upset about it, I'd probably just roll with it..  its how his family works..  if she's this upset about them coming over for 2 hours without the host being present.. only to decide to hold on to the anger for 4 more hours to prove a point.. honestly,  it's just a difference of what she and her fiance find acceptable.   But her acting like she did won't win anyone over in the long run...", "Lol 20 mins.  For a family of four with small kids, my laundry is endless and I\u2019m never \u201cdone\u201d. \n\nBut I would never use that as an excuse to not hang out. Yes it\u2019s annoying when people come when your house is not presentable, but she should have taken 20 mins to clear out the main areas and gone outside for a bit", "Whites just dont understand brother", "Right. But she isn't really communicating this. She held it in, then brought this to thousands of internet strangers. The OP isn't comfortable communicating.\n\nI have resentment towards my wife's family. It took a year or two to really be open with it. I'm frustrated and angry and uncomfortable with how close they are to each other, how closed off from the world they are, and how they've been somehow so negligent of my wife, particularly with her personal, academic, career and social achievements... Even our wedding, total indifference and a lack of involvement. I don't like being around them and I still struggle to look past how much theyve deprived my wife of a better earlier life. We spoke about it, I was open about it, and she knows how I feel. I find it makes being around them just a bit more tolerable. I know she knows. And I know how she feels about it, and I know how she feels about knowing. \n\nOn the contrary. My mother has been very supportive to me and my family. To a fault that's overbearing and at times, is too much. My wife sees her as a second mother and at times appreciates her as a mother that her own mother could never be. But sometimes, it's too much. And sometimes, it frustrates her just a bit. This is MY norm, so I miss it sometimes. Eventually, she was open about it. Then there's my father...LOL.\n\nWe both don't LOVE how we feel about each other's families, but we both recognize that these feelings are more than reasonable. But the fact is, we have had a very open dialogue about how we feel about each other's families, to the point where's there's an unspoken sort of acceptance and awareness of this. And it's made our tolerance of family better, and our communication, even better. \n\n\nIt's a total utter non issue. Not that it ever was an issue, but it could have been if we didn't talk about it..\n\nOP needs to talk about this.", "Yes, I'm so thankful.  K comes over every sunny weekend day and when she was thinking of moving I was heart broken!  Who will float with me?  She usually swings by after her early morning workouts and wakes me up.  \n\nSince my mother died, it's not just boring, it's depressing and makes me sad.  So K knows she's doing me a favor to come hang out with me.  Honestly, she usually just falls asleep LOL I'll wake her up to spray her with sunscreen.  We both appreciate a good nap.  My other girlfriend is crazy busy, but she likes to come when she can. My bestest best guy friend lives far away now.  \n\nI'd rather have people even if they weren't as close, but I'd plan that in advance.  Especially, because I like to be a good host and provide drinks and snacks.  Honestly, when we built the house, everyone was talking about how they'd be here every weekend.  In practice, people are far too busy.  Especially, those with children.  \n\nSo I'd rather have SOMEONE come over at least once a week to swim with me.  I have to treat and clean the pool whether it gets used or not.  And my husband just doesn't like to swim or get in.  He prefers to play videogames in his office.  Which is fine.  Neither my husband nor myself pretend to be anything other than who we are. \n\nOur friends know he doesn't want to hang out outside.  Just like when we go to our friends houses for parties (ugh football), we drive separately.  I like to say hello and mingle. I make snacks and enjoy snacks, then I leave cause I don't want to be there for hours and sports aren't my thing.  \n\nI don't like couples who can't do things without the other.  The chick in this story didn't want to entertain people, she wanted to do chores.  No one should judge her for that.  Fuck, you're at HER HOUSE.  \n\nI'll even set up game nights for my husband and make all the plans and arrangements and then not play.  Hell, I'll even cook everyone dinner.  Then I'll be upstairs while y'all play.  Have fun!", "It's NEVER just one thing. A disagreement like this is a good indicator that the couple is not communicating well, which is going to lead to much greater problems than a family pool visit.", "If we start that the brother asked to come by instead of waiting for the invite......and follow with OP saying no and the fiance saying yes and them his family coming and bringing all the rest, yeah a lot of people stomping OP boundaries and dismissing her on her own house", "I've been married for 20 years,  and can confidently say, you are being ridiculous.", "Here I was thinking I was going insane at some of these breakup suggestions folks are making. This is one of the most mundane conflicts in the scope of marital issues  that I can think of. Basic communication/ lessons learnt/ setting boundaries in the future. I've yet to meet a person with a perfect relationship, even with their in-laws"]}
