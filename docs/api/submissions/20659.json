His brother, Jay, had asked the day before if him and his family (wife + 3 kids) could come over on Sunday to swim after one of the kids\u2019 sports games, which was at a park close by to us.\n\nNow, fianc\u00e9 and I own a business together that requires WFH (work from home) on Sundays. Everyone that we know is aware of this, including his brother. I voiced my opinion that I felt it was weird for people to be at our house while we were working in the basement, but fianc\u00e9 assured that it would just be chill. He said it\u2019s normal for family to use people\u2019s pools even if they weren\u2019t home.\n\nSo, we let them come thinking that they would swim for maybe an hour then leave. But it wasn\u2019t just them. Fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents also came (we figured they would), but the kicker is that Jay also invited 2 of his friends plus their partners and their kids as well. We do know these people but both fianc\u00e9 and I were not aware of this beforehand.\n\nSo now it\u2019s a full on party in our backyard while we are working in the basement. I became very annoyed that they did not only invite themselves but some of their friends as well. It made me feel guilty that I couldn\u2019t be in my own backyard to host people because I was working. It also felt like they were just using the house and didn\u2019t really care about seeing us, the homeowners. Not to mention, the house was a complete mess. We had a busy Friday and Saturday and I didn\u2019t bother cleaning much before because I figured it would just be Jay\u2019s family. \n\nEveryone was here from 1:00 PM til 7:00 PM. We finished work around 3:00 PM, at which time fianc\u00e9 put on his swim trunks to join them outside. I got in a pretty bitter mood from it all and stayed inside. I didn\u2019t say hello to anyone cause I figured they weren\u2019t even here to see me, just my pool. I did some laundry and some cleaning up and I did end up seeing a few people who were coming inside to use the washrooms. I said hi and tried to make some small talk but I really wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nFianc\u00e9 came in and said that I was creating an awkward/unwelcoming atmosphere by not being outside. I told him I never planned to have a party today so I was just carrying on doing what I originally had planned which was laundry and cleaning.\n\nFianc\u00e9 keeps saying that I was rude for not joining them outside after work. He also says things like \u201cthe pool is meant to be used\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s family time\u201d.

I hope you\u2019re prepared for unexpected and unwanted guests for the rest of your life. Your fianc\u00e9 clearly thinks your home is a community center, and you clearly think it is a private place. Neither approach is \u201cwrong\u201d but they are entirely incompatible.", "NTA - it is rude to invite people to someone else\u2019s house without clearing it with the owners first. Your fianc\u00e9 obviously didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, but you two need to iron that out soon, because it doesn\u2019t sound like this will be a one time occurrence.", "NTA.\n\nThey invited themselves over to YOUR property, with no consideration of giving advanced notice of the extra people. They're treating your space like theirs and that's not right. \n\nSet some clear boundaries and tell them when they can or cannot come to the pool, and establish the rule that they need to ask for permission/give heads up before they invite anyone else.\n\nThe only rude people are Jay and his wife. And your fiance's not very helpful either.", "NTA...Your fianc\u00e9 disregarded your feelings on this from the beginning.  Now you are known as the house with the free pool.  You need to nip this in the bud right away or your home and garden will be overrun all summer.", "NTA\n\nI mean who invites people to someone else's house without as much as asking ? And since your partner accepted it just like that, you can see a glimpse of your future. So there may be people who are fine with this kind of thing, but you are obviously not it, so if you are not prepared mentally for this kind of crap all the time,please try some stern talking/counseling about boundaries ,and if your future husband still does not understand that it is also your private space , then I would re-evaluate thewedding maybe ?", "NTA Nope, nope, nope. I understand that feeling of being invaded, boundaries stomped, exploited and the lack of control; it feels horrible. Years back I took a nap on.a Sunday afternoon & woke up to neighbors in my kitchen prepping & announcing that they were hosting a barbeque at my house ( with a lot of my food) that my husband had agreed to. They invited some other people. WOW! I wish I'd simply kicked them out, but I felt so much confusion since husband  had apparently agreed. It was hard to even be agreeable.  Never again!", "NTA - this is shitty behaviour all around.\nYou dont invite other people to a house you dont live in.\n\nYour fiance is an AH too, for allowing this BS", "NTA\n\nFirst off, anything that happens in your pool, you are liable for, and comes out of your homeowners insurance\n\nSecondly, even though it was pretty clear that only those who people were allowed, you should\u2019ve made it even more clear as people showed up, that, unfortunately the invite/accepted invitation was for those few people.\n\nEspecially these days, everybody wants to sue somebody for something, Always think liability, liability, liability.", "NTA. This would annoy the hell out of me too. Especially being expected to be social after work. You and your fianc\u00e9 need to have a talk about family boundaries before you get married.", "NTA - It appears that you and your fiance have different views on pool guests, which is a cause for concern. BUT, your guests (his bro and family) are completely rude for asking other people to join them for a pool party at your house without your permission. They are either clueless or really selfish. In addition, if someone got hurt, you would probably have some liability (you should definitely check this).", "NTA. I agree that it it unacceptable for your family to have invited their friends without asking first. I also think that your fianc\u00e9 should have backed you up when they were overstaying/invited more people, but he seemed more interested in hanging with friends then backing you up. I would sit down with your husbands and voice your concerns and then set more clearer boundaries with your husband's brother. I think it should be okay for him and the family to use your pool occasionally though as long as he isn't bringing over a whole party every-time and doesn't overstay", "NTA and weird honestly that people would come to someone elses house to have essentially a pool party while they are inside working... and then stay for 6 hours. What the hell? \n\nAlso Fiance should be ashamed they ignored your concerns and feelings.", "NTA\n\nLegally, you are responsible for the safety of the pool.  Having guests in the pool when you can't be there to supervise means that you can't intervene if people are making poor safety decisions, yet if someone gets hurt, you are responsible.  You don't know if these people know how to swim, if they will supervise their kids properly, if anyone has a medical condition that makes swimming unsafe.\n\nAnd your BIL had no business inviting people to your home without discussing it with you first.  And planning it much farther in advance than he did.  \n\nHow much of a mess did they make of your home, adding to the stuff you would have cleaned if you knew guests were coming, but didn't get to clean?  How much of your food did they eat?  How did that impact your plans for the week?\n\nThe cleaning issue is a big one.  Your fiance may have invited his brother. But, the world being what it is, if people are judgmental about the house being messy, it's going to be thrown on you, not him.  If your fiance is inviting people over, it is his job to make sure that the house is suitably clean for guests before they arrive. \n\nYour fiance's brother was family.  The rest of the guests were not. Since you or your fiance didn't invite them, technically, they were trespassing.\n\nYou need to discuss with your fiance that if he invites people over, he needs to make plans with you and discuss it in advance.  And if the people he invites show up with uninvited guests, he needs to step in and have them leave, not encourage your home as a public gathering place for the uninvited.\n\nThe main problem is with your fiance.  He should not have invited his brother without talking to you. If his brother asked, he should have said he needed to talk with you and see if it would work for both of you.  And he needed to be clear to his brother that the invitation was only for him and his family, not a more general invitation to anyone the brother wants.\n\nAlthough I do wonder if your fiance knew your brother would be inviting guests, and just didn't bother to tell you.  Which would be an even bigger problem in regards to your relationship.\n\nYou have a fiance problem.  If he doesn't admit and agree that he was out of line, starting from inviting his brother to your shared home without discussing it with you first, and at every step thereafter, I'd think twice about if you want to live this way, because it won't be a one-time problem.", "NTA. Why is it not rude for people you don\u2019t even know to be invited to your home? That\u2019s ridiculous", "NTA you need some serious boundaries with your fianc\u00e9 and his family. If you are working until 3 pm, they arrive later. They do not invite other families to your home. Stop being a doormat and set some standards.", "NTA.  Perhaps the environment would've been more \"welcoming\" if the relatives had asked about inviting more people than just the 5 family members.  Inviting people to someone else's house without the homeowner's permission is never okay.  I would've been very upset as well.  Why should you care about ruining their pool party?", "NTA - No means no.", "NTA. Looks like you're going to have to create boundaries about pool use now. Also, no it's not normal for families to use the pool when you are not there. Inviting extra people over without asking would be a huge no for me. Who does that?", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother repeatedly trampled over boundaries and common courtesy. \n\n1. He invited additional people without asking you first. Having a pool can open the door to tons of liability issues if something goes wrong or someone gets hurt: therefore, you should always be made aware of who is currently at your house using your pool and not be surprised by uninvited guests and children who aren\u2019t even your own personal friends! \n\n2. Common courtesy should dictate that, if it\u2019s not your pool, you don\u2019t overstay your welcome. You keep your swim short, 1-2 hours at most, and clean up pool toys, leaves in the water, wet towels, etc. when you\u2019re done. Then you leave so that the homeowners can enjoy the pool themselves at their leisure. It wasn\u2019t like you invited him and his family over for a big pool party on the weekend: *they* asked *you*. And then proceeded to spend six unsupervised hours in your backyard. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is also an asshole in this situation for excusing away his brother\u2019s inconsiderate actions. Unless you are intentionally hosting people you have invited to spend time in your home, you are under no obligation to create a \u201cwelcoming atmosphere\u201d. Your home is for YOU. YOU live there. You do not have to be welcoming to uninvited guests who are encroaching on *your* time in *your* home.", "NTA - it\u2019s very clear his familial boundaries are different. **But it\u2019s rude to invite yourself over to a another\u2019s home to host a party.**\n\nIf that\u2019s normal for your fianc\u00e9, now would be the time to talk and set some real and concrete boundaries.\n\nI think what his brother did was rude. Your home isn\u2019t a community pool and it shouldn\u2019t be treated as such, whether you know the other people or not. \n\nBut again, this is a fianc\u00e9 issue. It\u2019s his home too, and if he\u2019s fine with this but you\u2019re not then there need to be some conversations around that. *However, objectively speaking, his brother has a lot of nerve throwing a Sunday Funday at your home. He didn\u2019t fully share his plans, which is deceitful.*", "Also a liability", "NTA.  In the US, if anyone gets hurt at your house, you can be potentially liable for medical costs and other damages.  With family, that normally doesn\u2019t happen, but with outsiders, it can.  Is your fianc\u00e9 aware of that?  \n\nYour fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother should not have invited others to your house without asking first.  Family time is just that, family time.  Not other unrelated families also joining in.", "I say NTA. You said yes to your fianc\u00b4\u00e9's brother and wife and children coming; not four entire households. That was rude and inconsiderate of them, and I'm not surprised you were ticked off. Your fianc\u00b4\u00e9 doesn't seem to be very interested in your feelings about this - is that a pattern with him?", "NTA and this is the worst part of owning a pool, IMO. A family member was visiting us some time ago, when we still had a pool. While we were at work, they invited friends and kids to come swim. I get home, bunch of people in the pool, acting like they own the place, my kitchen floor is wet and our bath towels are strewn everywhere. I'm an introvert and don't like unexpected guests anyway. I reacted much like OP, husband got mad.", "NTA.   no respect.  How about we go over to his brothers house next Saturday and do whatever we want", "NTA. You need to be really upfront with these people. Tell them you didn\u2019t appreciate them inviting people to your home without permission. This isn\u2019t rocket science. When someone lends you their car, you don\u2019t let someone else drive it. If someone says you can use your pool, you don\u2019t get to let everyone you know come to their house as well. It\u2019s common courtesy. Then stop letting them use it.", "NTA\n\nYou were already being generous. They invited people without asking. They did stay a while, but you don't indicate you gave them any time limit.\n\nI would say: if you allow anyone to use it, you've got to be upfront about limitations. It's rude for them to simply assume without asking that inviting people and staying that long was fine. But it's also a bit ridiculous to blindly assume that people follow your personal social conventions, not lay down the law (like asking them to leave by X time, etc), and then be angry at them for not knowing exactly where the lines were.\n\nAlso note: liability. Someone else's kids drowns in your pool and depending on the circumstances, you may have a big legal issue on top of the loss itself.", "NTA - My reaction would have been the same in every respect.", "NTA\n\nThere's an easy compromise here. \n\nGuests must ask permission to use the pool at least 24 hours in advance. \n\nGuests must provide a guest list. They must be prepared to hear that not everyone can come. They cannot add additional people unless they ask. \n\nGuests must accept time limits set by hosts, whether they like them or not. \n\nGuests must provide their own towels and suits. \n\nGuests must bring their own drinks, other than water, and their own snacks. \n\nGuests must obey all orders from the hosts, for example, no running in the pool area, no horseplay in the pool, etc. \n\nDon't like the rules? Don't use the pool!", "NTA.  I bet the bitter feelings you had were jealousy. I would have been, too. You have to work and they're throwing a party at your own place. You were right. They weren't there to see you.", "NTA", "NTA.  Ex pool owner here and no one ever used my pool when I was not home, absolutely not, way too much liability otherwise.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 needs to do a lot of growing up, either that or they\u2019re delusional to the point of not understanding how the real world works.  I cannot fathom a sentient adult actually thinking the way your fianc\u00e9e does\u2026..it\u2019s truly odd and baffling to me.", "NTA", "NTA", "no", "ESH they shouldn\u2019t have invited other people to use your pool with out your permission and that should 100% be addressed but you acted petty and rude in front of your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family. You should have gone out and interacted at least for a little while and then tell them to communicate their plans with you in the future.", "I would have HUGE issues with family members making my yard their party with no heads up. I wouldn't want strangers walking into my house to use the bathroom or get ice while I was busy working.\n\nI would never let them return without a specific invitation.\n\nAlso, there are legal liability issues as well as home security and safety issues.\n\nNTA", "ESH.  They should not have invited additional people over without asking first. Make it clear going forward that you're not okay with that.   You could have handled it better instead of being bitter and petty.", "ESH. They asked to come use your pool. Then you get pissed and all in your feeling bc \"they were just there for the house, and didn't care to see you, the home owner\".  No shit Sherlock, they asked to come use your pool. Only thing they did wrong was bring the extra people.  You sound pissy others are having fun while you work.", "So there was only 2 hours of them being there during which you were working and you were free for the rest? At first I was going to say you\u2019re not the AH but it sounds like you don\u2019t even like your husband\u2019s family. If you did, you would be able to shrug off the frustration and go have a good time. If you chose to carry on your usual day instead of embracing family time, I have to assume there\u2019s some alternative motivation. If anything, what are we missing from the story? It just doesn\u2019t sound complete.", "> I got in a pretty bitter mood from it all and stayed inside\n\nYTA for being passive aggressive when the entire situation was ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT because you refused to tell them no or ask them to leave.

But given lemons, you could have made lemonade", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur fiance is the AH here.", "NTA.\n\nAnd it's time to ditch fianc\u00e9 if he's going to let his family trample all over YOUR comfort.\n\nYou two aren't even married yet!\n\nFind a way to throw him back and find somebody WORTHY of you.", "NTA, I would definitely make it clear next time, if there is a next time. No friends, additional guests are allowed. Also put a time limit on it.", "NTA. Unless you have a serious conversation about boundaries with your fianc\u00e9, expect more unwanted pool parties.", ">\\[fianc\u00e9\\] said it\u2019s normal for family to use people\u2019s pools even if they weren\u2019t home.\n\nHow many pool parties have you been invited to at his relatives' homes without the homeowners being present? Unless the number is greater than zero, your fianc\u00e9 appears to be lying to you.\n\nFuture BIL asking if his immediate family could use the pool also appears to have been a lie. If he wanted to throw a party, he should have asked for your permission to throw a party.\n\n>Fianc\u00e9 came in and said that I was creating an awkward/unwelcoming atmosphere by not being outside.\n\nMore lying. Fianc\u00e9 and his brother created the unwelcoming atmosphere, not you.\n\nAt a bare minimum, tell your fianc\u00e9 that his brother will have to use some other relative's pool from now on because you clearly can't trust him to say what he means and mean what he says.\n\nAlso think long and hard if you want to marry into a family where everyone takes advantage of you and lies to you.", "Agreed - she also has a fiancee problem.", "Exactly, you did not agree to host a party, you have no obligation to entertain Jay\u00b4s guests. \n\nNTA", "Also, having to deal with people walking into the house to use the washrooms? Heck no.\n\nFianc\u00e9 will only understand OP's point if someone gets hurt while using their pool, or if some of the people Jay invites over breaks something inside OP's house, and then plays the \"it wasn't me\" card.\n\nNTA", "Also was going to respond to this part. It wasn\u2019t rude of OP for not joining them. It was rude of them to show up in the first place. NTA.", "I would argue it\u2019s both. Who invites a ton of people to someone else\u2019s house without asking first?? That\u2019s so incredibly rude.", "This is the most concise statement that sums up the real issue!", "Disagree. OP is NTA, but it's not the brother, it's the fianc\u00e9. Everything here indicates fianc\u00e9 was not only fine but happy with the situation. So, his brother just followed that lead.", "It makes me wonder if maybe the fiance did actually know that there were going to be other people there. He seemed to adapt to it really fast and not have any issues with it. \n\nI'm a hardcore introvert and I need to know whether there are going to be people in my space. For those saying that it isn't a big deal to have people over, it's even less of a deal to freaking communicate that you're planning a PARTY in someone else's home.", "I have a feeling fianc\u00e9 knew and OP was left out, it\u2019s a communication problem.", "I'd be disinclined to socialize with anyone who turned \"can my family use the pool after the kid's game on Sunday?\"  into inviting 6 other adults + kids to my house for a party.", "This is just a weird way to view it.  She doesn't seem to have a huge issue with the people being over that she knew were going to be over.  The biggest issue sounds like the guests she wasn't aware of.  It also sounds like her husband would've been very angry about her asking them to leave.  This story is like 10 v 1.  How do you think that would really play out for OP?", "You were already being generous.", "People you don\u2019t even know to be invited to your home? That\u2019s ridiculous", "Just sounds like the fianc\u00e9 is more laid back about friends and family using the pool than OP is. \n\nOP was perfectly capable of asking them to leave after an hour or so, and could easily have said they needed the peace and quiet to work.\n\nWaiting until it's gone on a while then sulking/cold-shouldering everyone is childish, whether the family brought a couple extra people unannounced (not that that isn't a bit rude itself) or not.", "[removed]", "Fiance most definitely knew it was going to be a party.", "Entitled assholes who think everyone owes them everything because they consider themselves the next coming of the Lord.", "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s necessarily a *problem*, just a pretty severe misalignment when it comes to the pool/having guests over/boundaries. Sounds like OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 likes having guests over and doesn\u2019t mind people using their pool whenever. And it IS his pool, too. He does get a say on who uses it and when.", "You're not wrong that brother followed the lead of OP's fianc\u00e9. But I do think that even if OP were okay with the brother's family being there, the brother still invited two other couples and their kids without checking with either of the homeowners, which isn't okay. The fianc\u00e9's parents are one thing, since OP at least knows them, even if OP didn't know they were coming. But it's crazy to just invite people to someone's house that the homeowners don't know without asking. \n\nAnd maybe that's on the fianc\u00e9 for something said in the past that OP doesn't know about, or maybe he knew about it and OP didn't and he played dumb. Either way, they need to communicate about this more clearly, because this will become an issue if they don't.", "Yep, same. And even if I know people will be there, they need to accept that I might hermit and they won\u2019t see me.", "During work hours, too. I'd be fuming with that much background noise during and immediately after work and I'm an extrovert. The fiance sounds like an absolute bellend for not only accepting this behavour despite OP being uncomfortable, but then encouraging it and telling them they were in the wrong. No one has to be social if they don't want to, particularly after work hours.", "The only thing that makes me lean the way I did is because the husband joined in and had a good time (presumably). It\u2019s his family and he clearly loves and enjoys them.", ">the fianc\u00e9 is more laid back about friends and family using the pool than OP\n\nOf course he is. It's *his* side of the family. \n\nIt's very usual to have an agreement that each spouse deals with their own side of family, to prevent some \"how dare you say that?\" comments. \n\nWanna bet that neither the fianc\u00e9 nor his brother (and his extended uninvited guests) would be amenable to OP going out there and say \"people, that's enough, I have work to do\"?", "I understand what you are saying, but it was not \"a couple of extra people,\" it was two whole families. During her WORK HOURS. And yes, she could have and should have spoken up. I think her reaction after work was done was more to her husbands nonchalance than the actual guests. They seem to have communication issues.", "Bot account", "Wonder how much fianc\u00e9 will side with her given he already called her rude and being disrespectful to the guests who invited themselves or maybe fianc\u00e9 was aware of the number of guests already \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "That\u2019s exactly why (to me) this is a fianc\u00e9 issue. The couple has to tackle this issue in a united way. They need to decide together and then enforce the rules together. Until that\u2019s done, the family is just a side note.", "It became a fianc\u00e9 problem when he decided he had the right/authority to chastise OP for choosing to not host his brother\u2019s unsanctioned pool party. OP was not responsible for entertaining her BIL\u2019s guests. She should not have been asked to force herself to plop on a fake smile to do so. His choice to prioritize uninvited guests\u2019 comfort and feelings over his partner\u2019s comfort and feelings is most definitely problematic. And for dismissing her concerns without even acknowledging that his brother lied and overstepped. Lastly, he messed up by not confronting his brother over his entitlement. He could have easily asked him into the house and spoken to him privately.", "And he's clearly used to their boundary-busting ways, while OP is not.  That doesn't make OP wrong.", "Yeah, would probably have caused issues for months.", "But I didn\u2019t say OP was wrong", "You insinuated that there is some issue on *her* part (\"it sounds like you don't even like your husband's family\" and \"I have to assume there's some alternative motivation\") or that OP left something out of the story.", "That\u2019s definitely your interpretation.", "Those are *direct quotes.*", "Yep."]}
