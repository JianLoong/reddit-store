{"id": 16124, "submission_id": "134p4yb", "title": "AITA Monthly Open Forum May 2023: Rule 2 - Voting Rules", "selftext": "#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\nThis month, we\u2019re taking a look at one of the more \u201cquieter\u201d rules. While maybe not as prominent as rules 5, 7, or 11, rule 2 is still very important. It also covers two aspects of the sub, and can sometimes be a bit confusing.\n\nThe first part of the rule comes up in Modmail from time to time.\n\n> Upvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. **DON'T** downvote if you think OP is an asshole. **DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH.** Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don\u2019t engage.\n\nWe sometimes get Modmail messages that ask why their comment is being downvoted so heavily, or trying to report that their comment is being downvoted. We have this in the rule as an attempt to try and head off the down votes (it worked for me, before I became a mod). But ultimately, we can\u2019t do much about downvotes. They are anonymous. So we have this as part of the rule to remind users that we welcome different viewpoints that are presented civilly. That includes unpopular takes that aren\u2019t attempts to mask hatred/bigotry, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to see comments like \u201cWhere are the assholes?\u201d or \u201cWhy are so many posts NTA?\u201d and we get that. It\u2019s natural to want to upvote those you think may have been wronged, or were not the asshole. Upvoting an asshole may seem like a reward, or validating their poor choices/behavior. Yes, an asshole may get some of that sweet, sweet karma that they can then turn around to do absolutely nothing with, but that\u2019s not what we care about. Upvoting asshole posts brings them to the front page. \nTo be clear, we\u2019re not talking about the ragebait shitposters. We covered trolls in our [February 2023 Monthly Forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qxvu1/aita_monthly_open_forum_february_2023_trolls/). We encourage you to report potential ragebait posts for rule 8. Please don\u2019t engage or comment that it\u2019s fake, etc. Report and move on. Remember - **DON\u2019T FEED THE TROLLS!**\n\nThe second part of rule 2 can be a bit trickier to navigate.\n\n> Don't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. **Brigading will earn a permanent ban.**\n\nWe aren\u2019t kidding about this violating [Reddit\u2019s site-wide rules.](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) As we warn in our rule, brigading will earn a permanent ban. We know posts from this sub are often cross-posted or shared in other subs. Regardless of which sub a post may be cross-posted or shared to, participating in the discussion in both subs is brigading. Encouraging users participating in the post in another sub to come vote or comment here is also very much not permitted. Our best advice on any post is to choose the discussion on one sub and participate in that sub\u2019s discussion only. Don\u2019t participate in the discussion of a post on multiple subs.\n\n\u2014\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\n#[We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://forms.gle/M7i7hSF9iUUkHkqm9)\n\n**We\u2019re currently looking for mods with Typescript experience.**\n\nWe always need US overnight-time mods. Currently, we could also benefit from mods who can be active during peak \"bored at work\" hours, i.e. US morning to mid-afternoon.\n\n* You need to be able to mostly mod from a PC. Mobile mod tools are improving and trickling in, but not quite there yet.\n\n* You need to be at least 18.\n\n* You have to be an active AITA participant with multiple comments in the past few months.\n\n---\n\nWe'd also like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar!

I'm going to run with them and tweak 'em just a little to fit our sub's specific situation, someone posts \"AITA for not eating the apple?\" That post gets crossposted to r/applesareawsome and r/applesaregross.
