I work in a compounding pharmacy and do this daily but it gets double and triple checked by people who know what they're doing, and done carefully in a lab with ppe and special weighing equipment. Also, tablets often have a lot of fillers in them alongside the active ingredient which can make for an uneven or bad consistency liquid, and if they aren't crushed well can also lead to consistency issues.  Just buy the Childrens formula", "Nurse here. The child is also only 1.5 years old. Well below the age limit to give any meds (anything under 2). Consult your doctor or pediatrician first.

No crushed grown up meds please.", "DCF\u2026?", "Not just a math problem though. Suspension of the active ingredient is a major issue. Strawberry juice is not going to keep everything evenly distributed and the kid may end up ingesting wayyyy to much even if the math is right.", "The math is simple but how would you ensure that the med was evenly dissolved in the juice?

Definitely don\u2019t mess around with Tylenol!", "The marketing of natural/holistic remedies for children do not have any relation to side effects profiles of entirely different medications in pediatric patients. \n\nSome natural/holistic remedies work wonderfully. \n\nMany natural/holistic remedies work... not at all. Why are they sold, then, you ask? Because pharmaceutical companies know that parents hate seeing an ill child and will try anything to make their child better. As many medications aren't available in over the counter dosing for pediatric patients due to difficulty meeting requirements for approval (happy to talk more about this if anyone is curious), narrow therapeutic ranges, rare but severe potential side effects, etc., these companies smelled an open space in the market and jammed some crap on the shelves knowing it would sell.\n\nAnd some natural/holistic remedies can be just as or more deadly than the side effects of lab-developed medicines.  \n\nThe reason I say this is because it's very important that people understand that natural/holistic remedies have the same potential to be harmful as lab-developed medicines.  A medicine being lab-developed does not mean that it has a higher chance of being harmful/having severe or complicated side effects, and a medicine being holisitic/natural does not mean that it has a lower chance of those same adverse events. \n\nMedicine is a complicated, tricky thing that people spend decades studying.

Children's liquid medicines nearly always come with a little dosing cup or syringe that measures in whatever the dose is listed in.\n\nAlso, 15ml is equal to just barely over 1 tablespoon so the conversion b/t systems is fairly simple in this case.", "It shows a chart with x ml for children 14-18 lbs, x ml for children 19-23 lbs, etc. The actual lbs are probably different, but it is written in that format. The max allowed dosages are different than the label says, anyway, so when my son has a high fever, the doctor does the math for his current weight for me. We are trying to keep him out of the emergency room right now and have to give the exact maximum dosage to control the fever (4.375 ml, based on his weight).
