In this situation, it's important to consider both perspectives and the emotions involved.\n\n1. Communication and Boundaries: It's understandable that you communicated your discomfort with being recorded and explicitly asked your mom not to film or share the video. It's important for family members to respect each other's boundaries and wishes.\n\n2. Consent and Privacy: Sharing personal moments, especially when someone is vulnerable due to anesthesia, should only be done with consent. Your mom's decision to post the video without your permission violated your trust and invaded your privacy.\n\n3. Emotional Impact: The consequences of sharing the video have been distressing for you, both at school and emotionally. It's natural to feel hurt, embarrassed, and betrayed when personal moments are made public against your wishes.\n\n4. Expression of Emotions: Choosing to give your mom the silent treatment is a way of expressing your hurt and disappointment. However, it's important to communicate your feelings in a healthy and constructive manner to address the issue.\n\n5. Rebuilding Trust and Communication: Consider having a calm and honest conversation with your mom about how her actions have affected you. Express your feelings and discuss the importance of trust and boundaries within your relationship.\n\nWhile it's understandable that you feel hurt and betrayed, it's also important to find ways to address the situation constructively. Perhaps seeking support from a trusted adult, like a school counselor, can help facilitate a conversation between you and your mom to resolve the issue and rebuild trust.\n\nSay something along the line of \"Mom, I want to talk to you about something that has been bothering me a lot lately. When you posted that video of me on anesthesia after I explicitly asked you not to, it made me feel really hurt and betrayed. I have always expressed my discomfort with being recorded, and I trusted you to respect my boundaries and privacy. The video being shared without my consent has caused me a lot of distress, especially at school where people are teasing me about it. I feel like my privacy and wishes were disregarded, and it's been really tough for me to deal with the consequences. I hope you understand how much this has affected me emotionally and socially.

And hold your ground - I wouldn't speak to your mother until she apologizes, takes the video down and fixes this situation.

My mum was bad for this and taught me at a young age that giving someone the silent treatment was okay if you were angry at them. Kind of backfired when she died without us resolving our conflicts because I'd given her the silent treatment. Unfortunately, they were still married so my dad took her side. I was a daddy's girl and never got to resolve things. It was incredibly sudden, he died in his sleep on Xmas morning.

Your parents may hold that over your head if you continue to react to their drama. So just look up narcissistic parents and the grey/gray rock technique for dealing with them, if you're going to be stuck being dependent on them for a few years. I don't know if they're actually narcissistic as diagnosed by a professional, but grey rocking is one of the most effective methods I have found for dealing with toxic people I can't quite get away from for whatever reasons.  \n\nYou basically want to make yourself bland to them so they don't have much of anything to use as ammunition against you. If you give them a total silent treatment, that's not bland. That will attract their notice. That's ammo for their drama and they will turn it around saying it's abusive to them.  You've already seen they just make an issue and retaliate. \n\nSo be interactive but bland.  Very bland. Speak when spoken to, look pleasant and engaged, but don't give much more.

But when I think of \"mommy blogs/vlogs\" and the like exposing their children to massive audiences in vulnerable moments, I'd call that destroying families. I've known of \"autism parents\" often being particularly egregious offenders. And that's to say nothing of \"\"pranks\"\" done for clout and other crap more typical of teens and young adults\n\nBut whatever we're calling it, op has a right to privacy and is totally justified at being extremely pissed here", "When the addiction causes their child to be bullied and harassed in school, I will argue it DOES destroy families the same way as hard drugs!", "It\u2019s asshole behavior, that\u2019s what it is. I myself am addicted to social media and the internet in general in the sense that I waste too much time online and it affects me negatively. But since I\u2019m not a malicious asshole who gets a kick out of humiliating and hurting my family, I would never dream of taping someone without their consent and posting it online when they didn\u2019t want me to. \nPlenty of people were assholes in the 1990\u2019s. For instance, I remember hearing about parents who kicked their 14-year-old son out of the house. \nSocial media didn\u2019t create any more assholes; it just provided new ways to engage in assholish behavior.", "Even worse than dismissive they are actively punishing OP for responding to the event exactly as promised/warned. The recording is arguably unforgivable but to then double down by punishing a completely reasonable - and dare I say more mature - response is truly mind boggling.

Hope you\u2019re doing okay.", "I'd be with you if OP hadn't already (extensively to the point of daily, as stated in the original post) communicated their boundaries to the mom, and/or if the violation wasn't so extreme. If the mom was capable of accepting communication from their child, this situation would not have happened. \n\nThere is nothing in the mom's behaviour that indicates communicating after the violation would be respected. She is not unaware of why her child is angry. She simply does not care - at all - about how her actions have impacted them. Why is she going to start caring after the fact? \n\nI agree with you that silent treatment is retaliation and punishment in a situation where communication is possible. In this specific situation, it's not a punishment - it's simply the consequences of the mom's actions. Why should you expect engagement or communication from someone you have repeatedly ignored and then grossly violated?\n\nLogistically, OP will eventually have to communicate with the parents. But in that case I would recommend they move forward with tactics the pros DO recommend - information diets, grey rocking, and then, once they are free of the current home situation, going full no contact unless honest apologies and changed behaviour have somehow miraculously ensued.\n\nI personally would handle this by disengaging completely (grey rocking 24/7) until I could get out of that house, while also flagging the online content on every platform on which it was posted to get the parent's rights to post removed/ banned for violation of a minor. I would have all my friends do the same (cumulative reports mean swifter action from YouTube, etc.) Given that the parents care more about going viral then they do about their child, no doubt this will be the harshest punishment of all for them.", ">  If you don\u2019t verbalize your reason/need for your silence\n\nYeah. He should have done something like tell her multiple times over many days.\n\nOh wait...", ">Your response (nc asap) is immature and sad.\n\nI missed this when I first read your comment, but it's ironic you think NC in this situation is \"immature and sad\", given that you think a parent videotaping their 17 year old for internet fame while they are drugged, and expressly against their repeatedly stated wishes, is a \"common but unfortunate prank\".\n\nWould you feel the same if your partner or parent videotaped you in these exact circumstances, the footage was viewed thousands of times, and your co-workers/boss played it over and over while you are at work?\n\nEven if that's something you'd just love to happen to you, and ethics aside - depending on when and where the film was taken, posting it at all may be illegal without the subject's consent, and if OP was not a minor unable to remove themselves from this situation (it's tricky to get a C&D lawyer at 17 for something your own folks did to you, and they may retaliate by escalating the abuse), would be lawsuit material depending on the state/country you reside in. \n\nThe parent may have an out legally if they filmed OP in a public space, but if it occurred in a private space (the home, etc) - the law in North America and UK considers that a crime, not a \"prank\". Especially if the videotaping occurred within the medical center (that violates HIPAA laws, something the Federal Government takes very seriously indeed). And yes, this applies even if it is a parent filming a minor - children have rights, too, and are not the IP of their progenitors in this, the year of our lord 2023.\n\nHave you considered that at 17, most folks are doing college applications or job applications? Apart from the cruelty and emotional abuse impacting OP's mental health, there are very real consequences to not being in control of your online brand in this day and age. This is a violation that is extreme on multiple levels, and NC is the rational response to folks who have proven that their amusement is worth more to them than your wellbeing.", "You're correct, in this case the consent of the minor doesn't actually matter as the consent of the parent supersedes their own. Could OP get it taken down in a year or so when they turn 18? Maybe, depends on the local law.

It doesn't take much effort to download a video from one social media platform and post it to another.\n\nOPs mum doesn't get a pass just because another relative posted the video to YouTube, OPs mum should have respected OPs wishes and not filmed him, or at least kept the video to herself.", "In North America, unless you skipped grades, or started school very early and then finished early, at 17 you are most likely in grade 11, maybe 12.
