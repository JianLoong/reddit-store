Is there any reason why you have an intact six year old dog?\n\nI'm leaning YTA now because I think you're making your sister pay for a procedure that you as a dog owner are responsible for. Not to mention that dogs in heat may try to run or escape, and this may have contributed to your dog running away like she did. You mention she \"went to find you,\" but I'm calling BS on that.

Especially a first timer. Abort this litter for her sake. She's about to be a senior.\n\nYou also don't know the size of the male. If your dog is a smaller female, and she has larger puppies... that's also a risk. This is a bad situation all around.\n\nThe only reason I'm going a little soft here is that people absolutely underestimate how crazed female dogs get when in heat.

For everyone commenting about the heat issues\u2014 female dogs can have silent heats\u2014 which means there\u2019s no EXTERNAL sign of the female ovulating. No swelling of the vulva or nipples, no discharge, no bleeding. Female dogs can also ovulate much later in a cycle than the 10-14 days after bleeding or have split heats. This also can contribute to not being aware that the female is still able to be pregnant. \n\n\nFor perspective, let\u2019s change the narrative a bit:\n\nIf she had handed a CHILD off to her sister and told her to always hold the child\u2019s hand or the child will run off, and her sister didn\u2019t follow those directions\u2014 who /should/ be responsible for the medical bills if that child was injured? \n\nThat\u2019s right, the sister. \n\nThe sister was NEGLIGENT in her care of the dog. OP has full rights to decide whether her dog should or shouldn\u2019t be spayed. The sister was asked to follow specific care rules and she did not. The result of that being an unwanted litter of puppies that required OP to get a costly procedure done to remedy. \n\nThe sister is the AH, not OP.", "And out comes the pediatric spay/neuter supporters.
