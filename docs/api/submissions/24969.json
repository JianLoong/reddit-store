She said she'd love to and that I didn't have to pay her at all because it's not much of an inconvenience since she has two (spayed female) dogs of her own, and we worked out all the details including that she'll be in a strange neighbourhood without her owner so she needs to be leashed even for bathroom breaks (they don't have a fence on their yard, just one of those picket ones across the front)\n\nCertainly you know where this is going by now; day 2 my sister takes her out to pee with her other dogs without a leash, and she runs off to try to find me. She was out for SIX HOURS before my sister found her, and only because she came back to the block on her own. I got home late that night and she only mentioned to me then that she had been out on her own for hours. I was upset but didn't say anything too bad, mostly just that she should have told me immediately.\n\nI didn't really think of it as the main issue since she wasn't in heat, but 2 weeks later, her nipples were prominent and it was obvious she was pregnant. I have no interest in becoming a backyard breeder so I asked what type of termination my vets recommend and both of them recommended a spayabort since she's 6 years old, it's easier on her body and she's fully developed already. I'm not thrilled about it but it is what it is. \n\n$750 surgery all told. As soon as I got the quote I told my sister that I'll be expecting her to pay for it, but that I'm willing the deduct the amount I would have paid her for dogsitting had she not refused payment. I also said I'm fine with a payment plan if she can't pay that much right now. At first she said she'd pay half but not more, then devolved into it not being her fault at all because I wasn't even going to pay her, which obviously doesn't make much sense but I'm wondering if she's upset because she expected me to \"insist\" more when she said no to payment? I only said \"are you sure?\" or something to that effect, I didn't really push it at the time. \n\nAnyway, we went back and forth for a few days both before and after the surgery, and she finally ended up sending me the money, then blocked my number. I called our mom to talk about it and she said that my sister felt like I was making her feel worse and more guilty about a mistake she already feels bad about. I asked if she could tell my sister for me that I don't want her to feel bad and I understand mistakes happen, I just don't think it's fair for me to foot the bill for it. That just made everyone angrier. I don't know what to do! \n\nAITA? Should I send her the money back/apologize?

Is there any reason why you have an intact six year old dog?\n\nI'm leaning YTA now because I think you're making your sister pay for a procedure that you as a dog owner are responsible for. Not to mention that dogs in heat may try to run or escape, and this may have contributed to your dog running away like she did. You mention she \"went to find you,\" but I'm calling BS on that.

If your dog is a smaller female, and she has larger puppies... that's also a risk. This is a bad situation all around.\n\nThe only reason I'm going a little soft here is that people absolutely underestimate how crazed female dogs get when in heat.
