Heck, she ate it and liked it. \n\nIs there a chance she might've had an odd incident, in her past, with someone who was keto/vegan/vegetarian/pescatarian/etc? Maybe someone who was resentful of her diet? Someone who insulted her, making her feel bad about her diet?  Perhaps this was a trigger to her, because she's had people in her past hurt her. \n\nIf there was no one in her past that insulted her, then her being defensive seems a bit strange. This is only conjecture, but I'm just wondering why she had such a reaction. Plus, she's insulting your diet, telling you to cook pasta like a normal person.\n\nNTA, but maybe have an amicable conversation.", "NTA\n\nI'm not keto and not interested in being keto, but who serves and requires bready/starchy carbs with every primary meal?

Who freaks out about a single keto meal like they're being poisoned? This is so OTT that it doesn't fit at all. Why she would even make fun of your own personal diet choice also makes little sense to me. It's almost like she feels threatened somehow, but I can't figure out why. Unless your private thoughts about her dietary choices and immature palate somehow come through to her that you are not aware is happening?\n\nWhen you say \"trick\" in your title did you really mean to trick her into thinking it was regular rice until you were asked? Did you gloat about it actually being cauliflower once you were asked? \n\nHave you explained to her that it really helps a medical issue of yours and the added weight loss is also positive for you? Maybe telling her you admire her workout ethic and you're glad that works for her and you hope she can see that you've also found what works for you would help smooth things out?\n\nWhile you're NTA for serving a nutritious meal, so long as you really weren't being \"tricky\" about it somehow, and her reaction was very odd indeed, I think something else is up. Is your brother bothered by how she eats? Maybe she felt ambushed? This just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.", "Unless they are from a religion, ethic group that doesn't like pork, +++ for serving bacon.\n\nSounds like a nice meal. It's not like you were sneaking meat, dairy into a vegan meal. Not like you were serving gluten to an intolerant. Not like you snuck dog or horse onto the menu in a culture that finds it distasteful. The objective was to break bread...food and bond as a family. Blood or by union. \n\nNta based on the blowup. Was there a lot of lead up?
