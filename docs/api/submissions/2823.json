Reading the way you write about her food and yours makes it clear that the moralizing that is inherent in \"healthy eating\" culture, or \"keto\" culture, is the lens through which you see everyone else's choices. It's cool you found something that works for you. That doesn't mean it will work for everyone else and, frankly, even if it IS working for you for some reasons it could be hurting you in other ways if you're not fully aware of how your body uses different foods and its sensitivities.

It\u2019s not good for a prolonged period)", "I can only judge based on whats in the post and OP is judging SIL hard in this post. (And yes SIL is an AH for making fun of OP too. I did say ESH.)", "That's amazing!! That sounds similar to the diet I'm on. Which I guess is technically keto, but I won't call it that because people assume it's like the \"bacon and butter keto\". I haven't seen much weight loss (only 30 lbs) but that's because of the  PCOS and/or there's another problem the doctors are trying to figure out. There's definitely something else wrong. But it's been a year and I've gotten no answers as to what the other issue is. Last time I went to the nutritionist she said I should have a piece of bread with dinner because I wasn't getting enough carbs. I'm at my witts end trying to figure this out and my relationship with food is becoming very not good. Some days I wake up and the idea of eating makes me so anxious I just don't eat for a day. And whatever the other issue leaves me with so much discomfort. Almost like a cross between a racing heart, feeling hungry, it being hard to get enough air, and stuck burp? But my heart is fine, I'm definitely not hungry, burping doesn't help, and my oxygen levels are fine. Diabetes or a thyroid issue seem like the most obvious answers but both were checked 4 times each and I'm fine there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Did the doctors tell you that you had to change your diet back when you got pregnant or was that your choice?

When my husband and I did it we ate lots of veggies, lots of salad. Yes, the veggies had butter on them, sometimes a cheese sauce. Avocado oil was a big player. It's about balance. It's also not something we did long term. Sometimes we'll do it for a couple months then back to a normal diet. Salmon with a lemon butter cream sauce and broccoli was one of our favorite meals. It wasn't butter sauce with a side of salmon and broccoli lol. \n\n\nKeto is fabulous for a lot of people with drug resistant epilepsy, but their keto is very, very carb restricted.", "Yeah, but they clearly state it was put on the menu for SIL.

So he said not to take Metformin and to just \"diet better\". The nutritionist (who works with my GP) said my diet is as perfect as it's going to get and I actually should be having slightly more carbs.  But my gyno says that's what will help me lose all the weight because with PCOS diet alone isn't really going to work. So I don't know who to believe or what to do. And I think the weird health issue I've been dealing with is stomach related, but I need a referral from my GP because of my insurance to see a gastro and they won't give it to me.
