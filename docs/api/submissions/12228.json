My children were immediately taken to her, and we've had her for about a week. I got her from a work friend who had an accidental litter, so I got her for free and brought her home on a whim.\nYesterday I got news that my best friend's mother had to watch her chihuahua get hit by a car as she was calling him back across the road, and apparently she was sobbing in her yard for hours while holding him until her husband got home. It broke my heart, so I offered to gift her our new pup to make her feel better. I dropped the dog off this morning, and when I told my husband afterward, he was pissed. He said I should have at least talked to our kids about it first, but I honestly thought it would be easier to do it and then tell them about it when they get home from school. I plan to talk to them about compassion for our family friend and assure them we can find a new puppy soon. \nI really thought I was doing something good for my friend, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: OKOK I get it, this was a terrible decision. Should I get the dog back? How will I explain it to my friend's mom?", "created_utc": 1678745112, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qneuo/aita_for_regifting_our_new_dog/", "score": 916, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This makes no sense to me. Your children were attached to this dog and you took it away for no reason. If this woman who lost her dog wanted another dog, there are plenty out there to adopt. Also, you seem to make a lot of family decisions without consulting your husband. I\u2019d be pissed too if I were him.", "YTA\n\nYou gave away your family's pet without any talk to any of them.\n\nI'd feel betrayed if I came home and our dog was gone just so mom could score brownie points with her friend.  Hope the dopamine hit you got from that was worth it.  Your children may never trust you again.\n\nThe dog wasn't yours to give away.  It belonged to the whole family.\n\nWhy didn't you first approach your work friend to see if they had any other pups that they needed to rehome or at least talk to your family first?", "Honestly if I were the friend's mum I'd be pissed off. My dog just got killed in front of me - you can't just replace it like it's an appliance that broke. I had a tough time bonding with our new puppy even tho I'd had time to grieve the previous dog. The puppy was cute, sure, but he was bitey and barky and annoying and just made me miss the old dog who was calmer but still waggy and happy and didn't crap the bed in the middle of the night.", "Info how long will you keep the new puppy before you give it away again?", "YTA. This is a live animal, not a bag of potatoes. You also considered your friends mothers feelings more than your own children\u2019s.", "YTA This has to be fake, I don't see how anyone can sit there and write out that their children have bonded with a puppy and then give it away without a second thought and then have the audacity to ask if they were an asshole. You should have spoken to your family, this was a *family pet* so it should have been a family decision.", "INFO: how does one type out that entire story and still need to ask?\n\nShould you get the puppy back? Sure. Make sure you traumatize the animal, and your friend, and your kids,  who will be terrified their puppy will disappear again. /s\n\nWere there no pups left in the \"accidental litter?\" Your husband is right to be furious.  He and your kids deserve a dog. You should get yourself a new toothbrush or something else that's inanimate and disposable.", "The day after Christmas must be terrifying for the kids at your home. YTA", "YTA You gave away your kids\u2019 puppy. Next time bring a casserole.", "YTA, please do not get another pet. They are not toys or things to be passed around whenever you feel like; they are living beings who rely on a family for care and a stable life. You clearly do not understand this and should not be a pet owner.", "YTA, don\u2019t be a pet parent if you consider the pet expendable.  You gave away a family member.  Your best friends mom could have found a pet when she was ready to have a new fur baby.\n\nJust admit it, a puppy was WAY more work than you anticipated, this was an easy solution to you weaseling out of having a pet.", "YTA. Wtf? If her kid had gotten shmucked by a car, would you give her one of yours, too? No? Well, a dog is a living, breathing family member, and you just GAVE IT AWAY. \n\nHow do you know your chihuahah has the same temperament as hers did?\n\nWhat makes you think a random brand new one will fix her grief for the dead one? \n\nWhat makes you think a random brand new one will fix your kids' grief over the ONE YOU JUST TOSSED AWAY?\n\nSo many questions. This is the worst thing I've seen on here in a while.", "YTA.  First off, you brought home a dog on a whim....like didn't discuss with hubby?  So you have this dog that the kids are starting to love and then just give it away also without discussing?  Are you just the unilateral decision maker in your home?  Your husband is 100% understandably angry.\n\nMaybe if you had discussed it first, you could have come up with a plan to help that didn't include giving away a member of your family.  Like, see if there were more puppies from that litter.  Go to a shelter.  Find another dog to give her.  Or get her some flowers. Dog gifting is a big deal, like was she even ok with it?  I'd be like, \"Thank you, but too soon!!!\"", " YTA-You gave away a LIVING THING to accommodate someone else! Imagine this: you adopted a child, and the kid adapted to your family, and really formed a special bond. Your neighbor suddenly loses their child? Are you going to offer up your newly adopted child to the neighbor? Obviously not! Because that would be a decision that would impact EVERYONE. You do things on a whim. Apparently being inconsiderate is one of those things. Next time just MAYBE take your family into account because they exist too. YTA.", "YTA. What you did is fucked up.", "YTA - What a cruel thing to do to your children, to have them love a little puppy and then give her away with no thought for their feelings, that's going to be a horrific talk an you'll end up feeling awful. You deserve to. You cannot play with children's feelings like that. You gave their puppy away!!!! That's a monstrous thing to do and you will probably find that your children will stop trusting you. for a long while. \n\nIt's the fact that you seem to be expecting plaudits for your actions that take the biscuit. You've hurt your children to help your friend. Unbelievable.", "This has to be fake,  no one is seriously this dumb to wonder if they are the TA in this situation. YTA", "YTA. Was the friend even ready for a new dog? Did you ask? Or did you just take it upon yourself to do whatever you wanted because *you* thought it was the right thing to do? And now your kids are also sad because the dog they already became attached to is gone.", "So you brought home a puppy, your kids got immediately attached to it because of course they did, and then you took it away? Without speaking to them first? Can you really not see how YTA in this situation? Trust issues incoming.", "It\u2019s not an item of clothing! Your kids probably got attached quickly and cannot understand why it has suddenly been taken from them. I can see you were trying to do something good for your friend but it was at the expense of your families happiness. You didn\u2019t even do the minimum and speak to them. YTA.", "YTA. You care more about your friend's mom than your own kids?", "YTA, obviously.  Dogs aren't toys, and it would have been a shitty thing to do to your kids with a new TOY, even.\n\nDid the woman even WANT a new dog right away?  They're READILY available in shelters all over, so she certainly didn't need your help acquiring one anyway.  Imagine thinking Dogs are so meaningless that you could just replace it when someone's old one died, like a fucking toaster.", "YTA you can't do that without talking to your family first. You put kindness toward someone else over kindness to your own family. How are they going to trust that you won't do the same with the next pet or gift?\n\nNot to mention that you can't just replace a dog. You're not alleviating any grief over the one they lost. They're still grieving.", "YTA. You got it as a gift...for your family. Or so you claim. You act like it was yours to give. If you *really* wanted to have that compassion talk, why didn't you do it beforehand? Your kids aren't going to be able to trust that if you bring home a new pet (which should be a family member to you), you have no problem getting rid of it without so much as a warning. How are they supposed to bond with another animal knowing any second you might give it away again? You fucked up OP, and tbh I'm not sure you can fix it at this point.", "YTA big time. Your children were attached and you just up and gave away their new pet/family member. That's messed up.", "YTA. This is a spectacular way to make certain your kids never trust you. You gave them something to love, let them get attached, and stripped it away. As several people above stated, your kids are going to need therapy. They will not forget that you did this. It\u2019s pretty damn heartless.", "Are you joking? You let your children form a bond to a living creature, then tore that creature away from them without any warning. This is how you give kids trust issues. YTA", "Welp, your kids are gonna need therapy. Not a talk about compassion towards someone they couldn't give a shit about currently. That kinda shit *sticks*. They'll be thinking about this as adults, how their own mother took away their new friend.\n\nYes, YTA.", "YTA. A dog shouldn\u2019t even be outside alone or be called across the road. That is what happens. But your poor kids.", "YTA. Dogs are not gifts or presents, they are sentient living beings, not trading cards to be swapped on a  whim. You cannot and should not even be thinking the sentence \u201cI re-gifted a dog\u201d, I honestly think this demonstrates that you are not suitable for pet ownership and that you lack a basic respect for this dog.\n\nListen, I choose to believe that hopefully, your heart was in the right place. But who are you to even decide that your best friend\u2019s mom is ready for a brand new puppy immediately after the death of her beloved pet? Not to mention how obviously unfair it was to just yank the dog from your household and give it away without consulting anyone but especially without running it by your husband who should be your teammate and co-decision maker.\n\nPlease think about why you are so cavalier about dog ownership and reflect on if this is healthy or fair to the animals involved, not to mention your children, who I assure you will be absolutely *crushed.*", "YTA, way to discount your children\u2019s feelings. My mom did something similar to this and I\u2019ve never forgotten it, and it\u2019s now been over 30 years.", "YTA my friends mom did this to her when she was a kid. She's now 35 and has refused to accept any gift from anyone ever since and refuses to have a pet despite adoring animals. in her words, \"I know it's stupid but I just feel like anything I love will be taken away, just like that damn, beautiful dog\" \nYou put compassion for someone else above the love and affection your family had for this dog. Basically given your kids the message that it doesn't matter if you're sad, So long as someone else is made happy as a result of your tears.", "YTA the fuck. The animal wasn't just a bag or a notebook discarded in a drawer somewhere nobody was using. It's not just about your children either, you have also affectedthe dog. Dog's have feelings too. You ripped that dog from the family that showed her love and gave it to a stranger. So she would have gone through seperation anxiety from leaving mum, and just after settling in with new family, you ripped her form them too. And the fact that you thought that was even better for your children, that they just come home from school and be told you gave the dog away. WTF Is wrong with you!", "YTA, what the hell? There\u2019s hardly a chihuahua shortage, I could walk to the nearest shelter and find you six or seven chihuahuas to gift your friend. Taking away your children\u2019s dog on a whim because it made you feel somehow self righteous is ridiculous behavior.", "Girl\u2026\u2026.what?\n\nOfc YTA - honestly that dog is going to be better off with a family that wouldn\u2019t give her up after 1 week. I understand feeling bad for your friend\u2019s mom but get her flowers? Or offer to bring her a meal? Or ANYTHING besides giving away your dog that you\u2019ve had for a week that your children love!!! I just can\u2019t wrap my head around hearing what happened and immediately jumping 100000 guns to \u201coh I\u2019ll just give her OUR dog\u201d like wtf OP\n\nEdit: adding in my two cents in response to OP\u2019s edit. Honesty, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You put yourself in a sticky situation. As much as it\u2019s going to suck for your kids I think my opinion is not trying to get the dog back. You made your decision when you gave the dog away and it sounds like you only want to get the dog back BECAUSE you\u2019ve realized how much you fucked up. Also, the lady you gave the dog to just lost her other one in a tragic way. If you thought this would help her heal, imagine how she will feel when you show up on her doorstep demanding the dog back", "YTA.", "YTA Do you not get emotionally attached to animals? I would think if you did you couldn't/wouldn't do this.", "YTA. This was a cruel thing to do to your children, and to the dog. I sympathize deeply with the person who had to watch their dog get hit, but you traded their pain for your children\u2019s. There was a way to help that person through their hurt, but this wasn\u2019t it.", "YTA- You let your kids bond with this puppy that they had \"immediately taken to\" and then give it away.  And don't see the problem?\nI can't wrap my head around your disregard for how your own family would feel. \n\nMaybe you could have asked if the work friend had another puppy for the woman whose dog got run over.\n\n\nI feel sorry for your kids.\n\nSer, YTA.\n\nEdit- left out words", "You wanted to look good at the sacrifice of your kids happiness. And then you expect them to understand? They're kids. YTA and a major one.  You think too much of your friends mum's feelings and not enough of your children.", "YTA \n\nYou brought a dog home on a whim and then gave it away on a whim. Don't lie about it being compassion. That's just an excuse for your fickle behavior. \n\nIf you cannot 100% commit to keeping a dog, do not bother getting the puppy back or getting another dog. It's not fair to the dog or your family.", "YTA.    What the fuck.    Let her kids her her a new dog...when she's ready.\n\nThat was an asshole move", "And now your kids are grieving the loss of their pet..way to go clueless mom..do it for the kudos with your friend and your kids be damned aye? tut.", "While you're talking to them about compassion for your family friends, make sure and really drill in the fact that the emphasis is on friends and not family. You took a puppy away from your own kids just so your friend could replace a dog she *just* lost... as if that dog was even replaceable in the first place. \n\nAw, your furry companion got squished, that's okay here's a new one. The level of cognitive dissonance here is astounding, you seem to have the emotional range to feel bad that someone lost a pet, but not enough to realize that now your children have lost one too, and that pets aren't just objects you can replace with a shinier, newer one. \n\nRegardless...\n\nWatching your dog get run over is truly horrible, but your friend is an adult, she is capable of getting herself a new dog, if that's what she decides she wants to do. This was not your call. \n\nYou made a unilateral decision that affected your entire family without even thinking about it for more than a moment or communicating with *any* of them at all. \n\nYTA.", "How do you not realize YTA while typing this out\u2026.", "YTA. Please, don't take another dog !\n\nYou clearly aren't competent to take care of it. How could you get rid of it like that ? It is a sensitive being ! Going from a familly to another is already hard (traumatizing even sometimes) for those little ones. This is because of this behavior that we need shelters.\n\nI work in a shelter and I guarantee you we would never let you get home with one of our babies.\n\nToo bad for your children by the way, I think they will be traumatized too and there's no replacement puppy that will fix that. \n\nOMG ..\n\nEDIT : Also, a living animal is NOT a gift it is a responsibility.", "YTA. Please don\u2019t get another dog. You seem to think they\u2019re like trading cards.", "YTA it's a puppy not a tray if brownies.", "Yta\u2026.you re-homed your kid\u2019s pet which I\u2019m sure they were attached to without talking to anyone first.

Cause this is the biggest YTA I\u2019ve seen. \n\nYou gave your family a puppy\u2026. And immediately took it away?! My god I\u2019m praying this is fake. \n\nWhy on earth would you cause your own children this kind of heartache? You need to sit down with yourself and really think WHY you thought this was ok.

That's not a lesson they'll forget anytime soon.  Congrats on traumatizing your children and an innocent puppy.  Truly great work you accomplished on a whim.", "Yes, you are the AH.    You took a new pet away from your Husband and children without even thinking about how they might feel.   You decided you'd sit them down and TELL THEM HOW THEY SHOULD FEEL.

And you\u2019ll explain to them why their sadness is actually a moral shortcoming, and how YOUR sacrifice of their happiness is the superior way to be.", "Wow this if really horrible!

I want to hope your kids get a new pup, but who\u2019s to say you won\u2019t ditch it if you randomly decide to get rid of it. Pets aren\u2019t toys or gifts. People love them like family.

It might very well be the end of this friendship but, you need to choose your children over this friend and their mother unfortunately. It's going to hurt alot, but if your friends mother hears that you literally stole your children's dog from them, she might be understanding of your mistake. You're going to have to swallow your pride if you want to maintain your family. Family is a glass ball, don't drop that shit.", "YTA - you meant well, but ultimately you just hurt your kids.", "Wow, way to break your children's hearts.  This was definitely the wrong thing to do and you are thoughtless and so many instances - getting the dog in the 1st place and then ripping it away from your children. Honestly you shouldn't be making any more decisions by yourself and include your husband because you're clearly not right in the head.\n\n If possible you call your friend immediately and tell her you made a mistake and you didn't understand that the children were already bonded with that dog. Then you give her the phone number of the person that you got the dog from so she can call and find out if there are any left and she can go and pick one out herself.\n\nAnimals are not presents!! They are lifelong decisions. YTA.", "YTA. And that\u2019s so fucked up on so many levels. If one of my animals died and someone tried to replace it with a random dog, I would be absolutely livid on top of heartbroken.", "YTA you need to be at adoption center as door opens come weekend and let your little ones pick them a new pet\u2026 you can\u2019t take back from friend that lost theirs\u2026", "Good intentions and how often they go awry.

He'd get bonded to a pet then she'd give it away. He's had a hard time bonding with our pets, and an even harder time letting go at the end.

YTA obviously.", "YTA. Please don't get anymore pets. You don't deserve them. You lack the the maturity to understand that you don't pass pets around like candy.", "YTA. If not a troll, congrats on destroying your kids' trust in you. Seriously. I've watched this happen growing up. Her mom is still upset that she knows nothing about her grown daughter's life. It started with the dog, then the empty promises her mom gave, watching her parents fight because mom was like you putting others over the family for ego boosts, etc.\n\nFace it, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Even getting the puppy back isn't going to magically fix what you broke.\n\nEdit to add: u/unclepapadan also didn't just screw up your relationship with your family either. You screwed up your relationship with your work friend as well. They are going to ask how the puppy is doing. And from my experience, they are going to be upset that you gave the dog away regardless of circumstances.  \nSo you have 4 relationships to consider. Your children, your husband, your friend and your co-worker. Let the mom keep the dog and have 3 damaged by your actions, or take the puppy back and have 1 damaged and 2 repairable (assuming coworker doesn't know of this yet) situations.", "YTA I'd divorce you if I came home and the dog was gone.", "I know you seem to have realized YTA, but HOLY FUCKING SHIT YTA. I cannot imagine being that child to come home to find their best friend has just been given away", "This was a whole train of terrible decisions.\n\nYou took a dog on a whim, without consulting anyone else in the family about it, especially your partner. Also without any research or planning.\n\nYou let your kids bond with it and then just gave it away.\n\nYou may have kinda pushed a new puppy on someone grieving the loss of the dog they were bonded to. Getting a new pet, especially a baby one, is something people have to decide for themselves when they're ready. Not just have one dropped on them. (Mild caveat with cats, because half the time they just show up and drop themselves on you, but that's beside the point.)\n\nWhat were you thinking? At every stage you were...frankly irresponsible.\n\nI don't even know where you should go from here. You dug yourself a right pit. I suppose the best thing to do is go and grovel about your eejitry to your friend and let her know there are other pups in the litter *if she's actually ready for one*. DO NOT (because I could actually see you doing this) go pick one up and try push a swap on her, for heaven's sake. Actually get her input instead of making decisions all over the gaff that other people have to deal with the consequences of.\n\nEdit: it may be tempting, but also don't just go get a replacement for your family from your work friend either to save face with your friend. It won't work. Your kids in particular will be wary of bonding with it for fear that you'll change your mind again and it'll be gone some day.\n\nYTA.

I promise you, your kids will remember this and you put yourself in a difficult situation because how are you going to get your kids dog back?

My children were immediately taken to her, and we've had her for about a week. I got her from a work friend who had an accidental litter, so I got her for free and brought her home on a whim.\nYesterday I got news that my best friend's mother had to watch her chihuahua get hit by a car as she was calling him back across the road, and apparently she was sobbing in her yard for hours while holding him until her husband got home. It broke my heart, so I offered to gift her our new pup to make her feel better. I dropped the dog off this morning, and when I told my husband afterward, he was pissed. He said I should have at least talked to our kids about it first, but I honestly thought it would be easier to do it and then tell them about it when they get home from school.

She decided on a bird a long time after that cat died.\n\nMy point is, you need to ask anyone you gift an animal to before you do it, it's a cute surprise and all but I don't believe in surprising people with animals.

I\u2019m not diagnosing you with ADHD or anything else, but your impulse issues require you to learn tools on how to manage them because you are now negatively impacting innocent people all around you with your whims.

The dog isn't a therapy dog, she doesn't exist to make people feel better.\n\nAnd the obvious thing is that the dog was for the family but you decided she was solely yours to do with as you see fit. You let your kids down to cheer someone else up without even telling them or discussing it with them and your husband. Also if you get another dog, maybe don't get it on a whim.
