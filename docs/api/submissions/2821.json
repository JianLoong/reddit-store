Start with your reasonable boundaries. They're flexible and in a \"teachable moment\". You trap more flies with honey... do you really want your BF's buds to double-down on being immature assholes?

Both in the sense that the act of having sex is a gift of trust to your partner and back and that as a partner you can give sex as a special gift. If you know your partner has a fantasy or desire that you don't mind but are not especially interested in, you could gift that to your partner if you want to. \n\nBut the initiative should come from the gifter and not the receiver or their friends, and the receiver should feel no obligation to accept the gift. \n\nI have definitely gifted my husband sex as a gift in the past, like bondage where I act more dominant because I know he loves that, even though we are actually both more submissive in the bedroom. He does the same the other way around. So yes, sex can definitely be a gift but it should never be forced or feel like an obligation. \n\nI actually met my husband irl for the first time after we got together as his \"birthday gift\" this was my idea together with his friends and was a lot of fun (I was also fully clothed, not hidden away for more than 15 minutes and there was no other expectation of me other than the fact that I was there.)", "Gross.
