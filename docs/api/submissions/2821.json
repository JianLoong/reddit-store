Several bright red flags here. No sane woman puts herself in the hands of  a group of partying men for days without anybody knowing where she is, no matter what the reason.

And if they keep pushing, tell your boyfriend about it.", "NTA. They should have seen how messed up it was to just have you on standby for a few days while they\u2019re out having a fun time. They could have flown you in later or included you if they wanted you to be there. You don\u2019t owe them anything, especially after what they\u2019re saying to you.", "NTA\nTell your boyfriend about it and why you don't want to. It will solve the problem: that way it can't be a surprise anymore and he can see (or not) how creepy his friends are with you.\nWhy do they think they can tell you when you 2 have to have sex together???", "NTA and ew", "NTA in my opinion. What in the actual God-Forsaken Fuck?! So firstly that whole \u201cplan\u201d is pretty fucked up to me, but even leaving that out you\u2019re not an asshole. Call me crazy but even without the context of you being left alone for days with no one knowing where you are and then being revealed as a \u201cpresent\u201d only to be left alone again afterwards (yikes) I think you\u2019re well within your rights to just not go. If you don\u2019t wanna go on that trip, no matter the reason, it\u2019s your choice and no one should guilt you for it. The specifics just make it even worse. Again, this is just my opinion, but to me you are not the asshole in any way, shape, or form.", "Your not a call girls or a living sex toy. NTA", "NTA - this is gross. You need to talk with your boyfriend, explain how this has made you feel. His friends are creepy and the jokes about finding him a different present if you don\u2019t go is completely out of line. Talk to your boyfriend!!!!", "NTA\n\nDefinitely creepy on the friends' part.", "NTA. You\u2019re not an object.", "NTA.\nDo these guys have girlfriends or wives? If so, maybe they could help explain the stupidity of their suggestion. If not, well, I'm not surprised.", "Info: is this clearly about sex or possibly just about your presence?

NTA though, you are always within your rights to avoid pressure like that.", "NTA..you aren't something to be \"given\" to your boyfriend. Sex isn't something you owe someone because its their bday. Are these friends of his adults? They certainly don't seem to think like an adult..definitely do NOT let the ine friend guilt or manipulate you into agreeing even if he does insinuate that theyd get a replacement. Not sure how long you and bf have been together but these friends are a huge red flag. Id definitely inform him of his friends \"stipulations\"", "Sooo\u2026. Your BF\u2019s friends want to give him \u2018birthday sex\u2019 for his birthday and are effectively treating you like a living fleshlight to make that happen. Absolutely gross. I would definitely talk to your boyfriend about it, just because if you decline (and you definitely should) his friends would almost definitely encourage him to cheat on you.

Surprise can be a form of control and manipulation. Your boyfriend having a trip that is unlike what he has planned for could backfire. If your boyfriends friends want you to be a part of the trip for his birthday then they should run it by your boyfriend and the two of you should discuss it before hand.

This is the kind of thing I'd bring up with a partner and see how they react to it, and so they know what their friends are doing behind their back. Isn't enough info in the post to ascertain if your bf is immature as his friends. \n\nIf he's disappointed that you said no (and spoiled the 'suprise'), then I'd say consider being done with the lot of 'em. If your bf finds it as inappropriate as you do, then there's a chance of a way forward if your bf has matured faster than his friends. \n\nIf you don't feel comfortable about telling your bf, then that may also be a sign to end things.", "So they want you to show up, bang your BF and then leave?   Are they going to stand around while you have sex and high five him afterwards?  NTA and your BF's friends sound super creepy", "NTA.  They are rude entitled little jerks.

That just sounds bizzare.", "NTA. This whole thing is gross.", "NTA. Your BF has terrible taste in friends.", "Oh Silly - he will want to see you on his birthday and it's actually awesome they don't want to make him choose. Yes they were immature in their initial iteration that had you hidden and waiting for days, lol. (Boys). If they are willing to grow with your input, why lean into the negative when you can run with the positive?\n\nSo I think you could propose: first, you don't wait for days. They fly you in day of the surprise, and you get to have your own room/place to be comfy/day spy/ prep decorate however your heart desires. You're the queen and the birthday party isn't complete without you. \n\nIf you want you can host the actual cake/champagne toast gathering/fun and games whatever.

If they said \"hey join us on this date and this location and you can walk in to surprise him,\" that would be vastly different and sweet.  But the idea that they want her to not tell anyone where she is and they control her movements is not okay.", "Agreed that sex should not be a \"gift\" or an obligation. And it's especially disturbing and disgusting that his friends are pretty much openly admitting that they want her to have sex with him as a \"gift\" from them.", "It shouldn't be an obligation, but it is definitely a gift. Both in the sense that the act of having sex is a gift of trust to your partner and back and that as a partner you can give sex as a special gift. If you know your partner has a fantasy or desire that you don't mind but are not especially interested in, you could gift that to your partner if you want to. \n\nBut the initiative should come from the gifter and not the receiver or their friends, and the receiver should feel no obligation to accept the gift. \n\nI have definitely gifted my husband sex as a gift in the past, like bondage where I act more dominant because I know he loves that, even though we are actually both more submissive in the bedroom. He does the same the other way around. So yes, sex can definitely be a gift but it should never be forced or feel like an obligation. \n\nI actually met my husband irl for the first time after we got together as his \"birthday gift\" this was my idea together with his friends and was a lot of fun (I was also fully clothed, not hidden away for more than 15 minutes and there was no other expectation of me other than the fact that I was there.)", "Gross. Your sex life is none of their business. Don't go. NTA", "Sigh. Yuck.", "EW, just EW. Creepy frat boys written all over this setup. $100 bucks says they plan to listen in and/or film this too. \n\nI think you have a very clear indication how much they respect you as a person and a girlfriend."]}
