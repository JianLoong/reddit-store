Both in the sense that the act of having sex is a gift of trust to your partner and back and that as a partner you can give sex as a special gift.

He does the same the other way around. So yes, sex can definitely be a gift but it should never be forced or feel like an obligation. \n\nI actually met my husband irl for the first time after we got together as his \"birthday gift\" this was my idea together with his friends and was a lot of fun (I was also fully clothed, not hidden away for more than 15 minutes and there was no other expectation of me other than the fact that I was there.)", "Gross.
