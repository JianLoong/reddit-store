Both in the sense that the act of having sex is a gift of trust to your partner and back and that as a partner you can give sex as a special gift.

He does the same the other way around. So yes, sex can definitely be a gift but it should never be forced or feel like an obligation. \n\nI actually met my husband irl for the first time after we got together as his \"birthday gift\" this was my idea together with his friends and was a lot of fun (I was also fully clothed, not hidden away for more than 15 minutes and there was no other expectation of me other than the fact that I was there.)", "Gross.

(I mean, why don't they just say they wish they could shove her in the closet when she's not required, and be done with it.) Do NOT go on the trip, and your bf needs to rethink his choice of \"friends.\"", "What in the name of everything everywhere did I just read???\n\nThis is wrong in just about every single way I can think of! There are a lot of posts on here that make me angry, disappointed, utterly bemused, but this is the first one to truly leave me feeling Disgusted. (Capital letter intended.) I actually feel like I need a shower...\n\nDefinitely, unequivocally, NTA. I would tell your BF everything, show him any messages, and see how he reacts. If he thinks this whole thing is a great or funny idea, time to leave him far, far behind you.", "NTA but I smell a set up. I think their plan is more nefarious - any chance they want to try and get you go catch your bf in a compromised position? Hence the secrecy?", "NTA, don't do it, your bf's friends sound dangerous if they are being that manipulative with you", "If my boyfriend\u2019s friends came to me with such a proposition, I would straight up go to my boyfriend and tell him all of it. To hell with the surprise. Either he sets up boundaries with them and get them to start acting like decent human beings or cut contact with them. I would never put myself in the vicinity of these predators. That\u2019s right! I used the P word because men who speak like that think like that. They aren\u2019t just gross and disgusting. They are vile and waste of space. \n\nTell your boyfriend that his friends had the audacity to speak to you that way and see how he handles it. Because my boyfriend would beat the shit out of anyone who talks this way to me. And I wouldn\u2019t settle for anything less. \n\nNTA", "NTA..Euwww to his friends. Tell your bf about this matter and see his reaction.", "NTA - you should tell your boyfriend they asked you to do this. So highly inappropriate and frankly dangerous for them to suggest this.", "I once was my gf's birthday gift (because one of our shared friends had forgotten to get a gift), was very awkward as our relationship  was in rough weather and we broke up the same week...\n\nNTA to saying no, doesn't sound like you'll have fun. And your bf isn't expecting you so he won't be disappointed. (and if he cheats, better to find out now than in 10 years :P)", "I don\u2019t think anyone is an a , I think you\u2019re overreacting or taking it the wrong way, and I think they\u2019re dumb guys who don\u2019t know how to plan and normally wouldn\u2019t include a girlfriend in their plans but your man must obviously love you so much that they know you had to be apart of it in some way. Why don\u2019t you bring all your girls with you and you can do a reverse mama Mia on them?!!", "NTA", "NTA - Going on the nicest of interpretations of intentions these friends have managed at best to propose a situation you are uncomfortable with. Even if they are willing to make changes to this plan if you are uncomfortable no one should be trying to convince/guilt/whine you into said plan. You can simply say I understand you really want boyfriend to have a wonderful birthday and it\u2019s really sweet to want to include me for him, but I would be uncomfortable with going and I know he\u2019ll have a wonderful time with you. I really appreciate you guys respecting my boundaries. \n\nIf they don\u2019t get it from that. Then you can add. Hey guys I get that you\u2019re excited by this idea but I feel strongly about this and while I understand you have good intentions if feels like you are pressuring me into something I\u2019ve said I do not feel comfortable doing. \n\nAnd if you feel like you want to talk it over with your boyfriend. Just do it. I doubt he\u2019d want you to feel uncomfortable over his hopefully well meaning friends being pushy. Especially for his birthday. Heck maybe bringing it up directly will mean you will be comfortable and he will get to have you there or not but at least it means you trust that you can address your concerns with him and what boyfriend would be upset about that.", "\u203c\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f  NTA OP PLEASE SEE THIS \u2b06\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\n\nthe way they\u2019ve been so forward with you about this is highly concerning to me. they don\u2019t seem too worried about asking something so degrading of you. why? these are your boyfriend\u2019s friends; the people he talks to about you. if they aren\u2019t afraid to ask this of you, it\u2019s likely because they know exactly what he\u2019d think of it. look at the \u201creplacement gift\u201d comment. this is your boyfriend\u2019s friend telling you he (bf) would accept a replacement. good men don\u2019t hang with men who say things like this.", "Ahem. The red flags ya\u2019ll reference are overblown. These are dudes who want to get a guy laid on his birthday; and heaven forbid they are asking his girlfriend to be the one. Crass? Perhaps. A bit disrespectful in terms or her laying low and not being able to participate? Yes. \n\nI cannot, for the life of me, figure out where people are pulling the DANGER and RED FLAGS from this scenario. They are young guys trying to put together a fun weekend for their friend. They don\u2019t have it all figured out yet, and clearly they have no idea how this might land with a woman. (Typical dude-bro stuff). But it doesnt mean they plan on kidnapping , raping and murdering this woman. Where are the red flags? Show me one! \n\nI am well grown-up, thanks\u2014and part of getting there was no longer being afraid or overly concerned with every interaction and potential scenario. \n\nBe smart, ask questions, consider intent. Communicate upfront. Show others you are aware and not to be taken advantage of. Take control, and live life on your terms. And don\u2019t worry about your boyfriend\u2019s friends who want YOU to be his big surprise. Believe it or not, there\u2019s a bit of a good thing in there.", "And now we add in again the picture of OP popping out of a cake naked", "NAH. They are trying to do something awesome for a friend and you don't want to go on a trip and be alone. You might be a little prude but definitely not an AH.", "Bizarre. Do you jump out of a cake too? \n\nThis sounds like a weird 80s movie scene. Just say no thanks and enjoy the time to yourself for a days.", "NTA. The friends are disgusting. Talk to your bf. Yes ruin the surprise so he knows that his friends are being jerks to you.", "Your bfs friends are gross and i would tell him directly what theyre trying to get you to do  \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. His friends are dicks.", "nta what is wrong with people bro. If it\u2019s not ur thing don\u2019t go like wtf", "NTA and your boyfriend needs to be told about this. If he\u2019s not appalled by their behaviour he isn\u2019t the guy for you.", "NTA tell him", "NTA\n\n> his best friend has been guilting me by saying my boyfriend would want to see me on his birthday so I should do it for him\n\n\nWell, then why aren't you invited as a proper guest.\n\n>Another friend has also made unfunny jokes about how they would have to find a replacement gift if I didn\u2019t go. \n\nThis is very gross...", "It reminds me of Pucca\u2019s birthday when Garu was her present", "It's called a joke. Not everyone has a stick shoved up their ass", "\ud83c\udfc5 take my poor person award.", "So she's a nonhuman now? Lol Americans have some really weird ideas regarding sex. It's just sex.", "NTA. This is gross, and his friends are disgusting.", "NTA please tell your bf. How he reacts to this will tell you a whole lot.", "NTA \n\nThat is gross. Are they 12?", "NTA. Immediately tell your boyfriend and tell him how everything has made you feel. Gauge his reaction, and LEAVE HIM IF HE DOESNT DEFEND YOU!!!!", "Tell them if they have money to gamble and party then they have money to buy him a gift and to leave you out of their plans.", "Tell your bf everything and make it clear this treatment of you is unacceptable and a clear line I'm the sand. If this is the company your bf keeps, I can't imagine you'll get much sympathy but this is an opportunity for you to assess this relationship. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nIf they want to surprise him by bringing you along on the trip, why can\u2019t they stage the \u201creveal\u201d right at the beginning and include you in all of the trip? \n\nOh right, because they don\u2019t think of you as an actual person, just as a call girl they don\u2019t have to pay. Gross.", "NTA. I actually don't see anything wrong with \"Hey come on vacation with us and your BF, you'll get lots of alone time nudge nudge wink wink\" but the way they're going about it is pretty fucking crass. You want to show your BF this as well, especially the part that alludes to getting a random girl for his gift.", "Yta", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of replacement gift are they planning?  They are not treating you like a person. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if you are to spend a few days alone and without telling your bf, wouldn\u2019t he be worried about you and upset that you are not with him?", "Nta. Tell your so what his friends are saying", "NTA, and honestly, if I were you I would watch my back around them\n\nSomething about these guys sounds... Off...\n\nTell your boyfriend about it, and depending on his reaction, leave ASAP.\n\n And no matter what you do, *DO NOT GO ANYWHERE WITH THESE DUDES.*", "NTA. Honestly? Be petty. Blow the surprise. Tell your boyfriend his \u201cfriends\u201d are trying to get you to play call girl. They expect you to be alone the whole time??? Fuck em.", "NTA, and honestly, I'd be telling your boyfriend about those jokes, just in case they decide to pull it off. \n\nAnd please do not let yourself be convinced to go.", "I wonder if they are going to Vegas\u2026", "And why do they want her to tell no one she is going there?", "Wtf. This is gross. You\u2019re not a gift, let alone a gift for THEM to give. That\u2019s a lazy \u201cgift\u201d on their part but also creepy/pathetic. \u201cYoure gift is that we\u2019re gonna let you get laid\u201d. And it sounds like youre just supposed to hide out alone until they \u201cgive\u201d you?  What sorts of friends does your bf keep? You do know that although your bf isnt them, who you keep as friends does define you. Honestly, Id just tell your boyfriend about this.", "Nta..but you could always \"ruin\" the surprise.   Tell him.  Tell him what they want and what the \"alternative guess\" was and how uncomfortable you are.", "Am I stupid to be thinking of gang rape? \nPlease be careful OP", "NTA dude those aren\u2019t his \u201cfriends\u201d I would tell your boyfriend what they are saying to you and if he seriously doesn\u2019t see a problem with that at all I would leave him by the sounds of it to his friends think your just a object for sex and that\u2019s disgusting", "NTA. This feels icky at best and scary at worst. They want you to go off somewhere alone without telling anyone where you are? And then just wait around alone for a few DAYS? That sounds like the beginning of a Lifetime movie!", "NTA - If you don't feel comfortable with this, there's probably a really good reason. This is one invite you can, and probably should, decline.", "NTA your bfs friends are disgusting", "NTA, but I would record all of their suggestions and guilt tripping to later show them to your boyfriend.", "NTA and this is creepy as hell. If he also goes out for boys nights with them, I\u2019d also be wondering how many times they\u2019ve \u201cfound him a replacement\u201d if they\u2019re so willing to even make that comment to you like it\u2019s nothing. This whole thing is a giant red flag.", "I think it would have been fine if it was just a surprise that she was there, a surprise that would be revealed on the first day. But this gift thing where she has to hide for days and the comment about a replacement is just gross.", "NTA. This is gross. Tell your BF about it, explain your feelings and why you\u2019re uncomfortable, and explain how they keep trying to pressure you and don\u2019t respect your \u201cno.\u201d See how he responds\u2014if he\u2019s offended on your behalf or disgusted with their behavior, you\u2019re in the clear; but if he doesn\u2019t see the problem and blames you, then it\u2019s time to throw the whole kit and caboodle out", "NTA - his friends are childish and stupid. They need to break down and buy him a gift.", "NTA but i bet they find someone to strip for him. Id leave the entire group, i doubt your bf is honestly better if thats who he spends time with", "At first i thought how fucking cute it would be you were the gift. But like your PRESENCE like suprise we know youd miss her so shes coming on the trip. But this is super super disgusting.", "NTA and you would be better off explaining to your BF the entire \u201cbeing the BD present\u201d insult. Most likely your BF will understand how offensive the this is but If your BF fails to see how this is a horrible act of sexual objectification then you will have a better understanding of what the future holds if you stay together.", "Wtf this is 2022 right???? NTA, that\u2019s just gross and you shouldn\u2019t have to be objectified like that.", "Time to talk with your boyfriend about his friends' attitudes.", "The normal thing would be everyone to know except the boyfriend. God forbid something could happen to her there, and \u201cno one would know\u201d, not even her boyfriend.", " They want to treat her like a non human. She's his significant other not a prostitute."]}
