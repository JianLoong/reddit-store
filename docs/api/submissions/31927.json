I changed some details here for privacy reasons\u2026 just some details that don\u2019t really change the story. My (F33) mother\u2019s father is visiting us for a day. He was estranged from my maternal grandmother ever since he cheated on her and married his mistress. He moved to another city and basically left my mom, her siblings, and their mother to fend for themselves. He then had three more children with his second wife.\n\nDecades later, he has tried to reach out and seems way too eager to have a relationship with me despite not really being around much while I was growing up. He comments on my social media posts as if we\u2019re close. For the most part I just tolerated him since it was mostly harmless stuff anyway. \n\nI did however get quite upset with him a few weeks ago. You see, I am part of a theater group, which my grandfather knows about. One of my closest friends in the group recently passed away from a chronic illness. This really took a toll on me emotionally as he was so young and fought his illness bravely. I made a post about him the day he passed, and of course my grandfather just had to comment about how he\u2019d like me to sing for him when he visits.\n\nI saw red at that moment and just blocked him. To me, it was so insensitive and disrespectful of him to make my friend\u2019s death, which upset me so much, about him. It made me look back on all the things he did, such as demanding we book a nice hotel for him during his  visits, or force my mom to host his 2nd wife at her home, where my grandmother still lives. He keeps pushing his new family to blend into the family he abandoned, without even asking if that\u2019s what the first family wants. And until now I never made a single comment about him or complained. But what he did to me was the last straw.\n\nEarlier today my mom asked me if I would reconsider meeting with him. She said something along the lines of \u201che\u2019s getting old and maybe you won\u2019t get to see him again\u201d. I understand how she would feel the need to rebuild a relationship with her father, but I don\u2019t think I should have to be roped into it too. The guilt tripping around it makes me upset too. It\u2019s like my own feelings about what someone did to me suddenly aren\u2019t valid because of my mother\u2019s family issues. The thing is, while he is my mother\u2019s biological father, the man is a complete stranger to me.

I don't want to spend time with him and I don't want you to ask me about it again.\" If she continues to push, just repeat the phrase as needed. You don't need to discuss or argue about it, just hold firm.\n\nYou could also invite your mom to talk about her feelings in this situation; it might be helpful to her and you might gain some insights about her that you didn't know before.\n\nBear in mind that when a parent has behaved as your grandfather has, many times their children hope for apology or reconciliation as the parent ages. We all have an inner child that wishes for a parent's love, and once he's gone, it's too late, and that's a different type of grief. Not just for his passing, but for all the things you never got from them. Your mom has her own reasons for having him in her life, but that doesn't extend to you.

He sounds like an awful person, and there is no reason you should have to associate with awful people, relative or not.", "NTA. I would consider asking my mom what she needs from me. And I'd tell her I was doing so in order to support her. \"I don't care about your dad. But, I do care about you. So, tell me what you need so I can help you. Please don't frame this around the idea that I need to do something for him. That just puts me on the defensive and it isn't bringing me closer to you.\"", "Stop posting your lives on social media and this problem goes away. Stop putting your lives out there for strangers to infiltrate. NAH but you brought this on yourself. Its an epidemic at this point. It needs to stop.", "Very similar story in my family.\n\nMy grandfather left my grandmother then shacked up with a new woman while simultaneously basically forgetting about his kids and grandkids.\n\nWhatever. Shit happens.\n\nNow, the new wife is reaching out because she wants to mend fences before grandpa dies. She tries to weasel in on Facebook or whatever. I block her but my wife is too kind and doesn't understand the family dynamics, so she kinda indulges this strange woman.  Suddenly they want to send MY kids (their great grandkids) cards and shit.\n\nLike...wtf? You were literally absent for the last 40 years of my life. \n\nSo my message that has been conveyed is that grandpa can rot in the ground alone for all I care. I don't play into these emotional trappings just to satisfy a soul on their deathbed who made ZERO effort in healthy years to mend the relationship.\n\nThese old fuckers can piss up a rope for all I care. And I recommend YOU take the same stance. No \"feeling bad\" for them. Fuck family guilt. Let them lie in the bed they've made.", "Exactly this. It\u2019s already too big of a favor to even host him. Asking me to meet him and act like nothing happened is just pushing it.", "Thanks! I\u2019ve been thinking about this too. I want to support her. And I\u2019ve been there for her in many other instances regarding her father. I just really don\u2019t wanna have to be there this time. I\u2019m hurting now too, and I haven\u2019t had time to really grieve for my friend or even ask for support. I feel like the least people can do for me is to not push this.", "Tbh it doesn\u2019t matter. My mom actually did very well for herself despite their circumstances. My parents now have a fairly large house in a nice neighborhood which my grandfather seems really interested in. He keeps asking her how big the house is and if she has any famous neighbors. While my grandfather does live quite comfortably, it\u2019s safe to say nobody on our side is interested in whatever money he has to offer.", "That\u2019s true, I\u2019ve got to get a grip on my emotions or they\u2019ll be used against me here. I actually think the kindest thing I can do right now is to avoid. Thanks!", "I\u2019m slightly annoyed at my mother because she often complains about him but also doesn\u2019t know how to say no to him. I guess it\u2019s because her father left her at a very young age so she lowkey still wants to get his approval. I know it\u2019s not really her fault for feeling that way, but I have needs too. In fact, apart from the post I made about my friend\u2019s death, nobody ever saw me cry because I didn\u2019t wanna worry anybody with my issues.", "Thank you! I\u2019ve made up some excuse to not see him but my mom is kinda making me feel bad about it. I\u2019ve never really been particularly spiteful towards people and rarely hold grudges. But this seems like a situation to draw some boundaries.", "Yeah I wish more people understood this. In my culture we just are supposed to respect our elders regardless. But I personally can\u2019t fake a relationship with a person. I can be civil at best but I don\u2019t like the idea of forcing myself to forgive a person. It doesn\u2019t help anybody.", "Sadly there\u2019s not much I can do about my mother. She was abandoned at a very young age. I try my best to support her emotionally but this time I just can\u2019t.", "My guess is that OP sings, maybe in a choir, and sang at his friend's funeral. And now grandfather wants her to sing for him.", "I\u2019m part of a performing group. :) My grandfather knows this because I often post about it.", "You need a chance to grieve.  \n\nGood luck", "Then there's your answer... block him and ask the rest of the family to block him as well.  If he's invited to any family functions... make it clear that you won't be coming.  Make sure he's not invited or even aware of any more performances etc.", "Emotional Blackmail is Unacceptable and that is exactly what this is.  You are an adult and get to make choices...as he did... so You do what makes you comfortable...maybe a spa day \ud83d\ude09", "So the problem is he talked about it in the post about your friend dying? It seems not so bad, maybe just old people distraction. Still, if you don't like him, you don't owe him anything.", "I blocked him already. Didn\u2019t tell anyone else to because that\u2019s their choice. But for me, I didn\u2019t wanna upset myself any more by having him on my feed at all. Lucky social media sites don\u2019t tell you when you\u2019ve been blocked.", "Well to be fair, I did say I have to work tomorrow so I might not be able to see him anyway. I just didn\u2019t like how I\u2019m getting guilt tripped into it. Thanks for the advice!", "I posted about my friend dying and he just had to make a really inappropriate comment requesting me to sing for him. No condolences or anything. And of course all my friends see it too because he made the comment on a public post I made. \n\nIt\u2019s probably not the worst thing he\u2019s done tbh but I guess I was just tired of him making everything about him and his needs.", "Well, I would make it clear to your family not to expect you to show up to any functions where he is invited.", "And you were correct \ud83e\udd17 don't forget, Spa time is always good for clearing", "I will definitely do so if the time comes. Thankfully he lives quite far away and has yet to grace any of our family functions (mainly because my grandmother, his estranged ex-wife, is always in attendance).", "Great, that should be the most important thing to everyone, your Grandmother's wishes.  If she doesn't want him around or even contacting your family, people should respect that."]}
