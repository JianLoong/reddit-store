We never really spoke to Phil we just always thought he was nice because he would bring us stuff. \n\nFast forward I'm 28 and I've never had a proper conversation with Phil but now I'm stuck in a van with him and my dad for a couple of days for this job. \n\nSo as soon as Phil gets in the van he makes a joke about how he's not trying to touch my leg whilst getting his seat belt on but how he might do later, I awkward giggle and shrug it off. \nHe makes a few more odd comments about me being pretty and odd comments about warming up by cuddling me, I was feeling pretty uncomfortable by this but my dad wasn't saying anything so I didn't want to cause a scene, I had just never been spoken to this way from Phil before. \nI wasn't laughing at these comments anymore or even responding to them so I was getting more and more uncomfortable the more they happened. \n\nAfter a couple of hours of feeling grossed out and uncomfortable we get to site but we are early so we have to wait, at this point my dad says to Phil he stinks, he works on a farm so you can imagine the smell, this then leads eventually to my dad joking about when I was 4 months old having stinky nappies and having to change them and putting powder on my bits... I make it clear i am not comfortable talking about my baby bits around a 70 year old man and ask can we not talk about my bits in front of Phil to which he responds \"I don't mind, I'm just jealous\". I don't respond to this I'm just in shock \n\nMy dad laughs along with him and the conversation moves on to something else. For the rest of the day all I can think is how gross a 'joke' that was and how I don't want to be left alone with this man who I always thought was so nice.\n\nA few days go by and my dad calls me to ask if I want to come to another job, I explain that I'm only willing to come if Phil doesn't come along too, my dad is shocked by this and reiterates how great Phil is. I further explain how uncomfortable he made me feel and how hurt I am that my dad didn't say anything after he \"joked\" about being jealous of touching my 4 month old bits! \n\nMy dad told me I'm being stupid and I'm taking it the wrong way (not sure how else to take it) and that I shouldn't be dictating to him what he should do when he's doing me a favour by giving me a bit of work and that he's known Phil a lot longer than me and that he's a good guy.\n\nI understand that's his friend but I'm his daughter, is it unreasonable to ask that my dad defend me when his mate makes me feel so uncomfortable?", "created_utc": 1676035069, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yrrn5/aita_for_asking_my_dad_to_defend_me_from_his/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How can he even look at his friend and at himself anymore?!\n\nHis \"friend\" is a creep and the fact that your father tolerates his sexual harassment towards you speaks volumes. They\u2018re both predatory and disgusting.\n\nYou\u2018re by no means an AH, not in the slightest.", "You are NTA.  You need to stick to your guns here.  Good on you for acknowledging your discomfort and for speaking up about it. That takes courage.  His friend is being very creepy and inappropriate.  If your dad won't be more supportive I hope you have someone else in your family that you can tell about this.   Unfortunately you may have to give your dad an ultimatum that extends to him as well as his friend if he won't back you up on this.  Please never act polite to men behaving this way towards you.  You're doing great with this so far.  Back yourself.  You're right and they're wrong.", "NTA - I felt dirty reading this.  I don't have any kids, but sounds like your father is an ah for enabling this type of talk.  Doesn't matter if he was joking or not (even if he was joking that was a horrible joke...who jokes about 'baby bits' and being jealous they didn't get to see), you felt uneasy and your father should have stuck up for you.  I'm sorry you had to put up with something like that...I can just seem them as passing it off as 'It's just how we joke around' or 'It's ok, he's a family friend.'  No, no it's not OK!", "Yo WTF? This is all kinds of gross. \n\nNTA\n\nHow the hell can you make inappropriate jokes and comments about a friends daughter and your dad is okay with it? I\u2019m cringing for you", "NTA.  Phil is being the stereotypical creepy family friend. Your dad needs to get a clue and stand up for you.", "Your dad is the AH for sure and so is that creep. Context clues makes me think that your dad and this Phil guy has some inside pervy things about you. They probably have conversations about you in private. \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2eJust by the sheer lack of concern. That would be the only thing that explains it in my eyes.", "NTA, and no, not unreasonable at all. \n\n> \"I don't mind, I'm just jealous\". I don't respond to this I'm just in shock My dad laughs along with him\n\nThis made my skin crawl. Absolutely vile and disgusting. \n\nRespectfully, I've gone NC for similar comments from family members. That your dad then got *angry* with you when you called him out should tell you everything you need to know about him. \n\nWhat disgusting, awful people. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. The fact that this is a job site and obviously sexual harassment is bad enough, but that your own father is engaging in it is stomach turning.", "Ask your dad what way you are supposed to take his friend making sexual jokes about being jealous he didn't get to touch you as a four month old baby. Ask why that is ok. \n\nYour dad's friend is gross but the really sad part here is that your father laughed. He did worse than nothing. His friend should have been shut down immediately. Instead your father is surprised by your reaction. Makes me wonder about the sorts of comments he makes if he thinks his mate's conduct is anything short of disgraceful. NTA.", "NTA. Your father is a big an AH as Phil. I would stay away from both of them.", "NTA but my god your father is. Phil is a fucking pervert and your father should've dealt with it.", "NTA.  Phil is a pervert and your father enabled him.", "NTA.  Your dad AND Phil are disgusting.", "Your dad has made his choice. Creepy Phil over you.

Your dad sounds a little gross too and, frankly, niave.  Has no one ever seen the documentaries about how the perp was \"such a good friend and we NEVER thought he'd do that.\"    Good for you for saying no if Phil was there.", "\nNTA. Please don't go on site again if he's there.\nI'm sorry your Dad did not make you feel protected and safe, especially when you voiced your concerns. I know my Dad's blood would have been boiling if any of his friends tried to treat me that way.", "Funny (not funny) that this is the exact situation people use to try to explain to someone when they're being sexist or creepy. \"How would you feel if someone treated your daughter that way??\" Apparently if you yourself are sexist and creepy enough, you feel A-OK.\n\nNTA, OP. But unfortunately it looks like your dad is choosing his creepy friend over you. I'm sorry you have to choose between being harassed and having no work.
