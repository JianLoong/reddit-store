So we decided to do our classic \"invite someone we don't know to see if they'll vibe with our group\"\n\nOn Thanksgiving day, I found out one of the \"new people\" one of my friends invited was an ex of mine. I knew they were still friends and it doesn't really bother me, what they do on their time isn't my business so I didn't mind it, but me and him had gone NC bc we had a horrible breakup and honestly didn't want to see each other ever again. \n\nI didn't want this to be our way of seeing each other again, and I definitely didn't want any drama from either of us, so I told my friends and the person I invited that I wouldn't be coming to avoid drama. Apparently just declining to show up was drama enough. 2 of 3 of my close friends (one couldn't come) said I was being irrational and petty by not putting aside our past differences for the night and just be thankful.\n\nWell apparently he passed the vibe check in my absence, because I was also told that they plan to invite him to our Friends-mas (already WIP) and maybe some casual hangouts. I told them as long as he'll be at events, they can count me out. It's a choice we mutually made in the past and I'm not going to change it just for them.\n\nI'd hate that he could be the thing that makes me lose my friend group, but it's like they're choosing him over me, and it kind of sucks.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I appreciate people finally telling me it's time to leave the flock. We've been friends since highschool, and since we're all kind of antisocial freaks (just joking), we've all stayed together just to have friends/ a support system. But they're obviously not friends anymore. Adulthood has changed things.

It happens, especially after high school.", "NTA. But your \u201cfriends\u201d are. Friends should respect you more than that.", "NTA. Your friends are being pretty rude, both with choosing your ex over you, and for telling you to just get over it, especially when it was a mutual decision between you and your ex to never see each other again. Maybe you should invite all their ex partners to events and see how they like it.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your choice entirely, that's the beauty of being an adult, simply not ever seeing people you don't like. It is kinda shitty how dismissive your friends were about it though, do one of your friends \"like\" him?\n\nHowever just as easily as you are excluding yourself, you could turn up and either try to hash it out or just don't directly engage with him, and if it don't work out or he's a dick about burying the hatchet then hey fuck it, at least you tried. Depending how long ago your breakup was will probably be a determining factor in this though and how much both have you grown since.", "NTA\n\nYou're not confused. This member of the friend group is choosing your ex over you. And the rest of the group seems content to let this happen.\n\nAnd the 'vibe' thing is BS because he doesn't pass that test with you and the rest of the group doesn't care. \n\nThe group has made it clear that they are going to be inconsiderate of your feelings.\n\nYour move.", "It\u2019s your life, do what you want.

They can pick and choose who they hang out with, and they did.\n\nExample - I recently got divorced. I told my parents they can choose to continue to speak to my ex or not, but if they do, they are not allowed to tell me about their conversations. I don't need to hear about him for many reasons. If I found out that they chose to invite him for Xmas, I would not attend. They can either invite him or not. Their choice. It is my choice to attend or not from there.

Well, your friend group is being dismissive of your feelings, and frankly, that's odd.", "She's literally invited and choosing not to go. Therm choosing would be banning one of them from attending.

You deserve Friend\u2019s who respect your boundaries.  There are a lot of great people out there, just give it time though because making friends as an adult is hard! \n\nAlso, honestly, I\u2019m confused as to why your ex (who knows your friend group) is choosing to participate when this breakup was so awful! He and the friend who invited him are AH for inserting him when they are aware of your feelings.", "If you are saying 'I have bad blood with this person and if he's around I won't be' and your 'friends' are still choosing to invite him, they're choosing him.
