She was also in foster care for 6 months before living with us. \n\nWe have a 4 bedroom house and there's me (14f), my brother (16m), my sister (17f) and my parents so there wasn't an extra room for her. We're converting our old playroom to a bedroom but until that happens she's sleeping in my room because we're closest in age. \n\nSharing a room with my cousin is exhausting. She refuses to leave the room for anything after my mom tucks her in until my mom comes to get her so if she's hungry, scared, needs to go to the bathroom, feeling sick, etc. she always wakes me up then I have to get my mom so my mom can take care of it. She also randomly hides under her bed and cries so I always have to drop what I'm doing to get my mom to take care of that too. \n\nThe other night she woke me up because she wanted my mom. She could've gotten her herself but she always insists on waking me up and asking me to get her. I got my mom because she could've cried all night if I didn't then the next morning I said it should be someone else's turn to share with her until her room is ready and that I'm sick of being woken up because she's scared to leave her room after bedtime. My dad said that her room should be ready soon and they're not moving her to another room. I said it's bullshit that they're making me babysit their niece all night and my dad threatened to ground me if I didn't shut up. \n\nAITA for saying somebody else needs to share a room with her?", "created_utc": 1699932629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ut7oi/aita_for_telling_my_mom_it_needs_to_be_someone/", "score": 333, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is she in therapy, if not, she should be. It\u2019s unfair that your parents have put you in the position of being a support person for this child when you are not qualified to do so. They are ignoring the stress your cousins situation is putting on you. Perhaps you can suggest they get a baby monitor or walkie talkie for your cousin to contact you mom directly. She will need that when she\u2019s in her own room.", "NTA\n\n> We're converting our old playroom to a bedroom but until that happens she's sleeping in my room because we're closest in age. \n\n> My dad said that her room should be ready soon and they're not moving her to another room.\n\n**How the hell** is this taking *any* time at all?\n\nHow to convert a playroom to a bedroom:\n\n1. Set up a bed.\n\nYou're done!", "NAH, but this kid clearly has been traumatized and needs one of those audio baby monitors so she can wake up your mom without using you or anyone else as an intermediary.", "Why wasn\u2019t the solution for you to share with your sister for the time being, while cousin gets their own room? NTA, but I\u2019m side-eyeing your parents who clearly did not prepare well enough to take in this kid, or at the least didn\u2019t brief their own kids well enough on what to expect", "Two words .... Baby monitor. She can call for your mom herself. NTA!", "NTA, it's not fair your parents are putting the burden solely on you. Your dad is especially the AH when he basically told you \"shut up and deal with the consequences of my actions.\" If she doesn't get tucked in, will she think it's not bed time and be able to leave the room any time during the night?", "\n\n\nAnyone suggest you share with your sister and cousin gets the room yet?", "Just wanted to say I\u2019m so sorry :( your parents need to prioritize you too.", "NTA\n\nHow about you suggest setting up some way for her to call your mom directly without waking you up? Maybe a walkie talkie or leaving you homes telephone next to her bed so she can call your mom\u2019s cellphone?\n\nI totally understand how this is interfering with your sleep, but she needs your mom\u2019s support so it\u2019s better to find a way she can get that without it being so much load on you.", "NTA.  I think it sounds like your cousin has some sort of issues that might require therapy and putting that on you to deal with is not fair or right.  I\u2019m not a therapist but I\u2019m willing to bet, things are somehow going to be worse once your cousin is in her own room.  Maybe try speaking to your parents highlighting that your cousins behavior is not normal?  I know it sounds like an odd suggestion but try asking one of your siblings if you can sleep in their room for a night or 2 but go to their room after your parents have gone to bed OR go sleep on a couch.  Somehow create a situation that\u2019s going to leave your cousin in the room alone.  See what happens\u2026I think the reaction by your cousin will be negative in a way your parents are finally going to have to stop ignoring the problem and get your cousin help.", "NTA but your parents are. They shouldn't be putting this kind of responsibility on you, your cousin obviously has some kind of trauma. That's not something a 14yo should be handling.", "NAH, i do see how this is exhausting. What even happened to her? She sounds quite traumatized and is being clingy because of it, not much you can do about that tbh besides what you did and waiting it out", "NTA.  Your mom needs to teach your cousin to go to her if she needs something in the night, with consequences if necessary.  \n\nWhy can't you and your older sister share a room for a bit?  That seems to be a better option than anyone sharing with your cousin.", "NTA can you go and sleep with your brother until her bedroom is ready. At 14 year old a good sleep night is necessary for your body.", "NAH, but I agree with the voice activated monitor.  If she won\u2019t use it, you can.  She\u2019ll still wake you up but at least you won\u2019t get even more awake by getting physically out of your bed.  \n\nI completely get your frustration, but try not to resent your parents too much.  It sounds like they chose the most workable solution they had short of tossing her back in the non-family foster care pool.\n\nCan your mother sleep on a cot or air mattress in the hall outside of your room a few times a week to lessen being woken up?", "NAH. This is a tough situation. This child is experiencing the effects of trauma, and the foster system definitely didn\u2019t help. She sees you as a comfort and someone she can trust which is amazing, but I understand how annoying and frustrating it would be with this big change. Try to hold out until her room is finished. Sleep on the couch or ask your sister to let you camp in her room on the floor if you aren\u2019t getting sufficient sleep. Arm your cousin with a flashlight and bottle of water at bedtime to try to soothe her fears and avoid needing to get up for water. \n\nYour parents are kinda AHs for not understanding where you are coming from, but it\u2019s likely also stressful for them financially and emotionally for whatever caused this situation. Her new room will be ready before you know it.", "NAH\n\nI see your point, but your parents are creating a solution and the current set up is basically the only allowable option by CPS rules.\n\n10 and 17 is too much of a gap to be allowed.\n\nYour brother is too old and male.\n\nYour parents are too old.\n\nYou could room with your sister?\n\nBut unfortunately there\u2019s a heavily traumatised little kid in the middle and at the moment your room is the only option.\n\nIt sucks, but moving her multiple times will just compound her trauma, and her room is nearly done.\n\nHang in there.", "NTA. Your cousin has been through a lot but that doesn't mean that the world revolves around her. Sit down with your parents and tell them how this is making you feel. Don't fuss or yell, just tell them honestly how this is making you feel. Once they know, it might help them understand better.\n\nThen they need to talk with your cousin and make her understand that it isn't right to keep waking you up. That she needs to be considerate of your needs too, not just her own. She might be young but she's old enough to understand that much.", "NTA. They are putting way too much on you. Are you able to sleep with ear plugs in? Or go sleep in the couch? Or just pretend to sleep through her crying for a few nights.", "NTA \n\nSounds like she needs to be sharing a room with your mom.", "NTA, just sleep on the couch at night.", "NTA but you parents are", "OP YOU NEED TO LET YOUR PARENTS READ THIS THREAD. ASAP.", "NTA. You're being parentified and are losing sleep because your parents are abdication their responsibility.\n\nSleep deprivation is a torture technique.\n\nYou're being abused.\n\nTalk to a school counselor about this.", "I would only ever do this if I was getting paid for it. This is like a job and not one you signed up for every night when you should be sleeping.  And with the way she is, I\u2019m a little worried that they\u2019re not even planning to move her because they\u2019re worried to leave her alone.  Regardless, your parents are being assholes hardcore, having to deal with this at 14 can seriously affect you for the rest of your life and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re parents are taking that or you or the entire situation seriously enough at all.  I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going through some stuff too with whatever\u2019s going on, but you are 14 and they should most definitely be more considerate.", "NAH. Depending on the agreement of your parents taking her in, it's possible that legally she cannot share a room with your older siblings because of the age gaps or in the case of your brother their gender. And you don't know if there was any sort of situation which instilled this sort of fear of leaving the room in the middle of the night by her previous living arrangements. She might have been beaten for doing so and needs someone to show her it's okay. It's possible she has a lot of trauma. Granted it's not on you take care of that trauma, but your situation is temporary. It will get better.", "Nah but what trauma did the niece experience that led her to foster care. So that means in 6 months she went from her parents or primary Care to foster care to your house. She had crazy rules most likely and was not allowed to leave her room. Yes it's a little annoying that she wakes you up. But a little empathy could be nice and maybe try talking to her and see if you can help her leave the room.\n\nYes it's annoying but look at it from her point of view, remove from a parent, removed from Foster Care and now the house she's in now the person she's living with doesn't want her there either, how much rejection should a little girl take just to make you more comfortable.", "NTA. \n\nWalkie Talkie for her, earplugs for you", "NAH it's a shit situation for everyone and at your age you shouldn't be expected to deal with it as well as all adult who has signed up for this. I've been in similar situations and it work out better if you find somewhere else to sleep instead of insisting they move the guest.", "Do you have a phone that she can use to call your mom at night instead of waking you up?", "NTA but could you share the room with your older sister instead?\nShe'll have a room for herself and you could sleep until the end of the construction.", "NAH and this is way beyond Reddit's pay grade. That's one hell of a traumatized kid and obviously needs loads of professional help. I get that your parents are in a tight situation, but they should make sure you get enough sleep. Sleep is the most important thing for a kid your age, and also you'll end up resenting your cousin when she keeps you awake. \n\nYou're certainly not an AH, but I think your parents aren't really trying to parentify you on purpose here instead of being stressed out by the situation and can't think of better solutions.\n\nDo anything you can to get the sleep you need. Earplugs, sleeping in your sister's room or anything you might come up with. I really feel for your cousin, but her trauma doesn't justify depriving you of sleep.", "How long until the other room is ready? You should have more sympathy for her, even if you have to go wake up your mom. She's only 10 and had a shitty life before this. I know it sucks, but you should really try to be a good friend for her. Can you secretly sleep on a couch somewhere else instead?", "You\u2019re NTA, for expressing yourself, and how the situation is impacting you too. \nYour cousin is having a trauma reaction to something from what happened to her overnight, either in her home or foster care. \n\nWork with her; don\u2019t you alone go get your mum for help. \nGrab a torch, turn it on, and give it to her, tell her to hold your hand, and together you\u2019ll go get your mum.\nKeep repeating it, one day it will stop because she\u2019s more comfortable, or because she has her own room. \n\nIf it\u2019s hard for you, it\u2019s hard for her, it\u2019s not going to get better unless you work together.", "NAH but you are being negatively impacted by her actions. Sleep is important. You are not in charge of managing her trauma. Next time she wakes you up to get your mom, maybe just leave and sleep on a couch. Also do a little research because most fostering agencies have strict sleeping arrangements. Room sharing with anyone but a sibling is often not allowed.  ETA: If it gets bad enough, you can warn your parents that you will talk with the CPS rep about the situation when they do a check in. I would avoid actually doing so other than as a last resort, but sleep really is important. I understand she is traumatized, but your family was clearly not ready to take her in yet and did so at your expense.", "Nta, but try to be patient with her. It sounds like things have been very rough for her. Maybe share with her some things that comfort you. I know it sucks that you have to deal with this, but remember, she is going through a lot, too. I recommend on weekends or something finding  ways to encourage her to leave the room without your mom. For instance, \"Hey cousin, if you're awake, I'm going to get a snack. You can come with me.\" I hope everything goes well", "NTA but boarding YTA if you talk about her when she can hear you. She\u2019s obviously been through a traumatic experience\u2026 things you probably can\u2019t even imagine\u2026. and the tension coming off you won\u2019t help. Will probably make it worse. I feel so horrible for her.", "You\u2019re NTA.  The cousin is NTA.  But your parents suck.  Setting up a room takes a day or two - even if it\u2019s filled to the brim. Empty it, add bed. \n\nBut if she\u2019s alone and won\u2019t leave the room who will she ask for help when she wakes up? That\u2019s another reason your parents are really the assholes. They must know this.", "Eh, I\u2019m a little bit in between with this one. You are lacking any empathy for the trauma she has been through. She was locked in a room and not allowed out. She is terrified to wake an adult because she probably got abused for it in the past. A 14 yr old is less intimidating than an adult. \n  It\u2019s not fair that you\u2019re not getting sleep, that\u2019s a lot to put on you. You should be sharing a room with your older sister while your cousins room is done. That\u2019s the only solution that makes sense right now if you\u2019re needing a break. \n  She will continue to be traumatized for a long time which is extremely sad. I understand it sucks for you, but man look at how much she has been through at only 10 years old. She was so abused she hides under the bed crying.", "Move your things into the playroom and sleep there.", "Nta", "NTA but it sounds like your cousin experienced A LOT of trauma in her past. I know it isn\u2019t you\u2019re problem and in a perfect world she\u2019d have a room already, but its not. Try your best to give her a little grace. I saw in another comment she used to be locked in her room by foster parents, and obviously she\u2019s not with her bio parents anymore. Your cousin has been abused and abandoned by everyone that she has ever known. Again it\u2019s not the job of a 14 year old to fix it, and you\u2019re not wrong in wanting your own space. But if you\u2019re going to have those discussions with your parents maybe shield her from it if possible. She probably feels like a huge burden already. Wishing you the best of luck and the both of you a quick resolution so you get your own space.", "I know you may not fully understand but clearly she\u2019s been thru a lot.  I know it\u2019s never easy to deal with having family stay with you but at the same time, think about what she\u2019s been thru.  If she\u2019s been in Foster care, I can assure you it\u2019s not for a good reason here I\u2019m guessing (and you don\u2019t need to share why).  But honestly, it can be traumatizing to be 10 and not be living with your family for whatever reason she\u2019s in the foster care system.\n\nI get you\u2019re frustrated and understand why you are, but at the same time, think about what things might be if you were in her shoes and you were being moved around home wise and didn\u2019t have the same family you do now of your siblings and parents to care for you the way they do.  It may seem needy but in reality, it\u2019s her way of crying out that she\u2019s having issues.  Perhaps a talk with mom might uncover that she needs some therapy and help to calm her down a bit as well.  Maybe talking with her might ease some of her fears and concerns because clearly she has some and maybe she might be able to connect with you a bit better if she sees you\u2019re not just always complaining or being the cousin who seems to want to be away from her more than anything else.\n\nJust a thought\u2026", "NTA your not an AH, but your parents won't do what you want regardless of what the reddit says.  since your mom has to get up anyway, tell your mom to a toy walkie-talkie for your cousin. Then, your cousin can get your mom herself without leaving the room.", "NTA.  A few potential options.  \n\nCan you move in with your older sister for a short while?  Can they get your cousin a phone or a walkie talkie for her to contact your mom without waking. You?  Meantime you would wear noise canceling headphones?", "N A H. Your cousin is experiencing a high level of trauma. I feel sorry for her and everyone involved. It takes a lot for a child to be put in foster care, so just think about that and what it means to your cousin. Right now, your cousin needs to feel loved and that she's in a secure place. She can't sleep with your parents because CPS  won't allow it. You're the closest in age, and while you didn't ask for this, this is an opportunity to think beyond yourself and your immediate frustrations/stress. I know that's hard to think about at 14. I'm 35 and I've experienced a lot in my short life. One thing that I'm grateful for now is having those stressful experiences where I (and my brothers) had to deal with extraordinary life situations. It taught us valuable things like true humility, empathy, prioritization, placing family first, etc.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is this: your situation is an unfortunate one. Your cousin's is an even bigger one. While this situation is stressful for you, and your feelings are understandable, please try to think beyond yourself and your immediate needs. What you're going through is only temporary until the room is ready. The scarring she has is deep, and the she needs is warmth, love, and security.", "It's a little bit rough, but you can use headphones and ignore her. She will have no choise and go for mother by herself.", "NTA.  Can you go sleep on the living room/family room sofa?", "YTA but a soft one. I get that it\u2019s annoying but she\u2019s like this for a reason. If this was permanent I would be on your side but since this is temporary try to be a little more understanding. I\u2019m sure she was put in foster care for a reason and maybe wasn\u2019t in the best home. She could have been molested, beaten, or abused in other ways and this fear is completely natural.", "Your 10-yo cousin is likely traumatized by whatever she was taken into foster care for, and then further traumatized just by being in the system. She's got a lot going on, and she probably can't help how she acts at this time. Changing rooms multiple times will probably make her behavior worse.  Hopefully, your parents have her in therapy.  \n\nAs you're the youngest of your family, you sharing a room is just the way it goes. \n\nSo yes, in what is probably going to be a massively downvoted verdict, YTA. Perhaps you could be grateful that you were not removed from your nuclear family, put into foster care for half a year, and then forced to share a room with a cousin who doesn't want you.", "YTA because you don\u2019t want to compromise. It\u2019s temporary. You could sleep with your sister. You could sleep in the lounge or in the room \u201cin construction\u201d for a few days. In truth you want *your room* and you want it alone. \nIt\u2019s absolutely fine to want a good night sleep and it\u2019s also absolutely understandable to not want to babysit. But you have options, and you\u2019re not taking them, focusing on \u201cmy other siblings can do it!\u201d (When clearly there\u2019s a reason why your parents haven\u2019t allowed it, either legal or practical.)\nThat said it\u2019s a bad situation and I feel a little for you. I was used as a forced babysitter for ten years. It sucked. But basically your cousin\u2019s situation is a lot worse than yours and you\u2019re so focused on resenting her for taking your space that you can\u2019t seem to feel much empathy for the poor kid.  \nSo yes, YTA. And so is your father for speaking to you like that when you made your frustration clear. But you\u2019re not looking for solutions, just validation. \nThe only innocent here is the poor traumatized kid.", "YTA, poor thing suffered enough, you should make her feel like home instead of writing about her online.", "Soft YTA because you're only a kid that doesn't really understand anything yet.\n\nShe's scared, you say she refuses to do anything to wake your mom up, don't you think that has a reason? She's probably traumatised because of something that happened in the past, maybe her mom/foster mom would hit her or screamed at her or even worse if she woke her up and feels like you are a safe person to ask that to.\n\nYes, it sucks that you have to put up with it but it's temporary and the best for her, because you're closer in age to her, she feels safer with you, she can tell you things without being scared, so put up with it because she needs you, you can't even begin to understand what she has been through, give her a pass.\n\nIf this was indefinitely I'd say otherwise because you need your rest, you're just a kid, but it's not, so just be there for her for a while.", "I don't know if you told your parents that \"it's bullshit that they're making [you] babysit their niece all night\" in front of your cousin or not. If she was present, then YTA. And your dad probably told you to shut up because he needed you to stop talking like that in front of her *now*. If she wasn't present, then he's TA. He should have explained to you why she needs to share your room.\n\nIt sounds like legally she has to have a proper bedroom, can't share with your parents/mom, probably can't share with your brother, and your parents might have a good reason she can't share with your sister (maybe she's too old per CPS? Or maybe they think your sister is less able to afford a bad nights sleep than you are?) I always try to explain to my kids my reasoning for why I do the things I do - even at a young age, they respond much better to explanations than they do to \"because I said so.\"\n\nThe whole situation obviously sucks. I'm sure your parents are under a lot of stress over the entire situation. As much as I love my niece and nephews, adding a kid to the family is a huge deal and your parents are probably going through a lot of expenses (financially and emotionally) that they didn't necessarily choose.\n\nAlso, I saw in the comments that your cousin won't use a device to communicate with your mom at night? Once your cousin's room is ready, how do they plan to have her let your mom know she needs help at night? Baby monitor?", "NTA. They need to set up a room fast for her. Also they need to set up a monitor. Not one with a camera cause of her age and perhaps past trama. Also remember to keeping being kind to her. It is not her fault she is reacting how she us.", "I like the baby monitor idea. That\u2019s genius. You might wake up but if you don\u2019t t have to get out of bed you may be able to fall back asleep easier. I feel sorry for you honey and I also feel sorry for your cousin. How scary this must be for her. I wish the best for both of you. NTA", "Well your NTA but dang I feel for that kid. Imagine one day you wake up and everything you know is gone. You spend 6 months living in strangers homes then get put into a room with someone who sees you as a burden. My heart breaks for her. \n\nThat she is hiding under the bed and afraid to get out of her bed in the night is just so sad. What has that poor child be through. She is clearly heavily traumatized by what she has experienced. \n\nWhy dont you ask if you can sleep in the old play room for now. Yes, they are working on it but if a bed was moved in there, you could sleep there but not actually move out of your room.", "YTA.. This kid clearly went through severe, severe abuse/trauma. Suck it up and deal with it til her room is ready. Dear Jesus, this is your family.", "YTA, every think you ask what got your cousin in that situation?! It sounds like  an enormous amount of trauma this girl went through to be scared to leave her room. Maybe it\u2019s just me and maybe I\u2019m wrong about this but since your closer to her age why don\u2019t you ask her what she\u2019s been through", "It is what it is. Sometimes things are a bummer. This is one of those things.\n\nBetter than being in foster care though. Try to talk to your parents, but I had to share a small room with two of my sisters for a bit - but it is what it is", "YTA. You could try having some grace & compassion for your own cousin. You don't know what she's been through to be so scared & all you're going through is losing a little sleep. We took in my little cousin & I had to share my own bed with her for over a year & I was glad to do it. Think how you would feel if it was you & your parents weren't there for you.

But sounds like it will get better", "Sorry but you sound absolutely like a heartless narcissist. There will be time in your life when you will need empathy, care and understanding from people and you know carma is a bitch. Pull yourself together and be the person who makes a difference in someone's life. You can even start right now with the girl. She might relax and sleep better if she knows now you dont hate her.

She was also in foster care for 6 months before living with us. \n\nWe have a 4 bedroom house and there's me (14f), my brother (16m), my sister (17f) and my parents so there wasn't an extra room for her. We're converting our old playroom to a bedroom but until that happens she's sleeping in my room because we're closest in age. \n\nSharing a room with my cousin is exhausting. She refuses to leave the room for anything after my mom tucks her in until my mom comes to get her so if she's hungry, scared, needs to go to the bathroom, feeling sick, etc. she always wakes me up then I have to get my mom so my mom can take care of it. She also randomly hides under her bed and cries so I always have to drop what I'm doing to get my mom to take care of that too. \n\nThe other night she woke me up because she wanted my mom. She could've gotten her herself but she always insists on waking me up and asking me to get her. I got my mom because she could've cried all night if I didn't then the next morning I said it should be someone else's turn to share with her until her room is ready and that I'm sick of being woken up because she's scared to leave her room after bedtime. My dad said that her room should be ready soon and they're not moving her to another room. I said it's bullshit that they're making me babysit their niece all night and my dad threatened to ground me if I didn't shut up. \n\nAITA for saying somebody else needs to share a room with her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You need to work with the therapist to try and resolve the issue of not being able to leave after 8:30 if she needs something because she will be alone. She needs to be helped through being able to use communication devices or being able to be independent because that trauma will be reinforced when she is alone again.\n\nShe has two people she can trust right now, which is you and your Mom.

I would do it all without saying a word to mom and dad. Then once it is all done, what are they gonna do? Ground you? Better than sleeping with a traumatized child, who needs and adult watching over her not a teenage girl. They are not caring about how this is effecting you and it\u2019s horrible parenting.

Still not fair to you but kinda understandable.", "I think it\u2019s worth pointing out to your parents that they need to figure out a solution so she can use a baby monitor or a flip phone to call them if she is too anxious to leave the room at night. Right now, they\u2019re kicking the can down the road on that even though she\u2019s going to have to be able to when she has her own room.\n\nThey might be more likely to listen if you tell them you want to work with them to get her to a point where that\u2019s solved before she gets her room or she\u2019s going to have a hard time transitioning to it. If they think she should just stay in your room, it might help to tell them that you\u2019re not ready for the responsibility of being a second parent at night for the long-term and you worry you\u2019ll grow to resent her, which you don\u2019t want for her. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have more responsibility for your cousin than you\u2019re ready for (which is fair for your age). It sounds like everyone is in a tough spot but that doesn\u2019t mean you and your ability to sleep aren\u2019t important. If this issue hasn\u2019t been brought up with her therapist (I assume/hope she has one based on how unstable and frightening her childhood has been), it should be something to work on with professional guidance. Overall, if you can frame the issue in a way that benefits your cousin more than you, your parents are more likely to respond (I\u2019m not saying you should have to do this but since your parents are in triage mode, they may be more likely to see your point that way).", "what do you mean she wouldn't use it that's not who baby monitors work?", "Could you move in with your 17 year old sister in the mean time? Just to get peace and quiet?\n\nI feel bad for your cousin but also for you. Your parents need to come up with another method and explain, ideally in therapy, that your cousin can\u2019t keep waking you up. I like the baby monitor idea. I also think you should look into ear plugs or something. Explain to your mom and cousin you need your sleep too", "Does your mom not hear her crying on the baby monitor? I thought they were supposed to wake parents up for crying", "Or they could have thought it would be better to have the youngest in the house room together while the oldest get their own room. That's pretty standard in a lot of households where the number of children outnumber bedrooms. \n\nSeems like this family could really benefit from a family conversation about their set up tho. Unless there's an issue with the two sisters rooming together, that seems like the best option for now.", "If she won't use it, you can, rather than getting up to go get your mom.", "If you're not there (even sleeping on the couch) then what will she do?  When she has her own room, you won't be there to wake up.  Better she starts learning now.", "What happens if you sleep on the couch or stay at a friends??", "She chose to take the burden on.  The OP did not.", "OP is a child. Her mother is an adult who chose to take on this responsibility.

Yes this is getting in the way of your sleep but this is something she can\u2019t help.\n\nShe was taken from her family for unknown reasons. She was then put with a family that abused her even worse.  I don\u2019t want to scare you but I do want you to see the world through her eyes right now. \n\nImagine if you were taken from your family by someone you didn\u2019t know. The people who you were with now claim to be your new family.  If you didn\u2019t do what they said when they said it you got hit or even threats to unalive you.  The people throw you in a small room and lock it every night.  You are forbidden from leaving the room even to use restroom.  If you end up wetting yourself you got more physical abuse.\n\n\nAgain I don\u2019t want to scare you.  This is sadly the reality that your cousin faced.  Your mom is the first safe adult in her life. It\u2019s not something that can disappear overnight.  Please don\u2019t take your anger out on her.  She isn\u2019t doing this to hurt you.  She is still trying to adjust to a world where she is safe.", "Honey you can use the baby monitor to alert your parents. The fact that they are using you as a baby sitter is alarming.", "This is why she will not leave the room. \n\nI know this probably sounds crazy and right now you seem frustrated, so you probably dont give a dang but this child has actually given you the only thing she has to give, the most valuable thing she has. Trust. She trusts you enough to wake you up and ask for help. She does not trust others enough to do that yet, only you. \n\nAs a former foster kid, I cant tell you how hard it is to give trust to another person.", "So she lived in fear, \n\nand now you are blaming her for it\n\nLets hope you never have to be that child who lives in fear", "I have read the comments.  Consequences do not have to always be punishment.

If earplugs are uncomfortable can you try another brand? Or wear noise cancelling headphones ? What about a white noise machine? \n\nCan you share a room with your sister instead ?\n\nPutting up with the energetic dog on the couch for a few nights might be worth it to prove to your parents their current plan isn\u2019t working, or can the dog be gated into another room?", "Maybe your mom could try a baby monitor so she can hear if your cousin wakes up?

You would make this mistake I see", "Taking care of a traumatized child (only 4 years younger than you) throughout all hours of the night is not just \u201closing sleep.\u201d It would be a different story if her cousin didn\u2019t clearly need extra care or if OP had volunteered the caretaking role, but she clearly didn\u2019t, and it is being forced on her in some of the most crucial hours (sleep) during a humans developmental stage.

That behavior won't change when the room is finished. Since the current work around is that OP is used to go get her mom, it's not unlikely that OP will be asked/forced to continue sharing a room. Should that happen, then it's not a minor and temporary inconvenience anymore. \n\n\nI hope the behavior improves with time and therapy.

It doesn't matter if it sounds like whining or yelling. They need to focus on what point she's making, not how she delivers it. What's worse is that they won't even let her stay at a friend's house, while all of this is going on. This is the sort of thing that makes adults limit or refuse all contact with their parents. This isn't even all that recent. She's been dealing with this for nearly a year.   \n\n\nI advised OP to get another adult involved.

If OP was the solution to these problems then fine but all she\u2019s doing is waking up the mom who is waking up just as much as OP and actually handling the situations.", "OP did not ask to move in with her sister and would most likely complain about that too.

Not following them may also put their own children at risk (or at least they may be scared it will).

Or that because it's not constant that it doesn't count? If it was limited to a week, then sure, but water dripping on a stone will wear it away the same way water streaming over it does. One just destroys the stone faster. No one is saying the 10yo is doing any of this on purpose, but this is bad for OP's health and it's not sustainable. The parents need to figure out a solution that doesn't involve OP's continuing to deal with this for months.  And adults need on average 2-3 hours less sleep than a 14yo, so yes the same sleep deprivation is worse for OP than it is for an adult.", "Relative privation fallacy.  Set aside the cousin and now the mom for the moment.  Your post is again trivializing the OP's feelings and not treating them as valid when they are valid and reasonable.  An unreasonable and excessive burden is being placed on the OP, and her family does not appear to be mitigating it or validating it.  I am not saying sharing a room with the sister would be a utopia, but I can't see it as being worse than the current scenario.  Complaints happen, they are all adolescents.", "I would need solid evidence of that, and that no exception would be made in this case.  It also really would want me to say fuck CPS.  They already completely failed and NOW they want to micromanage?", "Again, how would that prevent the two sisters from sharing a room?  I am not saying that the cousin would share a room with either of the other two.", "Agreed! I only said I doubted that would actually happen due to the imagined arguments against it that would likely come from the 17 y/o not wanting to share her space with her 14 y/o sibling.", "Ooo good luck getting two teenagers who are used to having their own rooms to share a room until the bonus room is ready. Although it could motivate the parents to get that room ready ASAP.", "Yes, which is why I feel this is not an \"AITA\" type question. There are no real answers here. OPs parents are doing what they feel is best for this poor child, but OPNneeds some love and understanding and attention too. It's hard to share your space at 14, especially when you're sharing it with someone who's suffered trauma.\n\nOP, I do have to say that if I were your parents, I would have made the same decision regarding sleeping arrangements. Can you maybe talk to your mom and tell her how it's affecting you, rather than just dictating that she needs to sleep with someone else now? Maybe get a hurry-up on that room reno? Or perhaps you can find another temporary solution that you can think up together with your mom?", "I'm being hopeful since it's hard to be certain of emotions through a screen if words (then again this could also be fake since it is reddit).", "Ah, misread what you said, my bad.\n\nAnd yeah, I've not seen any comment about why OP can't bunk with big sister for the next... however long it takes to renovate the playroom.\n\nAlthough, even as I type that, I can't help but think that leaving the cousin *alone* may not be the smartest decision, depending on exactly what happened to her.\n\nIt should not under any circumstances be OP's problem to deal with, and I think they have every right to be pissed off about being woken up in the middle of the night every other night for the past eight months, but... I don't know.\n\nI guess cousin would be alone in the new room anyway, so maybe it'd be okay?\n\nOP is NTA, no question about that, but every potential way forward I see seems to have equally large problems.\n\nIt's probably a good thing I don't actually need to do anything but assure OP that they're in the right for how they feel and for what they want, because I really can't think of a satisfying resolution to this problem."]}
