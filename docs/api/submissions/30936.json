Is she in therapy, if not, she should be. It\u2019s unfair that your parents have put you in the position of being a support person for this child when you are not qualified to do so. They are ignoring the stress your cousins situation is putting on you. Perhaps you can suggest they get a baby monitor or walkie talkie for your cousin to contact you mom directly. She will need that when she\u2019s in her own room.", "NTA\n\n> We're converting our old playroom to a bedroom but until that happens she's sleeping in my room because we're closest in age. \n\n> My dad said that her room should be ready soon and they're not moving her to another room.\n\n**How the hell** is this taking *any* time at all?\n\nHow to convert a playroom to a bedroom:\n\n1. Set up a bed.\n\nYou're done!", "NAH, but this kid clearly has been traumatized and needs one of those audio baby monitors so she can wake up your mom without using you or anyone else as an intermediary.", "Why wasn\u2019t the solution for you to share with your sister for the time being, while cousin gets their own room? NTA, but I\u2019m side-eyeing your parents who clearly did not prepare well enough to take in this kid, or at the least didn\u2019t brief their own kids well enough on what to expect", "Two words .... Baby monitor. She can call for your mom herself. NTA!", "NTA, it's not fair your parents are putting the burden solely on you. Your dad is especially the AH when he basically told you \"shut up and deal with the consequences of my actions.\" If she doesn't get tucked in, will she think it's not bed time and be able to leave the room any time during the night?", "\n\n\nAnyone suggest you share with your sister and cousin gets the room yet?", "Just wanted to say I\u2019m so sorry :( your parents need to prioritize you too.", "NTA\n\nHow about you suggest setting up some way for her to call your mom directly without waking you up? Maybe a walkie talkie or leaving you homes telephone next to her bed so she can call your mom\u2019s cellphone?\n\nI totally understand how this is interfering with your sleep, but she needs your mom\u2019s support so it\u2019s better to find a way she can get that without it being so much load on you.", "NTA.  I think it sounds like your cousin has some sort of issues that might require therapy and putting that on you to deal with is not fair or right.  I\u2019m not a therapist but I\u2019m willing to bet, things are somehow going to be worse once your cousin is in her own room.  Maybe try speaking to your parents highlighting that your cousins behavior is not normal?  I know it sounds like an odd suggestion but try asking one of your siblings if you can sleep in their room for a night or 2 but go to their room after your parents have gone to bed OR go sleep on a couch.  Somehow create a situation that\u2019s going to leave your cousin in the room alone.  See what happens\u2026I think the reaction by your cousin will be negative in a way your parents are finally going to have to stop ignoring the problem and get your cousin help.", "NTA but your parents are. They shouldn't be putting this kind of responsibility on you, your cousin obviously has some kind of trauma. That's not something a 14yo should be handling.", "NAH, i do see how this is exhausting. What even happened to her? She sounds quite traumatized and is being clingy because of it, not much you can do about that tbh besides what you did and waiting it out", "NTA.  Your mom needs to teach your cousin to go to her if she needs something in the night, with consequences if necessary.  \n\nWhy can't you and your older sister share a room for a bit?  That seems to be a better option than anyone sharing with your cousin.", "NTA can you go and sleep with your brother until her bedroom is ready. At 14 year old a good sleep night is necessary for your body.", "NAH, but I agree with the voice activated monitor.  If she won\u2019t use it, you can.  She\u2019ll still wake you up but at least you won\u2019t get even more awake by getting physically out of your bed.  \n\nI completely get your frustration, but try not to resent your parents too much.  It sounds like they chose the most workable solution they had short of tossing her back in the non-family foster care pool.\n\nCan your mother sleep on a cot or air mattress in the hall outside of your room a few times a week to lessen being woken up?", "NAH. This is a tough situation. This child is experiencing the effects of trauma, and the foster system definitely didn\u2019t help. She sees you as a comfort and someone she can trust which is amazing, but I understand how annoying and frustrating it would be with this big change. Try to hold out until her room is finished. Sleep on the couch or ask your sister to let you camp in her room on the floor if you aren\u2019t getting sufficient sleep. Arm your cousin with a flashlight and bottle of water at bedtime to try to soothe her fears and avoid needing to get up for water. \n\nYour parents are kinda AHs for not understanding where you are coming from, but it\u2019s likely also stressful for them financially and emotionally for whatever caused this situation. Her new room will be ready before you know it.", "NAH\n\nI see your point, but your parents are creating a solution and the current set up is basically the only allowable option by CPS rules.\n\n10 and 17 is too much of a gap to be allowed.\n\nYour brother is too old and male.\n\nYour parents are too old.\n\nYou could room with your sister?\n\nBut unfortunately there\u2019s a heavily traumatised little kid in the middle and at the moment your room is the only option.\n\nIt sucks, but moving her multiple times will just compound her trauma, and her room is nearly done.\n\nHang in there.", "NTA. Your cousin has been through a lot but that doesn't mean that the world revolves around her. Sit down with your parents and tell them how this is making you feel. Don't fuss or yell, just tell them honestly how this is making you feel. Once they know, it might help them understand better.\n\nThen they need to talk with your cousin and make her understand that it isn't right to keep waking you up. That she needs to be considerate of your needs too, not just her own. She might be young but she's old enough to understand that much.", "NTA. They are putting way too much on you. Are you able to sleep with ear plugs in? Or go sleep in the couch? Or just pretend to sleep through her crying for a few nights.", "NTA \n\nSounds like she needs to be sharing a room with your mom.", "NTA, just sleep on the couch at night.", "NTA but you parents are", "OP YOU NEED TO LET YOUR PARENTS READ THIS THREAD.

You're being parentified and are losing sleep because your parents are abdication their responsibility.\n\nSleep deprivation is a torture technique.\n\nYou're being abused.\n\nTalk to a school counselor about this.", "I would only ever do this if I was getting paid for it. This is like a job and not one you signed up for every night when you should be sleeping.  And with the way she is, I\u2019m a little worried that they\u2019re not even planning to move her because they\u2019re worried to leave her alone.  Regardless, your parents are being assholes hardcore, having to deal with this at 14 can seriously affect you for the rest of your life and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re parents are taking that or you or the entire situation seriously enough at all.  I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going through some stuff too with whatever\u2019s going on, but you are 14 and they should most definitely be more considerate.", "NAH. Depending on the agreement of your parents taking her in, it's possible that legally she cannot share a room with your older siblings because of the age gaps or in the case of your brother their gender. And you don't know if there was any sort of situation which instilled this sort of fear of leaving the room in the middle of the night by her previous living arrangements. She might have been beaten for doing so and needs someone to show her it's okay. It's possible she has a lot of trauma. Granted it's not on you take care of that trauma, but your situation is temporary. It will get better.", "Nah but what trauma did the niece experience that led her to foster care. So that means in 6 months she went from her parents or primary Care to foster care to your house. She had crazy rules most likely and was not allowed to leave her room. Yes it's a little annoying that she wakes you up. But a little empathy could be nice and maybe try talking to her and see if you can help her leave the room.\n\nYes it's annoying but look at it from her point of view, remove from a parent, removed from Foster Care and now the house she's in now the person she's living with doesn't want her there either, how much rejection should a little girl take just to make you more comfortable.", "NTA. \n\nWalkie Talkie for her, earplugs for you", "NAH it's a shit situation for everyone and at your age you shouldn't be expected to deal with it as well as all adult who has signed up for this. I've been in similar situations and it work out better if you find somewhere else to sleep instead of insisting they move the guest.", "Do you have a phone that she can use to call your mom at night instead of waking you up?", "NTA but could you share the room with your older sister instead?\nShe'll have a room for herself and you could sleep until the end of the construction.", "NAH and this is way beyond Reddit's pay grade. That's one hell of a traumatized kid and obviously needs loads of professional help. I get that your parents are in a tight situation, but they should make sure you get enough sleep. Sleep is the most important thing for a kid your age, and also you'll end up resenting your cousin when she keeps you awake. \n\nYou're certainly not an AH, but I think your parents aren't really trying to parentify you on purpose here instead of being stressed out by the situation and can't think of better solutions.\n\nDo anything you can to get the sleep you need. Earplugs, sleeping in your sister's room or anything you might come up with. I really feel for your cousin, but her trauma doesn't justify depriving you of sleep.", "How long until the other room is ready? You should have more sympathy for her, even if you have to go wake up your mom. She's only 10 and had a shitty life before this. I know it sucks, but you should really try to be a good friend for her. Can you secretly sleep on a couch somewhere else instead?", "You\u2019re NTA, for expressing yourself, and how the situation is impacting you too. \nYour cousin is having a trauma reaction to something from what happened to her overnight, either in her home or foster care. \n\nWork with her; don\u2019t you alone go get your mum for help. \nGrab a torch, turn it on, and give it to her, tell her to hold your hand, and together you\u2019ll go get your mum.\nKeep repeating it, one day it will stop because she\u2019s more comfortable, or because she has her own room. \n\nIf it\u2019s hard for you, it\u2019s hard for her, it\u2019s not going to get better unless you work together.", "NAH but you are being negatively impacted by her actions. Sleep is important. You are not in charge of managing her trauma. Next time she wakes you up to get your mom, maybe just leave and sleep on a couch. Also do a little research because most fostering agencies have strict sleeping arrangements. Room sharing with anyone but a sibling is often not allowed.  ETA: If it gets bad enough, you can warn your parents that you will talk with the CPS rep about the situation when they do a check in. I would avoid actually doing so other than as a last resort, but sleep really is important. I understand she is traumatized, but your family was clearly not ready to take her in yet and did so at your expense.", "Nta, but try to be patient with her. It sounds like things have been very rough for her. Maybe share with her some things that comfort you. I know it sucks that you have to deal with this, but remember, she is going through a lot, too. I recommend on weekends or something finding  ways to encourage her to leave the room without your mom. For instance, \"Hey cousin, if you're awake, I'm going to get a snack. You can come with me.\" I hope everything goes well", "NTA but boarding YTA if you talk about her when she can hear you. She\u2019s obviously been through a traumatic experience\u2026 things you probably can\u2019t even imagine\u2026. and the tension coming off you won\u2019t help. Will probably make it worse. I feel so horrible for her.", "You\u2019re NTA.  The cousin is NTA.  But your parents suck.  Setting up a room takes a day or two - even if it\u2019s filled to the brim. Empty it, add bed. \n\nBut if she\u2019s alone and won\u2019t leave the room who will she ask for help when she wakes up? That\u2019s another reason your parents are really the assholes. They must know this.", "Eh, I\u2019m a little bit in between with this one. You are lacking any empathy for the trauma she has been through. She was locked in a room and not allowed out. She is terrified to wake an adult because she probably got abused for it in the past. A 14 yr old is less intimidating than an adult. \n  It\u2019s not fair that you\u2019re not getting sleep, that\u2019s a lot to put on you. You should be sharing a room with your older sister while your cousins room is done. That\u2019s the only solution that makes sense right now if you\u2019re needing a break. \n  She will continue to be traumatized for a long time which is extremely sad. I understand it sucks for you, but man look at how much she has been through at only 10 years old. She was so abused she hides under the bed crying.", "Move your things into the playroom and sleep there.", "Nta", "NTA but it sounds like your cousin experienced A LOT of trauma in her past. I know it isn\u2019t you\u2019re problem and in a perfect world she\u2019d have a room already, but its not. Try your best to give her a little grace. I saw in another comment she used to be locked in her room by foster parents, and obviously she\u2019s not with her bio parents anymore. Your cousin has been abused and abandoned by everyone that she has ever known. Again it\u2019s not the job of a 14 year old to fix it, and you\u2019re not wrong in wanting your own space. But if you\u2019re going to have those discussions with your parents maybe shield her from it if possible. She probably feels like a huge burden already. Wishing you the best of luck and the both of you a quick resolution so you get your own space.", "[deleted]", "NTA your not an AH, but your parents won't do what you want regardless of what the reddit says.  since your mom has to get up anyway, tell your mom to a toy walkie-talkie for your cousin. Then, your cousin can get your mom herself without leaving the room.", "NTA.  A few potential options.  \n\nCan you move in with your older sister for a short while?  Can they get your cousin a phone or a walkie talkie for her to contact your mom without waking. You?  Meantime you would wear noise canceling headphones?", "N A H. Your cousin is experiencing a high level of trauma. I feel sorry for her and everyone involved. It takes a lot for a child to be put in foster care, so just think about that and what it means to your cousin. Right now, your cousin needs to feel loved and that she's in a secure place. She can't sleep with your parents because CPS  won't allow it. You're the closest in age, and while you didn't ask for this, this is an opportunity to think beyond yourself and your immediate frustrations/stress. I know that's hard to think about at 14. I'm 35 and I've experienced a lot in my short life. One thing that I'm grateful for now is having those stressful experiences where I (and my brothers) had to deal with extraordinary life situations. It taught us valuable things like true humility, empathy, prioritization, placing family first, etc.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is this: your situation is an unfortunate one. Your cousin's is an even bigger one. While this situation is stressful for you, and your feelings are understandable, please try to think beyond yourself and your immediate needs. What you're going through is only temporary until the room is ready. The scarring she has is deep, and the she needs is warmth, love, and security.", "It's a little bit rough, but you can use headphones and ignore her. She will have no choise and go for mother by herself.", "NTA.  Can you go sleep on the living room/family room sofa?", "YTA but a soft one. I get that it\u2019s annoying but she\u2019s like this for a reason. If this was permanent I would be on your side but since this is temporary try to be a little more understanding. I\u2019m sure she was put in foster care for a reason and maybe wasn\u2019t in the best home. She could have been molested, beaten, or abused in other ways and this fear is completely natural.", "Your 10-yo cousin is likely traumatized by whatever she was taken into foster care for, and then further traumatized just by being in the system. She's got a lot going on, and she probably can't help how she acts at this time. Changing rooms multiple times will probably make her behavior worse.  Hopefully, your parents have her in therapy.  \n\nAs you're the youngest of your family, you sharing a room is just the way it goes. \n\nSo yes, in what is probably going to be a massively downvoted verdict, YTA. Perhaps you could be grateful that you were not removed from your nuclear family, put into foster care for half a year, and then forced to share a room with a cousin who doesn't want you.", "YTA because you don\u2019t want to compromise. It\u2019s temporary. You could sleep with your sister. You could sleep in the lounge or in the room \u201cin construction\u201d for a few days. In truth you want *your room* and you want it alone. \nIt\u2019s absolutely fine to want a good night sleep and it\u2019s also absolutely understandable to not want to babysit. But you have options, and you\u2019re not taking them, focusing on \u201cmy other siblings can do it!\u201d (When clearly there\u2019s a reason why your parents haven\u2019t allowed it, either legal or practical.)\nThat said it\u2019s a bad situation and I feel a little for you. I was used as a forced babysitter for ten years. It sucked. But basically your cousin\u2019s situation is a lot worse than yours and you\u2019re so focused on resenting her for taking your space that you can\u2019t seem to feel much empathy for the poor kid.  \nSo yes, YTA. And so is your father for speaking to you like that when you made your frustration clear. But you\u2019re not looking for solutions, just validation. \nThe only innocent here is the poor traumatized kid.", "YTA, poor thing suffered enough, you should make her feel like home instead of writing about her online.", "Soft YTA because you're only a kid that doesn't really understand anything yet.\n\nShe's scared, you say she refuses to do anything to wake your mom up, don't you think that has a reason? She's probably traumatised because of something that happened in the past, maybe her mom/foster mom would hit her or screamed at her or even worse if she woke her up and feels like you are a safe person to ask that to.\n\nYes, it sucks that you have to put up with it but it's temporary and the best for her, because you're closer in age to her, she feels safer with you, she can tell you things without being scared, so put up with it because she needs you, you can't even begin to understand what she has been through, give her a pass.\n\nIf this was indefinitely I'd say otherwise because you need your rest, you're just a kid, but it's not, so just be there for her for a while.", "I don't know if you told your parents that \"it's bullshit that they're making [you] babysit their niece all night\" in front of your cousin or not. If she was present, then YTA. And your dad probably told you to shut up because he needed you to stop talking like that in front of her *now*. If she wasn't present, then he's TA. He should have explained to you why she needs to share your room.\n\nIt sounds like legally she has to have a proper bedroom, can't share with your parents/mom, probably can't share with your brother, and your parents might have a good reason she can't share with your sister (maybe she's too old per CPS? Or maybe they think your sister is less able to afford a bad nights sleep than you are?) I always try to explain to my kids my reasoning for why I do the things I do - even at a young age, they respond much better to explanations than they do to \"because I said so.\"\n\nThe whole situation obviously sucks. I'm sure your parents are under a lot of stress over the entire situation. As much as I love my niece and nephews, adding a kid to the family is a huge deal and your parents are probably going through a lot of expenses (financially and emotionally) that they didn't necessarily choose.\n\nAlso, I saw in the comments that your cousin won't use a device to communicate with your mom at night? Once your cousin's room is ready, how do they plan to have her let your mom know she needs help at night? Baby monitor?", "NTA. They need to set up a room fast for her. Also they need to set up a monitor. Not one with a camera cause of her age and perhaps past trama. Also remember to keeping being kind to her. It is not her fault she is reacting how she us.", "I like the baby monitor idea. That\u2019s genius. You might wake up but if you don\u2019t t have to get out of bed you may be able to fall back asleep easier. I feel sorry for you honey and I also feel sorry for your cousin. How scary this must be for her. I wish the best for both of you. NTA", "Well your NTA but dang I feel for that kid. Imagine one day you wake up and everything you know is gone. You spend 6 months living in strangers homes then get put into a room with someone who sees you as a burden. My heart breaks for her. \n\nThat she is hiding under the bed and afraid to get out of her bed in the night is just so sad. What has that poor child be through. She is clearly heavily traumatized by what she has experienced. \n\nWhy dont you ask if you can sleep in the old play room for now.

It sounds like  an enormous amount of trauma this girl went through to be scared to leave her room.

This is too long for you to have to be dealing with.\n\nI imagine your parents are dealing with a lot right now - the factors (with your aunt?/uncle?) that got cousin into foster care, the legal system and figuring out cousin's future, caring for a traumatized little girl and getting her some treatment - not to mention the usual worries of running a family. They may feel that you have so much and need to help (or, at least, not add to the problems they are dealing with).

Maybe you sister just trades beds with you for a while. Maybe your mom sleeps in your room for a bit and you share with your older sister. I would say that there will be a time to let your cousin sleep in a room by herself, but that sounds way too traumatic for her right now. Maybe the counselor for your cousin can suggest a good alternative (.e.g, using a baby monitor).\n\nI think you giving as much patience and compassion to your cousin AND your parents would be very helpful; so is using your voice to let your parents know (calmly) that there are problems they need to address sooner rather than later.", "NTA - Talk to your school guidance counselor if you feel comfortable.

Your parents are the AH for telling you to shut up and ignoring the harm this situation is causing you. They may not have many options, they may be stressed out, and they may be trying to do something morally sound for your cousin, but this situation is harmful to you--your brain is literally still growing and you need to sleep in order to thrive as a student and happy teenager.\n\nSchool guidance counselor can also recommend to your parents that you go to therapy as well--it can be really important to have someone to talk to about how you feel who isn't personally involved in the situation. Most of all, it creates a record that you were experiencing a hardship and seeking help, in case your grades dip or you get into a fight while feeling overwhelmed.\n\nFrustration has a way of boiling up, especially when we aren't getting enough sleep, so proactively seeking therapy and resources can help avoid hard days in the future--it doesn't seem like your situation is changing any time soon at home, so you need to look at what is within your power to change.\n\nIt may be possible that the school can force your parents hand--but it sounds like your parents may be stuck with Child Protective Services guidelines about who you cousin can share with based on age and gender.\n\nFor the record, your feelings are valid and I'm proud of you for knowing your health and quality of life are important, for bringing it up with your parents even if they were AH to you about it, and I hope you find the serenity to get through this difficult situation that you should not have to go through.", "Lightly ESH.

I understand that none of this is your choice but please try and be patient with her. \n\nYour parents probably aren\u2019t able to move her to one of your siblings rooms or their room. CPS has very strict rules on who can share rooms and you are probably the only one who can. \n\nHowever, taking care of her is not your burden to bare. You need to ask your parents this question: what do you plan on doing after the room share is done?\n\nThis girl will not leave her room until your mother comes to get her. So what will they do after you are not there to alert your mom that she needs help? \n\nYour parents need to figure that out NOW and implement it before the room change.

So if they won\u2019t get their butts in gear and get her bedroom ready so you can get a good night\u2019s rest every night regardless of what she needs, you\u2019re going to fix it yourself by making sure you aren\u2019t around for her to wake up.", "This is not a great answer, but it might help:\n\nCan your cousin use a baby monitor to wake up your mum without getting out of bed or waking you up?

All I can recommend is you show your parents this post. You\u2019re not old enough to find out what happened to your cousin, nor is it your business, and you should say as much, but you also need to ask them plain and simple why you, a fourteen year old child, are being put in a position to care for another child who has clearly been severely traumatized. \u2018Who\u2019s taking care of me?\u2019 You should ask.

Now, the rules might be different where you are, but you\u2019ve already said the room she\u2019s moving into isn\u2019t ready yet and not legally acceptable under rules with CPS, so there are limited options here unless you are able to strike a deal with a sibling to let you bunk with them until her room is done.\n\nAlso though, your cousin\u2019s behavior suggests she has been through a lot of trauma.

But also, if a deal can\u2019t be made for you to sleep somewhere else until her room is done, try to keep in mind that she\u2019s not behaving this way to bother or upset you.

Really icky situation that kid is in.\n\nYou're NTA for not wanting to share your room with the current status quo, 100%... but try to see it from your cousin's perspective, and what she's been through, and talk to your parents about a better solution that doesn't involve you having your sleep disrupted or you feeling responsible for an obviously traumatized kid.

That\u2019s how that works, there\u2019s no \u201cwe need time to plan for it.\u201d Ask foster parents if they are given time to plan, now imagine being a family member no idea what\u2019s going on with your niece and suddenly you get a knock on the door saying, do you want your family or not? The parents likely stepped up in an emergency, they weren\u2019t like \u201clet\u2019s adopt our niece! It will be so fun!\u201d No amount of planning can prepare you to be a parent, and there\u2019s definitely no way to plan for an emergency custody situation. Clearly, this family wasn\u2019t the first option, my guess is they likely didn\u2019t know niece was even in foster care until someone showed up at their door step asking to take her because typically children go with family before strangers. The fact she was already with strangers tells me that this family did not know she was being abused and this was an emergency situation. Have some empathy for a child who was abused and the parents who are trying to keep her out of the system. Yes, OP is in a tough situation, and it is not fair. But unfortunately, it\u2019s going to take time, and it is more important that all the children have a home they are safe in. I am flabbergasted at this thread, is no one an adult in this thread. Yes, she shouldn\u2019t have to do all this, but most adults know that there are regulations with CPS. SO the parents likely can\u2019t share a room with her, not at this age. Same for the sibligings, ones a boy and ones almost an adult.

One day, you'll truly understand why there are times when our justifiable feelings must be put aside for something much greater and more worthy than temporary physical comfort, privacy, etc. \n\nOnce she's out of your room, it will impact the rest of the family much more at night.

Hopefully, you have someone you can talk/vent to about your feelings who won't just throw more fuel on the fire and will still listen and care about your well-being.

Months worth of interrupted sleeps can't be helping you at all. I really hope the situation gets resolved soon.", "So this is obviously a crappy situation for everyone involved, but I am sure CPS also requires she be in the room with a similarly aged and same gender child. Your sister is too old, your brother is male, and your parents would be inappropriate also. I think looking into a baby monitor or walkie talkie or something similar until the room is complete is the best solution. It sucks for you right now, no doubt, but you also have to remember your cousin is just a little girl going through something terrible. \n\nI know when this tough time is over, it will fade so quickly in your memory but she will always remember her big cousin who helped her so much when she was scared and going through hell and made sacrifices to keep her out of an even worse situation in foster care. I can promise you will forget the bad times when you are getting better sleep. I have a young baby right now, when he was born I got just over an hour of sleep a night for the first week, and at 5 months we are up to about 8 hours with 4-5 wake ups in that time, even such a short time later the memory of how incredibly hard the beginning was has started to fade.

Aka make a big enough noise at dinner/afterwards that they have to talk. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell them they can't neglect you and put her entirely on you, that you understand her trauma but its affecting your school/life/sleep and its important they take resposibility to care for her during the night instead of you.   \n\n\nIts not your fault what happened last night happened, and they shouldn't be taking it out on you. If its this bad they should be sleeping in the hallway on a campbed with the door ajar to hear and respond quickly.   \n\n\nPlus CPS won't like this, so they need to find a solution that isn't affecting other children. You should talk to a friend's parent if they are still ignoring you tomorrow or your teachers at school.", "Tell your sister that you'll trate rooms with her if she's so upset. \nThe one time you refuse to take care of her at nigh, they still won't take the matter into their own hands and make sure she's being taken care of, but decide that they'll let her suffer, to the point she vomits, just so you can be the villain in the end.\nIs she seeing a therapist or something? Your parents should ask for ways to help her at night that are more effective for the family dynamic and for your cousin as well.\nHonestly, I know the situation is annoying and unfair to you, but I also feel for that little girl. But at the end, they can't expect a 14 year old to deal with it. It's too much.", "Can you sleep in the living room? I know that is not a perfect solution but your sleep will atleast not be interrupted.", "This sounds like OP needs to have a conversation with her school guidance counselor and the social worker from CPS, in that order.\n\nThe dog can learn to go in a crate, or it can sleep with one of the older kids.", "Walking down the hall to wake up mom is not being a caregiver nor in any sense being given responsibility. CPS knows the cousin is in this room with OP and they are fine with it- that is all you need to know to understand that, while not ideal, this is a safe living situation and OP will just need to deal a little longer- sometimes life and living with other people sucks but at 14 they are more than old enough to handle it", "Honestly OP this is the way. Ask you sister if you can bunk with her for like\u2026 a month or whatever it\u2019s going to be until the playroom is converted. Tell her you\u2019ll just be sleeping there and she can have her space during the day if she needs it. If you have a good sister she\u2019ll see that as a better solution than having to share with a ten year old potentially.", "Right? Can't the parents just tell CPS that the kid has her own room with OP but they keep extra mattresses in their room (in case she gets scared at night) and in her soon-to-be permanent bedroom if she \"wants to get used to it?\"", ">The kid should be in with the parents.\n\nThat is very much against CPS regulations.", "I was also thinking a two way baby monitor would work.  Then all cousin has to do is say auntie I need you.", "Can you have compassion for a fourteen year old?  Why should her sleep be compromised?  She\u2019s not a licensed therapist and shouldnt be expected to be a caregiver for a traumatized ten year old.", "The parents may think they are doing their best, but they likely have tunnel vision and are unwilling to go outside of that plan.  The OP's needs require more consideration, and they seem to refuse to do that.  It isn't all about the cousin.", "The parents aren't working hard enough.  8 months is more than enough time to get a room finished.  They seem to be downplaying if not outright ignoring how hard this is for the OP.  We have gone beyond short term.  The consequences of one do not justify the consequences to the other.", "It is hard enough to manage being woken up and being a caregiver at night for your own kid as an adult who has a fully formed brain and capacity to manage emotions appropriate. Expecting a young teenager to be able to do this for months and months and months on end is absolutely bonkers. This would grate on even the kindest, gentlest, most compassionate child. OP is allowed to have these feelings and be frustrated and want better solutions and a more equally shared burden. SHE IS ALSO A CHILD and right now she is the only child being asked to sacrifice and when she dares to say something about being unhappy, she gets threatened with punishment. At bare minimum the parents should be saying something along the lines of \"I hear you. I know this really sucks. I'm sorry. This is a hard situation but right now, other sleeping arrangements aren't an option. What can we do to work together to make this easier while we wait for the other room to be finished?\" and at least have a conversation and acknowledge and validate OP. In caring for the 10 year old and managing her trauma, OP is getting lost.", "Yeah, not looking too good for either kid", "CPS is not removing a traumatized blood relative from a safe home because of a minor conflict between two kids. CPS knows perfectly well this is the best possible place for the kid to be and might be able to offer some solutions. \n\nEven the bedroom rule is a lot less inflexible than some posters are making it seem. The rule is that everyone needs their own bed in an appropriate bedroom, not that you're legally prohibited from ever sleeping elsewhere. Kids are still allowed to bunk in with other family members. OP could sleep in any of her siblings' rooms, mom could sleep in OPs room with her cousin, as long as that's not the \"official\" sleeping arrangement.", "We'll just have to agree to disagree.", "Exactly, it is more important not to guilt trip OP in this case. She is getting zero support. Her parents are too busy supporting her cousin. Glass child anyone?", "Well... the 14 y/o didn't want to share her space either, and nobody took any notice.", "Well, make the 17 yo suck it up like they are forcing the 14 yo to do to a point that could be considered abusive.", "It\u2019s under construction so they can do that.", "I WOULD HAVE KILLED FOR THIS! that\u2019s so brilliant! i get sleep paralysis every month or two\u2014i definitely grew up before echos were a thing, but until i was much much older, i didn\u2019t even know how to explain what was happening to me so i kept quiet. i also had nighttime vomit & so does my son. \n\nthank you for doing all of that for your kiddo! thank you for the ideas, and the thought to get talking to him now about that stuff.", "Ahh okay. I meant that 14f possibly would have escaped down there as soon as 10F started hassling her. Basements are so rare in England that assuming someone had one would be wild.", "Did you see OP's other comments? The room is delayed by permits. I think the playroom was probably a \"bonus space\" before, because it didn't have a window, closet, working outlets, or a 4th wall. CPS wouldn't approve the situation if any of the kids were sleeping there, and the cousin would be sent back to foster care. \n\nIt's a terrible situation. But sometimes bad situations need the best of a lot of bad solutions, because no good solutions exist.", "No problem. It's a really difficult situation.", "yeah, super not cool for the dad to yell at the 14yo, but 14yo teens can really push buttons and i can imagine (from both having a kid that age and from teaching them) that perhaps OP communicated her issues with her cousin in a less than kind/productive way (perhaps yelling about in front of her, etc) and that dad reacted.\n\nOP, this is really tough for everyone. Your feelings are valid. CPS is not going to take anyone away if your cousin or you occasionally sleep in another room (the rule is that everyone needs a bed in an appropriate bedroom, not that no one is ever allowed to sleep anywhere else). I would ask again for your parents to give you a break from sharing/nighttime disturbances - but think about the best time to have that convo. Not in front of your cousin, not when everyone is tired or busy.", "They *are* working on a better solution. But when that better solution involves construction and getting permits for said construction you cannot magically just make it go faster.", "She would get the room back once the new one is finished, and I doubt it would be worse than it is now for her.", "If the cousin is in foster care, the mom can't sleep in the same room.", "OP is 14. Still a kid. She needs sleep, as well. She might have lots of compassion, but her basic needs are not being met.", "OP is literally her cousins caregiver at night. She can\u2019t be expected to do more than she\u2019s already doing", "it is absolutely insane that you think this adolescent needs to \"work on trying to gain compassion\" for a child she is being forced into DAILY OVERNIGHT CARE for. This is a completely inappropriate burden to lay on a teenager. OP isn't treating her cousin cruelly or doing anything wrong at all.", "Yes, she should show compassion, but OP is also a child and one who is getting disturbed sleep because she's been forced to share with another much younger, traumatised child. It's hard to show compassion when you are suffering from chronic sleep deprivation, at a time in your life when you want to sleep Al the time anyway.", "You should work on your compassion and move the traumatized individual into your space 24x7 so that you are constantly awakened on the night, have no privacy whatsoever, ever, and no foreseeable end to having full time caregiver duties ***as a child***.  What you're saying is abject nonsense.\n\nNTA OP, imposing involuntary caregiver duty on you for another, traumatized child like this is unforgivable, this verges on abuse.", "Fuck compassion. She\u2019s not her caregiver. She\u2019s a fourteen year old girl. She needs and deserves rest at night just like anyone else. She\u2019s not her cousin\u2019s mother. \n\nLet the parents figure something out without burdening and traumatizing OP. \n\nNTA!  The PARENTS and OtHER SIBLINGS are TA.", "Basements vary greatly based on the age of the home, the region of the US and the weather patterns.  In flood/hurricane/zones, usually no or partial basements with built in sump pumps.  Earthquake zones, no basements. Tornado alleys, definitely basements.  \n\nAll regions have requirements for what is suitable for fostering.", "She THINKS the room is being delayed by permits.  We do not know whether that is true or just how much effort the parents are putting into getting permits or hiring a contractor who will pull the permits.  CPS would not have to know the OP was sleeping there, as long as the bed in the bedroom was maintained.  \n\nThere have to better solutions than the current status quo.  I think the parents don't want to have to admit to the OP that the cousin is simply not able to sleep alone in any room and using delaying tactics and refusing to do other things to hide that fact.", "I'd argue the 14 year old and parents are probably all sleep deprived. So they're all going to be on edge with each other from sleep induced irritability.", "It really doesn't take 6 months. It takes 6 months when you put it on the back burner and everything is \"I'll give them a call next week\".\n\nIt's literally 1 day of labor + town permit. Maybe they need an HVAC person or an electrician for half a day. That is the totality of it.", "Then they needed to figure out a better interim solution months ago. They haven't been surprised by the unexpected circumstance of construction taking time.", "At that point, the parents may stop bothering with renovating the other room. If I were OP, I would not give up my room like that.", "Both things can be true - OP clearly is still seeing the cousin as a burden, not thinking as to *why* a 10 year old is too traumatized to leave her room after she's tucked in, but also OP should never have been put in a position as a sole caregiver to a traumatized child. \n\nOP can have compassion while still developing boundaries - this might actually be a fantastic chance to learn how to keep herself safe (psychologically) while also helping others. \n\nOr she might continue being a 14 year old, which is when she should be *learning* compassion, not being expected to have a fully developed sense while also working under harsh conditions of being sleep deprived and having her household shaken up, while her parents aren't providing additional resources.", ">CPS would not have to know the OP was sleeping there, as long as the bed in the bedroom was maintained.\n\nYes, commit fraud with CPS. They would never interview the 10 year old to find out why there is a bed in a non-bedroom. \n\nIf you're suggestion is this bad it's time to give up on your idea that there must be a better way.", "We only have OP's words to go on here. A local housing department delaying a permit 6 months or more is totally a thing that happens, so there's no reason to think she or her parents are lying about this. You're looking for villains when there probably aren't any.\n\nYour solution doesn't make sense; even if making fraudulent claims to CPS was a good idea (it's not), there is or will be construction in that room, making it uninhabitable for anyone."]}
