So I decided to announce it in front of everyone. \nMy husband was of course the happiest one but after that, the rest of the party was all about me and the baby. Some even forgot to wish him because they were busy congratulating me. I kinda felt bad for taking the attention away from him but he didn't even seem to mind it. \n\n\nLater that day, his best friend came to me when I was in the kitchen just to say that it was very selfish of me to announce my news when it was my partner's day, he said that my partner does not even celebrate his birthdays and now that he decided to celebrate one, I shouldn't have made it all about myself. \n\nHe even accused me of doing it on purpose because according to him I can not stand it when all attention is not me. I decided not to argue with him because he's never liked me but I can't help feeling awful for taking all the attention away from him. \nHe has not hinted that he is upset at this and I haven't told him yet what his friend said. \n\n\nEdit: Afterwards, husband told me it was the best gift he received however he did not mention anything about announcing it in front of our families or not telling him first in private. \nWe are a very closely knitted family and I believe telling them this soon shouldn't be an issue. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688382583, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pg0ih/aita_for_outshining_my_husband_at_his_birthday/", "score": 1116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's finally happening. Yay. Oh, wait... someone found a way to make it not about you yet again. Birthdays are not special and not about you once again...\n\nSorry to say, but I agree with the best friend. You could have waited. You could have told him alone and made it his decision whether to tell everyone or not. But instead, you took the stage.  \n\nYTA (a soft one because who doesn't get carried away by good new once every while)", "Soft YTA, even though he was cool with you announcing it at his birthday, it's best to give your partner news like that first rather than telling his whole family and his friends all at once", "YTA. Your husband should have been told privately before making it public.", "If he doesn't like celebrating his birthday, he might appreciate that you took the attention off of him. Only he can answer that.\n\nBut.. why would you announce it to friends and family before talking to him in private? *That* deserves YTA. Whether you're an AH for taking attention away from him, is something only he gets to decide.", "YTA in my opinion but it really depends on how your husband feels. I think this is something you should have shared with your husband and only your husband first. He then could have decided if he wanted to make an announcement or keep it private a little longer.\n\nYour entire post talks about how your felt and about how others would feel getting the news but there is nothing talking about how you think your husband would like sharing the news. It does lean towards making it about you instead of your husband.", "YTA\n\nHis birthday or not, you took away a once-in-a-lifetime moment for you two to intimately share this moment.  You also took away from him the chance to tell people himself about the news.  \n\nThoughtless.  Also yeah, dick move to do it on his birthday - particularly since he usually doesn't celebrate them and this was an exception.", "A small YTA. Did you tell your husband before hand? No, you should have told him if you could announce it together. Also, why didn't you ask him after? You don't seem like a good communicator.", "YTA. You should have told your husband before anybody else. You already know that.", "Do you know why your husband doesn't celebrate his birthdays often? Like that's also big factor", "YTA\n\nYou don't make someone else's special day or celebration about you - and that's what you did.", "I will preface this comment with a congratulations on the baby!\n\nHowever, it seems very early to announce that news - unilaterally - to your friends and family when you only found out yesterday. Husband/partner should be the first to know and then you make those big decisions together. Most wait until after twelve weeks and the scans.\n\nIn respect to husband\u2019s birthday, you say his parents didn\u2019t celebrate it for years after his gran died when he was younger. So, yes that would make you in the wrong for taking the attention of him once again. Friend shouldn\u2019t have jumped down your throat, but I think he was coming from a place of concern. \n\nYTA", ">he's never liked me\nI wonder why. /Sarcasm \n\nYTA sharing that news should be an intensely private moment with your partner, not a performance piece in front of others.", "Extremely gentle YTA.

The timing was all that mattered.", "YTA", "Super weird you didn't tell him first. Yta for that.", "YTA. You should have told him first, and most people don\u2019t make a huge announcement to all of their friends and family until they\u2019ve at least seen a doctor, not just when they get a positive test.", "YTA. You wouldn\u2019t announce a pregnancy at a wedding, so why do it at someone\u2019s party? Even if it was your husband. You should have told him in private beforehand and let him make the decision whether the party was the right time to announce it.", "Massive YTA not because you did it at a birthday (this *is* problematic btw) but because you made your husband learn about his new baby alongside his entire family. \n\nWOW.\n\nYou did not give him a private moment between the two of you to enjoy. And beyond that you gave him zero say on when and where to tell his family the news. I\u2019m honestly speechless. Not to mention most people wait until 12+ weeks to tell friends and family because there\u2019s a higher risk of miscarriage before then. You really did your husband dirty, and on his first child no less. You owe him a massive apology, but tbh I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s enough. Doing it at his birthday party is just the icing on the cake. You really messed up OP and this comes off as incredibly selfish.", "YTA. You could have set up another day to make the announcement, that day was about your partner and you made it about you.", "YTA: It would have been a fantastic gift to tell him before his party *in private*. Then he could have decided when and how or if to tell everyone. You took that choice away from him. He rarely calls attention to himself and this one time he did but you made it all about you.\n\nThink about the past. His best friend might have a point.", "YTA. No question about it.\n\nAnd I disagree with other people here about being soft/mild AH. IMHO, this is assholery and disrespect in multiple levels. \n\nI hope you be a better parent than a partner. I'm sure he can help with that. Good luck.", "YTA - not for announcing it on his birthday, but for announcing it to the world before you've had a private conversation about it. \nYou then could have figured out next steps, including whether to announce it at the birthday\n\nIt is possible he may have wanted to hold off as it's still early / etc. These are things you should work out together", "YTA. This is big news for your husband to get and he didn\u2019t get the option to process in private before sharing it with the world. \n\nAlso, I really hope all of this works out for you, but a gentle reminder that not all positive pregnancy tests turn into healthy babies. My first pregnancy didn\u2019t work out. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t tell anyone, but you should only tell people initially you would feel comfortable telling about a loss. Your husband should be part of that discussion ideally, because he might have a different level of comfort than you with the news being out there so soon.", "YTA. You took away three special moments from your husband - a birthday celebration, a final family gathering, and, a fatherhood announcement. There's no getting any of that back for him, either. \n\nAre you going to do the same to your child?", "YTA: deep down you KNEW you announced it because you were jealous of the attention on your husband and wanted it back on yourself.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could have told him privately and let him decide if he wanted to tell everyone or wait.  \n\n\nDoes ring a tad bit like you wanted all the attention for yourself in the moment.", "YTA\n\nNot for ruining your husband\u2019s birthday, but for the fact that he found out he was going to be a father at the same time as all his friends and family. He absolutely deserved to get that news first.", "Yeah. YTA. \nYou could have shown him the pregnancy test kit before the celebration and asked if he wants to announce it. You basically made it all about you. The part where his family is here made it even worst.", "YTA dude \u2026 you need to tell this to your partner in private first.", "Well, for an outsider prospective YTA \n\nIt is your gender reveal party, everything is fine and suddenly one guy asks his partner to marry him, the other says yes, everyone congratulates them, and suddenly everyone forgot you and your baby even existed. The party became their engagement party. How would you feel about it? \n\nHowever the situation here is that you prepared it and you mentioned he doesn't like birthday parties. Talk to your husband and apologize, ask him how he felt about your actions. Maybe he was even happier the spotlight shifted to something he cares alot (we don't know your husband), maybe he was hurt about the fake birthday party, maybe he was reconsidering doing more parties until you validated his initial feelings on them, maybe he didn't care nor even noticed at all. Only he can \"tell\" if you are the asshole. Just talk with him\n\nETA: as everyone pointed out and I missed because I'm stupid, you should've told him privately nonetheless as a surprise, because this is going to affect you as a couple. \n\n!But what concerns me the most is that in one of your comments you say know why he doesn't like birthdays, and it is because last birthday when he was young it was like it wasn't a day about him at all. Girl, why did you do all this stuff?", "YTA. That\u2019s a great best friend right there", "Not enough info: talk to your husband", "YTA\n\nOther people's occasions aren't the place to tout how awesome you are, regardless of the circumstance.\n\nWeddings, birthdays, bat mitzvahs.\n\nThey're not about you.", "Congrats on your pregnancy. \n\nYTA for not telling him first. That should be an intimate moment you share with your partner before anyone else. \n\nI also am curious about the best friend\u2019s statement that you have to make everything about you.

Why couldn\u2019t you at least wait until the party was winding down before announcing it?", "I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t tell him first! Big YTA for that. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to share that privately? That\u2019s a huge life change and he deserved to know before you make that announcement to the world. That\u2019s the disrespectful part. \n\nThen you could have asked if he minded you telling it at his birthday party and it would have been fine. But you handled this very poorly.", "YTA. Don\u2019t give him private news in public.", "YTA- \"he didn't seem to mind it.\"\nThat would be because he is used to it\n\nCongrats on the baby but you knew what you were doing.", "Ask your husband if he\u2019s ok about it. Lots of YTA but if he\u2019s happy and doesn\u2019t care, who care what everyone else thinks.

He is the father. It's also his news. It's also about him, right?", "YTA but a very gentle one because you clearly only had positive intent. That is major news and the middle of a party where he is expected to be the centre of attention anyway, is not the best time for him to handle the news, as happy as it was. It should have been a private discussion", "YTA", "YTA. This is definitely the type of news you give someone one on one.", "YTA", "Why didn't you wait till his celebration was almost over and just before people left to make the announcement?\n\nYour husband rarely celebrates his birthday and in the rare occasion he did, you didn't give him his time at his own party?\n\nYou may be a YTA but a soft one if you didn't do this out of attention seeking.\n\nAnyway, what your husband thinks and feels are important. You may think he wasn't upset. It would probably be better if you asked him straight instead of wondering if you are TA.", "YTA. You didn't do it to make his birthday special for him. It was already special for him because it was a rare bday celebration with family who is about to move abroad. So now you have to do some introspection as to what your real reason was.", "I dont necessarily think YTA, i think you were just extremely inconsiderate. For a number of reasons. \n\n1. You say some people hadn't even had the chance to say happy birthday to him, so this was right at the start of the evening and you couldn't wait until after the main events - cake, song etc - were done?\n\n2. That is news you share with a partner privately and then the two of you agree together how to announce, you took that away from him, especially with announcing to his own family.\n\n3. He hadn't celebrated his birthday in years, there was just this one time, and the limelight was shifted to you, by you. Now, I have to agree with the friend on this bit because that is selfish. *there is no way in hell you didn't think the attention would shift to you, you absolutely knew* and it definitely seems like that's why you did it. \n\n4. You announced immediately after finding out you were pregnant, not waiting until the first scan as is the norm. That's for you guys to decide together, not you alone. But now if the worst happens, which hopefully it won't, he'll have to deal with informing everyone and his birthday will be forever tainted. \n\nI literally don't see any upside to what you did and it does seem like pure attention grabbing to be honest.

There are a few reasons why though after a quick read through the thread, most have been covered. (Big shout-out to the person who said that people who don't like to celebrate birthdays usually feel that way because of previous bad experiences. That describes me and why I don't like to celebrate birthdays.)\n\nEspecially if this was your first pregnancy, you do not know how your husband will react. When my wife became pregnant with our first, I burst into happy tears. It was an extremely emotional time. That's something I wish to share with my partner and only my partner. It's a special moment between US.

You absolutely should tell your husband about this. You can ask him if he really was bothered by the attention being on you, and then he can address the issue of his friend's behavior.

And you're meant to be a partnership. The second you thought about buying a pregnancy test it should have been in your head to talk to him about it. Instead you go off on a solo mission to buy a test and use it without involving him. So hard YTA just for that.\nThen you make the CONSCIOUS DECISION not to tell him, on the basis of \"Oooh, a fun surprise!\" That's not cool. Again, you just found out you're pregnant with his child. NOW GO HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.\nDid your wedding vows have you promise to forsake all others \"Unless you find a super fun reason not to\"?\nThis was a BIIIIIIG life moment and you didn't act like a partner to him.", "Wouldn't bother me at all.

I\u2019m from the UK and every single person I have known to be pregnant announced that pregnancy after 12 weeks. \n\nI\u2019ve also known people to have had miscarriages and it\u2019s not a taboo subject. It\u2019s discussed openly, honestly, and respectfully at the mother\u2019s and their partner\u2019s discretion. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to police other people\u2019s pregnancies but I think what OP did was an asshole move for a number of reasons, but the main one being that that isn\u2019t how a significant other should find out their going to be a parent.", "Yes, but in my opinion the best friend is an even bigger asshole. Sounds like he used OP's admittedly ill-thought surprise to attack her for something her husband doesn't seem to mind that much. Even if he was hurt, it wasn't his buddy's place to interfere with the couple. Also, people who don't celebrate their birthdays usually do it because we don't especially care about being the center of attention; OP is YTA because she did it publicly, not because she ruined the party.", "Exactly.  OP did make her partner not as important at his own party.  If she had discussed the news and gotten his ok to announce at the party it would have been ok. In this case it was not. \n\nOP YTA", "exactly, the announcement itself wasn't wrong. Becoming a father was so amazing that it literally would be the best birthday gift ever. And sharing that news is incredibly fun.\n\nBut, it is also something I want to learn from my partner in private. One so we can celebrate together. But two, pregnancy can be risky and challenging. And telling people sometimes adds to that pressure. Many people choose not to tell a wide group of people so soon. This is the kind of thing it makes sense to be on the same page as your partner.\n\nAlso, the friend is an AH for commenting on something that wasn't his business. If OP is happy and husband is happy, who is he to interfere and impose his views of birthday? Guessing he isn't a parent...", "yeah I agree with this", "I disagree.  What is best is what works for OP and her husband in their relationship. I am not big on parties mainly because I don\u2019t want to be the center of attention. I will enjoy them though. \n\nI would have no issue with and love for my wife to announce something like this at my party. \n\nIf husband was ok with it then great!\n\nNTA.", "And also, depending on how far along, you usually *wait* quite a while before telling everyone :/ \n\nThere's a reason this is built into our social tradition (highly dependant on where you live)... Our body naturally aborts up to *half* of [all pregnancies](https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis-finds-majority-of-human-pregnancies-end-in-miscarriage-biorxiv) early on in the process, usually within the first 3 months. Usually, like 50% of the time the body aborts, it's because of \"aneuploidy\", where an [abnormal number of chromosome detected](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy). \n\nCommenting to spread awareness, because \"finding out you're pregnant\" normally doesn't justify telling people. People wait months. \n\nAnd many women in your life have been pregnant and lost it without telling anyone. \n\nAnd, even more surreally, many women have *been pregnant* and not known it.", "Thank you for, \"only he can answer that.\" I keep wondering: why hasn't she asked her husband if what she did made her an AH? If my husband's best friend came to me and said that, the first person I'd go to is - my husband. Maybe I'm doing this marriage thing wrong?", "I would be pretty upset if I found out that I was going to be a father at the same time as my entire social circle. The idea of it being a birthday gift is sweet, but that could have happened the morning of before everyone else arrived and then as a couple they could have made the decision when to make it public.", "She ruined a literal once in a lifetime opportunity that should have happened privately between her and her husband. I can\u2019t even fathom thinking it\u2019s ok to NOT tell your partner privately. I have a feeling it\u2019s common for OP to be selfish, because I can\u2019t imagine a healthy partner ever considering telling a man he\u2019s going to be a dad for the first time *in front of his entire family and friends.* Yikes.", "It seems weird that her response to \u201cmy husband might be upset but I don\u2019t know\u201d is to go ask the internet if her husband could/should be upset instead of asking, say\u2026her husband. \n\nPeople are strange and have strange relationship skills.", "He says he is too old to celebrate birthdays. Plus when he was a kid, his grandmother died a few days before his birthday and his parents didn't celebrate it for next two years, after that he stopped asking them to arrange a party for him.", "Err you know the husband is involved in the pregnancy too, right?", "I completely agree that she should have told the husband first. I also understand where you\u2019re coming from, but we don\u2019t know OP, nor do we know this group of people she\u2019s announced to. \n\nThere\u2019s a movement to destigmatize telling family and friends early on. As you know, miscarriages are common in the first trimester but what if OP is the type of person who needs to have the support of others in times of grief (should a miscarriage occur)? Why deny her or other people potentially vital support during a tough time? Again, I agree that the husband should be the first to know and that the announcement could\u2019ve waited til the next day. I want just want to point out why it\u2019s becoming more normalized now a days to disclose early on.", "There is no such thing as too early to tell people. If she felt ready, then she was ready. I agree the sentiments that husband should have known first, but if people want to share their news with the entire world the second they find out, that is their choice.", "There\u2019s no way you are equating someone wedding to your partners party lol", "I might announce a pregnancy at *my own* wedding, this is a very messed up analogy!\n\nGiving him great news on his birthday is a wonderful birthday gift.", "Exactly. It\u2019s clear that OP does not consider her husband and doesn\u2019t care to include his input when making huge life decisions\u2026 because that\u2019s exactly the behavior she showed in this situation. It\u2019s pretty obvious that the friend was correct when he said that OP always needs the attention on her (this kind of statement doesn\u2019t just come out of nowhere IMO). YTA and I feel sorry for the husband.", "Honestly the intentions don\u2019t matter when you willingly and purposely ruin a once in a lifetime opportunity for your husband to find out he\u2019s going to be a first time dad. And she did so at his birthday, knowing he normally doesn\u2019t celebrate it because he grew up being disappointed by birthdays. And she chose to give him no say in when and where to tell his family the pregnancy news. Good intentions mean nothing when you\u2019re this selfish. YTA in a huge way.", "That would be an epic plot twist.", "oh no, that poor 29 yr olds birthday party!", "This is the reply I was scrolling for lol. Totally agree. It all depends on if husband is upset or not. If he is then total YTA. But he if doesn\u2019t care at all then neither should anyone else.", "The husband being an AH part is just your wild ass assumption that wasn't anywhere in the post.", "So guys aren't allowed to express their feelings with their friends now? Women never vent to and talk with their friends before bringing things up with their partners, right?", "It's precisely their place, and they're looking out for their friend. Who else is there to step in otherwise?  His wife is clearly oblivious, and the baby will take most of her energy and time from now on. It has somewhat been his last chance for having a birthday all about himself, and the extra gift is he that he had no say in the announcement. There's no mention of the husband complaining to the friend so that's just your head-canon.\n\nHonestly this sort of stuff is kind of why guys are afraid of commitment. A thousand little sacrifices have to be made and even if he's borne them silently without complaint he's still as shitty as she is for what?  Even if he had bitched to his friends about it, it would be entirely his right.  You'd have a lot more domestic abuse if people couldn't confide in their mates about their marital issues..", "> Your husband was happy with the announcement.\n\nHe was happy about his wife being pregnant, that doesn't equate to him being happy about her publicly announcing it before doing so in private.", "That's all the more reason she should have shared it with him first and then let him decide if he wanted to share it with everyone. She took something that should have been \"their\" news and turned it into hers.", "It really depends on husband but for me personally, I would be SO MAD if something as big as a pregnancy was shared with wider family and me at the same time. For me in a relationship, it\u2019s very important that that kind of thing is seen as \u2018our\u2019 private news that we share with each other before anyone else. In private. And then agree how we wanna tell everyone else together.\n\nI\u2019m a woman so this would never happen to me, but if my husband were to do this kind of thing with equally important personal news that affected us as a couple, I personally would be furious. These kind of one-sided announcements put pressure on the other person to act a certain way/in a certain role and I think it\u2019s really unfair.\n\nTo me it would just show a complete disregard for my input and feelings and conversation about a massive life event, instead jumping to an announcement for zero reason other than attention.", "She made it her news alone when she knew he didn't and SHE announced by herself.", "She didn't make it special for him she made it special for her.", "She should have told him privately before announcing it to wveryone", "The husbands bestie never liked her lol.", "Seems like it. Her husbands friend never really liked her.\n\nMaybe try reading again the husband didn\u2018t do anything nor did he indicate any unhappiness about the announcement.", "I read it as the friend that told her off has never liked OP", "You should read why her husband doesn\u2019t like celebrating his birthday. Also birthdays aren\u2019t for only children different people can celebrate a birthday with it being \u201crepetitive \u201c.", "He didn't like celebrating his birthday because his gma died a few days before it when he was a kid, so his parents didn't celebrate for a few years after and told him no when he asked about it.  Now we have him finally celebrating and his wife took all the attention.", "I have an issue with this, because I have had 4 miscarriages. \n\nNow if someone wants to wait that's fine and their right, but telling someone they shouldn't isn't ok. \n\nWas I just supposed to pretend I was ok and that k wasn't grieving after my losses. Some people want to grieve by themselves and that's fine, but for me each one was crushing because we were trying so long to have a baby and I needed to talk about it. In fact because I shared it and talked about it I let people who had been through similar and were able to give me hope for the future. \n\nThankfully I have two kids now but had it not been for meeting those people I would've given up hope.", "This is really antiquated advice and it only serves to keep women isolated and alone if they have a miscarriage.

Cause could be something big hence best freinds reaction", "I agree with everything the commenter above said, and I'd like to add: you being pregnant is happy news for the both of you, and the decision of whom to share it with, and when, and how, should be both of your decision.\n\nYou took that away from him and made it yours. On his birthday. Maybe he, too, would have liked to have the pleasant anticipation of how friends and family will react to the news, and shared that bit of secret joy with you. But he didn't get that, because you kept it all to yourself. That was selfish of you.", "Apologise, but do let him know what his friend said.", "Was he upset though or was it only his friend who was upset on his behalf?", "The very best thing you can learn is to have your own back. Have your own back. Trust that you made the decision based on knowledge and a kind heart. Trust that you had your husband\u2019s interests as well as yours in mind when you did it. Trust that your husband can speak for himself if he is bothered. Congratulations on your upcoming motherhood!", "One of my nieces birthday is 22Dec. She will be 12 this year. She almost never has anyone comes to her parties because everyone has gone on Christmas break and stuff like that even when we have a little earlier. We went to a couple birthday parties, the last few months for friends of hers, and she started to really feel down about it.  \n\nBecause that I was trying to think of a way to make her feel better, and I came up with an idea that everyone  including her seems to be behind. She is having a birthday in July. Now we\u2019ll still get her something small and probably a dinner on her actual birthday, but all her big gifts and party will be in a few weeks. It already looks like it\u2019ll be even better because she has had 2-3 times as many kids RSVP to this party than she has had show up the last two years.", "YTA Yes, It\u2019s a private thing between husband and wife at first. Imagine being blindsided with that news in front of everyone! He didn\u2019t even have a moment to take it all in. His mind must have been racing with that news coupled with the fact that his family is moving abroad, along with the fact that he doesn\u2019t like celebrating birthdays to begin with\u2026. Geez. Give the guy a break!", "And then let HIM announce it at the party, if he wants to.  \n\n\nOP is what I think this sub refers to as a 'main character'.

Thinking back to all the people I\u2019ve heard that said about\u2026I can\u2019t remember a single instance where I disagreed or thought it wrong. Could be some kind of retroactive bias, but usually attention-seeking is fairly obvious behavior.", "This is a personal choice.  Sure, some people don't want to tell people about losing the baby, but others don't want to go through pregnancy loss alone.  However, she definitely should let her partner weigh in on the timing decision before announcing it to everyone.", "I really hate when people say this. If you want to wait just in case of course that is your right. I know someone who didn't announce their pregnancy until they were 20 weeks. However, the reason is because you might lose the baby so you have to worry about what people think I hate. \n\nI have had 4 miscarriages and I never waited to tell people because I wanted to acknowledge the life however short it was and not pretend that everything was fine in my life and that I wasn't grieving.\n\nAgain nothing wrong if you want to wait, but there is also nothing wrong if you don't want to wait.", "Miscarriage thankfully doesn't carry the taboo it once did - many people these days choose to tell their nearest and dearest earlier than in the past as those will be the people they can talk to and get support from if they do have a miscarriage.", "As other people are saying here, it's a personal choice. One point I haven't seen brought up is how incredibly sick you can be in the first trimester and that you may need support, or just might not be able to hide it. I literally HAD to tell some people because I looked and felt like death. I felt so awful that I mostly stopped speaking. I couldn't handle phone or in person conversations over like a minute or two. If people hadn't known I was pregnant, they would have thought I needed to be rushed to the hospital. Personally, I'm someone who would hate having to tell everyone I had a miscarriage if I did, but I know if I get pregnant again, I'll have to just tell everyone because of how sick I get.", "Don\u2019t police how people handle their pregnancies. I told all of my close friends when I was pregnant. If something happened I wanted community to lean on. Telling women to not tell anyone only serves to silence women and ensures they suffer in silence.", "There aren\u2019t a fixed set rules when it comes to deciding when to tell people about a pregnancy. It\u2019s a personal choice.

This one I told my sister a day after we found out.  I always just phrase it as pregnant for now.  It really depends on the person, their history, and their comfort level.", "This was what I was going to say. Most people I've know who are pregnant haven't made it public until after the 12 week scan.  \nMy own experiences - my wife has had 3 miscarriages at or before 12 weeks - so I definitely wouldn't go around letting everyone know until things were a bit more definite.", "This.

Additionally, most people wait at least 2-3 months (maybe just tell it the mums or parents) before telling everyone and then on top of that her husband was not a big birthday party person, and that's how I got it his first party (ever in a while?) And she puts all the attention on herself...\n\nAlso in one of the comments it says that Op's husband did not get to celebrate because his grandma died around his birthday. And then the two years after his parents didn't celebrate and then he didn't ask anymore.

Then he finally has a party and op/wife takes his thunder away.\n\nAnd then also the friend's comments is that op can't stand it when not all the attention is on her.

Yeah, YTA.  Should have just told him privately to have a moment.  Maybe you don\u2019t see it this way because your moment was to yourself, but he now has to share his \u201cI\u2019m going to be a father moment\u201d not just with his wife, but his entire extended family, all because someone wanted to have a main character moment on someone else\u2019s birthday.", "Then honestly, you should not have taken away the attention from this birthday. Your heart may have been in the right place, but unfortunately husband more than likely feels that\u2019s yet another birthday not properly celebrated.", "Definitely YTA\n\nHe was just moving on and trusted that people he loved would be there to celebrate his birthday after all those years and you took his chance from him knowing all this. I think everyone knows the spotlight most likely changes after a pregnancy or an engagement kinda announcements. You hijacked his birthday.", "Well there's no wonder why your husband didn't react he's likely became numb to this type of thing and was happy about news he didn't wanna ruin it by being upset on how you done it. Op you really should been smarter definitely a yta now sorry", "Oh my goodness that's heartbreaking, poor thing. So as a kid he just gave up on having his birthday celebrated. \n I'm not going to pile onto you, I think you were well intentioned and excited. However, it really would be nice to make a bit more of a fuss of him. It doesn't even have to be about his birthday, just some gesture that lets him know how special he is to you. After all, that's the point of birthdays isn't it, it's an arbitrary date really, it's just taking a day to celebrate someone you love and let them know they are special to you. That they are loved and you're happy they exist. I would apologise for not telling him about the pregnancy alone first and make plans to do something special that celebrates him. Surprise him with something meaningful.", "I say I\u2019m too old for birthdays but really that\u2019s not true. I was born on my grandmother\u2019s 70th birthday, so we share a birthday and a name. I was raised by her and my grandfather and she lived to be 100, so we shared 30 birthdays together. I remember one year no one remembered it was my 10th birthday (it was granny\u2019s 80th), and that was the last year I reminded others it was also my birthday. I suspect your husband felt similarly when he stopped asking for birthday parties from his parents. If you didn\u2019t leave out that vital piece of information to make yourself not sound so in the wrong, then you really need to work on your awareness. Knowing your husband\u2019s grandmother died shortly before his birthday, then his family didn\u2019t celebrate his birthday for a number of years, also that he quit asking his family about his birthday, and finally that he doesn\u2019t want to celebrate now should have been the signals that his birthday isn\u2019t the day to add more drama (even if it\u2019s \u201chappy\u201d drama). Perhaps see a counselor or therapist.", "Yeah but it\u2019s not like everyone is going to gather around him and ask him how far along he is, etc. all the questions about pregnancy and excitement usually revolve around the pregnant person.\nAt least from my experience anyway", "My goodness no!!  Is that true?!? I had no idea!!\n\nSarcasm aside - had she told him prior to the party about her pregnancy then let him decide to announce or not there\u2019d be no issue because he could have said \u201chey let\u2019s do that another day so I can enjoy my day\u201d\n\nOP announced it to everyone with no warning to him and then took the focus off the birthday man and onto herself.  Even if she didn\u2019t necessarily mean to.", "That's easy to forget tbh.\n\n>my pregnancy", "Again, very true. Perhaps I could have phrased it better. My intention was that given the potential risks early on, it should really be a husband and wife decision to make those early announcement to others. She might be okay with it, and he might have wanted to have waited. The conversation should have been had together so they are on the same page.\n\nI get being excited though and wanting to share the news so they have that support system in place. \n\n(I\u2019m probably being too cautious since I\u2019ve had five miscarriages)", "I agr\u00e9e with this.

My dad suspects he did it because he was upset he knew hadn\u2019t gotten my dad a present and felt I made him look bad, which he agrees is bizarre behaviour in the context above.\n\nMy parents also have a pattern of minimizing my brother\u2019s bad behaviour, even when it\u2019s blatant.

I hope youre doing well now \ud83d\udc9c", "I agree. We had multiple miscarriages before the doctor figured out I didn't produce enough progesterone to carry and I never waited. My ex would've never been upset about me surprising him with the news in front of others either. However, everyone is different and I knew that about him. \n\nI think when/how you announce is a personal decision and you definitely have to take your partners feelings into account. There's no wrong way to do it unless you're hurting someone in the process.", "It's not about worrying what people will think, it's about not having to deal with telling people and fielding their emotions if you lose the baby.\n\nI lost a baby at 6 weeks at it was so hard.  I can't imagine having to deal with other people at all around the issue.", ">However, the reason is because you might lose the baby so you have to worry about what people think I hate.\n\nIt has nothing to do with what people will think, and everything to do with not wanting to rip open the wound each and every time the random 3rd cousin or other distant relative asks about how the pregnancy is going.\n\n3 here, and it made way more sense for us to wait.", "I actually had no idea that it was because miscarriages carry a stigma (although in retrospect, unfortunately yeah they do)\n\nMy parents told me that it was a superstition thing not to tell anyone for a while so that nothing would happen to the baby. When they told me about my brother, they told me not to tell anyone, so obviously I immediately blabbed to my babysitter the next day. So maybe after that, they made up the \u201csuperstition\u201d so I wouldn\u2019t go blabbing to anyone else lol.", "Hahaha YUP. Improving their lives and ours all at the same time!", "Oh yeah, for sure. I don\u2019t think it was malicious, but I agree with all of this and it was clearly a poor and strange choice. (I\u2019ve heard arguments about changing pregnancy announcement culture so that women don\u2019t have to suffer through miscarriages in secret but I have not been and have no intention of being pregnant, so no dogs in this fight.)\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Reddit has taught me, it\u2019s that people consistently make very strange and inappropriate decisions about when and how to announce pregnancies and engagements.", "Any time somebody says: \"they never liked me anyway\" you can deel the dismissive and self centered person behind it.", "From the woman\u2019s pov maybe. But his bros and male relatives should have been all over him in their manly way of congratulating, talking/dreaming about all the cool things he will do with his child as a dad. It\u2019s just as exciting for the man. We just had our fourth and my husband got WAY more attention about and throughout this pregnancy than I did as a stay at home mom. He works from home so I hear him on the phone with his team all the time, \u201cHow you been sleeping? Congrats, she\u2019s beautiful. Great job on that one. I bet you deserve a break, boss.\u201d His guys have been treating him constantly, taking him out for lunch, drinks, golf, baseball games.I\u2019m not complaining either, he\u2019s a wonderful dad and husband and he deserves it all with how supportive he is to me and the kids.", "\"no let's do that another day so I can enjoy my day\"\n\nWTF, literally cannot imagine this response from a grown person happy to be a first time father. It's just weird.", ">Sarcasm aside - had she told him prior to the party about her pregnancy then let him decide to announce or not there\u2019d be no issue because he could have said \u201chey let\u2019s do that another day so I can enjoy my day\u201d  \n>  \n>OP announced it to everyone with no warning to him and then took the focus off the birthday man and onto herself.  Even if she didn\u2019t necessarily mean to.\n\nAll of that is perfectly reasonable, but it has nothing to do with;\n\n>You don't make someone else's special day or celebration about you - and that's what you did.\n\nThat telling the the father beforehand in private should have been the correct way to go has very little to do with 'outshining' someone on their birthday.", "She\u2019s the pregnant person.", "No this is so true! Always talk to your partner first. If you need to talk to friends, literally tell them you\u2019re venting and that you might change your feelings/attitude after venting. My friends are the ride or die type. Once our significant others do something hurtful or we get into a fight and you come to our group in the heat of the moment\u2026hopefully the significant other doesn\u2019t get dragged to kingdom come by the time the hangout is over. I know that my group isn\u2019t the only type to function in this way because they\u2019re trying to protect you. It\u2019s hard to convince them that the person is decent otherwise UNLESS you preface that you\u2019re venting ESPECIALLY when it\u2019s early on in the relationship. It\u2019s easy to make snap judgements based off of one incident and everyone has different thresholds for what they will and won\u2019t tolerate. \n\nBest to keep it to your significant other rather than running to family and friends (unless it\u2019s abuse, then please tell anyone who can listen and or get you to safety). Otherwise there\u2019s really no need to involve others in your relationship issues.", "And that he never really got to celebrate his birthday. This was the first time in awhile that he got one with his family .", "This is the correct explanation and definitely not a \u201csoft\u201d YTA, but a hard one. What she did was incredibly narcissistic. Didn\u2019t even tell the father first in private and made the decision to tell everyone else on her own acting like this is her baby and not both of them. For her to have missed both of these things is extremely telling. Could you imagine if the roles were reversed and the guy did that, everyone would be jumping down his throat", "No, he could have his back without being a dick to his best friends wife. You don\u2019t disrespect your friend\u2019s wife. He could\u2019ve said it differently.", "Why not being up the friend? I would absolutely tell my husband if one of his friends said something like that to me. Doesn't matter if they were right or wrong, but I would still discuss with my husband.", "It wasn't his friend's place to come at her like that. If he was upset, he's a grown man and can have that conversation with his wife himself.\n\nHis friend isn't a part of their marriage. That's why she should bring it up. \n\nHe could be completely unbothered and the friend could just be assuming.", "How can you know for sure that he\u2019s actually happy about the pregnancy? You forced him into a situation where he had to either look happy or look like a dick in front of his family and friends.\nTelling him at the same time you told family and friends suggests a pathological degree of self-centeredness and a complete disregard for your partner.", "He wasn\u2019t upset or didn\u2019t seem upset? Cause it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve said a word to him. Considering you didn\u2019t factor in how significant a pregnancy announcement is for your partner let alone in this context, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re particularly good at picking up on peoples needs, particularly emotional. \n\nThe way you speak reveals some things about how you think, like how everything is filtered through how it affects you. Your husbands best friend may have been correct, and if he is then it\u2019s probably not something you can accept/recognise, which would explain why your immediate instinct was to internally disagree, but avoid continuing the discussion to keep the heat off you. Likely the same reason you didn\u2019t tell him in the first place, ignored the friend, and posted to strangers on the internet. All of these things avoid direct communication and keep you out of the spotlight.\n\nIm not saying this is intentional or even conscious, it\u2019s just what\u2019s playing out. If this sounds familiar or you think it might be even just a little relevant, there are many resources and support networks you can reach out to! It doesn\u2019t automatically make you a bad person at all, and doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not also overwhelmed and excited by such positive news. \n\nPregnancy and happy hormones are definitely in play here, as well as being so young! Whether this observation holds truth or not please be kind to yourself and partner.", "Are you sure? There's an idea that you should \"never upset a pregnant woman,\" so maybe he didn't say anything. \n\n\nAre you otherwise planning on including him as a parent? Going to doctor's appointments? In the future, actually discussing with him information and whether or not he is comfortable sharing, who he is comfortable sharing with, etc? Hopefully it's not the case, but if something is wrong with the baby, do you just announce it to his family?", "I know if you\u2019re a Reddit browser people acting as well adjusted polite individuals is not the norm but your hubby really had no option but to act happy whether he was or not. Even if he didn\u2019t have a problem with it you\u2019re still TA. \n\nThat\u2019s news you tell your partner in private and have a nice moment together. Later you can announce the news together, you took that from him. I\u2019m not saying you had bad intentions but I don\u2019t understand why you felt the need to tell everyone including your partner in front of everyone on his birthday.", "I think others have said it already but give more mindful thought to him.  It doesn't cost you anything. YTA but only a little as I'm sure what you did was born of excitement not any malice.", "Sorry to say he is probably use to his birthday meaning nothing through the events of the past and so is use to it and that is why he isn\u2019t upset. \n\nCongratulations and I would say soft AH but completely unintentional and forgivable", "Do you actually KNOW he wasn\u2019t frustrated or sad?\n\nHe may just have been polite because you put him on the spot in front of everyone. \n\nPerhaps his friend is sticking up for your husband, because he knows your husband won\u2019t stick up for himself?", "Yeah NTA you know your husband better than anyone else.", "Then his friend can stfu.", "That friend is no friend. You should tell your husband about his rude and intrusive behavior", "No. I\u2019m sorry, but you don\u2019t get to decide how long someone else waits to tell people they are expecting. I agree with the other redditors about telling her husband first, but plenty of people don\u2019t  wait until after the first trimester. That\u2019s a personal choice for every expecting couple to make.", "Actually, finally, the social norm about this is changing. When people don't announce until later in the pregnancy, it (for many) means that if there is a miscarriage, they can't easily reach out to their community for support, because no one knew they were pregnant to begin with. It also creates an atmosphere where miscarriages, despite being incredibly common, are treated like a deep dark secret.", "That\u2019s a very outdated \u201crule\u201d. It\u2019s become far more common and accepted over the years for people to share their pregnancies early because even if a loss or complication does happen they want the support of their friends and family through it rather than suffering alone and treating it like it\u2019s something shameful. This isn\u2019t universal\u2014not everyone wants people around them to know\u2014but like I said, way more common.", "I have to disagree just because things can go wrong doesn't mean you can't announce it. It's entirely up to the person. There's no shame in miscarriage. Lots of times I've found out people were pregnant in the first trimester but I'd never think bad of them if they lost it, just offer support. \nHowever, I'd maybe get it confirmed by a doctor and tell my partner before I tell anyone else.", "I mean. That\u2019s a personal choice. Nothing says you can\u2019t and part of that expectation just forces pregnancy loss and the grief associated to be a private matter and it doesn\u2019t have to be.", "Oh stop with that.  There is no such rule, and we are well past the days of women being required to act like pregnancy loss is a shameful secret.", "Well that\u2019s just not true. Sure lots of folks chose to wait, but it\u2019s completely fine for people to announce early if they want. They just should be aware that announcing early might also mean announcing a loss. For some folks this doesn\u2019t bother them and they might decide they would have shared the loss anyways. For others, keeping it quiet until 12 weeks feels safer. \n\nI still think the wife is the asshole for telling him in front of everyone, but this whole first trimester it must be a secret rule is just made up. People don\u2019t have to follow it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEdited to change moss to loss. \ud83e\udd23", "I disagree, if you\u2018re okay with \u201eunannouncing\u201c to all of these people you can do it as early as you want. Also, a pregnancy can still go wrong much later (even in the stages when you can\u2018t really hide it anymore).\n\nStill, announcing to anyone should be a shared decision between both partners. She took this opportunity from him (adding to not giving him the opportunity to process something that huge first), so OP YTA.", "According to his best friend, but according to most people it would be shared joy- as it certainly seems to have been.", "yeh r/IAmTheMainCharacter is full of videos of people just having a good time lol", "Sorry, I meant in real life. Internet doesn\u2019t count in the slightest, haha. I mostly mean that if the friend that knows OP in real life is saying this, then I\u2019m inclined to believe it\u2019s true, and that\u2019s reinforced by OP\u2019s own post. She might as well have titled it \u201cAITA for asking for attention at husband\u2019s birthday party\u201d because that\u2019s literally what she did. \n\nPregnancy announcements are one of the situations where it\u2019s okay to seek attention, but there are generally some very strict cultural guidelines on how to go about it. Not announcing at someone else\u2019s wedding, or engagement or graduation party, or baby shower are examples. Announcing at your own husband\u2019s event is fine, but only if you\u2019ve told him first (or, possibly, if you guys have been actively trying to get pregnant for a period of time and you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he will be ecstatic - in which case that should be part of OP\u2019s original post).", "Hmm, interesting. I do think that this is something guys are criticized for, though maybe not using that specific phrase as you say.", "I agree with you.  I said she shouldn't announce it until talking with him.", "Yes I agree with you. I don't think she should've sprung this on her husband and all the family. I always told my husband first. \n\nI am replying specifically to the part where the commenter was saying she should wait until after a scan because pregnancy loss is more common than people think.", "I am so sorry for you losses. I understand what your saying. I think everyone should have that choice, for your mental health waiting was best for you and that's the choice you needed to make. \n\nHowever, we are told all the time don't tell anyone until 12 weeks in case you lose the baby. Women should not be told they need to wait because some like me didn't want to. I needed the people around me because grieving in private was bad for my mental health", "Congratulations to you sister \ud83c\udf89! \n\nThank you, I am doing much better now. I have two beautiful boys now (almost 3 and 15 months.)", "\nThat's why I specifically said if you want to wait that is completely fine. I know not everyone feels the same way. Like I said I know someone who didn't announce their pregnancy until 20 weeks becuase she had previously lost a baby, which she lost at 17 weeks. \n\nI have an issue when people tell other people not to announce it until 12 weeks in case you lose the  baby, some people need to have a community around them to help them through the grieving process. Others prefer to grieve in private. \n\nNeither is wrong but we need to stop telling people they need to wait in case they lose the baby, the couple should make that choice for themselves.", "True but also thinking about all this I think it goes more into YTA then small YTA. And I get it op is probably very excited; however, taken everything into consideration (what we know), it was definitely not the right time to announce it.", "And? Both of them made this baby, both of them should have a say. Yes, she will be carrying the baby but neither husband nor wife should be making unilateral decisions.", "If one of my friends came at my partner like that behind my back? I would definitely want to know.", "Nah. You must have awful friends if none of them went to bat for you over a major event. \n\nThe friend had every right to voice their thoughts. Especially because a best friend would be privy to information we are not.", "Frankly this early is just stupid regardless of how you feel about the trimester thing.", "I have had kids for a long time and never heard of this bullshit about waiting till Reddit.", "I announced my pregnancy immediately for the first child. EVERY SINGLE conversation from friends, neighbors, coworkers, etc after that for the whole 9 months consisted of whether the baby was moving, was it a boy or a girl, what\u2019s it\u2019s name\u2026 10 people a day with the same questions. Next baby, I waited as long as possible. Lol", ">It's entirely up to the person.\n\nI think it's up to all parents. (Exept for anyone little more than a sperm donor).\n\nThat's why I think telling your partner first is so important.", "Absolutely! I will not be telling my parents right away because they would probably blame me if a miscarriage occured, but I will be telling my closest girlfriends since I would likely want their support if the worst happened", "Yeah, the best friend does seem unusual. Almost like he has a similar outlook to the OP. \n\nAlso the idea that SHE and the baby became the centre of attention after the announcement is strange too... I would have expected the expectant family to become the centre of attention / conversation. Having a baby is a big deal for husbands too, as is celebrating it when they are in a room full of their friends...", "Yeah I don\u2019t really disagree regarding the post. Op should have told her husband first and they should have announced it together. \n\nBut also, has anyone else noticed that since covid people are acting a lot more online out in the real world? I mean I live in a techy area so it\u2019s always been there, but I feel like lately I\u2019ve had wayyy too many conversations with random people in real life that feel like a reddit or twitter conversation lol, it\u2019s terrible", "Maybe that's justifiable for HER closest family and friends, but not HIS.", "I\u2019m sorry your parents would blame you! That\u2019s so wild. \n\nGood luck in any future pregnancies and if you do ever have a loss I sure hope no one ever makes you feel like it\u2019s your fault."]}
