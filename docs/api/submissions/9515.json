At 8pm my nephew was sleeping and I was periodically checking his temperature and having him drink some gatorade.\n\nBetween having to work a full day while having to take care of him I was spent. I decided to crack a few beers open to decompress. I asked if my girlfriend could watch him until my brother came and she agreed. So I was having a few beers and watching some sports until my brother shows up. He walks in and sees my nephew sleeping on the couch while my girlfriend was sitting next to him and sees me drinking. \n\nAfter explaining the whole situation he gets pissed at me since I was drinking while his son was sick. I said he was being watched by my girlfriend (who btw has babysitting experience). He said he didn\u2019t trust her and he only trusts me. I told him he was being an irresponsible father for not responding to a single one of my calls.

Saying it to anyone drinking ever would of course be ignorant.", "Like I said, it might be fine and I, me as in I as a person, get anxious when people use it to decompress. Decompressing from work or life is of course really important, I just think that if alcohol is the only way you do it then try to find another way. \n\nMy brother started with having a taste for good beer. Then needed a few beers to \u201cdecompress\u201d from his stressful job, then it was the only way to decompress and it wasn\u2019t two beers anymore. Then he needed alcohol to sleep, then to recoup from a hangover and then one night he almost burned the apartment down with me in it. So yes.

He absolutely would have been sober enough to make medical decisions and his GF could drive to the hospital.\n\nAlso, the implication of this is as an emergency contact you have to always be sober because you might have to make a medical decision. Thats untenable.", "There was someone else responsible there, OP\u2019s girlfriend. The kid could have been in hospital or dead, the dad couldn\u2019t answer the phone from 12pm-8pm?

It's not reasonable for you to be sober constantly in case of an emergency, but it is reasonable to want a certain level of sobriety if a kid is actively in your care.\n\n\\--Kid had a fever severe enough to send him home. Yes he was sleeping but any parent can tell you a kid can take a turn for the worse quickly that requires an ER visit.\n\nI have to wonder if OP's brother has an issue less with the beers and more with the gf.", "But that\u2019s no excuse for OP, don\u2019t want to responsibility don\u2019t sign up for it", "Well because of covid school policy is to send anyone with any covid esque symptoms so he had a fever that wasn\u2019t sever but it\u2019s school policy to send them home", "> Kid had a fever severe enough to send him home.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily saying much - some schools have pretty strict fever policies!", "Possibly or he could be trying to get in front of OP being angry with him.", "He only had 1.5 beers.
