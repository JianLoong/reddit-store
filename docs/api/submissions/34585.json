Nala is big dog, but she was so skiny that she weighted only 15kgs (where normally her sized dog should weight about 35kgs).

They agreed as \u201cwe do not need her here\u201d.\n\nFast forward to November - Nala is getting healthy, she is the sweetest dog, usually very calm but seems to be having separation issues - she starts howling at night if no one has been giving her at least some attention at daytime. Now my sister asked me if I could watch her kids (boy 5 and boy 3) for a few days while she went on an anniversary trip with her husband, and I agreed.

That's mean beyond words. Feeling angry and betrayed would be perfectly valid in this situation.\n\nYou are NTA for telling them that they shouldn't have taken Nala if this is how they were going to behave at the first hurdle. I'm so sorry that they've done this to you. I'm glad you've been able to move out. See if you can connect the shelter and explain to someone what happened. You can give them evidence (photos, social media posts) of your progress with Nala since you adopted her, your sister can vouch for your necessary absence during that time. Your rapid change of address, landlord's willingness and any relevant SMS conversations with your parents about their surrendering Nala will demonstrate your case.

Mainly because, their house their rules. I personally feel, they didn't like Nala after some time and when you were gone, they took the opportunity to get rid of her. I think they kept her because of you. You were in a bad position financially and they must have wanted for you to feel at home. However, once you were gone their detachment from the dog and the howling made them take a spontaneous decision \\*\\*that they shouldn't have taken\\*\\*. Their approach wasn't really good, but I think they loved you so much that they didn't want you to move out and be at a bad place for the dog. In their head, they still think that they did you a favour. I feel bad for what happened to you, and I feel that the parents were insensitive about your feelings regarding the dog. I think they are hiding something like it was getting too expensive to have you and the extra dog in the house or something. This seems like a pre-meditated thing that they thought was for your sake.

We saw that if we let her be for a whole day (ofc we feed her and try talking, but no petting or playing because she was too scared at that time), then at night she would start howling. But after she got friendly with us (sorry, lack of better words) and we started playing and petting her, and in general communicating - she was not howling anymore. My guess is that maybe they ignored her when I was not around, hence the howling started", "I asked the OP, and they said that the parents basically liked the dog but gave it away because they snapped because of the howling- I am sorry this whole thing isn't making any sense to me till now.", "I did say in my original comment that there is going to be information missing and that we are only hearing OP's side, HOWEVER, as per what OP has said in their comments in the original post and on other comment threads, they had a whole conversation with their parents about the dog before taking it in, and they asked their parents of they were happy to dogsit for a few days (OP was only away for 4 days, not whole months like you are implying) and they explicitly said yes, and even texted OP back during that time to say that the dog was fine, presumably after they had taken it to a shelter.\n\nWe can only make judgements based on the information that we have, even if we assume some information is missing, and the information that we have implies that the parents were extremely dishonest with OP, telling them they were fine with the dog when they weren't and telling them they were happy to dogsit when they weren't, and in doing so actually prevented OP from finding an alternative.", "> My guess is that maybe they ignored her when I was not around, hence the howling started\n\nThis case isn't making any sense to me... ;-;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they were playful when you were there how can they completely ignore the dog. I am sorry but to me this case makes little to no sense. I feel it is perhaps because of the 3000-character limit.", "To add, I never called the bad people, I said that they have been dishonest, which they objectively have, and have technically committed fraud and theft, which again they objectively have.", ">I feel that the parents were driven to do this and were at the breaking point. It makes 0 sense how horrible parents would take in their child and also let the child adopt a dog and also keep up with a howling dog. \n\nI feel like this is pure, unfounded speculation. Why did they say yes? To the dog and then to dog sitting? Why not give OP an ultimatum if it was so bad? (if you 2ant to keep the dog you need to move out, for eg?)\n\nIn what world do people who own the property not have recourse as to who and what is living on the property without resorting to legal fraud and theft of property, exactly? \n\n>They are hiding something crucial to the case. It is not like OP asked the parents to dog sit their dog for a few days the parents had the dog for so many months (in their property\n\nAgain, pure speculation. You don't know that. You're assuming. And even if the dog was howling 24/7 and destroying things around the house, they still had no right to use OP's name without consent or steal their dog. Not in any situation. There were other, *legal* ways of dealing with it if it was that bad. But since they resorted to illegal actions, OP is well within their rights to file a report.", "I am not saying you called them. I said they don't seem like bad people. What I was trying to say is that this story/ case is not making any sense TBH. It's like \"make it make sense\" type of thing. For ex, it makes no sense why parents were happy with the dog but then gave it away the minute OP stepped out, even though the howling wasn't something new? The case is very confusing and IDK why people are calling the parents an AH when the case itself isn't making sense :/", "Girl, aren't you assuming too that whatever the OP said in the post is it. Like that's it- Period. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes things don't make sense. If it made to you then cool ig.", "Generally, humans don't make sense, but this case actually kind of does to me. There are exactly two possibilities regarding this case 'making sense' - either OP is being dishonest about something or withholding information, or the parents were dishonest and withheld information. As I've already said, we can only go by the information that we have available, and if new information becomes available I am happy to re-evaluate my stance, but your comment that OP should have known their parents had an issue with the dog seems to be based an an assumption and not the information we currently have available.\n\nGiven that this wouldn't be the first time in history that somebody had an issue with something but didn't say so for whatever reason until they hit a breaking point, then acted like everybody should have known they have a problem, so I don't have too much difficulty believing that the parents said that they were okay with the dog when they weren't and said that they were okay with dogsitting when they weren't, and they probably even thought they were doing the right thing when they actually weren't.\n\nAnd surrendering someone else's dog to a shelter, not even giving them any sort of alternative (i.e. move out by this date or the dog goes), is a shitty thing to do.\n\nAlso, we don't know where OP is from other than the fact they aren't a native English speaker, and some cultures take a more negative view on telling somebody when there is an issue or have more of an expectation to just 'suck it up' to maintain peace, which definitely could have influenced the parents behaviour.", ">Girl, aren't you assuming too that whatever the OP said in the post is it. Like that's it- Period. \n\n\nYes, I'm basing it on the information we have. Not speculation. \n\n>Sometimes things don't make sense\n\nYeah, mostly when people are projecting their experiences onto something. \n\n. If it made to you then cool ig. \n\nSo you're saying if the dog was acting up that we don't know of, it's okay to steal it and commit fraud?\n\n Honestly this part i don't get. What part of: no matter how the dog or OP behaved nothing justifies theft and legal fraud?\nLike what situation can you imagine where this is an acceptable response from the parents? The dog set the house on fire? Attacked someone?"]}
