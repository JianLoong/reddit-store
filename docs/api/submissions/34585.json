Nala is big dog, but she was so skiny that she weighted only 15kgs (where normally her sized dog should weight about 35kgs). I heard about her from my friends, who are owner\u2019s neighbours, and went to ask them if they would give Nala for adoption. They agreed as \u201cwe do not need her here\u201d.\n\nFast forward to November - Nala is getting healthy, she is the sweetest dog, usually very calm but seems to be having separation issues - she starts howling at night if no one has been giving her at least some attention at daytime. Now my sister asked me if I could watch her kids (boy 5 and boy 3) for a few days while she went on an anniversary trip with her husband, and I agreed. Everything went well, Nala was at my parent\u2019s, 4 days have passed and my sister returned. I went home to my parents and haven\u2019t noticed Nala. Went to look if she was in the backyard, but she was not there. \n\nI waited until my parents got back from the store and asked them where the dog is. They said she was in a shelter in a different city. I asked them why, and their explanation was \u201cShe was bothering us with her howling\u201d. I got really attached to Nala so I got extremely upset about it, and asked again and again crying why my parents would do this. They said that this dog was not theirs so it didn\u2019t bother or hurt them, and they don\u2019t see the issue here, because she was making them uncomfortable at their own place. I shouted at them, saying that they can\u2019t behave like this and that they shouldn\u2019t have taken her in if it was such a problem for them, and what were they thinking giving her away to the shelter when I was only gone for 4 days. They could have called me and I would come by to check on her if she was misbehaving or anything, but every time I called they said that she\u2019s great. We got into a fight and now everyone in my family are telling me that I\u2019m the asshole for mistreating my parents and no one really wants to keep in touch with me. \n\nI have tried going to that shelter to take her back, as I am now renting my own place and landlord is kind enough to let me keep a pet, but as my mother turned Nala in under my name - shelter cannot let me adopt her\u2026\n\nSo please, help me understand, AITA?", "created_utc": 1704710052, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191iamk/aita_for_telling_by_parents_they_shouldnt_have/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a very shitty behavior that they gave your dog behind your back , and they AGREED at adoption . You can't adopt an animal and start ditching him like that , especially after a affectionate bond was created .\n\n They could have talked with you and wait  you go on your own place .", "Involve police and note it as fraud as your mother pretended to be you when turning in the dog in a different city.

Your parents should not have agreed to let you bring a dog home if they weren't capable of talking to you about any issues they had with your dog. It is absolutely not normal parenting behaviour to surrender their child's *wanted*, *loved* and *cared for* pet, without even telling the child that the pet was causing a problem. That's mean beyond words. Feeling angry and betrayed would be perfectly valid in this situation.\n\nYou are NTA for telling them that they shouldn't have taken Nala if this is how they were going to behave at the first hurdle. I'm so sorry that they've done this to you. I'm glad you've been able to move out. See if you can connect the shelter and explain to someone what happened. You can give them evidence (photos, social media posts) of your progress with Nala since you adopted her, your sister can vouch for your necessary absence during that time. Your rapid change of address, landlord's willingness and any relevant SMS conversations with your parents about their surrendering Nala will demonstrate your case. Most shelters would prefer dogs go back to good owners, so it's probably possible to convince them. Best of luck.", "NTA-but if your mom used your name behind your back in a legal capacity, that's fraud. So go to the police, report what happened to your dog (pets are legally viewed as property) and then go to the shelter with a copy of the report (as they were the ones who allowed the fraud to happen, they might also be liable which can make them very co-operative).", "NTA, this would be an unforgivable situation for me. Especially because your dumb parents didn't talk to you ahead of time to make it known how they felt. \n\nInvolve the police. They stole your dog and turned it in to the shelter under your name.

Mainly because, their house their rules. I personally feel, they didn't like Nala after some time and when you were gone, they took the opportunity to get rid of her. I think they kept her because of you. You were in a bad position financially and they must have wanted for you to feel at home. However, once you were gone their detachment from the dog and the howling made them take a spontaneous decision \\*\\*that they shouldn't have taken\\*\\*. Their approach wasn't really good, but I think they loved you so much that they didn't want you to move out and be at a bad place for the dog. In their head, they still think that they did you a favour. I feel bad for what happened to you, and I feel that the parents were insensitive about your feelings regarding the dog. I think they are hiding something like it was getting too expensive to have you and the extra dog in the house or something. This seems like a pre-meditated thing that they thought was for your sake. What I am trying to say is: Good intention but Bad action.", "YTA. You wanted the dog. You have no right to expect other people to care for it. If you went out of town, you should have boarded the dog somewhere. You sound entitled. It is your dog and your responsibility. You just left and assumed your parents would care for it.

There is clearly some bias. Let me explain:\n\n(1) How the OP never saw that the parents saw the dog as a problem? Makes no sense. They were living with them for months. \n\n(2) OP knows the dog has separation anxiety and has possibly trauma or something like that. Yet, they decide to dispose the headache on the parents. Why not give it to a dog sitter? What if the dog has a heart attack or starts attacking people due to the anxiety?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would NEVER adopt an animal at someone else's place. Find your own place and then do it. It seems that the OP talked the parents into getting the dog. If the parents never loved OP, they would have REFUSED OP to move in let alone keep a dog. OP also seems weird for getting a traumatized dog when OP isn't completely independent themself.", "I think this isn't good advice as then OP is forever cutting ties with their mother.

Do you see a pet as a family member or just a disposable animal you can replace anytime time with a better one.", "OP said in the post that she has moved out and that the shelter will not let her adopt as the mother turned the dog in in OP's name - which IS form fraud, and makes me wonder what else the mother might be willing to do in OPs name, especially since there appears to have been a lot of dishonesty from the parents around this - they told OP they can have the dog, they told OP they were happy to dogsit, they texted back and forth to say that the dog was okay at home, and considering the short timescale, it seems like they had planned this, and while there couldn't always be information we are missing since we only get OPs side, it doesn't appear that the parents voiced and concerns or complaints.\n\nBest thing for OP to do would be to make it clear to the shelter that their mother committed fraud (and technicallyalso theft), since that's what she did, but they might demand to see proof of that in the form of a police report.

And the only way to get his dog back, (and be able to adopt from shelters in the future, as people who have given up pets to shelters are usually disqualified in the future) is to report his mother for fraud.\n\n Besides if she feels comfortable commiting this kind of fraud, what else would she be comfortable committing? Taking out credit cards in OP's name?\n\nIf his mom wants to cut ties over the fraud she committed, why would that be bad for OP? It's not like OP will ever trust her again. She already irreparable damaged their relationship with her stunt. She is a liar, a fraud and a sneak. Why on earth would someone want a relationship with someone like that? She literally illegally gave up OP's pet to a shelter. If anyone in my family did that, you bet I would never speak to them again outside of court.", "So what? If she wants her child i.

The best type of relationship with a mother like this is no relationship.", "I feel that OP's parents never had pet dogs (maybe kept stray dogs in the backyard during the day) or didn't have their own pet dogs at that point of time.

It will 9/10 times lead to complications. What if they become too attached with the animal? What if because of the animal you no longer have a roof over your head? What if they don't take care of the animal and let it bit kids and thus get injected?

Like the whole fast forward to November is kinda fishy. I feel there is a lot more to the story which makes it very hard to judge IMHO.", "The likelihood of being caught is low but not zero, and in some countries it's not unusual for shelters to run background checks or inspect the housing of adopters, specifically to avoid animals being returned. However, it's down to OP and their accomplice to weigh up the risk and reward if they want to go through with it, and if I thought there were an undue risk for OP O wouldn't have made the suggestion in the first place.", "Your pet = your headache. And nowhere OP said they were paying their parents for the dog or paying rent or anything. Parents are wrong but due to their mistakes OP has no rights in the matter.", "I am sorry but this makes me confused because you said she had howling problems even before you left- do you think someone manipulated your parents? That is the only thing that makes sense as to why they snapped. Or maybe some altercation you both had?", "One incident which is about her going behind his back, using his name and dropping HIS dog at a shelter. This isnt like she forgot the stove on.", "Listen, the parents took OP in for months and don't seem like bad people, otherwise OP would and should have moved out earlier. They didn't like the dog. I am confused about how OP never saw that? I mean it wasn't like she lived there for a few days. For them to give away the dog seems like they saw it as a nuisance. I think it was a compromise they were ready to do until OP left and they became solely responsible for the dog. I am not saying giving it away was a good decision but there is a lot of grey area IMO. I feel things might have happened between summer and fall. That is a huge time gap.", "OP does have rights. You can't legally give away or sell other people's property. (which is what pets are classified as usually).\n You definitely can't use someone else's name on legal matters without their consent (and usually a notarized consent document, at least where I am) \n\nOP can and should report their mother for fraud for using their name without their consent and for theft of property. And the shelter might be liable as well for not checking ID/contacting the actual legal owner.", "I feel that the parents were driven to do this and were at the breaking point. It makes 0 sense how horrible parents would take in their child and also let the child adopt a dog and also keep up with a howling dog. \n\nParents could have gone the easier route of letting the dog free or setting it off at a random location or kicking OP out. This case makes no sense. There is more to the story, and I know the sub reddit doesn't allow for the other side to make a post, but this is one of the instances where without both sides it is impossible to see who is wrong or right. Given on the info OP gave, I don't believe them fully. They are hiding something crucial to the case. It is not like OP asked the parents to dog sit their dog for a few days the parents had the dog for so many months (in their property)."]}
