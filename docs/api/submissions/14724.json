But it sounds familiar, someone who is usually able to be lighthearted and casual but gets really squirrely around taking blame for things they broke and lying as an immediate reaction. The thing is like you're saying, it's how he's playing it off that's making him TA. It takes work but you can admit fault and explain the initial lying reaction if you're willing to open up to people about why you're defensive, take ownership for lying and provide solutions to the problem, and be aware that the other person is within their right to be upset. Idk how other than very clearly using those same words that OP could let the roommate know it's ok to do this but yeah. It's all work that the roomie has to undertake for themselves."]}
