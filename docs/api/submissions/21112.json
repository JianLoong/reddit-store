Me and his mom were divorced by then but , I always made every effort to be a good dad and  spend time with him while on leave.  When i left  the Army ive spent every moment i could with my boy. We still have a good relationship. Now my ex remarried pretty quick to a nice guy \"Steven\" which of course he did treat Karter well and I'm not knocking that even though we don't get along  but,  I'm his actual dad.\n\nKarter's getting married to his fiance \"Clark\"  25M at the end of next month. My ex and Steven are a kinda strapped for cash and Clark's family isn't exactly wealthy so they asked me if I'd foot the bill. I agreed cause of course I'd do anything for my boy. Come to find out yesterday that  Karter wants both me and Steven to walk him down the aisle. That honestly really pissed me off you know cause I'm Karter's actual dad and I'm paying for everything and I've always been there for him. It hurt alot that he'd want some step parent to walk him down the aisle. We got into a huge fight about this morning  and I told him that I wouldn't pay for the wedding if Steven walks him down the aisle. My ex is pissed and thanks I'm being selfish but , my dad thinks I should push harder.

You should be *thankful* that son's stepdad treated your child well enough during the times he wasn't with you that he wants both of you with him on his special day. \n\nDon't treat it like some sort of competition or make him have to choose between two people he loves on a day that is all about celebrating love.", "I just want to say how awesome you are for even wanting to walk your son down the isle. As a gay guy, let me just say, I love that you\u2019d do it. In times like they are and the society we live in, not all parents would be/are as accepting. \n\nMaybe you overreacted a bit. I totally understand your hurt. Truly get how that can feel like a slap in the face. No matter how good you were or how good the stepdad is, for you as the bio dad, it can make you feel less official. \n\nDon\u2019t abandon your son because of all this.

You claim to love your son and maybe you do but you certainly don\u2019t respect him or his feelings. \nThos man has been in his life for most of his life, has probably spent more time with your son than you have and had absolutely been a father figure in his life. You saying \u2018just a stepfather\u2019 about this important man in your sons life is absolutely appalling. \nAnd most importantly he is not cutting you out, he just wants both the important men in his life to walk him down the aisle. \nStop being childish.", "I empathize, but this is petty.

This is kind of r/BeggingChoosers scenario.", "NAH - It was kind and generous of you to offer to pay but you are making it awkward. It is not the kid\u2019s fault his parents divorced, and who can fault him for having a good relationship with both his father and stepfather? He just wants to honor you both on his special day. I hope you all end up having a really nice wedding despite this little drama.", "NTA. You are his father. You raised with the time you had together. You are paying for the wedding.

Nothing in this world could replace my dad but my stepdad was a good man who also deserves recognition for helping to raise me and do right by me as a parent. \n\nI think it's time to realize you can't be all things to any one person. Growing up, kids learn from all kinds of people, their parents, their extended family, their teachers, and on and on. That's what \"it takes a village\" means. I'm sure your son loves you and recognizes you for everything that you are, but he's acknowledging this other man who loves his mom and has also been a good parent to him. This wedding is important to your boy and it's a good time to learn more about him than you knew before. Foot the bill and play nice", "I'm gonna say NTA.........BUT........you need to step back and really evaluate whether or not this needs to be an issue. Having step-dad walk down the isle also doesn't mean less for you, it just means more for your son and you should want your son to have all the happiness he deserves.", "NTA at all.  If you're his real dad and you're paying for the wedding you get the honour of this role.", "Why exactly should he have to share something like this? That\u2019s bullshit.

No\n\nDoes that mean he should have to share what is a traditional father role? Nope. \n\n\nPlenty of ways to recognize his stepdad without taking away from his actual dad", "NTA. You are his father, you have the rights to walk him down the aisle, if he wants so much to have his stepdad too, then he have to share the bill for the wedding.", "NTA", "YTA\nThe time spent walking down the isle is so minuscule compared to the years you and his stepdad /both/ spent raising him. Him not being blood related doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that he is also his father and obviously was a decent one if your son wants the both of you to do it. You said it yourself \u201cI\u2019d do anything for my boy\u201d so if this is what he really wants then I think you\u2019ll find a way to accept it.

I understand why you\u2019re hurt. You\u2019re thinking that if Steven is an equal father figure, why are you the only one footing the bill for this wedding. That argument would hold weight if Steve and your ex had the money and refused to give it but that\u2019s but the case here. They don\u2019t have the money. \n\nLook at it this way: a lot of couples these days pay for their own weddings, but many of those couples still have their parents walk them aisle even though they didn\u2019t pay for wedding. Paying for the wedding and walking the bride or groom down the aisle are completely unrelated to each other. If you really would do anything for your son, you should be willing to walk him down the aisle with his stepdad.", "YTA and you don't seem to know what being a father means.", "Look. YTA. My parents divorced when I was about 10. Both remarried within a few years. I just got married, and I wanted both of my dads to walk me down the aisle. I was scared if broaching this topic with my dad because I thought he would react exactly like you did. Instead, he was a reasonable human being and before I could talk to him about it he asked if both of them were walking me down. He was perfectly fine with my answer and just wanted to be supportive of me. My dad and stepdad got along just fine. It\u2019s a thirty second walk dude. Let your son be happy on his day.

Like it or not. This man played a significant role in your sons life. A parental figure. You\u2019re just being small minded and selfish. Your son isn\u2019t saying you aren\u2019t important. He\u2019s saying he wants to honor both men who helped raise him to be the man he is today. Put your pride aside. Do this for your son.", "YTA\n\nSteven also acted as a dad to Karter.

That was a decision you made and you shouldn\u2019t punish your son for being supported by someone else during your absence", "YTA. You adults were the ones who put this kid in the position of having two dads. Oh, it hurt a lot that he wanted both of you to walk him down the aisle for twenty seconds?

Now you're going to punish him *again,* on what should be the happiest time of his life, when he's  trying to make the best of *your* choice? \n\nWTF with you parents? You think you can just throw a grenade into a kids life then cry when you have the most minor of inconveniences because of your own choices? You're in the military?

The day isn't about you, but you're making it about you.", "I know so many women who chose their stepfathers over their birth fathers who just sat in the front row.

Good luck. You'll need a real heart to heart ASAP.", "So, you'll do anything for your boy except respect his wishes and give him the wedding he wants how he wants it? Got it.\n\nYeah. YTA. Nice job tanking your relationship with your child due to your ego.", "YTA. This is about your son, not you.", "Yes. YTA. This is going to strain your relationship with your child. His relationship with his stepdad does not diminish your relationship. Don\u2019t be petty. Apologize. And don\u2019t hold the fact you are paying for it over his head. Gifts should not come with strings.", "You keep going back to the point that your his \"real dad\". No, no you're not. You ARE his biological father, yes, but that doesn't equate to being a real dad. I can't making any judgement on either your or his step fathers parenting or the roles you played in his life.\nBut I can say that his stepfather clearly played an important enough part in his that he wants him to walk him down the isle, but he also wants you there too, meaning that you've also played an important part in his life.\nThis isn't a competition on who is the better father, or who he loves more. It's about him having both of his fathers there for him in a really important day of his life.\nFor you to put a price tag and stipulations on your love and support is just mean.

If he values his step dad so much then he can/should pay for the wedding. If I am being honest. I wouldn\u2019t even go to the wedding at all.

Your support for your son should come before your personal preferences.  If your support, love, or time is dependent on getting your way then yes, YTA.", "YTA. You just forced your son into an uncomfortable position with his wedding plans. This is not about you. You are making this all about yourself when the wedding is for your son.

Sounds like Steven is as much of a father figure to your kid as you are. Are you only paying for this wedding to prove your the 'real' father, or because you love your kid?

You\u2019re letting your ego turn this into being all about you. Your son, regardless of how you view it, sees himself as having two father figures- you, his biological one, and his stepdad.

Me and his mom were divorced by then but , I always made every effort to be a good dad and  spend time with him while on leave.  When i left  the Army ive spent every moment i could with my boy. We still have a good relationship. Now my ex remarried pretty quick to a nice guy \"Steven\" which of course he did treat Karter well and I'm not knocking that even though we don't get along  but,  I'm his actual dad.\n\nKarter's getting married to his fiance \"Clark\"  25M at the end of next month. My ex and Steven are a kinda strapped for cash and Clark's family isn't exactly wealthy so they asked me if I'd foot the bill. I agreed cause of course I'd do anything for my boy. Come to find out yesterday that  Karter wants both me and Steven to walk him down the aisle. That honestly really pissed me off you know cause I'm Karter's actual dad and I'm paying for everything and I've always been there for him. It hurt alot that he'd want some step parent to walk him down the aisle. We got into a huge fight about this morning  and I told him that I wouldn't pay for the wedding if Steven walks him down the aisle. My ex is pissed and thanks I'm being selfish but , my dad thinks I should push harder. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s wonderful that your son grew up with two men in his life that he thinks enough of to ask to participate in his special day. I\u2019ll bet that any child that your son has will want both of his/her/their dads (your son and his fianc\u00e9) to walk them down the aisle at their wedding; not just the one that they are biologically related to.", "Think about it this way: \n\nYou weren\u2019t the only father figure in your sons life after the divorce. You weren\u2019t able to be their all the time, which isn\u2019t inherently bad. But this other guy was able to step in and also be a positive influence on your sons life, he cared for him, and he loved him just like you do. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to pay for the wedding unless your son chooses only one of his dads to be in the ceremony, that\u2019s your choice, but don\u2019t be surprised if he picks the one not giving him ultimatums. Also remember that if this does damage to your relationship with your son, that was your choice", "Doesn\u2019t the mother walk the groom down the aisle?", "I\u2019d rather my stepdad walk me down the isle than my actual dad. My stepdad has done way more for me than my dad ever has. My dad thinks otherwise\u2026. Because apparently someone that\u2019s there 24/7 couldn\u2019t possibly do more than the bio parent *sarcasm* (BTW my dad was always gone for work too)\n\nIt\u2019s not up to you to decide that you mean more to your son just because your his bio parent.", "I thought about how I would feel if this were me. I would also be hurt and angry. I do understand how you feel but what\u2019s going to happen now that your not paying for the wedding? If your son does what you want and cuts off stepdad you know he will be angry with you. Is this what you want? You have a lot of thinking to do and decisions to make.", "You\u2019re being petty and jealous. Latter can love you AND Steven. Meanwhile, this is a sure fire way to push him away because you can\u2019t try to buy someone\u2019s love, and when you do it always backfires. YTA.", "Dont pay for the wedding dude. If your son want his stepdad to walk him down the aisle so much, then he should also pay for the wedding, they\u2019re wanting you to pay for all the wedding lol.", "YTA. SoMe sTePpArEnT my ass man. My kids have a wonderful step mom and if moms walked down the aisle I\u2019d gladly walk my kids with her. You feel insecure because you weren\u2019t present.", "Yta \n\nThis is not about you or your dad credentials - it is about your son who has two dads. One biological and one bonus. \n\nIf I were you I would be happy that my son had a step parent whom obviously loved and cared for him like a parent should. So many kids do not have that experience. \n\nYou aren\u2019t paying to play here - you are paying because he is your son and you want to see him happy and married to his person.", "I was gonna say YTA, but then you stated neither you nor step dad can afford. \n\nIf step dad chips in, would you still be mad?", "Can you offer to pay half? The rest can be picked up by his mom and step dad? Or loan them the money since they are \"strapped for cash\"?\n\nI think they are being just as difficult - they want you to foot the whole bill.", "YTA. Like it or not, Steven has been a major part of your son's life. His wedding isn't about you, and isn't the place for ultimatums. The whole \"pick me, and only me, or I won't help you\" attitude is not a good look, nor is it fair to your son.", "You might be paying, but YTA if you push this.\n\nYour son is lucky to have a stepfather in his life that is caring enough to make that kind of positive impact. Your son is marrying his fianc\u00e9, and creating a new family that will include both you AND Steven. There\u2019s no getting away from that. \n\nAsk for a father-son dance for just the two of you if you feel like you need a special moment in the sun.", "YTA. This is incredibly childish and selfish. It was mature and reasonable for Karter to want to include both of you. The wedding and the ceremony are about the couple getting married. You have now made it all about your ego. It seems like you resent another man stepping up and being an active participant in raising your son, when you should appreciate him. Do you have any idea how many kids are mistreated or even abused and neglected by step parents? The fact that he treated your son as his own has nothing to do with you personally, and you are not less of a father by him being present. So instead of helping your son have a happy wedding, you made it all about your feelings and to add insult to injury, you have now created a rift in your relationship with him that may never be fully repaired. I also think that you rescinding your offer to pay for the wedding if you don\u2019t get your way means you only agreed because you wanted the \u201ccredit\u201d and to have at least some control. The best advice I can give is to ask your son for his forgiveness, as well as his stepdad. Admit that you allowed ego and pride, to cloud your judgement and that you were being selfish. Because a simple apology is not enough. This should be the happiest and most exciting time in your son\u2019s life and you took away a piece of his joy by doing this.", "NTA. I would still pay and then not go the wedding, just to make your son ask himself if it the money was worth burning the relationship with his dad. I am very petty, and would not do this to my father, let alone if he was paying the wedding. The dude paying for the event should get preference over the one doing nothing.", "In our life if we are lucky to have children they are only \"ours\" for a short while. The fact that your son loves both you and his step dad says he's been extremely lucky. As a parent the more people who love our kids the better for them and us. \n\nI understand the initial hurt, but you should be proud that your son loves both you and step dad so much that he wants you both to walk him down the aisle. In a straight wedding you wouldn't be part of the service at all...\n\nIf you decide to stick to your guns you will be the AH but I don't think that's the way you'll go. Racing out on here says that you don't want to be.\n\nCongratulations on raising an amazing man with his mum and step dad.", "YTA and you are selfish. He loves both of you. You are both important. It's not about you. It's about your kid.", "YTA. But you don\u2019t have to be. I don\u2019t think your son is trying to belittle your relationship but instead honor both fathers that he has had in his life. As someone who had a dad and stepdad, I appreciate all that both have done to be a dad in my life. Rather than feel like you are being slighted, try to understand where your son is coming from. He\u2019s in a position that is difficult and is trying to navigate a situation where he don\u2019t want to hurt anyone involved.", "ESH  men dont wall dow  the isle wtf is this about", "He clearly can\u2019t rely on Steven in this, or he\u2019d be footing at least some part of the bill.", "Your nickel.

I can totally imagine your son wanting him there. Having both of you walk him down the aisle is an accurate depiction of your sons life. Why is that so hard to swallow?

YWBTA if you didn\u2019t man up and walk your son down the aisle with Steve.  Oh and your dad? Could it be he is pushing you because there\u2019s only men in this wedding equation?

You should be *thrilled* that your child has so many people in his life who love and support him.", "YTA, who do you think was there raising your son when you weren\u2019t? It was his mom and his step dad. You don\u2019t have to like it but his step dad is in fact a father figure in his life.", "NAH\n\nI absolutely understand you. But at the same time think that your son lived with his step dad for a long time and was also raised by him. It doesn't change the fact that you are his biological dad but he is still a major part of his family. And what will it bring you if they give in and you are the only one walking him down the aisle but they will always resent you for it? Not the hill to die on imo. I would see it differently if he would have chosen only the step dad. This way he is just trying to include everyone.", "I get why you are hurt, you want to be the special one, and you feel like by sharing with Steven it makes you less special.

For supposedly empathetic 2nd Father Figure & Mother for not talking to his stepson about the optics and basically wanting to have their cake and eat it, too.", "Lol if my bio dad didn\u2019t let my \u201cstep\u201d dad walk me down the aisle, point blank, he wouldn\u2019t be invited", "YTA", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal but NTA.", "YTA.

That's putting your feelings above your child's feelings, on a day that's not even about you. \ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26 I know I wouldn't do that but that's just me.", "Why is it OP\u2019s responsibility to fund his son wedding when no one else will but they want the glory. Let his stepdad love Kartar as much as he wants but OP does not have to pay for it!!!!! This is utter nonsense. \n\nThere are consequences for our actions and if Kartar wants his stepdad to walk him down the aisle so be it. I do think OP should attend the wedding. However, bio dad has every right not to pay for the wedding. Kartar should wait to get married until \u201che\u201d can pay for it. If he can\u2019t pay then he can\u2019t play!!!", "My child is doing wonderful thank you very much! I will admit that I was wrong and OP should attend this son\u2019s wedding but I have a major problem with Steven originally approaching OP to pay for the wedding when he himself could not afford to do so. Now he is calling OP out because he won\u2019t pay! Kartar needs to wait until he can foot his own expenses!", "He already agreed to foot the bill and only changed his mind due to his tantrum. My comment stands.", "OP has every right to not pay for a wedding. But I think not paying because of this specific reason alone is petty.", "I mean paying for the wedding isn\u2019t the thing OP has issue with here. It\u2019s just the factor he\u2019s using to leverage his petty jealousy. He said he was happy to step up and foot the bill because he could afford it and the others couldn\u2019t, right up until he found out Steven was walking down the isle with him. So it\u2019s clearly not about the money, it\u2019s about Steven. \n\nWalking down the isle is not something only reserved for those who paid for the wedding lol. It\u2019s whomever the bride/groom wants to walk them down the isle.", "op was fine paying until he realized he wasn't gonna his ass kissed. he's the one who is letting his ego get in the way of his relationship with his son", "OP said already they can\u2019t pay for the wedding and OP had no issue paying until he found this out. Don\u2019t give money with strings if you aren\u2019t disclosing that to begin with.", "\"Look, I will lay down my life for this kid, walk through fire, jump into a vat of lemon juice after 1000 paper cuts, but another man walking on his other side? Unreasonable.", "Fourthed", "Fourthed", "High cost can cause a major issue but the cost isn\u2019t my point. How many times have you and I read wedding entitlement horror stories? I don\u2019t know about you but it\u2019s been too many for me. Steven was the one who approached OP to pay for this shindig because he doesn\u2019t have the money. Well, he doesn\u2019t have the right to call OP out for refusing to do what he can\u2019t. Kartar needs to foot his own bills. Thanks for being willing to see another side to this!", "He should walk Kartar down the aisle but Steven requested OP for the wedding because he couldn\u2019t afford it. Why does Steven\u2019s ass deserve kissing? Kartar can wait to get married when he can pay his own expenses.", "I will admit I was wrong and OP should attend the wedding but believe Steven should shut up and Kartar needs to pay for his own wedding or wait until he can.", "You explained why it\u2019s an issue lol. Money come with strings. The only reason they want OP yo walk him down the aisle is because he\u2019s paying. I\u2019d be was t paying, OP would be left out", "But no-one is forcing him to pay it tho? He indeed has the choice of not paying and he can demand that HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO WALKS KARTER!!! But the choice he has here is wether to be an asshole, or not. And making these demands is an AH move. Wanting both the dad and the stepdad walk him down the aisle is not taking anything away from OP and OP using money as a leverage will do no favours for his relationship with his son. You know, the one he will to everything for...", "the only person op has said is calling him out is his ex.", "So does mine. Have a great night. Great reading your viewpoint.", "He may be petty but that is his right. Kartar can pay his own expenses. Steven specifically asked OP to pay for the wedding because he couldn\u2019t. Since Steven can\u2019t afford to pay he also doesn\u2019t get a say!!!", "He can walk him down the aisle but Kartar needs to pay for his own expenses.", "So what! I agree with you that he should walk Kartar down the aisle but Steven was the one requesting that  OP pay for the wedding because he couldn\u2019t afford to. Steven had to no right to expect this from OP! Kartar can wait to get married until he can pay for it!", "That's why they need a heart-to-heart conversation. He is asking us when the person he needs to be talking to is his child. Also, I don't agree with the last part because the son didn't disclose that he wanted his stepdad until after the fact OP agreed to pay for the wedding, which shows that he knew how his father would react.", "Fifthed.", "I interpreted it as his son and fianc\u00e9 asked him to pay not the ex and stepdad. I will say, if it was the ex and stepdad, that had to be emasculating to admit and ask. \n\nI was definitely having some bias and assuming the groom and groom weren\u2019t being entitled.  Personally I would like to know what the financial contribution is. \n\nNo matter what, they need to work this out. This could be a life changing moment.", "You keep saying that but no where in the post does it suggest Steven asked OP to pay for the wedding. Karter and Clark did. And yes, they probably should wait until they can pay for their own wedding because OP is clearly going to hold this over their heads and make demands in exchange, including demands like excluding a father figure who didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Wouldn\u2019t be worth it to me.", "it might come as a shock to you, but most parents help their kids with their weddings because they love their kids. what a concept.", "I agree he be there for the wedding but he shouldn\u2019t pay.", "Of course. But if you choose to be petty on the most important day of your child\u2019s life then there\u2019s going to be lasting impact. Just because something is within your rights, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nEdit: because you added a few lines to your comment after I responded. As a parent there will be a lot of situations where you have more money than your child does. Even when they are young adults. You have no obligation to share it with them. But if you choose to, you do it lovingly. Offering to help them financially but telling them they have no say in anything because you hold the purse strings is just a really crappy way to interact with your child.", "At this point since he's putting his pride over his son's feelings, looks like when Kartar can afford it dad probably won't be participating in the wedding party anymore. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "Yeah buddy, I'm sure he's saying 100% the truth and was paying the whole thing by himself, they were planning a wedding with 0 money on the expectative that \"dad will pay\"... you dumb bro, obviously that's HIS story.", "\n\n>Steven had to no right to expect this from OP!\n\nexpect what? for his father to not be asshole and not to make his wedding about him? you are freaking ridiculous. it's not an insult to ask that he be walked by both people he sees a father figure.", "Why would he assume that he needed to tell his father that? Wouldn't he just assume that his father supports him enough to respect his reasonable wedding wishes?", "Why would he need to disclose that? Sounds like he\u2019s already dealing with a toxic, jealous father who puts his own wants before his child\u2019s.", "Sixthed", "Thank you. I agree that they need to work it out but I am so tired of reading about wedding horror stories about entitled people who are willing to trample over others feelings to get what they want.", "Look at paragraph two of OP\u2019s original post. It clearly states that his ex wife and Sten asked him to pay.", "But why tho? Like, actually why is it disrespectful that Karter has two men in his life that he considers important enough to walk him? I'd get this reaction if he didn't want OP at all, but he does want him.", "I can see your point but I have a major problem with the wonderful Steven wanting OP to foot the bill for something he can\u2019t afford to do himself. My parents wanted to pay for my wedding but I said no. Kartar should wait to get married until he can pay for it himself and Steven needs to keep his mouth shut.", "I agree he should walk Kartar down the aisle but everyone is lauding how wonderful Steven is when he was the one who initially asked OP to pay for the wedding because he couldn\u2019t afford it. Now Steven is calling out OP for the very thing he is guilty of. Kartar need to pay his own expenses and Steven needs to shut up!", "I mean if I was OP I would pay up and then not show up at the party to make a point. I hope the money was worth burning his relationship with his father.", "I said that I was wrong and OP should walk Kartar down the aisle but under no circumstances should OP be mandated by his ex and the wonderful Steven to pay for something they clearly afford to do. As for me being ridiculous I have been respectful to you in my point of view but I will not under any circumstances stoop to name calling. Have a good evening.", "I mean after OP agreed he paying for the wedding  the son just magically told him that stepdad is also walking is suspicious.", "Read what you typed. Now tell me if this is true why would he want OP in the wedding to begin with?", "Because the usual expectation would be that he be the one walking down his son. If the son knew this was gonna be a source of tension in their relationship, he needed to tell his father about it before getting the money, which NGL shows greed.", "Yep. Check out paragraph two.", "I will admit that I was wrong and OP should walk his son down the aisle but here is my problem. Steven was the one who initially approached OP to pay for the wedding because he couldn\u2019t afford to do so. Now he\u2019s is calling out OP because he is doing the very same thing as Steven by not paying!!!!! I came from humble beginnings and was taught to work hard for what I wanted and wait until I could afford something. My parents wanted to pay for my wedding but I refused. Kartar needs to man up and wait to get married when \u201che\u201d can afford it! However, OP shouldn\u2019t have to be made the villain because this \u201cwonderful \u201c stepdad wants him to foot the bill!", "When OP says \u201cthey\u201d asked him to pay the bill I read that as Kartar and Clarke asked him not Steven. Every family is different. Just because you didn\u2019t take payment from your family doesn\u2019t mean that Kartar can\u2019t. OP agreed without a problem before he knew that Steven would also be walking. Whether OP should have been asked to pay the bill in the first place is irrelevant because it\u2019s not the question here. OP had no problem with that. The question is if OP should take back his offer solely due to having to share the moment with Steven.", "Look at paragraph two. OP stated that his ex wife and Steven are strapped for cash and asked OP to pay for the wedding.", "I see it. That sentence (edit: those 2 sentences) mentions Kartar, Clarke, Steven, EX and future in laws. It does not imply to me that Steven is the one who asked. To me it\u2019s saying Karter and Clarke are getting married. Option 1 and 2 cannot afford it. So they asked me."]}
