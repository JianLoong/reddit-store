It means we learn how to live with them because they are important to someone who is important to us. If you care about your husband his opinion should matter to you. And not just because he says to say the word sorry and suck it up but to be the bigger person because ultimately your husband is the one who is gonna suffer between the two of you.

I shouldn't have let that affect the things I say to you and I am sorry about that. But I do think it's best moving forward if anything I bring in the future is not commented on positive or negative.\" You can even add in that you care about her BECAUSE you care about your husband and most moms will really appreciate this. It doesn't have to be omg I love you now or fake shit. Just the facts that what you care about is your husband.
