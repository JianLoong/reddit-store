(I am not a chef and have zero clue what is in season/works even when it has been frozen or canned, but there is no way I'd bring a pumpkin pie on demand to have somebody then complain about it anyway - it'd just happen next year too so that would be a gigantic waste of effort)", "Same here.", "Came to say exactly the same. \n\nThen he can see if he thinks it's nice getting what you make, then apart by picky Mother dear. \n\nAnd just to top it off.

That's why it would be so hilarious to have Anthony make the pie.", "I see I see. So it seems like desserts are the common place of issue. I think it seems like MIL needs to be more open minded that everyone has different food tastes/preferences and that if you can\u2019t say something nice to not say it at all.\n\n\nI think if you do bring something like a store bought pumpkin pie and she makes a rude comment, to just say something neutral like \u201cthat\u2019s an interesting thing for you to say.\u201d and just leave it.\n\n\nShe might just be wanting a reaction out of you.\n\n\nI am wondering if this is a bigger issue outside of the thanksgiving food.
