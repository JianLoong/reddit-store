While two generally sit I do make sure to have wheel time on all 3 functional ones during the week. I'm leaving town in a few days and a relative I barely even talk to asked if I could loan a spare car to her 19 year old daughter because she wasn't paying attention and ran her car into a truck. My mom let it slip I owned a lot of \"beater\" cars and won't be driving them because I'm going to be out of town. \n\n\n\nMy cars aren't special or beaters but some do fall on the rare side (70s Lincoln, 240 Volvo turbo(non op), 80s Buick wagon and late model focus) she was specifically asking to borrow my focus but changed her mind when I told her it's stick shift. She asked about the Buick(the Lincoln was automatically out it's 20 feet long)  I said no because I just recently acquired it and I don't want anyone else driving it. She said she understood and hung up. \n\n\n\nHour or so later my mom calls me upset telling me it's really selfish to not let family borrow a car when they really need it, my relative apparently told her that I didn't want a teenager fucking my cars up. I explained to my mom that my cars are special to me and I took a lot of time to find them and who was going to be on the hook if anything happened to them. She said she would cover the cost of the Buick wagon if anything happened because she thought I only spent 500$, when I gave her the real price she seriously thought I got robbed(mint 85 estates aren't cheap). After about a hour her trying to negotiate I flat out said no to loaning her any car she said something along the lines that I wouldn't know if one was borrowed while I was gone. My dad is 100% in support of my decision to not loan cars to people who wrecked theirs. \n\n\nI pretty much had to call some friends to get my cars parked at different places while I'm out of town.

Absolutely not. Just because you're not driving it in the moment doesn't mean it's free game to just loan out to people, especially to a teenager that proved she can't really be trusted driving safely. It doesn't matter if your mom would pay for any damages. The value of a possession ike that doesn't always equal money.", "As if you'd ever get a single cent out of her if the car got wrecked. There would be a million reasons she didn't have to pay you. NTA", "NTA. So to put it simply, she wrecked her own car, didn't think about the consequences, and now thinks she's entitled to drive *your* car (completely factoring out that these are rare cars)? How selfish of her!", "NTA. You are under no obligation to loan your cars to anyone, particularly people you don't actually know anything about except that they are careless drivers.", "Nta. Don't do it. Them kids can get their own car, own insurance, own gas...", "NTA. Why take the risk, especially when she wrecked her own car.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if you paid $1 for those cars. The kid wrecked her car, don\u2019t give her a chance to do the same to yours. If your family has a problem with it, tell them to loan their car out", "NTA, those are your cars. The kid wasn't paying attention and crashed her own car. What part of that would make anyone want to loan her a car? This is what is called consequences. Stand your ground, don't give into guilt. Good job on getting those cars to friends homes to make sure they aren't taken behind your back.", "NTA.\n\nYou are never under any obligation to lend someone the use of your property. Your stuff, you get to decide when and how it gets used.\n\nThat's especially true with things that are important and/or expensive. Personally, I would *never* allow anyone other than my wife or myself to drive my car(s). Just... don't even ask, the answer is no. Doesn't matter if I'm using it or not. I would sooner give someone a ride round-trip than allow anyone else to drive my cars.", "NTA- I mean she wrecked her own car so I don't think she would pay more attention to someone else's.

They are yours , you brought them , you look after them \n\nAlso why the fuck would you lend her a car when she has shown she doesn't concentrate and wrecks cars. \n\nI would make sure there are no spare keys where your family could find them and I'm sure your friends already know not to give them\n\nAlso fair play to dad for siding with you. Mum's is siding with a liar, basically saying she will steal it and wanting to give your car to someone who can't concentrate on the road.\n\nYour money, your cars.

I wouldn't loan that little 19 yr old dummy one of my cars? She wrecked it because she wasn't paying attention! Like how do you not see a large truck in front of you? Lord give me strength.

As a previous young person who f***** up several cars dont lend them. Young people are sh*t drivers", "The girl in question just trashed a car coz of driving while distracted.

Also lol to people being upset that you don't want to give your cars to people only needing it becuase they crashed their old one by being neglectful. It could've been the most beat up shit car ever and you'd still not be TA for refusing to lend it to anyone, be it your niece or the president.", "Your mother threatened to steal your car. \n\nI don't have anything to say here.
