Welp. One honeymoon night and a few weeks later I got the double line for the first time ever on the pee-stick. Soo yeah.\n\nThis is when our argument really began, although it has already kind of been in the back of our minds as a potential issue once we did decide to start trying - his mom (my MIL) is what I consider to be a HEAVY smoker. She no longer smokes when I come over because she knows I am asthmatic and somewhat allergic to smoke, but her house is still literally INFUSED with smoke and the nicotine smell. I actually make sure to not wash my hair whenever I know I'm going to her house ahead of time so that I can wash it as soon as I get home, because it's so bad that my hair and clothes retain the smell and then it makes me sneezy, eye watery and sniffly going to bed, which I can't stand. I have also made it clear to husband whenever I go to her house for more than a couple of hours that it has become a sacrifice of my health that I'm making every time, because I start coughing really bad after a few hours there, and the next day in the morning I feel as though I've smoked a whole pack of cigarettes myself (in other words my lungs hurt, my nose is stuffed, and I feel like complete shit for a whole day after).\n\nHaving said that, I truly do love my MIL, we get along really well most of the time and she is so sweet and caring- I always say I lucked out in the MIL department.\n\nI know quitting smoking is insanely difficult, but at some point don't you have to stop to think about how everyone around you is getting impacted by it? ALSO she is always more than welcome to come over our house but she apparently refuses to drive on the freeway and a 30 minute drive is too long for her... she is 62 years old. I personally find that ludicrous considering my parents are in their mid-60's and commuting over 2 hours a day on the fwy every day to work still. It just seems like it's her way or the highway on this, but I don't want my baby inhaling smoke and that's that. I don't know...

Ur husband needs to realize for the health of the child sometimes something like this needs to be sacrificed.", "NTA, second hand smoke is especially dangerous for babies and bad for you too. And since you\u2019re allergic it\u2019s quite possible the baby could inherit those allergies, but even if they don\u2019t it\u2019s not healthy to be around so much smoke and it\u2019s MIL\u2019s choice is she doesn\u2019t want to visit or meet you somewhere because you\u2019re being rational and 30 minutes isn\u2019t far", "NTA.

She wants to she you and family she either drives or her son sacrifices his time to drive to and from her house. \n\nYour health and baby\u2019s health is a hill to die on.", "NTA you're doing what you have to to protect your baby. If this is your reaction to what the house smells like, imagine how your newborn will react. Worse than you I assure you. If your MIL wants to meet up with the child, and when it isn't a newborn baby, maybe you guys can meet halfway if she doesn't want to drive all the way to your house so she can spend time with her grandchild and so you don't have to go to her house. Win win", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s going to be difficult to have the talk but the sooner you do, the better. She can work on quitting or get used to the drive. Maybe the baby will be motivation enough for her to quit. \n\nSmoke hangs around indoors for hours. The baby would be getting second hand smoke even if she is not smoking while you are there. Even with air purifiers, open windows, open doors and airflow. There is just no safe way for that baby to be in her house. \n\nThere is tons of research and data about indoor smoke and exposure.

If MIL wants to see LO, you guys can meet in a public place, a park or for lunch. \n\nAs for MIL quitting smoking, yes stopping an addiction is difficult.

Great MIL but she\u2019s a chain smoker. Luckily, she doesn\u2019t come around often. Husband and I fought once because she was around when one of my kids was a baby baby and she would come in from outside smelling like an ashtray. I reminded him of third hand smoke and he thought I was crazy. \n\nLuckily MIL would wear this flannel shirt to smoke and would take it off. She would also wash her hands when holding the baby. But I worried about her breath. Ultimately, it became a non-issue because she comes like 3 times a year. Once the kids were older, it also became less of a problem since she wasn\u2019t holding them up to her smoke filled clothes and the kids kept their distance a bit. \n\nAsk your hubby if she can switch to a vape while visiting your house. I would also remind of third hand smoke and the dangers to kids. \n\nhttps://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/How-Parents-Can-Prevent-Exposure-Thirdhand-Smoke.aspx", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to bring your newborn anywhere you feel is not safe.  Period.   \n\nThe whole comparing her to your parents isn't really relevant.    Some people do not drive much and some do.   I'm 65 and I love to drive.  I'll drive from San Francisco to L.A. in six hours and come back a few days later.   I have a friend who never wants to go further than an hour from home.   \n\nBut with your MIL that means she won't be seeing her grandchild very often because of her nicotine addiction.    I couldn't stand my three pack a day brother to touch my kids hair.  He would pat them on their heads when greeting them on the few visits we had with him.   \nHis fingers made their hair smell putrid.     \n\nMaybe you can meet on neutral ground at a restaurant or park half way in between your places.", "NTA. Your kid your rules. She can figure out rides or transit or anything she wants, what she can't do is poison your baby. Your husband needs to have a long talk with your midwife - or pediatrician if you've got one already - about this, since he's not listening to you.", "NTA. My mom grew up in a household where everyone smoked in the house around her. She has copd now from it and she never smoked a day in her life. \nMy aunt\u2019s son passed away from SIDS because she\u2019s a chain smoker. She smoked outside on our patio when she stayed at our house for a week and my mom had asthma attacks from the third hand smoke smell she came inside the house with. Don\u2019t doubt you\u2019re reasoning here and definitely protect your baby.", "NTA you are putting your child\u2019s health at the forefront which is what every parent should do. If MIL wants to see baby she can come to your place or meet somewhere", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t want to bring a child into a smoke filled house. I really believe some smokers just get to a point where they can\u2019t smell it. My late husband would come home reeking of smoke and be surprised that I smelled it immediately.", "NTA. \n\n\nStale smoke lingers in upholstery, on walls and ceilings, clothes, hair, everywhere. It's toxic, regardless of whether or not you're asthmatic or allergic to it. And thus, not wanting to subject a child to this is a reasonable request.\n\n\nBut it sounds like you do want baby to visit grandma. I think you all need to sit down and talk about it. Maybe hire someone to professionally clean the smoke out of her house, and then ask her to smoke outside, or in one room with the door shut and windows open? Figure something out so it's not hazardous to yours and baby's health.", "NAH. I wouldn\u2019t expect her or hold out for her to quit smoking though. While it would be great for that to be outcome of her wanting to see grandbaby more, I wouldn\u2019t ask for it or bank on it. But I would hold the line that baby does not go to her house and isn\u2019t around her while she\u2019s smoking. It\u2019s a painful topic, but you have PLENTY of data to back up your concern and part of being a parent is making the decisions that are best for your kid, not what makes your husband or MIL most comfortable. I would start this convo with husband first though, and maybe include your GP or some data on secondhand smoke. Because if he\u2019s not in board with this decision it\u2019s going to be so much harder to communicate and enforce to MIL. NAH because it\u2019s smoking is a serious addiction for MIL that\u2019s not going to be easy to stop, and husband understandably wants his mother and kid to spend time together - but child\u2019s health has to come first.", "I forgot to add: Husband's older sister has two kids that she brings there all the time and lets them stay for days on end, and so I would be judging them too when bringing all this up. I tried to talk to husband about it before multiple times and I get the impression he must have said something to MIL because she doesn't invite me over that much anymore, but I'm not sure how much he stressed my health issues or if he ever even mentioned about the baby.", "The MIL from my first marriage was like this. I even was a casual smoker at the time but I could not stand to be in that house. It\u2019s one thing to have a smoke outside, trying to stay away from others who don\u2019t smoke. It\u2019s another to do it in a freaking house. It\u2019s disgusting and legitimately dangerous. It\u2019s going to be a very uncomfortable conversation but ultimately one you have to have. The baby will not be able to go to that house. Grandma may eventually change her mind about visiting you.", "NTA.  But.\n\nFigure out ways that the needs of everyone are met.  Drive grandma to and from your house.  Meet her at a park near her house.", "I think the time to have talked about that was long before now\u2026. Gma being a smoker isn\u2019t a surprise, right? I don\u2019t know how I would react with \u201cmy kids can\u2019t ever go to my moms house\u201d being sprung on me.

I will take husband with me to my next appointment since I'm due soon and we can discuss with the doc like some have suggested here - hoping he will see that it's a bigger deal than he thought.
