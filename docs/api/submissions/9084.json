She no longer smokes when I come over because she knows I am asthmatic and somewhat allergic to smoke, but her house is still literally INFUSED with smoke and the nicotine smell. I actually make sure to not wash my hair whenever I know I'm going to her house ahead of time so that I can wash it as soon as I get home, because it's so bad that my hair and clothes retain the smell and then it makes me sneezy, eye watery and sniffly going to bed, which I can't stand. I have also made it clear to husband whenever I go to her house for more than a couple of hours that it has become a sacrifice of my health that I'm making every time, because I start coughing really bad after a few hours there, and the next day in the morning I feel as though I've smoked a whole pack of cigarettes myself (in other words my lungs hurt, my nose is stuffed, and I feel like complete shit for a whole day after).\n\nHaving said that, I truly do love my MIL, we get along really well most of the time and she is so sweet and caring- I always say I lucked out in the MIL department.\n\nI know quitting smoking is insanely difficult, but at some point don't you have to stop to think about how everyone around you is getting impacted by it? ALSO she is always more than welcome to come over our house but she apparently refuses to drive on the freeway and a 30 minute drive is too long for her... she is 62 years old. I personally find that ludicrous considering my parents are in their mid-60's and commuting over 2 hours a day on the fwy every day to work still.

I reminded him of third hand smoke and he thought I was crazy. \n\nLuckily MIL would wear this flannel shirt to smoke and would take it off. She would also wash her hands when holding the baby. But I worried about her breath. Ultimately, it became a non-issue because she comes like 3 times a year. Once the kids were older, it also became less of a problem since she wasn\u2019t holding them up to her smoke filled clothes and the kids kept their distance a bit. \n\nAsk your hubby if she can switch to a vape while visiting your house.

I'll drive from San Francisco to L.A. in six hours and come back a few days later.   I have a friend who never wants to go further than an hour from home.   \n\nBut with your MIL that means she won't be seeing her grandchild very often because of her nicotine addiction.    I couldn't stand my three pack a day brother to touch my kids hair.

It's toxic, regardless of whether or not you're asthmatic or allergic to it. And thus, not wanting to subject a child to this is a reasonable request.\n\n\nBut it sounds like you do want baby to visit grandma. I think you all need to sit down and talk about it.

But I would hold the line that baby does not go to her house and isn\u2019t around her while she\u2019s smoking. It\u2019s a painful topic, but you have PLENTY of data to back up your concern and part of being a parent is making the decisions that are best for your kid, not what makes your husband or MIL most comfortable. I would start this convo with husband first though, and maybe include your GP or some data on secondhand smoke. Because if he\u2019s not in board with this decision it\u2019s going to be so much harder to communicate and enforce to MIL. NAH because it\u2019s smoking is a serious addiction for MIL that\u2019s not going to be easy to stop, and husband understandably wants his mother and kid to spend time together - but child\u2019s health has to come first.", "I forgot to add: Husband's older sister has two kids that she brings there all the time and lets them stay for days on end, and so I would be judging them too when bringing all this up.

I even was a casual smoker at the time but I could not stand to be in that house. It\u2019s one thing to have a smoke outside, trying to stay away from others who don\u2019t smoke. It\u2019s another to do it in a freaking house. It\u2019s disgusting and legitimately dangerous. It\u2019s going to be a very uncomfortable conversation but ultimately one you have to have.

Drive grandma to and from your house.  Meet her at a park near her house.", "I think the time to have talked about that was long before now\u2026. Gma being a smoker isn\u2019t a surprise, right?

A house she owned, when she had smoked inside for about 30 years, because the health of her grandbaby mattered more than her habits.\n\nNTA", "NTA - my parents started harassing me for grandkids, I told them I wouldn\u2019t have kids as long as they were still smoking as a way to shut them up. They both quit and have been smoke free nearly a year. \n\n\nMission failed successfully.", "NTA, I think you're in the right to be concerned about how something that has a visible negative effect on you will impact your baby.\n\nYour MIL needs to understand that this is something that can harm him. Even in the hypothetical that it won't, isn't worth much more to not even chance it? You want her grandson safe, especially at one of his most fragile states.\n\nAsk your husband if he notices how your MIL's secondhand smoke (even though she's no longer smoking!) does things to you, and ask him if he wants his baby there. You don't want to keep the baby away from grandma, you want to keep the baby out of an environment that has you feeling terrible as an adult, and you're worried it could harm him.\n\nNo one wants to know if the baby has the same sensitivity to secondhand smoke.\n\nHopefully you can be understood, and they'll work with you to find a solution you're comfy with.\n\nAgain, NTA. Good luck, OP.", "Also if you have this reaction to smoke, it could be that your kid might have a similar reaction. So at the very least, wait until the kid is older before bringing them over. But in general in the future, what about going over to grandma\u2019s place and then all of you go to a park or playground nearby?", "NTA but drop the negative judgement about her not driving on the freeway. Her age and the fact that your parents fo are irrelevant. If she doesn't feel competent to do that, be glad she keeps everyone safe by knowing her limits! As others have pointed out there are compromises. She can get a ride share to visit you. Her sin can bring her over until rhe child is old enough to meet in the park. Etc.", "NTA - and usually think parents are TOO protective of their infants.", "NTA", "NTA second hand smoke is so incredibly harmful. Protect your baby.", "Or your husband can go get grandma and bring her to your house, then take her home. Or call a cleaning crew to go through mil's house and clean it.", "NTA. Point this out to DH: kiddo might inherit your asthma and smoke allergy. You don't want kiddo getting sick on a weekly basis or them forming a negative view of grandma because they get sick everytime they visit.", "Not only are you totally right in not wanting baby around all the smoke, the fact that you're expected to bring the baby anywhere rather than her come to you is insane. That's not how it works. People visit the baby in the baby's home where they are most comfortable and around all their stuff. NTA.", "NTA- You are a parent, no one else\u2019s feelings matter. Your job is to raise a healthy and well adjusted adult.  Think of it this way. Remember Fred Flinstone\u2019s foot powered car? You are now driving the car. Anyone not actively moving their feet, (making sure your child is supported in both nature and nutrients), is dragging their feet which ultimately means they are working against you.  \n\nPlease note: I said well adjusted because some parents go way overboard with this advice and end  up turning their children into entitled ass hats.", "Meet her at some place which is closer to her home but will keep you away from the smoke.  Children\u2019s museum?  Zoo?  Problem is that she will want to hold the baby while her clothes and person are all smoke soaked.  You and hubs will need to figure out your plan with that in advance but keeping the baby in a stroller may be the way to go. \n\nMil does not realize how much she reeks of smoke because she is nose blind to the whole thing.", "NTA. I smoked when my first grandchild was born although I always smoked outside even at my own home. But my DIL made the rule that I had to be at their house, wear clothes that she had kept there for me and wash my hands as soon as I got to her house and each time before I held the baby. I did it without complaint because seeing the baby was more important to me than having my own way. also because smoking is terrible for your health and I couldn\u2019t logically object to her revulsion over it. I did end up quitting soon after my first grandchild was born and she was a factor in that decision.", "NTA. And I would die on this sword.", "If you go to r/sciencebasedparenting you should be able to find some good, scientific resources to discuss with your husband. Also your OB might be able to help you out with resources, or even speak to your husband directly about it during one of your checkups.", "Would your MIL consider/afford an Uber?  That might be a solution where she does not have to drive to see the baby. \n\nOh and congratulations!  You sound like you\u2019ll be a fantastic and thoughtful mom.", "NTA. How can anyone even live in a house like that, this is really disgusting to me. Her house is literally ruined, you basically cannot get that odor out of the building materials once it's there.\n\nHonestly though. If you read about second hand smoke, it includes not only airborne smoke, but also objects, clothes, hair, etc that are as you said \"infused\" with smoke. Even if she does come over to your house instead, shed better be showered and bring fresh clothes to wear which have not been infused with smoke if she wants to hold the baby. This is quite literally a SIDS risk factor (even the clothes/hair) and when you are a mom that definitely takes precedence over anyone else's feelings.", "NTA.  people who smoke indoors are gross.  she can at least learn to go outside to smoke, and have her house deep cleaned", "NTA.\n\nMy grandparents were chain smokers, their home was exactly as you described. Even my granddad's white poodle was nicotine yellow after living there long enough. My brothers had heavy asthma as babies and were sick for days whenever they went to my grandparents. \n\nMy mum told them they were welcome to visit our home but no cigarettes could be smoked during their visit, hey also added that we wouldn't be visiting their home until they stopped smoking. \n\nMy grandparents quit so that they could have family visit their home and thanked my mum in later years for giving them that push after the benefits of quitting began to show. If your in laws want to see their grandkids enough, they will quit too.", "Tell your husband no you're not keeping the baby from grandma. MIL is welcome to come to your  house. Ask him why is he not arguing with MIL for staying away from her grandbaby? Wouldn't it be easier for her to come to you anyway? Ask him does the baby's health not matter to him if MIL doesn't want to drive 30mins then someone can go get her. How are you the bad guy when she doesn't want to make the effort to come see the baby. Not even asking husband to come get her and drive her to visit or get someone else to drive her. Tell him you are not stopping MIL seeing her grandbaby. So therefore you're not keeping her from the baby. Grandma is STAYING AWAY does he not take issue with that tell him that since MIL doesn't like to drive tell him he could go get her and bring her or she could make arrangements to come to you. Ask him how many discussions has had with his mother about this ask him if he'd suggested/offered to drive her/get some to drive her to your house. Ask him why should baby go to a smoke filled house. Ask him how is it selfish for you to care about your child's health. Doesn't he think it's selfish of is mother to not even think about other options other than making you go to them. Keeping the baby from grandma would not be allowing grandma to see baby. Which is not what you're doing you don't want the baby to go to a smoke filled house. As you said MIL is welcome to come to you. She doesn't like driving on the freeway. Well she could get someone to drive her. That while the baby is a baby it would be a lot simpler if she came to you. NTA", "NTA. Newborns are so fragile & they need to be protected from literally everything. I had to stay in the hospital for a week because my 1 month old was coughing & he was diasgnosed with lung infection. Not fun at all. The doctors couldnt even give him any medicine except antibiotics because he was so young. Protecting your baby comes above everything else.", "If it makes a difference I had this ultimatum with my own mom. Her house was as you described but also her car. I told her she could visit us but I\u2019d never allow my kid to be in her vehicle or house. She did quit (my dad also) and their house was so bad they had to repaint because they couldn\u2019t stand the smell and also get their car detailed. I\u2019m kinda shocked your husband is cool with seeing your physical reaction and not worried what a newborns reaction would be.", "I saw a link posted somewhere on Reddit yesterday about third hand smoke & babies. Clicked on it & skim read. \n\nFirst I\u2019d really heard of it - but apparently the surfaces of a house with a long term smoker can be just as dangerous as second hand smoke to other people (so especially babies - just think of the crawling stage when they\u2019re touching everything & then putting hands in their mouth!). \n\nAs in - being in her \u201cvery smoked in\u201d house *even when she is not smoking* is JUST AS dangerous as if she was blowing puffs of smoke into your baby\u2019s face. \n\nGoogle it to find out the actual science / facts - but that\u2019s how I read the linked page yesterday.", "NTA but this could very possibly destroy your relationship with your husband and MIL and if it does destroy your relationship with your husband he could bring your kid to your MIL without you", "Your baby. Your rules.", "NTA that house is full of toxins. Don't take baby there. It is in the rugs, furniture, curtains, bedding. She can come to you", "NTA and get your pediatrician to back you up.", "NTA. If grandma really cared she can get an uber or have your husband pick her up.", "NTA. All the advice here about speaking to your OB next appointment your husband tags along to is perfect.  \n\nHas your MIL ever visited your home? I know she's opposed to it now,  but if she did in the past would you have a lesser reaction? If your reaction is doable, would your husband/MIL be open to your husband picking her up and bringing her to your house? It's extra driving and had for you, obviously, and you'll still encounter some second hand smoke since it'll be on her, but it'd be about the same if you met at a park or restaurant (minus lingering smells in your home after they leave). Just a thought.  Good luck OP!", "He might even say \u201cwell if our kid can\u2019t go to my mothers house then they can\u2019t go to your parents house\u201d and then you\u2019ll have another big fight"]}
