She has quite a strong bond with her family (which I totally respect) and a fair share of friends, while my folks are gone and I don't really have any remaining close friends either. We're both working at home so we do spend a lot of time together, however I'd argue that it's not really time spent together because we're each busy with our own programs and we don't really spend too much time doing things together during the day. Her program is quite a typical one, with full-time working during weekdays and free weekends, while my program is somehow lighter, but I don't have the weekends free, so basically the only time we have to actually spend time together would be during evenings.   \n\n\nNow my idea is that after a hard day of work, I'd really like to look spend the evenings together. Also, I'd really not feel comfortable knowing that she's out by herself after dark. So I told her that I totally understand if she wants to meet with her family, with her friends, or just have some personal time for herself outside the home, but I'd expect her to be back at home by 8:00 PM and if there's an event that takes place during evenings to only attend together.  \n\n\nWhile she agrees with the general idea, she does not agree with it as a rule and wants to \"keep her options open\".  \n\n\nAm I the asshole for insisting on having this as a rule?", "created_utc": 1683839779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13f0atg/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_at_home_by_2000_800_pm/", "score": 701, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I must get home to my husband. \"", "You Are A Complete Asshole. She's a grown ass woman and can come and go as she pleases. You can encourage her to be safe.

Because she\u2019s a human being .. the premise of your argument is not that \u201cshe\u2019s not safe\u201d but that she\u2019s not with you .. so it\u2019s about control not safety \u2026 the evidence to support that is in your words \u201cI\u2019d really like to spend the evening together\u201d\u2026 dude just agree to an evening, once or twice a week", "YTA just make some friends dude", "Your behavior is controlling. Control is a type of abuse. YTA.", "Ok, control issues.

A curfew that is suited to a child under 12. Um, no.

YTA. Seriously who do you think you are to order another adult to be at home by a certain hour. Don't get me wrong I totally support the general idea of having the nights together. But I would laugh in your face if you had the audacity to tell me to be at home at 8 as the rule of the house.", "YTA. Trying to impose an 8pm curfew on your wife is ridiculous and demeaning.", "YTA.\n\nKinda controlling. You can suggest the rule, but it's up to her if she wants to implement it. She is an adult.", "YTA. She has other people in her life to spend time with. From the sounds of it, she still makes you a priority, but it's normal for her to also want to spend time with other people, even later at night. You cannot give a grown woman a curfew. It's controlling. She's an adult and your wife, not your teenage daughter.", "There is zero doubt in this, YTA. Sometimes I can see the dilemma, but she is 100% correct. This is absurd. I think it is reasonable to be concerned about your wife\u2019s safety, but it is crazy controlling to set a curfew for your adult wife. Many women, with a modicum of self respect, would consider this his to be deal breaker level of controlling.", "You\u2019re not just an asshole you\u2019re a controlling asshole. You do not get to enforce a curfew on your wife. Hell my kids have a later curfew. I\u2019m actually sure that you\u2019re more absurd than she claims. YTA", "YTA. Not sure you know what the words \"totally respect\" mean.", "YTA - holy shit \ud83d\ude02\n\nYou have no right to try and impose a curfew on someone, it's beyond ridiculous.

And question why you feel comfortable demanding she come home like a child.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you giving your wife a curfew? Considering you met later in life it sounds like she was able to navigate this without you just fine.", "YTA. Expecting your equal partner to follow an imposed curfew is different from a request to spend more time together.", "YTA. \n\nHave you tried to make an effort to befriend other adults instead of trying to assign your partner a curfew? Because that\u2019s actually insane and abusive.", "YTA- you \u201cexpect her home by 8 pm\u201d- excuse me?! No. Absolutely not. \nPeople have lives and make plans, and as a couple you can discuss those plans on a case by case basis and express you opinions, but you do not get to impose a curfew on your spouse. She is her own person, she can make her own decisions. If you want to spend time with her, TALK to her and make plans. If you feel like you don\u2019t see her enough, talk to her and discuss a regular date night or a change in schedule. \n\nUnilaterally imposing a curfew is a guaranteed way to get her to resent that time with you. It undermines her independence, and suggests you don\u2019t trust her to manage her own time- so you\u2019re building resentment, trust issues, and belittling her maturity and decision making abilities all in one fell swoop. \n\nHeaven help the partner who dares treat me like an errant teen- you\u2019re her PARTNER not her parent.", "You get that she's your partner and not your teenage daughter, right?  YTA", "YTA, she's your wife, not your child.  She made it many years into adulthood without you, I'm sure she knows how to be safe.  If you need to control something that bad, get a plant. A fake one.", "Yta, my parents have been together almost 30 years, and my dad has never once demanded my mother be home to entertain him. Despite my mom only starting full-time work around a decade ago, and he works full time too. \n\nHe has never once placed a curfew on a grown woman and made her feel like a child for having relationships with people in her family outside of him.\nYou know what he does? Household chores, hobbies, talks to friends, plays video games etc. He also never demands she doesn't attend any plans without him, he supports and cheers her on with anything she does. And the same goes for my dad by my mom.

You aren\u2019t concerned with your wife\u2019s safety. You want to control her. And I bet isolating her from her friends and family is the cherry on top.", "YTA\n\n>I'd really not feel comfortable knowing that she's out by herself after dark.\n\nThis is completely unreasonable. As you said you met later in life - she is an adult who was completely capable of managing her own life before you were part of it.", "YTA. You understand that this is your wife and not your teenage daughter?!\n\nYou don't get to make rules about what or when she does anything.

That's your problem and she shouldn't have to sacrifice her relationships for your comfort. \n\nSure, she should *want* to spend time with you, but day in and day out is freaking ridiculous.

She has quite a strong bond with her family (which I totally respect) and a fair share of friends, while my folks are gone and I don't really have any remaining close friends either. We're both working at home so we do spend a lot of time together, however I'd argue that it's not really time spent together because we're each busy with our own programs and we don't really spend too much time doing things together during the day. Her program is quite a typical one, with full-time working during weekdays and free weekends, while my program is somehow lighter, but I don't have the weekends free, so basically the only time we have to actually spend time together would be during evenings.   \n\n\nNow my idea is that after a hard day of work, I'd really like to look spend the evenings together. Also, I'd really not feel comfortable knowing that she's out by herself after dark. So I told her that I totally understand if she wants to meet with her family, with her friends, or just have some personal time for herself outside the home, but I'd expect her to be back at home by 8:00 PM and if there's an event that takes place during evenings to only attend together.  \n\n\nWhile she agrees with the general idea, she does not agree with it as a rule and wants to \"keep her options open\".  \n\n\nAm I the asshole for insisting on having this as a rule?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So say arrive by 6pm latest. Clock strikes 7.15pm. \n\nWife: Sorry Friend, I have to go home, hubby has set a curfew for me. \n\nFriend: \u2026.. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t leave an awful lot of time to grab a coffee, much less grab dinner or similar. \n\nEven Cinderella had a later curfew.\n\nAnd the not out after dark argument: \n\nDon\u2019t know where you live, but the out after dark argument is BS.

If you're not willing to do that because you're too tired and would rather stay home, then don't force her to stay to entertain you, that's how you get someone to feel trapped and leave you.", "ETA. You, for failing to communicate the issue appropriately to your wife and instead attempting to treat her like a child. Her, for failing to value the feelings of the person she chose to marry and instead prioritizing only her own.\n\nIt doesn't seem as though the two of you are on the same page regarding what married life should be.", "This guy screams insecurity. He is not afraid she will get hurt. He is afraid she will meet someone better than him.", "No wonder she doesn't want to be around someone this suffocating, I'd be getting the hell out too", "Even when I WAS a child I didn't have this strict of a curfew. During the summers in elementary school I just had to be home when the streetlights came on which was around 9pm. And this was before cellphones. By the time I was 17 I didn't have a curfew at all. OP is absolutely absurd.", "But you don\u2019t understand, it\u2019s not safe for her to be out after dark by herself, I mean she is a *woman* for god\u2019s sake. He is doing this *for her*!", "As soon as I saw military time in the title, I knew YTA.", "I had a later curfew than this when I was 11 years old. Worried about her being out after dark? I mean damn guess she better ride her bike home when the street lights come on.", "Nor is it for him to decide that she needs to be protected, \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable knowing she\u2019s out by herself in the dark.\u201d", "Because OP has no friends or hobbies or anything going on at all, so obviously his wife can\u2019t either.", "Well, if he punishes her for being his wife, maybe she\u2019ll learn not to do that any more.", "I was sure he was going to say he\u2019d made repeated requests for her to be home by then, but it was so much worse\u2026", "I can see why he\u2019s on a new marriage\u2026", "There\u2019s a pretty big difference between:\n\n\u201cHey Hun, I miss you. When can we make a point to spend more time together? Can we do XYZ each week and stay in on DAY?\u201d \n\nand \n\n\u201cHey Hun, you go out too much. From now on I\u2019m going to need you to be home every night by 8 for 2-4 hours of mandatory quality time.\u201d \n\nThe first is a normal discussion between partners. The second is a ruling issued by someone who expects obedience. You see why NAH does not apply here, no matter his motivation for the decree?", "Well, that one depends on the teenager.", "Mine was 9:30/10 in high school and on Friday nights I could call them and say \u201cI\u2019m staying at X persons house tonight, see y\u2019all in the morning!\u201d", "I fully expected the wife to laugh in his face when he said he expects her home at 8pm.", "I wonder what other rules he has?\n\nThe 8:00 PM rule is an isolation tactic because he knows that people are just going out for the evening at that time, not coming home. I wonder what he will do when she comes home a bit late? I think at that point he will tell her that he can't trust her so he is not going to allow her out at all.", "Well, I do worry a little about my loved ones if they are later than expected getting home. As a courtesy, I let my husband know where I will be and a general time he can expect me home. He does the same.", "Even if he WAS afraid for her after dark, it's not even dark out at 8pm for most of the year - even within his own logic, he's not making sense!", "For real! In High School the sun didn't fully rise untill after school started. And it set before leaving after extracurriculars. Barring weekends, all winter the only sunlight we saw was through classroom windows.", "Mans said he has no friends left\u2026\u2026.might be oblivious?", "Lmao some of my favorite times started after 8 pm", "Yup. I'd nope out of this relationship so fast if I were her. Being expected to be back home by 8pm every single night is crazy. He literally wants to keep her from seeing her friends and family. Can't imagine any reasonable human being (esp in their 40's) who would agree to that.", "Lol yeah i imagine it's like \"she wants me to be home and coherent by 2am \"", "Did you ever see the SNL skit where the women take their husbands to the man park to find friends?  That\u2019s what I thought of with this.  It\u2019s very true though. I know so many men who don\u2019t have guy friends they hang with unless their wife is making plans with the other wife.", "Relevant SNL sketch: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/9XOt2Vh0T8w", "Well, considering he has no friends or family, I think that she might be wanting to get out, so she's not dealing with someone Velcro attached to her, especially given they both wfh.", "But weirdly, it's okay for her to be out for 2-3 hours after dark in the winter! Just not in the summer when it starts light so much later!", "It seems like he could perhaps spend less time doing whatever he does at weekends, rather than expecting her to give up her activities but he\u2019s not even considered that as an option.", "I mean, doesn\u2019t he have work on the weekends?\n\nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d assume would be \u201cprograms\u201d", "I thought the programs meant TV programs.", "Especially as a man, I'd say.\n\n\nAs a woman, I can basically start small talk with most random people and not be seen as a \"threat\". I've befriended several other mothers in our suburbs after we moved here, so I gained 2 friends in the last year.\n\n\nIf my 1,92m (6'3\") bear of a husband tried the same, I'm pretty sure he'd get very different reactions, even if he WAS good at small talk. \n\n\nAfter all, making friends takes basically the same skill set as initiating other relationships, and we all know there's an imbalance there.", "Not the person you're replying to but from my own life I notice that guys don't reach out and they don't volunteer support- they wait until asked, which never happens. \n\nFriendship as an adult requires work, especially if you live in a city or apart from each other. Call up and ask how they're doing. If you hear they're going through a hard time, call up and ASK what they need, or come up with some suggestions- don't make them ask you out of the blue. Have they eaten? Do they want to go out for darts or a hike? Do they have a place to stay? \n\nDo this even when the conversations are guaranteed to be boring and tedious. I don't actually care about my friends' baby/ job drama/ relationship drama but I check in with them anyway, at least once a month or so, and they do the same. When there's been a death, the survivors are going to be boring for a year at least. So will you, when you survive the death of a loved one. \n\nAlso, if they don't reach out when they should, do your best to forgive them. People are awkward. \n\nBut also, just shoehorn in some physical time together, if possible, for a beer or whatever you're into.\n\nNo, I know no one has time. No one. That includes women and yet we do it.", "Idk, I think it\u2019s definitely talking about jobs. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both working at home so we do spend a lot of time together, however, I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s not really time spent together because we\u2019re each busy with our own programs\u201d"]}
