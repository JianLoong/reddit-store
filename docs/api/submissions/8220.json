Context, I (16f) have always been the only grandchildren along with my (17f) sister. Because of this our grandparents spent a lot of time with us. Recently however my uncle and aunt had 2 kids. (toddlers atm) now on to the story.\n\nRecently a close cousin of ours passed away. Her funeral was 2 days after my birthday and 1 day after an orthodontist appointment of mine. This orthodontist appointment made it so it hurt to eat any food that wasn\u2019t soft. (Relevant later) anyway we went to the funeral and after that to the burial. Some of my grandma's family was buried there and so she asked me and my family to look for them and take photos of their graves for her. We did but this took us about 1 1/2 hours so \n\nWhen we finally got to the celebration of life the food was not only cold but almost all gone, now my uncle and his oldest toddler were with us at the cemetery too so they arrived at the celebration of life with us. It\u2019s also worth mentioning I hadn't really eaten anything all day except some snacks. So being that it was 2:00 I was hungry. So I got food that was easy to tear apart and went to sit down. My grandma had my uncle's toddler and all of a sudden started taking my food to give to him. Mind you I told her I couldn\u2019t eat much because my mouth hurt. Well she ended up giving all the food I could eat to my baby cousin leaving me hungry. When I got upset my grandma said \u201cSorry I forget you\u2019re my granddaughter.\u201d I won\u2019t lie that hurt and I didn\u2019t talk to her for the rest of the day.\n\nAnyway, we were at my uncle\u2019s house two days after and she asked me to do something for her and in my genius moment I said \u201cokay *first name* I can do that\u201d when she stared at me in confusion I finally said \u201coh sorry I forgot you were my grandma.\u201d In front of one of my aunts and my grandpa (not her husband) I could tell she tried to laugh it off but it bothered her. I was told by my aunt I should apologize because I needed to be respectful and that wasn\u2019t but I still haven\u2019t apologized and don\u2019t plan to unless I really am in the wrong.
