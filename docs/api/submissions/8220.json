This orthodontist appointment made it so it hurt to eat any food that wasn\u2019t soft. (Relevant later) anyway we went to the funeral and after that to the burial. Some of my grandma's family was buried there and so she asked me and my family to look for them and take photos of their graves for her. We did but this took us about 1 1/2 hours so \n\nWhen we finally got to the celebration of life the food was not only cold but almost all gone, now my uncle and his oldest toddler were with us at the cemetery too so they arrived at the celebration of life with us. It\u2019s also worth mentioning I hadn't really eaten anything all day except some snacks. So being that it was 2:00 I was hungry. So I got food that was easy to tear apart and went to sit down. My grandma had my uncle's toddler and all of a sudden started taking my food to give to him. Mind you I told her I couldn\u2019t eat much because my mouth hurt. Well she ended up giving all the food I could eat to my baby cousin leaving me hungry.

Your grandma and other family members all didn\u2019t want you to eat? So you sat there with a full or partially full plate in front of you, and they told you not to eat any of it?

She may have gotten excited in the moment to be around a baby after so long and accidentally slighted you but you received the lion\u2019s share of the attention so long and now it\u2019s time to grow up and get over yourself and learn to share. You are practically an adult and if you want to be treated like one ACT like one.", "Here\u2019s the thing I\u2019m not jealous of the kid what I\u2019m upset about is that she decided to take food from me after I had told her that that was all I could eat because of my teeth and she still took it. Not to mention the child\u2019s dad had food that he was eating that she should have taken because I am not that child\u2019s mom and I am not that child\u2019s caregiver. The one other thing I was upset with her about was that she made the choice to make an insensitive joke that she as an adult should know better than to say. And while yes I have had built up resentment with her recently it is because she hardly ever speaks to us unless we go above and beyond to speak to her. She probably wouldn\u2019t even visit us if it wasn\u2019t for our parents pointing out her favoritism towards the toddlers. And before you point out that it\u2019s a child I do not care. Child or not throwing two kids you\u2019ve known their entire life and making them feel lesser is never okay in any situation. Especially when she goes above and beyond to see those kids whilst not giving a damn for her other two grandkids. Her comment was just as immature as mine was but the fact is that when I am an adult if someone treats me like that I will actively looking for a way to leave that person if it\u2019s work i don\u2019t care I get to go home eventually with a grandparent who clearly doesn\u2019t care that much she had no right to joke like that anyway.

So, yeah- sorry- unwell.", "> If the comment from grandma wasn\u2019t hurtful, then OP using essentially the same comment shouldn\u2019t be hurtful either. \n\nThis return \"joke\" makes no sense in a completely different context. Grandma possibly meant it in a joking way, such as, \"Oh, so you are particular about your food, I should have known because you are related to me and I get hangry too, haha sorry about that.\" The situation two days later was not parallel, there's nothing Grandma did that would prompt the \"haha we really are related, huh!\" joke. OP's comment came seemingly out of nowhere and apparently made her come across as an AH to other family members. It's pretty clear she meant it bitterly in the sense of, \"I can say the same thing I interpreted as hurtful right back to you to see if it hurts you, and I'm laughing as I say this because I think this comeback is 'genius'.\" In this scenario, Grandma didn't say it with hurtful intent but OP did.\n\n> If it was hurtful, and grandma had forgotten all about it, then this conveyed to her that OP had been hurt by what was said.\n\nNot really, because if Grandma had forgotten about it then she's just left feeling upset and confused why OP is snapping at her. Had OP delivered this quip immediately maybe it could have been effective. \n\n> I don\u2019t know how well a big conversation about it would have gone (\u201cOh OP, you know I was joking!\u201d)\n\nIt could have gone a lot of ways. Maybe Grandma would have been a jerk about it and confirm OP's assumptions in which case OP would act accordingly. Maybe Grandma could have explained she was trying to add some humor into the apology and then given a different apology once she realized OP did not take it well. Maybe Grandma could explain she meant it in a loving way, kind of like when a parent gets busy at work and realizes they've been neglecting their kid and then says, \"I forgot taking care of you is my #1 job.\" Maybe Grandma could explain she was grieving or having other issues. You yourself acknowledge OP's way of dealing with it was not the most mature choice. Point is OP acted on an assumption before getting clarification.
