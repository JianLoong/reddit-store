(toddlers atm) now on to the story.\n\nRecently a close cousin of ours passed away. Her funeral was 2 days after my birthday and 1 day after an orthodontist appointment of mine. This orthodontist appointment made it so it hurt to eat any food that wasn\u2019t soft. (Relevant later) anyway we went to the funeral and after that to the burial. Some of my grandma's family was buried there and so she asked me and my family to look for them and take photos of their graves for her. We did but this took us about 1 1/2 hours so \n\nWhen we finally got to the celebration of life the food was not only cold but almost all gone, now my uncle and his oldest toddler were with us at the cemetery too so they arrived at the celebration of life with us. It\u2019s also worth mentioning I hadn't really eaten anything all day except some snacks. So being that it was 2:00 I was hungry. So I got food that was easy to tear apart and went to sit down. My grandma had my uncle's toddler and all of a sudden started taking my food to give to him. Mind you I told her I couldn\u2019t eat much because my mouth hurt. Well she ended up giving all the food I could eat to my baby cousin leaving me hungry. When I got upset my grandma said \u201cSorry I forget you\u2019re my granddaughter.\u201d I won\u2019t lie that hurt and I didn\u2019t talk to her for the rest of the day.\n\nAnyway, we were at my uncle\u2019s house two days after and she asked me to do something for her and in my genius moment I said \u201cokay *first name* I can do that\u201d when she stared at me in confusion I finally said \u201coh sorry I forgot you were my grandma.\u201d In front of one of my aunts and my grandpa (not her husband) I could tell she tried to laugh it off but it bothered her. I was told by my aunt I should apologize because I needed to be respectful and that wasn\u2019t but I still haven\u2019t apologized and don\u2019t plan to unless I really am in the wrong.

Grandma is elderly & may not be all together & perhaps meant her comment as a joke that fell flat.

Deal with it & be a little grown up & gracious. I am sure you got to eat a bit later since your \"snacks\" earlier in the day were not enough.

For your grandmother, feeding this male baby was automatic and feeding a granddaughter would have been less of a priority.\n\nShe could, because of age, have had a memory lapse.

The other comments and OP are acting like OP got disowned.\n\nAnd I'm sorry but toddler > teenager.

I don't think grandma went about it the right way, but a toddler comes before a 16 year old who can't eat much. \n\nAlso, how is it that OP got to eat none of her own food.

Yes, of course.", "It's not why they have to bring but a responsible parent would bring food. It can be just a jar of fruit puree which is easily stored along with diapers and other necessities. Toddlers going anywhere need a dedicated bag. So it can be implied necessities also include food.\n\nAs for why I  don't feel OP's actions aren't unjustified. \nBelow are the points I considered:\n1. She had an operation done which means the food she could consume was limited.\n2. The reason she missed the meal was due to a task requested by her grandma which she happily complied with.\n3. The excuse provided was basically a cop-out. As well as hurtful to OP.\n4. Why did grandma have to take the food from OP plate itself when OP was already hungry.\n5. Life has shown me numerous times that even with people who I respect. Explicitly stating my boundary is far more conducive to a healthy relationship. Here if she hadn't reacted at all, OP would just be building resentment which would have exploded in the future or this was the explosions after.\n\nI understand OP actions seem selfish( towards toddler) and disrespectful( towards grandma). But do remember OP is still learning about life( 16) and she wanted to probably show grandma how hurtful it was to say she forgot about her being her granddaughter after being so close for so long."]}
