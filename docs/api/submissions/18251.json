We had this conversation several times, I said no each time. Argued a bit, then I thought we came to an agreement on early July. Then she just went ahead and booked the venue for August 6th anyway.\n\n- I told her I did not feel comfortable waiting this long to get my baby the things she needs. I will be 38 weeks, also I am a first time mom. I want to be prepared and I\u2019m worried I could have the baby early (even before the shower), during, or very shortly after. She just says \u201cwell I\u2019ll help set up\u201d.. I can\u2019t really rely on her for that, as she\u2019s very notorious for being flaky.\n\n- I am concerned I may not even be able to make it due to how late in the pregnancy it is. \n\n- In general, she\u2019s been more focused on her friends & coworkers that she\u2019s inviting, along with everybody else\u2019s schedule, that I feel like a total afterthought. \n\nso, basically, my mom tells me she will book for July 16th as this was the earliest the venue we were interested in had available. She tells me a week later the venue is booked, I assumed it\u2019s for the date we agreed upon, so wrote that in the Facebook event. She texts me \u201coh, sorry, your aunt had a wedding that weekend so I just went ahead and did the 6th.\u201d I said \u201cnice. hope I\u2019ll be able to go.\u201d and she just said \u201cit\u2019ll be fine\u201d.\n\nWell. I decided that I am not actually waiting that long to get baby stuff that I need, that\u2019s ridiculous. I feel it\u2019ll be very stressful to have to sort so last minute, deal with duplicate gifts, run out to get what I didn\u2019t get, etc. Therefore, I told guests in the event Facebook to only bring diapers if they choose to bring anything at all as this is so close to the due date & I\u2019d like to be set up before that. I also changed the event name to \u201cDiaper Party\u201d.\n\nMy mom got angry and sent a text asking if I\u2019m SURE I have everything I need (I actually do have most essentials, just a few items I still need). She told me to just get addresses and leave it at that, put a registry on the invite and \u201callow guests to choose what they\u2019d like to get (that is, if they\u2019d like to bring something)\u201d. I said, no, I do not want to wait that long to get what I need & anything I don\u2019t have, I will get on my own well before 38 weeks. Now she\u2019s acting petty and won\u2019t talk to me. \n\nI\u2019m very angry that she lied to me, did her own thing & is now making me out to be some difficult spoiled brat for asking to NOT receive gifts. I feel in a way, she\u2019s TA, but.. I feel worried that I\u2019m being petty myself, and I understand she is planning for me which is great, but..

Lots of first time moms have the baby a bit later but at that point, you may just want to chill and relax.

You will need BOXES of diapers, so many onesies, blankets, etc. Or if money isn't really much of an issue, have it be a donation to a charity in your name thing. Who knows.

She made sure to accommodate everyone except you!", "NTA.\nYour requests were very reasonable and practical. 38 weeks is definitely too late to wait.

By that point in the pregnancy everything will be a huge pain and it will be really hard to have a good time and relax. \n\nCongratulations on your baby and best wishes!", "NTA. And sorry, but I had trouble getting past *booking a venue* for a baby shower. Isn\u2019t this just meant to be a little gathering in someone\u2019s home, or maybe a couple of tables in a restaurant?

You are not refusing to go, though you would be well justified in doing so. You are declining gifts and buying everything yourself.

She\u2019s Japanese and had never had one with the other three due to my son being in the military and stationed in Japan.

I got a call from my son at 1 am on the 24th asking me if her water broke since she had a gush of water tinted with blood. (Totally normal should it happen to you!) I told him yes and to bring to kids to me so she could be taken to the hospital. I was there with her and my son when the baby was born. The kids were in the waiting room with my daughter since she wanted them there to meet their new brother. I was asked to be with her and my son since all her family was in Japan. Sorry for the rambling! Anyhoo- the point is the baby could come early just as my grandson did and you need to be set up. Your mom is worried about keeping up appearances with her friends and coworkers and making the shower about her and NOT you or the baby!

I was fine with the venue being wherever, just wanted a reasonable date. We \u201cagreed\u201d on a date.. then she just went ahead and did her own thing anyway.\n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. regardless I have friends planning a smaller one for me in June so I still get to have one.", "I'm so excited for you and your baby.  I'm glad that you have someone focused on you and your needs.", "You really should just tell your mom to have fun at 'her' shower because you won't be there.", "Nta. However I would not go to the one in August. Pregnant or Postpartum don\u2019t go.  If your still pregnant, your going to be uncomfortable the whole time. If baby is already hear, they be at risk with their immune system not up to par.  Frankly it sounds like mom wanted so late so she could have a meet my grand baby shower.  If you have the baby early, under not circumstances do you take them around this many people.", "That's great!", "They planned my mom's shower for her due date and she went into labor with me that day and missed it. My dad's mom (who belongs in JustNoMIL sub for many reasons) decided since everyone was already at her house for it that she would open all the presents and set everything up to \"help\". So glad your friends are doing that June shower for you, because this should be about what YOU need, not your mom or cousin or anyone else. Congratulations on your baby and I hope your shower, pregnancy and birth experience are all wonderful for you \u2764\ufe0f", "Yeah sounds like your mom is making your baby shower about her rather than you and your baby. I think sometimes moms of daughters miss the attention or something. Maybe not quite that but it does feel like she\u2019s taking the spotlight off you. And like it\u2019s not about attention but you\u2019re about to start a new chapter in your life that\u2019s going to be pretty intense. You get to be selfish at least one more time lol.", "In that case limiting the registry to diapers seems much more appropriate. NTA", "Good grief! \ud83e\udd23", "It absolutely was. She gives exactly 0 fucks about you. This is entirely for her and about her.", "Well, that\u2019s good.  It sounds like your mom is centering herself in all of this.", "She can listening  but she does what she wants.  That means she doesn't HEAR you.  She doesn't respect you.\n\nWhat if you don't go the shower?  Its clearly not for you.  Its for her and her circle, not yours.\n\nIf your baby comes early, it could solve the problem for you.", "Sounds like you'll have another shower with people who actually respect you.  So...maybe just not attend the other one =)?  It's pretty clear that the other shower is meant to accommodate your mother and her guests, not your wishes.", "That\u2019s a good point, she might see it that way.. but, I agree. People defended my mom saying if she\u2019s here I could take her, but there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d be dragging a very newborn baby into an event full of people.", "Right?! I was feeling the same way, like she wanted some of the \u201cspotlight\u201d off of me..\n\nBut the comment that got me the most was \u201clet the guests choose what they\u2019d like to bring (if anything)\u201d. Like.. it\u2019s a fucking baby shower. I never said I expected everybody to gift large luxury items, but I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s unreasonable of me to expect that most people are going to bring *something* to a BABY SHOWER \ud83d\ude44 and ohh, what a jerk I am for not waiting until the last possible second to get my child the things she needs, meaning I am not allowing the guests the opportunity to choose what they get me. \ud83d\ude27 clearly, it\u2019s the guests who will be suffering here\ud83e\udd23", "And change the password so Grandma can't hijack anything", "I\u2019m honestly rsvp\u2019ing maybe, my mom has literally told me \u201cI better show up and socialize\u201d (with the work friends and distant relatives ofc, to make her look good). I told her no promises on if I even *can* be there. And since I don\u2019t see her easing up and not being a jerk anytime between now and then, if there isn\u2019t actually something stopping me then I\u2019m just going to say I\u2019m sick/in the hospital and not go.", "Preach. Leave it to a mom to try and make arguments like \u201cthink about your guests though\u201d It would be wonderfully ironic if you went into labor around then lol. \nMight as well start putting up boundaries as well cause if your mom is anything like mine, she\u2019ll want to have way too much day in how you raise your own kid \ud83d\ude2d", "Baby clothes in different sizes are always an option.", "Hahaha, I like how you think."]}
