While I\u2019ve drank before, it\u2019s usually while at a restaurant or in the comfort of my own home. I\u2019ve been to a bar maybe twice in my whole life.\n\nAnyway, last night, I went out with two friends. We got dinner and I had two drinks there. Then we went to a bar and had a couple of shots before heading to another, more shots and a few drinks. It was there I started to feel very sick. I told my friends I was ready to go, they didn\u2019t have to come but I\u2019d order an Uber. They tried telling me to just drink some water and I\u2019d be okay.\n\nI waited 15 minutes and I was still feeling worse. The bar was understandably loud and rowdy. I felt overstimulated, sick and just wanted to be out of there. Finally, I firmly told them I was leaving and called for an Uber. I decided to wait outside because again, it was so loud. One of my friends walked me out and then went back in. I was in my Uber within a few minutes. Texted both when I was in the Uber and then when I got home safe. Went to sleep. \n\nI woke up with a slight hangover but better than it would\u2019ve been if I stayed. One of my friends called and said me leaving was super dangerous. That given how drunk I was anything could\u2019ve happened. She lectured me on how I should\u2019ve stayed with them. I said I didn\u2019t want to be there anymore but they clearly didn\u2019t want to leave and I didn\u2019t want to ruin their fun.\n\nAITA?q", "created_utc": 1679240493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vojno/aita_for_leaving_a_bar_by_myself_early/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they were so worried that getting an uber alone while drunk was unsafe, they could have gone with you. NTA.", "NTA. If they were so worried about your safety they should have gone with you. They seem a little self absorbed.", "NTA If it was super dangerous why didn\u2019t they stay with you until you got inside the Uber, make contact with driver( so they saw they were recognized) and ask that you text the moment you got inside the safety of your home? Better yet, they could have escorted you home IF they were indeed that worried, and gone back out.", "NTA. What the fuck? I\u2019ve been in your position on several occasions, and my friends are always super supportive. Not only that, but they wait outside with me until they\u2019re certain that I\u2019m in the right car. Sometimes they\u2019re even the ones to call me an uber. \n\nEveryone has their own limits. Just because you need to leave a little earlier than your friends doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing anything wrong, nor does it put you in danger in any way.", "NTA and your friend is a piece of work. If she cared so much about your safety, she could have gone with you.  You texted when you got home so she wasn't worried.", "NTA but your friends are. If they were really concerned, they should have made sure you got in your taxi when you weren\u2019t feeling well is awful advice or even accompanied you. Guilting you about not staying out and applying scare tactics, just makes it worse. Find better friends.", "NTA. If they were worried about your safety, they should have taken you home safely. You said you weren't feeling well and they didn't seem to care, so what were you supposed to do??", "NTA - you're a grown ass adult and you can make your own decisions. You told them you were getting an Uber, it's not like you just disappeared into the night and walked blind drunk down every alley in town. You were tipsy, uncomfortable, and made the right call to go home. You did nothing wrong.", "NAH- glad you made it home safe.", "Sounds like your friend is feeling a little guilty and is choosing to blame you.", "NTA. If they were that concerned about you getting home, they should have gone with you. Staying out when you've drank too much isn't fun even if you enjoy being in loud bars.", "NTA It sounds like you were sober enough to make smart decisions. If they were genuinely concerned they would have left with you at the expense of what they wanted to do instead of just walk a drunk out and send them on their merry way. I hate loud places too and see why that might have been a factor", "NAH\n\nWhile it *can* be dangerous to leave early - UBER generally does pretty good with their background checks and who they hire overall (at least in my area). You also told them you were home and safe.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
