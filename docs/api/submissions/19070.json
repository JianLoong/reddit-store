You informed your friend about your upcoming out-of-country trip and specified the dates you'd be gone. She would consider it when planning her wedding. Your friend wants you to cancel or change your plans, disregarding your prior obligations and financial constraints.\n\n It's unfair for her to expect you to change plans, especially after you've already arranged an important event. Her lack of interest in your life events like engagement and elopement is disappointing. It's normal to feel hurt when a close friend lacks interest or fails to congratulate during important occasions. It's important to communicate openly with your friend and express your feelings. There may be underlying issues that need addressing. Good communication helps solve conflicts and strengthen connections.", "NTA\n\nCongratulations on your engagement, btw! You have told your best friend time and time again that you won't be free around that time, but she ignored/forgot about that info and proceeded to get angry at you even when it was her fault. It's not right of her to expect *you* to change events while she not doing anything. She's the AH here", ">never asked questions about the man I\u2019ve been dating the past 3 years.\n\nIt sounds like you are her friend but she isn't really a good friend to you. It also sounds like she intentionally booked her wedding while you would be gone and then wants you to cancel not only your trip but also your elopement. Does she think that you are stealing her thunder? It's also suspect that hers is 2 days before yours so she can get married first and \"win\" the marriage game.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou made your availability clear from the start, she clearly has no interest in your wedding/plans if she expects you to just move them and shell out a ton of money right before it.", "NTA. Your friend is a self centered twit. Does she not know the definition of \"elope\". You are, as she is, getting married. You're just doing it without all the fanfare. You were gracious enough when she began planning her wedding to inform her that you will be out of the country. It's not your problem that schedule does not align with hers; that's life.\n\nAnd good for you as far as not bowing to her pressure as far as her bachelorette party. Number one, no one needs to be shelling out $ 1,500+ for that. No one. Second, you would be 96 hours out from departure. You need that time to take care of any last minute details as there's always last minute details...always. You'd be cutting it too close anyway. \n\nLet her give you the silent treatment and sulk all she wants. You go do you and have a fantastic beach wedding.", "NTA its absolutely not ur fault, u did everything in your power to make this as peaceful as possible and shes just ignoring your plans and needs.", "NTA. She\u2019s not YOUR friend. She just wants your money. She purposely chose september 15th for her wedding date. She is competing with you. I repeat, she is NOT your friend.", "NTA. \n\nYou have been very open about going on this trip. And as such you can\u2019t make it. You\u2019re right she doesn\u2019t have to plan around you. But if it was so important for her to have you there then she should have adjusted accordingly. \n\nAlso 1000 dollars for a bachelorette party is outside of many people\u2019s price range. You should have no shame or regret skipping that event as well. \n\nAlso you tossed in at the end that she in the three years you have been with your fianc\u00e9 has not asked about him, met him, been interested or wanted to meet and get to know him? Sounds like you aren\u2019t actually that close to begin with I mean she seems to not be invested in you and your life. So I would put her on the back burner. Don\u2019t ice her out but maybe it\u2019s time she put in the effort herself. Seems like you\u2019re the one doing most of the heavy lifting to make things work and I guarantee you that there will be more people who will want to be your friend and be interested in your life and what\u2019s going on because that\u2019s what friends do.", "NTA. You have no obligation to attend anyone else\u2019s wedding. The flip side of this is that no one is under obligation to factor in your plans to their wedding, and it seems like you fully accept this fact so just hold your ground.", "NTA.  Absolutely not.  Who goes to an all inclusive the week before their wedding?  And expects the bridesmaids and friends to fork that kind of $$$ out? Nope.  unrealistic.", "NTA. \n\nYou had plans, you communicated those plans, and those are very big plans! She knew all of this and has made it clear she doesn't care. \n\nLet her be radio silent. I'm sorry, that sucks, and I know it hurts, but you can't control her reaction, you have nothing to apologize for, and and you can't make her be a rational person or a caring friend. \n\nI had a friend get engaged and planned their wedding a year in advance, 6 months before the wedding, my other best friend go engaged and said they wanted to get married quickly. I immediately told them (in a kind way, at an appropriate time), that given their time frame, that they lived on the other side of the country from me, and that they knew about this other wedding, he couldn't count on me to do an in person bachelor party, and if he wanted me there had to consider the other wedding date. He of course was totally understanding, had a march wedding, so I did a trip to them in March, then another trip out in July for the other wedding. \n\nI only tell that story to say- friends consider each other. He could have done whatever he wanted for his wedding, but he wanted me there and knew I had other commitments. Your friend knew you had this trip, then knew this trip wasn't just a trip but basically a wedding, and made it clear that while you are a priority to be at her wedding, your actual life is not a priority for her. \n\nSo, know this. You did nothing wrong, you even overcommunicated about an elopement! And you aren't a bad friend for not postponing your life for her wedding. And definitely don't waste a dime on celebrating her when she can't even be bother to congratulate you.", "Obviously, you're not each others best friend. When my best friend booked a date and told me , I straighaway made space for her , I would never miss her wedding. The same she's doing for me now . We've been friends for more than 20 years .", "Nta. \n\nMan I wish I had rich people problems like this.

At least given the timeline you presented of your eloping annoucnement and then so soon after her setting the date to a time when she knew you weren't there... am I *wrong* to read something pointed and petty in there? \"*You decided to get married without me there, so how about these apples!?\"*\n\nIf it was something clearly communicated about how it sucks, but this was the only time frame that both sets of grandparents would be able to attend so they had to make a hard choice, and so sorry, you'll be there in spirit though, right...

You were very clear about your trip and the date. If it would have been someone who actually cared, this person would have expressed that she'd have loved seeing you at her wedding, but that she is also VERY happy for YOU. \n\nAnd be pretty sure that in a healthy friendship, the two of you would even send each other pictures of your important events, to feel closer to each other, to SHARE each other's happiness, even in the distance. \n\nAnyway, I do hope you and your significant other have a blast at that trip.

Your trip was planned ahead, she knew and still wants to put her stuff clashing with it. And what's with the exorbitant cost?? Your friend seems to want to be the only very special bride tbh.\n\nHow long are you planning to come to Australia for? I'm not sure if you or your fiance know all the details but before you can legally get married in Australia you generally have to submit a Notice of Intent to Marry and that needs to be submitted to the relevant BDM registry at least one month before your marriage ceremony. So if you're getting married on 17 September you will need to have that done at least by 17 August, and it may take a bit of time for you to get all your documents notarised and witnessed and etc. Since you only mentioned  coming here in September I wanted to make sure you knew about that - you cannot simply rock up at a court house or church and get married on the spot like happens in TV/movies. And I assume that since you want to move between Australia and the US, you do plan for your elopement to actually be a legal marriage and not just a placeholder/personal ceremony. Sorry if you do know all this already - just wanted to mention as someone who got married in a different country and has navigated various immigration procedures. Both AU and USA have notoriously strict immigration rules and I know it would suck if you had to delay or change your plans because of stuff you didn't know about. (My husband and I were separated for about 8 weeks, a month after our wedding because of immigration hoopla :() Good luck!", "What is the mwaning of the word \"elope\" in this context?

Thank you again :)", "Eloping is basically a more private ceremony! So instead of having 100 people there it\u2019ll just be him & I and our two witnesses on the beach with the person marrying us! But yes eloping is essentially getting married! Just private and personal!", "Glad you have it sorted! Hope you guys are happy together for a long time :)", "NTA  You clearly informed your friend of when you would be out of the country.  If she wanted you at her wedding, she should have not scheduled it for the exact time you're away.  If she cares more about the right date than whether you're there, she should accept your absence with good grace, wish you a great trip and a wonderful elopement and maybe you could plan a last girls' dinner or something in August.   She can't have it both ways and she doesn't get to be mad at you for not making your life revolve around her.", "NTA. You're losing a friend but gaining a husband, so that's nice!", "NTA. She wants to get married first bit can't force you to change your plans."]}
