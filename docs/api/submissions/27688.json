Today, two women parked in my space at the same time for 5-10 minutes so I waited until they came back with their kids and let them know, very calmly, that this is private property and they couldn't park here. They kinda fought back, saying the previous resident had allowed them to park there and it was only a few minutes anyways so I should allow it. I said \"I'm really sorry but I'm expecting someone to come home soon and they'll need to use the space\" and walked back into my house. I overheard them trash talking me through the window, saying things like \"new tenant new attitude\" etc. \n\nAITA? I pay to live here, I feel like it should be up to me to decide who parks on my space, even if it's sitting empty. There is plenty of free street parking around my house too - it would only add 30 seconds of walking to park there instead of my space.\n\nEdit to add some info:\n\n1) I rent, not own, but cost of the parking space is included in my rent\n2) I don't have a car, but the space gets used by people who I invite over, as is the case today", "created_utc": 1695760250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sz1zy/aita_for_asking_people_not_to_park_in_my_driveway/", "score": 236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My kids ride the bus but we routinely get reminders in emails not to block driveways etc when picking kids up.

I have a long driveway and live near a large school bus stop. Parents will drive their kids to the bus stop and sit in their cars at the end of my driveway so their little darlings don't get cold or wet. I have been late to work because I can't get them to move their asses out of my driveway. They're like \"We just need to sit here for a few more minutes until the bus comes.\" And that sucks because those few minutes make me late and then I get stuck behind the slow-ass schoolbus all the way to the freeway.\n\nWhen I was a kid, we walked our butts to the bus stop and stood outside until the bus got there and we were fine. And this was in Colorado, where it snowed. Now I'm in Seattle where it hardly ever freezes. These kids don't need to be coddled by being driven to the bus stop, dammit!!!", "Well\u2026because maybe it wasn\u2019t good for us to be walking 1/2 mile to grade school in the first place?  And now that parents can actually pick their kids up, they do?  \n\nThere were a lot of things older generations had to do.  That doesn\u2019t mean our kids should do them if we can avoid that.

Why the f*ck would you subject a kid to that just because your parents subjected you to it?", "This happened to a friend of mine. She tried talking and it was in vain. So she hatched a plan. She placed a sign on the edge of her lawn that said \u2018no parking, private property\u2019 then she contacted a local towing company and made arrangements for them to have 2 tow trucks parked around the corner, as soon as, a car pulled up and parked she called them. This went on for a few day and then just like that it stopped.

I mean we feel like we are babying our kids by walking them to and from the bus stop (no sidewalks and semi heavy traffic so I feel I should until they\u2019re a little older).", "We had a neighbor family that would load their teenage daughters up, if it was too cold or raining, then drive them to the end of the driveway to wait for the school bus. The driveway was about 75ft long, and the bus stopped at the end of the driveway. Even the teens thought their mom was a bit overprotective.", "Why wouldn't a half mile walk be good for kids?  My kids walked it for primary school.  Now the youngest walks a bit less than that to get the city bus to high school.  A relatively short walk isn't a bad thing for kids.", "Love this. Now this I would do!", "At the school behind me the streets are filled at 1:45 for 2:45 dismissal. The catchment is very small, the longest walk would be 10 minutes. I don't know where all these people are coming from.", "Your choice, no judgment.  I don\u2019t want my child walking a half mile to school for the all the obvious reasons, beginning with the fact of danger and ending with the fact that I have a car and can pick her up.
