They might have been working in the city miles away and picking them up on their way back. Most parents work so won\u2019t have just been sitting at home waiting to pick them up. Even if they\u2019re stay at home parents they might have been out running errands before pick up.", "The news makes parents paranoid to leave their kids at the bus stop.  The pervs, the other kids, it sucks.  \n\ni can relate to your Colorado bus stop.  So many wet feet days. But I am old.", "The vast majority of danger to children walking to and from school comes from the cars parents are driving. Further, there have been studies linking walking to school with better academic performance; [https://www.saferoutespartnership.org/safe-routes-school/101/benefits](https://www.saferoutespartnership.org/safe-routes-school/101/benefits) has some factoids. There are also few times safer for a kid to walk than shortly before and after school, when there are a large number of other children around (safety in numbers), police are around in larger numbers to keep an eye on all the traffic (I've seen a police car drive down the street from the elementary school four times this month and I'm usually not out and about during school pick-up hours; my coworkers come from within a 40-mile spread and all mention how many more police we see during those hours every year) and walking led me personally to being able to learn street names, navigate my neighborhood, and other skills that transferred to driving as an adult a lot smoother than many of my peers.\n\nYou may not want your kid to walk unaccompanied, and I don't know your child's age or if they have any disabilities or if your area has any environmental factors that make doing so particularly bad (such as living in a smoggy city), but I'm a huge advocate for kids walking to school if they live a reasonable distance. You could team up with other parents for a weekly Walking Bus (get a group of parents who'll walk around picking up twenty or so kids and all walk together, 4 or 5 adults supervising and can swap out each week, so the kids get exercise and independence and can walk with friends. Addresses safety concerns and can greatly reduce traffic) if you'd like to give it a try.", "Your choice, but with judgment. Assuming it's not along a highway or something. why don't you just walk with your kid? You have the time to drive them, walking that short of a distance will add a negligible amount of time, and might even be faster, depending on the traffic and length of the drop-off/pick-up lines.", "1/2 of a mile??? A few hundred meters???Are you saying you're too lazy to walk this short distance with your child (if the safety is the issue)?  \nYes, you have a car.  \nBut I asume that you and your child both have a pair of legs, also?  \nEdit:  \ntypo", "Agreed. Many people, myself included, should value walking more and try to do it more often.", "No, but those \"facts\" can easily be googled to see if they check out.\n\nI'm curious about this newer understanding concerning children being unaccompanied.  What age do you and other parents think a child can walk a half mile in familiar territory unaccompanied?", "Thanks.  I was beginning to feel a little nuts.  I thought the somewhat younger crowd here would get it (*you* did, whether you are younger or not).\n\nYou know what was even better?  Walking a 1/2 mile to school without some surreptitious tracker of Mom's on me, or the surveillance capability of a cell phone.  Kids have so much less of unsurveiled independence than earlier kids did.  I do feel sad for them.", "I walked alone or with friends in elementary school. Even high schoolers are driven these days. My kids walked the one mile straight up the road. The middle school and high school are beside each other. The traffic is a nightmare. They had the middle school start time earlier than high school, wanting parents to drop all their kids there and have the older ones walk next door. Yeah right. The next year they made the high school start time even later. Brilliant. The kids with after school jobs now have to stay later. I had to start picking my son up on work days to get him there on time.", "Suburbia doesn\u2019t automatically equal safety. I live in the suburbs & last year there were a group of teens assaulting kids walking to & from school. It\u2019s very rare to see anyone walking to school now.", "We used to live near (not next to) my old school and I saw quite a few time parents taking naps in their car at 1pm (not rolling up at 1pm, already asleep snoring at 1pm) for a 3pm dismissal.", "Okay, well, statistically there is less violent crime today than there was when I was a kid. So the news might make people feel less safe, but they aren't actually less safe.\n\nKids need unstructured time with their peers to figure out how to work stuff out and be self-sufficient. I spent a lot of time with other kids and no adults when I was a kid. I learned to deal with bullies and assholes. It's a basic life skill.\n\nAnyway, the bus stop by my house is luxurious. It's got well-lit sidewalks and its own path, it's got a roof, lights, benches and a heater that's all paid for and maintained by our HOA. The kids are barely outside. There is no reason for them to sit in their parents' running cars, clogging up the streets and making me late for work.", "I don\u2019t think you can be a huge advocate for my child walking to school.  You can be advocate for *your child* walking to school.  Whether my child walks to school has nothing to do with you. \n\nMy child performs just fine in school, thank you.", "Can I ask why it\u2019s your business or concern?  I assume you have spellcheck\u2026.", "I did a mix of taking the bus and being driven to/from school. My first school was too dangerous to walk to (distance and safety) so my dad drove me to and I took the bus from school. Second school was almost all by bus. Third school was by bus the first year and a mix of car and bus the next two years. My HS years were mostly by car. \n\nThe majority of the car usage was due to a sibling having medical issues as the bus was not a safe option for them at the time. And it would\u2019ve made no sense for me to take the bus when my dad was already driving one kid.", "No, I don't. English is not my language, so the spell-check marks all the words red ;).   \nBut, yes, I noticed my mistake now and I'm going to correct it.  \nWhat is my business or concern?   \nJust the same like yours commenting - because I'm here and I can. Simple, isn't it?", "Okay, well, that was my response to your comment."]}
