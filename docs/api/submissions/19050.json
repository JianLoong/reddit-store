You're painting a false narrative as if this is some kind of etiquette breach with you as the wronged party, but you cheated on your wife multiple times, and have burned all your bridges with her family, so it's no surprise that they no longer want anything to do with you. Your wife is an ADULT and is free to make her own choices. You do not get to micromanage her life and if she wants to attend a major family event - that you were not invited to - that is her right; and she can take HER children if they want to go see their cousins. Doubling down and ignoring the fact that YOUR actions screwed up these relationships is NO path to fixing this. Get off your high horse and take ownership of the results of your bad behaviors.", "INFO: u/foxfire1730 asked this in the comments, but I think you really need to tell us why your in-laws are adamant you don't come.

You have what you describe as a \"strained\" relationship with your in-laws. The right thing to do is *not* to block your wife and children's relationship with their family. *That* is unfair (and selfish) and will cause your relationship with your in-laws to become even more *strained*.\n\nBe the bigger person.

Second, you treated her terribly in the past- of course her family doesn\u2019t like you. Third, the kids shouldn\u2019t be held responsible for YOUR bad behavior. It is obvious that you are being excluded for being unfaithful- why would you further compound the problem by throwing a temper tantrum and refusing to let your kids go to a family wedding? Own up to your mistakes, acknowledge that there are consequences to your actions, and that one of those consequences is that your wife\u2019s family doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you. You did this to yourself- you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to live with it. Don\u2019t keep your kids from their family out of spite.

Now they're sitting back and giving your wife an out if it's ever needed. I say good for them. The onus is on YOU to fix that strained relationship, cause you're the who fucked it up.

What could they learn from a mom who forgives they father but shames him continuously by leaving him out of holidays and ceremonies for something he did years ago, but she supppsedly forgave him for ?
