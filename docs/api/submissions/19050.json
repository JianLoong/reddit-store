You're painting a false narrative as if this is some kind of etiquette breach with you as the wronged party, but you cheated on your wife multiple times, and have burned all your bridges with her family, so it's no surprise that they no longer want anything to do with you. Your wife is an ADULT and is free to make her own choices. You do not get to micromanage her life and if she wants to attend a major family event - that you were not invited to - that is her right; and she can take HER children if they want to go see their cousins. Doubling down and ignoring the fact that YOUR actions screwed up these relationships is NO path to fixing this. Get off your high horse and take ownership of the results of your bad behaviors.", "INFO: u/foxfire1730 asked this in the comments, but I think you really need to tell us why your in-laws are adamant you don't come.

You have what you describe as a \"strained\" relationship with your in-laws. The right thing to do is *not* to block your wife and children's relationship with their family. *That* is unfair (and selfish) and will cause your relationship with your in-laws to become even more *strained*.\n\nBe the bigger person.

Second, you treated her terribly in the past- of course her family doesn\u2019t like you. Third, the kids shouldn\u2019t be held responsible for YOUR bad behavior. It is obvious that you are being excluded for being unfaithful- why would you further compound the problem by throwing a temper tantrum and refusing to let your kids go to a family wedding? Own up to your mistakes, acknowledge that there are consequences to your actions, and that one of those consequences is that your wife\u2019s family doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you. You did this to yourself- you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to live with it. Don\u2019t keep your kids from their family out of spite.

Apparently they told wife that she either comes just her and the kids or doesn't come at all.  OP complained they were \"forcing her to act like a single mother\" because they had to do separate holidays and such as OP was never welcome to attend anything.\n\nSo....the non wedding invitation was just a continuation of the situation that already existed.

You're not doing that, you're clearly not very repentant.", "You don't get to be impatient that they haven't forgiven you for your bad actions yet.\n\nEver.\n\nYou are not, and never will be, \"owed\" forgiveness. That's not how forgiveness works. If they still resent you for the rest of all of your lives, the only person you can blame for it is *yourself*. \n\nMake your peace with this fact.", "They have every right to hate him.", "The best is when the edits unwittingly make it EVEN WORSE. Like just take the L.", "This. The fact he just grazed aside it shows he is hiding something", "YTA. You failed to leave out your various affairs.", "It's way worse than tax evasion. He made it sound like that was what he was doing by paying her under the table so as to avoid reporting her income to the IRS... the reality us there WAS no income to report because he didn't pay her for her work. At all.", "OP cheated on her as he says \u201cchronic infidelity\u201d. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be defended.", "Aw, but he edited to add that he has already repented enough, so he shouldn't have to face consequences or have strangers think he's trash any more. Can't you just leave him alone and let him be the final arbiter of the validity of everyone else's feelings?", "This is the definition of play stupid games win stupid prizes.\n\nThe fact OP didn't come out and say listen this is what I did years ago, I messed up and he tried to hide it speaks volumes that he still hasn't learned anything from he screw up and he likely used the kids to weasel his way back in\n\nAnd the fact that he then tried to say his kids can't go because he can't go because he screwed is some next level narcissism.\n\nHe is punishing his family for his screw up (I'm not even gonna say mistake because the way it comes across is the mistake he made in his mind was getting caught\n\n\nAnd I'm going to go out on another limb and say that the family didn't love him prior to the infidelity either. If he is pulling crap like this now, I bet he was pulling crap like this the whole time they knew him.", "I think karma is already headed his way with the lack of invitation. Let's hope for the best!", "Very well said", "Upvoting for \u201cchuckle-fuck\u201d \ud83d\ude02 Mind if I borrow that sometime?", "Yes!", "Was wondering the same thing. Like everyone's invited but him and in his post he didn't state WHY so it HAD to be something really bad.", "I think my favorite Reddit thing is when a cocky OP's post backfires and they get rocked in the comments", "I didn\u2019t even bother checking the comments, or his post history. As soon as he said it wasn\u2019t \u201cfair\u201d, I knew: oh, you\u2019re a toddler. Okay. Cool.", "In some cases, it will be because the whole thing is a work of fiction, and the OP planned it that way.", "I think they meant they're confused as to *why* they *choose* to do this. Like as if we won't find out hahaha", "I don\u2019t agree with this, but I appreciate your opinion. To me, it\u2019s the wife\u2019s choice to reconcile with her husband. It\u2019s the family\u2019s choice to set a boundary, support the their sister/daughter etc and not support the cheating/financially abusive husband. They\u2019re both equally entitled to their choice. I think people can also invite and not invite whoever they want to their wedding.", "He didn\u2019t even pay her. It is worse then paying off the books. She got a stipend for groceries. Look how grateful he was", "He's saying now *is* ten years later. But if someone cheats on my sibling not once, not twice, but in a *serial* fashion, I probably don't want to look at them in the sea of guests faces as my partner and I are pledging to be faithful to one another forever. YTA OP.", "Why. Because he cheated 10 years ago but got forgiven and had kids with his wife in the meantime ? Or because of an argument they don't even care to resolve for the sake of op's family, mostly for their kids ? I  the end, the one suffering is them, and you all are encouraging such actions without thinking of the consequences.", "But it is his business\u2026 and he gave her a stipend for groceries! She should be grateful\n\n\nUgh", "Lolololol", "What's interesting to me is that he thought that his chronic cheating was all swept under the infidelity rug in his MIL's house, so when his SIL was supposedly disrespectful to an elder (there is a comment on here somewhere about it), OP decided to be Mr. Respectful, apparently.  Which I find really funny because he had repeatedly been disrespectful to his wife and their marriage.  \n\nIf OP had changed, grown up, and matured, he would have realized that lecturing somebody on their behavior was very hypocritical, and perhaps he should just keep his mouth shut.  So now, because he stuck his nose where it didn't belong, and failed to keep his mouth shut (history shows he has a habit of sticking body parts where they don't belong and keeping his zipper shut) he is not invited to that SIL's wedding.  \n\nThe liberal snowflake in me feels bad for him, being excluded from the wedding, but the woman in me is saying... this is what happens when you stick your dick in somebody other than your wife/significant other.", "By all means! Make it a thing! One of my fave insults for fools.", "It is incredibly rare that someone is universally disliked for absolutely no valid reason.  .  .and if her family were despicable assholes he would have mentioned it. So, yes, \"What did you do!?\", was probably everyone's initial thought.", "LOL", "Oh so it was a mistake and someone tripped and fell on your dick? Yeah, YTA.", "Probably because they thought you had changed and were no longer an AH. Then you burst that bubble\u2026\n\nAnd/or they were putting up with for the sake of your wife but you just couldn\u2019t resist crossing a line and it was no longer worth holding back", "Serial cheating isn\u2019t a mistake. It\u2019s a series of really bad choices that you absolutely had control over.", "They were only remaining civil for your wife and your children. Not for you. That still doesn't mean you get to be included in a *wedding* where the main component is two people *vowing to be committed to each other*.     \n\nI wouldn't want you there either.", "I don't really understand how more people don't see what you're saying through this whole sub-thread. The cheating was \\~10 years ago? The wife forgave the guy and has kids with him. He is the father of the IL's nieces/nephews/grandkids now. At some point you gotta burry the hatchet. All the ILs are doing is stressing the marriage, which if now a healthy relationship, is likely to only hurt their daughter and the kids.\n\nIL are complete AHs here and the wife is making the wrong choice to allow her family to be manipulated by her sister/parents.\n\nBut I'm old enough to have seen similar situations many times now. Family members are willing to hold grudges and use what ever little power they have when they have it, like a wedding invitation, to spite someone they don't like. The ILs probably have too much pride wrapped up in hating the guy now to make amends and the wife probably just wants to keep both parties minimally happy being stuck in the middle.", ">this is what happens when you stick your dick in somebody other than your wife/significant other.\n\nFacts. This guy dug his own hole, and now he's burying himself.", "I am also stealing it, but you are welcome to steal one of my faves; *CHESTICLES*", "Thanks for replying ! I'm happy that someone else could see this side of the story... have a nice day/night :)", "If he was smart (evidence leads me to believe he isn't), he would get some therapy and make some serious changes.  His wife let him get away with cheating on her, multiple times, so he has learned that there are not consequences for his actions... when it comes to her.\n\nHowever, he is now learning that her family is a different story.\n\nThe fact that his go-to response was to tell his wife that she couldn't take the kids, shows that he hasn't learned a god damn thing and grown up in the 7-10 years since his dick accidentally found it's way into multiple women that weren't his wife.", "Would those be lady titties or man titties?", "Whatever your preference is!!!!", "It can be lost and earned back too.... If the family is holding on to a 10 year old grudge that the wife has moved beyond, they are the AHs and the wife is too for letting it persist."]}
