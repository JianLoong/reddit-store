Our friends walked in literally a minute later, but by then the man pulled the manager aside to complain and ask him to kick us out. The manager handled it calmly and explained to the man that seats are first come first serve and said it wouldn\u2019t be right to kick us out when we\u2019d grabbed the table and our friends did come in very shortly after we sat down.

He got really mad and complained to the manager, and I didn\u2019t feel good about either course of action - giving up a table just as my friends were arriving or holding spots when it was busy.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You weren't holding them for hours. It was a couple minutes. This guy sounds like a treat.", "NTA Your friends were parking. That\u2019s legitimate.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong in this situation. You and your fianc\u00e9 arrived before your friends and were able to secure a table. It's not uncommon for people to hold tables while waiting for their friends or family to arrive, and you were well within your rights to do so. The fact that you got up to order after only waiting a few minutes shows that you were not trying to hog the table for an unreasonable amount of time.\n\nThe man who threw a fit over the seats was being unreasonable and entitled. It's not your fault that he didn't arrive earlier and was unable to get a table. The manager handled the situation correctly by explaining the first-come-first-serve policy and not allowing the entitled man to bully you out of your table.\n\nSo, enjoy your coffee and time with your friends and don't worry about the entitled man and his partner. They need to learn to be more patient and respectful of others.", "NTA if there's no 'buy food before taking a seat' rule what you did is perfectly normal in my eyes.", "NTA. Parking the car is the same as being there.", "NTA. That man was dramatic and ridiculous. There's no reason to get that upset about seats.", "NTA. Some people always default to throwing a hissy fit anytime they can't immediately get what they want. They make you doubt even obvious and objective things because they're so sure of themselves, but it's BS. I'm sure even he knew he was wrong, just tried to see if he could get away with it.", "NTA - I had a similar experience several years ago at the movies. I was holding 7 seats, my seat plus 6 more, in a row with 12 seats. My mom and I were there 45 minutes early. I was holding the seats while my mom waited for my brother and nephews to get there. This guy comes in and wants two of the seats I have saved. The theater was otherwise completely empty. Every seat, except for the 7 that I was holding, were available. He was insistent that he wanted two of mine. I\u2019m so thankful that, as he started to sit down, my brother came in and this man suddenly had a change of heart (my brother is a big man and not many challenge him). I don\u2019t like feeling dependent on others, but I was real happy to see him!", "LMAO NTA this entire post was unnecessary", "it depends whether you see it as \"4 people\" or \"a group\"\n\nif its 4 people, grabbing 2 seats is greedy. if its \"a group\" then grabbing the correct number of seats is appropriate, grabbing less would be foolish at best", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
