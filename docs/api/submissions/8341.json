Hes not really close with Cory more of an acquaintance as Abe and Brad are my husbands childhood friends and Cory is a friend Abe and Brad met in college and introduced to my husband. We had an extensive gaming set up in the common area and everyone was open to using it. Most of the gaming systems were bought by either myself or my husband with the exception of one or two bought by Abe. \n\nMy husband and I both separately paid for different streaming platforms which came out to about 4 different ones between the two of us that we had auto-logged in all the systems so everyone could enjoy using them. We had no problems with them the entire time we lived together and didn\u2019t think much of it when we moved out. The past two weeks my husband and I haven\u2019t been able to use it at all (has been giving the blocked/too many users notification from 8am-10pm) and asked the group chat if maybe one of them still had our log in and no one said anything so we thought maybe there was something wrong and changed all the passwords for all the streaming services we pay for. \n\nCory sent a message in the group chat asking what happened to the services as he cant log in anymore and he wanted to use them. My husband said we changed the password and explained why and said he wasn\u2019t going to give the new ones out again and apologized to them as-well stating its nothing personal. Now everyone in the group chat are calling my husband and I AH because we didn\u2019t find a need to change the passwords until now and never had any problems sharing with them in the first place and now none of them can watch the shows they\u2019ve been watching. \n\nI honestly just felt like they\u2019re being huge children about something they never paid for to begin with and have no right to be upset about it but some of them are not in a position where they could pay for one of these services themselves and we just kicked them off randomly AITA?\n\nEdit: we just found out two of them had shared our log in information with their girlfriends/family and they are getting bombarded with messages from them about this. I feel like this is just karma working itself out. \n\nAlso \u201cBrad\u201d has since apologized for leeching off of us and has offered to pay us a portion of the cost is he can continue using it.", "created_utc": 1674750653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lvwad/aita_for_changing_the_pw_on_streaming_services/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
