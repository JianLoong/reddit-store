One on his actual birthday weekend was billed as \"making up for my 21st spent up a mountain in Afghanistan\". The second is a more civilised affair for those who don't want to or can't drink like they're going to jail. We RSVPd to both & last weekend we met at a rented house & had a party to shame Dionysius.\n\nNow I'm one of those annoying people who doesn't really get hangovers, or rather my hangovers manifest as feeling a little thirsty & waking up early. So I woke at 0700 & decided to go for a run, while running I saw a small shop in the village was open so on my return leg I stopped & bought everything you could possibly put in a breakfast.\n\nI got back into the cottage, cleaned up enough to find the kitchen & after making buckets of coffee & tea I fried up a breakfast.\n\nAs the lurching horrors that are hungover 40ish olds appeared & either declared me not human or a Saint the food was consumed & more people appeared.\n\nSo arrived the Vegan, she is the girlfriend of Ed's brother (Mark) I have met her 3 times, I know she is a vegan.\n\nThe Vegan burst into the kitchen & loudly complained that there were no vegan options. I explained that I had purposefully used oil not butter for most things so she could have eggs* wilted/fresh spinach, tomato, mushrooms, fried bread, toast, beans, potato scones. I also said that I had some fruit, a few avocados or I could direct her to the shop it was a few minutes walk away.\n\nShe exploded, she screamed that I'd offered her eggs, that I was a dick for cooking meat when a vegan was on the property, that I might have used the same pans/utensils for a the meat or vegan options. She then crashed out of the kitchen & returned gesturing at me with a milk carton & screeched (I don't use the word lightly) that I hadn't offered her a vegan alternative. \n\nI was trying very hard to keep my cool because I love Ed & like Mark a lot so I took a breath & explained that there was no vegan option in the shop (i hadn't looked tbh). What had she planned on doing if someone else hadn't bought any? She started off but unfortunately my gf burst in at that point, laid into her about giving fellow vegans a bad name & told her to find Mark & gtfo. We found him covered in vomit on the bathroom floor so stuck him in the bath, hosed him down. He woke up, was in no state to drive so he offered to call her a taxi. She left.\n\nEd mentioned it put a sour note at the end of a great night & Mark looked like he was dreading going home. A few friends have since said that if I knew there were vegans I should have at least looked for vegan options.\n\nWhile I think her actions were terrible I do feel like in 2023 maybe I should have considered dietary requirements. \n\n*My gf (Vegan) will eat eggs if they are from pets/home grown, I'll explain more in comments if required", "created_utc": 1695983641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16v814r/aita_for_not_cooking_for_a_vegan/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.", "I have been at least a vegetarian for 36 years (decided as a child) and a vegan off and on for 1/2 that time. I\u2019ve also been beyond-happily married to a eats anything person for 27 years. \n\nYIU DID NOTHING WRONG. You had vegan options in all the veggies and offered that. You probably found her special hangover personality.  I don\u2019t see how you\u2019re supposed to assume she needed alternative milk. If she didn\u2019t request it, you\u2019re left guessing. A vegan diet doesn\u2019t automatically mean mean a person has to have oat drink and impossible meat. I don\u2019t use either product. \n\nHonestly, people like her make people like me look bad. They are vegan for the attention it gets them, and I\u2019d absolutely love for you to show this response to Ed and Mark. Any person who thinks they have a right to impose is worthless in my book. It means nothing that she\u2019s a vegan if she can\u2019t treat a person who did a nice thing with appreciation and grace. \n\nWhat she did is exactly the same thing as complain to the friend that she hated the birthday gift she just opened. You don\u2019t have to like the gift, but you have to be thankful for the gesture.\n\nNTA", "NTA on behalf of all non-lunatic vegans who don't feel as it's anyones responsibility to feed ourselves other than ourselves; sorry about her.", "NTA. There were options. She was being a typical \"I'M A VEGAN!!!!!\" type of person and, quite frankly, should probably do the world a favour and go and jump head-first into an active volcano.", "NTA, you had plenty of vegan friendly breakfast right there, no reason to get upset. If she can't deal with non vegans eating near her then she can just go sit in another room and not bother the rest or the guests.", "NTA  \nYour girlfriend is not a vegan who eats eggs, she is a vegetarian. But anyway, not an asshole, there were some fruit, potato and toast options, and any vegan staying away should be willing to bring their own stuff or do some shopping. You didn't owe anyone at all a breakfast and tried to do a nice thing.", "Wht the hell did she want?   You offered her spinach tomato mushrooms fried bread. (With no animal products used)\n\n YUM.    I would have loved that sounds lovely and thoughtful.  \n\nNTA   definitely ,  and I want a holiday with you as my breakfast chef.", "NTA.  First of all, nobody actually put you in charge of the cooking, it seems. So the fact that you even thought to put together a breakfast already makes you NTA.  Secondly, I don\u2019t understand why you, of all people, were responsible for her dietary restrictions. If she was going away with a large group, I don\u2019t see how anybody but herself was responsible for ensuring she has enough to eat.  For goodness sake, she didn\u2019t even make sure she had nondairy alternatives for her morning tea/coffee.  Leaving that stuff to other people is lazy at best, but at worst, it is ridiculous to the point of almost gaslighting (and it certainly seems like more than eating vegan food, she wants people to blame and whine to). Thirdly, you DID think about her.  I am not vegan, but also not a big meat eater.  The fact that there was enough between the veg, beans, and toast to put together a proper fry up is more than I would expect. \n\nMaybe Ed is just disappointed it turned out that way without blaming you.  Because the only person responsible for putting a damper on things is The Vegan.  And anybody who complains that you should have looked for vegan options - they are welcome to have gone to the store and cooked something up themselves for her.  Short of that, they need to keep quiet.", "NTA. You very graciously made everyone breakfast and offered multiple options for Mark's girlfriend, even cooking with oil instead of butter; it's hardly your fault she's entitled and thinks that no one should be eating animal products around her. If she didn't like what you made, she should've made her own breakfast.", "I think she was taking her bad mood from her drunk boyfriend out on you. And overbearingly so. NTA because she clearly had a wad of options and norvwere you responsible for every person's needs. My daughter can't have dairy. I travel with lactose free milk. My only recommendation going forward is to not offer eggs to any vegans. Some do. Some don't.  I'm not saying you're wrong but it will be one less thing for an overbearing A**hole vegan to be hysterical about.", "NTA it\u2019s not your fault you don\u2019t know much about vegans and offered her eggs and it\u2019s also not your duty to cook for anyone that morning but out of you being kind and considerate of the people who have hangover she is an adult and she should understand that you\u2019re not in any position to cook for her. She could have just made something without causing drama.", "NTA. You didn't own anyone breakfast. It was a nice attention on your part to do so, and she had a few vegan options even if not much (I do believe eggs aren't vegan). \n \nI'm a vegan myself and clearly we are not the majority so I think it is normal that I brought my own things knowing no one else will use it, and not ask the others to buy things just for me.", "NTA but given that you knew she was vegan and you were supplying food form breakfast, would have been thoughtful to look for vegan options.  But she sounds awful and entitled and would have taken it as her due rather than be grateful", "NTA\n\nI'm fully indoctrinated into the good parts of Southern culture- If I'm cooking I want everybody to eat, I want guests in my home to be comfortable and happy, and it genuinely makes me happy when I can work around a food allergy or dietary restriction. \n\nYou did offer her food, there were veggies and other options. A lot of vegans believe that if the eggs are from a backyard/pet chicken (and unfertilized) then they're just a by-product, but if it's grocery store eggs then they want don't want to support those companies- which I think is fair. \n\nYou did everything right, and were in fact much nicer than I would have been if I was getting yelled at while cooking for everyone. If she needed a special vegan breakfast of her own, why didn't she plan ahead or reach out to whoever was in charge of food planning? I think some people like to stir up shit when they can, it feels like she wanted a fight with her SO about how she's not supported or something. \ud83e\udd37", "NTA\n\nThis person is why vegans get a bad wrap.\n\nWould it be nice if you had a completely vegan option, sure. Most vegans don\u2019t eat eggs regardless of where the coke from, but as you said, she could have avocado toast and fruit. Sounds delicious to this non-vegan anyway.", "In no way are you TA. It was an impromptu meal,as a treat. At an event you RSVP\u2019d to not the host of. \n\nIf you were the host, and brought the food for the weekend with no vegan options you WBTA. She\u2019s an adult, if she doesn\u2019t like it, she can lump it.", "NTA it was unplanned and spontaneous. Sounds like there were a few things she could scrounge and a store not too far away.", "Vegan here: offer a hungover me (vodka is vegan)  bread, beans, spinach, shrooms, fruits and avos, throw in some coffee and I'd be a happy herbivore. This vegan you've encountered is no ordinary one. It's either a militant or a spoilt one.\n\nLooking at your comments I wouldn't have touched the spinach as eggs had been on them. But beggars can't be choosers and if I'm hungry and hungover I am capable of begging, so I would have eaten any of the other vegan food without complaint or walked to the store.\n\nBut in all realness OP, no vegan eats eggs so I don't know what your gf is on, but she's in a weird ass community if she endorses eating backyard eggs. Those chickens have been intentionally bred to lay as many eggs as possible, at the expense of their own lifespan. And has she ever wondered what happened to all the roosters? 50% of all chicks born are roosters, yet only one ended up at your friends' house? Kind of a weird coincidence.\n\nI don't give a sh\\*t what people eat, just stop calling yourself vegan if you're gonna half-a\\*\\* it.\n\nYou are NTA though OP.", "NTA, she\u2019s being a baby and you were considerate to make her food in oil. \n\nAlthough your girlfriend is not really vegan if she eats eggs. Vegans don\u2019t eat eggs, and next time if you cook for a vegan don\u2019t make them eggs lol. But you still had plenty of other options for her.", "This hasn't happened so hard it unhappened the things that had", "NTA. Specifically cause they're vegan. I didn't even read most of it I just saw you weren't vegan and cooking and the person who was vegan complained.

When I had surgery for it in December, my tennis team put together a meal train. The instructions were there. The dietary restrictions were there. One friend forgot and left a chicken casserole. It\u2019s 9 months later now and she STILL doesn\u2019t know of her mistake. My husband ate the casserole over the next few days and made me something else for dinner instead. I sent a thank you note as usual, and left it alone. People make mistakes. She could have been struggling that day. It\u2019s not like I ever go hungry, and honestly, hubby loved the casserole, so I figure it\u2019s easier to move on to more important things and not let little things consume our lives. \n\nYou offered veggies-a LOT of them for what you described as a let-me-just-help-everyone-out-breakfast. If I were an overnight guest for that weekend, I would have had protein bars in my bag & I wouldn\u2019t have even needed them. Spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms\u2026YUM!

That's breakfast right there.", "The issue with that is that vegans are against the commodification of animals full stop.

Especially once you start factoring in food miles for egg alternatives and the issues around Vegan Leather.", "I'm not vegan, so not the best person to comment, but I find the issue of clothing a tricky ethical dilemma. Plastics/polyesters obviously mean animals aren't harmed in the production, but then you have to consider the broader environmental impacts man made fibres have vs the animal derived products they're replacing. It's a tricky one for sure.", "Well like I said, not guaranteed to get to you but my breakfast staple is toasted oats and fresh pineapple", "No worries. I just wanted to give my perspective on it. I've been in the vegan community for over two decades and from my experience there is no debate around eating eggs -- unless we are talking about someone living in poverty in a developing country or something like that, that wants to be vegan but doesn't really have access to enough healthy plant-based foods.", "I\u2019m veggie, kind of leaning toward vegan in terms of diet (I know there\u2019s a whole thing between vegan Vs plant based) - vegan leather is just plastic and nowhere near as good in terms of quality etc.\n\nI buy leather goods second-hand - I get to give the items a new lease of life while not contributing to an industry I have complicated feelings about.", "I have a lot of feelings about how much plastic and other synthetics go into making vegan alternatives and the wider environmental picture. I feel the same way about soya and almond milk vs more sustainable like oat"]}
