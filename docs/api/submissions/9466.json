We share expenses equally but since I make more than her (I make 140K and her 100K) we agreed that she would handle meals and indoor cleaning and most of my daughter's needs. She still does give me grocery lists and I do the shopping and handle outside work like trash, snow, lawn care. She also works from home with a flexible schedule and I have a more demanding 9-5 office job.\n\nMy wife is an excellent cook and she has always made great food for us for which I am really grateful, we lived together for many years and got married about 2 years ago. It has been great and overall still us but since we got married she has started neglecting her part of the deal, she cleans less often which I do not really mind since we have a robot vacuum and she used to clean too much before anyway so I did not comment on that. But she has also started cooking much later and when I get home I find her relaxing instead, on weekdays her meals have gradually become more simple (like stir fried veggies and rapidly made meat or a sandwich). To be clear it is not like she is constantly doing chores, she always has some Netflix time after she puts my daughter to bed.\n\nI brought this up gently and did not really accuse her or tell her to do differently, but did suggest that I liked her pre marriage meals better and said that I still do the same amount of my chores like taking the cars for service, and taking out the trash and made a joke about weaponized incompetence. She did not take this very kindly and has been acting cold but did make much nicer meals again this week. I think I am NTA since I just expressed disappointment without telling her to do anything differently. I also told her I really liked what she made last weekend.\n\nMore than the food, I think what bothered me was the fact that the change happened once we got married, so it felt like she was taking things for granted now that we tied the knot.\n\nEDIT: Ok I see many responses mention our daughter and I agree that is a huge change I did not really consider. I also want to mention I do help with our daughter when I get back home, take her for walks and play etc but I know my wife does a lot, it is just that she never discussed wanting to do less and in the past claimed that she enjoyed doing the cooking and house work. I will discuss about potentially hiring help and try to pick up more of the daily tasks if she agrees.

Oh wait, that probably includes a 1 hour lunch, so 7 hours a day.\n\nShit maybe if he actually tries at work he can make enough more than his wife to crow about it.", "How many times have you shovelled a driveway?", "She is particular and proactive and wanted this arrangement as she loves cooking, but I realize that I did not consider things are different now we have a daughter and she never expressed it. But it is a good wake up call, I will step up more.", "Either this guy is a very bored troll, or he's a terrible husband and I hope his wife divorces him. No in between.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Also, terrible father who does no parenting unless his toddler demands it. WTF.", "Hiring help with your money right? Since she is already paying more then her share. also you say she chose this because of the cooking but what were her choices? How did she end up with all the indoor cleaning. You expect people to believe she came up to you and said \u201choney, I know I make less than you but let\u2019s split everything equally so that I have less disposable income but still do 99% of the labour\u201d.", "Suggest the change yourself, homie. That's you taking care of her and seeing an imbalance that could help her and therefore your relationship. When you love someone do this without holding it over them. Step in and step up.", "Yes, it\u2019s shocking this was ever a deal that was agreed upon to begin with, did he have a girlfriend/wife or a slave?", "Yes. You accused her of faking incompetence and complained that she\u2019s doing less for you when likely she\u2019s exhausted and burnt out by working full time AND caring for another human full time AND making elaborate meals AND cleaning the house. While you sometimes take walks or play with your daughter\u2026", "It\u2019s not \u2018helping out\u2019 when it\u2019s your own kid, it\u2019s parenting. You\u2019ve clearly not been doing it.", "MAYBE? She's your kid. That shouldn't be a maybe.", "Do you actually think just playing with your daughter is a serious contribution to parenting here?", "I see -- so you're doing the fun parts of parenting. Do you feed your daughter or cook her meals? Do you grocery shop for her food? Do you know her likes, dislikes, and allergies? Do you do bathtime? Do you do bedtime? Do you do the morning routine? Do you keep track of what shots she needs and when her doctor's appointments are? Do you change diapers? Did you help with potty training or do you plan to? Do you clean up toys? Do you clean up food messes? Do you clean up puke and pee and every other fluid that comes out of a child? Do you get up in the middle of the night when she's crying or sick? Do you know her clothing size and when to anticipate she might need new clothes because she's growing? Are you involved in discipline when needed?\n\nParenting is way more than strolls and playing. Lots of room for growth here.", "You shouldn't be \"helping\" - you should take on an equal share of the responsibilities. She is your child too, after all.", "But really, what are your chores? What do you do for your family? I see snow removal, weekly shopping and cutting grass in the spring/summer/fall. \n\n\nSo while she is handling the toddler, cooking, cleaning, laundry, what are you doing?", "You're a father.  You should be doing more than taking her for strollers and playing with her when she wants attention.   This isn't the 1950's but you have a 1950's mindset of the wife should do everything indoors including the childcare.  Except this isn't the 1950's.  And your wife has a job.  And is pregnant which is very tiring.", "So you do the fun dad stuff and leave your wife to do the actual work involved in raising a toddler?", "You\u2019re not helping. She\u2019s your kid. It\u2019s literally your job to parent.", "So out of curiosity\u2026 was this post for real? Like my guy, I don\u2019t get how you wouldn\u2019t immediately know YTA. \n\nIf I may also ask, are you a religious couple? Kinda shocked she\u2019s been dealing with a full time job and raising a daughter AND being told she\u2019s not doing enough. I\u2019m doing a PhD and working full time and cannot function and have jumped into therapy to cope. Your wife might need someone to talk to and maybe it\u2019s time to discuss getting a Nanny to help out.", "YTA - and your replies aren't helping you at all.", "So you get to do the fun things with your daughter while she gets to do all the daily chores.\n\nHow the heck can you think that this is even remotely fair?\n\nFor the next couple of months you should let your wife do all the playing and going for walks while you clean up the mess your child makes during the day.", "I don't understand why both of your salaries are even in this equation. Mine and my husband's salaries do not even equal your wife's and we still take it upon ourselves to do things around the house if the other isn't able to because of our 4 month old or jobs. If I don't get time to sweep and mop the kitchen, my husband does it. If he doesn't get a chance to clean the bathroom, I'll do it. \n\nYou doing the fun bits is not fair on your wife. She is raising a 2 year old and working full time. So what if it's from home or it's flexible. SHE IS ACTUALLY DOING 2 JOBS RATHER THAN YOUR 1.\n\nYTA", "does it occur to you that when you take the kid for a jaunty stroll, that's the only moment of a break your wife gets all day? you don't say anything about childcare during the day, which means she is providing full time childcare while working a full time job. she is doing 80 hours of work in 40 hours. but you take the kid for walks so you're right father of the year.", "So the fun stuff and not the actual parenting, got it. YTA.", "Do you even parent your child?", "I don\u2019t think you have a clue on how demanding a 2 year old is. It is extremely tiring chasing after them. Perhaps, if possible, switch responsibilities for a week.  I\u2019m not going to call you an AH, but I feel you are more clueless about her reality.  You have it easier by far!", "Who cares if you go to the office or not? Who cares if you make $40k or more than her?  Marriage is all about compromise.  Your end of the deal is ridiculous.  Pick up some of the slack and give her a break.", "Stop taking her for granted. Do you know how much it would cost to hire a maid, chef, and nanny? On top of that, she\u2019s also working.", "You are taking her for granted - chores should NEVER be based on who earns more money.", "You keep bringing up that she works from home. That doesn't mean she works less than if she went in to the office.", "its weird that you joke about weaponized incompetence when what you are doing is literally that.", "Okay and? That means you can\u2019t help with your own kid when you get home? You can\u2019t offer to cook dinner a couple nights?", "And cooking you dinner? And taking care of your daughter?", "Running a load of laundry during the workday is easy, putting it all away is a big task which you should be helping with.", "I am so sick of cooking, I insist on easy meals once in a while. Heck even when we do take out I\u2019m the one that goes out and gets it (I do not trust strangers to deliver my food without tampering with it). Cooking is a big deal, never mind working a full time job while caring for a child AND cleaning, that\u2019s crazy expectations.", "Yes, shes probably just not wanting to nag for help. I hate having to ask my husband to change a diaper or start bath time bc its a double standard (you think hes ever asked me that question). Just be proactive. You are a team, offer to help. 2 year olds are so so hard. Im 9 months pregnant and was laying down, my 2 year old takes off her pants and brings me her diaper. I look down and realized her turds had fallen onto our rug (hence, why the diaper was removed). Thats just one of a dozen exhausting things on the daily with a toddler. It makes me happy that you seem to understand this now.", "But back to the issue - the division of household responsibility should not be based on income. You should both have the same amount of free time. Anything else is taking away your wife's free time from her so that you can have more, which is extremely selfish.", "Even without factoring in your daughter, how is an annual car service, mowing the lawn every couple of weeks, taking out the trash, and \u201csnow\u201d (how much does it snow where you are?) compare to three meals a day plus cleaning? \n\nSwap tasks for a week. See if you complain then.", "I do more than that, sometimes when she demands things and my wife is busy, I keep her calm. but I could definitely do more.", "I help with potty training, and I do bath and bed time sometimes but admittedly less than my wife does.\n\nAnd I do take her to appointments and also help with feeding her. The feeding I do a lot.", "We can certainly discuss reducing her burden or hiring help and I know that she does more in terms of daily tasks, as mine are more heavy labor but seasonal tasks. She just never brought it up and earlier claimed that she liked the arrangement, but it is true that now we have a daughter.", "We could hire one of those to help her out if her load is too much, that is a good idea.", "I could help more I guess, I might have to learn for cooking but I can try. I do help out with my daughter once I get home, I play with her and take her out on walks.", "You mean when your wife is drowning in 100% of the housework and cooking and parenting you do something with YOUR KID, but only when the kid demands it? Of course you could do more - you could hardly do less!", "Yeah\u2026childcare is a fulltime job. Try it on your own for a week and see if you can better understand the breakdown of labor here", "Heavy labor, are you kidding me? You take out the trash once a week and mow the lawn a dozen times a year? Your wife does 95% of the chores and you are complaining? I\u2019m a SAHM and I do pretty much 100% of household stuff, indoors and out. The outdoor stuff is nothing. Hell, it\u2019s sometimes fun to get out there and mow the lawn or clear our freakishly long driveway of the snow. It\u2019s the daily laundry and cooking and cleaning that is the stuff of Sisyphus. God damn you\u2019re annoying.\n\nI hope this isn\u2019t real, but on the off chance it is, you\u2019re a huge asshole and a sucky partner. YTA.", "Boo hoo, heavy labor?  Let's see; she is the one who gave birth and does most of the work.  Let's talk about mental load.", "Help her out?\u2026 man that\u2019s helping YOU out. It helps the family, it helps you. That\u2019s your home and your children and YOU are responsible for half of that work.", "Or her husband could stop being lazy", "THAT is weaponized incompetence.", ">I might have to learn for cooking but I can try\n\nThis is *actual* weaponized incompetence.  You are projecting hard.", "You don\u2019t know how to cook as a grown ass man but you\u2019re accusing your wife of weaponized incompetence because her exhausted, overworked self isn\u2019t making fancy meals for you anymore? That\u2019s rich.", "Do you think your wife was born knowing how to cook? That she just magically obtained her skills through osmosis? She learned and so can you.", "You play with her and take her on walks\u2026 What is she a dog? I wonder who changed her diapers\u2026", "You literally can't cook, and all you do with your daughter is play and take her out on walks.\n\nAlso lol at \"a more demanding 9-5 office job,\" as though anything you do at that office for a mere 8 hours a day compares to the shitshow your wife has to deal with on a daily basis. \n\nShut up and eat your \"simple meat.\" Maybe do more than just yardwork once a week or two.", "I also do home repair, snow removal, painting, pressure washing etc.", "Thank you! This is honestly the real truth!", "Yeah the projection is *strong* with this one.\n\nYTA", "I can cook ironically simpler meals, but I would be willing to look up on the internet and learn, I always wanted to be better at cooking.", "Of course, and I do know how to cook, just ironically more simpler meals. But I would not mind learning and there is lots of info on the web to learn.", "So do I. I paint, do light electrical, woodworking, etc. That shit is easy and not every day. Try harder.", "Honestly, youre giving me stereotypical gendered division of labor.\n\nIts 2023 - being a man doesnt mean you get a pass on certain chores. Talk to your wife and make sure she feels supported and step up where you can.", ">ironically simpler meals\n\n\u2026like the ones your wife was cooking because she\u2019s exhausted from parenting a 2 year old but still wanted to make sure her family was fed? Those meals, that it sure sounds like you could make yourself?", "Okay so what's stopping you??", "So get to learning and give your wife a break.", "I do understand and recognize she does more than me. She wanted it that way and earlier in our relationship I asked her about it and she said she liked it. She never brought up wanting to change it. \n\nBut I agree it should have been obvious that I should have inquired again now that we have a child.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to inquire. Just freaking do some chores. It\u2019s not done, cool just do it. It\u2019s your house too. You aren\u2019t helping her. You\u2019re doing the bare minimum in helping clean up the house."]}
