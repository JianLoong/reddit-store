Your family has put themselves out to take care of her while already not getting any appreciation (it sounds like, anyways)- now she's suddenly wanting to make a change, which is probably your uncle in her ear.\n\nSounds like out of duty, you make sure she has someone, but if she's going to continue to push you to the sidelines and not think about how YOU will be the person bearing the burden of organizing her funeral and dealing with her estate, after also having taken care of her, I would be fed tf up as well. If your uncle wants her little bit of money, he can drive her to appointments and house her and feed and and be the unappreciated one.\n\nI would be blunt with her. Mom, we love you and we want to make sure you are taken care of, wife has been helping all she can, I am helping, you know I will make sure you are buried properly and your affairs handled, I'm hurt that you'd decide after all that to change your beneficiary to \\*mystery person/uncle\\*  (you can even ask her why she's doing that NOW) when so-and-so doesn't seem to take any interest in making sure you are okay right now while your alive. We just can't continue to overextend ourselves when it just doesn't seem you appreciate the strain this places on us, this makes me feel unappreciated - not because of the money which would only do A-B-C anyways, but because we've shown you we have your best interests at heart and have plans to make sure everything is taken care of when you pass.", "NTA I would let her know that who ever she makes the beneficiary will be the one to plan & pay for her funeral.

Ask what kind of funeral she wants and how it will be covered. Ask who will handle the estate or how she expects you to manage the time you\u2019d need off work.

So i would say things are muddy, and just acceptung tgat it is muddy and have it be done might be one way to go. Especially that when it gets about the will, emotions rise high in nearly every family, even ones that work well. For many fmaily members, the will is symbolic and a form of validation.
