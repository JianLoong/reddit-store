Basketball shorts are long and flowing, she was wearing a tank top and bra. Nothing about her outfit was inappropriate for the home or deserved shaming. \n\nHe escalated and made comments about her body when no one else in the household did. He's allowed to not want to be alone with her if he personally feels like her outfit is too sexy and giving him inappropriate thoughts, but the conversation should have ended after her \"dude, it's just skin\" comment. He chose to continue making comments which were clearly inappropriate based on her reaction. It's understandable for a young woman to be upset at being shamed by an older (formerly) trusted male relative. I'm guessing that he had previously never seen her as a \"girl\" and this outfit for some reason triggered him in a sexual nature and he felt guilty for it and took it out on her. It's not her fault he's viewing her sexually regardless of what she's wearing, but especially if she's wearing an outfit that I see teenagers wearing all the time (although it's often Lulu's instead of basketball shorts, so much more revealing), an outfit that no other grown person in that house felt was inappropriate. \n\nOp was an AH for expressing his opinions about her clothing beyond simply stating why he left the situation.", "They didn\u2019t tell them to cover up, they walked out the room without saying anything and where asked why and simply voiced their own personal discomfort rather than tell them to coverup.\n\nPeople are allowed to be uncomfortable.", "But then he escalated.

Especially when he went to leave in silence. Yeah, it is. Maybe you should look in a mirror and stop being an ah", "No, he went to leave. Is he supposed to lie when she asked what\u2019s wrong??\n\nSo you can backlash at him for being a liar too? Manipulative and an ah, wow\n\nAnd yeah, my mother has been removed from my life for over 2 decades. If I don\u2019t want to see it, I\u2019ll do anything to not see it.

Lie is a lie!\n\nJust because someone isn\u2019t comfortable around another or how they dress doesn\u2019t mean they have inappropriate thought! I guess as a straight female I have them about my own mother? Yeah again, that logic is invalid. It\u2019s not logical at all.

You all are trying to say it\u2019s okay to show skin even if someone is uncomfortable.\n\nIf you can\u2019t see how wrong it is, then everyone else is the ah. For simply expecting others to be okay with it\u2026that\u2019s an ah. Even I would have left (and in a female) and would have answered the same.

Again, ah much?", "Then she should never have asked!", "please don't pretend that wearing a tank top and basketball shorts in your own room is the same as a nude beach. besides that, a nude beach is a public place, her bedroom was not. and in your own example, someone is allowed to be uncomfortable going there, so they dont go. you can't go to a nude beach and then shame people for being naked because it makes you uncomfortable \n\nIf he knows he's that prone to hypersexualizing teens, he should stay out of their bedrooms", "He went into her room and then got uncomfortable because of what she was wearing in her own personal space. This isn't someone going to a nude beach and being upset that they're where nude folks walking around. \n\nHe clearly had set expectations on what she should have to wear and got upset when she was wearing different clothes.

This whole situation just reeks of misogyny.", "As he did!", "No, people should NOt be just okay seeing whatever, that\u2019s a controlling a hole.

I mean, look how he doubled down on his incredibly offensive behaviour.  \n\n\"However, she was apparently feeling fine enough to remain dressed in her *offending* tank top and shorts.\"\n\nHe's clearly not mature enough to realize where he went wrong and why he felt so offended.  I mean, how dare a woman show her body if he isn't allowed to have it.  And somewhere deep in this twisted psyche, he knows it's wrong to lust after your cousin.  So he has to blame her for making him have those vile evil thoughts.\n\nIf I were the poor cousin, there wouldn't be any apologies because I'd never allow this piece of semi-sentient mobile slime in my presence again.", "Tell me you think your cousin is hot without telling me you think your cousin is hot.", "They where not afraid to show skin in the 1920s.

It's all they know and even the thought of acting counter to that is enough to make a lot of people uncomfortable.  OP is definitely the AH in this situation but his prudish behavior is likely the result of some degree of cultural upbringing and breaking out of that is not nearly as easy as you may think.", "Which makes him an AH.

A grown male relative coming into the bedroom space of a still-teenage cousin where she was relaxing alone and then telling her to cover up because seeing her fully dressed body is too much for him.
