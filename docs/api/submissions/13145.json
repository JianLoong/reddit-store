He's allowed to not want to be alone with her if he personally feels like her outfit is too sexy and giving him inappropriate thoughts, but the conversation should have ended after her \"dude, it's just skin\" comment. He chose to continue making comments which were clearly inappropriate based on her reaction. It's understandable for a young woman to be upset at being shamed by an older (formerly) trusted male relative. I'm guessing that he had previously never seen her as a \"girl\" and this outfit for some reason triggered him in a sexual nature and he felt guilty for it and took it out on her. It's not her fault he's viewing her sexually regardless of what she's wearing, but especially if she's wearing an outfit that I see teenagers wearing all the time (although it's often Lulu's instead of basketball shorts, so much more revealing), an outfit that no other grown person in that house felt was inappropriate. \n\nOp was an AH for expressing his opinions about her clothing beyond simply stating why he left the situation.", "They didn\u2019t tell them to cover up, they walked out the room without saying anything and where asked why and simply voiced their own personal discomfort rather than tell them to coverup.\n\nPeople are allowed to be uncomfortable.", "But then he escalated.

She asked a question\u2026and yet he\u2019s wrong for being honest? \n\nYou don\u2019t get to say it\u2019s disrespectful but also you should lie \u2026 \n\nIf he\u2019s not allowed to feel how he does, then how is anyone else allowed to?", "Dense because I can think logically?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s controlling for her to ask a question and then get upset by his answer because it hurt her feelings. Especially when he went to leave in silence. Yeah, it is. Maybe you should look in a mirror and stop being an ah", "No, he went to leave. Is he supposed to lie when she asked what\u2019s wrong??\n\nSo you can backlash at him for being a liar too? Manipulative and an ah, wow\n\nAnd yeah, my mother has been removed from my life for over 2 decades. If I don\u2019t want to see it, I\u2019ll do anything to not see it. It\u2019s my right just as much as everybody else\u2019s. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to tell someone they must be okay with anything. That\u2019s an absolute ah.", "Personally, I don\u2019t think either should go topless. If a woman can\u2019t then neither should a man.\nI\u2019ve left people\u2019s homes because of they were dressed. I or anyone should have a right to leave if we do t want to see.\n\nBut someone asks a question, telling someone to lie or ignore is also an ah move. Either they want honesty or they do not. If you don\u2019t want honesty, don\u2019t ask. She shouldn\u2019t have asked if she\u2019s only looking for certain responses", "I don\u2019t have temptation, I just don\u2019t want to see it! Is there something wrong with someone making that choice?\nAnd no, just because You are okay with white lies doesn\u2019t mean everyone is. Lie is a lie!\n\nJust because someone isn\u2019t comfortable around another or how they dress doesn\u2019t mean they have inappropriate thought! I guess as a straight female I have them about my own mother? Yeah again, that logic is invalid. It\u2019s not logical at all. You\u2019re just trying to slap something negative into someone\u2019s choices that hurts your feelings", "Lmao I wish I\u2019m a female who understands no one has a right to get mad that someone doesn\u2019t like what they wear. He has a right to feel how he does.\n\nShe does not have a right to get mad he answered honestly. Tell me you want to manipulate without telling me. You all are trying to say it\u2019s okay to show skin even if someone is uncomfortable.\n\nIf you can\u2019t see how wrong it is, then everyone else is the ah. For simply expecting others to be okay with it\u2026that\u2019s an ah. Even I would have left (and in a female) and would have answered the same. And then when she got up said would have said \u201cwhy would you ask a question if you didn\u2019t want the honest answer?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you upset by what I wear?\u201d Uh because it\u2019s each to their own beliefs and feelings. Why are you bothered someone doesn\u2019t like what you wear? Again, ah much?", "Then she should never have asked!", "please don't pretend that wearing a tank top and basketball shorts in your own room is the same as a nude beach. besides that, a nude beach is a public place, her bedroom was not. and in your own example, someone is allowed to be uncomfortable going there, so they dont go. you can't go to a nude beach and then shame people for being naked because it makes you uncomfortable \n\nIf he knows he's that prone to hypersexualizing teens, he should stay out of their bedrooms", "He went into her room and then got uncomfortable because of what she was wearing in her own personal space. This isn't someone going to a nude beach and being upset that they're where nude folks walking around. \n\nHe clearly had set expectations on what she should have to wear and got upset when she was wearing different clothes. Then he put that on her by explicitly telling her that she wasn't wearing enough clothes. He is showing his disapproval. He got uncomfortable because in one way or another he was sexualising his cousin.", "Who is saying he\u2019s not allowed to be uncomfortable or remove himself? Not one person. His response to that discomfort makes him the AH.", "Because he went to leave and said nothing. She asked a question and got mad at his honest response. \n\nOtherwise, if he lied and she found out, ThAT would held against him too, putting him in a no win unless he just accepts and keeps his feelings silent. That\u2019s manipulation. You don\u2019t get to get mad at your own question answered just because it\u2019s not what you want to hear.", "And how do you think she would have taken it? So ignoring or straight up not answering is better?? How does that logic work? Just because it saved her feelings??? What an ah response", "That wording still blames her. \n\nHe needs to apologize and put it squarely on himself: I felt uncomfortable when I saw what you were wearing because I have more conservative ideas about clothing. I wasn't going to say anything until you called me back because it's not my place to judge.", "I wasn't suggesting you are a muslim but calling out your absurd mysogyny and tight arse beliefs when it comes to womens bodies, much like the taliban.\n\nI have no idea why you are talking about Americans and their gutters, that is just strange.", "You think you're scoring points with this?", "Oh I bet. This whole situation just reeks of misogyny.", "As he did!", "No, people should NOt be just okay seeing whatever, that\u2019s a controlling a hole. It\u2019s each individual rights to how they wish to feel, and no one said it was okay to sexualize, that\u2019s what victim mentality does\u2026just like my mother\u2026.wanted to complain about people hitting on her but would never cover up.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to get mad at others feelings , especially when they try to get away, and you don\u2019t get to get mad when someone answers honestly.\nAh through and through", "People are allowed to feel and think whatever they want. It's when he tried to make it her problem by telling her he could see too much skin. *And then things escalated from there.* I'd like to know specifically what else he said. \n\nYou don't need to tell people these things, particularly a 27 year old to a 19 yr old cousin. It's entitled, clueless, and gross.", "Are you kidding me? \n\n>She asked me what was wrong, so I came back inside, and discreetly told her that I could see too much skin. She looked at me, visibly weirded out, and told me \"dude, it's just skin\". **I replied back to her, and things escalated a bit mildly.**\n\nBolding mine. \n\nHe clearly told her something he didn't want to admit. I'm guessing it was telling her to cover up, berating her or sult shaming her. Could always be D all of the above too.", ">She asked me what was wrong, so I came back inside, and discreetly told her that I could see too much skin. She looked at me, visibly weirded out, and told me \"dude, it's just skin\". I replied back to her, and things escalated a bit mildly. I ended up simply leaving her room,\n\nDid you skip over this part? OP is leaving stuff out.", "This was my take. He tried to avoid exactly what happened. She asked he communicated. He probably should have left right after that. But he did try to avoid this entire encounter.", "The cousin wasn\u2019t naked though. OP is uncomfortable she has a woman\u2019s body that wasn\u2019t all covered up", "Lol no, I\u2019ll take a glance and then continue on with the convo. I\u2019m not staring at their breasts or ass or stomach or anything.", "Being tactful is a thing ya know", "quit pretending to be a woman on the internet and get a life lol good lord", "she didnt ask a question? her cousin just came in and started berating her because HE was the one uncomfortable that his dick got hard looking at his cousin. thats his problem. he doesn\u2019t get to tell her to cover up because he can\u2019t control himself. she is allowed to have feelings. she is allowed to be upset about her cousin sexualising her. why when women have emotions its seen as \u201ccontrolling\u201d or \u201cmanipulative\u201d to you? you are exhibiting classic mysogonist values. if you don\u2019t want to be a mysogonist, consider not calling emotional women \u201ccontrolling\u201d", "Easy, you simply say: \u201cI have conservative views on clothes and it makes me uncomfortable but not my place to judge\u201d. It\u2019s entirely his problem, trying to make it hers is cringe and more than a little pathetic tbh. It\u2019s quite easy to be polite about those kind of irrational views. \n\nBut no, like many others like him he makes it her problem and goes so far as to give her a lecture about his unjustified opinion, again, in her own space, which in and of itself is extremely disrespectful. \n\nGood for you? I don\u2019t really care about your personal life tbh. \n\nI have every right to expect someone to speak to me with a certain level of civility and respect, more so in my own house or room, regardless of what I am wearing. As I said; for me I would delete this person from my life and not look back.", "Nope. That\u2019s where tact comes in. He blamed her for making him uncomfortable and said she was wrong for it. Nobody\u2019s saying he should have stayed in the room or lied to her. It\u2019s what he said that is the problem, not how he felt or that he left. (Although that\u2019s the underlying problem and one he should certainly work on in therapy.)", "god you're like the person who knocked on my door and then got upset at me for not having a shirt on. Fuck right on off.", "He can make the choice. Meaning he can fuck off somewhere cuz it is his problem. \n\nYeah...I'm saying he should lie vs making someone else uncomfortable. or tell them what rhey can and can't wear. It ain't like she was naked. In OPs story NO ONE ELSE MAKES A FUSS ABOUT WHAT HIS COUSIN IS WEARING. So this is really just a him problem. He can go biblical and pluck his offending eye out if it's that much of a problem for him.", "I take it you never go to a swimming pool either then?", ">You all are trying to say it\u2019s okay to show skin even if someone is uncomfortable.\n\nBut it IS OK. No one has to enjoy the way a person dresses, but no one has the right to expect them to change. A tank top and shorts is a normal outfit to wear in a home. I'm a slightly chubbier than average woman with large breasts. I'm sure plenty of people don't enjoy the sight of my bare flabby arms and cleavage in hot weather, but they don't get to tell me to cover up and suffer the heat just because I'm not visually appealing.", "Ah yes, you're a \"female\" \n\nYou seem to be arguing with everyone in these comments. I agree that removing himself was the best solution. He should have stayed away afterward, though. Far away. \n\nIt's strange to enter someone's room and leave without a word while they're in there, so her question wasn't out of line. And yes, she is allowed to get upset about the answer. She didn't complain to everyone around her. She kept it to herself. But why is she obligated to stick around with a creep who sexualizes her? How is that an asshole move? \n\nShe isn't telling him to think differently. She's removing HERSELF from the equation. Or does she not have the same rights as OP does? \n\nFor the record, I'm a woman who dresses pretty modestly. If you, a female, want to be judgemental about the way other people dress, especially in their own home, then I would avoid you too.", "She asked because her cousin was already acting like a huge creep and that\u2019s a natural human response. \n\nHe should have known the problem was his and his alone and kept it to himself. Could have easily said something to brush it off and take his leave, but instead he decided to shame his cousin due to HIS fucked up feelings.", "Right, ball shorts and a tank top are pretty standard to see in public.  Crop tops are the latest fashion.  Does OP just wear blinders as to not be affected by him sexualizing anyone showing what he deems too much skin?  If his 19 year old male cousin was in the same style attire, would he say the same about showing too much skin in their bedroom that he walked into.", "He says himself it escalated AFTER he answered her question, and she replied \"it's just skin\". She asked, he answered, she replied - and THEN more was said. He should have just walked away before arguing.", "She probably would\u2019ve taken, \u201coh it\u2019s nothing, no worries,\u201d a lot better than \u201cCOVER THY SKIN, HARLOT!\u201d You may be shocked to know that, while everyone has the right to feel what they feel, their feelings aren\u2019t always right and definitely don\u2019t need to be vocalized.", "All I said applies to women and men equally, I wear booty shorts and tank tops too, and I would've had the same type of comments from my siblings if I had gone to a family reunion dressed that way. American or European gutters, both of them bask in the same waters of depravity.", "Having some fun at least <3", "Exactly it\u2019s actually ridiculous.\n\nPeople are literally saying that if you feel uncomfortable that means you are some creepy pervert for not being okay with it?\n\nAs long as you\u2019re not forcing your view on someone else then I don\u2019t see why it is so bad to be uncomfortable?\n\nPeople have different levels of comfort and it\u2019s really ridiculous that we are getting to a stage that communicating a boundary or view in a non offensive manner will get people so offended and riled up to call that person a creepy sexualising pervert.", "Naked or not, I still noticed how people look. If people just looked at each other in the face then the fashion industry would be worth marginally less and we could all just wear grey sacks for existence. \n\nLike I said, he it\u2019s okay for him to be uncomfortable especially in regards to a family member. \n\nSome people grow up with different levels of comfort with dress in their family and as a result view things differently.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re not forcing it on someone else we should label someone a pervert because they see their cousin in a bra and it makes them uncomfortable. \n\nI personally couldn\u2019t give a shit myself, but if a person has a different level of comfort and isn\u2018t forcing it down anyone else throat then who cares?", "Not if it includes lying", "Lmao, go ahead and believe what you want to make yourself feel better", "As would I! I\u2019ve removed my own family because they think I have to be okay with how they dress. If I don\u2019t want to see it, I\u2019ll find a way to not see it, even removing myself. But how many are going to blow up about that too? Many. Because they can\u2019t stand their feelings to be hurt or someone to feel differently. I\u2019d cut you out in a heartbeat too", "Telling someone to lie is an ah move. No, no one should ever lie. Don\u2019t ask a question if you don\u2019t want honest response! Only manipulators say to lie", "Then she should not have asked! You don\u2019t a question and then complain about the answer, especially if it\u2019s honest.", "Glad I didn't grow up anywhere near either of them then.\n\nSorry you hate yourself so much and can't even wear normal clothes around your family without feeling like trash, sounds like hell.", "Exactly!!", "ok bro lol", "You also don\u2019t barge into someone\u2019s private bedroom unannounced and then scoff at them for what they\u2019re wearing. He clearly let his body language and facial expression give him away, CAUSING her to ask the question.\n\nYou fail to see he\u2019s the one that started the whole thing, not her. He\u2019s the AH through and through.", "Lady dude lol"]}
