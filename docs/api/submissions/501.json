Woman 1 starts watching videos on her phone on full volume. There\u2019s yelling, horn honking, snippets of music. Extremely annoying and definitely does not mesh well with the classical music the salon is already playing. I\u2019m trying to keep my cool but I have some sensory disorders and hearing two sets of music at the same time really sets me off and can send me into an anxiety attack. \n\nAfter another five minutes of this I\u2019m visibly distressed to the point the nail lady asks me if I\u2019m okay. I tell her that I it\u2019s very disturbing and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate that somebody is watching videos out loud in a public space and ask her if she could ask the woman to stop. The nail lady either misunderstood me or disregarded me but did ask the woman to turn it down. \n\nWoman 1 turned it to about half the volume but not even ten minutes later her friend starts watching her own set of videos out loud on her phone. So now we have the classical music from the nail salon and not one, but two phones blasting god knows what. At this point it was clear the employees weren\u2019t going to do anything so I opened Spotify and started playing Cannibal Corpse on my phone at full volume. \n\nAfter about 30 seconds of this the woman doing my nails looked very perturbed and asked me to please turn it off. I told her if those two women could listen to music/videos on their phones then why couldn\u2019t I? At that point the employees told the two women and me that we all needed to turn our volume off. It was dead quiet after that and the tension in their was so thick you could cut it with a knife. My manicure finished quickly so I paid and left. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why people think it\u2019s okay to use their phone speaker in public spaces. Like do they think we all wear headphones for fun?? In no situation do I or anybody else want to listen to your Tik Tok videos or your child\u2019s iPad games. How are people this inconsiderate? And I also don\u2019t understand why businesses permit this, especially those offering \u201cspa services.\u201d I go get my nails done to relax not have sensory overload. \n\nSo am I the asshole for playing Cannibal Corpse to get my point across?", "created_utc": 1667090209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh016b/aita_for_playing_death_metal_at_a_nail_salon/", "score": 481, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're being willfully ignorant if you say anything anything dispute that. Second, If the employee saw no problem with it you should've stuck some headphones on and ignored it. At that point it is not your decision to make and she only got involved because of your immature temper tantrum. Do you work there? No? Okay. Take your business somewhere else or do you nails at home. If you have \"sensory issues\" you should have called ahead to see if they could accommodate you.

Outside of a few elite circles, no one buys them - they just play music at full volume because it's free. Public transportation is a nightmare because everyone just blasts their phones without earbuds as a result of the money grab Apple and Samsung are doing. \n\nI actually like your solution.
