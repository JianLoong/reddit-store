If she had \"very severe\" OCD, many in the school would have noticed. This sounds much more like a fake/self/parental diagnosis.

Not in the sense that is typically meant. So you were correct that she was not sick. \n\nSecond, you can't accommodate a disability you haven't been told about and don't know the student has. You're not a mind reader. Kids can't just show up on the day of a test and say \"oh I have a problem.\" Lol no. That would get abused so so fast. \n\nSome kids will do anything to get out of class.

They don't always succeed. But you can't just hand out accommodations to some kids and not others without an IEP (or equivalent in place). That's not fair to everyone else.\n\nThird: I have a kid with OCD.

But still, this behavior was obvious, something he did every day--and this was him being calm and collected, not spiking. \n\nSo I have my armchair internet rando-style doubts about this diagnosis.

So I say yes, that is somewhat on you.   \n\n\nHOWEVER, the rest is on her  parents, who should have made her diagnosis known to the school and asked for this exemption before that specific day, as neither you, nor any other teacher she will ever have, are psychics, it is now the end of February, and presumably, since you have history with this student (since you reference seeing her previously) so it was not her first day of school or anything, and nobody was made aware of her illness which is not apparent most of the time, it seems, going on the information you provided.   \n\n\nAs such, ultimately, NTA, but I do think you should keep in mind that not all people who are sick \\*look\\* sick, and in fact, appear perfectly healthy a good lot of the time, despite being sick.

I understand this student had things going on that they didn't tell you about and their OCD symptoms made them feel unwell but they didn't express that to you and you also didn't ask further. By grade 11 though I feel a student should be able to advocate a bit more for themselves. \n\nI had a grade 9 student write a make up test after being away a week and then after the test she tells me she has a concussion.. I had no clue, I wouldn't have made her write the test if I knew that but no parent contacted me and I emailed home that she missed the test, no reply received. Admin told me until after I emailed them about it and then they said oh yea we have medical documentation about the concussion.

If, say, the school isn't within walking distance from the kid's house, the kids parents were at work and couldn't leave, and the kid can't drive then then the kid may not ask to go home because they know they can't. Also, sometimes people are fine up until they aren't. For example, I have a problem with my blood pressure dropping fast completely randomly.

I've been teaching for 24 years and I have yet to give an exam that was so fucking important or time-sensitive that it had to be given right then, at that moment, to every student.

Many didn't even BELIEVE me when I told them what accommodations I needed.", "Point of clarification: simply having OCD doesn\u2019t require or ensure an IEP or a 504. \n\nI have diagnosed OCD since early childhood and I also worked in special education for many years.

I wish you well", "Do you disclose all your sensitive health information to your employer? Or your college ? Maybe people don't want to openly talk about their \"silent or invisible\" health issues. I have ptsd from the military and my employer doesn't know about it nor do they need to but if I'm having a day that is to much I can leave or not come in without telling why and that is an adult job why would you be more strict with kids in school? They can redo the test if needed weather they are lying or not and it's not the teachers job to diagnose kids with any sickness its the nurse unless you expect the nurse to walk into a classroom and start teacher geology or whatever.", "I don't really care that much as regards teens taking advantage or whatever. I think there's an ethical responsibility to let folks go to the nurse. Or the bathroom", "Yes.\nWhen they collapse, they\u2019re sick.\nWhen they puke, they\u2019re sick.\nWhen they soil themselves, they\u2019re sick.\nWhen they say they don\u2019t feel good, they\u2019re every other student in the building.", "So anyone can claim that they \"are not feeling well\" to buy themselves a few more days to study for the test and not be expected to provide substantiation of their illness of disability.\n\nHow is that fair to the students who did the work?", "The description indicates that the school was not made aware of the student's supposed disability until *after* the student flunked the test.\n\nThe teacher cannot read minds. The parents have some responsibility here.", "Student is also having a mental break.", "You sound like a fair teacher and I bet your students respect you.", "Ditto.", "some kids don't have health insurance to be able to go to a doctor. some kids' parents don't follow through with getting govt assistance for healthcare. how do you substantiate a stomachache for example, if not somehow going to the doctor same day- and there's not a 'test' to say 'yes' you have a stomachache, or no you don't. it's not that simple. I'd rather kids get more time even if they're lying about it than kids get fucked over at school because they're poor or the illness isn't something you'd be willing to pay a copay for nothing", "That's true.  It's on the parents to make sure that the teachers have the information they need. I am a little sensitive to ppl saying that whole \"you don't look sick \" because I have narcolepsy and ibs. Neither are visible,  but both affect me in educational settings.", "That cannot be determined by what she said and you know that. She asked to not take the test because she wasn\u2019t feeling well. OP didn\u2019t mention anything that would indicate that the student was in distress.", "If you do not require proof to get a disability exemption, then you are encouraging teenagers to lie to get out of examinations.", "Not feeling well is not being in distress? Also if it is her OCD causing issues, it\u2019s entirely possible she felt there was nothing the nurse could do. \n\nThere are plenty of comments from people here saying once they were told no, had difficulty asserting themselves further. \n\nIs it really the end of the world if it turned out she was faking? It\u2019s clear OP\u2019s opinion of the student prejudiced her thinking in this case."]}
