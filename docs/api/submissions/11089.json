Not in the sense that is typically meant. So you were correct that she was not sick. \n\nSecond, you can't accommodate a disability you haven't been told about and don't know the student has. You're not a mind reader. Kids can't just show up on the day of a test and say \"oh I have a problem.\" Lol no. That would get abused so so fast. \n\nSome kids will do anything to get out of class.

All she said was she doesn't feel well. It's the nurse's job to determine whether she's sick or not, not the teachers. So YTA", "She never said that she had ocd and being sick is common excuse", "The kid could have said it as well", "I've got Crohn's. Twice now I've nearly died and needed emergency surgery because of it. While the first time I did indeed look ill (though I didn't realize just how bad it was until I was at the hospital), the second time it hit me all of a sudden. I had felt completely fine until I just wasn't any more.\n\nPretty sure that teacher would have been the death of me if I had been her student during my second emergency. She's definitely YTA.", "I totally worded my thing wrong my point is she\u2019s not fully at fault but the parents are", "No brainer:  send her to the nurse. The end.", "I see your point which is true but at the same time the kid could have said what was wrong as well", "The kid is 17, which puts them in either their Junior or Senior year. This was the first time that she needed help in HS? The idea that the kid would have accommodations in her hand turkey days and macaroni necklace days but not in her trig, calc, and physics days doesn't make sense.", "Ill say it again. The student having OCD isnt the issue. The issue is the teacher dismissing the student (any student) that came to them disclosing they arent feeling well just because the looked outwardly fine.\n\nThis time the issue was a student who turned out to have OCD and things were ultimately fine. \n\nWhat happens when the teacher maintains this practice of evaluating health just on outward appearance and winds up dismissing a student with a more severe concern not immediately noticeable?", "The student did speak up and was dismissed by the teacher.", "And what do you call the student going up to the teacher with their concerns of not feeling well if not \u201cspeaking up for themselves?\u201d Also a big stretch to assume if the student kept pushing the issue about seeing a nurse that the teacher would therefore bend to their request. This teacher made a health evaluation based on physical appearance at a glance alone, a change of heart based on a student persistence for the issue is expecting a bit much.\n\nYou had a student lie about allergies to sneak off to see girlfriend. Do you therefore expect ever student from there on to be lying about their illness and issues?\n\nCorrect me if im wrong, but youre using this example of yours to showcase that students can and will sometimes fake illness to get out a test and so therefore this teacher had a right to doubt the students claim of feeling ill due to it possibly being a ploy to get out of the test. \n\nBasing your logic on the scenario at hand, if the teacher has this type of mindset, how would the student \u201cspeaking up for themselves\u201d about seeing a nurse sway the teacher at all? If \n a teacher is so paranoid that their students are trying to ditch a test than, it would be easy to assume the students persistence on the issue is really just their strong desire to avoid the test.\n\nThe teacher was the adult here. They dismissed a students real health concern. They are the AH", "I had childhood migraines, and now an adult migraine disorder. I wasn't diagnosed until I was in high school. In elementary, I was able to ask to see the nurse at any time, as I would get intensely sick at random. When I went to middle school, no one knew about this. There was no official paperwork, just agreements between my teachers and the nurse. My parents weren't even told, unbeknownst to me.\n\nI got sick during a math test my first year of middle school. I asked to go to the nurse. I was told if I left, I would instantly fail, so I stayed out of fear. Still failed. I also never asked to go to the nurse for a migraine again, even though high school, as I was convinced I would always be told no. You can *never* assume what a child's experience is.", "No haha, think it over again. Student approaches teacher saying they arent feeling well, teacher does a once over on students outward appearance, teacher decides \u201cnah your fine, keep working,\u201d turns out student was not fine. \n\nThis time, it was mental health issue, next time, its something like low blood sugar in a type one diabetic. But because they look fine on the outside than the students lying right?? \n\n\u201cEveryone lies\u201d what a bottom of the barrel take to have", "How about a student jumping around and laughing/messing around with their friends then less than 15 mins later is in the nurses' office awaiting an ambulance to a hospital for a severe  cardiac episode. With no prior occurrence. That shit fucks you up as an educator. Not every student lies and not every student looks sick prior to getting sick.", "I find that hard to believe.", "lol. Nice after you deleted the original post.", "Uuummm... most schools do not have full-time nurses on staff, so it actually does fall on the classroom teacher to be the first evaluation of illness. \n\nWithout knowing OP's location, as a retired teacher myself, I can tell you there are laws and procedures put in place about seeking special accommodations for students. In MOST cases, a teacher cannot be held responsible for information they were not given in the first place.", "Not all schools have nurses", "It\u2019s not really the job of teachers to police whether or not students are being honest about their illnesses. \n\nSend her to the nurse and let them make the judgement call.", "Exactly! People are on here thinking the teacher isnt in the wrong based solely on the fact that they didnt know about the OCD at the time.\n\nThats not the point though. \n\nWhether or not the teacher knew about the OCD doesn\u2019t negate the fact that they dismissed a students concern of their own well being based solely a quick glance of their physical appearance.\n\nMental health isnt the only \u201cinvisible\u201d issue one can be dealing with. There are plenty of other illnesses youre not going to detect from someones outward appearance", "Which she didn\u2019t do and should have.", "Maybe, maybe not. I have OCD, and sometimes when the fear, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts take hold I can\u2019t communicate the problem. It\u2019s a hellacious feeling at times. It\u2019s also not on her to be forced to disclose her disability to her teacher, especially in the silent classroom full of her peers. The parents should have done their due diligence so no one ended up in this situation.", "She likely didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing so, especially in front of a class. She\u2019s also not required to. I don\u2019t have to tell my employer why I\u2019m calling out, a student doesn\u2019t need to tell the teacher.", "Oh who cares\n\nI posted that when i got the comment notifcation", "If there was no school nurse, then a counselor would suffice. If neither of those were available, then I'm worried about what the school does have available for the children. Most severely underprivileged schools have one or the other, even if they're mediocre.", "That\u2019s my point to a extent I totally understand that so I think the parents are mostly at fault, but just because I\u2019m defending the teacher doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not at fault she should\u2019ve sent her to the nurse but she not fully at fault", "Yes I also agree with that but she didn\u2019t ask to be sent to the nurse but to asked to take the test at a different time if she asked to be sent to the nurse I\u2019d have a different opinion", "You are woefully uneducated about the state of most educational institutions. Counselors have HUNDREDS of students. Principals get very angry if we send up every kid who claims to be sick. The schools rely on teachers to be the first line of sight in a massive pool of faces."]}
