This is disturbing on so many levels and you need to ask your wife if she wants to go to therapy because she needs to not defend them under the guise of being non confrontational and whatever fucked up family dynamic she grew up in that makes her think they shouldn't get their widdle fee-fees hurt needs to be unpacked so she can live a healthier life with you without her mother and brother becoming points of contention in your marriage", "YTA don't kink shame.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But since you were drunk, it's probably a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. Maybe next time, they should not mention any household drama with guests around.
