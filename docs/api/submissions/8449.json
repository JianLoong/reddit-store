I asked them nicely to stop and they wouldn't stop blaming each other for who's fault it was and then started fucking arguing more.\n\nI was supposed to make them a snack and I kept offering different foods and they both kept saying no to all my suggestions. I asked them what they want then and they said Mac N cheese and I told them I'm not cooking and they could choose something else if they wanted to. Leo insisted he knew how to make it in the microwave, so I told him he could knock himself out, but he didn't; when he took it out, he accidentally spilled hot water on Theo and also the macaroni was clearly undercooked and just gross looking. They ended up not eating at all.\n\nI told them to go to the couch and watch TV so I could get some hw done, and guess what. They argued. Again.\n\nThis time it was over what TV show to watch. Theo THREW THE REMOTE at Leo's head and he started to cry. I told them they better hand me that remote and guess what Theo does. Instead of handing it to me nicely, he throws it at my head too. I told them that's it, I'm leaving, and they both looked like they didn't believe me.\n\nI texted their Mom what happened and that I wasn't staying and she begged me to at least until she got home. I told her I'm not staying in a place I don't even feel safe at, and left.\n\nThe twins mom called my mom, and when she got home she yelled at me and said I made her look bad.

Please find a job that doesn\u2019t involve children next time.", "WHAT?! I sincerely hope this post is fake. If it\u2019s true, obviously YTA, OP. You left two six-year-old children alone in a house, unsupervised, when someone was paying you to babysit them. No matter what the circumstances are, that is never acceptable. Something very bad could have happened to those kids, and it would have been your fault. Your safety was not at risk in this situation, but theirs was.\n\nAlso you intentionally *put* them in dangerous situations. They didn\u2019t want the snacks you offered and asked for mac and cheese. Instead of making the mac and cheese or finding an alternative snack, YOU LET A SIX YEAR OLD HANDLE BOILING WATER. You don\u2019t let six-year-old kids cook by themselves, you dingus.\n\nWhen they were throwing things, you LEFT THE HOUSE AND ALLOWED THE DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR TO CONTINUE. What if they had injured one another? As the adult, it was your responsibility to discipline them in this situation and make sure they were safe. \n\nWhat on earth were you thinking? You\u2019re far too old to be that immature and irresponsible. At 18, you should know better than ALL of this. \n\nWhat you\u2019re describing is ordinary behavior for children that age. You were in charge of them, and you should have been able to handle that. You clearly should never be allowed around children.", "YTA and shouldn\u2019t be in charge of anyone, especially young children.", "Wait, did you just say you left two 6 year old unattended because they were fighting?\n\nYou're not only TA but what you've done is actually a crime.  Way to go.", "Holy crap are YTA and so freaking irresponsible. YOU are the problem. YOU. Honest to goodness. Don't ever babysit again because you obviously aren't responsible enough or aware enough to handle it. You did make your mother look bad but you made yourself look so much worse. If I was that mother and could find a way to get you in legal trouble for abandoning CHILDREN like that I seriously would.", "YTA.\n\nYou let a small child *spill hot water* on himself and his brother and *you* didn\u2019t feel safe? \n\nYou should never be allowed children ever again.", "... you know that what you did was child endangerment and/or child abandonment, and that the mom could press charge against you, right ?!\n\nYTA.

Guess what, YOU were supposed to be in charge, you were being paid, and you think that it is time for you to do HW while there is conflict going on?  You may be 18, but YOU need to grow up!", "YTA, do us a favour and don't have any kids.", "Do yourself and everyone else a favour and don\u2019t babysit again. You clearly don\u2019t have experience.

Kids can suck sometimes. You chose to do that job. However, most places I know it\u2019s not legal to leave 6 year olds home alone. You call the mom. Tell her you\u2019re leaving and to get home right away. You don\u2019t get to just walk out and leave in the middle of the job, potentially endangering the lives and safety of two little kids. I wish cps reports could be filed on people like that. To make sure they can\u2019t be left in charge of kids.", "YTA. So yeah, a little to your mom because she helped you get this gig, but moreso to those kids and their mother. \n\nShe could be reported for neglect since you left her kids alone and you also exposed them to dangerous conditions (a 6 year old should not be handling near-boiling water). They were also acting like relatively normal 6 year olds, so I would suggest not babysitting again in the future.", "YTA. Leaving children without supervision is child endangerment. If youre not cut out for babysitting, thats fine, but you cant just bail when lives are potentially at risk.", "YTA. When you babysit, you can ask the mother what kind of punishments are fitting if they don't want to listen to you, or they are misbehaving. Also ask what do they normally eat afterschool if they have snacks. \n\nSecondly, if the kids are hungry, of course they're going to fight and lash out their irritation on each other if they won't eat what you suggested and you won't make what they want. It also doesn't sound like you have a lot of skill in resolving issues, such as \"Leo gets to pick one show to watch, and then Theo gets to pick the next show.\" \n\nA lot of things you could have done differently, as the authority figure in the house.

I can\u2019t believe you wouldn\u2019t even bother to MICROWAVE some mac n cheese for a kid that YOU are responsible to feed! Also you\u2019re being paid to watch the kids, not do your homework.\nI get that the kids were annoying but if you suck with kids don\u2019t be a babysitter. Go work at red lobster. Smh. Shame on you.", "YTA\n\nYou are (technically) an adult. They are children. Annoying children, but children nonetheless. So you're going to abandon children under your responsibility because you don't know how to manage kids? Good god, never babysit again and apologize to your mother for humiliating her in front of her co-worker.", "YTA- they are 6 years old!!! You should be doing activities with them, making a hot snack, and engaging them instead of doing homework! No wonder things got out of hand.", "YTA \n\nYou are an adult who pursued this as a job. You agreed to babysit these children.\n\nThe main responsibilities of a babysitter is to supervise and care for the child/children in their care. You failed multiple times. Finally you left six year old children unattended.", "YTA. You let a six year old deal with boiling water?????? Because you are too lazy or what, too special to microwave them some mac n cheese? And then you left them alone? Stay away from children. All children. Don't HAVE children. You don't have the common sense of a grape nut. You are dumber than a box of rocks with all the smart rocks taken out.", "YTA. At 18 you are an adult and should know better than to allow 6 year olds to cook. You are seriously lucky the kid didn't end up in hospital with severe burns. \n\nThen to walk out and leave them home alone? You twice endangered these kids. I'd not let you around any child", "Yta for leaving 6 year olds unsupervised.  That's abuse. You should have waited for the mom to return home then quit. \n\nWildly irresponsible", "YTA and you're lucky the mom didn't press charges, because I would have. \n\nYou took on responsibility for 2 -6 year olds. They are kids. Kids argue, kids are picky, kids have zero impulse control.\n\nYou clearly are not responsible enough or mature enough to be a baby sitter.", "YTA, they are kids and twins it's obviously not an easy job but you dealt with them with selfishness trying to make it \"easy\" for you. They argued? No shit?! They are 6 and siblings, did you never met kids in your life, everything that happened was totally expectable and manageable.", "YTA. They're SIX. You do not leave two six year olds alone in the house, and you do not let a six year old make Mac & Cheese even if he says he can.   \n\n\nSounds like a dreadful babysitting job, but you still are obligated to stay with them til their mom gets home, even if you then walk out and never go back.", "Wow you left children in the house ALONE! Did you not think that something dangerous could have happend to them? And what did you expect? All children are angels and well behaved, they were just acting like children, if you have anger issues or can't handel YOUR JOB then just quit and stop blaming others, honestly you should do a favor and look for a different kind of job, babysitting is clearly not your strongest point. You seriously should be thanking god that nothing happened to the kids or you will  be in trouble.", "YTA\u2026 I get that some kids are outrageously annoying and disrespectful, but it\u2019s highkey illegal to leave 6 year olds home alone. The mom could have gotten in trouble if a nosey neighbor decided to report her. You agreed to babysit them and aside from them arguing and you dodging a remote, nothing happened worth leaving them home alone. You should have stayed until the mom got home and just never babysat them again. I doubt two 6 year olds were going to cause you serious harm.", "YTA for literally leaving six-year-olds unsupervised and for not supervising them when you were in their presence. You would have been TA just for expecting to get your homework done on the clock, but you went so far beyond that.", "This can't be real", "YTA. If this is even real it made my stomach turn.", "YTA. \n\nYou out the kids in at least two dangerous situations while claiming you felt \"unsafe.\" You also failed at the basics of babysitting. You refused to cook for them, entertain them, or properly supervise them. \n\nWhat the mom needs to do is file a police report. You left the kids unsupervised and did not contact the mom or seek medical attention (or likely even offer basic first aid) when the hot water was spilled.", "Is this real?!?!? Because I\u2019m gobsmacked. YTA and clearly not fit to be a babysitter. For starters you should\u2019ve made them the mac&cheese and not expected a 6 year old to be able to make it. It\u2019s not that hard to make Kraft but it\u2019s not something a kid should be doing. I\u2019ve done a lot of babysitting and part of that is making food for the kids. That aside I cannot believe you left two 6 years old alone. What made you think that was okay? You were responsible for their safety and you failed them and their mother. Kids argue all the time and it\u2019s the responsibility of the adults watching them to discipline them. It\u2019s called a time out. I\u2019m honestly feeling second hand embarrassment for you. Good luck trying to get another job. Nobody wants a babysitter who can\u2019t even do the bare minimum.", "Lol you can\u2019t just leave 6 year olds alone at home because you\u2019re unable to control their behavior. Good luck in the real world.", "YTA. And your act of leaving 6-year olds unsupervised could be considered child abuse by endangerment in some jurisdictions (even if no injury occurred). Never babysit again. You are not cut out for it.", "Wow. I mean I know you are only 18 but holy shit girl. You have a whole massive amount of growing up to do and maturity to gain. Just wow. YTA.", "Yes YTA are you out of your mind? You left two children unattended and surprise surprise kids don't all act the same, way to make sure you don't get babysitting gigs for awhile and gossip about your mother\n\nAlso you didn't check on the child that poured hot water on their brother? Did you clean the mess? Why not separate so they didn't fight?", "YTA. This is really common sense. They are kids, you wouldn\u2019t get paid to watch kids if it was easy todo. You\u2019re faulting them for acting like kids. As the baby sitter who is getting paid, why couldn\u2019t you just make them the food they asked for and avoided the mess? Regardless of how the kids are acting and how you feel, you can\u2019t leave two 6 year olds alone like that. Sounds like you basically wanted to get paid for nothing and it will also most likely cause your mom some grief at work.", "Did you post this thinking what you did was right? There is no justification for leaving 2 six year olds alone.  I hope you take this as a learning experience. Whether  that child care is not for you or that you need to do much better. If you ever have your own children you'll realize how horrific this is.\n\nYes, YTA", "YTA and I'd guess a brat yourself if you're complaining about kids beings kids. Probably wise not to offer to babysit again.", "YTA and the moms TA for not getting someone competent for this job. Also pretty sure you committed a crime? You can\u2019t just leave children alone like that. You should not pursue this job path further.\n\nAs a nanny with 15 years experience it still boggles my mind how someone would hire someone who has (basically) no experience, to care for their children. There are actual skills involved in this job. You have to have patience for one. And understand children at least enough to know how to handle a fight.\n\nIt\u2019s after school babysitting 101 to get them with a snack and if they\u2019re going to cook at all, you need to closely supervise them, at the very least. \n\nYou should have discussed up front any behavioral challenges they might have and how you can incorporate their discipline methods when you\u2019re there. \n\nI don\u2019t expect you to know all this because you don\u2019t have experience but as an adult you should know leaving 2 six year olds at home alone is not okay.", "YTA and i hope the mom sues you for breach of contract and negligence", "You left small children alone?!?\n\nIf those were my kids I'd fucking kill you. I would definitely be calling the police to get you charged with child endangerment. Which you absolutely deserve.", "YTA", "Well aren\u2019t you just every parents\u2019 worst nightmare. YTA.", "YTA. I hope the mother presses charges for child endangerment. You left two 6 year olds in a house alone bc they threw a remote at you. It wasn\u2019t a knife or something heavy.

You're an AH to even imagine something like this in your head and pretend it really happened.\n\nOn the 0.1% chance that this is actually true I hope the mother calls the cops on you. Telling 6 year old children to make their own food and be quiet so you could do homework, which you weren't supposed to do in the first place while watching young children, is an absolute Asshole behavior but leaving such young children alone who are under your watch with no intention of coming back or waiting for another adult to arrive is illegal.

I don't understand how you could think otherwise. You accepted a babysitting job because you thought it was easy money. You then decided to basically leave 6 year olds to their own devices. You really can't just ask them nicely to stop arguing and leave it at that. They are 6, whatever they're arguing about is important to them becayse they have very very little life experience.

That is so delusional...", "Yta, you\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t call the cops, personally I think she should have.", "Yta, whats worse is you were\u2019nt even doing your job from the sounds of it. They hired you to sit, not the tv. Also who tf lets a 6 yr old cook without supervision. You\u2019re a moron and have no business being around kids.", "YTA. What you did is a literal crime, and you\u2019re a legal adult. Good luck, buttercup.", "YTA. Kids can be weenies but they're *six*. You can't leave six-year-olds alone. You also can't let them boil water in a microwave. Good lord, don't be around kids.", "YTA. Wow. Truly have never seen someone misunderstand a job description as hard as you did. You shrugged off every single part of your responsibilities the moment they came up.", "They're kids. You described kids being kids. Probably kids who were feeling a bit overwhelmed because they hadn't been left with you before, but instead of trying to stay calm and be understanding, you made a very immature decision to abandon your responsibilities. You are an adult, you can't just walk away from your commitments. I'm completely ignoring the fact you left to very underage minors alone, because thats literally just unacceptable and extremely dangerous.\n\nYTA. Please never try watching children again unless you actually do some research. Heck I wouldn't even trust you with a dog after reading that.", "YTA you reached that breaking point extremely fast. What made you think babysitting was a good job for you if you clearly dislike children? \n\nEverything you described was extremely normal behavior for that. Should they throw things? No. Of course not. Are they gonna? Yea probably. They're kids and siblings at that, this behavior is what my dad would call \"age appropriate inappropriate behavior\" in simpler terms it's bad behavior that is also extremely common and almost characteristic of that age group. Like rebellion in teens. \n\nI've had rough sitting jobs and worked at a few daycares as well. Kids I worked with were 6 weeks to 4 years usually while occasionally helping with older kids. I have been hit, kicked, spat on, bitten, stabbed (with a spork) and had tons of crap thrown at me. Again, not ok behavior, but also very common. I never once ditched the kids and left them unattended. Even if I reached a breaking point I would wait for someone to come relieve me. What you did was absurd and possibly illegal. \n\nApologize to the mom for abandoning her kids. Apologize to your mom for making her look bad when she was trying to help you. When someone sticks their neck out to get you a job you do not immediately do the worst possible job and then act like they're crazy for being upset. Don't babysit again until you've grown up more yourself and developed the level of patience that is required for childcare.\n\nEdit for spelling, grammar and punctuation", "What the fuck is wrong with you? \n\nYTA. Come on. You refused to cook and LET THE 6 YEAR OLD COOK FOR HIMSELF? Then you just\u2026 left them? \n\nYou\u2019re not gonna make it in life OP", "Yeah, YTA. You\u2019re not mature enough to babysit. You left 6 year olds alone, which is actually child endangerment. It\u2019s recklessly illegal. You showed no responsibility or basic understanding of what babysitting entails.\n\nKids aren\u2019t easy. That\u2019s why parents give people money to watch the kids. Kids bicker, constantly. It\u2019s annoying. That\u2019s life. They also whine, need help with things, fight, ask incessant questions, and act totally irrational.\n\nYou should have known basics like that before going in. You should have given them clear expectations, you should have been prepared with snacks. Don\u2019t accept or look for jobs you don\u2019t have the ability to even attempt to do. That\u2019s what you did. You made your mom look a fool at work too.\n\nYou\u2019re 18. You should have been able to handle those children just fine.

Your best bet for a job is an OnlyFans site.", "YTA\n\nAs a babysitter you aren't being paid to sit and do homework.\n\nYou are being paid to interact and keep the children entertained especially the first few times when you are getting to know each other.\n\nMaking macaroni and cheese in the microwave is hardly \"cooking\" or beyond the scope of the reasonable duties of an 18 year old who is babysitting.\n\nYou weren't \"lucky\" with your cousins. You and they had an existing relationship and so either they interacted with you as usual or they did their \"thing\" because - again - they were used to you.\n\nYou don't abandon 6 year old because the job is a bit harder than you expected. It really wasn't anything out of the ordinary in terms of six year olds \"testing\" a new sitter.", "What is wrong with you? \n\nYou are way too old to be this irresponsible and immature.

Don\u2019t ever babysit again. Seriously, it\u2019s not for you.\n\nWhat I hear is two six year olds who acted like six year olds.

Two six year olds? You couldn\u2019t even wait for their mom to get to you? Are you insane? You\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t report you for child abandonment and endangerment. They were supposed to be in your care.", "WTF, man. You got mad at kids because you clearly have no idea how to talk to them, and then just LEFT them alone?? A couple of 6 year olds? What is wrong with you?\n\nYTA", "HOLY HELL YTA!! Of course they argue about everything. They are 6 and twins!!! You left them alone?!? What in the hell is wrong with you? If I was that mom I\u2019d press for child abandonment and endangerment charges. \n\nWho the hell let\u2019s a 6 year old make Mac and cheese in the microwave without helping to remove the boiling hot water? Cheese and rice!!! You are the WORST babysitter ever. Do not watch anyone else\u2019s children EVER.", "WTAF if wrong with you!?!?", "You are the worst babysitter ever. Maybe you could work with rocks? \n\nYTA", "Better hope they don't decide to press charges, asshole.", "YTA 100%. Arguing and being grumpy after school is normal 6 year old behavior.  And you handled it badly and escalated it.  And then threw a hissy fit and left.  You left little kids alone.", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t just leave 6 year olds home alone because you can\u2019t handle them. You shouldn\u2019t be watching kids. That was pretty standard sibling behavior at that age when they get frustrated.", "Holy crap YTA. This is just sad and embarrassing. Babysitting is not a good job for you. You refused to prepare a snack, doesn't sound like you made any attempt to correct their behavior or discipline them on any way, told them to entertain themselves so you could do hw instead of doing your actual job, AND you abandoned two children who clearly cannot be trusted to behave at home alone. No one believes you were concerned for your safety. That is such a lame excuse for abandoning children. You should not have waited until 18 to learn how to be a decent, responsible human being. I hope you can do a little reflecting and see how irresponsible, lazy, and entitled your behavior was and maybe learn something from it. Don't expect your mom to help you get a job anywhere in the future.", "YTA. That was all pretty standard behaviour. There are a million ways you could have handled this whole situation. You are an adult who abandoned children you were in charge of. You\u2019re very lucky she doesn\u2019t call the police on you for child neglect. You should never be in charge of children, clearly.", "YTA. You left two six year olds home alone? That\u2019s appalling.

Christ.", "Yta, holy cow you\u2019re the asshole!! Leaving two six years old alone?!? That\u2019s child endangerment.

As soon as my sister was old enough to babysit she was getting the calls for the work because she would also play games and activities versus me just keeping them safe and alive and I was fine with that.

YTA for leaving 6 year olds alone when you were in charge of them. I think even more than just an asshole, negligent.

What about explaining why it is hurtful to throw a remote and having them try taking deep breaths instead of reacting? \n\nI was a nanny when I was your age for kids 6, 10 and 12. It got chaotic at times but I would have never acted like you. I voluntarily cleaned the families home, did their dishes, COOKED food for the kids, helped them actually understand their homework, played sports, made up games, the list goes on. \n\nYou should reevaluate yourself because YOUR actions reek of immaturity.
