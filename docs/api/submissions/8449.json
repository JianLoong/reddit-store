Her co-worker's cousin was friend's with a single mom who's babysitter recently moved, and she just needed someone to watch her kids after school.\n\nShe has two twins who are both 6M, and yesterday was my first day working. Let's call them Leo and Theo.\n\nI was supposed to pick them up at their bus stop, and the minute they stepped out they were already arguing about stupid shit. When we got to their house, they still wouldn't stop. I asked them nicely to stop and they wouldn't stop blaming each other for who's fault it was and then started fucking arguing more.\n\nI was supposed to make them a snack and I kept offering different foods and they both kept saying no to all my suggestions. I asked them what they want then and they said Mac N cheese and I told them I'm not cooking and they could choose something else if they wanted to. Leo insisted he knew how to make it in the microwave, so I told him he could knock himself out, but he didn't; when he took it out, he accidentally spilled hot water on Theo and also the macaroni was clearly undercooked and just gross looking. They ended up not eating at all.\n\nI told them to go to the couch and watch TV so I could get some hw done, and guess what. They argued. Again.\n\nThis time it was over what TV show to watch. Theo THREW THE REMOTE at Leo's head and he started to cry. I told them they better hand me that remote and guess what Theo does. Instead of handing it to me nicely, he throws it at my head too. I told them that's it, I'm leaving, and they both looked like they didn't believe me.\n\nI texted their Mom what happened and that I wasn't staying and she begged me to at least until she got home. I told her I'm not staying in a place I don't even feel safe at, and left.\n\nThe twins mom called my mom, and when she got home she yelled at me and said I made her look bad. I told her she literally cares more about how she looks rather than that those kids were acting like complete brats and throwing stuff at people\n\nShe's still pretty pissed off, and, maybe I should've put up with it but I seriously was at my breaking point, AITA?", "created_utc": 1674848666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mu1i3/aita_for_leaving_my_babysitting_job_early/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please find a job that doesn\u2019t involve children next time.", "WHAT?! I sincerely hope this post is fake. If it\u2019s true, obviously YTA, OP. You left two six-year-old children alone in a house, unsupervised, when someone was paying you to babysit them. No matter what the circumstances are, that is never acceptable. Something very bad could have happened to those kids, and it would have been your fault. Your safety was not at risk in this situation, but theirs was.\n\nAlso you intentionally *put* them in dangerous situations. They didn\u2019t want the snacks you offered and asked for mac and cheese. Instead of making the mac and cheese or finding an alternative snack, YOU LET A SIX YEAR OLD HANDLE BOILING WATER. You don\u2019t let six-year-old kids cook by themselves, you dingus.\n\nWhen they were throwing things, you LEFT THE HOUSE AND ALLOWED THE DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR TO CONTINUE. What if they had injured one another? As the adult, it was your responsibility to discipline them in this situation and make sure they were safe. \n\nWhat on earth were you thinking? You\u2019re far too old to be that immature and irresponsible. At 18, you should know better than ALL of this. \n\nWhat you\u2019re describing is ordinary behavior for children that age. You were in charge of them, and you should have been able to handle that. You clearly should never be allowed around children.", "YTA and shouldn\u2019t be in charge of anyone, especially young children.", "Wait, did you just say you left two 6 year old unattended because they were fighting?\n\nYou're not only TA but what you've done is actually a crime.  Way to go.", "Holy crap are YTA and so freaking irresponsible. YOU are the problem. YOU. Honest to goodness. Don't ever babysit again because you obviously aren't responsible enough or aware enough to handle it. You did make your mother look bad but you made yourself look so much worse. If I was that mother and could find a way to get you in legal trouble for abandoning CHILDREN like that I seriously would.", "YTA.\n\nYou let a small child *spill hot water* on himself and his brother and *you* didn\u2019t feel safe? \n\nYou should never be allowed children ever again.", "... you know that what you did was child endangerment and/or child abandonment, and that the mom could press charge against you, right ?!\n\nYTA.

Guess what, YOU were supposed to be in charge, you were being paid, and you think that it is time for you to do HW while there is conflict going on?  You may be 18, but YOU need to grow up!", "YTA, do us a favour and don't have any kids.", "Do yourself and everyone else a favour and don\u2019t babysit again. You clearly don\u2019t have experience.

Kids can suck sometimes. You chose to do that job. However, most places I know it\u2019s not legal to leave 6 year olds home alone. You call the mom. Tell her you\u2019re leaving and to get home right away. You don\u2019t get to just walk out and leave in the middle of the job, potentially endangering the lives and safety of two little kids. I wish cps reports could be filed on people like that. To make sure they can\u2019t be left in charge of kids.", "YTA. So yeah, a little to your mom because she helped you get this gig, but moreso to those kids and their mother. \n\nShe could be reported for neglect since you left her kids alone and you also exposed them to dangerous conditions (a 6 year old should not be handling near-boiling water). They were also acting like relatively normal 6 year olds, so I would suggest not babysitting again in the future.", "YTA. Leaving children without supervision is child endangerment. If youre not cut out for babysitting, thats fine, but you cant just bail when lives are potentially at risk.", "YTA. When you babysit, you can ask the mother what kind of punishments are fitting if they don't want to listen to you, or they are misbehaving. Also ask what do they normally eat afterschool if they have snacks. \n\nSecondly, if the kids are hungry, of course they're going to fight and lash out their irritation on each other if they won't eat what you suggested and you won't make what they want. It also doesn't sound like you have a lot of skill in resolving issues, such as \"Leo gets to pick one show to watch, and then Theo gets to pick the next show.\" \n\nA lot of things you could have done differently, as the authority figure in the house.

I can\u2019t believe you wouldn\u2019t even bother to MICROWAVE some mac n cheese for a kid that YOU are responsible to feed! Also you\u2019re being paid to watch the kids, not do your homework.\nI get that the kids were annoying but if you suck with kids don\u2019t be a babysitter. Go work at red lobster. Smh. Shame on you.", "YTA\n\nYou are (technically) an adult. They are children. Annoying children, but children nonetheless. So you're going to abandon children under your responsibility because you don't know how to manage kids? Good god, never babysit again and apologize to your mother for humiliating her in front of her co-worker.", "YTA- they are 6 years old!!! You should be doing activities with them, making a hot snack, and engaging them instead of doing homework! No wonder things got out of hand.", "YTA \n\nYou are an adult who pursued this as a job. You agreed to babysit these children.\n\nThe main responsibilities of a babysitter is to supervise and care for the child/children in their care. You failed multiple times. Finally you left six year old children unattended.", "YTA. You let a six year old deal with boiling water?????? Because you are too lazy or what, too special to microwave them some mac n cheese? And then you left them alone? Stay away from children. All children. Don't HAVE children. You don't have the common sense of a grape nut. You are dumber than a box of rocks with all the smart rocks taken out.", "YTA. At 18 you are an adult and should know better than to allow 6 year olds to cook. You are seriously lucky the kid didn't end up in hospital with severe burns. \n\nThen to walk out and leave them home alone? You twice endangered these kids. I'd not let you around any child", "Yta for leaving 6 year olds unsupervised.  That's abuse. You should have waited for the mom to return home then quit. \n\nWildly irresponsible", "YTA and you're lucky the mom didn't press charges, because I would have. \n\nYou took on responsibility for 2 -6 year olds. They are kids. Kids argue, kids are picky, kids have zero impulse control.\n\nYou clearly are not responsible enough or mature enough to be a baby sitter.", "YTA, they are kids and twins it's obviously not an easy job but you dealt with them with selfishness trying to make it \"easy\" for you. They argued? No shit?! They are 6 and siblings, did you never met kids in your life, everything that happened was totally expectable and manageable.", "YTA. They're SIX. You do not leave two six year olds alone in the house, and you do not let a six year old make Mac & Cheese even if he says he can.   \n\n\nSounds like a dreadful babysitting job, but you still are obligated to stay with them til their mom gets home, even if you then walk out and never go back.", "Wow you left children in the house ALONE! Did you not think that something dangerous could have happend to them? And what did you expect? All children are angels and well behaved, they were just acting like children, if you have anger issues or can't handel YOUR JOB then just quit and stop blaming others, honestly you should do a favor and look for a different kind of job, babysitting is clearly not your strongest point. You seriously should be thanking god that nothing happened to the kids or you will  be in trouble.", "YTA\u2026 I get that some kids are outrageously annoying and disrespectful, but it\u2019s highkey illegal to leave 6 year olds home alone. The mom could have gotten in trouble if a nosey neighbor decided to report her. You agreed to babysit them and aside from them arguing and you dodging a remote, nothing happened worth leaving them home alone. You should have stayed until the mom got home and just never babysat them again. I doubt two 6 year olds were going to cause you serious harm.", "YTA for literally leaving six-year-olds unsupervised and for not supervising them when you were in their presence. You would have been TA just for expecting to get your homework done on the clock, but you went so far beyond that.", "This can't be real", "YTA. If this is even real it made my stomach turn.", "YTA. \n\nYou out the kids in at least two dangerous situations while claiming you felt \"unsafe.\" You also failed at the basics of babysitting. You refused to cook for them, entertain them, or properly supervise them. \n\nWhat the mom needs to do is file a police report. You left the kids unsupervised and did not contact the mom or seek medical attention (or likely even offer basic first aid) when the hot water was spilled.", "Is this real?!?!? Because I\u2019m gobsmacked. YTA and clearly not fit to be a babysitter. For starters you should\u2019ve made them the mac&cheese and not expected a 6 year old to be able to make it. It\u2019s not that hard to make Kraft but it\u2019s not something a kid should be doing. I\u2019ve done a lot of babysitting and part of that is making food for the kids. That aside I cannot believe you left two 6 years old alone. What made you think that was okay? You were responsible for their safety and you failed them and their mother. Kids argue all the time and it\u2019s the responsibility of the adults watching them to discipline them. It\u2019s called a time out. I\u2019m honestly feeling second hand embarrassment for you. Good luck trying to get another job. Nobody wants a babysitter who can\u2019t even do the bare minimum.", "Lol you can\u2019t just leave 6 year olds alone at home because you\u2019re unable to control their behavior. Good luck in the real world.", "YTA. And your act of leaving 6-year olds unsupervised could be considered child abuse by endangerment in some jurisdictions (even if no injury occurred). Never babysit again. You are not cut out for it.", "Wow. I mean I know you are only 18 but holy shit girl. You have a whole massive amount of growing up to do and maturity to gain. Just wow. YTA.", "Yes YTA are you out of your mind? You left two children unattended and surprise surprise kids don't all act the same, way to make sure you don't get babysitting gigs for awhile and gossip about your mother\n\nAlso you didn't check on the child that poured hot water on there other? Did you clean the mess? Why not separate so they didn't fight?", "YTA. This is really common sense. They are kids, you wouldn\u2019t get paid to watch kids if it was easy todo. You\u2019re faulting them for acting like kids. As the baby sitter who is getting paid, why couldn\u2019t you just make them the food they asked for and avoided the mess? Regardless of how the kids are acting and how you feel, you can\u2019t leave two 6 year olds alone like that. Sounds like you basically wanted to get paid for nothing and it will also most likely cause your mom some grief at work.", "Did you post this thinking what you did was right? There is no justification for leaving 2 six year olds alone.  I hope you take this as a learning experience. Whether  that child care is not for you or that you need to do much better. If you ever have your own children you'll realize how horrific this is.\n\nYes, YTA", "YTA and I'd guess a brat yourself if you're complaining about kids beings kids. Probably wise not to offer to babysit again.", "YTA and the moms TA for not getting someone competent for this job. Also pretty sure you committed a crime? You can\u2019t just leave children alone like that. You should not pursue this job path further.\n\nAs a nanny with 15 years experience it still boggles my mind how someone would hire someone who has (basically) no experience, to care for their children. There are actual skills involved in this job. You have to have patience for one. And understand children at least enough to know how to handle a fight.\n\nIt\u2019s after school babysitting 101 to get them with a snack and if they\u2019re going to cook at all, you need to closely supervise them, at the very least. \n\nYou should have discussed up front any behavioral challenges they might have and how you can incorporate their discipline methods when you\u2019re there. \n\nI don\u2019t expect you to know all this because you don\u2019t have experience but as an adult you should know leaving 2 six year olds at home alone is not okay.", "YTA and i hope the mom sues you for breach of contract and negligence", "You left small children alone?!?\n\nIf those were my kids I'd fucking kill you. I would definitely be calling the police to get you charged with child endangerment. Which you absolutely deserve.", "YTA", "Well aren\u2019t you just every parents\u2019 worst nightmare. YTA.", "YTA. I hope the mother presses charges for child endangerment. You left two 6 year olds in a house alone bc they threw a remote at you. It wasn\u2019t a knife or something heavy.

You're an AH to even imagine something like this in your head and pretend it really happened.\n\nOn the 0.1% chance that this is actually true I hope the mother calls the cops on you. Telling 6 year old children to make their own food and be quiet so you could do homework, which you weren't supposed to do in the first place while watching young children, is an absolute Asshole behavior but leaving such young children alone who are under your watch with no intention of coming back or waiting for another adult to arrive is illegal.

I don't understand how you could think otherwise. You accepted a babysitting job because you thought it was easy money. You then decided to basically leave 6 year olds to their own devices. You really can't just ask them nicely to stop arguing and leave it at that. They are 6, whatever they're arguing about is important to them becayse they have very very little life experience.

Honestly, it sounds like you really did not want to work in the first place.  And of course your mom is pissed off.  You did make her look bad.  She vouched for you.  Said you were a good person.  Her bad.  She learned her lesson.  I am surprised you were not charged with child neglect.  Or endangerment.  Consider yourself lucky, because most sitters would have been.", "Do you realize if they\u2019d been injured or god forbid died after you abandoned them, you\u2019d have that on your hands?

Newsflash, thats how kids act at that age", "You left 2 six year old alone??? YTA!", "YTA - wholeheartedly. You can never leave children that young on their own - regardless of what they\u2019re doing. You honestly have no business babysitting. Don\u2019t ask for people to put in a good word for you until your work ethic is better. You made your mom look bad at work. That\u2019s icky.", "YTA and so damn lucky those kids didn't hurt themselves after you left, you have no idea. Where I'm from you can go to jail for shit like this. \n\nAlso, getting pissy cause your mum yelled at you? Honey, this is nothing she should have taken every single priviledge away until you get smarter. My mother would have eviscerated me if I did something so criminally idiotic", "YTA. You\u2019re the adult. You need to set boundaries with these kids. It\u2019s your job to keep them safe not abandon them.", "Yta- that\u2019s the job upu signed up for.

If you can't handle two 6 year olds, you have no business babysitting. That woman trusted you with her children. If you hated it, fine, don't go back. But you left those kids alone? If I were the mother, I would be looking into if you could be charged with child endangerment.", "YTA.\n\nYou let a 6 year old try and cool, and then burn themselves! What excuse can you possibly have at 18yo for that?\n\nAs for them walking out on two vulnerable children, the mother should have called the police for you endangering them.\n\nThe children were undoubtedly challenging, but most 6 year olds are. Add into that that they're twins, so will spar off one another. You should have been prepared given you feel that you were an experienced babysitter!\n\nYTA.", "Holy shit. You\u2019re a nightmare and YTA. They\u2019re 6 and they\u2019re siblings, of course they\u2019re going to argue about dumb shit. I\u2019m going to go completely out on a limb and say you\u2019re either an only child or you have a big gap between you and your siblings (if you have any) bc you clearly have no idea what the dynamic between siblings can be. You chose babysitting bc you thought it would be easy\u2026 it\u2019s not, unless the kids are older (say 10 or 11) and can entertain themselves. YOU LEFT THEM HOME ALONE???? You\u2019re not mature enough to babysit. Did I already say YTA? YTA.", "YTC, you're the criminal.\n\nYou don't let 6 year olds play with hot water. You don't abandon children in your charge, you hand them over to someone else.\n\nLeaving like that would also have been deeply unprofessional if you had had a legitimate reason, which you didn't.", "YTA and you are lucky she didn't try to press criminal charges.  That is called child endangering.", "You.. should be arrested. Seriously.

They could have gotten seriously injured.\n\nYou told them to go watch tv *so you could do your homework.* No, you don't get to do your homework while you are actively watching them. \n\nYou did NOT even attempt to handle the arguing situation and allowed it to escalate. They are 6 yr old boys, they are going to argue. \n\nYou didn't feel safe because he threw a remote at you? Are you kidding me? What are you a princess?\n\nThen you left two 6 year olds home alone while you went and had yourself a nice little temper tantrum because it wasn't the cushy little just sit them in front of the t.v job you were hoping for. You were at your breaking point? Are you that delicate?\n\nDid you do anything right? Uh...that would be no.", "Yta \n\nIf it was appropriate to leave 6 year olds home alone, why on earth would the mom be paying someone to babysit in the first place??? \n\nYou\u2019re mom\u2019s issue is simple to fix. She just says to the involved parties \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I though I\u2019d raised my daughter to make better decisions than that, and that she was up to the responsibility of caring for those kids. I can see I was wrong, and won\u2019t be making that mistake again\u201d. Not her fault you jumped so far out of your depth you didn\u2019t even know how to get help! \n\nAnd don\u2019t babysit again.", "I had a kid try to set his house on FIRE and I still waited for his parents to come home. \n\nYTA. They\u2019re six. Wow.", "YTA. YOU ABANDONED CHILDREN. I could understand if you never went back but there is absolutely no reason you couldn\u2019t have stayed. Yeah, they sound awful and I wouldn\u2019t go back but you are in fact, an adult. You don\u2019t abandon a CHILD because they threw something at you. Also, why tf would you think it\u2019s okay for children to carry around boiling water?", "Did you ask for any instructions from the mom? Like snacks? Asking 6 yr old what they want generally leads to fight. At 6, they need to be entertained, put out a puzzle- just telling them to watch tv is so barebones. You are the asshole yta- because you thought a babysitting job is only to be a physical body there and not much else. Not only that, you could t even wait 30 min to an hour for the mom to get home, major asshole. Did you try calling your own mom for help? So as to not leave this poor woman in the lurch? No???", "YTA. \n\nYou're the one in charge, not a third kid. Don't babysit anymore. You left kids for themselves. What if something were to happen and you weren't there? What if the kid has set fire to something? What if they found a gun? What if they played with knives? What if they threw water in the outlets? What if they stuck a hand down the garbage thing in the sink, if they have that? What if they found something to eat and the food got stuck? The kids could've DIED or seriously get injured - the family could have lost their homes, and you left because you \"didn't feel safe\". Watching kids is a massive responsibility and there's a reason why people babysit. \n\nI'm sorry for sounding harsh, but this shit's important! \n\nSo you got something thrown at you? You deal with it and push through. \"Don't feel safe\" You have the responsibility, you're suppose to be the grown up and you can't handle 2 kids. \n\nI'd definitely look for other jobs if I was you.", "YTA, so you couldn't do the job you signed up for and left two 6 year olds alone to fend for themselves?  Frankly you're lucky nothing happened to them when you left and you're not getting arrested.", "YTA- you can\u2019t leave just because you don\u2019t have the skills to do the job. You can\u2019t leave kids on their own period. You showed a lack of responsibility for the job and no doubt your mom is embarrassed after finding you some work. Don\u2019t go into childcare.", "YTA why did you think this is okay. Also the Mac and cheese thing even tho you weren't going to cook, a young child should never handle hot water or attempt to make anything. It is dangerous for everyone involved. You can't just let them do anything. And not to mention leaving again they are young and can't be helped responsible/don't know how to take care of themselves. It's not like you are in serious danger but the only ones that will be is the kids left alone.", "YTA. You\u2019re lucky the mom didn\u2019t call the cops or CPS on your for child neglect for leaving them. 6 is still pretty young to be left alone and if they are like you describe, they could have done any number of things to put themselves in danger or get hurt after you left like catch the place on fire, go outside and get kidnapped or seriously injured, scalded themselves trying to cook the Mac and cheese again, etc. You have no business being a sitter if you get irritated this quickly and don\u2019t know how to handle children being naughty.", "You don\u2019t have to abandon your own kids to be charged with child abandonment.

Of course YTA\n\nPlease never babysit again", "YTA - AND YOU LEFT THEM ALONE?!? WTF!\n\nDO NOT ACCEPT ANOTHER JOB BABYSITTING.\n\nYou are woefully ill prepared for being responsible for the lives of two children.

Your refusal to make them a snack and subsequent refusal to supervise led to one being injured by the other with scalding hot water.  Then you abandoned them when they wouldn\u2019t stop bickering when it was literally your job to intervene, absolutely horrific response from the \u201cadult\u201d being paid to supervise , im shocked the mother didn\u2019t call the police immediately.  \n\nYou were not being paid to do your homework, you were being paid to supervise the children.\n\nHow tf does anyone leave 2 6 year old alone, how does this possibly compute as acceptable to you?", "YTA and you are beyond lucky that your mother knows this person and likely saved your ass from having charges pressed against you.", "YTA\n\nIs Op also 6 years old?", "When the babysitter is more of a child than the kids they are babysitting\u2026YTA and committed a crime by leaving them alone.", "YTA. It sounds like you just don't have the experience with children, especially multiple children around the same age as each other. I mean, yes it sounds like the behavior was getting out of control, but leaving two six year olds alone? Not okay. Maybe I should try leaving when my kids fight like that? Ha!", "YTA. You cannot leave kids unsupervised without their mom, and you have the stupidest reason in the world for doing it. \n\nYou didn't \"feel safe\"???? They're six year olds who threw a remote.

I could handle it better now as a professional but even then I knew better.", "Exactly this. Worst babysitting job I ever had as a teenager was watching two little monsters for 5 hours.
