They can not be trusted to act in your daughters best interest", "NTA that level of manipulation doesn't get better, they will continue to utilize her against you. I'm so sorry you're experiencing this.", "NTA. I work with sped kids and a lot of them are little parrots. You husband\u2019s family using you child as a weapon is disgusting on all the levels. I do think your husband should be more upset by this and shielding your daughter, which makes me question his involvement, but that\u2019s not part of the decision of a h or not.", "NTA. But you should make a record of this. I don\u2019t know what process would be best, but at least recording her with timestamps and maybe mentioning it to her speech therapist (the fact that she says \u00ab\u00a0say mommy hurt me\u00a0\u00bb, and not just \u00ab\u00a0mommy hurt me\u00a0\u00bb) as suspicious would be useful in case it repeats/escalates.", "NTA, keep her away from them", "Info - Why does your husband want his family to have your daughter? Because in the long run,  CPS will end up placing her with family ie his family.", "NTA, but your husband is if he isn't doing anything about this and still wants her around those people.", "NTA.  Honestly, were it me, I'd start videoing  your time alone with her. Becs if you WERE hurting her, there would be behavioral indications, even in \"normal\" interactions. And the absence of this indicator might help you in the future. I'd also talk to a social worker or atty for advice how how to deal with these family members.", "Omg so NTA! Does your husband even understand the gravity of this situation?! Your daughter is at risk of being taken away", "Trust your gut instinct, this could get really bad really quick. NTA\n\nFor grown adults to go out of their way to teach CPS trigger words to a kid, hoping the kid says it enough to get you in trouble??? Thats a huge deal. And if your husband is ok with this? I duno if I could trust him either, Im sorry. \n\nI dont think hes malicious persay. But hes your partner. And if hes not willing to see how dangerous this can get, than hes being very ignorant. And frankly, isnt helping. He should be talking with his siblings and mom, and helping set the boundary. \n\n\"You guys cant teach kiddo to say things like that. Its dangerous, mean spirited and absolutely not ok. And dont say, 'oh its a joke'. Its not a joke. Something of that caliber, is NEVER a joke. Would you all really rather kiddo be taken from us and put into the system? Out of spite for my wife? Your all ridiculous\"  IS the conversation he should be having with his family, but I digress. Good luck Op", "NTA I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this", "Hell no. You\u2019re absolutely NTA. They\u2019re trying to.. what exactly? Get your child taken away from you? They\u2019re messing with your life and your child. Keep that girl away as far as possible.", "INFO:  Have you discussed a compromise like no unsupervised visits?  Has your husband confronted his sister and mother about this?", "OMG, NTA!  Letting your child have a relationship with your husband's family is dangerous.  Can you imagine having CPS involved?  For your sake and your daughter's don't let them see her.  Your husband needs to understand that his job is to protect you and your child from harm, even if it comes from his own family.", "NTA \n\nI would not allow any visits, supervised or not. Sister is attempting to get your child taken from you and you in prison", "OP you should invest in some nanny cams. I've read stories of children being abused at daycare, school, etc and the parents put nanny cams in the backpack to find out who was doing it.", "NTA. Keep your daughter away from them. What apend if CPS go involved for something they do?? Your husband is an adult and can see them if he want, but they're no good people to be near your daughter.", "NTA Your husband is kinda selfish. Does he think one moment what will happen with your child if they take this serious? His family wants to hurt you so much that they give a fuck about what will be about your daughter, she is just a weapon. And he wants those people to see your daughter. What next? Hitting her blue and green and letting her say \"Mamma did\"? \n\nIt isn't that he has not your back, but that he doesn't want the best for his child.  It isn't the best for the child to see his family. If she is 4, she also doesn't really care so much. It is just him who wants that they are close or that he wants to give in what his family demand - even though he sees that they do such evil things. \n\nYou must start to document everything! Make a diary of what they do, if you have proofs, save them. It can be important for the future. And your child must be kept Way from the inlaws. If your husband can't accept this... i would rethink how this can work out in the future if he priotize the family over his new family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your husband can take your child to see his family and SUPERVISE THEM the entire time.

Good job wanting to educate yourself. You should be proud.  VERY common. It\u2019s called echolalia, very interesting if you want to look it up. :)", "Echolalia is very common in autism. ( Sometimes it is used as a sentinel finding)", "Hi! My son\u2019s speech is like this - it can also be referred to as gestalt language processing. There are some excellent Instagram accounts I follow if you want more info!", "NTA. Until they can bring you the vile disgusting culprit None of them should see her. \n\nAnd even after that I would Not be leaving her alone with them for as much as a second.", "NTA. These people sound horrible and I wouldn't let them anywhere NEAR my child! What is wrong with your husband??", "NTA, CPS could take your daughter and it would be a battle to get her back. Does your husband really not see a problem? Does he think his family having access to her is more important then your two keeping your child safe in your custody?", "NTA. This is one of the most treacherous things you can do to a person. Whoever is doing this is not thinking about your daughter's wellbeing and obviously hates you. Unfortunately, your husband would rather be in denial than deal with this. You should keep your daughter away from all possible culprits until you find out who is responsible for this. Don't let your husband guilt you, this is about your daughter's safety and health.", "NTA. Supervised visits with family members only if able. Your husband is very in the wrong too for making you feel at all like a potential AH for being worried about how your child is possibly being manipulated. You are not keeping the child from bonding with the family, you are setting boundaries to protect not just you but your child from being manipulate. Start seeing it that way, as boundaries, \nand stop feeling bad for it. (btw I liked the suggestion of a nanny cam)", "NTA\n\nThat's scary", "Honestly her husband not being upset at this makes me think he is either in on it or said it himself. Gets the kid taken away without looking like the bad guy, otherwise he\u2019d be taking this far more seriously and giving hell to his family until they found out who did it.", "NTA\n\nYou have a husband problem. He should be standing with you on this, not putting his want of a relationship between your child and his mother over your daughter's wellbeing and your need to feel safe from his family actively working to endanger your child's stability.\n\nHere's a compromise. Install nannycams in every room of your house and do not allow MIL or SIL any unsupervised time with her, unless they are in your house.\n\nIf your husband resents you for keeping your child safe from his family's foolishness, then send him to live with them, and make sure that all of his visits are supervised, too.", "NTA, but it's also not your choice alone. You might be more effective getting him to agree to only supervised visits.", "What is wrong with your husband??\n\nNTA, he should be outraged.", "Not sure what country you\u2019re in, but if you have a case worker/csw, I\u2019d advise you to get in touch with them. They can assist you to get ahead of this and access resources to (hopefully) prevent this from going any further.", "NTA, but are you positive your husband isn\u2019t in on this? His lack of concern is disconcerting", "NTA. Your in-laws are actively endangering you and your daughter. That is the long and short of this. Talk to your husband very frankly about your concerns and feelings. If he invalidates them, you will know that you have a bigger problem on your hands.\n\nAlso, try to get a video of your daughter saying \"say mommy hurts me\". Any evidence you can start to gather of outside influence is going to be critical, especially early on before whoever is manipulating her starts to wise up with just how to teach your daughter these phrases.", "NTA.\n\nMy daughter does the exact same as yours.  She has a strong memory and reading skills but her speech is echolalia with some out of context.  She will recite sentences from books that she has read.\n\nIt is very, very easy for in-laws to teach this phrase to your daughter. This is a very specific phrase so it is obvious that someone is manipulating her.  Also, it is very easy for her to express these phrases anytime, anyplace.  And (there is no if) when she does, this would be treated very heavily due to historical abuse and murders of people by their caregivers.  I get a lot of notices my way.\n\nYour task is to ensure her happiness and success (her terms of success) and to protect her at all costs. \n\nSo yes, I find this concerning.  There is proof of manipulation because the echolalia shows it.", "What if she repeats that to the wrong person?That will get your family in a whole mess of trouble. No go. \n\nTell your husband to get a clue. Anybody that would do that with my child would never be allowed around her again. Your child being safe is way more important than someone\u2019s feelings, incl. your husband\u2019s. NTA", "NTA, protect your kid. Do they usually spend time with her unsupervised? What issues do they have with your parenting style?", "I would report this to her therapist and/or record this.  It seems to me that you are being set-up by your husband's family (and maybe him) to have your life miserably messed-up.\n\nAnd, I would tell your husband that because someone on his side of the family is doing this, she cannot visit his family without you being present.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but maybe this is something you should inform the therapist about? Idk, but to me this seems like something to be proactive about rather than hoping no one hears her say it. At the minimum, maybe she will tell the therapist who told her to say it if she will not tell you.", "i agree the hubby should be way more upset especially since this could escalate to the point the child is taken from the home.  that should be pointed out to both the op and husband", "Also, (I am in Canada so it may be different where you are) report these things to a trusted therapist. Get ahead of the game. It will all be written and if his family tries anything, it won't work for them. It keeps you and your daughter protected.", "There is a watch that is targeted to parents of autistic children.  It is expensive to have but it allows a parent to listen on and communicate with their kid.  I think it is called AngelSense.", "It happens quite a bit.  My daughter does echolalia.  She is grade school.age.  Her diagnosis is Moderate-Severe Autism with a Global Developmental Delay.  Some of her autistic peers do not do echolalia though.  It is a spectrum disorder.\n\nThe thing with my daughter's echolalia is that she will use it out of context so we are walking home from.school and she would say \"What colourful Easter eggs, Elmo said.  Dr. Elephant says that George's dinosaur needs a teeth cleaning.\" (A combination of Sesame St. and Peppa Pig) this can be mixed in with her vocal.stimm of the \"buzz\" which is \"eeeeeeeehhhhhhmmmmmmyeeeeee\" which is what she is doing right now or she will.try to use echolalia to make a request or communication.  However, echolalia has been a tool that she uses for language acquisition.  So now she echolalia, stimms, and has been able to make her own sentences for expression.\n\nHence, autism is a spectrum with each autistic having their own unique trait with some commonalities."]}
