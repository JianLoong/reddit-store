They are abusing your daughter by feeding her words that could get CPS involved and have her life turned upside-down. I would let them see her only at your house under supervision. They can not be trusted to act in your daughters best interest", "NTA that level of manipulation doesn't get better, they will continue to utilize her against you. I'm so sorry you're experiencing this.", "NTA. I work with sped kids and a lot of them are little parrots. You husband\u2019s family using you child as a weapon is disgusting on all the levels. I do think your husband should be more upset by this and shielding your daughter, which makes me question his involvement, but that\u2019s not part of the decision of a h or not.", "NTA. But you should make a record of this. I don\u2019t know what process would be best, but at least recording her with timestamps and maybe mentioning it to her speech therapist (the fact that she says \u00ab\u00a0say mommy hurt me\u00a0\u00bb, and not just \u00ab\u00a0mommy hurt me\u00a0\u00bb) as suspicious would be useful in case it repeats/escalates.", "NTA, keep her away from them", "Info - Why does your husband want his family to have your daughter? Because in the long run,  CPS will end up placing her with family ie his family.", "NTA, but your husband is if he isn't doing anything about this and still wants her around those people.", "NTA.  Honestly, were it me, I'd start videoing  your time alone with her. Becs if you WERE hurting her, there would be behavioral indications, even in \"normal\" interactions. And the absence of this indicator might help you in the future. I'd also talk to a social worker or atty for advice how how to deal with these family members.", "Omg so NTA! Does your husband even understand the gravity of this situation?! Your daughter is at risk of being taken away", "Trust your gut instinct, this could get really bad really quick. NTA\n\nFor grown adults to go out of their way to teach CPS trigger words to a kid, hoping the kid says it enough to get you in trouble??? Thats a huge deal. And if your husband is ok with this? I duno if I could trust him either, Im sorry. \n\nI dont think hes malicious persay. But hes your partner. And if hes not willing to see how dangerous this can get, than hes being very ignorant. And frankly, isnt helping. He should be talking with his siblings and mom, and helping set the boundary. \n\n\"You guys cant teach kiddo to say things like that. Its dangerous, mean spirited and absolutely not ok. And dont say, 'oh its a joke'. Its not a joke. Something of that caliber, is NEVER a joke. Would you all really rather kiddo be taken from us and put into the system? Out of spite for my wife? Your all ridiculous\"  IS the conversation he should be having with his family, but I digress. Good luck Op", "NTA I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this", "Hell no. You\u2019re absolutely NTA. They\u2019re trying to.. what exactly? Get your child taken away from you? They\u2019re messing with your life and your child. Keep that girl away as far as possible.", "INFO:  Have you discussed a compromise like no unsupervised visits?  Has your husband confronted his sister and mother about this?", "OMG, NTA!  Letting your child have a relationship with your husband's family is dangerous.  Can you imagine having CPS involved?  For your sake and your daughter's don't let them see her.  Your husband needs to understand that his job is to protect you and your child from harm, even if it comes from his own family.", "NTA \n\nI would not allow any visits, supervised or not. Sister is attempting to get your child taken from you and you in prison", "OP you should invest in some nanny cams. I've read stories of children being abused at daycare, school, etc and the parents put nanny cams in the backpack to find out who was doing it.", "NTA. Keep your daughter away from them. What apend if CPS go involved for something they do?? Your husband is an adult and can see them if he want, but they're no good people to be near your daughter.", "NTA Your husband is kinda selfish. Does he think one moment what will happen with your child if they take this serious? His family wants to hurt you so much that they give a fuck about what will be about your daughter, she is just a weapon. And he wants those people to see your daughter. What next? Hitting her blue and green and letting her say \"Mamma did\"? \n\nIt isn't that he has not your back, but that he doesn't want the best for his child.  It isn't the best for the child to see his family. If she is 4, she also doesn't really care so much. It is just him who wants that they are close or that he wants to give in what his family demand - even though he sees that they do such evil things. \n\nYou must start to document everything! Make a diary of what they do, if you have proofs, save them. It can be important for the future. And your child must be kept Way from the inlaws. If your husband can't accept this... i would rethink how this can work out in the future if he priotize the family over his new family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
