Maybe that's just the lack of stress that usually comes with suppressing visibly autistic behaviors (which is part of masking), but it has both a calming effect and gives a minor dopamine boost (at least, I assume that's what's happening because it causes a surge of happiness AND a minor boost to my executive functioning - I also have pretty terrible executive dysfunction due to ADHD so even a minor boost is noticeable).\n\nOP, if you see this, I'd like to also add that I'm glad you're protecting her. If you need any additional resources, the autism self-advocacy network has a lot of good stuff, and avoid autism speaks like the plague, they're basically the PETA of autism. Stay away from ABA, as the autistic community widely sees it as equivalent to conversion therapy - even more so among autistic queer people (like me! :D) if that tells you anything about the validity of the comparison. \n\nRather than just teaching her how to appear \"normal\" as she gets older, teach her to recognize when it's important to follow social conventions and why, and when they can be looser or even ignored. These are the things I wish I had known growing up. If she ends up a \"gifted kid\", as many autistic kids do even if they experience delays in early childhood, strongly encourage her to prioritize not burning out over excelling. A really bad burnout can cause extreme trauma and be disabling for years, or even decades, and is truly not worth any level of achievement.\n\nSome of these things may not be relevant, but if you ever want the perspective of an adult autistic person with a high level of self-awareness (due to nearly a decade's worth of skills developed in weekly therapy) and a decent amount of self-education on variations in experiences on the spectrum and subsequent needs, feel free to DM me.
