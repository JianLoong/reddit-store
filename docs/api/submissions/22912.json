She doesn\u2019t respect you or your things. She does not view you as a friend. \u201cGiving you a life lesson.\u201d By breaking something that she knows means a lot to you.

You'll probably never see them after high school anyway and they don't respect you.", "nta\n\ndo not be friends with her. not only over this blush thing, but she just clearly does not respect you/your feelings?? you asked her to respect your things and because she didn't get what she wanted she just BROKE it?? and she kissed your boyfriend behind your back thinking that everything was okay! AND she refuses to apologize for any of these things... she is acting extremely selfish and immature\n\nbeing young does not mean that she gets to act on every whim without consequences, she is 15 which is old enough to know that breaking other people's things and kissing other people's boyfriends are wrong.", "Nta. She's trying to justify using your expensive makeup by guilting you into it. When that didn't work, she damaged it to punish you even though she knew it was sentimental to you. She taught you a good life lesson but not the one she wanted. Abusive people get cut off.", "NTA and so many red flags. This person is NOT your friend. She sounds jealous of you (kissed your boyfriend!?!) And now she destroyed something expensive and cherished by you. And now she is turning your friends against you? This is evil behavior and you would do well to back out of this before it escalates bigger.", "NTA. Not your friend. J.E.A.L.O.U.S.", "It is that big of a deal. It was not an accident.  She deliberately destroyed something that she knew was precious to you. Same with the boyfriend.  This is a pattern of behavior, and she is NOT a friend. Keep her blocked. NTA", "NTA-  Ugh. It's like when parents on school yards demand that any toy brought by a kid to the playground **must** be shared with every other kid, especially even if the other kid isn't being nice.   \n\nThat wasn't a gift for her it was a gift for you and its only crime was existing in your bedroom while you had her as a guest in your home.  Your friendships are friendships.  Not some alliance in which you make trades like a zombie apocalypse and even then- if someone destroyed things like beauty products as if you were denying her a supply of penicillin. It's not an unspoken agreement that friends share each other's stuff nor are they reasonable to have an \"If I can't use it, you can't either.\"   \nYou don't even need a deep sentimental reason like the fact that your grandmother gave you it: it's your personal belongings.   \n\nAs for the boyfriend, unless you had explicit boundaries discussed with *him* that he can kiss other girls or even kiss your friends- he cheated.  That's a betrayal of trust from him AND the so-called friend who decided to do that behind your back.  That's not a \"what she doesn't know can't hurt her\"- she is hiding that she can't be trusted.\n\n  \nNow since you're both kids: I'm wondering what would happen if your parents were brought into this situation.   This wasn't some accident. It was deliberate and while in the end, sure it's just stuff, kids need to be taught there are consequences. You could leave the consequences at simply cutting ties but I'd say your parents could make her parents aware and that they expect her to be held accountable.  \n\nLastly, I get that you're all kids and you're figuring out what's a big deal or what isn't but if your friends can't grasp that she's wrong then they're not on your level about what you expect. I hope you find better people to spend time with, to be comfortable welcoming into your home, to enter romantic relationships with you, to trust with personal parts of your life: everything a good healthy friendship can include.", "NTA. Get better friends, that's what you do.", "NTA. That girl is not your friend. She doesn't care about you. Please cut her off.", "NTA. Ditch this girl.", "I agree she sounds jealous. I would drop her. I find your other friends strange for saying that her maliciously breaking something precious to you is not a big deal?! Do they know what really happened or do they only have her version?", "NTA. She did a malicious thing deliberately. She is not your friend. She will act friendly towards you, and you can be cordial, but don't let her near your stuff again.", "NTA- it\u2019s a huge deal, she came into your home and disrespected you and things that are important to you. If she doesn\u2019t understand that then she is not your friend. Keep her blocked,  tell your other friends that if they can\u2019t respect that decision, they can move on and then you can to move on.", "Sharing make up causes blemishes and other skin problems. Make up is NOT to be shared!", "It\u2019s the fact you kept talking to her after she kissed your boyfriend. That was stupid.", "NTA. She and your \"friends\" who are siding with her are major A Hs. Find better friends.  Better means kinder, more respectful.", "NTA but was going to say a bit childish. Then I saw you are 15, so that's fine lol. Didn't read the wall of text, just the title.", "NTA The curse of being sentimental in a world full of clods. However from her perspective telling the story you're super petty.
