I've met them and they are not good kids. I've told her to stop talking to them but she refuses and tries to go behind my back.\n\nFor these reasons (among others), her father and I have decided that we are not going to let her go off to college as long as she's a minor under our care. This means that she won't be going in fall ~~2025~~ 2024 because she doesn't turn 18 until that December. I am not trying to stifle her, but I do want her to be safe.\n\nShe was recently talking about starting to fill out college applications and I told her not to bother. I explained that we weren't letting her go until she's old enough to make that decision for herself. She started crying and yelling at me but I refused to budge.

You think she's going to be the only 17 year old freshmen? Hint: I was one.\n\nBut beyond all that- you are holding your child back in a way that could potentially keep her behind her peers for life. There is a reason why people go right into college and why its always more difficult for those who are \"going back \" to school- The loss of knowledge and the studying skills that occurs is real.\n\nI highly suggest you reconsider OP.

If you don't think your daughter is ready to move away from home and live independently, then fine - but you should be talking positively with her about how she should further her development - both academic and social. Perhaps it's right for her to do her first couple of years at your local community college, and then transfer. \n\nBut it sounds like your daughter's real problem is that her friend group are assholes. In that case, going away to college (and away from these friends) might actually be good for her.

But I do know in situations like this looking for validation on the internet won\u2019t help, and it won\u2019t change the ultimate outcome.\n\nRegardless of how good your intentions may be, your little daughter is growing up. Trying to hold her back will only inspire distrust and make her distance. She will start hiding things from you (if she hasn\u2019t already) and instinctively resist your advice, even when you are right. Moreover, she probably can\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so scared for her, and to be honest, most likely no amount of explaining will get it through. It sounds like you\u2019ve already realized this yourself but steam rolling over her person is not the same as guiding her or protecting her. And she would be correct not to see it as such. In that light, to her you are controlling and restricting, unreasonably so. \n\nListening to your post, I\u2019m reminded of the story of Rapunzel from Stephan Sondheims into the woods. In the play she escapes from her mother, who locks her into a tower to protect her from the outside of the world. Her child is na\u00efve, easily influenced and unable to think for herself. But it\u2019s only because she never had a chance to learn what the world outside was like and struggle for the sake of herself. In the end after running away Rapunzel dies an inconsequential death, and the man who knocked here up is nowhere to be seen. Her mother, heartbroken renounces the world. The irony is that perhaps if Rapunzel hadn\u2019t been so sheltered from the world, she would\u2019ve been able to see the danger as it came. \n\nIt sounds to me like you screwed up, and she hasn\u2019t had a chance to learn how to live in the real world yet. Now that you\u2019re panicking, it\u2019s too late to get extra time to teach her. At best, you need to sit down with her and have an honest frank discussion on why you want her to stay home for an extra year. After all, going to college at 16 is early. But you cannot force her to stay, or, rather, you cannot force her to stay without deepening the rift in your relationship. \n\nIf you truly love her, then let her go. Let her experience what it means to be a young adult. She cannot learn what it lives means to live life at home. Rebuild the trust you\u2019ve broken by being controlling. Be there to catch her when she falls, and give her advice when she\u2019s unsure and a warm place to come home when she screws it all up. If you don\u2019t you may loose her in the end anyway.", "A year working would have benefited me prior to attending university. Does she know what she wants to study?\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s too young to go with her peers; I\u2019m more commenting on the benefit of working prior to attending to focus mind on why you go to college.", "Since she is so smart, I hope she gets a scholarship and leaves you behind.

I explained that we weren't letting her go until she's old enough to make that decision for herself. She started crying and yelling at me but I refused to budge.

Or you could ask her how she could demonstrate this year that she is mature enough for college, and offer to revisit the decision at the end of her senior year of high school.  Maybe she could be an exchange student (living with a family acting in loco parentis ). In other words you could have framed the situation so much better. \"Hey daughter, I love you so much, and want you to be successful. College is so expensive these days. It is a huge financial risk to send someone to college who isn't ready. Therefore your father and I are going to give you two choices. Option one is you take take a gap year to do XYZ. College is a very different environment than high school. It will be more difficult than it needs to be for you to go away to college before you reach the age of majority and have your expected graduation before you will be of legal drinking age. If you choose the gap year option option, we parents will provide \\[type of financial support for college\\] under the following terms and conditions. Alternatively, you can go to your local community college next year. You can cover your tuition by taking Federal student loans and working. Of course you will live at home for free. If you meet these clearly laid out terms and conditions for your freshman year, your father and I will provide the following types of financial support for years two through four under these terms and conditions.\" In addition, it is now more important than ever to provide your daughter opportunities where she can grow.

Maybe the reason you think she isn\u2019t capable enough to make adult decisions on her own is because you act like a helicopter parent with a penchant for moving the goalposts to justify when you disapprove of her own choices.

Staying at home and delaying her studies will virtually ensure that these problematic friends occupy an even larger place in her life completely defeating the stated purpose of delaying her educational opportunities.

What exactly does \u201cnot exactly from a good part of town\u201d mean? Oh, no, how dare your kid be friends with Poot people, right? YTA, you are stealing your daughter\u2019s independence, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019ve also stolen and lost any kind of a good relationship with her, too.", "I hope she goes NC when she's 18.", "The contradiction is sending a 4 year old to kindergarten because it's more convenient not to have her at home, but not allowing a 17 year old to go to college because you want to control her life longer when she's a very normal age to attend.", "i mean, clearly the daughter did succeed in school, but there\u2019s actually many studies that children who go into kindergarten younger than their peers are at a disadvantage. at that age, a few months can mean the difference between a child being placed into gifted classes or falling behind their classmates. like, if the cutoff for the daughter\u2019s class was january 1st, i am very confident that the majority of children born in january outperformed the majority of children born in december because of how much of a difference that can make.  \n\nhere\u2019s a [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/01623737028002153) + i recommend reading outliers by malcolm gladwell as there\u2019s a very good chapter that covers it.", "We have a winner! Denying her access to college does NOT make her safer or less likely to get involved in dangerous situations with less than desirable people. If anything, it will push her towards a riskier life because she will become desperate to get away from OP. \n\nAsk me how I know! What they are doing is punishing her for being the way they made her. Way to send a mixed message. Smh", "I've worked with a lot of people who don't know what to do when they fuck up and just shut down.\n\nHelicopter parents need to understand that making mistakes is *important.* Everyone is going to. It's best to learn how to get back on your feet early.", "It depends... Are they influencing her to party and do drugs?  If it is a long those lines than yes, they absolutely have the right to make those decisions for her.  If they just think they are annoying or don't like the way they dress... That is another story", "Totally agree! OP sounds like they don't approve of anyone that's not identical to them and God forbid her kid goes to college and mixes with a diverse demographic...", "did i suddenly become a dog? because those whistles are LOUD", "Need to contact the Mods. Only one Mega Asshole title has been given once.", "Very appropriate.", "Exactly how I feel. Can my kid hang with yours please?", "Hi McPoyle, \nWhat you have done is amazingly difficult and impressive, and I\u2019m so proud of and happy for you!", "Probably all of the above.\n\nOP is a huge narcissist, it's like my mother wrote this post. The 7 years I was NC with that woman were the best of my life.", "Their parents are poor.", "They're *poor*... they live \"on the wrong side of town.\" So *obviously* that makes them bad people! \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude43 /s", "Move with her of course.", "And that 90 minutes probably doesn't feel far enough, amirite? \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Either earlier is good in both cases, or later is good in both cases. It's hypocritical to be fine with one but not the other.\n\nThe parents are terrible for delaying her college education, but there's nothing wrong with starting her in grade school sooner based on her birthday.", "And it will make sure she stays with her current friend group.", "You described very succinctly how I felt reading OPs question.  This is sad for all parties involved.", "Who was it?", "Some days, definitely not.", "They're absolutely not the same case; a 4 year old isn't going to be meaningfully contributing to the decision here, this is a place where if someone has to make the final call it's *reasonable* for it to be the parents. A 17 year old should be in charge of her own college admissions process, with her parent's support.", "You're against the parents for delaying her education as an adult, but you're also against the parents for accelerating her education as a child. Do you want her education accelerated or not?", "4 year olds and 17 year olds are different, I know it's a shock. \n\n\"You think it's bad to monitor a 17 year old at all times, but it was also bad to leave a four year old unsupervised? I'm sickened by your hypocrisy, do you think independence is good or not?\" \n\nCan do the same with letting a four year old choose all her meals vs controlling aseventeen year old's diet, or a thousand other examples. Outfis, swimming in the ocean, drinking alcohol, dating seventeen year old... just turn off the Hypocricy-Alarm and think about it for five seconds."]}
