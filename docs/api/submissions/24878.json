My daughter has a late birthday (early/mid December), so she is going into her senior year of high school. She is a very smart girl and I'm proud of what she's accomplished. But she's also young and naive in a lot of ways.\n\nShe's easily manipulated. She doesn't pay much attention to her surroundings. She can't stand up for herself. She constantly still calls or texts myself and her father for help with things.\n\nMore recently,  I've also been concerned about her doing dangerous things or submitting to peer pressure from her 'friends'. I've met them and they are not good kids. I've told her to stop talking to them but she refuses and tries to go behind my back.\n\nFor these reasons (among others), her father and I have decided that we are not going to let her go off to college as long as she's a minor under our care. This means that she won't be going in fall ~~2025~~ 2024 because she doesn't turn 18 until that December. I am not trying to stifle her, but I do want her to be safe.\n\nShe was recently talking about starting to fill out college applications and I told her not to bother. I explained that we weren't letting her go until she's old enough to make that decision for herself. She started crying and yelling at me but I refused to budge. I don't think I'm being unreasonable and honestly her reaction is more evidence of immaturity. But apparently she texted her Aunt who has been calling me an asshole. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: fall 2024, not fall 2025.\n\nEdit 2: people seem to think that I will not allow her to go to college at all. I am absolutely willing to let her go to college once she's 18 and we will pay for it, wherever she wants to go (we have the means).", "created_utc": 1692298018, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tw0mv/aita_i_told_my_daughter_not_to_bother_applying/", "score": 6170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You think she's going to be the only 17 year old freshmen? Hint: I was one.\n\nBut beyond all that- you are holding your child back in a way that could potentially keep her behind her peers for life. There is a reason why people go right into college and why its always more difficult for those who are \"going back \" to school- The loss of knowledge and the studying skills that occurs is real.\n\nI highly suggest you reconsider OP.

If you don't think your daughter is ready to move away from home and live independently, then fine - but you should be talking positively with her about how she should further her development - both academic and social. Perhaps it's right for her to do her first couple of years at your local community college, and then transfer. \n\nBut it sounds like your daughter's real problem is that her friend group are assholes. In that case, going away to college (and away from these friends) might actually be good for her.

But I do know in situations like this looking for validation on the internet won\u2019t help, and it won\u2019t change the ultimate outcome.\n\nRegardless of how good your intentions may be, your little daughter is growing up. Trying to hold her back will only inspire distrust and make her distance. She will start hiding things from you (if she hasn\u2019t already) and instinctively resist your advice, even when you are right. Moreover, she probably can\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so scared for her, and to be honest, most likely no amount of explaining will get it through. It sounds like you\u2019ve already realized this yourself but steam rolling over her person is not the same as guiding her or protecting her. And she would be correct not to see it as such. In that light, to her you are controlling and restricting, unreasonably so. \n\nListening to your post, I\u2019m reminded of the story of Rapunzel from Stephan Sondheims into the woods. In the play she escapes from her mother, who locks her into a tower to protect her from the outside of the world. Her child is na\u00efve, easily influenced and unable to think for herself. But it\u2019s only because she never had a chance to learn what the world outside was like and struggle for the sake of herself. In the end after running away Rapunzel dies an inconsequential death, and the man who knocked here up is nowhere to be seen. Her mother, heartbroken renounces the world. The irony is that perhaps if Rapunzel hadn\u2019t been so sheltered from the world, she would\u2019ve been able to see the danger as it came. \n\nIt sounds to me like you screwed up, and she hasn\u2019t had a chance to learn how to live in the real world yet. Now that you\u2019re panicking, it\u2019s too late to get extra time to teach her. At best, you need to sit down with her and have an honest frank discussion on why you want her to stay home for an extra year. After all, going to college at 16 is early. But you cannot force her to stay, or, rather, you cannot force her to stay without deepening the rift in your relationship. \n\nIf you truly love her, then let her go. Let her experience what it means to be a young adult. She cannot learn what it lives means to live life at home. Rebuild the trust you\u2019ve broken by being controlling. Be there to catch her when she falls, and give her advice when she\u2019s unsure and a warm place to come home when she screws it all up. If you don\u2019t you may loose her in the end anyway.", "A year working would have benefited me prior to attending university. Does she know what she wants to study?\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s too young to go with her peers; I\u2019m more commenting on the benefit of working prior to attending to focus mind on why you go to college.", "Since she is so smart, I hope she gets a scholarship and leaves you behind.

Or you could ask her how she could demonstrate this year that she is mature enough for college, and offer to revisit the decision at the end of her senior year of high school.  Maybe she could be an exchange student (living with a family acting in loco parentis ). In other words you could have framed the situation so much better. \"Hey daughter, I love you so much, and want you to be successful. College is so expensive these days. It is a huge financial risk to send someone to college who isn't ready. Therefore your father and I are going to give you two choices. Option one is you take take a gap year to do XYZ.

It will be more difficult than it needs to be for you to go away to college before you reach the age of majority and have your expected graduation before you will be of legal drinking age. If you choose the gap year option option, we parents will provide \\[type of financial support for college\\] under the following terms and conditions. Alternatively, you can go to your local community college next year. You can cover your tuition by taking Federal student loans and working. Of course you will live at home for free. If you meet these clearly laid out terms and conditions for your freshman year, your father and I will provide the following types of financial support for years two through four under these terms and conditions.\" In addition, it is now more important than ever to provide your daughter opportunities where she can grow.

My brother\u2019s birthday is in December and he did not go to montessori. My parents decided to enter him into kindergarten a year early because it fit their working schedules better. My brother graduated HS at 17 and and started college at 18, and seems to be infinitely more stressed by the whole concept despite being closer to home & not in dorms.

I honestly believe at 19 I was a lot more prepared for the world and for what college wanted from me than I ever would have been at 17. Adding in mental health struggles, more time is always better in my opinion.

He feels he missed his chance to make sports teams in his freshman year cause he was small, and by the time he sprouted he didn't make teams due to coaches having greater investment in the kids who might be able to play their full school careers. He did also end up playing some sports at a very high level in his later teenage years, so its not unrealistic that his growth/size was a factor in missing out in early competitive years", "I read a study in college that argued that being older rather than younger has much better outcomes overall, as the children are more emotionally and intellectually developed, setting them up for success.", "At most, she\u2019s 17 for about four months if her birthday is in December which is totally normal for a lot of college students.", "Yes, people who couldn't afford tuition at a 4 year school are all deadbeat criminals /s", "Ugh, I'm sorry she said that to you and that you can relate at all.

You don\u2019t have to accept student loans if they\u2019re offered.", "If they truly can't afford it, the expected family contribution (EFC) will be zero, and the student will be offered Pell grants (which never have to be repaid) and work study (literal jobs on campus, working for the university, that allow the students to study and do their school work at work) to cover thousands of dollars of the tuition, before they even have to take anything out in federal student loans. Currently, students can receive $7,395 a year in Pell grants and earn $7,500 a year in federal work study awards -- that's nearly $15,000 a year they never have to pay back. __*But they can only get that money if their parents are willing to fill out a FAFSA -- the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.*__\n\nBefore parents have to pay a penny for college, dependent students can take out their own federal direct student loans, __*as long as their parents are willing to fill out a FAFSA.*__ The amounts vary by year in school: freshmen can borrow up to $5,500, sophomores can get $6,500, and juniors and seniors are eligible for $7,500. Out of those amounts, all but $2,000 of the loans are *subsidized* -- meaning that no interest accrues until the student has been out of school for 6 months.\n\nNo payments have to be made on any of these loans until students have been out of school for at least 6 months -- and if a student hasn't found work within those six months, or if they become unemployed at any time after starting repayment, they can apply to put the loans in forbearance for up to a year. Interest will still accrue, but they won't be penalized for not making payments.\n\nStudents also have the option of choosing income-based repayment plans for their student loans. The newest plan requires just 5% of the student's annual *disposable* income (the difference between 155% of the federal poverty level for their household size and their adjusted gross income, minus their living expenses, standard deduction, taxes, and employment expenses) divided into 12 monthly payments per year. They could literally end up with a $0 monthly payment on their student loans, and after 20 years, any remaining balance will be completely forgiven. If they go into public service, their loans will be forgiven after just 10 years.\n\nAfter alllll of that, parents have the option to cover all of the remaining expenses of a student's college education with a federal direct Parent PLUS loan. Those loans, like federal direct student loans, can be deferred upon request of the parent until 6 months after the student has left school. Any and all Parent PLUS loans can be consolidated into a Direct Consolidation loan after the student has left school, and then they're eligible to be repaid through an income based repayment plan.\n\nSo no, \"I can't afford it\" is not actually a valid excuse to refuse to sign documents giving your child permission so they can get federal student aid and pay for their own education.\n\nAffordability also isn't even an issue OP raised, so I'm not sure why you felt the need to make this response.

She stopped her high risk behaviors, she cut back on some of the illicit substances she'd started with her old friends (mainly alcohol, nicotine, and vaping weed...but I think there were one or two other less savory things too!)\n\nShe actually ended up realizing that she didn't really have anything in common with those friends anymore, that she'd grown while they'd stayed stuck, and she ended up completely cutting ties by the time she started her junior year. She just realized that they didn't fit into each other's lives anymore, really.\n\nThis girl would realize that too, if she were given the chance.

She was very smart, both academically and socially, so we decided to go for it. (Plus, financials came into play as well-- it made a big difference financially to pay for another year of daycare.) She's currently making her way through elementary school with awesome grades, and living her best life. It's possible she would do \"better\" had we waited, but I feel like she would've been bored to be a year older in the grade. \n\nIn general, the best advice is usually to wait, but you can ask the school about your specific questions.

We\u2019re both lawyers (both attended very mid-tier schools) who were by far the youngest people in our law school classes. We\u2019re lucky as hell.

Some kids are held back a year.", "I'm sorry your father said those things to you. I've gotten the same from both of my parents since they started divorcing when I was 14/15. My father had shitty things to say about my mom pretty much my whole life and undermined her as a parent by doing things like telling me I didn't have to listen to her and telling me to keep secrets from her. At some point, when I was 15 or 16, he was refusing to pay the court ordered child support and alimony after the divorce, which left us hungry and struggling since my mom had been a SAHM for so long and was javing major problems finding work in the recession. He told me over the phone, \"You're a snake just like your mother. All you care about is money.\" Says the asshole who always spent everything he made on himself to the point of bills getting behind and causing overdraft fees every month, and who at various points threatened to sue my mother for having the audacity to make sure the household bills (pre-divorce) were paid or daring to spend any of 'his' money on dental or health care for me or herself, who would also spend my mother's entire paycheck as well back when she was still working based on his assessment that he deserved it since she made less than he did.\n\nEver since I was 14, when his affair and everything broke out and my parents started divorcing, I've been basically forced into the role of my mother's marriage, divorce, and life therapist. It's been nearly 22 years since that started, and it's still more or less all she will do with me, just venting and bitching about everything that's ever gone wrong in her life and her marriages and with my dad's family, stuff going back as much as 60 years that she bitterly hangs onto like grim death. Almost everything we watch together and even the most inocuous surface level conversations will be something she relates to some shitty thing in her past, and it never matters how many times I try to redirect conversations away from it or tell her I remember it or even when I go out of my way to show her how much I remember the stories I've heard it 10+ times before by telling her stories to her before she can finish retelling it to me, it just keeps going on and on. It's exhausting and emotionally draining. So, of course, this means I've heard for 22 years allllll about how terrible my father is, and she has counted and recounted all the ways in which he is terrible over and over and over. We used to have a lot more fights until I started grey rocking her more, and one thing she loved to say in more heated moments was that I'm just like my father, usually in response to something like me not agreeing with her or holding an opinion different or opposed to her own. I already had a terrible self-image and abysmal levels of self-esteem, so to hear her repeatedly equate me with this objectively awful person was always just a sucker punch.\n\nShe genuinely wonders why we are not closer and blames me for it. I don't stoop to her level and choose not to say such calculated and hurtful things, but I have tried desperately to get her to see how she has hurt me over the years and explained how I feel whenever she says or does X or Y, and how it results in me not feeling safe to talk to her or feeling so low I want to die, and she always DARVOs me and turns it back around on me somehow. Only her feelings and perceptions are correct. I have even told her directly, these were my thoughts when such and such event happened and was why I behaved the way I did, and she would literally tell me no and tell me what I was *actually* thinking at the time, which would be just so vile and horrible, and moments like that made me realize she honestly thinks I'm that terrible of a kid/person. It was in moments like that that I realized how much she must absolutely hate me because I didn't turn out like a little clone of her or that I wasn't always a perfectly obedient child robot. I wasn't even a bad kid, just damaged (mostly because of her, but never mind that..) and anxious and depressed and had a hard time coping with my parents' divorce and all the shit she started dumping on me constantly, all while trying to get through high school alive. I never did drugs or drank or snuck out and never got in trouble of any kind, so aside from not graduating high school on time, I was hardly that bad... but she always thinks the worst of me and my intentions. She hates anything about me that isn't something she would do, like, or think. And it hurts so much that she can't ever just see me and love me for who I am as her daughter, or ever put aside her own preferences or opinions to experience the things I enjoy with me. God where is this all coming from. I'm sorry.", "Also, using her *totally normal age-appropriate* reactions against her. I turned 18 in the spring of my senior year of high school. If my parents had told me not to bother applying to college, because they wouldn't let me go, you bet your ass I would have been screaming and crying. Hell, there was screaming (on both sides) when I told my parents I was going to major in music, and not language arts like they wanted.", "I once had a friend who had parents like that and needless to say their relationship was ruined for a good few years and said friend did some reckless and life-threatening shit because they weren't allowed to do just about anything.
