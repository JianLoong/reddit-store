We never really have an issue with his doing this as long as he gives us a heads up before coming.\n\nThis issue occurred this past weekend when my husband and I were going out of town for my brother and his wife\u2019s baby shower. We have 3 dogs and since BIL has a key we asked if he could watch the dogs (take them out/feed them) for the weekend in exchange for him staying at our house. Some backstory is BIL doesn\u2019t have an actual place of his own and floats between staying at their other brother, sister, or moms house. He agreed to watch out dogs and stay in our guest bedroom\n\nWe have a ring doorbell and can confirm that he stayed at our house this weekend because our camera shows when he arrived, went to work, came back etc\u2026 but when we returned home we found that it looks like our dogs were completely neglected all weekend.\n\nOur dogs have a section of the house they normally stay in which was covered in poop, dry water bowls and empty food bowls (one of our dogs doesn\u2019t each much and when we get home from work there is normally at least one dog bowl that has barely been picked at throughout the day)\n\nI told my husband that I feel like we were used for our house and BIL to use it to eat and sleep but he didn\u2019t do what he agreed to. My husband agreed and called BIL only to get hung up on and none of our questions answered. \n\nWe decided to leave it be, clean up the mess and take care of our dogs and bring it up again when things calm down. Today I get a notification from our camera that BIL arrived at our house. I text my husband to see if he knew that he would be stopping by to which he replied no, that he was not told he would be coming.\n\nI am debating telling my husband to confiscate BILs spare key but I also don\u2019t want to cause any issues with his family.

He is not doing things he has agreed to and he is disrespecting your boundaries. This is not someone you want to have a key to your house.", "NTA. He\u2019s abusing the trust you put in him when you gave him the key. Once the trust is betrayed, it is more than acceptable to take the privilege away.", "NTA. He stayed at your house and didn\u2019t take care of your dogs as promised and then didn\u2019t give you a heads up he would be stopping by as per your previous agreement. I would change the locks because if you ask for the key back he might go make a copy to try and pull one over on you. Then give out keys later as needed. But make sure he knows he\u2019s no longer welcome to use your place as a break room or crash pad for naps. Let him over for family events (as long as he behaves) but cut off access to your home for a long while till he improves as a person. Good luck.", "NTA, he didn't do what he agreed to do. Though, I'd also look into changing the locks", "NTA have a talk with your husband. Don\u2019t do anything unless you both agree to take the key away. But your BIL has shown he doesn\u2019t respect you guys he shouldn\u2019t have free access to your house.", "NTA. Dude had 1 job and messed it up. I\u2019ll take the key. Dude can eat in his car.", "Nta. Tell him to give you the key back, he could have ended your dogs.", "NTA.\nHe agreed to something and then didn't do it. He also agreed that he would give you a heads up when he was coming by. He didn't. That's two strikes. \nYou certainly should take his key. He broke the agreement you had for its use. You're not the one starting drama; your BIL is. Ask anyone who tries to start drama when they're going to give BILa key to their place so he can crash there. \nAt 22, there's no reason for him to not have his own place.", "You should have reacted with more intensity. Let it go too long and your husband and his brother won\u2019t think much of it. In reality you are not an asshole but in this situation you should have been. If it was me, I would have sent him to the hospital.", "NTA. You'd have been within your rights to call the police when he entered your house without permission.\n\nYes, do talk to your husband. You both should have removed his access when he totally neglected your dogs.\n\nChange the locks. Taking the key back removes only one copy from him. Unless you have high-security locks that require a card for permission to duplicate, you can't be sure how many keys BIL has or now many he might have given out.", "Yeah at the moment BIL hung up on your husband with none of your questions answered, the BIL made it quite clear that he doesn't respect your home or his access to it. If that call by your husband hadn't taken place I would say 'make sure you talk to BIL and get things cleared up' but that attempt was made and because of the way it ended there is no further need to attempt civility. Change the locks. Asking for the key back would result in weeks of maybe getting it back, maybe not, followed by the definite uncertainty of whether he's made a copy. Change the locks and watch for future attempts to access your home. Might need to call the cops if multiple attempts are made. Lot of red flags here.", "YWNBTA. Not even close. You should straight up demand for  them to be returned. He neglected your dogs! That's just fucked up. If he can't find stable housing, that's not your problem and he can eat his lunch wherever. (Although I would like to know why he doesn't have stable housing).", "NTA. What is there to debate about?", "NTA. Change the locks", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
