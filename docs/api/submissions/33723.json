{"id": 33723, "submission_id": "18r1cgl", "title": "AITA for telling my grandma to just not come if she\u2019s going to complain?", "selftext": "My grandma flew in for Christmas this year (as did I). We are both guests at my parents house. I (23 F) know my parents try their best to make her stay as good and comfortable as possible. Apparently she had mentioned to my dad she was craving meatloaf offhand a few weeks back, and that is what my mom made her the first night she stayed!!\n\nSo anyways, cut to tonight. She drank the last of her favorite alcohol last night - Glen Livet. Now for as long as I can remember, my parents have gotten a bottle for her in preparation for her visit. I suppose this time they just forgot? Not sure. So as my dad is fixing her a beverage of some other alcohol, she turns to me on the couch and says all huffy \u201cI can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t get a bottle of glen livet for me\u201d. And I said \u201coh, I thought I saw a new bottle on the counter yesterday\u201d and she said (again all huffy) \u201cno, there was like half a drink left\u201d.\n\nIn response I say, \u201cwell geez we are all human, I\u2019m sure they just forgot\u201d. And her response was \u201cwell when they come to my house, I have all the alcohol for them\u201d and starts listing everything. And I say, \u201cI am sure it was just an oversight, how many times have they forgotten it before?\u201d She says \u201cI usually buy it\u201d (NOT TRUE. My parents usually always buy her a bottle.)\n\nSo I finally tell her that if she is going to complain like that, she just shouldn\u2019t come. I think it was a bit harsh, but I was taken aback by her ungratefulness and lack of empathy. This is just one example, but in general she seems to have the mentality that the world should revolve around her. She definitely was annoyed, and possibly hurt, that I said that, but she\u2019s always making comments like this every year and it finally got to me. To me, if I am a guest in someone\u2019s house, you don\u2019t get to complain about anything.

Grandparents who complain are annoying. But telling her to just leave is also pretty rude. Also because you sound like you treat her as just some random guest, when she\u2019s also your grandma. \n\nOur actions often reflect on the people around us. When you\u2019re rude to your grandma, it likewise reflects poorly on your parents as well as they\u2019re the host. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d appreciate you treating your grandma like that. At least in my culture, while a guest behaving poorly reflects badly on them, treating a guest poorly is equally bad and embarrassing for the host family.", "Man it's just so weird to me that booze plays such a big part and people's lives.
