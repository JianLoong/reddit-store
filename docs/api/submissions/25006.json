It doesn\u2019t work that way.\nMe: So are you suggesting that I\u2019m superior to you because my skin is lighter? Because that\u2019s wrong.

Yes, there are times and places for certain jokes, and they can be insensitive and ill-timed. But as far as I can tell, this one was innocent and okay. \n\nSecond, she clearly likes to play the victim card, and feels that it gives her power over others, and gives her the right to mediate what people are allowed to say or do, and if they don't do as she wants them to, she calls them racist and everyone is supposed to apologise and back down. To me that is the most heinous way to act, and it's bordering on evil. \n\nNow for clarification, this is not the same as undermining racism or to claim that it doesn't exist or shouldn't be addressed. This is misuse of a fear for being labelled a racist and being mobbed for it, and it's so incredibly counterproductive.\n\nEdit: me not type good..", "NTA and the USA has some serious problems when it comes to perceived racism and victim status - this thread a case in point.

Black skin cancer patients are around three times more likely to die from skin cancer diagnoses than their white counterparts, and that is mostly due, according to actual studies, to later-stage diagnoses (black patients symptoms aren\u2019t recognized by medical professionals until the later stages because of where skin cancer typically forms on black patients, and they\u2019re looking for the same symptoms as a white patient who will have the cancer show up just wherever)."]}
