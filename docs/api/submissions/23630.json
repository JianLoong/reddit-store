I am also skinny at 6ft 130lbs (this is relevant).  One of the venues we play regularly has a server, we'll call her \"Cassie\" (mid 20'sF), who's working most dates we play there.  She's cool, and we've been semi-friends since I joined the band about two and a half years ago.  We do joke around with each other and take part in non-flirty, witty banter and telling jokes or funny stories.\n\nOver the last 6 months she's referred to me as 'Scrawny' on three separate occasions.  One of those occasions was when I injured my ankle while loading in at that venue and it was significantly swollen by the end of the night.  I was sitting down, looking at my ankle when she walked by and I asked her if my ankle looked swollen to her.  She didn't really look and just said \"I can't tell, you're so scrawny!\"\n\nNow this past Saturday, as we finished with the gig and were loading out, I was walking in her direction as she was walking towards me.  When she got close I did one of those fake-lunging motions at her to make her flinch and I really scared her.  She kinda yelped, laughed, then walked up to the husband of one of the band members, who's also a good friend of mine, and gestured towards me saying \"That scrawny bitch over there almost made me pee my pants!\"\n\nGranted, I may be the AH for scaring her like that, but believe me, we both partake in little pranks like that on each other.  So when she was nearby shortly after that, I asked her in a no-attitude and non confrontational way \"Hey, why do you keep referring to me as scrawny?\"  Her response:  \"Well that's because you ARE scrawny!\"  I said:  \"Well its not MY fault you're fatter than me!\"\n\nYes, I purposefully said that, knowing damn well how that sounds.  No, she isn't fat.  AT ALL.  Not that it really matters.  But since it had been the third time she's used that term on me, unprovoked until this most recent time, I figured it was kinda the time to retaliate.\n\nOnce I said what I said, her face dropped and she responded with \"You rephrase that RIGHT now!\" I said: \"Uhh, no.\"  She walked away.\n\ninstead of continuing with how we resolved this, I figured I would just leave it as is and ask AITA?  Most people , including my girlfriend, I've told are on the fence and I've kinda lost sleep over this; I am NOT this kind of person, but sometimes I can go too far when I think I'm sticking up for myself.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1690885433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f8ivo/aita_for_saying_to_a_girl_its_not_my_fault_youre/", "score": 248, "replies": ["ESH \nYou could have avoided being an arsehole though by asking her to stop calling you scrawny first, instead you just escalated the situation.", "ESH.

You seem vindictive and she seems like she's terminally unaware that her words affect people.", "YTA.\n\nIf you asked her to rephrase her scrawny comment because it hit a nerve, would you want her to say \"uhh, no\"?\n\nA thoughtless, bantering, or reactive word is one thing, but she clearly told you you crossed a line with your comment and instead of apologizing as one should do with a friend they aren't trying to hurt, you doubled down on the intentional insult part.", "NTA.\n\nShe body shamed you, you returned the favor.

She fucked around and found out but you should have just told her to leave you alone instead of doing exactly what she's been doing.", "YTA I don\u2019t think you two are friends. I don\u2019t think she likes you at all.\n\nYou come across super weird and creepy to me", "YTA you ARE scrawny. If you're 6ft and 130lbs you are objectively scrawny. Doubling down on insulting her for her just describing you makes you an ass.", "YTA you are scrawny and she didn\u2019t say anything with malicious intent. Just because your feelings were hurt doesn\u2019t mean she did anything wrong. You shouldn\u2019t just asked her to stop.", "YTA it takes one second to say please don\u2019t call me that. Now after that I would definitely understand if she disrespected you and continued. \n\nY\u2019all had a friendly relationship which you blew up because you couldn\u2019t communicate", "YTA.\n\nShe's been flirting with you the entire time, and instead of busting her cheeks, you spazzed out on some butthurt childish ego shit.", "ESH.  She sucks for continually calling you scrawny.  This is body shaming.  You suck for your comment to her which to her sounded like you were calling her fat.  Body shaming...again.", "ESH. Two wrongs do not make a right.", "YTA - \u2018Yes I purposefully said that, knowing damn well how that sounds\u2019 You knew you were the AH before you said it", "ESH\n\nShe dished what she couldn\u2019t take.  No ones great here", "ESH sucks here. \n\nI am a firm advocate of sometimes people need to see exactly what they did to learn. You attempted to a good guy and broach the subject politely. She chose to ignore that and assume since you are a guy she can take shots at you that wouldn't appreciate back. You took the clear message she sent and taught her how it feels. \n\nSometimes, people earn the Ahole treatment they get. She fits this 100% for me. If you do want to be the better person perhaps try to sit and take a minute to explain why you did and exactly how she felt is how you feel about what she did. Good chance for her to grow maybe. If not, atleast you will know and know she ain't worth talking to anymore.", "love how you weren't the bigger person, twice", "She probably only sees men as one ideal, big and muscular. So you don't fit in her world. So she feels entitled to insult you. You came to her in a serious way and expressed it bothered you and she doubled down with her ignorance. You gave it right back to her. Some people can dish it out but can't take the smoke when it hits them back.   If you want to clear the air, you can just tell her. You don't appreciate being called scrawny and you can both agree to leave body shaming as 'off limits', goofing around or otherwise. You would appreciate it.", "ESH. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say YTA, but at 37 yo you should be way above something this petty.

You\u2019re 36 but acting like a 20 year old, even the way you wrote this out feels immature. Grow up", "Yeah YTA but without harsh judgement- mainly because it seems her scrawny comments were part of this witty banter from her standpoint -  so you should've expressed to her that that bothered you- instead of retaliating.   You should have apologized and explained your reaction - ESPECIALLY with a fat comment.  Sometimes witty banter gets real.   Use your words for good brother, not harm.", "ESH.\n\nBut I saw you have a gf and you shouldn't be flirty bantering with another woman imo.", "YTA or ESH, I can't decide. Calling a man \"scrawny\" is off-limits to me, but you do say that the two of you have a banter-y type of friendship so she may have thought it was acceptable within the parameters. It's clear *now* that it wasn't, and you should have used your grown up words and said something sooner. Kind of like how she actually stuck up for herself when you crossed her line. I doubt the two of you are going to be friends anymore.", "ESH. Her comments are not okay, but you should have addressed it after the first or second time it came up, letting it continue on as part of this witty banter you claim to have with her and then escalating the situation with a harmful statement wasn't any better.", "Aww 3Esh. Wow you took it too far. You could have just as easily told her that you found it offensive & let her apologize;", "ESH  mild YTA to OP if you had a problem with her calling you that (which you should) you had the opportunity to say something to her and didn\u2019t. You decided to be passive aggressive instead. She\u2019s not your friend, she\u2019s an employee where your band plays, even if you are friendly and joke around. Also about the pranks, really?!? You\u2019re and adult and if someone did that to me I wouldn\u2019t have just flinched I would have retaliated in expectation of physical violence. If she reacted like that it\u2019s because she thought you were going to hurt her.  And calling her fat? Even if she\u2019s not fat and insulted you it is not a good look. That being said she\u2019s a HUGE asshole who obviously has some insecurities she\u2019s taking out on you. She sounds like the kind of person who will talk about you behind your back. Those things are not your problem to solver or feel bad about. You can\u2019t change that she is a massive asshole. Stay away from her she probably can\u2019t be trusted.\nI\u2019d be wary of what she said to the venue if she\u2019s like that she may be casting you in a bad light.\nAll that being said you could have been the better person and taken yourself out of the equation. The only things we can change are what we do and how we react.", "ESH. Kids playing with swords will eventually get hurt.", "NTA. Since when has being body positive been a girl only thing? I hate this culture we're in where women can be as cold cutting as they like with their remarks to men and can basically say or do anything negative they want. Yet men aren't allowed to show emotion (simp), not allowed to show masculinity (toxic), can't set their own bounderies (controlling), does the term double standards mean nothing anymore?!\nIf you can dish it out, you should be prepared to be served it back.

I didn\u2019t realize it would be insulting, part of it is that it\u2019s a bit complimentary for women. He pulled me aside and told me calling a guy skinny is like calling a girl fat. That hadn\u2019t occurred to me; I apologized and haven\u2019t done it since. \n\n\u2026 But that story is from when I was *sixteen* and we were in high school.

Literally once, all he had to do. There's no indication she was malicious about it, considering his own funny haha joke is to lunge at her he's clearly not sensitive all the time. If she's not stopping when he says to by all means, say shit back, but for Christ's sake strap on your big boy pants and try being an adult for a minute first. \n\nHow was she even to know this upset him?

The top result on Google is the one you quoted (Oxford English Dictionary), but about half of the first page has nothing derogatory in the definition and like many words the meaning can be different for different people based on experience.

She told him that she wasn't ok with it. \n\nShe thought they were joking around bc that's how he's described their relationship up to this point, and he's never said anything to show he wasn't ok with \"scrawny\". Plenty of people have healthy relationships that involve teasing, it's not an inherently bad thing. Considering he thinks it's funny to lunge at and scare her, it's not unreasonable for her to think teasing him wasn't a big deal either.
