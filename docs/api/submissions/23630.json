I am also skinny at 6ft 130lbs (this is relevant).  One of the venues we play regularly has a server, we'll call her \"Cassie\" (mid 20'sF), who's working most dates we play there.  She's cool, and we've been semi-friends since I joined the band about two and a half years ago.  We do joke around with each other and take part in non-flirty, witty banter and telling jokes or funny stories.\n\nOver the last 6 months she's referred to me as 'Scrawny' on three separate occasions.  One of those occasions was when I injured my ankle while loading in at that venue and it was significantly swollen by the end of the night.  I was sitting down, looking at my ankle when she walked by and I asked her if my ankle looked swollen to her.  She didn't really look and just said \"I can't tell, you're so scrawny!\"\n\nNow this past Saturday, as we finished with the gig and were loading out, I was walking in her direction as she was walking towards me.  When she got close I did one of those fake-lunging motions at her to make her flinch and I really scared her.  She kinda yelped, laughed, then walked up to the husband of one of the band members, who's also a good friend of mine, and gestured towards me saying \"That scrawny bitch over there almost made me pee my pants!\"\n\nGranted, I may be the AH for scaring her like that, but believe me, we both partake in little pranks like that on each other.  So when she was nearby shortly after that, I asked her in a no-attitude and non confrontational way \"Hey, why do you keep referring to me as scrawny?\"  Her response:  \"Well that's because you ARE scrawny!\"  I said:  \"Well its not MY fault you're fatter than me!\"\n\nYes, I purposefully said that, knowing damn well how that sounds.  No, she isn't fat.  AT ALL.  Not that it really matters.  But since it had been the third time she's used that term on me, unprovoked until this most recent time, I figured it was kinda the time to retaliate.\n\nOnce I said what I said, her face dropped and she responded with \"You rephrase that RIGHT now!\" I said: \"Uhh, no.\"  She walked away.\n\ninstead of continuing with how we resolved this, I figured I would just leave it as is and ask AITA?  Most people , including my girlfriend, I've told are on the fence and I've kinda lost sleep over this; I am NOT this kind of person, but sometimes I can go too far when I think I'm sticking up for myself.\n\nEDIT:  I do accept being the {bigger} jerk in this scenario.  And for the record, not long after that interaction both Cassie and I talked and apologized to one another and things are just fine.  However, calling each other names or making mean comments was never really a part of the dynamic between ANY of us (us band guys or bar staff), and I guess where I grew up, scrawny was never anything less than an insult, so I didn't think I'd actually have to establish boundaries with words like that.\n\nAnd me 'lunging' at her, yes that was stupid, I won't deny that, but some of the comments regarding that are just nuts.\n\nAnyway, I will definitely learn from this and use my words for more good than harm.  I am not the creepy/asshole/weirdo some of you said I was.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1690885433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f8ivo/aita_for_saying_to_a_girl_its_not_my_fault_youre/", "score": 1223, "replies": ["ESH \nYou could have avoided being an arsehole though by asking her to stop calling you scrawny first, instead you just escalated the situation.", "ESH.

Did he say he does that specific thing all the time to random women? Or even other female friends? I don\u2019t think so. Get your holier than thou ass outta here, woman. What\u2019s \u201clow tier\u201d is labeling someone over a harmless joke and assuming he does that specific thing all the time, tErrORiZINg women cause he gets off on it or something. People often go out to get scared, there are tons of places who\u2019s sole purpose is to accomplish that. They\u2019re friends doing pranks to each other. She laughed too. She never once expressed distaste for it, that\u2019s all in your fairy tale head. Calling someone scrawny all the time isn\u2019t a prank or even a joke. It\u2019s just body shaming. You\u2019re picking at something that wasn\u2019t even the issue and ignoring everything else to make your irrelevant argument. Get over yourself and wake up to reality.

People can die from being too skinny just like they can die from being too fat.", "It's not a competition though. No one should be commenting and joking about other peoples bodies like that. I have always had a lean build, but before I put on muscle in highschool, I was called every type of teasing name you could call someone for being skinny, by peers, crushes, friends, and adults. I can't comment on being on the heavier side because I never have been, but I can say, the feeling I felt likely would've been the same. People commenting on my size and weight, throwing around I need to eat more and \"bulk up\", making me feel as if something was wrong with me for my body type. \n\nAgain, both are shitty, doesn't matter if one is worse, they **both** are insults that can deeply effect people negatively", "Lmao. I didn't say it's the -only- type, now did I?

If she can\u2019t handle being called fat when SHE ISN\u2019T then she has no business shaming others for the way their bodies ACTUALLY ARE. Imagine this comment section if a man was repeatedly calling an actual fat woman fat and then she snapped and called him scrawny once (he\u2019s not even scrawny). \n\nI\u2019m familiar with her personality type and it sucks. Kind, compassionate, reasonable people don\u2019t turn mocking others appearances into social currency. It just doesn\u2019t happen, especially as adults.

I've been watched in school cafeterias to make sure that I don't eat and don't immediately go to the bathroom! People started making rude comments about my skinny legs and frame when I was 8 yrs old!
