I am also skinny at 6ft 130lbs (this is relevant).  One of the venues we play regularly has a server, we'll call her \"Cassie\" (mid 20'sF), who's working most dates we play there.  She's cool, and we've been semi-friends since I joined the band about two and a half years ago.  We do joke around with each other and take part in non-flirty, witty banter and telling jokes or funny stories.\n\nOver the last 6 months she's referred to me as 'Scrawny' on three separate occasions.  One of those occasions was when I injured my ankle while loading in at that venue and it was significantly swollen by the end of the night.  I was sitting down, looking at my ankle when she walked by and I asked her if my ankle looked swollen to her.  She didn't really look and just said \"I can't tell, you're so scrawny!\"\n\nNow this past Saturday, as we finished with the gig and were loading out, I was walking in her direction as she was walking towards me.  When she got close I did one of those fake-lunging motions at her to make her flinch and I really scared her.  She kinda yelped, laughed, then walked up to the husband of one of the band members, who's also a good friend of mine, and gestured towards me saying \"That scrawny bitch over there almost made me pee my pants!\"\n\nGranted, I may be the AH for scaring her like that, but believe me, we both partake in little pranks like that on each other.  So when she was nearby shortly after that, I asked her in a no-attitude and non confrontational way \"Hey, why do you keep referring to me as scrawny?\"  Her response:  \"Well that's because you ARE scrawny!\"  I said:  \"Well its not MY fault you're fatter than me!\"\n\nYes, I purposefully said that, knowing damn well how that sounds.  No, she isn't fat.  AT ALL.  Not that it really matters.  But since it had been the third time she's used that term on me, unprovoked until this most recent time, I figured it was kinda the time to retaliate.\n\nOnce I said what I said, her face dropped and she responded with \"You rephrase that RIGHT now!\" I said: \"Uhh, no.\"  She walked away.\n\ninstead of continuing with how we resolved this, I figured I would just leave it as is and ask AITA?  Most people , including my girlfriend, I've told are on the fence and I've kinda lost sleep over this; I am NOT this kind of person, but sometimes I can go too far when I think I'm sticking up for myself.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1690885433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f8ivo/aita_for_saying_to_a_girl_its_not_my_fault_youre/", "score": 46, "replies": ["ESH \nYou could have avoided being an arsehole though by asking her to stop calling you scrawny first, instead you just escalated the situation.", "ESH.

But you could have just told her you don't like that and it makes you feel bad. I don't think she ment anything bad by it.\n\nYou response though was deliberatly mean.

What I'm saying is, you could have approached it without deliberately trying to hurt her feelings.\n\nPersonally, I think everyone should mind their own business and keep all comments about other people's bodies to themselves.

If it was okay for her to talk to you in that manner then it's absolutely okay for you to shame her right back. As far as scaring her you literally said that you guys banter that way with each other so I'm assuming that it's something she would have done to you as well. So I wouldn't worry about it and if she's going to be all in her feelings then maybe she should think about how she made you feel", "ESH \n\nLook You are an AH not for replying in the same manner necessarily, but you did so even though you know how bothersome that type of comment is before you even tried telling her it is bothering you. So for not expressing your discomfort and jumping right to an offensive defense, I would say small AH. \n\nShe's a plain AH even if she did not realize she's doing something potentially hurtful towards you she should be \"ok, fair enough I get your point and won't do it anymore, sorry for until now\" instead of being a hypocrite and sulk.\n\nso you're like 1/10AH (+4/10 petty) and she's like  2.5/10 AH", "NTA.

But geez dude, couldn't you just ask her to be the bigger person?", "NTA for the very simple reason that if you can't take it, you don't dish it out.\n\nShe's the one who set the parameters on what you can call eachother, you were merely following her lead.", "Edit reread and changing to YTA \n\nLunging at women to scare them is a massive creep move, don't do that shit in future;\n\n it's not funny it can trigger people and if you do it to the wrong person you'll end up maced or punched in the throat by someone who thinks they're being physically attacked 'again' it's not funny unless you find making women uncomfortable funny \n\nFat shaming someone is also gross behaviour too especially the way you describe \" well I'd decided it was time to retaliate\" ICK.. But mainly I'm disturbed by the \"haha I tried to scare her as a joke\" bullshit- cut that right out op", "ESH. She can dish it but not take it. Being fat is worse than being skinny in our society though.", "NTA.\n\nIf she can\u2019t take it she shouldn\u2019t be dishing it out.", "NTA, it can really knock someone when they keep getting told their underweight or scrawny or tiny etc. Yoh didn\u2019t say she was fat, you said she\u2019s fatter then you - after her doing this repeatedly, I can understand why you snapped. \n\nNext time try \u2018body shaming me again are we?\u2019.\n\nPeople think that because it\u2019s calling you slim or small or (in the past I\u2019ve had) \u2018stick\u2019 like, that it\u2019s ok because it\u2019s not fat shaming.

If hurting her back was your goal, as opposed to just drawing a boundary against being called scrawny.  Like an adult.  \n\nWhen a relationship includes banter and light insults, communication of where the line is the first time it\u2019s crossed is even more important, because once you\u2019ve laughed about it and allowed it, it becomes part of the standard repertoire", "ESH\u2026.she was wrong but a mature healthy way to communicate that is to remind her that body shaming at every size is wrong and that it hurts your feelings when she says that. You have no idea her history of body image and weight and if she\u2019d had an eating disorder or medical condition this would really be bad to say. I\u2019d apologize for HOW you communicated but say the truth part which is skinny people can be insecure too and you wouldn\u2019t ever walk up to someone who is obese and tell them that to their face, you don\u2019t do that to a skinny person it\u2019s the same. Also doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s friend material she sounds immature", "YTA because you knew damn well what you were doing. You can stick up for yourself without being an AH or retaliating", "Damn\u2026 6ft 130lbs? That\u2019s is stick skinny. I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d and usually 210 but been as low as 180 and everyone thought I was unhealthily skinny at the time.", "YTA. You could have just said it bothered you.", "YTA\n\nYou could have said that you didn't like her calling you that and told her to stop. Instead, you aimed to hurt. While she definitely isn't in the right, maybe she would have apologised and stopped. Never know now.", "ESH for the same reasons as other commenters. You're 37 years old. You should know by now that if somebody does something you don't like you have an adult conversation with them and tell them hey I really don't like that you call me scrawny. Please stop. She's a grown woman and should not be calling people names in the first place especially if she saw that it was making you uncomfortable. If you want to maintain a friendship with this person, I would sit down and talk to them. If not, just continue to go about your business.", "NAH I don't think either of what you said was that bad. Just talk to her and apologize if you feel bad about it. Make sure to let her know you don't like being called scrawny.", "She was using an adjective you found insulting - even in a joking way, I don't think it's ever appropriate to regularly comment on someone's body, especially negatively like this - so she's TA for doing so.\nBut unless I missed something, you never specifically told her not to or talked to her about how it made you feel. Instead, you made a conscious choice to be petty and insult her in response, and didn't recant or apologise when she immediately let you know it wasn't okay.\n\nESH, but leaning a bit towards Y.T.A", "YTA\n\n\nShe's not a mind reader. All you had to do was act like an adult and have a conversation about how you felt about being called scrawny.
