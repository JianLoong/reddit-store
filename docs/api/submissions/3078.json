When she asks you about flowers, meal plans, decorations, etc. just tell her something else. That way if she does try to copy you it won\u2019t work and you can always say you and your fianc\u00e9 changed your minds. You could also idk talk to your best friend?? Why do you call her your best friend if you can\u2019t even have a conversation about why she\u2019s getting married so suddenly, and why she\u2019s putting up with Kayla\u2019s competitiveness? If she was a true friend you should be able to have that conversation with her, and if she\u2019s not, why would you invite her in the first place? Don\u2019t feel bad about uninviting someone who can\u2019t even be truthful to you, and especially if you feel that they are going to make you feel even a tiny bit stressed on your wedding day. You don\u2019t want negativity on what\u2019s supposed to be one of the happiest days of your life.", "Ugh, NTA, and not a \"best friend\" if everything has to be an upstage show to ruin your events.", "NTA I would also uninvite them. They might even make a scene just to make your wedding \u2018worse\u2019.", "NTA. Your wedding and you get to decide who goes.

Is this your \u201cbest friend\u201d?", "NTA. But tbh I don't have high hopes for that relationship if they're getting married just so they can have a (one-sided) wedding competition with you.\n\nHave you talked to Sara about what's going on and if she's okay? Because if she's your bf then you should be able to discuss it with her, and if Kayla is pressuring her to get married/compete with you she might need someone to talk to/advice.", "If she\u2019s hiding the date of her wedding from you, are you even invited to her wedding? NTA either way but it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s planning on inviting you", "NTA \n\nThis is a huge event for you, and these young ladies have already hijacked your wedding by deciding to get married too, and to do it a week before you.  This is as bad as it gets.  I would move on from these two.  But as far as the wedding, it is completely okay to uninvite them.  They are trifling and trying to steal your thunder.  I might tell them its too complicated with both weddings being planned and occurring so close together, I need to focus on my wedding and the other wedding is a distraction, so I cannot attend the other wedding and I would prefer you not attend my wedding ceremony as there is only so much thunder to go around in a short time.  Lets keep them separate and clear so we both can live out our dream weddings.  If things get contentious, I would explain how they were hijacking my wedding and engagement, that I didn't appreciate it, and reinforce that I would not attend their wedding and they are not attending mine. I would also explain that I know when their wedding was planned and it was highly disrespectful to set a date of a week before.  It's super tough when you are facing something like this with a best friend.  I tend to be a little more direct.  I might say, 'I don't know your intentions but it feels like you're stealing my thunder, and its very stressful planning a wedding.  I'm going to focus on me and my wedding.  I hope your wedding plans and such go well and you are super happy, but I'm going to go my own way and focus only on my wedding.  I would prefer you and Kayla not come to my wedding.  It feels like you're copying me and 1-upping me, and I'm not going to allow that.  Even if its purely coincidental, I need to be separate from your plans and ceremony, while you are separate from mine.  Lets not get in each other's way. Best of luck!\"\n\ntl;dr: NTA - they are hijacking your moments and stealing your thunder while disrespecting you.", "NTA, please update us. I am curious if you fed false info to them like one redditer suggested.", "NTA she's jealous and living through you for some reason", "You\u2019ve a couple of options, reorganise your wedding to a date either much closer or much further away from that date. \n\nObviously don\u2019t tell her or anyone who would tell her. \n\nWhen she asks about your planning, just go nuts saying you\u2019re doing this that or the other that\u2019s completely opposite to what you want. Use your hubby to be as the excuse\u2026 oh yes, we changed our minds because fianc\u00e9 wants this or that. \n\nUninviting her is the kinder option but if you organise your wedding for after hers, invite her and let her see what you really did. You can even tell her that you didn\u2019t tell her so her gf wouldn\u2019t copy this aswell.", "NTA at all.  This friendship should be cast aside.  Try to focus on forming friendships with people who have stronger personalities so they don't let themselves be controlled by others, and don't try to one-up everyone around them.

Kayla clearly has some kind of fixation and hangout with outdoing you and Sara is going along with it. Either way, it's not worth engaging with it. be vague with future questions or even lie. Maybe they'll copy you and prove the fixation, what ever that fixation may be...\n\nMaybe because you're her gfs girl best friend or the fact that she is older than you? or her disdain for your fiance? Whatever her  hangup, its strange and you're right to not want that energy at your wedding.
