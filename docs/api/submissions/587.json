My teacher got mad at the class and kept us in for 5 extra minutes. Usually I wouldn't care but I was already having a bad day.

I sat outside next to the building where my last classes were and my friend asked if I wanted to Han gout at her class. I told her I didn't want to walk all the way across campus and then have to walk right back, but if she wanted to go then I would see her tomorrow. Remember I'm already irritated enough as it is. She then tells me that I don't need to take my annoyance out on her. This upset me because I felt like she was trying to make the situation about herself. I wasn't taking anything out her. I was simply trying to calm myself down. So I asked if she wanted me to take my annoyance out on her. She said no and I replied with, \"Okay, I'm not walking all the way across campus, if you're leaving then I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.\" More things were said but I can't remember them at the moment.
