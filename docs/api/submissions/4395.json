It would be best to see them first and slowly bring in the kids if the situation goes all right.\n\nI think she is making a mistake, but if she does decide to take them, I at least hope things go well.", "NAH. I can see both sides. But there\u2019s really nothing you can do if she\u2019s set on this. You can\u2019t make her stay or physically prevent her from taking the kids. You can separate of course but even then it\u2019s be too late for the court to intervene and the court would almost certainly let her go with them regardless. You may as well make the best out of it.", "Nta. Your wife is picturing a Hallmark movie, while this reconciliation could be an episode of Jerry. You're right, she needs to verify this medically induced \"change of heart\" on her own first.", "NTA, they haven't been interested in her life for 10 years, and then she gets an invite that's not even directly from them but from the cousin? She hasn't been there in awhile and should definitely find out if it's going to be a hostile or passive aggressive environment before bringing children into the picture. It would be different if she went on her own first for a little scope out on whether they had indeed grown to accept her. My assumption is that if the dad is terminally ill they want her around for support and are \"grit your teeth and bare it\" with the LGBT thing, which would definitely lead to passive aggression and bitter comments.", "NAH. Can you and your wife go to meet them without the kids before Christmas? So you can feel out whether it would be a good environment for your kids?", "INFO: Are you actually not allowing her to go if she's going to go anyway?", "NTA\n\nThey have not been in contact in 10 years. They still have not contacted wife direct, but through a cousin. Do we even know if they truly want her there or is cousin trying to patch things up? \n\nThe first step should be wife alone. Children should not be brought into the fold until evaluating whether the environment is still toxic. Then it should be OP and wife visit, then children. \n\nJust because it\u2019s the holidays does not mean the environment is not toxic. All it takes is a small amount of time for trauma to occur. What if the parents are not remorseful and start railing toxicity while children are present?", "YTA.\n\nRegardless of your job, this might be the last time she, and the kids, can see her father while he's alive. If she wants to try and reconcile before he passes, that's her decision. And, seeing family, even a toxic one, for one trip isn't going to harm the children unless it's a physical abuse situation, and, you would think if it looked like it would turn into that that she would take her and the kids and leave. Right? So, yeah, right now, she needs your support, not another fight on another front.", "NTA. Because you want to protect your kids. You offered to bring them at a different time. \n\nJust my speculation. Could it be that wife is scared to go alone so bringing kids as buffer?", "NTA. Your being a protective mom. I came from a very similar background and my wife was in full ninja protect mode at my dads funeral. Protect those babies.", "This is all too sketchy. Why didn't her parents reach out directly? Are you even sure they want this? Why does it have to be on Christmas -- couldn't your whole family or just your wife go this weekend, or next weekend? If these are the final weeks of her father's life, time is short. Can you do a Zoom call as a family? Why can't your wife go alone? Can you discuss boundaries with your wife and make sure she has an exit plan if she does take the kids? Everyone seems to be very dug in to their position, and I think you need to be more open and creative to come up with a plan. NAH, except for your wife's awful family. And maybe they've learned something in the last ten years. A lot of people have.", "NTA - You are not an asshole for not wanting to bring your children into a potentially toxic environment. It is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of your children and to make decisions that are in their best interest. You are not suffocating your wife by being on call, it is a responsibility you agreed to take on months ago. You are not responsible for her family's behavior and it is not unreasonable to want to protect your children from harm. It is also understandable that you are not able to drop everything to accompany her in this situation.", "NTA if your wife wants to put herself back in a toxic situation that's one thing, involving your kids is another.

Always err on the side of caution in regard to the children. If she wants to gamble with her own mental health, she is free to do so. Her family has already proven to be homophobic.

Your wife is behaving like a willfully gnorant, petulant child.", "Your wife is a grown ass woman, so you need to trust her that she would remove your kids if it became toxic. You\u2019re denying them a chance to have an opportunity to meet their family.", "YTA I understand your concerns but I don't see hownone christmas could turn that traumatic for the kids. But you take away the chance to meet their grandfather. Also if your wife visits them and you work, who spends christmas with the kids? Or would your wife be required to not visit as well. Sure things with the family can go sour and it is a one time chance for your wife she seems to desperately hope for. If the time frame is what it is there won't be much chances to slowly reconcile and see how they kids might take it or how the family behaves.", "YTA. \n\nI get that there\u2019s history there. And if your reasoning was that YOU wanted to spend the holidays with the kids, I\u2019d be inclined to go N T A. \n\nBut you\u2019re going to be working. You are also letting your wife know that you don\u2019t trust her judgement or ability to walk out of a bad situation. \n\nInstead of focusing on whether to go or not. How about you both focus on building her self esteem, her courage, and her ability to walk away quickly from a toxic family situation. If things get bad, she has the power to pack up and leave with the kids. Also something to discuss with them a bit up front. \n\nYou\u2019ve got a chance to give you kids something potentially nice and special and instead, you\u2019re showing that you have no trust in your spouse.", "YTA.

I get your concerns but why don't you trust your wife to make sure the kids are ok?", "YTA. It\u2019s not your family. You can\u2019t make that call. How dare you tell her no to see her own family, even with that past. That is beyond controlling and selfish. This could be her only chance and you just say no?!

BUT it doesn't sound like there's a lot of time left with her father dying of cancer. I would hope that you would trust your wife enough to know that she would remove your children from any situation in which she thought they were unhappy or in danger.", "YTA, this is probably not a \"check and see for next time\" situation and this is important to your wife, it really outweighs the risk it might cause your kids. Also, why are you not telling your work that you have to cancel, your FIL is about to die and again this is clearly important to your wife. Also also, whose going to watch the kids then? I agree that this seems manipulative because now she has to second guess even going to see and potentially reconciling with her parents, which, again, seems really. important. to. your. wife.

I am thinking maybe you and your wife could speak to her parents via a video chat function beforehand so you can at least get to meet them and have a clearer picture as to what they seem like as people at present. Also, could your wife and kids book a room at a nearby hotel, so that they have an escape plan just in case things did turn sour and they don't need to rely on the parents for accommodation (which could be used as a power trip). It would be a shame to deny your wife the chance to say goodbye to her father and let your kids build a relationship with their grandmother if she has genuinely changed for the better.

At least right now with all the tension.", "Well whenever I suggest we should be cautious regarding this situation my wife tells me I'm being pessimistic and that this is a special situation etc.\nWe have a lot of resources for looking after kids at home because we both work and go on dates together etc so we have sitters, a nanny and a whole system. We don't have that back in her hometown, and even she wouldn't leave kids with any of her relatives. I suggested she should go alone first, and I'd fly the kids over myself over the day and return at night if need be. But as I mentioned she goes back to telling me I'm being pessimistic and all when I bring this up.", "Maybe you offer the following. I assume you have a *few* days off at some point in the next month. Meeting the parents and seeing the kids do not have to be on specific holidays. Especially if dad is sick. Sooo offer to use a few of your days to travel together to see the parents. Quick limited contact for your partner. You control the narrative. If the parents behave with your partner - offer for them to see the kids the second day and then return home.\n\nYou would be supportive - because your partner may face total PTSD if they treat her poorly and caring for the kids would be hard for her. She will need you for comfort and child care. If the parents are tolerant then a few hours the next day won\u2019t be bad.", "So who will have the children when she visits her family if you are on call?", "My parent's disowned my brother when he came out as gay. He and I went NC with them for a very, VERY long time. There came a time when they decided to try and reconcile with him over it. Did it always go well? No. But, they at least TRIED. \n\nAs for the kids?\n\nYeah. Not only were my parent's bigots, but also racists. By your \"OMG we must protect the kids from someone saying something bad or they'll grow up wrong\" I MUST have grown up just like them? Right? Except, I didn't. You know why? Because kids make up their own minds as they grow up. Simply seeing, or hearing something, especially on ONE trip, isn't the traumatizing experience people today think it is. It takes being subjected to it, by family, friends, society, to really shape a kids mentally for or against something. Not ONE trip.\n\nIn this case, the kids see the side with OP and her wife. Seeing the bad side, in one trip to see her dying father, isn't going to suddenly traumatize the kids. It will make them ask questions, which, getting the answers from OP and her wife WILL help shape them in the future, hopefully, for the better, as they learn what is good, right, and what is wrong.", "So, you had to respond to my post to tell OP you believe she's NTA why?", "Can concur, one single interaction with my mother as a child has caused lifelong trauma.  I'm nearly 40 and going through EMDR therapy and it's looking like a CPTSD diagnosis.  Never underestimate how badly abusive people can fuck a child up.", "Kids are influenced by many factors; society, family, friends. They have already been around OP and her wife. They've seen that side. Being subjected to the other side will make them ask questions, no doubt. Why are they like that? Why did they say that? But, traumatize a kid? No. Harm a kid? No. This is the kids seeing it for one trip with that family. Seeing good and bad is something you experience throughout your entire life. It's better that they see it young, get the questions out, and answered, when the answers help to show it's wrong as they are still trying to figure out who they are and will help them grow up to be better people.", "Also having the kids there probably makes your wife feel like she has an anchor to stop her unravelling. She cannot let herself feel the brick wall of 10 years NC, the pain that led to estrangement, her dad dying, the years of homophobia impact and Christmas combined if she has to get snacks and ask where wee Johnny\u2019s hat is.\n\nIt is unfair of her to use the kids like that but honestly as a queer estranged woman my advice is you will \u2018win\u2019 the battle here not by arguing right or wrong but listening and doing the battle plan together. \n\nFirst up logistics. You are on call. If you get called and she is away who takes the kids? Solve that to each parent\u2019s comfort and she may not want or need now to take them. But if you are on call, have no other childcare then she has to take them or not go. Discuss childcare and use it to probe if she is using them as a buffer. Discuss that if so.\n\nAnd bear this in mind, she knows logically her family are homophobic horrible people but humans are built of a need to belong and no one no matter how much therapy and work and willpower they have is immune to moments of such deep emotional belonging they don\u2019t wobble on things like deathbed apologies, Christmas bringing families together and that your parents will finally love you even via your kids one day especially on this last chance saloon.\n\nYou see her family are manipulating so of course you fear for the kids. She probably knows it and is ashamed, conflicted and confused what to do. I am estranged (my mother called armed police when she found out I was queer for context) and I have never regretted it. I went to therapy and processed years of PTSD level trauma and was healthily detached but aware \u2018oooh what when someone dies? Will I fall apart?\u2019 I have no contact with either side of my family.\n\nBut I was pretty confident. The pandemic started and that made me think yup, pretty family proofed. Then I had a freak life threatening illness in lockdown. I was told I had a strong possibility of not making it through that night. I emigrated. I was not allowed visitors (not Covid, the hospital were just being homophobic about my GF. We can\u2019t marry. Not legal in either home country.)\n\nAnd I wanted to call my mum. My mum who called the cops, who abused me. I didn\u2019t want her comfort. I wanted her to know if I died. I wanted to say things I never thought I would have need or change. I wanted my family to be aware on my deathbed the harm they did. I didn\u2019t have any of their numbers. I actually started digging through my block list. I realised I still hadn\u2019t felt resolution and you cannot pre-empt how death, births, marriages hit you in estrangement. Of course I assumed they would be dying first\u2026\n\nI did not call. Clearly I did not die. I also didn\u2019t tell anyone that I had been so thinking of my family my abusers not my loved ones at that moment. I still haven\u2019t told my GF because she would think I was forgiving them, doubting the estrangement, opening things up again. In fact I was opening up the grief that they will never change and their abuse can never be changed. I was connecting with it not rationalising and I couldn\u2019t explain. But it did actually shift far more trauma than therapy. In the two years since I shed so much that others told me would be the wrong way but I knew was a gut instinct, finally making me central in the family and it let it go properly. I had done the work to have it ready but often it takes an ending or start to really really do it not reorganise it a lot.\n\nYour wife may need to do things you will never understand to resolve herself about this. You can discuss safe sane consenting ways the kids come into that but you may need to trust her that she is doing something that actually takes back control from controlling people. Trying to dictate how someone gets a sense of autonomic control after abuse is a fight that just activates more need to scrabble for control. People push harder as it floods the same systems with more people.\n\nSet boundaries if needs be like not funding them a la we do not shop at the Salvation Army. Say you can only talk through stuff like gas, mileage etc if her insistence triggers the hurt you feel at their homophobia reaching you. Work out priorities, ultimatums and dealbreakers but generally just understanding that she\u2019s in a spiral because this is the moment she has to let go of hope every single unloved unaccepted child has their whole lives will probably free up most of the bickering by listening and empathising.\n\nShe\u2019s grieving her dad dying, the milestones that will never be, never were and the family she never had or will. It is complicated grief and it\u2019s incredibly common in abuse survivors and estranged people. They are heavily shamed for still wanting a happy ever after despite having the bravery to walk away physically. It\u2019s really painful when you are shamed for still wanting love from people who harmed you. This is why I never tell people I get sad at Christmas about my family. They always do absolutes. I\u2019m just sad. It will pass. It doesn\u2019t mean going back. Neither does actual grief when an abuser dies.\n\nEstrangement is a bereavement and it comes in waves. Death estranges you all over again and it is lonely grieving anyway. Estranged people often never have the societal understanding they grieved the living and are now expected to hate the dead. The opposite love is not hate, it\u2019s indifference. And the human mind is not wired to be indifferent around death. You are a neurologist. You know how the brain works. Don\u2019t expect your wife\u2019s brain not to interact with her heart.\n\nYou can support her at distance and your own level of comfort but right now NAH. YTA if you do not take the privilege of being not turned upside down and use it to support your family unit as the level headed but not coldly logical one.", "As I and you said \"might\". I would assume the wife to leave instantly if something like that was said. They will have probably somehow talked with their kids about things like that anyway as sadly this can happen in school etc as well and often does. You cannot protect your kids from the whole world or every asshole. \n\nIt's sadnif it happens but won't likely cause eternal trauma. Also I would assume the wife to be a responsible parent and act in her kids regard.", "thank you, i\u2019m surprised at all the \u201cwhat could possibly go wrong\u201d responses saying op is the ah. i agree with OP in that wife should test the waters first, maybe they have changed and if so that\u2019s great! but there\u2019s no way to know first without seeing for herself and i think it would be so awful if the kids had to witness homophobia towards their mom from their own family, even if she is able to defend herself and remove themselves from the situation. at the end of the day a parent\u2019s priority should be about the kids and their safety and comfort, and i don\u2019t think it\u2019s guaranteed here. hoping for the best, as it is a difficult and sad situation.

My best friend and his family live close to us and I can either leave kids with them or I can arrange for their nanny to be home during the days that I'm on call.", "It hasn\u2019t occurred to you that people aren\u2019t just worried that the kids will \u201cgrow up wrong\u201d? They are worried that horrible bigots will *do something* to the kids.", "Because i wanted to also awnser you.", "Did you actually think this was a \u201cthese people have different opinions\u201d situation? \n\nOP is clearly concerned because the parents were abusive.", "I'm deeply sorry that you went through all this. Thank you for sharing this deeply personal experience. I wish you all the best in every aspect of your life. I'd like to sincerely thank you for your kind words. It will surely help me personally and many others who needed to hear this.", "Her dad is dying. He may have weeks left, according to the post. Do yoi think she will really leave if things get really bad?", "Thank you! Someone finally understands what I\u2019m saying! It\u2019s about the kids. You don\u2019t want your kids to have to see you fight for a right to be a part of the family that doesn\u2019t want you. And OP said in a previous post she had asked her wife to meet in a neutral place with the family before the holidays so test it out and her wife said no so.", "\u201cI\u2019m not racist, I know a black guy.\u201d See how that sounds. Exactly the same. Also, those kids do not know those people. Op does not know those people. All she knows is that the abandoned their daughter when she came out to them. That\u2019s it. Why on earth would OP be okay with people she\u2019s never met, who are cut off her wife a decade ago, being around her kids? You\u2019re telling me if your wife\u2019s family cut her off for 10 years and then came back and said \u201cwell dads dying so this is as good a time as any\u201d you wouldn\u2019t be wary? You wouldn\u2019t want to protect your kids from that?", "You\u2019re making assumptions.

That means that if something happens she will be called, but other than that she will be with the kids on Christmas.", "A call does nothing. Op had previous post which said that she had ALREADY asked her wife to meet with them before Christmas (without the kids) to really see how the family is and if they\u2019ve changed and the wife said no.

She made one for herself and ultimately if it comes down to it, she\u2019s gonna do what she has to do to keep her kids safe and if that\u2019s not letting them around a bunch of known homophobes then so be it.", "That\u2019s great to hear. I honestly feel so bad for the wife. Even though she\u2019s been estranged from them, I\u2019m sure she still loves her family. I hope everything works out for them all.", "No, I\u2019m pretty sure they will experience trauma in life. That doesn\u2019t mean they should be put in traumatic situations by their own parents. There\u2019s a reason OP\u2019s wife hasn\u2019t spoken to her family in 10 years. \n\nOr do you think OP\u2019s wife should bring them around her homophobic parents to toughen them up or something?", "So if you get called out on Christmas day, your children won't even be with family but friends or a nanny. \n\nYour wife is likely not wanting to leave the children over the festive period, so could your relationship handle the emotional repercussions if her father dies without her and the children visiting at a time that suits you better? As rightly or wrongly, you have backed her into a corner to choose her children or her dying father. \n\n\nDo you not trust your wife to prevent your children from potentially being  harmed? Would she just sit there and allow them to harm her children? As that is basically what you are implying to your wife. Surely, if something were to happen, then she is smart enough to travel home or at the very least organise staying in a hotel to allow safe space to visit her father without staying with them for the time she is there.", "Good luck. It\u2019s bloody hard being the partner to an estranged person especially in the queer community. I wish it was more talked about in LGBTQ+ circles since it disproptionately impacts us and is such a balancing act between partners, friends and the community not to spread wider hurt in salving your own.\n\nBut glad I could help a little bit. Also it occurs to me if you don\u2019t celebrate Christmas could you shift Christmas for the kids to take the festive guilt trip off you two parents but keep Christmas joy for them? Like if its fully ripping the norms up, go all in on that? Age appropriate obvs and planned with your wife. It may lift some of her stress too. It\u2019s very likely she only intends to go back once btw not establish a long term dynamic so she might not want to remove the Christmas element if that is her one last chance thinking but an extra nuclear family Christmas is a back up plan.", "Yes, but I don\u2019t know, you don't know, op doesn't know.

People she doesn't know, and have made no efforts to know until now. Actual abusers, btw.\n\nI understand the concern, but boiling down a womans concerns over her children being exposed to people she doesnt know or trust that actively dislike their lifestyle as abuse is ridiculous and dilutes both discussing actual abuse and minimises the real impacts it has. Its not like she's stopping her partner going, she just doesnt trust abusive strangers with her kids like a normal, good parent.\n\nI think the problem is communication personally - that both are blinded by the emotions of their own perspectives and arent considering the others valid point's. Personality, I think the right call would be to have a zoom or skype call with the parents first or something to understand the situation better and decide how to proceed from there. \n\nAnd you minimising the trauma of homophobia and the environment it creates is ironic and gross.
