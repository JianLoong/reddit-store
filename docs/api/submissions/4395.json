I can see both sides. But there\u2019s really nothing you can do if she\u2019s set on this. You can\u2019t make her stay or physically prevent her from taking the kids. You can separate of course but even then it\u2019d be too late for the court to intervene and the court would almost certainly let her go with them regardless. You may as well make the best out of it.", "Nta. Your wife is picturing a Hallmark movie, while this reconciliation could be an episode of Jerry.

She hasn't been there in awhile and should definitely find out if it's going to be a hostile or passive aggressive environment before bringing children into the picture. It would be different if she went on her own first for a little scope out on whether they had indeed grown to accept her. My assumption is that if the dad is terminally ill they want her around for support and are \"grit your teeth and bare it\" with the LGBT thing, which would definitely lead to passive aggression and bitter comments.", "NAH. Can you and your wife go to meet them without the kids before Christmas? So you can feel out whether it would be a good environment for your kids?", "INFO: Are you actually not allowing her to go if she's going to go anyway?", "NTA\n\nThey have not been in contact in 10 years. They still have not contacted wife direct, but through a cousin. Do we even know if they truly want her there or is cousin trying to patch things up? \n\nThe first step should be wife alone. Children should not be brought into the fold until evaluating whether the environment is still toxic. Then it should be OP and wife visit, then children. \n\nJust because it\u2019s the holidays does not mean the environment is not toxic. All it takes is a small amount of time for trauma to occur. What if the parents are not remorseful and start railing toxicity while children are present?", "YTA.\n\nRegardless of your job, this might be the last time she, and the kids, can see her father while he's alive. If she wants to try and reconcile before he passes, that's her decision. And, seeing family, even a toxic one, for one trip isn't going to harm the children unless it's a physical abuse situation, and, you would think if it looked like it would turn into that that she would take her and the kids and leave. Right? So, yeah, right now, she needs your support, not another fight on another front.", "NTA. Because you want to protect your kids. You offered to bring them at a different time. \n\nJust my speculation. Could it be that wife is scared to go alone so bringing kids as buffer?", "NTA. Your being a protective mom.

Are you even sure they want this? Why does it have to be on Christmas -- couldn't your whole family or just your wife go this weekend, or next weekend? If these are the final weeks of her father's life, time is short. Can you do a Zoom call as a family? Why can't your wife go alone? Can you discuss boundaries with your wife and make sure she has an exit plan if she does take the kids? Everyone seems to be very dug in to their position, and I think you need to be more open and creative to come up with a plan. NAH, except for your wife's awful family. And maybe they've learned something in the last ten years. A lot of people have.", "NTA - You are not an asshole for not wanting to bring your children into a potentially toxic environment. It is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of your children and to make decisions that are in their best interest. You are not suffocating your wife by being on call, it is a responsibility you agreed to take on months ago.

Your wife is behaving like a willfully gnorant, petulant child.", "Your wife is a grown ass woman, so you need to trust her that she would remove your kids if it became toxic.

But you take away the chance to meet their grandfather. Also if your wife visits them and you work, who spends christmas with the kids? Or would your wife be required to not visit as well. Sure things with the family can go sour and it is a one time chance for your wife she seems to desperately hope for.

And if your reasoning was that YOU wanted to spend the holidays with the kids, I\u2019d be inclined to go N T A. \n\nBut you\u2019re going to be working. You are also letting your wife know that you don\u2019t trust her judgement or ability to walk out of a bad situation. \n\nInstead of focusing on whether to go or not. How about you both focus on building her self esteem, her courage, and her ability to walk away quickly from a toxic family situation. If things get bad, she has the power to pack up and leave with the kids. Also something to discuss with them a bit up front. \n\nYou\u2019ve got a chance to give you kids something potentially nice and special and instead, you\u2019re showing that you have no trust in your spouse.", "YTA.

I get your concerns but why don't you trust your wife to make sure the kids are ok?", "YTA. It\u2019s not your family. You can\u2019t make that call. How dare you tell her no to see her own family, even with that past. That is beyond controlling and selfish. This could be her only chance and you just say no?!

BUT it doesn't sound like there's a lot of time left with her father dying of cancer. I would hope that you would trust your wife enough to know that she would remove your children from any situation in which she thought they were unhappy or in danger.", "YTA, this is probably not a \"check and see for next time\" situation and this is important to your wife, it really outweighs the risk it might cause your kids. Also, why are you not telling your work that you have to cancel, your FIL is about to die and again this is clearly important to your wife. Also also, whose going to watch the kids then? I agree that this seems manipulative because now she has to second guess even going to see and potentially reconciling with her parents, which, again, seems really. important. to. your. wife.

At least right now with all the tension.", "Well whenever I suggest we should be cautious regarding this situation my wife tells me I'm being pessimistic and that this is a special situation etc.\nWe have a lot of resources for looking after kids at home because we both work and go on dates together etc so we have sitters, a nanny and a whole system. We don't have that back in her hometown, and even she wouldn't leave kids with any of her relatives. I suggested she should go alone first, and I'd fly the kids over myself over the day and return at night if need be. But as I mentioned she goes back to telling me I'm being pessimistic and all when I bring this up.", "Maybe you offer the following. I assume you have a *few* days off at some point in the next month. Meeting the parents and seeing the kids do not have to be on specific holidays. Especially if dad is sick. Sooo offer to use a few of your days to travel together to see the parents. Quick limited contact for your partner. You control the narrative. If the parents behave with your partner - offer for them to see the kids the second day and then return home.\n\nYou would be supportive - because your partner may face total PTSD if they treat her poorly and caring for the kids would be hard for her. She will need you for comfort and child care. If the parents are tolerant then a few hours the next day won\u2019t be bad.", "So who will have the children when she visits her family if you are on call?", "My parent's disowned my brother when he came out as gay. He and I went NC with them for a very, VERY long time. There came a time when they decided to try and reconcile with him over it. Did it always go well? No. But, they at least TRIED. \n\nAs for the kids?\n\nYeah. Not only were my parent's bigots, but also racists. By your \"OMG we must protect the kids from someone saying something bad or they'll grow up wrong\" I MUST have grown up just like them? Right? Except, I didn't. You know why? Because kids make up their own minds as they grow up. Simply seeing, or hearing something, especially on ONE trip, isn't the traumatizing experience people today think it is. It takes being subjected to it, by family, friends, society, to really shape a kids mentally for or against something. Not ONE trip.\n\nIn this case, the kids see the side with OP and her wife. Seeing the bad side, in one trip to see her dying father, isn't going to suddenly traumatize the kids. It will make them ask questions, which, getting the answers from OP and her wife WILL help shape them in the future, hopefully, for the better, as they learn what is good, right, and what is wrong.", "So, you had to respond to my post to tell OP you believe she's NTA why?", "Can concur, one single interaction with my mother as a child has caused lifelong trauma.  I'm nearly 40 and going through EMDR therapy and it's looking like a CPTSD diagnosis.  Never underestimate how badly abusive people can fuck a child up.", "Kids are influenced by many factors; society, family, friends. They have already been around OP and her wife. They've seen that side. Being subjected to the other side will make them ask questions, no doubt. Why are they like that? Why did they say that? But, traumatize a kid? No. Harm a kid? No. This is the kids seeing it for one trip with that family. Seeing good and bad is something you experience throughout your entire life. It's better that they see it young, get the questions out, and answered, when the answers help to show it's wrong as they are still trying to figure out who they are and will help them grow up to be better people.", "Also having the kids there probably makes your wife feel like she has an anchor to stop her unravelling. She cannot let herself feel the brick wall of 10 years NC, the pain that led to estrangement, her dad dying, the years of homophobia impact and Christmas combined if she has to get snacks and ask where wee Johnny\u2019s hat is.\n\nIt is unfair of her to use the kids like that but honestly as a queer estranged woman my advice is you will \u2018win\u2019 the battle here not by arguing right or wrong but listening and doing the battle plan together. \n\nFirst up logistics. You are on call. If you get called and she is away who takes the kids? Solve that to each parent\u2019s comfort and she may not want or need now to take them. But if you are on call, have no other childcare then she has to take them or not go. Discuss childcare and use it to probe if she is using them as a buffer. Discuss that if so.\n\nAnd bear this in mind, she knows logically her family are homophobic horrible people but humans are built of a need to belong and no one no matter how much therapy and work and willpower they have is immune to moments of such deep emotional belonging they don\u2019t wobble on things like deathbed apologies, Christmas bringing families together and that your parents will finally love you even via your kids one day especially on this last chance saloon.\n\nYou see her family are manipulating so of course you fear for the kids. She probably knows it and is ashamed, conflicted and confused what to do. I am estranged (my mother called armed police when she found out I was queer for context) and I have never regretted it. I went to therapy and processed years of PTSD level trauma and was healthily detached but aware \u2018oooh what when someone dies? Will I fall apart?\u2019 I have no contact with either side of my family.\n\nBut I was pretty confident. The pandemic started and that made me think yup, pretty family proofed. Then I had a freak life threatening illness in lockdown. I was told I had a strong possibility of not making it through that night. I emigrated. I was not allowed visitors (not Covid, the hospital were just being homophobic about my GF. We can\u2019t marry. Not legal in either home country.)\n\nAnd I wanted to call my mum. My mum who called the cops, who abused me. I didn\u2019t want her comfort. I wanted her to know if I died. I wanted to say things I never thought I would have need or change. I wanted my family to be aware on my deathbed the harm they did. I didn\u2019t have any of their numbers. I actually started digging through my block list. I realised I still hadn\u2019t felt resolution and you cannot pre-empt how death, births, marriages hit you in estrangement. Of course I assumed they would be dying first\u2026\n\nI did not call. Clearly I did not die. I also didn\u2019t tell anyone that I had been so thinking of my family my abusers not my loved ones at that moment. I still haven\u2019t told my GF because she would think I was forgiving them, doubting the estrangement, opening things up again. In fact I was opening up the grief that they will never change and their abuse can never be changed. I was connecting with it not rationalising and I couldn\u2019t explain. But it did actually shift far more trauma than therapy. In the two years since I shed so much that others told me would be the wrong way but I knew was a gut instinct, finally making me central in the family and it let it go properly. I had done the work to have it ready but often it takes an ending or start to really really do it not reorganise it a lot.\n\nYour wife may need to do things you will never understand to resolve herself about this. You can discuss safe sane consenting ways the kids come into that but you may need to trust her that she is doing something that actually takes back control from controlling people. Trying to dictate how someone gets a sense of autonomic control after abuse is a fight that just activates more need to scrabble for control. People push harder as it floods the same systems with more people.\n\nSet boundaries if needs be like not funding them a la we do not shop at the Salvation Army. Say you can only talk through stuff like gas, mileage etc if her insistence triggers the hurt you feel at their homophobia reaching you. Work out priorities, ultimatums and dealbreakers but generally just understanding that she\u2019s in a spiral because this is the moment she has to let go of hope every single unloved unaccepted child has their whole lives will probably free up most of the bickering by listening and empathising.\n\nShe\u2019s grieving her dad dying, the milestones that will never be, never were and the family she never had or will. It is complicated grief and it\u2019s incredibly common in abuse survivors and estranged people. They are heavily shamed for still wanting a happy ever after despite having the bravery to walk away physically. It\u2019s really painful when you are shamed for still wanting love from people who harmed you. This is why I never tell people I get sad at Christmas about my family. They always do absolutes. I\u2019m just sad. It will pass. It doesn\u2019t mean going back. Neither does actual grief when an abuser dies.\n\nEstrangement is a bereavement and it comes in waves. Death estranges you all over again and it is lonely grieving anyway. Estranged people often never have the societal understanding they grieved the living and are now expected to hate the dead. The opposite love is not hate, it\u2019s indifference. And the human mind is not wired to be indifferent around death. You are a neurologist. You know how the brain works. Don\u2019t expect your wife\u2019s brain not to interact with her heart.\n\nYou can support her at distance and your own level of comfort but right now NAH. YTA if you do not take the privilege of being not turned upside down and use it to support your family unit as the level headed but not coldly logical one.", "As I and you said \"might\". I would assume the wife to leave instantly if something like that was said. They will have probably somehow talked with their kids about things like that anyway as sadly this can happen in school etc as well and often does. You cannot protect your kids from the whole world or every asshole. \n\nIt's sadnif it happens but won't likely cause eternal trauma. Also I would assume the wife to be a responsible parent and act in her kids regard.", "thank you, i\u2019m surprised at all the \u201cwhat could possibly go wrong\u201d responses saying op is the ah. i agree with OP in that wife should test the waters first, maybe they have changed and if so that\u2019s great! but there\u2019s no way to know first without seeing for herself and i think it would be so awful if the kids had to witness homophobia towards their mom from their own family, even if she is able to defend herself and remove themselves from the situation. at the end of the day a parent\u2019s priority should be about the kids and their safety and comfort, and i don\u2019t think it\u2019s guaranteed here. hoping for the best, as it is a difficult and sad situation.

Would she just sit there and allow them to harm her children? As that is basically what you are implying to your wife.

Actual abusers, btw.\n\nI understand the concern, but boiling down a womans concerns over her children being exposed to people she doesnt know or trust that actively dislike their lifestyle as abuse is ridiculous and dilutes both discussing actual abuse and minimises the real impacts it has. Its not like she's stopping her partner going, she just doesnt trust abusive strangers with her kids like a normal, good parent.\n\nI think the problem is communication personally - that both are blinded by the emotions of their own perspectives and arent considering the others valid point's. Personality, I think the right call would be to have a zoom or skype call with the parents first or something to understand the situation better and decide how to proceed from there. \n\nAnd you minimising the trauma of homophobia and the environment it creates is ironic and gross.

You and your family are in a terrible position.bi work with a lot of clients in my clinical role who have varying degrees of estrangement from their families, and this hope your wife has is completely understandable given the circumstances. A dying father with little time left, a decade of time to dull the memory and pain of the mistreatment that led to the estrangement, and of course the lure from mom and dad about how they want to be able to reconnect for the grandkids in their later years now that they have come to understand the importance of family.\n\nIt's certainly possible that your wife going as the only adult caring for the children could go fine. But in my experience it's much more likely to leave her feeling alone and without backup to help her enforce her boundaries and protect the 3 of them if her parents get back to their usual ways.\n\nThe desperate hope of reconciliation, even against all reason, is a common feature of these kinds of reunions. It is psychologically shattering to live with the knowledge that your parents' love was conditional and that they suffered not a bit from erasing you from their lives. I know that it's generally understood at this point that people who are disowned by their parents often feel hurt and lost, but I don't know how many people truly understand the way it completely destroys any and every understanding of what love, care, family, trust, and security mean to a person. To have them reach out after all this time is like living in the fantasy world that we used to cry ourselves to sleep wishing for, and wgich never really left our hopes even as we tried to learn how to accept its absence. It's next to impossible to retain your reasoning and boundaries in the face of that, speaking from both personal and professional experience.\n\nAnd no, it doesn't matter how much we have ranted or screamed or cursed their names or sworn we'll never let them make us care again. How is your wife supposed to resist the daydream of her parents seeing their relationship in a new light just in time for her father's last chance at christmas with her and the kids?\n\nYou can try to be her reason. My wife tried to be mine for years. Eventually, we had to come to an agreement about  our own boundaries within the relationship because she couldn't bear to keep warning me of the risks only for me to ignore her in the moment and break down when her predictions came true. It took 6 attempts at recconnection, years of therapy, and several years into our marriage before that happened.\n\nRealistically, you are absolutely in the right here. She should not bring the kids. But just as realistically, I don't think you can reasonably expect her to see that right now. It would be great if she could, but she's looking at a christmas miracle and you're warning her that it's actually a nightmare and I just don't see a way to her hearing that until it goes south for you all.\n\nMy recommendation would be to make one or a few of the following suggestions, couched in as much patience and compassion as you can muster right now (lord knows that's not fair, but you know and I know your wife will need you desperately on the other end of this even if she doesn't realize it yet):\n1) suggest that she visit on her own prior to christmas to test the waters, and if things go well, yall can talk about the kids going with her for christmas\n2) suggest that even though you can't go with her, she should at least take another trusted adult who can be there to help her with the kids and to process any feelings that come up. If you go this route, point out that even if everything goes perfectly, she's going to have a lot of potentially overwhelming feelings to process, and you just want to make sure she has a friend/confidant there to help her make the most of her time, whatever that ends up meaning\n3) suggest that she go down on her own first and then once you have the time to go with her, the two of you can take the kids.\n4) suggest that when she goes down alone she could bring videos, pictures, and maybe even letters written by the kids so that her parents can get to know them a little before actually meeting them, to help them make the best impression they can as grandparents.\n5) let her know that she can make the choice to take the children, but you will be scheduling alternating family and couples therapy for you all as soon as she gets back, not as a punishment, but to process anything (good or bad) that comes from this decision.\n\nSomewhere in all of this desperation from your wife, I can almost guarantee, is the belief that if she does not bring the children for christmas, her parents will be angry enough to refuse to rebuild their relationship, and if she wants this last hope of reconciliation she needs to take the risk. She may need to be reminded that if her parents get so angry with her for not bringing the kids into a completely unknown and highly emotional volitile environment by herself during the christmas holiday that they refuse to have a relationship with her, that is reflective of their cruelty, not her failure to be a good enough daughter to deserve their love. Because right now, that's what she's trying to prove. That she can be a child worthy of being loved by their parents. Because if that's true, maybe she can finally believe she's worthy of being loved at all.\n\nAnd yeah. Maybe in the past it hasn't felt that dire to her, but her parents reaching out like this in the way they have will have stirred up all sorts of vulnerability and self-loathing, and she may not be aware of how much she is willing to compromise herself, her values, and her family in order to seek validation of her worth from her parents.\n\nChildren should never have to doubt that their parents love them, no matter the age. And when we do, we often make some truly awful decisions in the process of trying to be worth loving. My heart is with you both right noe, because there is likely no good outcome here, only damage control. I'm really sorry because that leaves you in an especially painful spot that probably feels like an enormous strain on your relationship.\n\nNAH, but you are definitely the one thinking clearly right now, so please try to keep yourself steady for your wife and kids, and if you decide you must put your foot down, do it with the knowledge of just how much fear and hurt is probably impacting her decisions right now so that hopefully your family can move forward together when this ends.", "YTA.

That bodes very well for your wife. If they just invited her and the kids I would share some of your concern. \n\nAdditionally, while you can voice concerns, ultimately it's her relationship with her parents. \n\nThey have not done or said anything negative directly to you, you have never met them. \n\nThey are also her children as well as yours.
