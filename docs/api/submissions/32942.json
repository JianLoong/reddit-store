The oldest is fine eating it but my youngest hates it due to my wife. The first time I made some meatloaf with it my wife commented that it\u2019s Bambi.

Your wife is welcome to think that venison is disgusting, but she needs to control her reactions and stop actively sabotaging your kids' reactions to it. Or, as you've suggested, find a way to provide an alternative on her own.", "I'm going to set aside the economic issue here, which is totally valid in and of itself. Venison is delicious. A full carcass could feed your family meat for a season or more if properly butchered and stored for pennies on the dollar compared to store bought cuts. None of this is in question. The issue here seems to be the moral imperative of killing and eating a deer.\n\nEntire cultures, including nearly all of the western world, relied on deer (or other ruminants) hunting for the vast majority of human history in some degree. Domestication of cattle and goats shifts this into an industrial scale, but the animals are generally the same in intelligence and behavior. \n\nYour wife calling deer \"Bambi\" as some sort of emotional/moral complaint is ridiculous. Cows, pigs, and chickens can be just as playful and friendly as any other creature (head over to r/Awww and a fifth of the videos are cows playing or people showing how their chickens like hugs these days). Unless your wife is not eating ***any*** meat, this is just deliberate sabotage for no purpose.\n\nDeer hunting is needed (at least in the US) to keep populations in line as we have eliminated their primary predators to such an extent that unmanaged deer populations can be ecologically devastating. Better we eat what we kill as part of wildlife management than kill and let it go to waste.\n\nThe industrialization of the meat industry has done us few favors as a society, but the worst of it is somehow making the connection between living creature to food taboo.

My understanding of deer meat is it\u2019s very nutritious and leaner than most meats. If she has such a problem with it like you said she can work overtime and pay for more expensive meat.

Venison is also delicious and a valid sub for beef in many recipes, its taste is not going to be dramatically alien or unusual to any person who happily eats other meats.

If this man actually bagged a deer and knew how to store the meat this isn't his first rodeo, he's had the equipment for some time. I'm not a hunter either but it's basic common sense that you don't buy new equipment every time. Properly stored and maintained equipment can last for someone's whole lifetime and be passed on afterwards for further use.", "That sounds like a false dichotomy.  It's not either/or.  I hunt and the only money I invest into it is the tag (<$20 and B tags are often half that), a box of shells (About $22 every other year) and a small amount of gas.  I've been fortunate enough to get a deer on the way home from work before.  \n\nI can get between 50 and 60 lbs of meat from one deer depending on a few factors including species.  Local burger prices are over $5/lb not to mention steak prices.  Just on the low end of meat weight set against local burger prices, subtracting the monetary cost of hunting, I save around $200 per deer per year.  It would be a bit less if I didn't butcher my own deer.\n\nYour other point about time invested is valid but not necessarily prohibitive.  Some years I've spent tens of hours hunting, most often with my wife.  It often doesn't take that long.  I'm lucky if I don't see one roadkill deer a week on the 20 mile drive to/from work, and I also never go a day without seeing a dozen or so deer just in town.  They're plentiful to the point of being a nuisance here.\n\nThis is anecdotal of course, but it's not less relevant than your comment.  Without knowing OP's hunting set-up and location, it could be even more profitable than my own.  Hunting cost is very front heavy.  Once you have the equipment you need, the cost can be minimal as long as one doesn't get goofy.  It doesn't have to be an activity only for wealthy people.  I grew up rather poor and I was always required to fill a tag to help feed the family.", "I\u2019m 10 years into hunting it literally costs like $45 for a tag to get a deer, and every single time I say \u201cI\u2019m lucky enough to get a deer this year\u201d lol.", "\"equipment\" = buy a $25 license and borrow a friends rifle and come back with 120lbs+ of meat...", "Really doesn't cost much for equipment. Grandpa's old bolt action can do the job for 1$ a round.\n\nEven if you bought a rifle and scope, it would still be cheaper than paying for that equivalent amount of meat at a grocery store. 400$ for a new rifle and 250$ for a scope, throw in some ammo to practice and you're looking at 800$. Avg price for lean ground beef right now is about ~7$/lb. On the conservative end, a deer will yield 60lbs of meat, which is ~400$ if you were to buy it in the store. Frankly, you could probably find a service used rifle/scope at an estate sale for that price.\n\nIt's pretty common for yields to be higher than that, but in any case, you can recoup the investment cost after two deer at a minimum. Sure you might have more expenses if you take it to a processing plant, or have to pay for a game license, but those margins are pretty large, and you could use the rifle next season anyhow. All in all, it's actually a pretty sound investment.\n\nIf you're a true enviornmental conservationist, you could stretch it even further by using the bones for soup/sauces.\n\nDon't judge the practicality and investment value of hunting based on the guys that go all in and buy tons of equipment.

Dry, overcooked ground deer meat tastes awful and has the worst crumbly texture to it. \n\nIf you\u2019re browning it to use as part of a dish that will receive further cooking, such as in a casserole (I love making tater tot casserole with my deer meat), cook the ground deer to only \u201cmedium rare\u201d instead of fully cooking it through. The second cook as a complete dish will take care of any concerns of undercooked ground meat, and the end product will be much juicier with a preferable flavor and texture compared to cooking it fully and then cooking it more as a complete dish (getting dry and crumbly in the process). Deer is fantastic in dishes like casseroles or hamburger helper style meals, where the meat isn\u2019t the only thing on your plate and it has some kind of sauce to help retain moisture. \n\nIn that same vein, ground deer is not great for \u201cmeat only\u201d dishes like breakfast sausage or burgers without extra care in the prep or cooking. It still can be done, it just is a lot easier to mess it up. Deer burgers can usually be done without any mixing of other meat (depends on how much fat was used in the grind really), but are usually better when cooked slow in the oven or a smoker than on a hot grill or griddle. For breakfast sausage you will almost ALWAYS have to add extra fat, either cutting the deer with pork/beef or using something like tallow while cooking it. \n\nMixing deer with pork or beef to use less pork/beef for the same large finished product (I\u2019ve enjoyed any and all ratios of mixes I\u2019ve tried, but I also enjoy the taste of the venison itself) is also a good way to add some fat to it and make cooking it a little more forgiving.

If he makes the average hourly pay of a man in the USA he is sacrificing 288 - 432 at minimum just to be out there.
