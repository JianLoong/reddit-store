They were very small, especially wet and I just didn't see them. My clothes are all dark, and when I washed my load, the color washed into them and they are now grey. Apparently, they were brand new clothes that she was washing for the first time and were high quality.\n\nI realize this is my fault that I didn't see them, but I also think that if she valued her clothes so much, she should have came to pick them up earlier.

This is the most basic thing you do when using a communal laundry machine. You check if it's empty.", "YTA for refusing to immediately replace what you ruined by not checking the drum properly. It takes one second to spin the drum/check under the lip. You should be doing that regardless since all sorts of stuff comes out of people's pockets in shared machines.", "YTA. Even though she should have gotten them earlier, you were lazy and didn't double check (I recommend feeling around, not just looking) to make sure that you had gotten all of the clothes out which is standard procedure when emptying out a washing machine for yourself or for someone else. \n\nAt the end of the day it's this simple: Another person's property was ruined due to your negligence. Therefore you are responsible for those damages.", "ESH. I\u2019m actually really conflicted here? First, communal laundry sucks. It really really does, and everyone feels slightly like a jerk when you have to move someone else\u2019s laundry. \n\nMy first instinct was to say that you did nothing wrong, because you waited a good amount of time and she shouldn\u2019t have left her laundry unattended.\n\nBut\u2026you did ruin her clothes. I know it was on accident! But we\u2019ve all gotten caught up and didn\u2019t switch our laundry over as quickly as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean our laundry deserves to get ruined. I know you didn\u2019t mean to, and it was an accident, so I\u2019d say you\u2019re very lightly a jerk here. \n\nShe\u2019s a jerk for going off on you. She left her clothing unattended. If you leave something unattended, something maybe happen to it. \n\nSo I\u2019m pretty conflicted with this one, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re super in the wrong?

Most laundry rooms like that even have a warning that the person doing their laundry is responsible for any loss theft or damage.", "NTA you all use a communal laundry and mistakes like this are bound to happen from time to time, its the risk everyone took when they decided to move in to this place AND also when they decided to be lackadaisical about when their laundry would finish knowing full well other people may need to use these machines", "ESH.

If they were so high valued, she should've sent them off to a laundromat or dry cleaner. NTA", "NTA, and I think most people that would disagree haven't lived in an apartment with communal laundry, or theyre the people that think the whole wotls wsits for them. People need to get their own stuff out on time or run risks. Maybe she made a mistake and missed setting a timer, and you made a mistake missing some clothes. Guess you're even.", "All these comments stating YTA obviously aren't aware of how communal laundromats work. It's her responsibility to attend her clothes in a timely manner which did not happen. If someone left their bike in the middle of a road (a public place) for an extended period of time and eventually a car came along that didn't see it and accidentally hit it causing damage and then the bike owner came back and demanded money for the damages, would you blame the cars driver? No. You'd tell the person who's bike it was not to leave their stuff unattended in the middle of a road and to take better care of it. NTA or ever so slightly ESH but more NTA. \n\nThe polite thing to do would be to replace or pay half, but that's only if you don't want beef with your neighbor and people do retaliate even when they're in the wrong so be careful about your clothes in the future or else it could happen purposefully to you.

Run the white clothing with it & the white clothing will be fine.", "NTA -people need to set a timer on the phone when using the community laundromat.

I rented for a long time and couldn\u2019t stand when people would take up every single washer and leave sometimes for hours without switching loads over. Those same people got their clothes dumped out on the floor by angry tenants who needed to wash after them. It is what it is. I rarely left my clothes unattended because I didn\u2019t want people messing with my clothes, and on the rare occasions that I did I would pop back in every 15 minutes to check on the cycle.

Not your fault that they are slow/lazy/stupid.", "NTA for accidentally ruining them. Accidents happen, but taking accountability is also important.\nHer yelling at you wasn't necessary imo. \nBut why wouldn't you agree to pay at least part of the cost OR at least offer to get her some cleaning product out of courtesy for accidentally damaging her clothes?", "NTA. If your neighbors clothes were so expensive, she should\u2019ve taken better care of them by attending to her laundry in a timely manner.", "NTA. Gotta pick up your clothes promptly; that's kind of a given for shared laundry spaces. If they were that expensive, she'd stay there to make sure her clothes weren't stolen.", "NTA. If she was so worried about it, she should have been there to take care of her clothes.", "NTA - not their laundress.", "Sounds like both of you shared equally in it happening. I think an attempt to get the color that bled onto her stuff should be attempted. Google it. Not sure if Zote soaking all in a bucket with warm water will help with that. Clorox free bleach. Oxi-clean? Hydrogen peroxide? I do know once somebody gave me a product that was used to do just that. I think it\u2019s generous of her to suggest go 50/50.

The desks are quite small and can only fit one laptop. However, people often leave their laptops on a desk on their day off, thinking \"there's plenty of desks\". Now you come in and see all the desks have laptops, so you have to move one. As you do, you trip and it falls to the floor and breaks. Would AITA expect you to pay for it? No, because you *had* to move it in order to work.\n\nWhen someone leaves their laundry in the machine, they are *forcing* others to either (A) go to a laundromat, (B) make possibly their whole day about constantly checking to see whether there's finally an empty machine, or (C) *touch a stranger's underpants*.\n\nI see my viewpoint is wildly unpopular. You don't want to start one of these so-called laundry wars. I bet anything though that this woman will lie to you about that value of those clothes.

I initially thought this would be that there was a small mark on the clothes because of dirt and OP wasn't being unreasonable, but sorry, if you left some of their clothes in the drum and then ruined them with your clothes, it's up to you to apologise and pay for them. \n\nOr else, I guess, maybe move because this neighbour could get very petty and it won't end well for you.", "What in the Big-City Fuck is a laundry war??

Also, this was several machines that were finished and nobody came to get it, so I guess this apartment building has a pretty relaxed attitude towards this.", "True, it was an accident. Let me change my analogy then: instead of someone stealing the bike on purpose, they had a similar bike and thought the other one was theirs. Now taking the bike is an accident. Are they an asshole for taking the bike? No, it was a mistake. BUT if they happen to crash the bike and damage it, they would be the asshole for refusing to pay the actual owner to cover the damages. I think this is more accurate to OP\u2019s story. They made a mistake, but their mistake caused damage to somebody else\u2019s property.

You know, because there are basic expectations that the property owner should do the minimum to safeguard their own property? \n\nIf I left my bike unlocked in public, I would definitely not expect someone to repair or replace it if they accidentally took it and crashed it, because I could have and should have been responsible for the safety of my own property. In fact, if someone did that, and then tracked me down to confess it, I'd be shocked! I would have expected the missing bike to have been stolen, and would have been kicking myself for being stupid enough to leave it unlocked.

She's blocking the machine with her clothes, making other people wait on her, and making them move her shit if they want to be able to even get started on their own laundry. She has no right to be mad if they don't do it perfectly, and even less right to demand actual *money* from them for HER mistake of not being there to handle her own laundry.\n\nI don't get your mentality at all, dude.
