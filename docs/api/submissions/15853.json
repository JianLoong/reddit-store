I was trying to do my laundry today and saw that all of the laundry machines were taken. However, I noticed that many of them were done, the owners just did not pick their clothes up. After waiting for 10-20 minutes and no one came to pick up the clothes, I emptied the contents of one of the machines and set them on the side (this is a policy in our apartment). When I came back to get my laundry, this other person (also F) started yelling that I ruined her new clothes and demanded I pay her the price of her new clothes.\n\nIt turns out that when I was moving the clothes, I missed some white clothes. They were very small, especially wet and I just didn't see them. My clothes are all dark, and when I washed my load, the color washed into them and they are now grey. Apparently, they were brand new clothes that she was washing for the first time and were high quality.\n\nI realize this is my fault that I didn't see them, but I also think that if she valued her clothes so much, she should have came to pick them up earlier. I apologized, but she still wants me to pay for at least a part of the cost of the clothes.

Your neighbour wasn't pissed because you moved her clothes (you were right to do that), she was pissed because you washed them with yours and thus ruined them. And the only reason you washed them with yours is you didn't take the time to check properly the drum was empty before dumping your load in it. This is the most basic thing you do when using a communal laundry machine. You check if it's empty.", "YTA for refusing to immediately replace what you ruined by not checking the drum properly. It takes one second to spin the drum/check under the lip. You should be doing that regardless since all sorts of stuff comes out of people's pockets in shared machines.", "YTA. Even though she should have gotten them earlier, you were lazy and didn't double check (I recommend feeling around, not just looking) to make sure that you had gotten all of the clothes out which is standard procedure when emptying out a washing machine for yourself or for someone else. \n\nAt the end of the day it's this simple: Another person's property was ruined due to your negligence. Therefore you are responsible for those damages.", "ESH. I\u2019m actually really conflicted here? First, communal laundry sucks. It really really does, and everyone feels slightly like a jerk when you have to move someone else\u2019s laundry. \n\nMy first instinct was to say that you did nothing wrong, because you waited a good amount of time and she shouldn\u2019t have left her laundry unattended.\n\nBut\u2026you did ruin her clothes. I know it was on accident! But we\u2019ve all gotten caught up and didn\u2019t switch our laundry over as quickly as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean our laundry deserves to get ruined. I know you didn\u2019t mean to, and it was an accident, so I\u2019d say you\u2019re very lightly a jerk here. \n\nShe\u2019s a jerk for going off on you. She left her clothing unattended. If you leave something unattended, something maybe happen to it. \n\nSo I\u2019m pretty conflicted with this one, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re super in the wrong? She\u2019s the main jerk, I think.", "YTA. If the policy is you can move it, it means moving ALL of it. You don\u2019t get to ruin her clothes and then act like your the victim for having to take them out of the machine. Be more aware of what you\u2019re doing.", "ESH\n\nYou moved it but didn't check it properly. You stated that as policy, there is nothing wrong with moving laundry. And to be fair, the other person isn't mad you moved it. They are mad you didn't move it all.\n\nYes, they could have been there exactly on time. You stated that other machines were also available. You chose her machine.  You missed her clothes. \n\nThe only thing that makes her \"suck\" is not being there exactly on time. Which honestly sucks but truly isn't a huge issue. You waited a bit and then moved it. And she wasn't mad about it, just mad you missed some items.\n\nI would say yes, you should pay for (at least half cause both could have done more) the clothes. Hopefully next time she is more prompt, and you check the drum a bit better.", "YTA\n\nIt's not that hard to make sure you get all the clothes out of the machine.  It's pretty standard behavior.", "YTA\n\nHer stuff was still wet,  she was going to come back and move them.  I know communal laundry rooms suck, and sometimes you do have to wait,  but 10-20 minutes is not that long.  Don't mess with other people's stuff.", "ESH. \n\nYour neighbor is TA for not coming to get their laundry in a timely manner.\n\nYou are also an AH for not checking to get all her clothes out.", "NTA. It\u2019s a communal laundromat. Keep timers. That\u2019s how my mom and I did it.", "NTA. As a former renter and sharing of the laundry facilities, keep track of your clothes if they are that important. All these Y T A comments must have never waited for washers and driers.", "NTA. How do you know that she is being truthful about the ruined clothes? It sounds like she went through your laundry looking for her missing items, which isn\u2019t ok. Then she yelled at you for something that was an accident. Pay her if it makes you feel better.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA. Most laundry rooms like that even have a warning that the person doing their laundry is responsible for any loss theft or damage.", "NTA you all use a communal laundry and mistakes like this are bound to happen from time to time, its the risk everyone took when they decided to move in to this place AND also when they decided to be lackadaisical about when their laundry would finish knowing full well other people may need to use these machines", "ESH. If you\u2019re going to remove the clothes you need to remove all of the clothes. But she should also have come back sooner and then you wouldn\u2019t have had to.", "They are communal washing machines, you waited a fair amount of time, it's not your job to take care of your neighbors laundry. If they were so high valued, she should've sent them off to a laundromat or dry cleaner. NTA", "NTA, and I think most people that would disagree haven't lived in an apartment with communal laundry, or theyre the people that think the whole wotls wsits for them. People need to get their own stuff out on time or run risks. Maybe she made a mistake and missed setting a timer, and you made a mistake missing some clothes. Guess you're even.", "All these comments stating YTA obviously aren't aware of how communal laundromats work. It's her responsibility to attend her clothes in a timely manner which did not happen. If someone left their bike in the middle of a road (a public place) for an extended period of time and eventually a car came along that didn't see it and accidentally hit it causing damage and then the bike owner came back and demanded money for the damages, would you blame the cars driver? No. You'd tell the person who's bike it was not to leave their stuff unattended in the middle of a road and to take better care of it. NTA or ever so slightly ESH but more NTA. \n\nThe polite thing to do would be to replace or pay half, but that's only if you don't want beef with your neighbor and people do retaliate even when they're in the wrong so be careful about your clothes in the future or else it could happen purposefully to you. But also if it does happen to you, don't expect them to pay for your damaged stuff.", "YTA check the dryer to make sure you have it all out, also don\u2019t mess with other peoples laundry.", "NTA\n\nHonest mistake.\n\nThere's some kind of laundry product that can pull the color out of clothes when this happens.", "Google colour run remover and buy some.  Run the white clothing with it & the white clothing will be fine.", "NTA -people need to set a timer on the phone when using the community laundromat. You didn\u2019t intentionally sabotage it, accidents happen, and if not for your neighbors tardiness (which cost you time) it wouldn\u2019t have happened at all", "NTA yeah you could have been more diligent to check for clothes in the washer, but it\u2019s not actually your problem and you did not maliciously destroy anything. I rented for a long time and couldn\u2019t stand when people would take up every single washer and leave sometimes for hours without switching loads over. Those same people got their clothes dumped out on the floor by angry tenants who needed to wash after them. It is what it is. I rarely left my clothes unattended because I didn\u2019t want people messing with my clothes, and on the rare occasions that I did I would pop back in every 15 minutes to check on the cycle. If you leave your things unattended, you don\u2019t get to complain about what happens to them.", "NTA. They are supposed to look after their laundry. Not your fault that they are slow/lazy/stupid.", "NTA for accidentally ruining them. Accidents happen, but taking accountability is also important.\nHer yelling at you wasn't necessary imo. But why wouldn't you offer/agree to pay at least part of the cost?", "NTA. If your neighbors clothes were so expensive, she should\u2019ve taken better care of them by attending to her laundry in a timely manner.", "NTA. Gotta pick up your clothes promptly; that's kind of a given for shared laundry spaces. If they were that expensive, she'd stay there to make sure her clothes weren't stolen.", "NTA. If she was so worried about it, she should have been there to take care of her clothes.", "NTA - not their laundress.", "Sounds like both of you shared equally in it happening. I think an attempt to get the color that bled onto her stuff should be attempted. Google it. Not sure if Zote soaking all in a bucket with warm water will help with that. Clorox free bleach. Oxi-clean? Hydrogen peroxide? I do know once somebody gave me a product that was used to do just that. I think it\u2019s generous of her to suggest go 50/50. All hope might not be lost with those clothes. And yes, it would be up to you to try to restore them. And if that fails, help replace them. NTA. Because you didn\u2019t mean to.
