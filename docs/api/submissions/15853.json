After waiting for 10-20 minutes and no one came to pick up the clothes, I emptied the contents of one of the machines and set them on the side (this is a policy in our apartment). When I came back to get my laundry, this other person (also F) started yelling that I ruined her new clothes and demanded I pay her the price of her new clothes.\n\nIt turns out that when I was moving the clothes, I missed some white clothes. They were very small, especially wet and I just didn't see them. My clothes are all dark, and when I washed my load, the color washed into them and they are now grey. Apparently, they were brand new clothes that she was washing for the first time and were high quality.\n\nI realize this is my fault that I didn't see them, but I also think that if she valued her clothes so much, she should have came to pick them up earlier.

This is the most basic thing you do when using a communal laundry machine. You check if it's empty.", "YTA for refusing to immediately replace what you ruined by not checking the drum properly. It takes one second to spin the drum/check under the lip. You should be doing that regardless since all sorts of stuff comes out of people's pockets in shared machines.", "YTA. Even though she should have gotten them earlier, you were lazy and didn't double check (I recommend feeling around, not just looking) to make sure that you had gotten all of the clothes out which is standard procedure when emptying out a washing machine for yourself or for someone else. \n\nAt the end of the day it's this simple: Another person's property was ruined due to your negligence. Therefore you are responsible for those damages.", "ESH. I\u2019m actually really conflicted here? First, communal laundry sucks. It really really does, and everyone feels slightly like a jerk when you have to move someone else\u2019s laundry. \n\nMy first instinct was to say that you did nothing wrong, because you waited a good amount of time and she shouldn\u2019t have left her laundry unattended.\n\nBut\u2026you did ruin her clothes. I know it was on accident! But we\u2019ve all gotten caught up and didn\u2019t switch our laundry over as quickly as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean our laundry deserves to get ruined. I know you didn\u2019t mean to, and it was an accident, so I\u2019d say you\u2019re very lightly a jerk here. \n\nShe\u2019s a jerk for going off on you. She left her clothing unattended. If you leave something unattended, something maybe happen to it. \n\nSo I\u2019m pretty conflicted with this one, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re super in the wrong? She\u2019s the main jerk, I think.", "YTA. If the policy is you can move it, it means moving ALL of it.

Most laundry rooms like that even have a warning that the person doing their laundry is responsible for any loss theft or damage.", "NTA you all use a communal laundry and mistakes like this are bound to happen from time to time, its the risk everyone took when they decided to move in to this place AND also when they decided to be lackadaisical about when their laundry would finish knowing full well other people may need to use these machines", "ESH.

If they were so high valued, she should've sent them off to a laundromat or dry cleaner. NTA", "NTA, and I think most people that would disagree haven't lived in an apartment with communal laundry, or theyre the people that think the whole wotls wsits for them. People need to get their own stuff out on time or run risks. Maybe she made a mistake and missed setting a timer, and you made a mistake missing some clothes. Guess you're even.", "All these comments stating YTA obviously aren't aware of how communal laundromats work. It's her responsibility to attend her clothes in a timely manner which did not happen. If someone left their bike in the middle of a road (a public place) for an extended period of time and eventually a car came along that didn't see it and accidentally hit it causing damage and then the bike owner came back and demanded money for the damages, would you blame the cars driver? No. You'd tell the person who's bike it was not to leave their stuff unattended in the middle of a road and to take better care of it. NTA or ever so slightly ESH but more NTA. \n\nThe polite thing to do would be to replace or pay half, but that's only if you don't want beef with your neighbor and people do retaliate even when they're in the wrong so be careful about your clothes in the future or else it could happen purposefully to you.

Run the white clothing with it & the white clothing will be fine.", "NTA -people need to set a timer on the phone when using the community laundromat. You didn\u2019t intentionally sabotage it, accidents happen, and if not for your neighbors tardiness (which cost you time) it wouldn\u2019t have happened at all", "NTA yeah you could have been more diligent to check for clothes in the washer, but it\u2019s not actually your problem and you did not maliciously destroy anything. I rented for a long time and couldn\u2019t stand when people would take up every single washer and leave sometimes for hours without switching loads over. Those same people got their clothes dumped out on the floor by angry tenants who needed to wash after them. It is what it is. I rarely left my clothes unattended because I didn\u2019t want people messing with my clothes, and on the rare occasions that I did I would pop back in every 15 minutes to check on the cycle.

Not your fault that they are slow/lazy/stupid.", "NTA for accidentally ruining them. Accidents happen, but taking accountability is also important.\nHer yelling at you wasn't necessary imo. But why wouldn't you offer/agree to pay at least part of the cost?", "NTA. If your neighbors clothes were so expensive, she should\u2019ve taken better care of them by attending to her laundry in a timely manner.", "NTA. Gotta pick up your clothes promptly; that's kind of a given for shared laundry spaces. If they were that expensive, she'd stay there to make sure her clothes weren't stolen.", "NTA. If she was so worried about it, she should have been there to take care of her clothes.", "NTA - not their laundress.", "Sounds like both of you shared equally in it happening. I think an attempt to get the color that bled onto her stuff should be attempted. Google it. Not sure if Zote soaking all in a bucket with warm water will help with that. Clorox free bleach. Oxi-clean? Hydrogen peroxide? I do know once somebody gave me a product that was used to do just that. I think it\u2019s generous of her to suggest go 50/50. All hope might not be lost with those clothes. And yes, it would be up to you to try to restore them. And if that fails, help replace them. NTA. Because you didn\u2019t mean to.

I mean, I have been sitting there waiting for my laundry to finish drying, and a woman was standing in front of my machine when there was one minute left tryna open it.  Then \\*I\\* got yelled at when I said, \"excuse me? That's my stuff and I'm not done with it.\" I had another load waiting to go in.  I never left. I sat there with a book bc I had two littles at home torturing their dad. lol   I'm so glad I don't have to deal with that anymore.

No problems.\n\nLiving in another place, I used a laundromat that I found out the hard way was frequented by someone who did roofing. Checking the machines for tar residue before using them each time was a pain, but they pretty much always used the same two dryers, and I learned to avoid those. Roofers gotta do laundry too, I suppose. My clothes were all shit then anyway, and it was the cheapest laundromat in town. I could have gone somewhere else if I really wanted. Point is, I knew it was MY responsibility to check the machines before I used them. And I never left my laundry alone.", "I agree with you, communal laundry sucks. How hard is it to set a timer so you don't inconvenience others?", "Yeah, I'm puzzled by all the Y T As, too. I have had to use communal laundry rooms and laundromats, and the basic rule everywhere was if the load stops, you better be there or who knows what's gonna happen to your laundry. Nice people would just remove it to somewhere clean, but not everyone is nice. And you can't guarantee you'll catch the person who mistreated your favorite sweater or whatever, if you're not there when your load stops. I think people who make their laundry someone else's problem are the problem. And this whole thread is giving me renewed gratitude for my trusty in-home washer & dryer! I think I'll go do some laundry now. \ud83d\ude0a", "Seriously. NTA.", "I just stay with my laundry read my book or play on my phone.

She never showed up, so I put them in her basket and put my stuff in. When I came back 40 min later to take them out, he stuff was gone and my wet clothes were on the floor.", "Yeah? Then maybe the perfect solution is if OP buys some for the lazy lady who didn't want to tend to/be responsible for her own laundry!", "In some complexes, I have seen people leave their clothes in the machine for hours. It is fine to move people clothes when they're done. Just make sure to get all of the clothes out and don't get them dirty.", "Why should OP do that? How much should OP pay? What if screamy I-don't-have-to-be-responsible-for-my-own-laundry lady hands OP a receipt for a $250 dollar item that isn't even what OP accidentally re-washed? \n\nI remember an incident in a communal laundry room where someone tried to get me to pay for some shit that I never even touched. She kept screaming at me \"but you're the one who's here!\" And she insisted that her stuff had been in the same machine. But it was empty when I got there, and I said so. \ud83e\udd37 She was so pissed that she couldn't intimidate me into giving her money.

That place sucked.", "I stay to it\u2019s actually faster then leaving and coming back", "People who make other people hang out waiting for them to come back for half an hour because they can't be bothered to stay with their laundry, or return on time, are the AHs. Laundry takes long enough as it is. \n\nOP should not have had to touch this woman's laundry, because that woman should have been there. If you leave your laundry, you take your chances. OP should not be bullied into paying.", "I'm in a laundry war with my neighbor for this exact thing almost. I was at the grocery store and she laid my wet WHITES on a note (it was on the washer) and my favorite dress and a couple work shirts now have blue,black, and red inks stains bled into them. I took half her clothes out and threw them in the garbage, and emptied out an ashtray into the rest.", "Sure. Maybe you get a call, or have to take a grundle though, that's what the policy is for. You leave it, someone else moves it to the side if they need a machine. And that's fine, that's how its supposed to work. \nWhat I'm saying is to check the machine before you dump your own shit in. Not just for the other person's clothing, but for whatever other detritus might be in the bottom in general.", "Meh. Shit happens. You set a timer and your mum calls, whatever, that's what the above mentioned policy is for- someone might move your stuff to the side if they're waiting on your machine. No problem. \nThe issue here is OP not bothering to check. Then refusing to cough up the money for ruining someone else's clothing. \nShe's lucky there wasn't a bunch of nails or a centre punch rolling around in the drum. Or a mop head. All things I've found in washing machines.", "Nah, in a shared laundry room, all bets are off when the machine stops. Set a timer and pick your stuff up on time if you don't want it touched.\n\nLiterally every shared laundry situation I've been in has even had posted, written policy for this. At most, they offer a ten minute grace period.", "Naw dawg, if you leave your laundry in a busy laundry room for 20 minutes after the load is done it's gonna get taken out. That's just part of life.\n\nThat said op should have checked the drum.", "That\u2019s not how it works in shared laundry spaces. If you don\u2019t come back in a timely manner, your stuff will be moved so someone else can utilize the machines. It\u2019s not fair to hog them because the person can\u2019t tell time.\n\nWith that being said, OP should have fully checked the drum before putting in their clothes. So they are at fault for the damage. ESH.", "Since I'm bad at emptying the dryer at home, my roommate tells me when she's planning to do laundry so I know to empty the dryer. But when I did laundry at the laundromat, I always brought a book and got comfortable because I knew I'd be spending the morning there.", "I'm not sure. If someone left a vase in front of a door and I knocked it over  then that was an accident, but it still shouldn't have been left there.", "Also, sometimes kids can be so upset by something that they aren't ready to make up, just like us adults (i.e, the lady with her ruined clothes.) I want my kids to remember that sometimes when you mess up, even by accident, people won't want to (or have to!) accept your \"sorry\", and that's their choice as well. I explain it to them like this: \"Let's say you accidentally broke a mirror. You could glue it back together, but there will still be cracks, right? So if you make a mistake, you should say sorry, but realize it doesn't take away the cracks. Sometimes sorries take time.\"", "Even so OP didn\u2019t do really check the drum that well.", "OP isnt the AH for moving her load. Theyre the AH for not compensating for the damage they caused due to their own negligence of not checking the drum properly. \n\nAccidents happen, but you also compensate for it if its caused by you.

Same as literally every single communal laundry facility.", "I agree!", "This is the type of crazy I don\u2019t need in my life.", "You best be sitting in the laundry room the whole time your clothes are in there, and using a sizable laundry hamper to and from from now on! \n\nThats\u2019s petty, and the escalation is going to be brutal. \n\n\ud83c\udf7f", "That\u2019s when I would take your laundry out every single time and throw them in the trash. Taking them out is one thing but throwing them away man nah that\u2019s wayyy too far", "\"I was at the grocery store...\"\n\n Maybe next time just look after your laundry?", "I would just go to a laundromat from now on if I were you.", "It really does escalate quickly. I've seen people dump detergent into other people's rinse cycles and foam their crap to hell. Laundry gets people crazy.", "Wow. This is crazy to me. I had the opposite happen when I was living in college dorms. I would occasionally forget about my drying and leave it in there well past when it was dry. Standard/accepted practice when this happened and you were waiting for a dryer to become free was to remove the dry load, pile it on the table next to the dryers and dry your own clothes. Finished wash loads were generally taken out and piled on top of the washer.\n\nIt didn't always happen, but on more then one occasion when I forgot about my clothes in the dryer I would arrive downstairs (Our washers/dryers were in the basement of the dorms I was living in.) to a pile of folded and neatly stacked laundry. Blew my frickin' mind.\n\nNever did find out who did it, but to this day I have warm feelings towards whoever my freshman dorm's \"laundry angel\" was. \n\nThat only ever happened in college dorms. When I lived in an apartment with washers I rarely used them 'cause they were overpriced, nearly always broken, and there was a laundromat less than a block away.\n\nOP YTA, be a laundry angel, not a laundry demon.", "Soak them in isopropyl alcohol.", "God you're both terrible and horrible people.", "Honest question, what's a grundle?", "I\u2019ve been doing laundry with a timer for years and this has never happened to me. Yeah sure a couple minutes is fine but 10-20 is absolutely fucking insane. I agree op is a bozo. I definitely would be cautious of paying for another persons clothes. I wouldn\u2019t trust the cost at all. Honestly I may be an asshole for this but I straight up wouldn\u2019t pay, unless it\u2019s some clothing that can easily by looked up or better yet receipts provided, nah, take the L and fuck off. Shit happens. Shouldn\u2019t have left your shit in a public laundromat. \n\nThen I\u2019d switch laundromats \ud83d\ude02", "The other girl wasn\u2019t in the right\u2026but the appropriate response is\u2026to take her stuff out and leave it on the table. Those are equal offsets. \n\nBut when *YOU choose* to move other people\u2019s laundry, you take a risk, and OP\u2019s lackadaisical emptying caused harm to the other girl. Which is not an equal offset to what the girl did. \n\nWhich is why OP owes the other girl.", "Or at least if they took you to court for breaking their vase you would have a decent contributory negligence counterclaim.", "This, having used communal laundry rooms in the past it's pretty much use at your own risk. I've seen laundry left in the washer so long it got mildewed and that washer wad unusable until the management got it cleaned. If I left my laundry unattended like this the only person I can be mad at is myself.", "My fnl owned rental property with a laundry room. He would get soooooo pissed off over the shenanigans amongst tenants. He eventually just locked up the laundry and said the hell with you all.", "Exactly like if you left your finished load unattended taking your a washer and someone moved it out how can you be mad?", "ESH.\n\nYour neighbor is TA for not coming to get their laundry in a timely manner.\n\nYou are also an AH for not checking to get all her clothes out.", "Based on context I think they're using it as a word for shit, though I've always heard it as another word for taint", "I think the girl wasn't in the right because, according to OP anyway, she started the encounter yelling and making demands. The girl didn't seem to mind the moving of clothes. Just the fact that OP didn't remove all of them."]}
