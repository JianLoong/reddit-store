My boyfriends salary is 75k and mine is 30k (formally 40k) We recently moved into a small town after living in a major city because it was where his family lived. I love this town and I love our house but it\u2019s incredibly hard for me to find work. We pay a lot for rent, however my boyfriend wanted to live here so badly that he said he would pay majority of our rent just so I would be on board. (When I put our income into rent split it was the suggested even split based on income, so he\u2019s paying more but it\u2019s even based on income) This was fine until everyone at my job was let go. I went in person and online and applied to every tiny job in this town. It took two weeks and I finally got hired to work front desk at the clubhouse in our housing community. Around this time our 6 month lease was coming to an end and I mentioned to my boyfriend that living in this small town I am lonely and depressed and scared I won\u2019t be able to find work if for some reason I lose this job. My boyfriend is only home for about 7 days of the entire month. I suggested moving back to the city but he doesn\u2019t want to. He spends time in the city the entire month traveling for work, so he likes the small town to come home to. \n\nNow to the story. Because I wasn\u2019t working for two weeks, I didn\u2019t have enough money to help pay the full amount of my part of rent. My boyfriend wasn\u2019t going to cover it so I had to borrow some money from a friend. I casually mentioned this story to another girl who worked in the office with me. She mentioned something to me that was not brought up to me before:  which was that $400 would be taken off of our rent every month because I worked in the office. I thought this was perfect because I did end up taking a pay cut in order to live in the city that he wants to live in, so I figured that $400 would be taken off of my part of rent. This $400 would be life changing for me. I would actually have money to save up and not just break even every month. \n\nWhen I brought up to my boyfriend that $400 would be taken off of rent and that I would now be paying less he was very upset. Said I was being selfish to think the $400 would be taken off my rent at all and if anything he\u2019s paying more and it should be taken off of his. We had a long argument and now he\u2019s gone for work so he\u2019s not talking to me. \n\nAITA for taking the $400 off of my rent after I\u2019ve sacrificed so much for him?", "created_utc": 1680834619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12e6q1j/aita_for_refusing_to_share_the_employee/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here's why. He's gone most of the time, yet he's forcing you to live where he wants to without any interest in how you feel about it. You are the only one sacrificing and you're sacrificing a whole lot. You get that discount as a perk of your job. He would not get it if you weren't working there, so he's not entitled to it. You no longer earn as much as you did, and if he takes that money, then you are essentially living in a place alone with out support and without finances. He'll have completed trapping you in a seriously difficult for you situation. He's not trying to see things from your point of view. He doesn't care how you're struggling. He's not worth your time and sacrifice. NTA", "NTA \n\nThe perk of having a $400/month rent reduction falls into the category of being your benefit alone. You should receive the full $400/monthly reduction to your portion of the rent.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is being unreasonable and greedy. He\u2019s also not very concerned with your comfort/happiness. He makes much more money, you sacrificed you job and salary to move to a town he wanted to live and then when you take a big pay cut, he won\u2019t cover the rent? Keeping you broke is a form of control. Financial abuse is a thing. You may want to rethink this relationship as it seems to be all about him.", "NTA - Your job is giving you $400 to apply to rent. You are still making a lot less than him. \n\nBut this guy sounds pretty selfish. He's not being considerate of your desires or career goals. If he insists on living somewhere where you can't pursue your chosen career then he has to understand that he has to help make up for that. Either that or you should move back to where you can find better work. Hell if he's there most of the time anyways, why are you making the sacrifice to be in his small town? Why can't you too stay there where you can find better work, and a few days a month he can go stay with his family.", "NTA,\n\nYour boyfriend is being selfish and greedy. When you couldn\u2019t pay ur part, he didn\u2019t bother to pitch in. But he gets to dictate how you use a perk from your job? Idk, you need to have a serious talk with this dude. Idk if there is more details needed but at least from what you wrote, he doesn\u2019t have your interests in mind", "NTA, it's your job that got you a deal on the rent, so it should be your half of the rent. And seriously? He couldn't chip in for a month making you take a \"loan\" from a friend?", " NTA. You took a pay cut so he could \"live\" in his home town. (Although I'd hardly calling bring home 7 days a week living some place. ) He wouldn't even help you out when you were looking for work. \n\nThe fact is, his desire to live there is ruining your finances and mental well being. And, he doesn't even care.  That's not a healthy relationship.", "NTA It\u2019s a perk for your job. You make considerably less. He fucking knew that fact coming in. Don\u2019t get me fucking started on wouldn\u2019t cover your portion of the rent. What if you became Ill, injured, or incapacitated? Just an FYI, it doesn\u2019t have to be like this no matter where you are. Man\u2019s not even decent.", "NTA\n\nMove. \n\nLeave him behind.", "How long have you two been together? Why didn\u2019t he want to just pay a portion of your part when you were out of a job for 2 weeks? A partnership is about picking up the slack when the other is down. And the $400 should be deducted from the total and you rework how much you both pay again based on income. Are you happy in this relationship? You both seem more like roommates than a couple. You\u2019re also sacrificing your happiness for his and that\u2019s just not okay either.", "NTA. you should only be equally splitting rent if you\u2019re roughly equally compromising. \n\nyou\u2019re making more of a sacrifice and still paying \u201chalf\u201d the rent if you account for take home. so not divvying this up is just getting you closer to an appropriate split for your circumstances. \n\nmost importantly, and both of us buried the lede on this, HE\u2019S ONLY HOME 7 DAYS A MONTH? the home for which YOU\u2019RE compromising?", "Revised my original comment because I misread the post. NTA. Your boyfriend sounds like he doesn\u2019t really respect your feelings or what would make you happy. Based on the wording in your post it also seems like you\u2019re starting to resent him a little bit. Assuming that the 400 is supposed to offset what seems like a low salary for you as the employee, so therefore it should apply to you.", "NTA - it is a benefit given to you because of where you work, it is considered part of your pay but be careful because you may owe taxes on it at the end of the year.", "Why are you with him?\n\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nHe\u2019s making 75k, has the job he wants, and the flat he wants. He had no complaints before, right? You found a job that allows you to pay less for rent, the benefit should go to you. You\u2019re not at the flat you want, and from the sounds of it, maybe not the job you want. \n\nHe\u2019s not considering the position you\u2019re in here. You deserve an opportunity to build up some wealth of your own.", "NTA, but your boyfriend sure is. He's deliberately forcing you into a situation in which you are dependent on him. If I were in Vegas, I'd be laying odds this relationship grows abusive on his end. You're being isolated, made financially dependent, denied opportunities for income and success on your own terms. You're not going to be happy in this relationship in the long run. If I were in your position, I would cut my losses and leave. He wouldn't even cover you when you had no income, despite the fact that he could easily afford it. He doesn't care about you. He's out for what works best for *him*, and him alone. He's selfish at BEST.", "So, he moves you to a small town where you can't make any money.  He's only there 7 days a month.  He thinks your \"perk\" from work should be taken off his portion.  \n\nIt sounds like he's really controlling, he wants you isolated with no money.  It doesn't bode well for a future with him.  \n\nConsider this, if he truly loved you, wouldn't he want you to struggle less financially?  He's making more than twice the amount you were making, why isn't he happy for you?  \n\nYou're NTA in this situation with him but if you continue \"sacrificing\" yourself for this guy, you will regret it.", "NTA and honestly what did you get out of this move? You moved for him, because HE wanted to be in his small town, but he is only there about 7 days a month?! So you move to a town where you have no friends, family or job prospects for HIM and he\u2019s barley even there?? And you barely have enough money and he is acting like you owe him this? Haven\u2019t you done enough? Honestly, if I were you I\u2019d go back\nto where you loved living and get a job you love and can be around friends. Seriously. This seems like it\u2019s about more than just money to me, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s feasible as a long term relationship when you give and give and he takes and takes.\n\nEdit: When I lost my job and was living with my soon to be husband, he took care of the majority of the bills until I got in my feet again, because financially, he could. Him not being willing the help you out speaks volumes to me.", "The four hundred dollars is part of your compensation.", "NTA. That $400 is a perk of your job and therefore part of your income. It should only be applied to your part alone. \n\nBut I honestly think you\u2019re so focused on the trees you\u2019ve missed the forest. The real issue here is that  every decision he has made is entirely self-centred and has not accounted for the sacrifices you\u2019ve made in following him. What has he compromised for you? This man is not a keeper.", "NTA. I don't know what calculator you used, but a percentage split based on income is very common. Saying it should be equal when he makes over double doesn't check out for me. It also is one of several signs he doesn't have your back. \n\nYou sacrificed a lot moving to the small town for him, meanwhile he still gets the benefit of city life. Really think about how you want the next couple years to go. You gotta look out for #1", "NTA - I don\u2019t see why you need to give him a benefit at your own expense. Is he trying to make you go into debt? He\u2019s not offering to lend you money!? Move home ! DO NOT GO INTO massive DEBT for his guy. He\u2019s home 7 days week! Loneliness combined with financial issues will mess your relationship up. Be prepared to leave if necessary.", "NTA. It's your benefit, not his.", "NTA - So when you couldn't cover rent to live in the town he wants you to live in, he wouldn't even loan you money? He's awful. Please think about leaving him. You're young, move to a city and live it up. He's selfish and greedy and will get worse once he gets more comfortable or when you're trapped by marriage or kids.", "After re-reading the post a couple of times, I have to say NTA.\n\nThe $400 is your part of the rent payment because YOU work there, and not him.  He is being the real AH here, and it is sounding like financial abuse.  They could pay you $400 more per month instead of that discount and it would be the same.  But they choose to discount your rent rather than pay you $400 more.  It's YOUR income/perk that YOU earn, and not him.\n\nHe is really the AH for not covering your portion while you were unemployed.  That is showing his true colors.  I would really rethink this relationship if he cannot see that this $400 discount is what you earn, and is your contribution to rent every month.\n\nIt sounds like he will always have the extra money to do what he wants, while you are living paycheck to paycheck and barely scraping by, and not able to afford extras.", "You should move back to the city so you can see him more. ESH.", "ESH. There's way more here than just the issue of evenly splitting rent. He seems to not respect your feelings at all. With that being said, you should be redividing the updated rent price instead of just taking 400$ off of your portion.", "What gibberish. Y'all sound less like boyfriend and girlfriend, and more like roommates with benefits but without the benefits. Either pay into the partnership or get out of the partnership.

So OP gets the full credit for the 400, but when calculating a proportional split,  the $5k rent discount needs to be counted in her salary so instead of basing % on 30k it needs to be 35k.", "I disagree. That $400 is a portion of her salary. She has sacrificed income and opportunities to live in a place he chose and he refuses to consider moving so that she has better income and opportunities.

If rent is 1500 then you should pay $429.\n\nBut due to the rent benefit your income really is $34,800+75k=$109,800. Meaning you bring in 31.7% of the income, so your portion of $1500 is $475 in rent, minus $400 credit, so you end up paying $75 out of pocket. \n\nHis parents paying for his insurance is separate and immaterial to a proportional split of shared expenses like rent.", "Girl, wtf are you doing???

NTA.", "NTA at all, it's not his employee discount.\n\nYou need to talk to him more about his expectations though because it sounds like he really doesn't appreciate all you have sacrificed for him so that he can earn the income he does and live where HE wants to.", "NTA but seriously, why are you with this guy? \nNot to be harsh but move back to the city and work on your self worth and self esteem.  No one should put up with this, ever.", "This guy is a dick.  NTA", "True, but that doesn't Chand the fact that OP's boyfriend is an ass.
