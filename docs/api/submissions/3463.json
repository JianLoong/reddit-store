{"id": 3463, "submission_id": "z78f00", "title": "AITA for kicking my family out of thanksgiving?", "selftext": "I submit my holiday drama to the judgment of Reddit.\n\nI (27F) have a kind of unusual profession in that I run a wildlife sanctuary and rehab center for wolves, coyotes, and birds of prey, mostly animals that have been surrendered or taken away from private owners or just can\u2019t go back to the wild for some reason.  I started working for the previous owner out of college and when he passed he willed the center, the house, and the surrounding land to me to take over since I was the most dedicated and successful at doing the work. Since I have a weird situation with my own family, he was also kind of Dad #2 to me, so I miss him a lot.\n\nMy family situation is weird because my parents split up when I was little, had other kids with other partners, and then remarried when I was 16, so I have four half-siblings, and they all resent me because my parents getting back together meant that theirs split up and my parents have always been way more attentive of them to make up for it, so I got the worst of both situations being the unwanted first marriage kid when they were divorced and then the ignored kid because of the half-siblings later.  I don\u2019t really stay close or visit much, partially because I need to be onsite to care for the animals, but I keep in touch.\n\nSo, the drama: now that some of the siblings are getting married and having kids, my parents\u2019 house is too small for big gatherings.  My house is the only one big enough to fit everyone, so my mom asked if we could do thanksgiving at my place. I was reluctant, but I figured maybe it would clear the air some so I agreed, plus the kids would get a kick out of the menagerie.\n\nThings were going fine until my sister (21F) showed up and started making \u201cjokes\u201d about how I\u2019ve taken \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d to the extreme and getting the other siblings to chime in. I tried to ignore it, but the jokes got meaner and when my mom said she liked the house my sister said \u201cMaybe I should get an older sugar daddy, it worked out well for OP.\u201d  I snapped and told her to get out. She didn\u2019t believe me so I got up, took her plate, grabbed her bag from the living room and told her to leave.  It probably helped that my big rescue wolf-dog heard my tone and came over to sit next to me, but she finally got up and started angrily getting her things. My parents protested, so I told them they could go, too.  After an argument, a threat to call the cops if they weren\u2019t gone within an hour, and my dog hackling up and growling when my brother put his hand on my shoulder, they finally left.\n\nNow they\u2019re mad because I ruined Thanksgiving for everyone, the kids were scared, I \u201csicced\u201c my \u201cpet wolf\u201d on them like a psycho, and overreacted to a joke. I feel bad for the kids, maybe I should have just taken it on the chin and not invited them back instead of kicking them out.\n\nEdit: Ok, I\u2019ll pay the wolf tax.

This is a common result of poor communication skills, and only serves to make the individual doing it appear to overreact to a situation that everyone else was fine because there was no reaction before.\n\nTreat yourself better OP. Set and enforce your boundaries early and consistently and don't let people walk over you, you deserve better.
