{"id": 3463, "submission_id": "z78f00", "title": "AITA for kicking my family out of thanksgiving?", "selftext": "I submit my holiday drama to the judgment of Reddit.\n\nI (27F) have a kind of unusual profession in that I run a wildlife sanctuary and rehab center for wolves, coyotes, and birds of prey, mostly animals that have been surrendered or taken away from private owners or just can\u2019t go back to the wild for some reason.  I started working for the previous owner out of college and when he passed he willed the center, the house, and the surrounding land to me to take over since I was the most dedicated and successful at doing the work. Since I have a weird situation with my own family, he was also kind of Dad #2 to me, so I miss him a lot.\n\nMy family situation is weird because my parents split up when I was little, had other kids with other partners, and then remarried when I was 16, so I have four half-siblings, and they all resent me because my parents getting back together meant that theirs split up and my parents have always been way more attentive of them to make up for it, so I got the worst of both situations being the unwanted first marriage kid when they were divorced and then the ignored kid because of the half-siblings later.  I don\u2019t really stay close or visit much, partially because I need to be onsite to care for the animals, but I keep in touch.\n\nSo, the drama: now that some of the siblings are getting married and having kids, my parents\u2019 house is too small for big gatherings.  My house is the only one big enough to fit everyone, so my mom asked if we could do thanksgiving at my place. I was reluctant, but I figured maybe it would clear the air some so I agreed, plus the kids would get a kick out of the menagerie.\n\nThings were going fine until my sister (21F) showed up and started making \u201cjokes\u201d about how I\u2019ve taken \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d to the extreme and getting the other siblings to chime in. I tried to ignore it, but the jokes got meaner and when my mom said she liked the house my sister said \u201cMaybe I should get an older sugar daddy, it worked out well for OP.\u201d  I snapped and told her to get out. She didn\u2019t believe me so I got up, took her plate, grabbed her bag from the living room and told her to leave.  It probably helped that my big rescue wolf-dog heard my tone and came over to sit next to me, but she finally got up and started angrily getting her things. My parents protested, so I told them they could go, too.  After an argument, a threat to call the cops if they weren\u2019t gone within an hour, and my dog hackling up and growling when my brother put his hand on my shoulder, they finally left.\n\nNow they\u2019re mad because I ruined Thanksgiving for everyone, the kids were scared, I \u201csicced\u201c my \u201cpet wolf\u201d on them like a psycho, and overreacted to a joke. I feel bad for the kids, maybe I should have just taken it on the chin and not invited them back instead of kicking them out.\n\nEdit: Ok, I\u2019ll pay the wolf tax.  The big white boi is my wolf-dog.

I have many trainer friends and have made a serious study of it for decades. A wolf-hybrid is not a joke, especially if it has given itself a job of protecting you - with children there!\n\nGoing forward, there should be much stricter rules of contact for your family no matter where you all are - because it was something of a clusterpunch.

She made the (admittedly common) mistake of not setting a boundary or correcting the actions and just \"trying to ignore it\", until it got to be too much and she snapped. This is a common result of poor communication skills, and only serves to make the individual doing it appear to overreact to a situation that everyone else was fine because there was no reaction before.\n\nTreat yourself better OP. Set and enforce your boundaries early and consistently and don't let people walk over you, you deserve better.

No, it's not fair or even logical because you exist and that's not going to change. This is all on them and their mental health. But, like all people who lack self awareness or perspective, they need a scapegoat to feel vindication or superiority. It's messed up.\n\nLife is too short to put any energy into these toxic morons. Keep doing what you're doing! If I ever win the lotto I'd probably be doing exactly what you're doing and looking out for a successor who can take over with the same kindness, respect and responsibility that you show those animals. Being an animal caretaker is not a walk in the park and it requires endless kindness and patience. \n\nFamily is what you make it. If they have fur, that doesn't make them any less family. Next Thanksgiving, make them all a special treat and let that be the focus of the day!\n\n I have regular house cats and am looking forward to a drama free Christmas with just my girls, because peace and comfort cannot be bought. If I have to suffer another stuffy, walking on eggshells, spending money I don't have, while being passive aggressively spoken down to by my sisters, event... only to appease my mother's fantasy of a loving close family.... I might scream! Life is too short for that crap!", "NTA \n\nUmmm\u2026 coolest job ever?? \nThey\u2019re SO cute. I\u2019m jealous!", "Nta. You were right to kick them out. They invited themselves over to use your house", "NTA and your pack is beautiful!", "NTA. Your house, your rules as many would say. Also being a host demands that you won't let guests run all over you. As well as a proper guest knows how to behave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut honestly, you seem like an awsome person, and your animal friends are probably in good hands. Who needs family if one has a true pack around!", "NTA\n\nNo one deserves to be disrespected in their own home.  You were right.\n\nAlso, Your whole life you've built sounds awesome.  I'm honestly kind of jealous.", "Good for you and your pupper. \n\nI had a mutt for years, part husky or something else with a pointy (vs round/barrel) chest that would growl if voices were raised. Or if a man came towards me in a manner he did not like. \n\nMy pupper was only 50lbs and thought he was a lap dog. But man, he was protective. He was best dog, as are yours! \n\nYour 4 legged friend knew what was up. So do you. Don't invite them back.\n\nNTA", "So NTA, and the animals are beautiful.  You didn't \"sic\" the dog on her.  The dog trusted you and felt you were upset and uncomfortable and stood up for you.", "NTA\n\nOooOoooOO!!  You have your very own Ghost Direwolf!  How beautiful!!", "Jon Snow over here", "Yeah I\u2019m with this person. NTA.", "ABSOLUTELY agree! Love the response.", "Frankly, this is the best part of this post.  Knowing that they actually expected you to host them overnight and none of the AHs would defend you so you kicked them out and now they had to scramble to find other housing.  Talk about ungrateful AHs.", "The relationship really matters.  When my sister and I joke about me being a crazy cat lady, I know she is joking, not judging.  When my brother jokes about me being a crazy cat lady it hits differently.  He feels more judgy about it.  These siblings were judging OP with their \"jokes\".", "You should post your website link. I'm in California not sure if your local.", "www.wolfeducation.org !", "I just cried laughing, thank you for this! Absolutely epic.", "If I ever get to Colorado! I'll pass it to a couple of people that are local.", "NTA.  When your sister started making jokes about you, did she say, \"with all due respect\" before she started being so rude to you?  Not that it would have mattered, but it would have been a bit more transparent that she was actually insulting you instead of being passive aggressive with you.\n\nI think you should probably go NC with siblings and LC with parents.  You don't need their toxicity and your mental health is way more important than hosting holiday celebrations that are more torture than celebration.", "NTA.  The kids saw a person stand up to bullying and kick it and anyone who defended it out even if those people were \u201celders\u201d.\n\nIt may have been scary but that\u2019s only bc they did not respect you the first time you told her to get out.  \n\nDo you know how important it is for a kid to see that happen?  Esp since you KNOW that someday someone in their family is going to be hurtful.  It takes away the power to manipulate kids into accepting bullying or forcing them into things they don\u2019t want to do.  \n\nIt can be done.  They saw it.  They also now know not to accept \u201cjokes\u201d like that.  I say it was a teachable moment for all involved.", "NTA, and also wanted to let you know you have my dream job. I tried to do the same but have so much debt to pay off. I ended up working in general practice instead, with kitten rescue at home...but I still dream of someday going into wildlife medicine. \n\nI'm sorry you had to become so strong without your parents' and siblings' support, but I'm also so proud of you for not letting your blood family denigrate your chosen family, including your second father. You're a hero to so many animals and an inspiration for the rest of us.", "NTA. How dare they suggest those things to you IN YOUR OWN HOUSE.", "thanksgiving is a terrible holiday anyways, can\u2019t ruin what\u2019s already broken", "NTA No way.  No howl! (see what I did there?)\n\nI envy your life living with all the critters .  Prefer my critters any day to a bunch of humans.", "NTA - You did good, this epic expulsion gonna make them never go back (If this is the real intention I guess)", "I came here to say something similar. NTA", "The dog came in to investigate the raised voices and sat down next to me.  He growled when my brother grabbed my shoulder, but other than that he was calm and obeyed a down command immediately, so at no point did I call him over or incite him.  He\u2019s had a lot of socialization training, but few even purely domestic dogs are going to react well to their person being grabbed at.", "\"but few even purely domestic dogs are going to react well to their person being grabbed at.\"\n\n100% THIS.\n\nMy dog is trained, stands by my side when walking even off lead, comes to me when called, doesn't run off after animals in the wood etc, and if my wife gets a touch too \"rough\" (In my dog's opinion) he will stand between me and her and shiba whine when she gets too close.\n\nAnd yes, he will do the same to me if I do the same thing to my wife.\n\nBTW NTA", "\u2018Crazy cat lady\u2019 my arse, it seems like your centre is amazing and you\u2019re doing some great work there.
