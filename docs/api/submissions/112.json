My husband and I tried to talk with my in laws about their behavior. My MIL spiraled and began yelling at us. She said that if we cannot accept my FIL for who he is, we never loved him in the first place. My FIL then jumped all over us saying more disrespectful things and said we do not deserve an apology. The whole thing because very dramatic on my in law\u2019s part and ended with my MIL yelling \u201cf&$k you\u201d to my husband. We have decided to listen to you all and we will be going NC with them. This only upset my MIL further, saying that we\u2019re taking her grandchild away from her. She them promptly blocked us on everything. So as a result, we will not be allowing my in laws to see our daughter. I don\u2019t believe that this can be resolved or fixed. Thank you all for your input!\n\n\nOriginal post:\n\nI (28f) have been married to my (34m) husband for 3 years now, together for 6. My husband has a 14 year old daughter from his first marriage, who I absolutely adore. The first 5 years of our relationship, I had a great relationship with my in laws. We spent a lot of time with them and saw them every weekend. The issue started two weeks ago when my FIL asked about my stepdaughter\u2019s soccer team and the workouts that she goes through. I explained her very busy soccer schedule and he then said that we need to make her run more because she is fat. For reference, my stepdaughter is 5\u20193 and 125lbs. She\u2019s very athletic and plays multiple sports. I was incredibly offended by this and said \u201cexcuse me?\u201d He then repeated it multiple times. I told him that he will not speak about our daughter that way and I hung up on him. I told my husband what happened and he confronted his dad. It turned into a huge argument because he did not see an issue with this statement. My MIL got involved as well and was originally on our side of things. It\u2019s now been 2 weeks since this incident. Both of my in laws are now saying that we\u2019re overreacting and dramatic about the situation. She also said that we need to be better parents because we\u2019re teaching her to be dramatic.

Many AITA stories start with an acrimonious exchange where both parties give offense, but because the offenses are perceived differently, one or both party decides the disagreement cannot be resolved without an apology, which the other party will not give. And then the disagreement become an unhealed festering wound and destroys the relationship.\n\nIn this case we all agree the FIL gave the initial offense and we all agree that OP was right to call him on it. And *then* we diverge: apparently OP and her husband did not think what OP said sufficiently expressed their outrage or sufficiently chastised the FIL or OP's husband decided he needed to get into it also (OP is welcome to jump in and clarify). The double response, or the perseverated response, or something, seemed so over-the-top to FIL and MIL that they decided they had a grievance as well. So now there were 4 angry adults calibrating, not just the original offense, but the responses, and they have apparently decided that there is still enough of an offense inequity that it outweighs their previously good relationship and apologies are required to resume the good relationship.\n\nIf this were two teenagers arguing over some remark that violated a social norm they need not ever interact with each other again and there would be little cost to either. But these putative adults are related to each other and this involves children and these idiots are willing to disrupt a good family relationship over competing verbal offenses of tone or length or repetition or whatever. How much of a \"good relationship\" did they have if they were all willing to dissolve it over this offense imbalance.\n\nFinally, let me respond to all the downvotes and incur some more. I infer the average redditor comes from a poor family and does not understand that among the differences between good and poor families are *good will* and *good faith*. Good will is a generally positive emotion toward a relative with a willingness to share, to take a little trouble, to overlook small transgressions, to forgive easily. Good faith is an underlying assumption that another person's overall motives are good, and a willingness to put a better construction, rather than a worse one, on an action that could be interpreted more than one way. Both often require that minor imbalances of offense remain unsettled because maintaining the relationship is more important. I see neither good will nor good faith in OP's story. The downvotes suggest to me that a lot of redditors don't have much of either in their relationships.", "Sorry, but \"chunky as fuck\" does not translate to me as being concerned about their health.\n\nMore like body shaming.  At least you had the decency not to mention it.\n\nAnd NO the parent is not blind.", "Thank you!!", "I just hate the whole \"deserve\" concept, and find \"you deserve each other\" insufferably smug and pretentious.  So thanks for your rambling scride that seems to be something about good will and your superiority to us commoners (didn't bother reading much) and answer my question: what do you believe you deserve?", "Thank you the lesson in sophistry and it\u2019s quite pathetic tbh. You are the asshole in this thread.", "Well\u2026if they weren\u2019t blind, they\u2019re surely not doing anything to rectify it. No diets. They were scarfing down cupcakes and muffins and asking for 3rds", "Sure.  Blow in from out of state for the weekend and solve all their parenting issues for them.  You have no idea what else this family might be dealing with.\n\nBeing overweight in YOUR eyes was simply not these people's #1 ( or #2 or #3) priority.\n\nAnd for all you know, they WERE on strict diets but decided to give the kids a break because of their GUESTS.", "I mean health should always be a top priority", "The pandemic/lockdown/ remote schooling was hard on everyone.  Academic issues. Social issues. Mental issues. Perhaps they even lost a family member."]}
