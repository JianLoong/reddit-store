We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.  \n\n\nIn high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother. \n\n  \nMy sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.   \n\n\nLast weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699578620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rsddh/aita_for_ignoring_my_husband_after_he_embarrassed/", "score": 3722, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its long gone and neither of you even care. she could have mentioned him as her friend or bf.\n\nsecondly, his behavior was atrocious and should be discussed at length with a therapist. Hes obviously feeling insecure and realized that yes you did have a whole life and relationships before him, and your life didnt just magically start when you met him.\n\nthirdly, you need to figure out if you can forgive him and move past this. Is this something that will happen again and again, or will this be a one off for him. will the marriage recover or will it be too hard to look at him every day.\n\nHis behavior was horrible and he really needs to speak to someone and find out why he reacted the way he did. You didnt mention dan for the simple reason that hes not an important part of your life, nor was the relationship noteworthy to mention. couples share exs, but not everyone does nor do they need to.\n\nyour husband may be feeling insecure but hes definitely realized you had a life before him. couples counseling could be great.", "No one is pointing out that the *sister* is the real AH here. Why on earth, after a decade, would she purposely introduce Dan as OP's ex if not to purposely stir shit up? And conveniently while OP wasn't in the vicinity to give the correct context.", "ESH. If you know your ex appears frequently during family gatherings why would you not want to give your partner a heads up. Even though you felt like it wasn\u2019t a big deal it probably seems like you hid it from him. \n\nAlso what will giving him the silent treatment accomplish? Your husband shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way at all. He was wrong for that. Better communication might\u2019ve resolved this.", "NTA First of all I don't see why your sister felt the need to introduce him as your ex. It was a highschool relationship, not like you guys were going to get married or something. Secondly, your husband is not entitled to know about every relationship of your life. He completely overreacted and became unhinged.", "NTA. His apology should be as public as his outburst.", "NTA. Nothing you did justified his unhinged, abusive behavior. \nDid he call you the W word or the S word in front of your family? Because I could never forgive that. Knowing my family would remember what he said and how he humiliated me every time they saw him would be too much.", "NTA- your guy sounds mean and controlling. Even if Dan was only your ex and not your sisters friend, you didn\u2019t invite him to this party. \n\nIf your husband got in his feelings, he should have pulled you aside before going absolutely OFF on you in front of your family. What a fucking tool. You should be really careful of someone whose going to call you names, especially in public- it\u2019s a huge red flag and makes you wonder what they\u2019ll say and do in private.", "ESH - the cold shoulder is immature. Him yelling at you was immature. Especially him calling you names. He's entitled to be upset. He's not entitled to take that anger out on you in such a way.   \n\n\nI get why you didn't tell him about Dan, it was years ago, it was over and you two have zero romantic feelings for each other. It probably didn't occur to you because of that. But I also get why your husband felt blindsided.   \n\n\nYou two need to sit down and talk like mature adults. You should apologize for childishly ignoring him but let him know the way he spoke to you is absolutely not acceptable.", "ESH. He overreacted and behaved inappropriately. And sister probably didn\u2019t need to introduce him like that. That being said, in 4 years of a relationship where your ex attends a lot of family gatherings, it\u2019s never come up? He is a little justified in being annoyed at being caught off guard, and probably had a very awkward and unnecessary conversation with your sister, that could\u2019ve been avoided.", "ESH\n\n>My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him. \n\n>At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex.\n\nAnd, from your statement about Dan:\n\n>He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings. \n\nHe never gets to go to family gatherings, finally goes to one, and is immediately given the impression that you've still been hanging out with your ex while he \"works a very demanding job\"?!?!?  I'm kinda on your husband's side at first.  He was *intentionally* given the impression that Dan was still in the picture. \n\nWhich brings the question: Why the fuck would your sister do that?\n\nYour sister instigated it. He blew up. You're ignoring him.\n\nAll of you suck.", "NTA and I don\u2019t think he embarrassed u but embarrassed himself", "Definitely not!\nYou have every right to not engage with anyone who disrespects you \nEspecially your mate.\nHe definitely was not acting like your friend at the moment.\nSorry that this happened to you. \nBeen that, done there.\ud83e\udd8b\u270c\ufe0f", "over a high school boyfriend that's happily dating your sister\n\ni don't know what the hell is wrong with your husband but you're NTA if you need time to regroup after such a display", "NTA He called you names, in front of your family, because of something long dead and gone??? You have every right to give him silent treatment for that. If he cannot have a proper convo about how he feels about the situation without resorting to name calling then you can't talk like an adult either.", "NTA Wow, he really fucked up here. This can\u2019t be taken back. And yes being publicly treated like that is humiliating. You have every right to be upset. I can\u2019t believe people get so upset over high school relationships. Your husband may have just sealed his fate in the eyes of your family. I also don\u2019t think it was right your sister referred to him as your ex. That was so odd to me. Like why?", "NTA but your sister, who orchestrated the drama certainly is, and your husband\u2019s reaction was juvenile and not easily forgiven or forgotten. He needs to grow up and apologize for his over the top outburst to you and then to your family. If you plan on having kids the man needs therapy first. If there were children present when he called you horrible names it is doubtful your family will forgive and forget. I feel bad for you. This type of reaction over a long ago high school relationship is a serious red flag. He thinks you are not trustworthy? That is rich. I wouldn\u2019t trust his behavior to not escalate further.", "NTA, and I would divorce someone for calling me names in front of my family. Who does that?\n\nGet out now before you have kids with this guy and he demonstrates that anger towards\u2014or in front of\u2014 your kids.", "NTA. Your husband is. That behavior is unacceptable. Calling you names and in front of your family?\nAlso, why don't you attend birthday parties? Is it just birthday parties or do you not go to a lot of family gatherings because of your husband? The fact that you had to ASK him to agree to go to your own mother's birthday is fucking wild. \nYour sister first knew Dan as your ex. Sure she didn't need to introduce them that way but your husband is way out of line. Like...yikes.  I'm sure he was going to find out about Dan at some point since your sister brings him around. Are you not allowed to have had a past? I don't understand anybody anymore lol Who cares? You had a life before you met your husband...probably a better one.", "NTA. Im so confused what the issue is. He knows you didn\u2019t spring fully formed from the earth - do you know all the woman he\u2019s been with since high school ? Plus even if he feels some kind of way why curse you out in public ?", "ESH\n\nYou should have given him a heads up. It might not seem relevant to you, but your husband was blindsided with your ex at an event. One you knew they\u2019d cross paths at. He was blindsided with his existence, his presence, and the knowledge that you\u2019ve been seeing him regularly at these events that your husband hasn\u2019t been able to attend. And with the knowledge that you\u2019ve never, not once, mentioned it to him.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have lost it at you that way in front of that audience. But it depends on what he actually said - you didn\u2019t give examples. Not sure you\u2019re a reliable narrator.", "INFO - you say you don't normally attend birthdays - why?\n\nI think your husband is the asshole for his behaviour at the party, but I'm wondering how long you plan on ignoring him (since that's what you're asking whether you're the asshole about doing). You are married to him and you live together, right? Your embarrassment and anger may be justified, but you do need to plan for a resolution at some point.", "NTA Find another BF who is a real adult.", "NTA. HE can't trust you??? You now can't trust him not to call you awful names, to hurt you in front of others!!! He can be surprised. He can not like that a part of your history wasn't told to him -b/c it was insignificant to you. There is a time and place for emotional discussions, and in front of your family isn't one!  His reaction is over the top. I wouldn't be able to have a calm discussion with him for a while, either. Definitely a loss of trust - on your side- that he will protect your feelings, your heart, your love.", "NTA. I\u2019m\nSo sorry OP\u2014this sounds awful.", "NTA but why would your sister introduce her bf whom she is very close with as your ex to your husband? Either she is a trouble maker or thought she was being funny, either way she TA. Your husband was also one because of his reaction and embarrassing you. But find out why your sis did what she did", "Your sister doesn\u2019t have two brain cells to run together. What a silly thing to do. \n\nYour husbands reaction is OTT.  \n\nNTA", "Your husband is both immature and insecure\u2026\n\nPathetic\u2026", "Whoa\u2026 this is huge reg flag. NTA.", "NTA. thats some peaked in high school shit.", "ESH. While your husbands reaction and name calling was gross, it also seems strange that you never once mentioned Dan to him and how you two had known each other, that in the intervening years after your relationship, your sister had become very good friends with him. Communication could have stopped this whole situation with him, and it will do better to communicate with him now instead of ignoring him.", "Did he think you just sprang from the ground pastless and fully-formed when he was ready to meet you?\n\nNTA. Hubby and your sister are though.  She couldn't have just introduced him as her friend Dan....because that's the capacity he was there in.  Is she a shit-stirrer often?", "ESH \n\nHe didn't need to go off on you in front of your loved ones but I definitely see why he was angry with you. You should have told him about the high likelihood of running into your ex that you had a year long relationship with. He should not have had to hear that from your sister. Wouldn't you be caught off guard too?", "NTA-it was  but why did your sister introduce him like that?  Since he was there as her friend and guest.\n\nAny animosity there? Is she dating him?", "NTA", "NTA HOWEVER your sister kind of is and your husband handled it poorly. With that said the guy was blind sided by your sister. I would certainly hope my wife would give me a heads up on a past relationship, especially if there were sexual/intimacy no matter how long ago it was. A simple hey an old family friend I used to date seriously 5 years ago is going to be there just so you know.", "Mmm. His reaction seems like a bit much. Is it possible you've mentioned Dan a lot before or that he knows he was at other events and yet you never told him about your history? Regardless, he needs to learn how to control his emotions and Apologize to your family and to you. Also your sister is a damn instigator, I'd have a talk with her too, with is her deal. NTA assuming you aren't omitting some information.", "F\u00a5\u00a5\u00a5\u00a5\u00a5ck that !!! And your sister did you dirty on purpose.", "I just think how would you have felt if the roles were reversed? Would you be comfortable with hubs\u2019 ex sprung on you at a family gathering? \n\nAlso hubs didn\u2019t need to have a public tantrum about it. \n\nESH\u2026", "NTA, but he should have been introduced as BF of sister.", "YTA (or at least, I get why your husband is mad) // Maybe ESH depending on what he said.\n\nIf Dan is so close w/ your sister that he attends FAMILY events (like - this isn't your sister's birthday party, it's your mom's) then your husband should 100% know who he is if you dated for a year.\n\nIt would be different if you went on 3 dates and it fizzled.  It would be different if he was some ex you had zero percent chance of ever bumping into.\n\nYour husband isn't reacting to the fact that you once upon a time had a boyfriend in high school. He is reacting to the fact that you never prepared him and thoroughly blindsided him, and the fact he has to learn this from sister / ex-boyfriend. Why didn't you just tell him, at any time in the past 4 years, there was a strong likelihood of bumping into your high school bf at some point. (Similarly, how many events did husband NOT attend that Dan did... again, lying by omission!)\n\n> he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore\n\nYeah, b/c you lied to him for 4 years before he was blindsided at a family event.\n\n>I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.\n\nFirst, you stonewall, then HE is apologizing. Why is he apologizing?  For the words he used? You should be apologizing for the four years of lying.\n\nLook, I'm a fellow straight woman... This is something you tell your partner.", "ESH. Mostly him for acting like a toddler, but it was not nice of you to let an ex be sprung on him like this. If the ex is seriously dating your sister you had to know their paths would cross at some point. I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s any excuse for letting it be sprung on him as a surprise.", "NTA high-school relationships don\u2019t count unless you lasted beyond high-school. End of. \n\nYour husband way overreacted for a thing you had with someone as a literal child. One of my friends dates my fianc\u00e9 in high school but I didn\u2019t know them both until college and all three of us constantly forget it even happened.", "ESH\n\nBut mostly you do. You should have given your husband a heads up so he wouldn\u2019t have been blindsided like that.", "Who are all these insecure people saying this us her fault? I didn\u2019t give a rundown of my X\u2019s to my husband. Just the usual \u201cthey are X\u2019s for a reason\u201d and that\u2019s fine. \n\nNTA.", "ESH. He acted like a huge asshole. Inappropriate to the max. But so did and are you. YOU should\u2019ve warned him about Dan. That\u2019s your damn husband! Show him some respect by informing him of shit like that! You legit let him walk in blind! How much more of a low asshole can you be?!! \n\nYou are just as bad as him. YOU owe him an apology too. The fact that you don\u2019t think you did anything wrong is disgusting.", "YTA. Both for not telling your husband about your ex hanging out with your family all these years and for the silent treatment. He reacted like that because he was blindsided and hearing news like that from someone else when you had all the opportunity in the world to tell him impacted his trust in you. He did overreact but I understand why so instead of being immature about it with the silent treatment you should apologise to each other and stop being so weirdly secretive.", "NTA I hope this doesn\u2019t turn out to be a case where it was really all about something else. So many stories where one spouse makes a mountain out of a molehill and it turns out they want out of the marriage for other reasons, usually an affair. There\u2019s no way a previously rational spouse goes nuts over the existence of an ex unless something else is going on.", "People that project that hard usually have something else going on. Cheaters always accuse their partners of cheating.", "ESH. You for keeping this info from him. It was bound to reach him from some channel. Better would've been from you. If your ex is so attached to your family, and in relationship with your sis, even if you don't care for it, that doesn't make it insignificant info for your husband. Had there been no proximity with your ex, it could be said that you don't have tonshare details of all your past relationships with him. But that's not the case here. I am curious to know why you hid this info. Missing missing reasons here. \n\nYour sister for getting into things that are not her business. It's your prerogative to share info about your past relationships with your husband. \n\nYour husband for lacking patience and tact to take this conversation in private, and understand from you why you felt the need to keep this info from him. May be It's his anger issues that stop you from being open with him. May be you've pulled off similar things in the past, and that day was the last straw for him. More info is required.", "NTA, my wife has put me in a similar situation, but she genuinely doesn't see it as a big deal, and I accept that - the woman is perfect.\n\nIt's not a great feeling to experience. And we discussed it privately afterwards.\n\nYour husband is TA for speaking to you like that in front of everyone. It's completely unacceptable, imho.", "Exactly *how* did your sister introduce Dan? If it was a simple, \"yeah, he and OP dated a *long* time ago, but he's been mine for awhile now\" is a lot different than \"yeah, OP carried quite the torch for Dan here for years after they broke up. I'm not sure she really got over him - too bad, he's mine now.\" One would be understandable of a little doubt, the other would mean it was completely an overreaction. Neither excuses his behavior.\n\nAsk him what was going through his head that justified his behavior and why he thinks you should forgive him? He acted this way once, you need to find out why and if he'll act that way again.\n\nNTA.", "ESH....\n\nthe husband acted immature and no excuse for that..\n\nbut this information regarding ex may seem \"minor\" or insignificant detail to some...to others it may be a big deal and important information.\n\nsometimes its bad to ASS-U-ME", "So he only started getting crude when you made excuses for error, he had the right to be upset by your lie by omission, and you madebit wsy worse. Way to take ownership of your actions or lack thereof. Then, the silent treatment, why? because he embarrassed you for that lie and your unwillingness to own your actions. \n\nSo for all of the above - YTA\n\nFor losing his temper, he is the AH. But this whole chain of events is due to you and your actions. \n\nSo, why aren't you trying to apologize as well. \n\nGood luck on making it to your 5th anniversary, you are going to need it, with your capacity to deny your culpability for your actions.", "NTA. I don't get all the votes telling you otherwise, of course your super upset since the party, it's not like you can pretend otherwise. His behaviour was absolutely atrocious, the kind of atrocious that takes a lot - a lot of time and a lot of action on his part - to forgive. And I disagree with everyone saying you should have warned him - you didn't because there is 0 to be concerned with. How could you have predicted your husband would become unhinged. Jesus.", "ESH. I feel like your sister is the biggest asshole, honestly. She was trying to cause drama and that was what happened.\n\nYour husband is an asshole for the way he reacted and humiliated you in front of your family and friends. His apology means nothing if he won't publicly apologize for each person who was also at the party for causing this much drama. Apologizing to you in private is not even the minimum, since he called you names publicly.\n\nYou were a bit of an asshole for not warning him. Just because you don't care that he is your ex and is close to your sister and family does not mean this information is not important for your husband. Ignoring him is also not helping anything.\n\nSit him down and tell him you would like him to apologize to your friends and family, before you are able to consider his apology. If he refuses to apologize to them, then you will have another problem, there.", "ESH but the biggest AH is your sister. Why would she introduce someone you dated for less than a year forever ago that she has a thing with CURRENTLY as your ex? Family friend has been true longer. Her significant other is more accurate to who he is now. Either way, she absolutely sucks and I cannot fathom she was doing anything but trying to start stuff. I'd have a talk with her. Is she jealous you used to date him? Is she hung up or thinking he's still hung up on you? What's her issue?\n\nYour husband drastically overreacted and there is no justification for him to treat you like that. Him being upset is understandable, as he likely felt like you hid something from him. I would feel a bit betrayed to not know, it's just how it is. But it should have been a conversation after the fact that it wasnt cool you didnt tell him, not an explosion during. \n\nThat being said, you really should have told him knowing it's someone who is at a lot of family functions, it's fair he felt blindsided. I can't imagine how it never was mentioned. Did you never have the who you may meet at X family gathering convos as a couple? Where you briefly describe your family/people? Maybe not everyone does that. You are least amount of AH in this situation.", "NTA. Dan is history, high school history. Someone who trusts you and values himself wouldn't jump to the conclusion that you've cheated on him or lied to him. And someone who values you and your relationship wouldn't insult you and call you names, much less do so in public at a family member's celebration.\n\nI'd have a really hard time coming back from this, OP. At a minimum, I'd need an apology from him, along with apologies to the people present at his blow up; an explanation of what twisted logic led him to believe that behavior was appropriate as well as deserved; and marriage counseling for him to learn how to handle discomfort as an effing adult.\n\nGood luck to you, OP.", "Soft YTA. If Dan is at the party as your sister\u2019s friend, why the f*ck she introduce him as YOUR EX?

We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.  \n\n\nIn high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother. \n\n  \nMy sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.   \n\n\nLast weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And he\u2019s pissed. I wonder why. He may have overreacted, but he was going to react. It wasn\u2019t fair for that to be thrown in his face at a place that\u2019s supposed to be his family gathering too.

Since he works all the time he hasn't had the same opportunity to bond with your family that your ex who you've known since high school has. It makes sense that he would feel jealous and alienated, and I think you knew or suspected that he felt that way (or should have) but asked him \"what's wrong?\" instead, pretending that you didn't know why he was feeling that way, and then that he was wrong to feel that way. Even grown men shouldn't be made to feel ashamed of their feelings. But then he let his anger take control and he treated you absolutely terribly, in front of your family.

OP absolutely should have given him a heads up. It's easy to think that it's a piece of information that doesn't matter when you only think about how you feel about it, and think that everyone else should feel that way too, and that's not fair at all. \n\nAnd the point you bring about a serious/sexual relationship is actually pretty important. While yes, people can move past it and have it not mean anything. At the same time that period of your life is one of critical growth and experiences that begin to shape you you are. Experiences filled with all kinds of thoughts, emotions, and hormones. And those things can and do absolutely resurface in some people! And there's nothing wrong with them resurfacing, it's a normal part of life. \n\nBut if you pair the potential for resurfacing with hiding (even if by omission) the intimate nature of your old relationship with someone you see often. It's totally understandable why the husband would feel anxiety and doubt at the revelation. Especially one that comes from a 3rd party in an environment where they have no time to process anything. (not saying I agree with his behavior, because I don't, I just understand where the emotions come from). \n\nPlus even if OOP doesn't feel anything about it, that doesn't mean her ex doesn't.

Which doesn't mean you shouldn't trust the guy, but you shouldn't be ignorant of the possibility either). Many giant life altering mistakes have been made by putting yourself in a bad/temptating position, trusting only in your willpower to overcome it. \n\nSo much could be solved by open communication and putting actual effort to understand eachothers thoughts and feelings, which are two vital parts to a healthy relationship.

Otherwise she's hiding things from him. /s\n\nMore seriously, you ever consider that OP might find talking about her history with this guy embarrassing and awkward? I can safely say that when I'm in a room with previous partners it's *not* thinking about the past that keeps the situation from getting weird. That all goes in a box in the corner of my mind. Sounds like OP's wired the same way. \n\nNone of  that changes that you don't get to go nuclear because a guy your wife had sex with as a teenager turns out to be in the room. The husband is an ass, period. Being jealous might be a human thing, but how you handle it says a lot about you.", ">This man was literally her first \n\nSo? Her virginity hasn't left some magic stain on his dong that will draw her back to him.

I make no claims to being the world's most mature and well adjusted person. I still don't go nuclear like this at family gatherings. And with my extended family being as screwed up as they are I can assure you that I've been exposed to some pretty serious provocation at said gatherings. \n\nIf your reaction to being blindsided by something is to start calling your wife names, you've got problems you haven't addressed.", "Why not? Whole thing seems hypothetical.", "People can have pasts without partners getting jealous.", "That's the issue. Op should have mentioned her ex is so enmeshed with her family. She would like to know if it was the other way", "They've been married 2 years and everything was great up until this one spot and were already jumping on the idea of him being abusive? Slow your horses buddy", "Well seeing as she has been ignoring him since, that tells me that he maybe felt that he wanted to express this in an environment where she could not ignore him for telling her how he felt.  \n\n\nThe feeling here is that she often might be doing the girly thing where she ignores him whenever she feels that he is bringing up something that upsets her or makes her uncomfortable instead of discussing it with him.   \n\n\nStill not the time or the place for him to bring it up, but when he feels that she won't communicate stuff to him he might, in his dissapointment, have been thinking this was his best \"course of action\" to get his feelings across to her in an environment where she could not just brush it off and ignore him straight away.", "Red flags on why there were secrets that the entire family knows except hubby. I might be miffed too.", "He yelled at her and called her horrible names at her mother's birthday, in front of her whole family, for having 1 high school.boyfriend who her sister is still friendly with.  That's unhinged.\n\nI'm glad he's sorry, but sorry doesn't really cut it now, does it?  I don't think I could get past this.

I'd be horrified.", ">We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together.\n\nIf what OP says above is true, then there is no way that OP forgot about her ex, even is she had not seen or heard from him in 8 years. Let alone the ex being constantly present in the family.\n\nOP is definitely hiding something.\n\nOP's ex seems to be close friend to the family. If the ex was already well know to the family when OP was dating him, there is not need to ostracize him unless he was a bad person or OP objected to him being around.", "I understand the spirit of that condition and it feels good to say things like that but I've got to be honest if my partner told me that was what constituted a proper apology I don't think I would ever apologise. Publicly embarrass myself once shame on me, try and force me to publicly embarrass myself twice on the same issue... not going to happen.", "Yet he's still going to family events. That is way more than \"just friends\". I've never gone to any friend's mother's birthday, especially an ex's mother's birthday.\n\nAnd this isn't just any ex, this is an \"a lot of our first experiences with some things were together\" ex.\n\nAnd if my math is correct, he's been attending these events for longer than OP has known her husband. Yet he's never come up. You would have to actively avoid mentioning him if OP talks to her husband about anything that happened at her family's events. Even if OP doesn't attend the birthdays, it sounds like she does attend other family events.", "I don't know. I feel like in that hypothetical I would still give my wife a heads up. What if she learns you were engaged before for the 1st time by a stranger?", "I'm a lawyer.  I'm curious in what jurisdiction you live where what OP described may be a criminal act?", "So hiding him for four years is better?", ">I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. **We have been together for 4 years in total.**\n\nPresumably in those 4 years, Dan and OP\u2019s sisters friendship was a thing.", "Sister might have brought it up because husband is a controlling jealous weirdo that the wife keeps excusing. She is after all asking if she\u2019s the asshole for being angry her husband yelled at her and called her names in front of her family. He sounds abusive af. He acted that way in front of her parents. What is he like behind closed doors? Normal people don\u2019t react like that.", ">She's not a good wife for hiding this, they possibly had sex.\n\nOh no, she had sex with someone else eight years before she met her current husband. Who gives a shit?", "We can all agree that OP\u2019s sister a fuckin weird at the least. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s with her sister\u2019s ex. That\u2019s so tacky", ">Don\u2019t people discuss their past history with each other before they get married?! \n\nNo. Secure people don't quiz each other about how many people they've screwed in the past.

OP didn't lie to her husband. She neglected to tell him that when she was in high school she and an old family friend had awkward teenage sex in the back of a car. Seriously, people in this thread are way over-romanticizing high school age sex. It's usually pretty lousy, which is why people don't hang onto the memory. I say this as someone who is married to my high school girlfriend.", "Fully agreed.I'm really surprised. How people think it is irrelevant. Especially since the ex is kind of adopted in the family and the entire family knows it.", "Op clearly says she never told him, stop making shit up to help her because you *want* her to be morally right.", "But only married for 2. You think I told my gf everything before we got married?", "In your guess the older sister knows way more about her BIL at around 4 years. But the younger sister would be clueless about how the older sister acts after only 26 years of being sisters\u2026got it. Either the older sister loves drama or she thought her younger sister would have told the husband by now.", "Words aren\u2019t violent?  Do you realize there\u2019s quite a few crimes considered violent with only the use of words?", "Verbal abuse is also called verbal violence. It's less common but not wrong to use the word violence that way.", "If someone is yelling at you, cursing you out and calling you degrading names all while towering over you it is violent. \n\nOkay let's say someone screams and their kids that they'll beat their ass, kids a loser piece of shit and slammed their hand on the table.\n\nSorry, but that's violent. It inflicts fear.", "It is in a thesaurus' synonym list because people who are violent are, most/all of the time, aggressive, and people who are aggressive _can_ be violent at the same time. \n\nThat doesn't mean they have the same meaning. English doesn't have many true synonyms in the first place, and this isn't one of them.", "Neglecting to tell is hiding.\n\nAlso i doubt they went into details when the introduced Dan.", "I doubt you did, and would be surprised and suspicious if you had claimed to. However, while I didn\u2019t tell my wife everything about my past before we were married (or afterwards for that matter), I did in fact make sure that she knew of the ones whom she may have reason to meet, or whom have significant connections to family.", "No, in my guess the older sister is horribly wrong in her assessment of BIL.", "Because you're afraid of what he'll do besides the yelling right? Afraid that he'll hit you or hurt you physically?", "Once you get into crimes things are different, because legal terms can have different meanings than words used in common terms. \n\nExamples:\n\n\"To concur.\"\n\nIn plain English, it is a formal way of saying \"to agree.\"\nIn the Supreme Court usage, it means: \"I agree with what the other Judge decided, but for completely different reasons...\" And a long and detailed list of those reasons will follow.\n\n\"Slander.\"\n\nIn plain English: it means to say insulting things about someone else publicly so to damage his/her reputation.\nIn legal usage: if I know these things I say about you are false, only then does my saying them become slander.\nAlso, people say \"slander\" when they mean \"libel.\" The distinction is that libel is done in a newspaper, on the radio, on television, or over the Internet. Lawyers always make that distinction. Lay persons like me do not always do so.\n\nDamages and injuries\n\nIn common parlance, damage indicates physical or mental harm caused. In legalese, damages connotes \"the amount given as compensation to a person\".\n\nIn contradistinction, an injury is largely believed to be akin to a damage. However, in law, an injury has a specific connotation: \"an adverse impact on the legal rights of one\".", "Yes but I 'm pretty sure his yelling messed me up, too. Even in trivial situations I expect a disproportionate reaction from the other person. He also has a habit of backing me into a corner or getting into my personal space. Phisical violence is often preceded by verbal violence. I agree that verbal abuse is not always the same as violence, but there are situations in which those two overlap.", "Op didn\u2019t \u201ccreate the situation\u201d by asking her husband what was wrong when he was obviously acting distant to her during a family gathering causing him to curse her out in front of her family, so let\u2019s just drop that idea right there. Her sister sucks for introducing the guy that way and the husband sucks for his reaction but OP wasn\u2019t maliciously withholding info from him and didn\u2019t deserve his reaction.", "So we agree that the actual violence doesn't come until after the verbal abuse and that he's probably given you ptsd in those types of situations. \n\nI'm not defending yelling at people nor am I saying it's not abusive. It's just not violent.", "I don\u2019t understand why no one is commenting on this: couples look after each other and don\u2019t ask what\u2019s wrong w each other in public. \n\n1)Your husband wasn\u2019t doing well at a rare party. He blew you off and didn\u2019t answer when you asked him what was wrong. News flash: Something was wrong! You knew it! but didn\u2019t pursue hard to allow him space\u2026 good job there. Don\u2019t know if this was in public though\u2026 if it was that may have been why he didn\u2019t answer you at the time. \n\n2) During dinner, in full public you again asked him what was wrong. Throwing a spotlight on his angst and know long well that \u201csomething was wrong\u201d before you asked.\n\nWhat recourse did he have: lie and be gracious, up and leave, or fight back. You had him backed into a corner and decided to expose his pain to your family in public. You really didn\u2019t care what was wrong or you would have asked him privately. You just wanted him to act better and calling him out in public was a form of manipulation. YTA \n\nHe responded very very badly, that\u2019s on him, so ESH. But completely absent the drama/context that led to this, you were shitty to him in front of others. You knew better. You should have waited for later or taken him aside to ask how he was doing rather than calling out his pain in public. Super immature. \n\nNow you are using another very immature conflict style of ignoring him. What do you hope to achieve there? He\u2019s already apologised. Again YTA.\n\nFrankly the Dan was your ex lying by omission thing that many people have called out is also YTA, but others have already addressed that.\n\nYou need to apologise for backing him into a corner in public, trying to manipulate him into feeling better, and for lying all that time. I wouldn\u2019t trust you either.\n\nYou both need to do some serious soul searching here and if you don\u2019t upgrade your conflict resolution skills your marriage is doomed. \n\nESH get marriage counselling, life can be way better!!\n\nPs\u2014\u2014\n\nAlso, your sister is knife twisting. Even if it was totally friendly and innocent (see other posts on why it wasn\u2019t) she introducing Dan as your ex Without You Being Present.

Get help.", " ESH Yes, a-holes abound here!\n\nIn descending order: \n\n1. You suck for not telling your husband about Dan. Period. Do you plan on staying married to him? Yes? Then talk to him. You can\u2019t ignore him forever. \n\n2. WTF is wrong with your sister to introduce the guy like that?!! And why aren\u2019t you upset with her?! She must have really enjoyed that scene at dinner. \n\n3. The biggest a-hole in the room is clearly your husband, for not holding it together until you got home. Holy crap!!

Him disrespecting you especially in front of others is a real bad look for him and needs to be a serious conversation. He also needs to show you remorse for how he insulted you. \n\nI would recommend sitting down and telling each other more about yourselves and your past dating history just because you are married and it may head off any more drama.
