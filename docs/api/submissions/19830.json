It wasn't a great idea to goad him, but I'd barely call that goading.

Generally very nice, and a good brother and only mean to you when you started dating your gf, but then freaks out when he thinks she might be pregnant. And doesn't freak out at you, freaks out at her. Generally overprotective people attack the outside force that \"did\" that to their sister. \n\nThere might be some weird incestuous feelings there. Being mean only to you makes sense if you are the \"competition\", but being mean to her when there might be a sense of finality and lifelong commitment in the form of a child, is very concerning.\n\nI would not try to help fix the situation of her not going on that trip, it seems like a bad idea.", "NTA.

I see where all the NTAs are coming from because Allen is absolutely the major cause of these issues. But realistically OP knew what he was doing. He admits to it. What he should've done is said \"It's for someone else, please leave me alone\"\n\nBut instead he made a choice to upset this man he claims to feel threatened by, and his GF had to pay the consequences, which firmly puts him in asshole territory", "Fair enough.

This antiquated thinking that it's fine for a random male family member to get aggressive and possessive about a female relative who they fear is sexually active/pregnant and therefore want to control is awful.\n\nIf someone approaches you in a shop and demands to know why or what you're purchasing, \"don't worry about it\" is a perfectly reasonable response - no matter the tone. It is absolutely and precisely none of the brother's business what OP shops for (and he could easily be buying the test for a sibling, friend, mother, school project, science experiment...)\n\nIt doesn't matter if  OP was 'winding him up'. Being mildly provoked is not an excuse for escalating unreasonably. The brother is still appallingly out of line here. His sister's womb is none of his concern. And even if we could claim he was just worried or cares - there were a HUNDRED better ways to have approach this issue with his sister and OP than suspicion, accusation, and outright aggression.\n\nIt sounds like bruised vanity at best where a pregnant teen sister might 'make him look bad' sonehow, or blatant misogyny at worst.\n\nEither way, you unknowingly saved your GF from a trip alone with a controlling man who wants to police her body.\n\nNTA.", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d unfortunately the joke just wouldn't land here because pound is the currency, so Poundland is supposed to mean that everything in the shop costs one poun", ">First, you knew the guy was explosive and riled him up anyway.\n\nI've explained this so many times. He only hates on me, he is very nice to everyone else, especially his sister. \n\n>Second, the whole pregnancy test thing seems shady af. Exactly how were you planning on showing your cousin how the test worked. Were you going to pee on it? Then wait to see when it showed up negative? Yeah, I don\u2019t know. A 15 year old boy can figure that out without two males plying with a pregnancy test.\n\nI was obviously not going to pee on it wtf. I used water on it to make it give a negative result and then explained how that happened with all the science behind it which was necessary for him to know for his GCSE biology exam. I already explained that he is a visual learner and it's not exactly the easiest concept to understand for a GCSE student. Some people just benefit from having a real life model of something in their hands so they can actually visualise what's going on. I don't see why the both of us being male has anything to do with this.", "Sounds like he\u2019s mentally ill and has been able to control and manipulate his little sister all this time and now that she has a boyfriend he\u2019s threatened he\u2019s losing control over her. Also I\u2019m guessing the boyfriend doesn\u2019t know the full story. Seems the older brother has done a lot of damage to her psyche.", "Tbh if your gf doesn't cut him off after this for at least 6 months then you have a bigger problem with her than with him.\n\nShe needs to take the forefront. She needs to meet with her family and confront her brother. She needs to tell him directly to his face that he either apologizes sincerely to your face and never, ever pull this again OR he's cut off.\n\nAnd she needs to stick to it. Because the only way this gets better is if she points out her boundary and follows through.\n\nIf she doesn't follow through there's no point and it sends the opposite message that she's spineless and will never say \"no\" and stand by it, even if it hurts you.", "Jesus christ. He'll probably end up in jail before long and you won't have to worry about him.", "NTA! You could have been purchasing it for anyone. It's not any of his business what you do with it. I'm glad her parents are supportive of her decision not to go.", "NTA Reading your comments only adds to my concern. Who told you of the \"nice things\" he does for his sister? The parents? Your GF? You can never be sure what happens behind closed doors. Also, who goes on a weekend trip to Italy for a birthday? Graduation I can understand. And why aren't the parents going? So many red flags you can carpet the country. Do your best to get GF out of there is my advice, OP.", "NTA but I don't blame your girlfriend for not feeling safe around him.", "Dude Allen wants to be more than just your gf brother \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c I wouldn\u2019t feel safe if I was her either", "NTA - his negative assumptions and prejudgement of you led him to this reaction. You owe him nothing: he owes you an apology, and she has every right to fear him now. Actions have consequences.", "NYA, the parents need to parent that AH more, but you do owe your gf an apology for accidentally putting her through that, I know it wasn't intentional but she needs a big hug. So does he ofc, and frankly so do her parents for raising an AH who doesn't get basic boundaries. \n\nI don't think you did anything wrong but avoid conflict with this guy, it's not worth it if your gf is going to suffer, especially if she has MH problems already", ">... demanding that I apologise for 'misleading' him \n\nOh no. No way. \n\nYou may have 'tricked' him into showing his true colours, but this was all on him. He did not need to act all crazy towards his sister. \n\nI am happy she's not going with him", "Jeez. NTA. Allen is either mildly batshit unstable or is performing a caricature of a protective older brother. I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to do along with him. \nWhat he\u2019s basically done too is show her he wouldn\u2019t be empathetic & supportive if she did get pregnant. He\u2019s gross.", "Man this is like the 1000th comment saying this how am I supposed to tell my girlfriend that her brother might be into her \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2d", "Exactly. I don't think he purposefully mislead him at all really. Even if he intended to, saying, 'Don't worry about it', to a logical older brother from his girlfriend's brother, would imply, 'It's not for your sister' hence the 'don't worry' part.", "I definitely find it fishy he's ONLY psycho around OP. He allegedly has anger issues he's being treated for, so I highly doubt he's not rage-y about other people as well. It seems like someone has sugar-coated his issues to OP. \"Oh he's not like this with ANYBODY else!\" when he really, really is. \n\n(To be fair about the trip thing, I took my sister on a long weekend vacation for her 16th birthday. Not to another country, mind you, but we live in the US so our 8-hour car ride was still in the same country, lol.)"]}
