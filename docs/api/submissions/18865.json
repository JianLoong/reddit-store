If he won a tenner on a scratchcard would it go towards the household? If he genuinely would then I'd consider sharing your profits, or maybe put it aside and save up for a special treat for both of you.

Maybe add the total of your commission money, net of expenses, to your total income. Raise each of your allowances accordingly.

Your husband is demanding about 5 bucks a commission. He is making this an issue all over an extra $5 a few times a year. And that's if you get $50 and do the split 20%. And all the money goes back into the hobby, meaning you are not even asking him for more money. If this was a real job,  it would be different. But $5 is not enough to demand over a hobby.", "NTA. We have a similar thing in our household too. My DH is a musician. For him it\u2019s an independence thing. However to be fair it also means you taking less of your husbands pay.", "NTA. You could split it, but then the money he takes is just going to come out of the general fund anyways so it seems rather pointless. Maybe if you clue him in to how much it costs to art, he might be glad that you've got a bit if extra income to buy supplies... Plus, what's $25 bucks going to get him? Half a tank of gas?

Approximately $100 a year is nothing, and it\u2019s kind of controlling of him to want a part of it. As you said, it is just enough for new art supplies, which can get expensive.

Neither of these things are easy, but neither is you taking commissions. \n\nPlease sit down with him and figure out why he's so upset by this.

Split the rest.", "And where does your 'allowance' come from.\n\nIf you want to claim that you each keep the money you bring in, then your husband is sharing his money with you and he's paying for your supplies.\n\nIf income is shared...share the damn commission.", "I'm glad it works for you guys, it just doesn't make sense to me honestly. In my experience, fights and stress are avoided due to the fact that my wife and I are consistently willing to update and check with the other prior to making purchases that could disrupt budgeting.\n\nI can see why separate finances would be good if it annoyed one of the partners when the other spent money on something, I guess I just don't understand the base annoyance. If spending is too high in any area we just discuss it, and either figure out what the actual budget for that thing should be or make a compromise on how often it's done.", "I agree in terms of money. Inheritance should be separate for things such as family heirlooms, as they should go back to the family if you don't have someone to pass it down to in your line rather than having it go to the spouse's family.", "Do you really not have anything better to do with your time than argue about were half of $10 goes? That's fucking absurd and petty.", "Which is why I think they need to talk about why he wants this money. If he is stressed and unhappy being the breadwinner, they need to find a way to fix that. Having a SAHP is fantastic for the families that system works for (doesn't matter if its mom or dad) but it doesn't always work and people shouldn't make unilateral decisions about their family's future by just refusing to go to work. No matter how you slice it, they need a big talk about finances because arguing over this small amount is not the root problem.", "My mom went to work part time when my sister and I were in high school. And because there were money problems with a sole breadwinner. That lasted around a decade and my mom was a stay at home wife with no kids or grand kids or anything. That was the arrangement. She took care of the house stuff. She starter collecting social security before my dad.  And when they were both doing it they shared more expenses.", "They made a decision that her contribution to the household was child rearing and house household maintenance. She is making a few cents on her hobby. This isn\u2019t income. \n\nI had a SAHM mom. Really mom my was a stay at home wife basically the entire time. At some point she did work a bit, that money was hers. She paid for her hobbies and activities. And she chipped in to household expenses when her income was needed and significant. This $200 that most,y gets spent in art supplies isn\u2019t doing anything for their budget and gives her an outlet for dealing with the household stressors.", "He decided or did they decide? It doesn\u2019t say anywhere that this was a one sided decision", "So potentially bonuses could range anywhere from 500 to thousands of dollars. This person is bring in about $50 or so extra bucks a year. If they were bringing in that same amount then it would make sense to talk about splitting it. This dollar amount is just petty", "It\u2019s a choice both she and her husband made, but leaves only her vulnerable in the event of divorce. So yeah, I believe she deserves some kind of financial safety net. \n\nIn my prenup, there\u2019s a clause that guarantees me an alimony package if some day I end up sacrificing my career to stay home with kids. If you don\u2019t have a prenup protecting you, an emergency account only you have access to can offer protection instead.", "It\u2019s only a sacrifice because it isn\u2019t as transferable outside of the marriage. It\u2019s easier to get a new job if one ends than it is to enter a new marriage as a stay at home wife. It doesn\u2019t sound like this couple is one where he would have to or be able to support her fully in case of divorce.", "That is the definition of fair.", "Actually determine what OP is really spending/using before going on about profits.", "Lol, this guy is caps locked and asking why people are arguing about morality in /r/aita. Hilarious.", "Calm down with the caps chief. It's $10-$30 per month, and when they make so little money already, these small amounts matter.\n\nAnd if you don't like arguing, maybe reddit comments are not for you.", "If you\u2019re arguing that it\u2019s pointless for the husband to want to split such a small amount then you can also argue that it\u2019s pointless for the wife to not split such a small amount.", "What I\u2019m saying is their allowance - for fun things like art- is only 1/56 of his salary and 1/8 of hers. She can\u2019t afford to buy more art supplies without her art income! And he wants to take that away from her when he clearly has plenty of money", "Read the post.", "Wait, why does she get to top up her 'fun money'.\n\nShe spent that on her hobby.", "I mean you could pose that question towards yourself, this is a two way street pal. The whole point of this subreddit is mostly pointless arguments.\n\nOnly difference is you are using shit logic. The amount of money is irrelevant. It could be 50 cents, doesn't particularly matter as to whether or not OP is in the wrong. But if you want to focus on that particular element, OP has already said they are on a tight budget. Based on having a 50 dollar personal allowance each, it sounds like their situation is far from comfortable and likely every amount matters, even 10 dollars.", "And yet here we are.", "The tax man disagrees with regards to this being income.\n\nOP also says that money is tight in the house and that they had a deal regarding spending money being $50 each. Everything was worked out but then OP found she could get a bit extra and doesn\u2019t want to share.\n\nNow imagine husband coming home and saying \u201cI got a pay rise but I\u2019m not sharing it cus I don\u2019t want to..and it\u2019s only a small one anyways\u201d", "She\u2019s obviously not trying to save an extra 20$ four times a year for an emergency fund. And that wouldn\u2019t even cover her. And if they divorce, it\u2019s called getting a job. Just because she\u2019s a SAHM for years does not make her unhirable. Sure I\u2019m sure she can\u2019t get her dream career but if you need money and need to pay rent you can get your ass to a restaurant, an office, a warehouse, or any thing else. That\u2019s ridiculous to suggest the measley amount she makes yearly will protect her if they get divorced and she clearly doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s trying to save it anyways. She called it extra money to spend.", "You don\u2019t know that. Sure maybe she can\u2019t get a corporate job that takes a degree but there are PLENTY of good paying jobs out there for people who are entering back into the work force. It\u2019s a sacrifice she\u2019s willing to make and she\u2019s benefitting from, it\u2019s a privilege to be able to spend time with your children every day. Many working mothers wish they could be there with their kids everyday. It\u2019s still hard work to raise children but it\u2019s not like she is being forced to do this or didn\u2019t make that choice to have kids in the first place", "The point is she's supplements her art supplies quarterly, so the $50 is spent just buying several of the supplies. \n\nAnd if it's an issue he can find a hobby to make extra cash.", "I mean in a relationship why would you argue about something so petty? Obviously that's the whole point of this sub", "No its not she says she only sells 4 to 5 per year", "It's not though because she's self funding her hobby while her part time job money all goes to the house", "How does he have plenty of money? He has the same 50 dollars she has - because he is contributing much more to their finances than she is.", "Because the hobby is what paid back that money.  \n\nIt's the same reason nicer work clothes and gas money comes from the work expenses and not his fun money.  \n\nIf she doesn't sell any art then there's no money coming in, meaning she had to spend her fun money on it and doesn't get paid back.   If she sells, then it made those expenses money-making expenses and should be compensated.", "I understand that but if my SO is arguing about splitting 10 bucks then there are probably other issues at hand", "I mostly mean for them. Like things are real rough if your complain about not splitti.g 10 bucks", "It\u2019s part of what this sub is for, yes. If you don\u2019t like it or don\u2019t get it, you can mute subreddits. Let me know if you need a tutorial; I\u2019ll hook you up.", "My point still stands. It's extra money that should be split so both can benefit.", "Then why doesn\u2019t he pick up his own hobby?", "Some people have never been poor and it shows", "I think it's petty to argue about a few bucks", "He has a job that earns money of which he already contributes almost 100%.  \nAnyway, I didn't come here to argue who the asshole is. Just wanted to point out that you got your math wrong and he is indeed not contributing less than her."]}
