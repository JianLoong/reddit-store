If he won a tenner on a scratchcard would it go towards the household? If he genuinely would then I'd consider sharing your profits, or maybe put it aside and save up for a special treat for both of you.

Maybe add the total of your commission money, net of expenses, to your total income. Raise each of your allowances accordingly.

Your husband is demanding about 5 bucks a commission. He is making this an issue all over an extra $5 a few times a year. And that's if you get $50 and do the split 20%. And all the money goes back into the hobby, meaning you are not even asking him for more money. If this was a real job,  it would be different. But $5 is not enough to demand over a hobby.", "NTA. We have a similar thing in our household too. My DH is a musician. For him it\u2019s an independence thing. However to be fair it also means you taking less of your husbands pay.", "NTA. You could split it, but then the money he takes is just going to come out of the general fund anyways so it seems rather pointless. Maybe if you clue him in to how much it costs to art, he might be glad that you've got a bit if extra income to buy supplies... Plus, what's $25 bucks going to get him? Half a tank of gas?

This could be a yellow flag for me though for potential for financial abuse.

Lots of weird takes here and I spent way too much time thinking this over. This entire post is completely besides how much income either party makes except the art in question. It\u2019s also not to debate the merits or dollar value of stay at home motherhood and is simply taking their current allowance and ops art in to account. \n\nIf OP used some allowance to buy art supplies and then sold a commission for an average of $35 and then used that money to buy more art supplies for the next commission or practice or whatever to offset the cost of making art then it\u2019s a net neutral cost hobby and self sustaining. If she spent less on art supplies or didn\u2019t develop her skills then she may not be able to make the same on the next commission. \n\nOP has said she uses the money for art supplies so I assume that means she uses the revenue from selling the commission to purchase art supplies and not other things and with the current amount she is receiving from commissions has enough to buy art supplies again that in turn she sells a commission on to buy more art supplies. It doesn\u2019t appear to me that OP is making a profit, and is turning $35 in to something she sells for $35 and if she gets lucky enough to make $45 or something she\u2019s using that to buy supplies sell for she still has to replenish and buy art supplies to cover for when she makes $20. By reinvesting the $45 she just made, she may make more next time or may make $35 again or may make $20 and in the end it will presumably average out to $35. This is $0 profit per year most likely and from how OP has explained it, she\u2019s not using the money from commissions to go out to lunch or buy a Lamborghini or whatever, just exclusively to buy art supplies to sustain her hobby. \n\nHusband has asked that 50% of the revenue (not income or profit) from the commissions OR that 80% of the revenue (formerly 100%) goes to art supplies and then they split the remainder 50%. This makes the hobby no longer possible to self sustain. \n\nUnder these conditions OP selling a commission for $40 means either $20 to go to art supplies and $20 to go to the husband worst case, OR $32 goes to art supplies, husband gets $4 and OP gets $4 which presumably means $36 for art supplies best case.  Next time it may be $20 commission where husband makes $2-$10 and OP only has $10-$16 to spend on supplies.  If supplies to make the commission are the same as the average commission of $35 as well, then she\u2019s having to come up with the difference from her allowance so husband that month has $52-$60 and OP gets $25-$31 the month a commission is done.\n\nThis takes op from effectively $0 profit to a 10%-50% loss that she needs to recoup from her allowance unless she quickly changes her prices to be able to make a consistent profit from her income of the commission alone, not the overall revenue. \n\nThis effectively gives husband more allowance money and OP gets less, making the creation of the art less viable. Taking a net loss on painting overtime would mean that eventually it wouldn\u2019t be financially worthwhile or sustainable and possibly OP would no longer be able to afford to do it to a level with which they could make a commission bringing the loss to an overall 100% loss. It seems like it would be less draining to cut out the \u201cmiddle man\u201d of making the art and just jump straight to giving the husband $19-$25 every few months from OPs allowance since it has the same result in the end, or OP needs to raise her prices to the point where she\u2019s not operating at a loss. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a fair deal for you OP. Regardless of if you are or not, your husband would be making a profit from your work and for him to succeed from your efforts while you fail is wrong. \n\nThe only way it would be fair is if you split only the profits and that\u2019s only fair because a marriage is a partnership.", "Unpopular but NTA\u2026I think the amount of money you\u2019re making here is the key.

It's a hobby done in free time so it shouldn't be joint. It's a insurance payout, nothing to do with you, so it shouldn't be joint. I won big from a scratchcard that I purchased with my own money on my own time so it shouldn't be joint. If the couple agree to draw a line, then that's obviously between them, but when you impose your own line against the wishes of your partner after pooling all of your funds jointly...kind of makes you an asshole in my books.\n\nEqually by your logic, the husband would be fine dipping his free time into doing overtime at work and pooling all of that money to himself.

It could be twice as much as he makes, but it could also be that she expects him to clean, cook, run errands or help with the children - which is normal since they are married. We don't know hoe they run their household. But we do know how much money they both earn.\n\nThis is all besides the point anyway. Arguing about who earns more only matters if we believe that the person who earns more money should be entitled to more spending money.

She started teaching private art lessons to kids and made a very insignificant amount of money, but it was a source of comfort and independence. Being a SAHM can be isolating and a bit scary- to know your entire livelihood depends on your husband. Could my dad have technically raised an argument that she should give him 50% of her income even though it was nothing compared to his? Sure. But it's an inconsequential amount of money, she already had the full-time job of raising their children, and leaving it be meant that she was on slightly more equal ground.\n\nI think you're right!  I just wouldn't do what the husband did.

She even said there's only sometimes $5 or $10 leftover. So he's getting bent out of shape over $2.50 - $5 four or five times a year. That's maybe $10-$25 in an *entire year* that he's getting petty over.\n\nETA her commissions are actually only between 2-5 a year. So it could be as little as $5 \"profit\" in a year.

In other words, she thinks she deserves $1620/month, while her spouse deserves $1600/month.", "So she has an expensive hobby.\n\nWhy does that entitle her to not share her money like her husband does?", "Yes, they are low income, but he is still capable of supporting them.

She will also have a large gap in employment history which makes it far harder to get another job.", "L take", "If she can keep income separate from their joint account, why does he have to put all of his income in? How much money should he start keeping for himself? \n\nI agree that the amount is pedantic, but that does not mean you should just forget about it. If they have a system where ALL income is put into the joint account, then her art commissions need to be included in that. Just because the amounts are small doesn't mean she gets to keep the money away from her family.

Just because the treatment would be equal doesn't mean it's equitable. \n\nNot saying the hubbie here is abusive, but if he was standing next to a financially abusive man, trying to keep the wife from having any sort of income or funds he can't micromanage I couldn't tell them apart.\n\nHe could leave her tomorrow and get a new apartment next week when his paycheck comes, leaving her to drown. She doesn't have that financial independence and security because she gave it up for their family's benefit. She literally could not afford to leave unless he allows her some flexibility which is why some abusive men WOULD act like this.", "According to the OP, there is money."]}
