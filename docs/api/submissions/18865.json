Although actually, seeing your monthly allowance you both get from the joint account I could guess he's unhappy with you doubling your fun money 4-5 times a year?\n\nBecause it's not consistent or substantial income I don't see why you should split it (and if you only have the joint accounts/joint savings I'd be wary), but I do get why he'd see it as unfair if one month you have double the allowance he does as he's the biggest financial contributer to the household. If he won a tenner on a scratchcard would it go towards the household? If he genuinely would then I'd consider sharing your profits, or maybe put it aside and save up for a special treat for both of you. I think you two definitely need to talk about the structure of your finances again - if you have a joint account, you should each still have your own personal account.", "NTA.

If you were making $100every time, maybe.  If over the course of a year you make max $200 off this, and the majority of the money goes back into your supplies then I'm very confused by your husband's insistence he needs this money? If he wants extra money, he could also find a hobby that gets him a side hustle or pick up some extra shifts from work... when I was unemployed, I started using cash back apps to try to get a little spending money for myself. When I started working again at a significantly lowering paying job than he has, my husband still continued to do things to help me gain \"points\" (to get more cash back) and insists the money earned from those is mine. My paycheck though is split and put into our joint account. \n\nYour husband's insistence on getting the small sum you make without him on your hobby is very odd. You're getting $3.80 a week over the course of a year and he insists he needs a cut of it?", "YTA deffinatly.", "NTA/NAH. I disagree with others that the small amount is irrelevant. After cost of supplies are deducted I can't imagine there's enough leftover to get upset about. Why can't he spend $40 four times a year on himself? I don't understand that comment from him about \"extra money\" if he is the breadwinner. \n\nHowever, you are able to do this because he supports you, and you also aren't a child earning their first side money but part of a partnership. \n\nA conversation about readjusting your finances is in order. Maybe add the total of your commission money, net of expenses, to your total income. Raise each of your allowances accordingly. Or don't include it and let him have a bit extra cash in his personal budget. His reaction to a rather small amount of commission suggests to me that maybe he feels squeezed by that low amount.", "Soft ESH. If the amount of money is so small, why do either of you care what happens to it? Suggest you set the profits aside for a fun night out or toward a vacation, activities you\u2019d enjoy together.", "NTA. Why does he want to spoil the reward you get from this hobby?\n\nThe key issue, though, is that you should have a better and clearer agreement about finances in general.", "Nta - I'm shocked with everyone saying you need to share. Your husband is demanding about 5 bucks a commission. He is making this an issue all over an extra $5 a few times a year. And that's if you get $50 and do the split 20%. And all the money goes back into the hobby, meaning you are not even asking him for more money. If this was a real job,  it would be different. But $5 is not enough to demand over a hobby.", "NTA. We have a similar thing in our household too. My DH is a musician. For him it\u2019s an independence thing. However to be fair it also means you taking less of your husbands pay.", "NTA. You could split it, but then the money he takes is just going to come out of the general fund anyways so it seems rather pointless. Maybe if you clue him in to how much it costs to art, he might be glad that you've got a bit if extra income to buy supplies... Plus, what's $25 bucks going to get him? Half a tank of gas? Whoopee-doo.", "NTA After purchasing supplies there are probably only a few dollars left, why bother with that.\n\nTell your husband he is free to join you, then he can make money of this hobby too.", "It sounds like he just doesn't want you having anything of your own.", "NTA as long as your family isn\u2019t in a dire situation money wise. Approximately $100 a year is nothing, and it\u2019s kind of controlling of him to want a part of it. As you said, it is just enough for new art supplies, which can get expensive. It would be different if you were making $600 from commissions or something. Maybe you could come to an agreement with him, that if your income from art were to meet a certain threshold, than you would split it with him.", "Buy him a burger or something.", "ntah  it your money  there is no 50/50", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you are buying the supplies with your own fun money and making $200 or less a year from your hobby, I don't see why your husband is insisting that what essentially amounts to $3.80/ week (or less) needs to be split between you. That money might pay an electric bill once or twice a year if you saved every scrap of it but he isn't insisting it go into the joint account. He's insisting that it equally support both of your hobbies. There simply isn't enough of it to do that. He has the option of picking up extra shifts or finding a new hobby that would also work to make him money. Neither of these things are easy, but neither is you taking commissions. \n\nPlease sit down with him and figure out why he's so upset by this. If he is angry that you get a little extra spending money a few times a year (barely enough at a time for yall to have a meal out as a family!) Then there needs to be more discussion about why he can't be happy for you. If it makes him resentful that you aren't earning more money outside the home, there needs to be a discussion of how you can help him feel more supported.  This could be a yellow flag for me though for potential for financial abuse. If he's happy for you to stay mostly at home, but doesn't want you having money he doesn't personally give to you, that's a major issue that I don't think can be solved with conversation.", "YTA", "This. They need to sit down and look at cost of supplies vs. commission income. \n\nIf the art income doesn\u2019t cover the cost of supplies used for the commission: OP should keep the money. \n\nIf the art income exceeds the cost of supplies: they should split the difference. \n\n(Source: freelancer with multiple streams of income who has a husband that works a 9-5.)", "So if he gets a raise, is that extra income? If all the income he makes goes into the shared account, its not unreasonable that all the money she makes does the same.

Sure she could put that money ($2-10 maybe 4 times a year) in the bank account, but it's just going to come right back out to buy more art supplies.

If not, why should that be treated any different than income gained from a hobby?", "It should be negotiated at that point, yes. It may mean that he gets a little more fun money than she does. It might mean he would rather put it in a new savings account or retirement or what have you. He worked hard for the raise and he should feel like his work is meaningful.

She just uses her fun money to make money and he doesn't. She isn't making money hand over fist. If he was angry she wasn't saving that money to pay an extra bill or two, I could understand. $200/yr isn't a lot but it can definitely add up. However, he insists that they split it 50:50 for their fun money. She makes 3.80/week more than he gets in fun money and he insists she needs to split that even smaller? Why? If he's jealous, he can do the same thing. If he's resentful she stays home, he needs to be upfront about that instead of splitting beans. Or he's trying to financially abuse her by insisting on dividing an already tiny pot of money she controls without his input. None of these are a good look for him and paint him as happy or supportive.", "Only if her husband is vindictive and petty AF.

I don't see how that's unfair. You say he could do the same thing but again, he works outside of the home and I presume has responsibilities when he gets home. Also, if the situation were reversed and he was making extra income and not splitting it claiming that he made it and she didnt, youd call that financial abuse. It's not splitting beans when $50 is all you have as an allowance. That's a good percentage more in the already meager pot. I'd hardly call it financial abuse.
