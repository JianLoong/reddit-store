My mum is a really good cook and baker and it's a tradition that she asks us what cake we want on our birthday. I said I'm diabetic so please can I have one of those cheese boards that looks like a cake instead. She said 'people want something sweet '. So I suggested strawberries and whipped cream which I can eat.\n\nAt my party she pulls out sugary cupcakes.\n\nNormally I try to just suck it up and try not to be the annoying person that tries to make everyone else suffer for my diet. In fact I'd quietly just not eaten anything that wasn't suitable for the rest of the party and been really accepting of the fact that everyone else was getting drunk when I obviously can't. This was just too much for me though.\n\nSo when the cupcakes were served, I quietly went and sat in the other room. My husband came and found me and sat with me.\n\nMum is now upset and says it was embarrassing that they were going to sing happy birthday and I wasn't there. I know it was immature but I'm grumpy and pregnant and also I have a Christmas birthday so already have a few hang ups about my birthday getting lost. AITA?\n\nEdit: a few people are asking if the cheese platter or strawberries were on offer alongside the cupcakes and the answer is no. That would have been fine.
