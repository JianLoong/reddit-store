My mum is a really good cook and baker and it's a tradition that she asks us what cake we want on our birthday. I said I'm diabetic so please can I have one of those cheese boards that looks like a cake instead. She said 'people want something sweet '. So I suggested strawberries and whipped cream which I can eat.\n\nAt my party she pulls out sugary cupcakes.\n\nNormally I try to just suck it up and try not to be the annoying person that tries to make everyone else suffer for my diet. In fact I'd quietly just not eaten anything that wasn't suitable for the rest of the party and been really accepting of the fact that everyone else was getting drunk when I obviously can't. This was just too much for me though.\n\nSo when the cupcakes were served, I quietly went and sat in the other room. My husband came and found me and sat with me.\n\nMum is now upset and says it was embarrassing that they were going to sing happy birthday and I wasn't there. I know it was immature but I'm grumpy and pregnant and also I have a Christmas birthday so already have a few hang ups about my birthday getting lost.

You had every right to leave the room when she started serving cupcakes.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you mentioned the making-everyone-eat-your-diet thing, but since she specifically asked you what you wanted and then ignored your wishes (for your own birthday cake), I get why you\u2019re grumpy and it\u2019s clear that\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing here. You deserved to take a moment after feeling ignored and like your needs weren\u2019t met. \n\nHope you had a happy birthday other than that, OP!", "NTA and your husband sounds like a gem.", "NTA\n\nAsking what someone wants, just so you can reject what they say and make what you think they should have instead, is a total d\\*\\*k move.\n\nManipulation 101", "NTA.   \nYou told her why you would not eat the cupcakes. You asked her for something different and she chose to ignore it. You have diabetes. Youre pregnant and she expects you to be happy when she whips out something you clearly did not ask for?  \nIt's nice that she baked them of course and i get her point of \"something sweet for the guests\" but she could have made you a cheese board and then get the cupcakes later when you (the birthday child!!) were taken care of.\n\nIt was inconsiderate and your reaction may have been immature but you were upset.\n\nI think you should just talk to your mom, thank her for baking cupcakes but explain your issue. Im sure shell understand :)", "NTA, you acted calmly and your mum didn't take your dietary needs into consideration even after being discussed.", "NTA my wife had gestational diabetes with our kids and it can be a real pain on top of the pregnancy. Factor the other things in and yes leaving seems like an appropriate response!", "NTA. Doesn't sound like you stormed out. \n\nYou're pregnant.

Your mother is disrespectful and entitled. This was supposed to be your day, and she ruined it by going behind your back and doing something you specifically asked her not to do. Talk to her about it, but be firm. Don't end a statement by saying \"ok?\" because that's a negotiation. It's like asking \"Is it ok with you if I ask you to stop trying to give me sugary things during my pregnancy?\" Which is ridiculous. Tell her \"Stop doing that\" instead. Good luck, and congratulations in advance for your new baby.", "It sounds like you had a good reason for wanting to avoid the cupcakes and that you were trying to handle the situation maturely by quietly sitting in another room. It's understandable that you might be feeling grumpy and overwhelmed, especially given your pregnancy and the challenges of having gestational diabetes.\n\nIt's also understandable that your mother is upset. However, it's important to remember that you have the right to advocate for your own health and well-being, especially when it comes to managing your gestational diabetes.\n\nOverall, it seems like the situation could have been handled better by all parties involved. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your mother about how you feel and how you would prefer to celebrate your birthday in the future. This can help to clear the air and prevent similar misunderstandings from happening again. So, NTA", "NTA\n\nYour birthday is a celebration about you, not your mother or the other guests. Your mother deliberately insulted you with the cupcakes. \n\nAnd instead of making a scene when she tried to sing happy birthday to you with something that is dangerous to both you and your child, she finally noticed that you had calmly walked into another room. \n\nIt would have been more embarrassing for your mother when people started asking why you weren\u2019t eating the cupcake after blowing out the candle. I don\u2019t think loved ones would be pleased to hear that your mother deliberately brought and served something that you couldn\u2019t eat instead of bringing what you had requested (and that everyone could have enjoyed).", "NTA. There are a million healthy fun options. She should have had the cake you requested, and if she wanted to add sugary cupcakes as an extra for the guests, great. But she didn't get to sabotage your birthday and that's what she did. No blame from me for being hurt and taking yourself out of the situation rather than yelling at her in public about how you're diabetic, you discussed this with her, and she now has you pregnant and hungry with very little around you can eat AND your \"birthday cake\" is poisonous to you. Which a full-on rant would not have gotten a YTA from me, so quietly leaving? You're a nicer person than I would have been in this situation!", "NTA.

You're not TA if you don't pretend to like something you can't have after being asked *for your own celebration*.", "INFO: was there something there for you to eat as well, or just the cupcakes? \n\nIf it was just cupcakes, NTA. That\u2019s so beyond rude. \n\nIf you also had something to eat, NAH. It really sucks to be limited, but if people are accommodating you, they are still allowed to have things they like. You didn\u2019t handle it rudely or blow up, you just left. That\u2019s a reasonable response to feeling left out at *your* party on *your* birthday.", "NTA - your mom was an inconsiderate AH more interested in her presentation than her own pregnant daughter.  She deserved that embarrassment and more.", "I would also take Mom to the next OB appointment and have the doc tell her everything that might go wrong with her new grandbaby if you don't follow your diet.", "NTA your mom knows that you had dietary needs and ignored them.

I have diabetic family members. Any time we\u2019ve made or bought desserts or treats for them, they\u2019ve always been sugar free. There\u2019s plenty of delicious sugar free options.

Mine is in early January and I was constantly given \u201cjoint\u201d presents, or excuses that I couldn\u2019t have a party because it was too close to the holidays. I always get a bit hypersensitive around my birthday and I can only imagine how this can be magnified with pregnancy and gestational diabetes.  You made a request for the kind of dessert you\u2019d like, and not only was it ignored, but there was no alternative for you.  Nothing says \u201cI want to celebrate my daughter\u201d like serving her something she can\u2019t eat!  \n\nYou didn\u2019t blow up at her - you found a quiet spot to sit with your feelings.  Good for you.", "Nta- you handled that so beautifully!!!", "NTA, and if something sweet was that necessary they could've done the cheese board for you and had stealthy cupcakes to the side. Also, as someone with a christmas adjacent birthday who never felt like they missed out from it, your parents failed in that regard too.", "NTA.

One of those things where yes, you can safely manage it and you and your baby will hopefully be even better than fine, but it\u2019s just a huge disruptive pain in the ass!

Your mom only takes requests so she can show off her baking skills and look impressive. Asking for cheese and fruit doesn't let her show off. Your mom is definitely the asshole.", "YTA. Softly saying YTA because you commented there was other food you could have eaten. You chose to sulk and pout because you have a diet restriction.
