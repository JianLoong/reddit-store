Bought a 2009 mustang.  Drove great nothing seemed wrong ither than what they told me about.  First day I had it, the thermostat housing cracked and sprayed all my coolant in a couple seconds leading to a blown gasket.  Eventually trying to figure out what happened the engine seized.  Total engine swap within 24 hours of purchase.  Tbh I don't blame the seller, it cracked on the backside and there was really no way to tell it was weakening because it didnt leak till it broke. Or at least I didn't see any leaks. Just an unfortunate situation.\n\nThe worst part was it being the thermostat that broke meant it never threw an over heating warning till I saw smoke.", "NTA.

It doesn't even matter to me if she didn't inspect it, she purchased the car and drove off.
