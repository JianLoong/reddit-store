ESH in general because neither of you seem to be listening to the other. Your wife is an adult woman, if she wants to move back to her hometown it\u2019s because it\u2019s what she wants, not because he parents are manipulating her.

And the North side of Chicago is really fucking nice and much better than anywhere in St. Louis. And I don't blame the wife for not wanting to live there... I mean a Missouri senator is literally arguing to legalize marriage for 12 year olds. I wouldn't want to raise my child there, either. Not saying Chicago or Illinois is perfect, but some of their new laws as of late can be dangerous for a woman in Missouri, especially if they want more kids. I'm not saying either of those are her reasons, but if they were, she should've communicated it.\n\nThe real problem is that neither of them are really communicating or having a conversation about it with each other.
