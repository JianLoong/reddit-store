He will literally pretend to be humble and downplay his family\u2019s wealth just to seem relatable I guess. \n\nThe others have been warming up to him but I\u2019m honestly not buying his rather fake personality. \n\nThe other day I was sitting at the canteen with another coworker and he asked if he could join us. I didn\u2019t want that but my coworker immediately said yes. \n\nWell he was asking me lots of personal questions and about my journey to the company. I told him that the interview process was hard and mentally draining. He nodded and said that it\u2019s tough getting into the place but that his interviews were \u201cfine\u201d. Even laughing and saying he came late to one because of a hungover. \n\nThis made me mad and I said \u201cgood for you\u201d. He thanked me and said that things always work out when you just \u201cchill out\u201d and stop taking things so seriously. This is when I said that we both know he\u2019s not nearly as competent as he believes and that he only got the job bc his uncle is literally the CEO. \n\nMy friend/coworker gasped and looked at me like I\u2019m crazy. The nephew shrugged and said that I don\u2019t seem to like him. I told him that this wasn\u2019t a personal matter so likes and dislikes are irrelevant. \n\nWe didn\u2019t argue but he got a little heated. And asking me what I want him to do. Then he said that I may view him as an over privileged asshole but I\u2019m more or less the same (which makes no sense). \n\nSo I fully expected him to report me to HR but to my surprise he never did. In fact he started following me on my social media accounts and messaging me at work more frequently. \n\nMy coworker has relayed this incident to the other girls and the consensus is that I\u2019m a major asshole. They said that not only was I unnecessarily hostile and rude, they\u2019re also mad he started hanging out with them less.

Both of you are acting like jerks in different ways.\n\nFrom a career perspective, you were definitely the AH here. Regardless of whether or not he goes to HR, your rude remarks can backfire on you. If he truly does have sway with his uncle the CEO, then all he has to do is casually mention that you said that stuff. Managers who give him extra credit for his familial ties to the CEO will listen and believe him.

He thanked me and said that things always work out when you just \u201cchill out\u201d and stop taking things so seriously. This is when I said that we both know he\u2019s not nearly as competent as he believes and that he only got the job bc his uncle is literally the CEO. \n\nMy friend/coworker gasped and looked at me like I\u2019m crazy. The nephew shrugged and said that I don\u2019t seem to like him. I told him that this wasn\u2019t a personal matter so likes and dislikes are irrelevant. \n\nWe didn\u2019t argue but he got a little heated. And asking me what I want him to do. Then he said that I may view him as an over privileged asshole but I\u2019m more or less the same (which makes no sense). \n\nSo I fully expected him to report me to HR but to my surprise he never did. In fact he started following me on my social media accounts and messaging me at work more frequently. \n\nMy coworker has relayed this incident to the other girls and the consensus is that I\u2019m a major asshole. They said that not only was I unnecessarily hostile and rude, they\u2019re also mad he started hanging out with them less.

Your bitterness is only going to hold you back. The nephew of the CEO of your company is trying to cozy up to you and in your jealous bitterness you reject him rudely. You don\u2019t know where networking with him and being kind will take you. It\u2019s not fair for you to judge/dislike him bc he\u2019s privileged just like it\u2019s not fair for him to treat you that way because you aren\u2019t.", "YTA. The dude is genuinely trying.", "YTA - Your jealousy is showing. Get therapy. You think you\u2019re better just because you were poor or less privileged. Some people are born into wealth, some aren\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean you can act like a dick because you worked harder.", "YTA - he seems like a decent person.  His comment about the interview being a breeze obviously rings hollow.  But certainly not worth you going after him with both barrels.\n\nYou\u2019re attitude is a much bigger problem than his privilege.\n\nPlus he\u2019s gonna be your boss at some point, so what you said was not only mean, but incredibly stupid.", "YTA. You seem to have a chip on your shoulder, however justified it may be. However, you've pigeonholed this person into a cage that you seem unwilling to have a broader horizon on.\n\nPeople are products of their environments, but individuals are also complex and multidimensional personalities. The time to call your colleague on their privilege in such a direct way is when they use it to put others down, such as saying that \"he's a better worker than you\", not when they are just being flippant about their own experiences in the company.\n\nI think it would also be pertinent for you to also acknowledge your own privilege as well, because you were able to access a workplace program that gave disadvantaged people a chance at employment, a privilege that is not available to sooooo many people who have tried and continue to try just as hard as you have, so imagine the office politics of you getting a job through that program but someone of similar status to you having to get that job without the program!? They would likely feel as resentful to you and you might to the CEO's nephew.\n\nI think you should find ways to communicate your experiences and acknowledge the privileged experiences of others without being resentful.\n\nFor example, when the nephew talked about how you just have to \"chill out\", you could communicate in a kind and empathetic matter than he can have that opinion because he has family members in the organization, which creates a layer of impunity compared to his peers that were hired with no networking or familial connections within the organization.", "YTA. You overstepped, not because he\u2019s the CEO\u2019s nephew but because it\u2019s unprofessional of you to assume he\u2019s unqualified for his position.

Also, if his uncle was such a stupid jerk who is blind to his own nephew\u2019s shortcomings, why even bother to create a program for disadvantaged youths?

You say nothing about his job performance and make all kinds of assumptions about his character that seem to be based on nothing other than a big, giant chip on your shoulder. Sure, there may well have been some nepotism involved in him getting the job. But for all you know, his uncle may have made him jump through some hoops, too.

First of all you should be proud of yourself, sounds like you did well to get this role, but it will not serve you in your career to have a chip on your shoulder as far as judging how easy or hard it was for someone to achieve the same thing. \n\nOn one hand, in the real world, nothing is fair. Some people have advantages and others do not.

Take your cue from them: make nice and apologize to him. Y'all don't have to be friends, but learning to get along with people you don't like is an important skill, and it sounds like you need to work on it.\n\nHowever, anyone acting like he's completely innocent after he bragged about showing up to an interview late and hungover and then told her to \"chill out\" because things just \"work out\" is bonkers.

Sounds like he was genuinely trying to be a good coworker and employee. You never provided any examples of his \u201cfake\u201d behavior which tells me it\u2019s all an assumption based on your resentment towards people who have it easier than you in certain areas. Everyone has struggles in life, it might have been easy for him to get a job, but you don\u2019t know what you have that he lacks.
