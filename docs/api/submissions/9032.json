He will literally pretend to be humble and downplay his family\u2019s wealth just to seem relatable I guess. \n\nThe others have been warming up to him but I\u2019m honestly not buying his rather fake personality. \n\nThe other day I was sitting at the canteen with another coworker and he asked if he could join us. I didn\u2019t want that but my coworker immediately said yes. \n\nWell he was asking me lots of personal questions and about my journey to the company. I told him that the interview process was hard and mentally draining. He nodded and said that it\u2019s tough getting into the place but that his interviews were \u201cfine\u201d. Even laughing and saying he came late to one because of a hungover. \n\nThis made me mad and I said \u201cgood for you\u201d. He thanked me and said that things always work out when you just \u201cchill out\u201d and stop taking things so seriously. This is when I said that we both know he\u2019s not nearly as competent as he believes and that he only got the job bc his uncle is literally the CEO. \n\nMy friend/coworker gasped and looked at me like I\u2019m crazy. The nephew shrugged and said that I don\u2019t seem to like him. I told him that this wasn\u2019t a personal matter so likes and dislikes are irrelevant. \n\nWe didn\u2019t argue but he got a little heated. And asking me what I want him to do. Then he said that I may view him as an over privileged asshole but I\u2019m more or less the same (which makes no sense). \n\nSo I fully expected him to report me to HR but to my surprise he never did. In fact he started following me on my social media accounts and messaging me at work more frequently. \n\nMy coworker has relayed this incident to the other girls and the consensus is that I\u2019m a major asshole. They said that not only was I unnecessarily hostile and rude, they\u2019re also mad he started hanging out with them less.

He is making the best of what he is given. So are you. The starting positions might not be the same but to say what you said in the situation you described was not really appropriate behavior.

Both of you are acting like jerks in different ways.\n\nFrom a career perspective, you were definitely the AH here. Regardless of whether or not he goes to HR, your rude remarks can backfire on you. If he truly does have sway with his uncle the CEO, then all he has to do is casually mention that you said that stuff. Managers who give him extra credit for his familial ties to the CEO will listen and believe him.

I told him that the interview process was hard and mentally draining. He nodded and said that it\u2019s tough getting into the place but that his interviews were \u201cfine\u201d. Even laughing and saying he came late to one because of a hungover. \n\nThis made me mad and I said \u201cgood for you\u201d. He thanked me and said that things always work out when you just \u201cchill out\u201d and stop taking things so seriously. This is when I said that we both know he\u2019s not nearly as competent as he believes and that he only got the job bc his uncle is literally the CEO. \n\nMy friend/coworker gasped and looked at me like I\u2019m crazy. The nephew shrugged and said that I don\u2019t seem to like him. I told him that this wasn\u2019t a personal matter so likes and dislikes are irrelevant. \n\nWe didn\u2019t argue but he got a little heated. And asking me what I want him to do. Then he said that I may view him as an over privileged asshole but I\u2019m more or less the same (which makes no sense). \n\nSo I fully expected him to report me to HR but to my surprise he never did. In fact he started following me on my social media accounts and messaging me at work more frequently. \n\nMy coworker has relayed this incident to the other girls and the consensus is that I\u2019m a major asshole. They said that not only was I unnecessarily hostile and rude, they\u2019re also mad he started hanging out with them less. (Not sure if this is a coincidence but I\u2019ve also been spending less time with them) \n\nAITA for giving my unprompted opinions?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You don\u2019t know where networking with him and being kind will take you. It\u2019s not fair for you to judge/dislike him bc he\u2019s privileged just like it\u2019s not fair for him to treat you that way because you aren\u2019t.", "YTA. The dude is genuinely trying.", "YTA - Your jealousy is showing. Get therapy. You think you\u2019re better just because you were poor or less privileged.

His comment about the interview being a breeze obviously rings hollow.  But certainly not worth you going after him with both barrels.\n\nYou\u2019re attitude is a much bigger problem than his privilege.\n\nPlus he\u2019s gonna be your boss at some point, so what you said was not only mean, but incredibly stupid.", "YTA. You seem to have a chip on your shoulder, however justified it may be. However, you've pigeonholed this person into a cage that you seem unwilling to have a broader horizon on.\n\nPeople are products of their environments, but individuals are also complex and multidimensional personalities. The time to call your colleague on their privilege in such a direct way is when they use it to put others down, such as saying that \"he's a better worker than you\", not when they are just being flippant about their own experiences in the company.\n\nI think it would also be pertinent for you to also acknowledge your own privilege as well, because you were able to access a workplace program that gave disadvantaged people a chance at employment, a privilege that is not available to sooooo many people who have tried and continue to try just as hard as you have, so imagine the office politics of you getting a job through that program but someone of similar status to you having to get that job without the program!? They would likely feel as resentful to you and you might to the CEO's nephew.\n\nI think you should find ways to communicate your experiences and acknowledge the privileged experiences of others without being resentful.\n\nFor example, when the nephew talked about how you just have to \"chill out\", you could communicate in a kind and empathetic matter than he can have that opinion because he has family members in the organization, which creates a layer of impunity compared to his peers that were hired with no networking or familial connections within the organization.", "YTA.

You say nothing about his job performance and make all kinds of assumptions about his character that seem to be based on nothing other than a big, giant chip on your shoulder.

They just show up for work.\n\nIn my department, we had someone apply. They were the son of someone higher up in the company. Their response to them getting hired was that I'm not part of it. Their thought process was that if they qualified great, if not, so be it. A previous job, the own sons, were joining the company. It was a given if they could hack it. They would end up in upper management. They put them on the line and made them work their way up from the bottom. Took them years to slowly move up.

With him trying to fit in and play nice with others.", "I'm in my early-mid 30's and it's funny reading this because this was exactly how I used feel and act when I was in my early to mid-20s too. It took me till I was in my late 20's to finally grow out of that mentality, and I have no idea how many friends it cost me in the process.\n\nContrary to the general opinion here, I don't actually think you're a bad person for it though, immature 100% yes, but not like in a condescending way, but in a you're just in your early 20's, you've barely scratched the surface at understanding the real world and being an adult, kind of way.\n\nI also didn't come up from much, and I worked hard for all the things that I got. I used to get so filled with hate, and frustrated whenever I would talk to people in my college classes and find out their parents were paying for their tuition, while I had to take out student loans, and pay for their apartment (while I had to pay for mine with a part time job), and they had a credit card and a meal plan to eat out for every meal (while I had to take what was left from my part time job and use it to buy whatever food I could get). It was absolutely infuriating, and then listening to these people complain about their problems and thinking less of them because they were so privileged and didn't even realize it, like how could you possibly complain about anything when your entire life is being paid for? It was absolutely fucking radioactive septic treatment plant toxic thinking.\n\nThat kind of thinking will absolutely poison your soul, not just your mind, but your soul because that type of thinking makes you BITTER and as you can tell from your experience, nobody likes bitter people, nobody wants to hang out with bitter people. The key is to STOP COMPARING YOURSELF TO OTHERS. It does nothing to help you and will only make you bitter.  People come from different backgrounds, and some will have it better than you, and there will also be some that have it worse than you. We all have our own baselines for what we expect out of life, and we also all have our own problems too, and our backgrounds don't necessarily get to determine whose problems are more or less legit.\n\nYou could say that nephew doesn't have any real problems or any real struggles because he didn't go through what you had to go through in order to get there, but are there certain ways that you took advantage of opportunities that were given to you that weren't also given to everyone else? We like to think about how \"I never had any help growing up, I did everything myself\" but realistically that's impossible! Unless you were a feral child who raised themselves and taught themselves everything they know, while housing, feeding, clothing, it's likely you got some help along the way. We all experience privilege in some way, some definitely more than others but it doesn't make our problems more or less valid.\n\nAgain, STOP COMPARING YOURSELF TO OTHERS, that's the only way you can break this cycle, and the only way you will find true happiness with yourself. You need to realize that you are always going to have it worse than somebody else, and likewise, somebody else is always going to have it worse than you. Focus on your own work.\n\nI actually somewhat applaud that young man for at least trying to make a connection with you and your friends, but you let that poisonous attitude get in your head and taint your image of him and became hostile. Stop it. Judge a person by their actions, not by their background. Ask yourself if this guy wasn't the nephew of the CEO would you actually enjoy talking with him? If not, then don't, but take his background completely out of the equation, hell you can even make the opposite work. BEFRIEND these people and a lot of times they can help you reach your goals because they have more access to things and people than you do on your own. I have several friends that I've gotten jobs, and vice versa.\n\nAnyway, this is turning into a book, but take some of it to heart, and stop letting yourself live in this toxic little bubble.\n\nTl;DR :  stop comparing yourself to other people and stop judging people based on their backgrounds instead of their actions. Focus on yourself, and it would behoove you to learn how to network, because sometimes befriending people with those kinds of good connections can sometimes further your own career.", "No, it doesn't.

(I'm kinda hedging a bet both ways, I really don't feel the episode is a big deal)", "hm. i do think YTA, but i want to help you move past this a considering that you still have to work with him. first off, in the future avoid confronting someone in a public way and with such clear resentment. you are a professional. take him aside, write him an email, do anything but insult him in front of your coworkers. deal with your anger before you confront him so that you can have a meaningful conversation. as for your current situation, i would evaluate how you want to move forward. more than likely it would be good to take him aside, apologize for your rudeness, and talk through some misconceptions on both sides. if you have to consider yourself the bigger person to do this then fine, just start a respectful dialogue and move past this.", "YTA.\n\nHe's being humble, and you're acting jealous. You're lucky he didn't report it to HR because what you said was plain nasty and uncalled for.", "YTA.\n\nThe CEO's nephew might have privilege, but he's trying to fit in and not pushing his status on anyone. Meanwhile, you got a slot because someone felt sorry for you and threw you a bone, not solely due to your competence.\n\nHe can't help that he came from his family any more than you can help that you came from yours. So why is only one of these things a negative in your eyes?  He didn't treat you negatively and I bet if people wanted to be critical, they could find your work lacking as well.", "So, what I\u2019m hearing is; the \u201cidiot\u201d nepotism hire caught on to your shitty attitude and, at a later time, easily baited you into speaking your mind by playing up the lazy underachiever attitude. YTA", "But number is bs. You can control whether the CEO of the company you work at is your uncle or not ;)", "Hallmark would love this shit", "She\u2019s romanticising his responses. It would never once cross her small brain that he\u2019s giving her the opportunity to apologise.", "Scheme is commonly used in international English instead of program(me). It doesn't have the nefarious connotation there that it does in the US. Google \"UK\", \"scheme\", and any group you can think of, like doctor, nurse, student, teacher, etc., for official examples.", "Lemme guess, you\u2019re in America? OP is likely in the UK, and a scheme is a large scale plan or system. Even over here a scheme isn\u2019t always a bad thing. Ever heard of a color scheme, or a diagram?", "The OP is from a country outside the USA. In British English, a scheme is a system, like pension scheme. A canteen is a work cafeteria. Same words are used in India English as well, so the OP is from one of these regions that use these words that we have different meanings for in the USA.", "I'm assuming OP is British. They use the word \"scheme\" over there like we use \"program\"", "Wonder if OP is in the UK - they're commonly called \"Grad Schemes\" here.", "Right? This totally reads like the kind of story an old couple tell their grandkids of how they met \ud83e\udd23", "Acting humble is different to actually being humble. Coming from a place of privilege doesn't mean he needs to act like he needs to be ashamed of it - which he doesn't -, but it also doesn't mean he gets to act like he has no privilege at all and that he is treated the same as the other employees. He isn't. The fact he showed up late AND hungover to the interview already shows how irresponsible he is, and frankly, I doubt if someone not related to the CEO had done they same they would've been hired. \n\nNot to mention that OP was the only person willing to point it out - which could come back to bite her in the ass eventually, so totally TA for that alone -, when everyone else was being nice to him. Who's to say people actually like him, or are just treating him well because they think being friends with the CEO's nephew could be beneficial to them, and really think he's an idiot? Seems like that might be the case, since he's been making an extra effort to be around OP after this situation and not spending as much time around OP's ass-kissing friends.", "I thought of this when she writes\n\n>The nephew of the CEO started his role at our department a little later and for whatever reason has been joining us girls for lunches etc. He tries VERY HARD to fit in and acts like he doesn\u2019t come from a place of insane privilege. He will literally pretend to be humble and downplay his family\u2019s wealth just to seem relatable I guess.  \nThe others have been warming up to him but I\u2019m honestly not buying his rather fake personality.\n\nI mean would she only not criticize him if he constantly bragged about his wealth and privilege?  \n\nShe got through the interviews, but if this is how she interacts with colleagues it is going to be a short honeymoon.", "As a public servant, I've worked with people who are \"second generation\" - their parent was or had been a senior official. Zero privilege - they had to get the job through the same interview process as everyone else because guess what? Senior managers don't make the hiring decisions; a rigorous HR process does. Who knows what happened here?\n\nETA: Some of the \"second generation\" folks had to apply more than once to get in.", "I am convinced the guy who became my boss had it in for me because he didn't like what my bumper sticker said.", "Yeah 100%. The wealth disparities between cousins on one side of the family and the other can be immense. \nSure there's nepotism involved and the nephew is naive about that. But it's also silly to think he grew up immensely privileged because of his uncles current position.", "Murdered by pirates is good...", "A guarantee you how he said it was not \u201cyou\u201d as in directed at OP but \u201cyou\u201d is an generalities. Like \u201cthings usually work themselves out\u201d but OP was looking for a reason to lash out at him", "It was even more then just looking at the application instead of just tossing it. OP went through a program that was going to have some of those people get hired. Is it the same as the nephew 100% not. But if you ask a person who had to go through the normal process they very likely see them as close to the same thing.", "I can't tell if you're missing the point intentionally, regardless nepotism is a value of wealth that is in a family.", "We don't know whether the conversation truly went in that direction. She dislikes this person too much for me to take this at face value.", "People down voting here have no idea how placing of people on special programs can work. Or the converse. \nLike I've been told \"we'd love to hire you but we have to hire a POC\".", "> \"You don't think being the CEO's nephew might have had something to do with that?\"\n\nThere is no universe where you can say that, or any of your other passive-aggressive comments, without coming off as bitter.", ">You don't think being the CEO's nephew might have had something to do with that?\" \n\nThere's nothing neutral or non bitter about that.", "I don't know how OP is able to make it out the door each morning with that massive chip on her shoulder weighing her down.\n\nShe may have gone through a difficult process to get the job, suggesting she is well qualified, but the way she is acting at work indicates she doesn't have a very high EQ.\n\nShe needs to get over the fact that not everyone comes from her background and learn to get along \n with everyone - especially someone closely related to the CEO.", ">People dont need to self flagellate and grovel or apologise to you just because they haven't had your struggle. \n\n>He may owe some tact.(Although it sounds like he's making a solid effort not to be a rich connected asshole) \n\n>But he doesn't owe people humility.\n\nI agree with this and I think the people here turning on the guy us typical reddit. \ud83d\ude44 everyone must be perfect", "Let's be real, she isn't there because of her skills alone, but because of a program. She, in a twisted way, got an advantage by being disadvantaged. Would she have gotten an interview without that program, just based on her skills alone?", "People typically err on the side of being less than charitable in their depiction of their adversaries in these posts. We\u2019re not bending over backward, because besides clearly not liking this dude, OP doesn\u2019t even describe him as doing anything wrong.", "Meh. Agree to disagree. There were some real zingers up there in that perspective of yours.", "So much dodgy logic being thrown around", "That\u2019s a really good point. Like, I have well-off family members who would absolutely help their siblings, niblings, and cousins with networking and jump-starting their career. But those same people 100% did not pay anyone else\u2019s bills or send anyone else\u2019s kids to college. \n\nThe guy\u2019s only privilege might be his uncle. \n\nAlso, just saying, but not all nepotism is an automatic free ride. I had a family member who fired more than one of his kids for failing to meet his standards\u2014when they were still in junior high.", ">I'm willing to be that was an exaggeration or an outright fib - he was probably trying to seem 'relatable' and 'down to earth'.\n\nI agree with this but it didn't matter what he said ,op was going to find something offensive or inflammatory about it.", "Actually yes she does. Dude asks her questions about her experiences, specifically her experience interviewing. \\*\\* She relates it. He then relates his which includes showing up to an interview late and drunk. He then tells her to \"chill out\" and it will \"all work out.\" That's pretty obnoxious. He negates her experience and presumes that he as someone who showed up hungover to an interview is in a position to give her advice when she is the one who managed to go through an extremely difficult interview process. I wouldn't react well to it either. I wouldn't have lost my shit, but I probably would have at least arched an eyebrow at it.\n\nIf you ask about someone's experience and they share it with you, it's an asshole move to say \"Oh that wasn't my experience and relax and manifest job acceptance.\" instead you should, you know, actually listen and take in what they are saying. He could have actually learned something if he did that.\n\n\\*\\*Personally I would have given him a non committal answer.
