It's not that I avoid them, I just don't ever reach out to them and only pick up calls every few months. I'll explain why.\n\nIt all started when I realized I was the black sheep in my family and it's never going to change and they're never going accept who I am. I'm not special or different, I'm just a white washed kid who grew up in a very Asian gangster household. They wear all high end clothing, drive expensive cars. I'm a skater/outdoors kid, I spent all my time outdoors, they did not understand it.\n\nAt 19, after been bullied, failed attempts at being manipulation - constantly being told I'm a crack head(I don't drink alcohol, didn't smoke weed until I was 22) because I skated; I packed my things up and moved out with out saying anything. My mom was hesitant at first and demanded I come home, this is where the NC started, I've been telling her for the last 8 years, if she's going to call it's not to tell me how to live me life. And after all that time of me hanging up the phone, anytime she starts going on about my life, she still doesn't get it and just calls back a few weeks later.\n\nI've been fully self sufficient since grade 10, they were consistently out of town for work(later I found one of them was just always on vacation and the other one was living in Asian with his wife - also did not he got remarried) After I left, my plan has always been, take nothing, owe nothing. I justified it because growing up, they favored my sibling and gave her everything! I'm talking LV, gucci, D&G etc when she was in grade 10, brand new Iphone when it came out and a new BMW when she turned 17 and got her license. I had to pay for everything with my lunch money and none of them even showed up to my ceremony. I later found out my parents left us $30k for the 6 months they were gone and my sister took it for her bills. They've paid for all her bills because she stayed at home and didn't move out until she was 27.\n\nAnyways, after all that, I haven't taken a single dime from them since I left 10 years ago. I have a ton of very close friends - I call them my chosen family. I still continue to do everything I do - I travel almost every weekend. My parents hate it all - they don't like me having \"white\" friends and they don't like me traveling because I need to work harder.\n\nFor reference, my sister makes $70k max while I do about $120k, I have great life long friends - my chosen family. And I'm happy that they're not really in my life anymore.\n\nThis has been burdening my mind for the last while, and I really want to believe it's fair that I feel this way. I'm just wondering why they think they're going to get away with it know what they have provided for me vs my sister.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to take care of them when they're old?", "created_utc": 1681413434, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12l06y2/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_im_not_taking/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let sister do it. You might want to change your phone number.", "NTA - it's completely fair how you feel.\n\nChildren don't owe their parents anything.      \n      \nThey certainly don't when those parents have been bad parents.", "NTA. Why would you? They haven\u2019t done their part as parents, so you have no obligations towards them. Also, if they are so flush with money, they have the means to make necessary arrangements for their old age.", "NTA, children don\u2019t owe their parents for being born, I\u2019d say the same if they were good parents to you. But if they\u2019re expecting to be taken care of , obviously the responsibility falls on your sister. You have a great family now, the only \ud83e\udd0f reason I\u2019d say you\u2019re TA is to yourself for not blocking them years ago", "NTA- culturally I am sure it feels like an obligation as the son. But culturally, they were supposed to treat you like a son for at least a little while. So no need to worry about it", "NTA I'm not sure why you take their calls just for them to criticise you. It takes a toll on you.", "Absolutely NTA.  And it's actually good to let them know in no uncertain terms sooner rather than later, so they can plan their lives accordingly.", "NTA.  Tell them their daughter will take care of them. Or they can use all the money they saved on not buying you a car, college, or anything really.", "NTA\n\nThey will reap from you what they sowed.\n\nAnd I suspect from your sister, they won't reap anything at all. \n\nLive your life well and don't let any misplaced guilt wiggle it's way in.", "NTA\n\nWestern perspective: children don't owe parents; parents are required to raise their children. They failed this.\n\nEven if you are considering filial piety, filial piety is based on returning love and care back to the caregiver when they need that help. They are going to get back exactly what they provided to you: nothing.", "NTA\n\nIt is very good for everyone involved that you be very clear on this issue. \n\nYou do not owe them a living in their old age, or at any time. \n\nThey are adults who have made their own financial decisions. \n\nAs for your financial decisions, you've been through the wringer with your parents during your formative years. Consider a therapist and a financial planner. Set yourself up to have a healthy relationship with money. You may have kids one day and want to be able to pass on healthy financial skills.", "NTA OP especially when they forced you out when u were younger. Plus even if they hadn\u2019t children don\u2019t owe parents anything like the other person already said. You gotta live your life", "NTA\n\nparents who do the bare minimum or less don't deserve anything from their children later in life, they didn't earn a reciprocal relationship from you. also i absolutely detest parents who have kids and fully expect said kids to be their retirement plan. \n\nblock them all and ignore them, they are not your responsibility, they're adults and they need to figure out their own stuff. they sound incredible jealous that you have a good life without them so don't ever let them drag you down and ruin what you have made for yourself", "NTA. Culture doesn't matter in this regard. You're not your parents retirement/slave. You're your own independent human.

However, because you are thinking twice about it I am guessing that if things were different, perhaps if they sincerely apologized and stopped trying to run your life maybe you might want them in your life to some degree.  If not, fine.
