It's not that I avoid them, I just don't ever reach out to them and only pick up calls every few months. I'll explain why.\n\nIt all started when I realized I was the black sheep in my family and it's never going to change and they're never going accept who I am. I'm not special or different, I'm just a white washed kid who grew up in a very Asian gangster household. They wear all high end clothing, drive expensive cars. I'm a skater/outdoors kid, I spent all my time outdoors, they did not understand it.\n\nAt 19, after been bullied, failed attempts at being manipulation - constantly being told I'm a crack head(I don't drink alcohol, didn't smoke weed until I was 22) because I skated; I packed my things up and moved out with out saying anything. My mom was hesitant at first and demanded I come home, this is where the NC started, I've been telling her for the last 8 years, if she's going to call it's not to tell me how to live me life. And after all that time of me hanging up the phone, anytime she starts going on about my life, she still doesn't get it and just calls back a few weeks later.\n\nI've been fully self sufficient since grade 10, they were consistently out of town for work(later I found one of them was just always on vacation and the other one was living in Asian with his wife - also did not he got remarried) After I left, my plan has always been, take nothing, owe nothing. I justified it because growing up, they favored my sibling and gave her everything! I'm talking LV, gucci, D&G etc when she was in grade 10, brand new Iphone when it came out and a new BMW when she turned 17 and got her license. I had to pay for everything with my lunch money and none of them even showed up to my ceremony. I later found out my parents left us $30k for the 6 months they were gone and my sister took it for her bills. They've paid for all her bills because she stayed at home and didn't move out until she was 27.\n\nAnyways, after all that, I haven't taken a single dime from them since I left 10 years ago. I have a ton of very close friends - I call them my chosen family. I still continue to do everything I do - I travel almost every weekend. My parents hate it all - they don't like me having \"white\" friends and they don't like me traveling because I need to work harder.\n\nFor reference, my sister makes $70k max while I do about $120k, I have great life long friends - my chosen family. And I'm happy that they're not really in my life anymore.\n\nThis has been burdening my mind for the last while, and I really want to believe it's fair that I feel this way. I'm just wondering why they think they're going to get away with it know what they have provided for me vs my sister.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to take care of them when they're old?", "created_utc": 1681413434, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12l06y2/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_im_not_taking/", "score": 415, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would you? They haven\u2019t done their part as parents, so you have no obligations towards them. Also, if they are so flush with money, they have the means to make necessary arrangements for their old age.", "NTA, children don\u2019t owe their parents for being born, I\u2019d say the same if they were good parents to you.

But culturally, they were supposed to treat you like a son for at least a little while. So no need to worry about it", "NTA I'm not sure why you take their calls just for them to criticise you. It takes a toll on you.", "Absolutely NTA.  And it's actually good to let them know in no uncertain terms sooner rather than later, so they can plan their lives accordingly.", "NTA.

She's the one who profited most while you were largely treated like a bad decorative feature in the house for not gelling with their personal lifestyle. I know that isn't exactly jiving with the whole concept of filial piety enshrined in several cultures, but I mean...what did they expect? \n\nIt sounds like they raised you in a country that wasn't asian, and you absorbed the spirit of independence prominent in western cultures, and have aspired to not be attached to them in any fashion. Everything that you have, everything that you've achieved, it has all been yours to own and boast about. For them to turn around and demand payout for something they never approved of in the first place is the height of parental entitlement.", "NTA, I had a similar talk with my parents to assure them that I would not be a part of a home health care strategy.\n\nOh, and \u201dTake nothing, owe nothing,\u201d I\u2019m going to borrow that. An excellent philosopby, thank you", "NTA. I have always said that I didn\u2019t have my kid to take care of me when I get old. I\u2019ve seen what happens in those situations. The burnout. The minute that I unable to take care of myself I will check myself into a nursing home.", "NTA. Not at all. Parents create their children. They brought you into the world. The child owes the parent exactly ZERO. \"Oh, but GrimmTrixX! They paid for your food and shelter until you moved out,\" Umm...yea, that's literally the parents' job both morally and legally until they are age 18. Now, my father passed in Jan 2022. It was fairly unexpected , he had problems and vices that ultimately killed him at age 71. \n\nBut my mother is still very much alive. But I have literally no money to take care of her if she ever needs care. I have like zero dollars to my name. So if whatever money she has can 100% cover her cost of living, then maybe I will help out.

They simply want assurance that at the end of this cruel game you\u2019ll still take care of them better than they\u2019ve taken care of you. That\u2019s delusional. You don\u2019t owe them anything.\nFrankly, I\u2019d drop picking up every few months to every 6 months, then every year, then block them on social media and change your phone number to an unlisted one. Low Contact only works if the other party is trying to improve. Time for actual No Contact when they start the emotional abuse of guilt/tripping.", "NTA chosen family > blood any day.

Be proud of what you have made of your life.", "NTA - sure its the sister role, given she stayed home til she was 27.", "ESH. Sad for all of you but probably way beyond fixing. It clearly bothers you too or you would not have come here to vent. Best wishes.", "You\u2019re only feeling a slight sense of guilt bc you\u2019re Asian and Asian cultures place a high priority with family and respecting elders.
