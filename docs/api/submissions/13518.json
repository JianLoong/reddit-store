We are expecting our first child together in three weeks but I have an 8 year old from a previous relationship. \n\nTo put it lightly Bill has no filter whatsoever. It\u2019s extremely annoying at times since I\u2019m someone that over thinks everything and will go over what I\u2019m about to say 10 times before it leaves my mouth to make sure it\u2019s not rude, he thinks there might be something wrong with him because he doesn\u2019t understand social cues and is pretty awkward but won\u2019t get it checked or anything. \n\nToday I went for an appointment and they did a 4d ultrasound because they haven\u2019t been able to see his face lately due to him always sucking his thumb. I\u2019ve never had a 4d ultrasound before and was so excited to see my baby. Of course like all 4d ultrasounds the baby looked like a crisp lasagna when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at but still cute and exciting seeing your baby and all their facial features for the first time. \n\nI got home and waited for Bill to come home so I could show him the photos and videos. I have him sit down and I clicked on the best clearest photo we got to show him first (a few photos he had his hand up or was at a bad angle or the umbilical cord was giving him a handlebar mustache) he looks at the photo and I\u2019m pointing out there\u2019s his eyes and nose and mouth etc and the first thing out of his mouth is \u201cwow he\u2019s ugly\u201d immediately I get mad, lock my phone and refuse to show him any other photos. He asked if that was the only photo I got and I said \u201cno I got more but why tf would I show them to you if you\u2019re just going to sit there and call my baby ugly?

He\u2019s mad that I won\u2019t show him the rest and still doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. I am pregnant so maybe it\u2019s just hormones getting to me so AITA?

Your husbands poor attempt at a joke (not even because its offensive just because it's not funny) was a stupid thing to say.\n\nYou need to grow up though.

Say that you realize that you have been setting an irreverent tone and that hubby was keeping in a similar vein. However, given that the baby will be here soon and you have an 8 year old that you need to be modeling good behavior for, you want both you and your husband to scale back negative comments like that. It's going to be a real person and both of you probably wouldn't appreciate someone else calling the baby ugly or a little shit.

Regardless of whether or not you\u2019ve called the baby unsavoury names while being in pain he is failing to recognize how his comments are making you feel. Once he realized how it made you feel he should\u2019ve apologized profusely. \n\nIt isn\u2019t being blunt or honest, it\u2019s just disrespectful. Even if the baby is objectively odd looking in the 4D pictures he didn\u2019t have to say that out loud. \n\nI think there are much deeper issues going on in your relationship with your husband. It seems like you\u2019re beginning to see them so I suggest you take a long look at if you think the relationship can be mended and plan if it can\u2019t be. I hope the rest of your pregnancy goes well and you have a safe birth!", "\"He should be allowed to call the baby ugly and also said hopefully that\u2019s not how he\u2019ll look when he comes out.\"\n\nI wonder what he'll say if the kid does turn out to be \"ugly.\" Or fat.

You know he \"doesn't have a filter,\" you've referred to the baby as \"this little shit\" and those pictures are always weird.  It's *his* baby too and you have no right to withhold pictures.", "YTA. Saying a baby is ugly in an ugly picture is definitely better than calling your baby a little shit. So, you're right; it is different.", "YTA Grow up. Show him the pictures. Those ultrasounds do make the baby look ugly. You call the baby names and commented several times on how the pictures made the baby look odd but you expect him to say nothing but compliments? Do as I say, not as I do? If you withhold, you are encouraging distance in your marraige. Should he do better? Yes, but its confusing.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to be upset because it hurt your feelings, but he\u2019s allowed to think a creepy ultrasound is ugly. Newborn babies are usually kinda weird looking, and we all just lie to the parents because they are too deep in their baby love to see it. He\u2019ll be in that love stupor when the baby is born too and you\u2019ll both think your little mole rat looking baby is adorable.

Are you happy with him?", "NTA but when those first came out, I did one when I was pregnant with my son and that was my first thought too. He isn\u2019t, but those things are creepy, you can\u2019t hold it against someone. Typically we all want to be with someone that we don\u2019t have to filter every thought we have before saying it. Maybe sit and talk, but if that\u2019s your biggest issue it can probably be worked through.", "NTA even a stranger would say baby's cute regardless of the grainy image. He's so out of order. I'm so sorry he is becoming a father with that mentality. What will he say when baby's born? Oh they look gross and squashed?", "ESH.

It definitely doesn't make you not one.\n\nIn fact, sometimes the way autistic people present, they can't avoid constantly putting their foot in their mouth. \n\nThis reads, like a classic case of undiagnosed autism, I'm 35, and it was really common in our generation.\n\nPlus, undiagnosed autism, can lead to things like PTSD, from having misunderstandings, and misperceptions of the world.\n\nYour behavior, actually strikes me as toxic positivity. Which is when you hold someone accountable unfairly for things out of their control *edit* just because they make you uncomfortable* and for someone with undiagnosed autism, that can definitely be one of those things.\n\nYou're husband, is co-signing his symptoms, when he says, \"I've always felt different and like something was wrong.\"\n\nWhich is sad. If you both are in agreement that something is off, the best course of action is going to be testing, and therapy to confirm or deny these suspicions.\n\nNot withholding photos of his unborn child.\n\nYTA.", "Esh - all newborns have their moments when they look like weird little alien potatoes. Yes even the one i gestated.  Especially when they are red faced and screaming.  \n\nUltrasounds magnify that and while your husband should have kept his insensitive comment to himself he really should realize that just because newborns look weird that you can't love them. \n\nGood luck with your birth!", "YTA omg relax! It\u2019s a grainy image of a blob, no is calling your unborn fetus a monster. He cracked a joke, lighten up", "NTA - you got pregnancy hormones going into overdrive and your husband called the baby ugly.\nHe\u2019s also refusing to get medical care for an emergent issue which is a HUGE asshole moment. That needs to be fixed asap.", "YTA. Do you want to bond with your husband and baby or do you just want to be right? You made your point. You know who your husband is....and you married him for it.

Thats not missing social ques, that's just being an asshole.", "NTA just because you\u2019re pregnant\u2026 calling the baby a little shit is much worse than calling a 3d ultrasound of it ugly", "NTA-Is your husband on the spectrum? If he has trouble with filter might be the issue.", "NTA\n\nBut for real, babies are gross lookin, particularly in ultrasounds.

You are totally within your rights to be upset by what he said; we all have feelings and feelings are valid. But\u2026 he\u2019s not wrong. All of those ultrasound pictures are pretty hideous.

Ultrasound pics are ugly and creepy. You must have at least guessed that something like this would come out of his mouth", "NAH \n \nI get it you went into straight mama bear don\u2019t call my kid names mode.

Please be careful.", "In what ways has he changed?", "I mean, you keep saying he\u2019s always an asshole, so it seems a fair assumption that he\u2019s be an asshole. Yeah, I agree he\u2019s a dick here, but my sister in Christ there are only so many times you should throw yourself out onto a shooting range and be surprised you get shot. \n\nGet a divorce or at minimum see a marriage counselor to address your husbands behavior.", " Even saying that a baby looks ugly/funny in the picture is different than labeling the baby itself as ugly.", "Why did you have a baby.", "In the beginning, my little big looked like Deadpool.

It freaked the living f\\*\\*k out of me. I felt like Sigourney Weaver in Alien. When I told my husband he laughed and reminded me that it wasn't an alien but our child. When I showed him it happening for the first time he jumped up and hid behind a curtain. As you say internet friend, FUN TIMES!!", "Red flag alert", "Nope. If it helps make you feel better, you can google how they take chest X-rays of born babies. Looks awkward but adorable all at the same time.", "I'm not worried about how he feels. I'll just explain I have no filter.", "He should be willing to do those things already because she's his wife. You're talking about a man who is already denying his role in deciding to have that baby and continues to act like an ass after he hurts his pregnant wife's feelings.
