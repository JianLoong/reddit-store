We are expecting our first child together in three weeks but I have an 8 year old from a previous relationship. \n\nTo put it lightly Bill has no filter whatsoever. It\u2019s extremely annoying at times since I\u2019m someone that over thinks everything and will go over what I\u2019m about to say 10 times before it leaves my mouth to make sure it\u2019s not rude, he thinks there might be something wrong with him because he doesn\u2019t understand social cues and is pretty awkward but won\u2019t get it checked or anything. \n\nToday I went for an appointment and they did a 4d ultrasound because they haven\u2019t been able to see his face lately due to him always sucking his thumb. I\u2019ve never had a 4d ultrasound before and was so excited to see my baby. Of course like all 4d ultrasounds the baby looked like a crisp lasagna when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at but still cute and exciting seeing your baby and all their facial features for the first time. \n\nI got home and waited for Bill to come home so I could show him the photos and videos. I have him sit down and I clicked on the best clearest photo we got to show him first (a few photos he had his hand up or was at a bad angle or the umbilical cord was giving him a handlebar mustache) he looks at the photo and I\u2019m pointing out there\u2019s his eyes and nose and mouth etc and the first thing out of his mouth is \u201cwow he\u2019s ugly\u201d immediately I get mad, lock my phone and refuse to show him any other photos. He asked if that was the only photo I got and I said \u201cno I got more but why tf would I show them to you if you\u2019re just going to sit there and call my baby ugly? I was so excited to show you these and you\u2019ve completely ruined the moment because you don\u2019t know how to shut your damn mouth\u201d he looked shocked that I was mad and said it\u2019s fair game because I call the baby names all the time (when I\u2019m in a ton of pain I will say things like \u201cthis little shit won\u2019t get out of my ribs\u201d) I told him it was completely different and he claims it\u2019s not and he should be allowed to call the baby ugly and also said hopefully that\u2019s not how he\u2019ll look when he comes out.\n\nI just refused to show him any more photos and told him to get out of the room. He\u2019s mad that I won\u2019t show him the rest and still doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. I am pregnant so maybe it\u2019s just hormones getting to me so AITA? Did I overreact or is he just an idiot?\n\nEDIT: to answer some comments I keep getting asked. \n\n\u201cIs he on the spectrum\u201d We don\u2019t know. He and I have both stated that might be the case but he refuses to get tested because he\u2019s scared he might be. I understand this is an issue but I can\u2019t force him to go. I\u2019ve encouraged him as much as I can and as often as I can but he doesn\u2019t want to get a diagnosis. \n\n\u201cHe was joking\u201d unfortunately he was not. I poked fun at these types of ultrasounds in my post. I can joke around about it easily the problem is he did not say it in any slight amount of a joking away it was \u201cwow he\u2019s ugly\u201d 100% serious and matter a fact. This was a final straw moment for me because I\u2019ve been on him for the past two weeks about his comments like that about people others. He\u2019s been saying very shallow judgmental things and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t call the baby \u2018my baby\u2019 it\u2019s both of yours\u201d I understand where you\u2019re coming from but there\u2019s a reason I called him my baby. We got married agree we wanted to try for a baby and tried for several months, this was not a surprise and we both decided we wanted a baby. After I got pregnant any single little \u201cow\u201d \u201cthat was uncomfortable\u201d \u201cI\u2019m throwing up blood from all this morning sickness\u201d or anything that wasn\u2019t just absolute praise to the baby I was to \u201cwell you wanted this\u201d every time. I explained how much I didn\u2019t like him saying that because it sounds like I\u2019m the only one that wants the baby and he doesn\u2019t give a shit and still says it. We \u201ccompromised\u201d and as a running joke now I call him \u201cmy baby because I\u2019m the one that wanted him\u201d when talking about the baby Bill will often say \u201cmy boy\u201d or our baby I never corrected him or have ever said no it\u2019s my baby not yours because it\u2019s not that serious but that\u2019s why I said \u201cmy baby\u201d in the post\n\nA ton of comments are saying I\u2019m tah because \u201cbabies are ugly\u201d if you can look your excited pregnant wife in the eyes as she\u2019s expressing her joy over seeing the baby that you guys will be holding in just a few short weeks and respond with its ugly then you are the problem there\u2019s a million other things you can say and now after I give birth on what should be an amazing moment I\u2019m going to be scared that he\u2019s going to say that again instead of focusing on my baby I\u2019m going to worry if my husband is thinking the baby\u2019s ugly. Luckily thanks to some lovely redditors I have the comeback \u201che looks just like you\u201d in my pocket now. \n\nI\u2019ve answered a lot in the comments please just look for my replies but I wanted to point out that I wasn\u2019t a joke, I said my baby for a reason, and he might be on the spectrum but refuses to get tested. I didn\u2019t show him the rest of the photos because I showed him the best one you could see his face and chubby cheeks perfectly it didn\u2019t look creepy or weird so if he could look at the best picture and say eww why would I show him the rest that have his hand in the way or shot a bad angle? There\u2019s no point in me having to get my feelings repeatedly hurt just so he can see photos that are considered mess ups anyway", "created_utc": 1680130243, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1263gss/aita_for_refusing_to_show_my_husband_the_rest_of/", "score": 2492, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

ESH", "YTA - I get it made you upset you had a huge over reaction though. Babies can be ugly.

Say that you realize that you have been setting an irreverent tone and that hubby was keeping in a similar vein. However, given that the baby will be here soon and you have an 8 year old that you need to be modeling good behavior for, you want both you and your husband to scale back negative comments like that. It's going to be a real person and both of you probably wouldn't appreciate someone else calling the baby ugly or a little shit.

You call the baby names and commented several times on how the pictures made the baby look odd but you expect him to say nothing but compliments? Do as I say, not as I do?

You\u2019re allowed to be upset because it hurt your feelings, but he\u2019s allowed to think a creepy ultrasound is ugly. Newborn babies are usually kinda weird looking, and we all just lie to the parents because they are too deep in their baby love to see it.

Which is when you hold someone accountable unfairly for things out of their control *edit* just because they make you uncomfortable* and for someone with undiagnosed autism, that can definitely be one of those things.\n\nYou're husband, is co-signing his symptoms, when he says, \"I've always felt different and like something was wrong.\"\n\nWhich is sad.

Leave.", "My first baby kicked my ribs so hard I\u2019m convinced he cracked them, it hurt to move or breathe.", "If you clutch those pearls any harder they\u2019ll be embedded.", "If he was bashing newly opened Christmas gifts he probably hasn\u2019t changed.  She\u2019s not looking at him with the roses color glasses anymore.", "That last sentence alone is not of a caring man. It's common for such abuse to start only after marriage or having a kid", "Based on your comments, it sounds more like he refuses therapy etc because he is perfectly happy treating you this way and sees nothing wrong with it.   'Fear he'll be told something is wrong with him' is just an excuse to weasel out of some professional acknowledging that he's *choosing* to act this way.  \n\nEverything you've said about him points towards him *NOT* having an actual issue with managing his behaviour *when he wants* to.  He didn't have trouble reining his mouth in for *years* before you got married.  He doesn't have trouble reining his mouth in at work.  He didn't have problems with gaming before you got married.  He just kept on his best behaviour before you got tied down (marriage / baby), and now he's relaxing and showing you his true colours.  \n\nIt's sad, but you need to realise that *this* is the man you're (currently) tied to, not the Mr Nice Guy he was acting like before.  There's every possibility that he may get *even worse*.  He isn't going to change without a major slap up the side of the head with a clue-by-four.  And it's not just you he's going to treat this way; there's a very high likelihood that he will do the same with your children.\n\nBuild your support circle asap and give him some ultimatums.  Maybe, you'll get super lucky and he'll start behaving like a reasonable human being again.  Maybe.  But if not, you have to decide just how much you are willing to put yourself and your children through.", "> But he was never upset about her calling the baby a \"little shit\" in the first place. He is only bringing it up now to invalidate her feelings over him calling it \"ugly\".\n\nimagine what would happen if he said he was upset though. We'd have another post from her saying \"aita for getting mad that my husband didnt like me calling my baby a little shit\"", "I\u2019m sure he will take plenty during his custody weeks.", "My nephew came out like that, I was shocked when I saw him too", "Wait what\u2019s the sound? Or, more specifically, which part of the baby is making the sound?", "I see your point. I was also diagnosed late. I was 39, and in a very similar situation as you.", "No, but you can give constant encouragement, and ease their fears they have about going. \n\nI mean, it's really easy to judge someone you've never met and look for excuses to throw up your hands.", "Lmao @ you thinking this dude is going to agree to  anything more than every other weekend and Tuesday nights. But yeah, this marriage is for sure over", "Totally depends on cook time, I agree. My first came out underdone.  Second baby? Cooked to perfection", "Why is that on her? She is already handling enough and saying \"they\" need to get *him* diagnosed is putting the burden back on OP. Women are not the defacto caregivers for romantic partners.", "My brother looked like a literal cherub. I on the other hand looked like a weird skinny alien haha", "She doesn't need to fix him. Just find a way to get him to realize he needs help.\n\nShe doesn't need to be his caregiver.\n\nAnd, FYI, if it wasn't for my partner being patient with me, and me with him, we both would have never ended up encouraging each other to go get tested.\n\nWe've been together for 2 years now, and each got tested within a year of one another.\n\nI was 35. And he was 28. \n\nSo, I know from experience what it can take, and how frustrating it can be.", "And using these clever cop outs about \"women shouldn't\" are just an excuse for ablist garbage.\n\nMaybe, everyone needs to stop telling women what they should and shouldn't do in their own relationships."]}
