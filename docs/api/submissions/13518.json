We are expecting our first child together in three weeks but I have an 8 year old from a previous relationship. \n\nTo put it lightly Bill has no filter whatsoever. It\u2019s extremely annoying at times since I\u2019m someone that over thinks everything and will go over what I\u2019m about to say 10 times before it leaves my mouth to make sure it\u2019s not rude, he thinks there might be something wrong with him because he doesn\u2019t understand social cues and is pretty awkward but won\u2019t get it checked or anything. \n\nToday I went for an appointment and they did a 4d ultrasound because they haven\u2019t been able to see his face lately due to him always sucking his thumb. I\u2019ve never had a 4d ultrasound before and was so excited to see my baby. Of course like all 4d ultrasounds the baby looked like a crisp lasagna when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at but still cute and exciting seeing your baby and all their facial features for the first time. \n\nI got home and waited for Bill to come home so I could show him the photos and videos. I have him sit down and I clicked on the best clearest photo we got to show him first (a few photos he had his hand up or was at a bad angle or the umbilical cord was giving him a handlebar mustache) he looks at the photo and I\u2019m pointing out there\u2019s his eyes and nose and mouth etc and the first thing out of his mouth is \u201cwow he\u2019s ugly\u201d immediately I get mad, lock my phone and refuse to show him any other photos. He asked if that was the only photo I got and I said \u201cno I got more but why tf would I show them to you if you\u2019re just going to sit there and call my baby ugly? I was so excited to show you these and you\u2019ve completely ruined the moment because you don\u2019t know how to shut your damn mouth\u201d he looked shocked that I was mad and said it\u2019s fair game because I call the baby names all the time (when I\u2019m in a ton of pain I will say things like \u201cthis little shit won\u2019t get out of my ribs\u201d) I told him it was completely different and he claims it\u2019s not and he should be allowed to call the baby ugly and also said hopefully that\u2019s not how he\u2019ll look when he comes out.\n\nI just refused to show him any more photos and told him to get out of the room. He\u2019s mad that I won\u2019t show him the rest and still doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. I am pregnant so maybe it\u2019s just hormones getting to me so AITA? Did I overreact or is he just an idiot?\n\nEDIT: to answer some comments I keep getting asked. \n\n\u201cIs he on the spectrum\u201d We don\u2019t know. He and I have both stated that might be the case but he refuses to get tested because he\u2019s scared he might be. I understand this is an issue but I can\u2019t force him to go. I\u2019ve encouraged him as much as I can and as often as I can but he doesn\u2019t want to get a diagnosis. \n\n\u201cHe was joking\u201d unfortunately he was not. I poked fun at these types of ultrasounds in my post. I can joke around about it easily the problem is he did not say it in any slight amount of a joking away it was \u201cwow he\u2019s ugly\u201d 100% serious and matter a fact. This was a final straw moment for me because I\u2019ve been on him for the past two weeks about his comments like that about people others. He\u2019s been saying very shallow judgmental things and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t call the baby \u2018my baby\u2019 it\u2019s both of yours\u201d I understand where you\u2019re coming from but there\u2019s a reason I called him my baby. We got married agree we wanted to try for a baby and tried for several months, this was not a surprise and we both decided we wanted a baby. After I got pregnant any single little \u201cow\u201d \u201cthat was uncomfortable\u201d \u201cI\u2019m throwing up blood from all this morning sickness\u201d or anything that wasn\u2019t just absolute praise to the baby I was to \u201cwell you wanted this\u201d every time. I explained how much I didn\u2019t like him saying that because it sounds like I\u2019m the only one that wants the baby and he doesn\u2019t give a shit and still says it. We \u201ccompromised\u201d and as a running joke now I call him \u201cmy baby because I\u2019m the one that wanted him\u201d when talking about the baby Bill will often say \u201cmy boy\u201d or our baby I never corrected him or have ever said no it\u2019s my baby not yours because it\u2019s not that serious but that\u2019s why I said \u201cmy baby\u201d in the post\n\nA ton of comments are saying I\u2019m tah because \u201cbabies are ugly\u201d if you can look your excited pregnant wife in the eyes as she\u2019s expressing her joy over seeing the baby that you guys will be holding in just a few short weeks and respond with its ugly then you are the problem there\u2019s a million other things you can say and now after I give birth on what should be an amazing moment I\u2019m going to be scared that he\u2019s going to say that again instead of focusing on my baby I\u2019m going to worry if my husband is thinking the baby\u2019s ugly. Luckily thanks to some lovely redditors I have the comeback \u201che looks just like you\u201d in my pocket now. \n\nI\u2019ve answered a lot in the comments please just look for my replies but I wanted to point out that I wasn\u2019t a joke, I said my baby for a reason, and he might be on the spectrum but refuses to get tested. I didn\u2019t show him the rest of the photos because I showed him the best one you could see his face and chubby cheeks perfectly it didn\u2019t look creepy or weird so if he could look at the best picture and say eww why would I show him the rest that have his hand in the way or shot a bad angle? There\u2019s no point in me having to get my feelings repeatedly hurt just so he can see photos that are considered mess ups anyway", "created_utc": 1680130243, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1263gss/aita_for_refusing_to_show_my_husband_the_rest_of/", "score": 4022, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Say that you realize that you have been setting an irreverent tone and that hubby was keeping in a similar vein. However, given that the baby will be here soon and you have an 8 year old that you need to be modeling good behavior for, you want both you and your husband to scale back negative comments like that. It's going to be a real person and both of you probably wouldn't appreciate someone else calling the baby ugly or a little shit.

However, he's also an asshole - not based on this one instance, but on the picture you're painting as a whole. Even if many of us often have no intuition about what is socially appropriate or not, we have a thinking brain (well, at least most people do, I guess) and can apologize and learn from a past experience. He's probably never going to *not* be blunt, but he's also an adult, and thus perfectly capable of learning to respect other people's feelings about things when they've been clearly stated, *even if they don't make sense to him*.\n\nIn a normal situation, I'd agree with him. Babies are ugly to me. I wouldn't be offended if someone told me a baby is ugly. I might even blurt it out to an expecting mother. In a balanced dynamic, you could give him grace for blurting out that kind of thing, explain your feelings about it, and trust that he'd do his best to avoid upsetting you in the future (especially seeing that you're pregnant). Past experience shows he won't make an effort, so you are already very reactive. To be clear, your reaction in this particular instance does seem over the top to me, but considering past instances and the fact you're pregnant, I totally understand it. I'm also pregnant and I know how much more riled up I get.\n\nUnfortunately, the 'I'm just stating the truth' attitude is often a problem of male entitlement, and not from being autistic or otherwise neurodivergent.  Simply put, he sees no reason to mitigate that - the fact that he's upsetting you doesn't seem to be clicking for him. I'm afraid those communication differences are going to get progressively worse as resentment grows. You can try to bridge the communication gap, but he must also put in some effort on his side, and for that he must see the need for that effort instead of thinking his way is the superior way. Perhaps couples counselling could help, depending on what you have available in your area?\n\nIf you want more info, look up the 'double empathy problem', it's a good starting point to understand the depth of the issue. Also, there's a saying I once read in the autistic community and which stuck with me: neurodivergency is not a reason for moral incompetency.

Your baby is ugly \n2. You look fat in this outfit (just before going out) \n3. I hate your gift ( when he\u2019s handmade) \n\u2026. \n\nIs it true? yes! Is it the time to shut up and smile?

We got married agree we wanted to try for a baby and tried for several months, this was not a surprise and we both decided we wanted a baby.

We \u201ccompromised\u201d and as a running joke now I call him \u201cmy baby because I\u2019m the one that wanted him\u201d when talking about the baby Bill will often say \u201cmy boy\u201d or our baby I never corrected him or have ever said no it\u2019s my baby not yours because it\u2019s not that serious but that\u2019s why I said \u201cmy baby\u201d in the post\"\n\nThis doesn't sound promising to their relationship at all", "Just saw a horrible meme\u2026 something like, \u201cGet sober after your wife of ten years leaves you for being an abusive alcoholic\u2026 so that she knows you could have quit at any time.\u201d", "In any instance where someone shows the ability to filter, depending on circumstance, they are choosing to be an asshole to you.

He can\u2019t control his filter, and he\u2019s afraid of getting a positive diagnosis.  I can understand that fear, but it isn\u2019t an excuse to not get tested.  He needs to put his pride away and get the help he needs, especially if he\u2019s going to be a father.  Kids will parrot anything they hear after all.  Plus the added stress of having a kid will only make any problems he has even worse.  Is it really a good idea to let that happen?\n\n2). He\u2019s lying and can definitely control what he says.  In this case, he won\u2019t get the diagnosis because he knows it will be negative, and then he won\u2019t have the excuse of \u201cwell I might be autistic\u201d to hide behind anymore.  He will have to admit that he said terrible things without putting in the effort to consider others, and he will have to apologize for that, and then stop saying those things in the future. \n\nEither way, he needs to stop being selfish and prideful.  Make him get tested.  He\u2019s going to be a father.  There\u2019s no room for nonsense when you\u2019re a father.", "First off: loads of people avoid seeing a doctor for all kinds of physical and mental ailments. Sometimes because they don't want it confirmed that they're seriously ill. It's denial, not apathy.\n\nSecond: autism is not comparable to cancer. Cancer gets worse and kills if left untreated, and in many cases can be treated and cured.

It\u2019s not about the statement the husband made. It\u2019s the fact that she was excited to show him ultrasound pics and he couldn\u2019t even bother to be excited with her.
