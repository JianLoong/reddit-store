Ask her if they can afford a kid and where they would live?  Chances are logic won\u2019t beat her hormones but she needs a wake up call.

It sounds like your friend may have some mental health issues, honestly. To decide to have a kid under those circumstances is, frankly, insane. And given that she doesn't live on her own and doesn't support herself, her reckless decision would have affected more people than just her. Bringing in her mom was the right choice. No different than if you found out your friend was self-harming or suicidal. This was above your pay grade as a friend and another trusted person was needed to help your friend see sense.", "NTA!!!!

If she continues to try to be with this low life then she will deserve whats coming to her.", "I'll be in the minority. NTA\n\nIs your friend technically an adult? Yes. But this is something that would likely disproportionately impact her mother if Friend is successful. (Cuz let's be fair- Friend and baby would end up back at home with mom in no time. If not just the baby- cuz baby's sound really cute but in reality they're really loud.)", "NTA, OP YOU ARE A LIVE SAVER!\n\nI am so happy you stopped them from having a baby, they don't even have their own house and are already trying for a baby?

But she's grown and that's her choice. If I were her I'd never tell you another important thing in my life ever.", "NTA, I would say y-t-a if this was you tattling on her about literally anything else, but bringing a baby into the world in a bad situation is crazy and you were right to tell her mom.

Hopefully her mom can knock some sense into her.", "This is basically the only time I can call someone a *justified* asshole. \n\nYTA for snitching on an adult and going to their mother about stuff that probably shouldn\u2019t be your business to begin with.\n\nBUT, this was justified. I\u2019m taking from this that you didn\u2019t mean any ill intent, just some concern for a friend. \n\nBut this is a grey area in terms of assholeness.

Better yet, how exactly does she think they\u2019d be able to buy a house after saving for just a few months? It doesn\u2019t sound like either would have any significant earnings or savings. Unless either of them wins the lottery or houses are $20 where you live, they\u2019d end up reliant on their families for years to come. Provided that their families didn\u2019t kick them out for intentionally doing this.", "Justified AH (going with NTA overall for the vote but you are in a good way). \n\nThe minute she brings an innocent baby into this f\u2019d up situation, you really have no good options to help. She is dependent, he is dependent, and they want to make their own dependent when they don\u2019t even take care of themselves. While living THREE hours away from each other! You say she has BPD that is currently being treated with med adjustments\u2014ie they haven\u2019t found the right dose/med situation to control her BPD\u2014 so she is not in the right headspace to make this kind of decision. You are right to intervene even if that is generally considered being a bad friend because it would make you a worse friend to let her make this bad and unrealistic decision at this point in time.", "Kinda both. I mean to NTA\n\nYou could be TA for getting too involved into your friend's beeswax and snitching, like it's her life, if she wants to fuck it up, let her. \n\nBut at the same time, you're not TA because your were looking out for her. She could be regretting this severely a year later. Being a parent is a big thing, and so early as well.", "I tend towards NTA.\n\nYour friend is legally an adult, and she has the right to make her own decisions in life.\n\nHowever,\n\n1) so does her mother. That's her car, and she deserves to know what it's being used for.\n\n2) her behaviour, from what you've told us, sounds kind of ... different. I don't want to do the whole armchair diagnosis thing here, but hopping in and out of relationships, getting way too serious way too quickly, and wanting a baby 5 months in with a dude she hasn't even lived with yet???\n\nGet her mother to suggest therapy. There may be something under the hood there.", "NTA\n\nSome people need to be saved from themselves. Your friend sounds as though she is not playing with a full set of bocce balls.

In generally I'm very anti-getting parents involved in an adult child's bad choices but I'd make an exception here for three reasons. 1) She is using her mom's resources for this and would likely need to further rely on them in the event of a child, which her mom has not signed up for.  2) She has BPD and this can affect rational decision making. And 3) This is a decision that will result in an actual human child whose life will be shaped and likely deeply messed up by her choices.", "YTA\n\nWere you an asshole? Yeah.

A baby isn\u2019t a tattoo or piercing- it is a new human being who has thoughts and feelings. They will have to support this child for a *minimum* of 18 years and it doesn\u2019t sound like the relationship is super sturdy at this time.

If I were her I would be cutting your out of my life permanently, regardless of the good intentions or not. You have your own particular brand of toxic going on", "ESH", "NTA. You probably just saved a kid from a lifetime of shitty parenting", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re a good friend. I\u2019d rather my friend hate me than watch her go down that path and not stop her.\n\nYou mentioned her diagnosis. I was once told I have BPD, borderline/not bipolar, though that\u2019s also in the list of things I\u2019ve had over 14 years - now I\u2019m getting diagnostics done for ASD(women often get labelled with mood disorders cause how ASD displays in women etc.). There are also attachment issues etc. that may make someone behave like her, regardless of diagnosis.\n\nIt would be hard to say if this has to do with BPD, could be related/separate attachment issues - or she\u2019s got an underlying thing she needs help with. \n\nWhatever the case I hope you can talk her mom into taking this to therapy - and not fighting it out with your friend. I\u2019d stray away from her diagnosis cause that label doesn\u2019t help anyone, that\u2019s why I elaborated a bit - not to imply you should check her diagnosis but that you should not use it here necessarily.", "You're a huge asshole", "YTA. Mind your own business at all times. Your best friend is about to be your former friend. Unsolicited advice is more than enough.  Once you start sabotaging someone else's relationship you cross a major red line. And it's hard to walk it back. Worry about your own love life.", "OP, don't feel bad over it but you done the right thing by preventing her from making a terrible mistake with that guy. Secondly, I believe you are also helping her to dodge a bullet in case that guy might harm her so NTA", "Hope she knows if and what meds she can take when trying to get pregnant and potentially being pregnant?\nLike\u2026that\u2019s serious health risks she might be taking there for her and her unborn.", "It's not like this is likely to put an end to this long-term though", "Back in my early 20s, my shrink was expecting significant improvement in my symptoms, and when I couldn't articulate any differences after A WEEK, he'd change my meds. \n\nSome psychs are just bad.", "Yeah. And some are just pill pushers with no care of the consequences!", "they are talking any borderline personality disorder but bipolar"]}
