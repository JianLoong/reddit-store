It\u2019s a quiet neighbourhood with mostly families.\n\nI am 30, f, no kids, running a small business from home full-time. I was lucky enough succeed and make it my full time job for the past 4 years. I\u2019ll admit, I am very privileged considering how much flexibility I have and that I am not responsible for children in the current crisis.\n\nI grew up very poor and for the longest time, I hated spending money on anything but essentials and I worked hard to get out of that mindset so I don\u2019t budget my personal money religiously. I typically give myself a weekly \u2018wage\u2019 that I can spend on bills and myself and I typically still have some left over. I know how much I need on average and kind of just go with it without thinking of how much I am spending on individual things. I hope that it makes sense.\n\n \n\nThe house I bough came with electrics on pre-payment meter, the old one that you have to take the key to the shop and top it up there. I never bothered changing it to newer model nor changing to standard bills. It just works for me. Whenever I am going to the post office, I\u2019ll see if it needs topping up and if it\u2019s running low, I\u2019ll take it with me and I\u2019ll top it up for \u00a398. I don\u2019t know how much it lasts me, I just top it up when I need to. It works for me.\n\n \n\nThe other day, I met one of my neighbours we started chatting. She was complaining about heating her house and since our houses are of similar size, she asked how much I was paying. I answered that I honestly didn\u2019t know how much I was paying but could check and get back to her.\n\nShe got offended and asked why I didn\u2019t know so I explained. For some reason, she got really annoyed with me and said that they all know I had money but I didn\u2019t have to flaunt it in their faces all the time (she mentioned how much I order online, most of which are business related, how I have multiple monitors set up in my office plus personal electronics, apparently a neighbour that\u2019s been too my house has been telling everyone how I don\u2019t have a telly but I have all those laptops <I have 2, work and private one> and ipads lying around).\n\nI was shocked at her accusations and tried to explain but she told me I was insensitive to their struggles. The next day, I was working in my office and heard her talking to another neighbour, she was ostensibly loud, standing in front of my house, complaining what a mean bitch I was and that I didn\u2019t know the struggle because I was single, probably because I was stone cold. And the neighbour agreed. And she did the same thing later with another neighbour. She\u2019s now ignoring me and won\u2019t even reply to my \u2018good morning.\u2019\n\nI do feel bad for offending her, I know how it is to struggle but I didn\u2019t think what I did was wrong. I thought I was in the clear until I heard other neighbours agreed with her and I am confused.

You must be the shitty neighbor", "It is when you blame it on your neighbors.", "Its not OPs job.\nBut i would prefer a neighborhood that dont think i suck", "Definitely get a security system, but for pettiness\u2019 sake please order it to be delivered in multiple packages, preferably at a time when she\u2019s home to witness them all turn up ;)\n\nNTA", "[removed]", "[removed]", "But the reason involved here isn't something that affects the neighborhood.\n\nIt's about the OP's bills, finances, and possessions. This isn't about the property or being a nuisance, a pet, loud music, the lawn, parking, or even the color of the home (if we're being picky).\n\nLiterally.... how do you send a letter to say:\n\n'Hey, y'all. Sorry that I have more finances and less responsibilities than the rest of you. Sorry to Mrs. Bucket (of course, it's pronounced Bouquet!!) that I couldn't tell her exactly how much I spend on my electricity every month because I just take my meter and refill it with XX per month. Sorry that I can do that and the rest of you are struggling. Oh by the way, I'm auctioning off my personal laptop and iPad that Nosy Neighbor #1 came and told you all about to begin with. I won't get any other nice things because we all need to have the same stuff. And just so everyone else is comfortable, I'm going to make my Amazon purchases once monthly and I won't even have them deliver it to my house. I will find a pick up depot so none of you is uncomfortable. I promise I am not the cold asshole Mrs. Bucket told you all I was.

NTA And they are never happy for your happiness.", "Completely NTA. You've got a really odd system of electricity there, but as long as it's working for you, then that's fine. You weren't flaunting anything. I dunno how things work in the UK, but here that behavior would at the very least warrant filing a police report for harassment, and possibly incitement if she's announcing loudly all the high ticket items in your home, and the fact that you live alone.", "NTA.  No matter what your response was going to be it was always going to be taken and viewed from the narrow minded perspective of a neighbor who likes to stir the pot with idle gossip, so they have something to b\\*tch and talk about.", "NTA. \nYou didn't know the amount and offered to check so yoi could compare the rates. The alternative would have been to just make up a number, which is kind of dumb. \n\nYou don't owe your neighbour anything, how you keep your finances is your decision.

People are so easily offended these days we all might as well be mute as to not offend anyone.", "NTA the question was out of line to begin with, her further comments were WAY out of line.", "NTA lol this just reminded me of a parent at the school who looked at me like I was a lunatic when I said I don't know how much it takes to fill up my car. I just... don't. My car holds 16 gallons, multiply that by however much gas is I guess. My car has to get filled up either way, what's the point in watching it like a hawk? So I can bitch and moan about it in the car rider line? No thanks, I've got some very important murder podcasts to listen to.", "NTA!  You didn\u2019t offend her.  She is jealous and petty and a troublemaker.  Having a successful home business that you work hard at is not privilege.  Ignore her.  Also, as other posters say, get security cameras.", "NTA. Who even pays attention to how many deliveries a neighbor gets? I'm just glad when a truck stops at someone else's house instead of mine.", "Wow NTA but your neighbors are horrible. I fail to see how anything she berated you for is any of her business in the first place.

Just keep doing you, OP and give 'em a radiant smile whenever you see them and go on.\n\nA camera would be a good idea, this neighbor seems kind of obsessive.", "NTA", "NTA. She sounds like the kind of person looking for an excuse to be offended so she can unleash her small-minded nastiness.

Two computers isn\u2019t weird (though I find multiple iPads for one person a little strange, but you do you). She\u2019s jealous and petty. I couldn\u2019t tell you how much my electric bill is- it\u2019s auto paid online and I\u2019m a couple months behind in doing my budget. Some people have to watch it more closely than that, and I get it- I had to do that in my past too. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m rolling in cash now. Even when I did keep careful track, I didn\u2019t memorize my bills- I could have given a ballpark amount but not exact if asked out of the blue.\n\nShe\u2019s jealous and insecure.
