Somehow your jealousy is his problem? \n\n\"I stayed silent for ages but they didn\u2019t notice they were just continuing the convo so I started sniffing a bit and he asked what was wrong\".\n\nThis is childish, manipulative behavior.

Don't manipulate them into chasing you around, begging you to behave yourself.\n\n\"He tried to talk but ended up leaving the room and going to say goodbye to my friend and explain I was too distressed at that moment.\"\n\nYou have completely overreacted and disrespected your own friend in the process. What's worse, you've shown your boyfriend that your default is tears and pouting over your own insecurities. Did you want him to apologize because he noticed that someone else had body parts? Why? He didn't compare you. He didn't lust after this woman. You are trying to criminalize his thoughts. You're going the right way to let your insecurities ruin your relationship.", "YTA. Not for being upset but for purposely sniffling and then crying cuz he didn't notice you were upset. That's manipulative AF. You took your reaction way out of proportion just for attention.", "Hi, i have BPD. What youre describing isnt BPD, its an attention thing. You didnt get the reaction you wanted so you acted out instead of using your words.\n\nYTA - being toxic and manipulative isnt a symptom of BPD.", "YTA 100% I don't even understand how you could entertain the notion that you're not in the wrong here.\n\nYour boyfriend did absolutely nothing wrong and sounds like a great guy. Your MH issues do not excuse nor justify your behavior. \n\nIf you were feeling upset, you should have just excused yourself in a polite manner and taken a break in another room. It's okay to feel upset or angry or sad, but don't let that ruin other people's moment.", "YTA\n\nParticularly if you do in fact say comments about others you find attractive then to have this kind of reaction.

Unless he was talking about how good her boobs felt, you overreacted by a lot. I understand you have medical issues but you cannot react that way every time he talks about something he liked or maybe something he and an ex did (again, unless he is bragging). It sounds like he was trying to make things better and didn't realize he was being thoughtless. You should apologize to him and your friend.\n\nEdited to add a detail.", "Light YTA. It's one thing to feel upset but you put your partner in an impossible situation. You got upset at him for doing something that you **also do**. When he tried to talk about it, you weren't able to.

You're adults, accept that your partner will be attracted to other people, but that doesn't mean they're going to leave you or cheat at the drop of a hat. It doesn't mean they're *constantly* thinking about other people.\n\nLet's also mention just how goddamn manipulative this is:\n\n>I went silent for ages but they didn\u2019t notice they were just continuing the convo so I started sniffing a bit and he asked what was wrong. \n\nAnd your hypocrisy:\n\n>he mentioned how I say stuff about other men I find attractive & it doesn\u2019t upset him.\n\nI wouldn't blame you if his comment maybe shocked you a little, I'd consider that mostly reasonable, but like....

Unless you have other reason to suspect something, what you did was a huge overreaction", "YTA. It was an overreaction and your response was an inappropriate way to express your discomfort.  He didn\u2019t say anything to suggest anything inappropriate on his end.  And if his saying that made you uncomfortable, and you don\u2019t feel you can control that response, the mature way to deal with it would have been to tell him later, when you were alone, that even though you understand why he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, his talking about another woman\u2019s body like that was jarring to you, and to ask him politely to try to avoid comments like that to the extent he can.", "yta\n\ni know its not entirely in your control but come on. you should have relaxed after he explained it to him. you act as if his tattooist threw herself at him and tried to smother him with her boobs. thats not what happened. at all.\n\nits fine to feel jealous but you acted way over the top. too dramatic. your boyfriend did nothing wrong and its a you-issue.", "YTA. Your feelings matter, your mental disorder is a struggle to have to live with, but your reaction and seemingly continued determination that he was in the wrong are both off the mark. The thing that pushes it to yta the most for me is that, when they didn\u2019t notice your silence, you started to sniffle. That implies to me that you were looking for attention. Maybe you meant that them not noticing made you upset enough to start crying, but either way, they did nothing wrong. You need to learn coping mechanisms that don\u2019t put ALL the pressure on your loved ones to recognize and regulate your emotions. I hope you\u2019re able to talk things out and figure where to go from here.", "YTA. Aside from your manipulative behavior, your BF did nothing wrong. He didn't seek out a sexual situation with another woman, he did nothing sexual to her, he wasn't unfaithful, he just commented on a thing that happened.  Is he supposed to be forbidden from experiencing any positive emotion that is not caused by you?", "I have BPD an I can understand having difficulty regulating your emotions, especially when it comes to jealousy. That being said, you need to have the self awareness to be able to step back and realize when you\u2019re being unreasonable. You should consider apologizing to your boyfriend and your friend because in the situation YTA.", "YTA. And this isn\u2019t how you express your emotions. You used manipulative behavior twice to express yourself. First you gave him the silent treatment (manipulative) and then you fake cried (manipulative). You need professional help and DBT", "YTA don\u2019t use your BPD as an excuse to act like this. i have it too.", "YTA. I have BPD and it\u2019s not an excuse to be rude to your bf because you were jealous.", "YTA and clearly you don't have a good enough handle on your BPD to be in a healthy relationship. I have BPD and I know relationships can be difficult to navigate but your behavior was entirely uncalled for. No idea how this man has put up with this for 3 years if you're normally like this", "soft YTA because I feel like this this is your illness talking.  What he said was literally a statement of fact. Her boobs pressed up against him. End of story.", "YTA. You've gotten to the point where you've admitted that you were jealous, that your reaction was rooted in jealousy, now you have to take the next steps to acknowledge that your jealousy is not his responsibility. While your MH issues could certainly be the reason for this type of behavior, they aren't an excuse and that's something you're going to have to do work on as someone living with mental illness. You might consider talking to a MH professional to figure out what tools you can cultivate to deal with these types of emotional reactions in a healthy, productive way.", "\"so I started sniffing a bit and he asked what was wrong.\"\n\nThis is why I feel like YTA. I have BPD and Bipolar2. This is straight up passive aggressive, conscious manipulation. I'm not saying your feelings aren't valid but even with MH issues there is a better way to handle it. MH already has such a negative stigma...", "YTA in this situation. i\u2019m diagnosed BPD and i\u2019ve found myself feeling overwhelmed with insecurity by comments made by my partner or even friends. but BPD isn\u2019t an excuse to stonewall someone because you made an assumption about their thoughts. i understand it\u2019s hard, but it sounds like you\u2019re quite aware of how your maladaptive behaviour manifests. even if you weren\u2019t, it\u2019s your responsibility, not your partner\u2019s, yours. your reaction in this situation is very immature and you need to learn to communicate more effectively with those around you and yourself! i highly recommend seeking therapy. i\u2019ve seen many and had the best experience with a psychotherapist. i want to make it clear i\u2019m not trying to make you feel bad, but it helped me a lot to recognize that i still have agency over my thoughts and behaviours in spite of my automatic processes.", "YTA.\n\nDefinitely an over reaction, but hey, that's BPD for ya.", "YTA - just reading everything, you definitely overrated. \nYes you have mental health issues as I'm sure a lot of us do, but please remember that your triggers are your responsibility. People shouldn't have to walk on egg shells.\n\nNo where in here did he say he enjoyed her boobs on him or anything. He could've mentioned it to express how annoying it could've been. Then you stated how you went silent and no one noticed. Well, yes, because no one is a mind reader. \n\nYour boyfriend and friend both deserve an apology. \n\nI would also suggest talking this out next time instead of hiding under the blankets in your room. How can he understand what is going on if you do not effectively communicate with him?

It sounds like your BF was in an awkward situation, could have been really uncomfortable for him and he was just voicing the experience, not reminiscing about another woman\u2019s breasts.", "YTA - Your emotions are valid, and I know you can't help it, but you did overreact. He remembers the tattoo artist because her boobs were pressed up against him. He's not necessarily saying he wants her boobs over yours, but it sticks out in his mind because that's not something that would happen every day. \n\nI know it can be hard to not react in the moment, though. Take some deep breaths and let it go. Forgive yourself and your boyfriend.", "YTA. I understand you may not be able to control all your emotions since you have BPD. However, as someone with very large breasts, it is really out of our control. She is a tattoo artist and depending on the area she is tattooing, her breasts may touch her clients. You did mention they were touching his head, and I\u2019m sure that was not an everyday occurrence for him, hence why he mentioned it. \n\nAlso, if you mention how you find other men attractive to your boyfriend, this small comment he made about a professional going about her job should not be that big of a deal. You should stop making those comments around your partner. \n\nI think it is great you have found a partner who is aware of your BPD and accepts you for who you are. However it seems like you have some personal inner work to do still.", "I feel sorry for your boyfriend. You need more therapy", "Gentle YTA. BPD emotions get routed through the fear of abandonment department, which is uncomfortable to feel. But he commented on a fact about a situation. It was not a loaded statement. It is, in fact, something that is almost impossible not to notice.

The mature thing to do would be to voice your feelings, possibly waiting until you 2 were alone since it may be weird to have that conversation in front of a friend.\n\nI think he needs to understand that his comment hurt you, intentionally or not.

I can empathize with mental health issues, but that doesn't give you a pass for manipulative behavior.\n\nIt's an insensitive comment for your BF to make, and you're not wrong for telling him that or how it made you feel. But you can do that in a much better way. I know that BPD makes it likely to feel everything in a more intense way, but taking a time out and employing some CBT strategies for distorted thoughts would have been the way to go here. If you were still upset, then you can pull him aside or deal with it after your friend left. A \"dude, seriously, I don't wanna hear that.\" type comment also would have been fine in the moment, but with other people around, making it a big deal should be avoided.\n\nAlso, if you both have a history of discussing other people you find attractive, (totally normal), you can't have a double standard about that. Either that type of discussion is off the table for both of you, or you need to work to manage your jealousy when it comes up. Humans think about sex. You cannot prevent or control your BFs thoughts on the matter. What counts are his actions. You have three years together. An occasional bone head comment is normal, consider his treatment of you over the course of the last three years.\n\nYou ditched your friend and put both your BF and friend in an uncomfortable spot by prioritizing your emotions in the moment.
