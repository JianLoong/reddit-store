When we first started dating and the topic of kids came up, we realized we both liked [particular name]. The name is very sentimental for us and holds a lot of meaning, and we planned to name our first child that. \n\nWhen we were engaged, one of his sisters and brother-in-law announced they were expecting. At this point, my husband and I had briefly mentioned we were using [particular name] when we have children, but hadn\u2019t had a serious conversation with any of his family members. SIL and BIL decide they like the name, and wanted to name their child that. \n\nWe couldn\u2019t \u201cclaim\u201d the name, so my husband and I sat down with them and told them they could go ahead and use the name, but we would also be using it when we have our first child. There was a bit of back and forth and eventually they realized we weren\u2019t budging and agreed. The name has a lot of different nickname variations, so we decided that if anything, we would just use a different nickname than what they would use. Unfortunately, SIL and BIL lost the baby.\n\nFast forward 3.5 years, and we are expecting a baby boy! We are naming him [particular name.]  SIL and BIL are furious and are demanding us to change the babies name. Husband and I reminded them about the conversation we had, and that we have been planning to use [particular name] since we started dating. We would also be using a specific nickname - unsure if they had decided on nickname when they had lost the baby, but did not mention anything. \n\nMost of the family is on our side as we have been saying for 6 years that we are naming our child [particular name.] Some are saying we should change the name for the sake of family. We aren\u2019t particularly close with BIL/SIL and don\u2019t expect them to be involved in the child\u2019s life. \n\nI am torn because the name means _*alot*_ to us. \n\nWIBTA if I name my child the same name as my BIL/SIL child\u2019s name?\n\nEdit 1: SIL/BIL lost their baby around 3/4 month mark. We are not close with them so unsure of specifics, but from some math we did, it seems it was end of first trimester or beginning of second trimester. \n\nEdit 2: We can\u2019t use the name as a middle name. In our culture there is a specific middle name boys get, and a specific middle name girls get. We are going to give Baby [specific middle name], and don\u2019t want to give 2 middle names as Baby will also have 2 last names. That will give Baby 5 names - which we want to avoid as it seems impractical. \n\nEdit 3: Thank you for the input everyone. It is nice to have my feelings validated. I don\u2019t know what we are going to do, but I\u2019ve swallowed almost an entire bottle of Tums and am going to attempt to sleep sitting upright. Thank you again for all ur input.

They lost their baby and gave him this name knowing  that you planned to do so, too. \n\nBut still think about it once again. For your MIL and FIL that is still the name of their dead grandson and for BIL/SIL their childs name. While it wouldn't gave matter for your child to be at family holiday, Thanksgiving, Christmas etc with a cousin with the same name, there will come the day that your son will hear about his dead cousin and I don't know how he would feel about it. Imagine to have the same name as your dead cousin, imagine how you would feel even on that few ocassions when you see your aunt or uncle or even the grandparents sad when hearing your name.  If you don't mind about that or think that doesnt matter, just go ahead with this name", "I don't think you are an asshole but I do think you are a bit insensitive. I mean you might not have been able to have children or you might have only had girls. Why does it matter if your baby has 2 middle names? It's not as if he'd be using them every day. Remind yourself how lucky you are that your pregnancy is going well and be the bigger person. I'm sure if you had your 1st son's name arranged then you had thought about a name for a 2nd one. Call your son something else and keep reminding yourself how lucky you have been_", "NTA but it would be better to not use the name in the spirit of empathy.

I personally would not use it but I won\u2019t judge you if you do, given its meaning for you.", "YTA. Maybe you've never lost anyone close to you so you don't know the wave of hurt that passes over you everytime you hear their name. I have. It's horrible. I wouldn't wish that on anyone, and especially not family. The terms of your \"agreement\" went out the window when that child died.

In our culture there is a specific middle name that men get, and a specific middle name that women get. Baby will be getting [specific middle name]. We could use the name as an additional middle name - but we also don\u2019t want to give the child a very long name since he will already have 2 last names (also a part of our culture).", "So the nicknames are not similar to the name. \n[Particular name] has sentimental meaning to us - the nicknames do not.

We aren\u2019t close with BIL and SIL, we see them a few times a year and don\u2019t expect them to be involved in our children\u2019s lives. \n\nI have always been the bigger person, so we may just be the bigger person and choose a different name. I know it will affect my relationship with SIL/BIL as well and I will be resentful, which is why this sucks. It\u2019s upsetting because everyone knew how much this phrase and name meant to because of the association with my grandma, and if sucks that they used the name anyways and now when tables are turned, we are to be the bigger people. Sigh ..", "They told husbands other sister that they like the name because it has the same amount of letters as both of their names and started with the same letter as BILs name. They don\u2019t speak the other language much, only when communicating with the elders in our family. They didn\u2019t even know what the name meant until I explained why the name was so important to us.", "I know It sounds very dramatic, and almost silly to articulate. But roughly translated to English - the phrase is \u201cthe path is difficult, but my strength is full.\u201d And we are using the word which translates to Strength.", "I can\u2019t. That\u2019s why I made the post Yessica.", "Perhaps they should have thought about that before using someone elses idea", "Ah okay. Personally I don\u2019t think YTA. It\u2019s a crappy situation but it\u2019s a name that means a great deal to you and your husband and you chose it a long time ago. It\u2019s heartbreaking they lost their child, but that isn\u2019t your fault anymore than it is theirs - which is not at all. What I\u2019d personally do in your situation, is use the name as a middle name and choose another name you love but tell no one what it is. However, that\u2019s me. I don\u2019t think YTA at all for wanting to use a name you were always going to use even when they decided to use it also. I can\u2019t fathom their grief, and if you were close with them or expected them to actually be in your child\u2019s life I\u2019d probably say avoid using the name, but you yourself said they won\u2019t be in the baby\u2019s life. Go with your gut on this as whatever any of us say only you know what\u2019s the best choice in this situation.", "Two middle names would have been my next suggestion - my son has two middle names after both his grandfathers - but I can see that would be problematic with two last names too!", "I just never understood naming a child something you aren't going to call them. But you do you!", "I think you will be less resentful of using a different name, than they will be of you using the name of their dead baby. \n\nLike I said, it\u2019s not just about when you will see them. They will hear about your kid all the time through your MIL or Facebook or whatever even if you aren\u2019t close. \n\nIs being the bigger person really that bad? It\u2019s an opportunity to build your character to be an even better person. You are taking on some of the burden of this lost child of your SIL\u2019s, rather than adding to her load, and that would be a very kind thing.", "Well having a child will keep you busy and give you less time to worry about dumb stuff. This whole thing is incredibly childish. Just pick another name.", "We could skip the [specific middle name] but there is also a religious aspect to it. Both my husband and I, along with both our families, have these specific middle names so it wouldn\u2019t feel right not giving it to Baby. I just don\u2019t want him to have 5 names, I feel like that wouldn\u2019t be practical.", "We definitely originally back in the day, wanted to call him [particular name], but it is a long name \u2026 Let\u2019s say his name is Bartholomew - it\u2019s easier to use a nickname such as Bart, Bo, Barry, etc. I have a kind of long name (10 letters), and I went by a nickname all throughout school just because it was easier."]}
