When we first started dating and the topic of kids came up, we realized we both liked [particular name]. The name is very sentimental for us and holds a lot of meaning, and we planned to name our first child that. \n\nWhen we were engaged, one of his sisters and brother-in-law announced they were expecting. At this point, my husband and I had briefly mentioned we were using [particular name] when we have children, but hadn\u2019t had a serious conversation with any of his family members. SIL and BIL decide they like the name, and wanted to name their child that. \n\nWe couldn\u2019t \u201cclaim\u201d the name, so my husband and I sat down with them and told them they could go ahead and use the name, but we would also be using it when we have our first child. There was a bit of back and forth and eventually they realized we weren\u2019t budging and agreed. The name has a lot of different nickname variations, so we decided that if anything, we would just use a different nickname than what they would use. Unfortunately, SIL and BIL lost the baby.\n\nFast forward 3.5 years, and we are expecting a baby boy! We are naming him [particular name.]  SIL and BIL are furious and are demanding us to change the babies name. Husband and I reminded them about the conversation we had, and that we have been planning to use [particular name] since we started dating. We would also be using a specific nickname - unsure if they had decided on nickname when they had lost the baby, but did not mention anything. \n\nMost of the family is on our side as we have been saying for 6 years that we are naming our child [particular name.] Some are saying we should change the name for the sake of family. We aren\u2019t particularly close with BIL/SIL and don\u2019t expect them to be involved in the child\u2019s life. \n\nI am torn because the name means _*alot*_ to us. \n\nWIBTA if I name my child the same name as my BIL/SIL child\u2019s name?\n\nEdit 1: SIL/BIL lost their pregnancy around 3/4 month mark. We are not close with them so unsure of specifics, but from some math we did, it seems it was end of first trimester or beginning of second trimester. \n\nEdit 2: We can\u2019t use the name as a middle name. In our culture there is a specific middle name boys get, and a specific middle name girls get. We are going to give Baby [specific middle name], and don\u2019t want to give 2 middle names as Baby will also have 2 last names. That will give Baby 5 names - which we want to avoid as it seems impractical. \n\nEdit 3: Thank you for the input everyone. It is nice to have my feelings validated. I don\u2019t know what we are going to do, but I\u2019ve swallowed almost an entire bottle of Tums and am going to attempt to sleep sitting upright. Thank you again for all ur input.

They lost their baby and gave him this name knowing  that you planned to do so, too. \n\nBut still think about it once again. For your MIL and FIL that is still the name of their dead grandson and for BIL/SIL their childs name. While it wouldn't gave matter for your child to be at family holiday, Thanksgiving, Christmas etc with a cousin with the same name, there will come the day that your son will hear about his dead cousin and I don't know how he would feel about it. Imagine to have the same name as your dead cousin, imagine how you would feel even on that few ocassions when you see your aunt or uncle or even the grandparents sad when hearing your name.  If you don't mind about that or think that doesnt matter, just go ahead with this name", "I don't think you are an asshole but I do think you are a bit insensitive. I mean you might not have been able to have children or you might have only had girls. Why does it matter if your baby has 2 middle names? It's not as if he'd be using them every day. Remind yourself how lucky you are that your pregnancy is going well and be the bigger person. I'm sure if you had your 1st son's name arranged then you had thought about a name for a 2nd one. Call your son something else and keep reminding yourself how lucky you have been_", "NTA but it would be better to not use the name in the spirit of empathy.

I personally would not use it but I won\u2019t judge you if you do, given its meaning for you.", "YTA. Maybe you've never lost anyone close to you so you don't know the wave of hurt that passes over you everytime you hear their name. I have. It's horrible. I wouldn't wish that on anyone, and especially not family. The terms of your \"agreement\" went out the window when that child died.

This was something his and my entire family knew of because we use the phrase (which the name is derived from) in our daily lives and naturally conversations came up about marriage, children, etc. \n\nWhen SIL/BIL decided they suddenly liked the name (at this point it had been 3ish years since we\u2019ve been saying we like [particular name]) we told them that\u2019s fine, but we will still use the name.

If both babies had lived, they could have each had the name and been happy with that, but if one baby dies, it would definitely be a sad reminder for their parents to see a niece or nephew with the same name that they picked for their own child, so in that case, I could see recommending to use a different name for empathy\u2019s sake. \n\nHowever, in this case, the parents only chose the name BECAUSE they heard the other parents\u2019 intentions, and they willingly took the name knowing it had already been chosen for their baby\u2019s cousin. Then, the other parents made it specifically clear that they would not be changing their minds on using the name, and yet the name thieves used the name anyways. They were perfectly well informed enough to avoid this situation - they don\u2019t get to paint themselves the victims when they caused this situation to begin with.", "Lesson learned for sure \ud83e\udee0", "Being actively kind would have been the sil not stealing a name for a baby who wasn't born", "Are you the sil?", "For some context - no one in their family associates the name with SIL/BIL. They are not close with the family, and everyone from the immediate family (other siblings, parents, close cousins) are on our side. If husbands other siblings or parents weren\u2019t supportive of this, we would have considered another name. \n\nWe are from a culture where shared names are common. My husband has 2 other cousins who have the same name as him, we are from a culture where all names are gender neutral, so there is always \u201cduplicates\u201d. \n\nOur (or my) big concern is my in laws relationship with sister. They have a very strained relationship already, and sister is not happy that in laws are on our side. My concern is that this will further deteriorate _their_ relationship. Husband does not care as much since he doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with sister (he was adopted, and she was very cruel to him growing up), but I don\u2019t to be \u201cresponsible\u201d for a further falling out between them.", "I haven\u2019t 100% made up my mind, but it is definitely what I\u2019m leaning towards.

That is another reason we like the name, we plan to stay in this area for the foreseeable future, and the name has a lot of nicknames that are traditionally \u201cwhite\u201d names. We want to give our child a traditional name, but want to minimize any bullying or racism they might face. \n\nIt is tricky. In laws are on our side - sister has burned a lot of bridges with family due to her behaviour and antics so luckily everyone understands and is supportive. Sister also doesn\u2019t like me, and has made that very clear so I feel like a lot of this is just to spite me. I\u2019m very close to my husbands family and parents and she\u2019s made snide comments over the years about how my husband isn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d their child and I\u2019m not \u201creally\u201d their DIL. Years ago when we got married, she even threatened to cut contact with her parents if they helped us pay for the wedding (which they did do - as they did for all their other children). For her second child (baby after miscarriage), SIL and I even threw her a \u201cRainbow Party\u201d to celebrate and she thanked and gushed  to SIL and didn\u2019t even acknowledge my part in it. She just doesn\u2019t like me or my husband. \n\nThat would be good idea but not feasible. My husband was adopted as a very young child, his bio parents are back in India and his biological mother is his adopted father\u2019s sister. When he was adopted, they changed his last name to what adopted families lastname is. When we got married, we took both last names (his bio lastname, and adopted last name) so it would be an extremely long name if we did: New name [Particular name as middle name 1] [Singh as middle name 2] [Last name 1] [Last name 2]. \n\nI feel like either way, I\u2019m just losing hin this situation.", "Because of what?  \ud83e\udd14\n\nIf you tell no one, it\u2019s quite unlikely someone gatekeeps your childs name?", "So what?

It sucks that it came to pass but they must have known it might.", "You're NTA and they took the name from you first. Additionally, they never had the baby, so as cruel as it sounds, they had no baby to name. Sorry, but that's just the truth. Miscarriages are extremely common and I have had two.

Congratulations! \ud83d\ude01", "Thise blood tests arent 100% accurate though", "That's understandable but then they shouldn't have stolen the name they knew someone else was going to use, especially to name a pre-viability pregnancy. Odds of miscarriage are still extremely high at that point so it was a very real possibility that they absolutely were or should have been aware of. Sucks but that's yet another reason why you shouldn't poach a name that you know is going to be used or has already been used in the family. \n\nWhat if they named the kid after an uncle and then it died?
