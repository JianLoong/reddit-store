I'm guessing they are not. Fair rent would probably be more than the taxes, so I think they owe you money instead of the other way around!\n\nHonestly, inheriting a fraction of a house is a real mess. You need to negotiate with them about what would be fair. The best thing might be for them to buy out your share. In some places, if they can't afford to do that, then you could push for the **property to be sold** so that the money can be evenly distributed. I suspect they would hate that, so the threat of it might be enough to get them to negotiate more reasonably.", "Dear ~~Freeloaders~~ Family, \n\nThere are 3 options in our situation. \n\n1. We rent the house, either to you or to new tenants when you leave, and I pay my share of the taxes from that money.  \n\n2. We hire an appraiser, determine the value of the house, and you can all either buy me out or I can legally force the sale and we split the proceeds.  \n\n3. You keep living there rent free for now and you don't bother me to supplement your living situation as I could be getting much more than the zero dollars I currently am from the house. \n\nHowever, OP, I would not pick #3, as in many places, if they live there long enough and pay the taxes, you could lose your claim to ownership, or at least make that claim very expensive to defend in court.  \n\nNTA", "So for their inheritance they get to live in a free house, and your inheritance is a bill?

Some of the responses above sound better about them paying you 1/4 rent if you\u2019re going to pay 1/4 taxes. I think id just want one of them to buy me out of the house.", "I mean... kinda yta.\n\nLike, I see where you're coming from. But, inherited or otherwise, you own a part of the property, and it's the responsibility of the owner(s) to pay the property tax. If you don't want that, then ask the other owners to buy you out.\n\nAlternatively, you could ask one of the non-owner residents (if there is one, I'm kind of confused to who is living in the house vs who owns it) to pay your portion of the tax in lieu of rent.", "YTA **Youre the owner, owners pay property taxes.**\n\nIt\u2019s your responsibility to pay the property tax as the owner of the property.\n\nIf they were asking for utilities, that would make them the assholes, but paying property taxes on property you own, is ownership 101.\n\n**Force them to buy you out or pay up.**", "YTA - you own 1/4 of this property. You owe 1/4 of the taxes.\n\nIf you don't want to pay the taxes then you sell them your 1/4 of the property and walk away.", "YTA  As an owner you are obligated to pay taxes.\n\nThe only real way out of this is to talk to a lawyer and appraiser and have them buy you out. Otherwise you are stuck with this headache.", "YTA for not paying 1/4 of the property you own, whether you live there or not, you still own 1/4 of the property. Now because you don't live there you can ask for a 1/4 of the \"rent\" that the place would be making and that could be enough to pay your share of the property tax. You could also say you won't charge any rent if they pay your share of the property tax. Ask them to buy you out, but you could lose money because property values will still go up over time. Make sure you get it legally written so that they can't latter say you gave them your share and they can show you never paid any of the taxes on the property.", "YTA. \n\nProperty is an investment, not just housing. Paying taxes is part of that investment. If you don't want to pay taxes then sell your share. \n\nI think you're justified in *asking* that the residents pay all taxes, on the same way you'd be justified in asking for rent from them. Neither are required, but it may make some sense.", "YTA.  You own 1/4 of the house, you owe 1/4 of the taxes.", "NTA but - This won\u2019t be popular, but legally if you owe 1/4th, and are on the deed you are liable for the tax.   Is your intent to take part in the gains when it sells?  If so you should help with the tax.  Separately, if they live there they should be paying you rent.  Splitting assets like this always causes trouble unless it\u2019s treated 100% as a business transaction (sell it or rent it out) vs a personal transaction (live on premises etc)", "NTA.

There\u2019s 3 people who lived there 2 of them are my aunts and the other is an uncle. The two aunts own 1/4 each, but the uncle doesn\u2019t own anything. Nobody pays rent. \n\nIf it were just up to me I\u2019d sell, but since they obviously don\u2019t want to.

So together, they control 2/4 of the property. Also, the uncle who lives there is the father of the cousin (and the spouse of the aunt). So I\u2019m not sure what her thoughts are, but most likely her share of the taxes is being covered by the uncle or aunt or both. He may also be covering other expenses, im not sure", "So most likely, the cousin will take the side of the aunt as it\u2019s her daughter and he costs are probably being covered by the uncle who isn\u2019t an owner and is living there rent free (but this is speculation)", "I would definitely be open to them buying me out, so I can offer that.

Is that unfair?", "If you don't want to start a big fight, here's something you might propose: \"I won't charge you guys rent, but in return, you are responsible for taxes and and repairs.\" I actually think that's more than fair. After all, when landlords rent a house, their goal is to make a profit even after covering taxes and repairs, so that same math should apply here. \n\nIn a sense, they actually did you a favor by requesting this, because the sooner you negotiate the details the better. \n\nGiven the situation, it does seem kind of mean to push them out of their house. I mean, it sounds like this has been a long-term family home.", "Calculate fair rent for the house, and then divide it by 4 since you own 1/4 of the house. That\u2019s what they should owe you every month. But then you would be responsible for 1/4 of all the repairs and upkeep costs as 1/4 of the landlord. \n\n\nGo show them that number and inform that you\u2019re willing to take nothing in exchange for upkeep and tax costs until they sell the house and you get your 1/4. \n\n\nIt is fair that you would be responsible for 1/4 of the tax bill imo, but you\u2019re also entitled to get something out of the house. So it has to work both ways. This is where you\u2019ll have to negotiate an agreement with them. Personally I would push for the \u201cbuy me out\u201d option and take the cash and go on with your life.", "INFO: what does your cousin think? they also own 1/4 of the property.", "If you want to sell then get the house properly appraised and make them buy you out of your portion of it.   Then they can own it themselves and deal with every thing on their own.", "Yeah, you would. You don't get to just say \"no I don't want to pay my taxes\", even if the property is inherited.\n\nIf works the same as where I am (not the US) you'll be reimbursed for the \"unused\" property tax. I don't know what else to call it, but basically if you pay for the full year in January and sell in March, then you'll get 9 months worth of that tax back as a part of the sale.\n\nTalk to a real-estate lawyer regardless. They can walk you through your options including the process of a buy-out or a forced sale. I personally wouldn't fuck around with property ownership without a lawyer.", "Yes, if you do not pay your portion of the property taxes, there's always the chance that they could use this to take away or reduce your claim to the property. Paying property taxes will help assert your claim to any proceeds when and if they sell at some point.\n\nYou very much need to talk to a property lawyer.", "You can likely force a sale and probably should if this is the attitude.", "Yes. Because you are still entitled to 25% of the sales of the property whenever it is sold.\n\nYou can force a sale, but you aren\u2019t going to learn how to do that on AITA. Get in touch with an estate attorney, a property attorney, or possibly a probate attorney. Paying the taxes is probably cheaper though.\n\nEdit: if you don\u2019t want to pay property taxes now, you can have a lawyer draw up a contract stating you will not pay property tax but that those taxes will be removed from your 25% of the sale of the home when it is sold. All parties must agree to this and sign though.", "Yes. I'm sorry but if you own property it's your responsibility to pay the taxes on it. It's adult life. \n\nNow you can go back and ask for rent from the people who are not owners but seeing as you're only 1/4 owner and the others are living there I doubt you'll get it.", "YTA for wanting to get out of paying taxes in property that you own. Just because you don't live there doesn't mean you don't own it and aren't responsible for it. That's the shitty part of inheriting property. Whether you want it or not it's yours. \n\nBottom line is that if you don't want to pay your share of the taxes is that you have to remove yourself from the property. If you sign away all your rights to it, then you won't have to pay taxes, but when the time comes to sell, you get no proceeds either. Do you want anything out of it or do you just want out all together? Those are your only options to get out of paying your property taxes. And yes, you can force it. It's all a question of what you want and your relationship with those family members.", "They want to continue to live there, I\u2019d rather just sell or be bought out. If they don\u2019t want to sell or buy me out I\u2019d at least think it\u2019s fair they cover the costs of the property. Am I wrong?", "So I\u2019m not the asshole if I force them to sell?", "I\u2019m pretty sure they want to continue living there. My ideal situation would be to sell or be bought out. If they don\u2019t want to sell or buy me out then am I wrong to ask them to cover the costs including my taxes?", "I\u2019m open to being bought out, but I think they\u2019d rather live there and just have me pay 1/4 of the taxes. I\u2019d rather sell or be bought out", "You can't just decide you don't want the property.", "I think thats reasonable and fair. But you *still* need to get a lawyer involved to have a contract written up and notarized so you don't get screwed down the line by not paying your legal portion of the taxes.\n\nAt this point, it's way beyond Reddit's paygrade.\n\nYTA for the original post question. Talk to a lawyer.", "I don\u2019t know. What are their circumstances? Will they be homeless? Unable to receive medical treatment, etc, as a result of being forced to move? Can they find other/similar homes for about the same price?\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to pay taxes now, consider getting a lawyer and having a contract drawn up stating that you won\u2019t pay taxes now but that your share of the taxes will be repaid to them upon the sale of the home. \n\nIf you plan to get money for the housing sale, be it now or in the future, and you don\u2019t pay your share of taxes, you\u2019re an asshole.", "You can go to a lawyer and set up the paperwork to transfer full ownership to one of the people in the house. Poof. No more ownership, no more taxes.", "Without their agreement?\n\n\nThe whole point is that they want to keep living there with OP paying some of their way. \n\n\nAnd OP shouldn't just give it away. They are right, they should talk to a lawyer to either force a sale or get \"rent,\" which could be 1/4 the price of the taxes."]}
