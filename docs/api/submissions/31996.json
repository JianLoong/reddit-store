We are both equally responsive for taxes, insurance repairs etc. For you to live in that house by yourself, I want $1000/month in rent, half the market cost. \n\nYou can say no, and then I force a sale and we can each buy a house half that cost, you get to live in a much smaller house and I still get to rent out a house for $1000/month. \n\nIf you are monopolizing the home, then you can either appropriately compensate the other owner(s) or we can sell the asset and buy our own lesser value assets with our appropriate shares.\n\nIn no way, am I paying for expenses on that home as charity for you, and I have no obligation to live in a house I own. \n\nThe OP is entitled to fair compensation or fair use and he is declining fair use. If they don't want to pay rent for his proportionate share, then they can come to another agreement (such as they pay taxes and expenses in lieu of) or he can force a sale and they have to move out anyways.", "Your whole question is aitah if I feel they should pay all of the property tax. Eventually you are either going to have to tell them that which legally you can\u2019t enforce or tell them you want to sell your portion. So either way you\u2019re going to upset them. But going down one route gives you no legal leg to stand in where the other one does. So my confusion was why aren\u2019t you just bypassing the taxes conversation altogether and just telling them you want nothing to do with the property?", "Agreed - they need to buy OP out.", "He can (maybe) force a sale. That has nothing to do with rent. He is, under no law in the US, entitled to rent.", "Because they may not have the means to purchase my share of the property. So it\u2019s in their best interest if I pay 1/4 of the taxes and they continue to live rent free on the property which isn\u2019t on my best interest.\n\nBut I could force the sale for all of us of the property which would be in my best interest but not theirs. \n\nSo a compromise is they pay my share of the taxes and continue to use the property as they please until everyone is ready to sell.", "There is no US law entitling anybody to rent. And I never said he was \"entitled\" to rent. I said \"he can absolutely ask for rent\". Contract law would govern any rent entitlement and the agreement would be a contract.\n\nIf no agreement can be reached, then the next step would be to force a sale. In most cases of residential home ownership in the U.S., a sale or partition action can be forced by any co-owner.\n\nAs far as the property taxes go, as far as U.S. law is concerned, all property owners are responsible for the the full amount and Uncle Sam doesn't give a damn how it is split up. There is no legal requirement that two owners have to split the taxes equally. If parties don't agree, force a sale. \n\n\n\nAnecdotally, I own a home with my wife and separately, my wife owns another inherited family residence with her parents. Prior to marriage, my wife lived by herself at this residence and covered all the expenses. When we moved to our current home, her parents wanted to keep the status quo and wanted her to continue to pay all the expenses on that residence. We gave them options and we personally did not want to handle any landlord responsibilities in addition to our new home.\n\n1.) We can split expenses 50/50 and it remains vacant.\n2.) We can sell the property and nobody has to pay expenses.\n3.) They can rent it out, keep all profits, but are responsible for managing the tenant, repairs, and duties as a landlord, while wife will agree to sign off as allowing a tenant\n\n\nThose were the options and they picked option 3. The property stays in the family, and neither side is out money. Parents have extra responsibilities and they also get to profit on the home. We weren't \"entitled\" to that option, but we asked for it and we were more than ready to force a sale so we weren't pouring the full cost of taxes,insuarance, and repairs on a property we didn't necessarily want to maintain ownership on.", "Also, let\u2019s say he somehow convinces them to agree to rent. He\u2019s not responsible for repairs and maintenance which he wasn\u2019t to before. He\u2019s also outvoted 3-1 if repairs are deemed necessary.\n\nSeems like a risky hill to die on to me."]}
