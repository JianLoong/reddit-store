My first pregnancy was a breeze, I could do anything til birth. My second my consultant wanted to admit me to hospital at 7.5 months and only agreed to not admitting me if I swore to take it easy.

I was so sick for my entire second pregnancy that all I could stomach was saltines and ginger ale for most of it. Zofran did nothing.

I remember I got so excited one time because I was able to eat 2 slices of pizza\u2026 then on the last bite my body turned on me and I\u2019ve never been so sad. \n\nPhysically I was okay other than aches and pains (I have joint hyper mobility so I\u2019m used to that though) but I couldn\u2019t step foot in kitchen if there was dirty dishes or deal with any kind of gross things. We used disposable everything during that time. I got disposable pans and only made pasta in pots that needed to be cleaned. The tiniest triggers would have me throwing up. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t even know a thing would make me sick until it was too late. \n\nMy husband and I have talked about having a baby but it terrifies me after the last one\u2026 and it was almost 11 years ago.", "The picture this created in my mind... \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yes, I meant to back you up and give an example of how even when there are some complications, most still allow you to do some of the stuff.
