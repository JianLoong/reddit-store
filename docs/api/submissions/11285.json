She could at least walk her son through cleaning it up himself, which would be beneficial to her too as I assume he\u2019s the same at home", "And you, as the parent, made that call. OP\u2019s sister reluctantly cleaned the bathroom (after asking OP to clean it instead). At no point did the sister tell her kid to clean it up. \n\nAll OP wanted was a clean bathroom and not to clean it herself, going out on a limb and saying she didn\u2019t care which of those two cleaned it.", "Agreed, I\u2019ve had my 5 year old clean up after herself when she leaves the toilet a mess, and she can do it with minimal help now (I started around when she was 4 and a half because she\u2019s got a problem flushing \ud83d\ude05). A 7 year old should definitely be able to do it.", "I make my 4 yo come back into the bathroom and wipe up his pee if he pees all over the place. Of course I clean it better when he leaves but I want it instilled in him so things like this don\u2019t happen!", "Right! If OP had made the 8 yr old come clean it up the AITA post would be related to THAT incident. NTA for taking it to the sister; her child, her mess to clean!", "True", "Exactly. It\u2019s really not OP\u2019s place to discipline her nephew.", "That\u2019s why I said ESH.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with asking for help. Like I said, I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s an asshole here.", "Everyone\u2019s pregnancy is different though, I\u2019m currently 20 weeks with my third and each pregnancy has been harder on me and I\u2019ve been able to do less. If I clean the bathroom I basically can\u2019t do anything else that day \ud83d\ude05", "Or the mother calls her sister to come over and clean it up.", "If she was so incapacitated that she cannot clean up after her kids, or be stern enough to have the kid do it, then she shouldn't be taking her kids to other peoples house. Regardless of how you slice it the pregnant woman is the asshole here not OP. Not like she's expected to lift the toilet up to clean it.", "I bet her house smells like child piss", "Being pregnant does not always make you infirm. Sorry you had a tough go of it but I worked right to the end in a fairly physical job. Cleaning a toilet and floor at 7 months isn\u2019t the big deal you\u2019re making it out to be.", "So how is OP the AH for saying \u201cI\u2019m not cleaning that up, you deal with it\u201d to her sister? Sister chose not to make her kid clean it up but it should have never been on OP.", "Sure, it\u2019s fine to ask for help. Is it ok to tell someone to F off if they don\u2019t provide the help you asked for?", "I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s incapacitated. I\u2019m saying that some women have a hard time bending over at 7(!!!) months pregnant and some people are Rihanna. Most of us couldn\u2019t pull off a halftime show while not pregnant at all.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly something wrong with the kid\u2019s behavior, but it\u2019s unreasonable to suggest that pregnant women with existing kids and physical limitations shouldn\u2019t be able to go to a family member\u2019s house. She\u2019s not on house arrest.", "OP could\u2019ve asked nephew to do it. She\u2019s got a mouth and can talk.", "Well with a son like hers I would say she is on house arrest.\n\nEither she cleans up after him, or she stays home with a child that seems to have been raised in the wild.\n\nSHe's pregnant not on bed rest. Not on FB house arrest either as you mentioned, and so as far as I'm concerned she's manipulating the situation.", "> I\u2019m saying that some women have a hard time bending over at 7(!!!) months pregnant\n\nThat's [incapacitated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/incapacitated)! If you cannot bend over, then by definition you are prevented from functioning in a normal way. It is normal to be able to bend over. Nothing wrong with being incapacitated in some way, it's okay. But you have to have personal responsibility to recognize that and behave appropriately. \n\n> but it\u2019s unreasonable to suggest that pregnant women with existing kids and physical limitations shouldn\u2019t be able to go to a family member\u2019s house. \n\nIf you can't control your kids and clean up after them then you're not welcome at my house. Family or not, I'm not cleaning up after your kids and if you cannot then neither of you are welcome until one of you can. I don't see what's unreasonable about expecting a visitor to respect me and my home."]}
