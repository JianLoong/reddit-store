Your 4 year old grandkids will be none the wiser who got them any of the masses of gifts for the holidays.

And if he does that, that's a him issue.\n\nI'm getting a sniff of \"They always came here before and don't like that they are going to DIL's family instead.\" Only you know whether that sentiment (hurt, maybe?) is part of the reason driving you to not get gifts for your grandkids. \n\nFighting over which extended family to spend holidays with is so common in nuclear families. Feisty, unnecessary stress at a time of year that is supposed to be happy. At the end of it, Christmas is just a day. Whether it is Dec 25, or you see them on Dec 26,  28, 30, January...  Unsolicited two cents: You are not part of your son's nuclear family right now, like it or lump it. But if you're trying to make a passive aggressive dig at him with this present thing in response to not winning the 'grandmas house for Christmas' battle, you're only causing more stress on him/ his family ... For no potential benefit. You didn't say as much, and not to be accusatory... Most grandparents do but their grandkids Christmas gifts though, just 'because'. You aren't TA for not doing it and they probably won't even notice... But your motives for not doing it might make you an AH, depending on what those motives are.", "ESH.

You son is married and he has another family to consider also.\n\nNot getting gifts for HIM is entirely appropriate since he won't be at your house. But deciding that you're not getting gifts for your grandkids (who are old enough to enjoy and appreciate gifts) seems like cutting off your nose to spite your face. I assume you love your grandkids and want to be a part of their life. Why not buy them gifts and give them to them another time around the Christmas season? Or, if they live far away, send them gifts in the mail and arrange to facetime them so you can see them open the gifts.\n\nYour grandkids should be important enough to put this slight (aka bad behavior on your son's part) aside for their sake alone.", "I don\u2019t really see the connection between your son buying gifts for other people and YOU buying gifts for your grandkids.

Is that it? That\u2019s mean and cheap.", "Yes. YTA \n\nThese are your 4yo grandchildren. Not sending the grandchildren a Christmas gift is kind of heartless. It's seems like a vengeful action and a punishment for not spending Christmas with you.", "ESH \n\nLook at least buy your grandkids token gifts every year so they know they are thought of. Absolutely skip buying your son a gift but the twins should get something. Heck buy them each a $ store Christmas ornament and a candy cane plus a card but get them something,", "YTA \u2014 as both a parent and someone who has parents I feel like I\u2019m taking crazy pills with these responses. My parents would never not get their own grandkids a once a year special present just because they won\u2019t see them for the holiday. Sometimes they do and in fact often they don\u2019t. If not they go on Amazon and click deliver to X address  and problem solved. The kids open up the gifts, we take a little video to show them opening it up and playing then call grandparents to say thank you. \nLike millions of people do!\n\nYour entire family seems to be tit for tat but you seem to be driving the bus here. I also wouldn\u2019t expect to have to buy presents for nieces and nephews in order for my kids to get a gift from their own grandparents. These are not the same relationships at all. And they don\u2019t be at the event so you can\u2019t argue anyone could feel left out at a gift exchange. That would only make sense if the parents of the other grandkids  got presents for the twins and your son didn\u2019t reciprocate. But again\u2014 totally independent of your relationship.\n\nThe other way to look at it is you will give some grandkids a present because you will see them that day, and others will be penalized for the crime of\u2026 having another set of grandparents.\n\nMaybe your sons attitude threw you off. I\u2019m guessing your attitude threw him off too.

They are the product of all of your hard work of parenting your children. You are to teach them, the things their parents can\u2019t.

If you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t get to see them next Christmas either.", "NTA", "ESH, I think. \n\nI find this situation a little bizarre. It made sense not to buy your grandkids gifts at the time, they were likely too young to care. It is strange you don\u2019t want to get them gifts now that they are old enough to enjoy them and associate who gave them. \n\nIt makes sense to me that the adults wouldn\u2019t exchange gifts with each other if not present today. It just kinda seems like you don\u2019t want to give gifts to your grandkids because your son is spending Xmas with his in laws and isn\u2019t getting you anything. \n\nI do find it egregious for your son to say you must get the kids gifts. He should get something \u201cfrom you\u201d, slap your name on it and inform you. Easy peasy.

But know what? They\u2019ll still get gifts from all of them. Because their grandparents don\u2019t only love them if they\u2019re physically where the grandparents want them to be on a specific day. The kids don\u2019t exactly get to choose where they are anyway. YTA.", "NTA.  Your family should have some ground rules about gift giving though. Most families that I know have an approximate value range. There should be a plan for who's buying for who. \n\nI'd ask him why he thinks you need to buy gifts for people that you won't see on the holiday while he isn't planning to. Has he made an agreement with his siblings to only exchange gifts when they are together ?\n\nThat was never my style of holiday gift giving.  I can imagine not having/sending gifts for my kids and grandkids whether I'm seeing them on the 25th or not. Same as their birthdays.\n\nThere are times in all family traditions when things do shift. As one generation starts moving or marrying/partnering off and starts making the next generation, gift giving practices often shift. By the time I had a few nieces and nephews, my siblings and I stopped buying for each other and got gifts for the kids instead. That was after a few years of buying for new partners too, then shifting to drawing a name out of a hat. Traditions do change and not all families do the same thing, but I  personally don't know anyone who only buys for guests who will be present. \n\nThe important thing is for all the gift givers to be be in agreement or have an understanding to what the plan is.", "YTA.  Are you planning on never seeing your grandkids again?  Because otherwise, you can just give them their Christmas gifts whenever you do see them.  If it\u2019s early, then they are a fun treat.  If it\u2019s late, they are bonus gifts!  My family has celebrated Christmas as late as February when one member was at a work site for months.  We just had a second Christmas feast and gift giving just for them.\n\nGifts aren\u2019t transactional. You can give them Christmas gifts because you want them to have a Christmas gift from you, even when they don\u2019t buy you one back. Also, shopping for preschoolers is a blast and you will never have a chance to give them four year old Christmas gifts again.", "NTA- Sorry to say this but one of 2 things is happening. Either he is going to pass off your and your families gifts as from him/wife/etc. or they will return the gifts for the money. (This has happened in my family, and they would return the gifts and buy cheap crap from the dollar store and spend the money left on themselves or just return them and get nothing. Then when you talked to the kids about how they liked XYZ they were clueless). could be wrong and maybe they just think its fair for you to get each grandkid a gift. (which is fair) but money is tight for everyone right now and I also see not getting gifts if you aren't going to see them. My grandma would sometimes save birthday and Christmas and do one larger thing as she wanted to see them get the gift. (for far away family). The fact that he is refusing to buy gifts for nieces and nephews makes me think he is low on money and hoping to supplement what they buy with others. If you think he might be doing as I mentioned above (return gifts for cash) you should always mark through the barcode scan on toys and packages, put a sharpie mark through the tag on clothes or cut out the tags. Most stores will not take those back as it is a trick thats done by alot of CPS to signal that those items were donated.", "I get it- your son is being cheap. However, this question is should you be punishing your grandkids for the fact that their dad is a cheapskate.\n\nThat doesn't mean that you buy them expensive toys if that's the only thing on their list. And that maybe you get the kids more presents when they're at your place and less when they're someplace else for the holidays. I'm okay with that.\n\nBut I do think you should still get them a thing. Because yeah, they're 4- they'll have no clue. But it's a good habit to get into because at 10, 12, 15- they won't understand why you only give them christmas presents when they're at your place for christmas.\n\nso ESH cuz your son is being an ass but don't punish the grandkids over that.", "Nta he is. He told you that you have to give gift?? He can't tell you how to spend your money.

Money grubbing son!", "My mom has a rule for us kids that if she doesn\u2019t see you on the holidays you get nothing. If he\u2019s not even willing to meet up after the holidays then why buy the gifts? Him expecting you to send them through mail is entitled. Also expecting others to spend money on his kids yet is unwilling to do the same for his own nieces and nephews is absolutely ridiculous.

The son not getting gifts for nephews isn\u2019t the same as a grandparent not getting gifts for grandkids. It\u2019s the son\u2019s kids getting less gifts. OP is still getting gifts for the other grandkids.", "They are supporting 1 child in their selfishness of procuring things for their children while excluding OPs other grandchildren. That is not behavior you reward.", "So you want OP to withhold gifts from certain grandchildren because he doesn\u2019t like the way their father is acting? And you consider this more fair? \n\nGifts are not supposed to be a reward or punishment for your parents\u2019 behavior. It\u2019s supposed to be an act of love and generosity. Although I can see pretty clearly that this family does not count \u201clove and generosity\u201d among their values."]}
