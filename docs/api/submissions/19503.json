Things got very scary this week when he experienced excruciating pain, and an ambulance was called.

He cannot pass anything solid, and due to all the enemas he was given, he is experiencing leakage. When I spoke with the doctor, I also brought this up, and he didn't indicate that there was anything wrong with me doing so.", "I get what you are saying and I would agree that it could be a liability issue but it really depends on your country now and quality of healthcare. I saw my partner go through the public healthcare system in Australia and boy did I have some surprises. When he was admitted to ICU I have nothing but praise for the public healthcare system. He was monitored 24/7 by a dedicated nurse. They had nurses floating around to assist in anything required and several doctors covered the floor and were moments away. We could get an update on his condition and talk to someone about what was happening at any time. \nWhen he was moved to the wards the situation was entirely different. They had one nurse meant to be on call for a room with 8 beds but they were often busy and you waited a long time for anything. He didn't sleep for 2 days because his fluid machine thingy was faulty and kept beeping alarms and it took them that much time to replace it. If he had pooped himself it's easy to imagine he would have waited over an hour for them. The doctors came once a day and often had to wake him at 2am for his daily consult. \nSpending time with him we saw a fair few shift changes and the nurses would be given \"orientation\" because they were temp staff pulled from an agency or another hospital. Even some of the doctors would say they were temp staff too. He even developed swollen elbow and requested an ice pack but couldn't get one all day as a doctor needed to sign off that miraculous medical intervention. After the third shift change of nurses the nurse just brought him one despite waiting for a doctor to approve and told us not to say anything she just couldn't stand to see him wait further for such a small thing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

That is extreme.\n\nIf you feel you need to, then so be it - that's your choice - but I think it's unreasonable to demand others do the same before they visit you.\n\n*he has a ick and won't even allow people to use the words poop or fart around him.*\n\nBut... he used the phrase \"poop particles\" in his own post!\n\n*Everyone has boundaries. And poop is one of mine.*\n\nDoes that mean every time you have a bowel movement, you have to shower and change your clothes? And every time *he* has a bowel movement, you expect him to do the same?\n\nBecause that is the logical consequence of what you're saying here. In regard to germs or contamination or whatever is triggering your \"ick\" response, there is no logical difference between him wiping his own butt after using the toilet, and him cleaning up after his brother soils himself. As long as you scrub your hands thoroughly afterwards, using soap, they're fine.\n\nIf you are icked out by the possibility of contamination by his brother's feces, you must be equally icked out by his, or your own, or any random person you meet and shake hands with. I'm surprised you can bear to go near him.\n\nI work with elderly and disabled clients, some of whom have Covid. I'm not a nurse or carer, but I work with people who are. I share offices and lunch rooms and bathrooms with them. They've spent their mornings cleaning up shit and piss and vomit and drool. They wear gloves and a mask. If the job is really messy, or the resident has tested positive, they wear full PPE. And then they take it off and scrub their hands and have lunch. It would be completely unreasonable to expect them to shower and change their clothes just to sit and have lunch with the rest of us.\n\nIt sounds like you and your partner are just not compatible. Especially if you feel he deliberately misrepresented the situation here, presumably just to get NTA votes.\n\nI'm not yet convinced he did, but that doesn't much matter. What's more important is that *you* believe he did, so much so that you feel you had to come here and put your side forward because he has been unfair.

But as an aside, you need to ask for the nursing supervisor, and the patient advocate for your brother. I'd bet anything they are \"punishing\" him by neglecting his care because he's an addict. I'd also about bet they aren't properly treating his pain. Remind the nursing supervisor, the patient advocate and the drs that patient neglect and failing to appropriately treat pain because someone is an addict is medical malpractice and illegal discrimination. It's also a good reason for complaints to the medical board, the nursing license board and filing a lawsuit. You will need to advocate for your brother during this time. It won't be easy.

I clean the entire apartment by myself. Her only responsibility is to clean up after the dogs and take care of them.", "Agreed. I have done some time as a CNA in a hospital. Nurses have *a lot* of priorities to balance. But timely delivery of medication and timely cleanup of bodily waste are high up the top of their list regardless of patient lifestyle or diagnosis. I would be ashamed to find out family members were cleaning feces off their loved ones on my shift. Their treatment of your brother is unethical and illegal.", "That\u2019s what actually happened.

Which I told him was fucked up. \n\nI said he should visit his brother every day while he is in the hospital. He was planning on spending the whole weekend with me and not visiting him tmmrw so he could spend the weekend with me.

They're probably tired and sweaty and grubby. I would too, if I were them! But I'd do it for my own comfort, not because I'm going to disgust the people I live with.\n\nBesides, no one expects such workers to shower and change at lunchtime, after half a shift. At my workplace, they just remove their PPE, scrub their hands well, and come to the lunchroom. I'm cool with that. I don't get icked out and refuse to share a lunchroom with them.\n\nI don't shower immediately after work, because my job isn't as physical as my coworkers' jobs - a lot of mine is spent at a desk, or sitting talking to clients one on one - but I do change out of my work clothes.\n\nOP's girlfriend said \"*I wouldn't go to someone's house straight from the hospital without showering and changing my clothes*.\" She's not even talking about *working* at the hospital. She's talking about *visiting* a patient.

It doesn't sound like they're your dogs; it sounds like they're her dogs.\n\nRegardless, if poop is really that much of a problem for you to the point that you can't even walk your own dogs, it might be a good idea to consult with a professional. I say this as someone with OCD myself. I would have a *really tough time* cleaning up poop, but I also have a therapist and medication that help me handle uncomfortable situations and the anxiety they provoke. \n\n[Here's a self-test for various kinds of anxiety, including OCD and phobias.](https://anxieties.com/self-help-resources/self-test-symptoms-anxiety-panic-ocd-phobias/) I've seen the doctor who created the test for my own treatment so it's not just some random link I found, although it is a self-test so you might want to see a therapist for more tailored results. \n\nSomething useful to keep in mind if you seek out a professional: \"psychiatrist\" refers to a medical doctor who prescribes psychiatric medications and usually does short visits with no therapy included, while psychologists/therapists/counselors do various kinds of therapy. They can both diagnose, but you need to see one or the other (or both!) depending on what kind of approach you want to take after the diagnosis. (I've seen people complain that they went to a psychiatrist and \"they just pushed pills at me!\" and it's like... that is their specialty, it's what they went to med school for lol) You'll often find practicing groups made of one or more psychiatrists and usually multiple therapists all working together.", "Exactly. This is purposeful and so very wrong.", "He wasn\u2019t even going to go visit his brother bc he said he was too overwhelmed by the situation. \n\nIn fact , I said to him before all this happened.

Also running to Reddit to exploit your brothers addiction and heath issues so strangers on the internet will tell you what a great person you are is the beacon on compassion. \n\nAlso when you do things from your heart , you don\u2019t need to tell the world about it.
