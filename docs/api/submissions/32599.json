We all finished uni courses last year. I am doing a postgrad course at the uni, they entered employment. We got together via mutual friends as we were all looking for a rental. I spend most of my time at uni or working in my room.\n\nSix weeks after we moved in Mia came in from visiting her parents with a cat in tow that was hers when she lived at home before uni. She hadn't been able to have it at uni so her parents had kept it. I was not happy. I hate cats due to a bad childhood experience and was annoyed she hadn't discussed it with us. She just said the landlord didn't mind and that it would be no trouble. Amy likes cats and was pleased so I was in the minority. For the sake of harmony I didn't make a big issue of it, I was just clear that I would not do anything for the cat at any point.\n\nFew weeks ago Mia announced that she had a 3 month work placement in another part of the country. She would get free accommodation so wasn't moving out permanently. She'd still pay her share of rent but couldn't take the cat. Again I was not happy, but Amy said she would look after it. Mia left 3 weeks ago.\n\nShortly after, Amy got ill with health issues I won't go into here. It means she has to move in with her parents temporarily. She left a week ago and will be away until after Christmas so I'm left on my own in the house with the cat.\n\nI immediately called Mia and said she had to sort someone else to take the cat. She said that was unfair of me because she hadn't known Amy wouldn't be around and there was no one else around locally who could take it. I said that was not my problem, it is not my cat. She said to give her a few days.\n\nThe cat is not \"no trouble\". It is needy. It goes outside but whines by the back door after being out for an hour or so. If I let it in, it's not long before it's whining outside my bedroom door. I have loads of uni work to do and this is distracting. It did this even when Mia and Amy were here but it's worse now that they've gone. I've been feeding it but hate having to do this. The food stinks the place out and is running low.\n\nIt's a week since I spoke to Mia and no sign of the cat going anywhere. I message her daily about it but she just fobs me off. In desperation, I called her parents directly to ask them to come and get it. They were annoyed at me and said why couldn't I just look after it. They couldn't just drop everything and come for the cat as they live over three hours away. I said that unless someone picked the cat up within 48 hours (which is how much food it has left here) I will take it to the local animal shelter and tell them the full story - that its owner has effectively abandoned the cat into the care of someone who does not want to be responsible for it.\n\nMia has blown up my phone since then, calling me an AH.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702041767, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dmpzr/aita_for_refusing_to_look_after_my_housemates_cat/", "score": 443, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love cats and would gladly take care of this cat to keep it out of the shelter. But the cat is Mia's responsibility, not yours. She should not have brought the cat to the home in the first place without unanimous consent. Forcing someone who never wanted the cat in the first place to take care of it is being an AH. Fair warning, you will probably need a new roommate after this.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't have obligation to take care of their belongings. They will blame you if shit goes wrong. They are fucking idiots to force someone who are afraid of cats to look after it. Do they really love their pets?", "NTA, but if you asked Mia to stump up for a cattery while she's away,  it would be kinder.  She definitely needs to be sending money.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nYou\u2019ve given her more than long enough to make alternative arrangements after her initial arrangement fell through. \n\nShe sounds like she isn\u2019t ready to take care of a pet on her own and the cat will be better off being rehomed to someone who is.", "Being a cat lover, I kind of want to AH you.  However, the cat did move in under your objections. You made it clear you would do nothing for this cat.  So, I guess I'll have to go with NTA.", "NTA. why didn\u2019t the roommate watching the cat take it with her? You told them from the start that you wouldn\u2019t be watching the cat and that you didn\u2019t like cats. The only options I see are the shelter or charging her for effectively pet sitting.", "NTA. This cat is not yours, and the owner abandonned her. \n\nYou clearly stated your intention and a timeline. It's her cat, so it's her responsibility to find accommodations for him.", "NTA - I\u2019m a cat person, but this is about your roommate stepping up to her responsibilities. It\u2019s her cat, she needs to make arrangements. You gave her enough warning.", "Nta she is The cat is hers not yours.  Her responsibility. You never agreed to take care of the cat.  You were up front with that when she brought it home.  She has no right to try and force you to take care of HER cat. She can pay to board the cat. If her parents ask why you can't just take care of the cat tell because it is their daughter's cat and not your cat.", "NTA\n\nI love cats, but I'm this case OP is not the AH and the ESH doesn't apply either.\n\n-OP has a trauma experience involving cats. As much as I love cats, I have to imagine living with a being that reminds you of that daily, that that doesn't have distance from you, and you have to care for it is torturous. I cannot care for spiders. If I replace the word  cat with spider I couldn't imagine 24hrs let alone being stuck finals week trying to study with a spider all over me. Because cat owner and roommate where there in the past, it is possible OP had little contact with the cat which means these changes have impacted the exposure OP gets to the cat in a drastic way.\n\n-Cat owner not only brought the cat without consent of the OP, but upon hearing of the roommate's unexpected illness did not proactively schedule alternatives despite knowing OP trauma and feelings around the cat. As a pet owner I would never leave my pet with someone who has told me from the beginning they wanted nothing to do with it, let alone tell them to just stick it out and then go no contact for a whole week. That cat owner and ill roommate both knew OPs feelings and still didn't plan an alternative shows their lack of care for OP and the cat. \n\n-OP has tried several times to get support from cat owner before the decision to take to a shelter. OP has tried communicating with cat owner and was GHOSTED. What kind of pet owner ghosts the only person who has their cat? This is the definition of abandonment. No consent to care for an animal, no communication on care. It was the OP that reached out to the cat owner's parents to take the cat and the parents refused (shoving care to others seems to be a connection in this family). Three hours driving sucks, but not impossible. \n\nI don't like that OP wants to take the cat to a shelter (I can only hope the shelter OP wants to take them to is a no-kill), but I recognize that for people that don't own animals that's the go to. Pet boarding, using apps like Rover, or sometimes boarding at the vet is something you learn and have more access to when you're a dedicated animal owner. Yes you can do a quick Google search, but there's extra steps for these that should be what the cat owner does to help OP in coordinating the cat's care. OP trying to coordinate that during finals without the support of cat owner or all other related people means that a shelter is the most accessible choice to OP given the lack of support (including the lack of financial support for alternatives and ghosting). That she gave two days before planning on taking the cat to a shelter after the constant unresponsive attempts at communication and finally cat owner responded is actually something to notice. She didn't immediately take the cat to a shelter, but it is a last resort due the unresponsive nature of all the people around OP.\n\nThis isn't the best environment for the cat. The cat is an afterthought of the owner and OP is not a cat person (and has trauma with cats) and has tried multiple times to coordinate with the cat owner on alternative care but was ignored.\n\nGiven these reasons, OP is NTA.", "NTA. She should\u2019ve left the cat with her parents from the start. At the very least she should\u2019ve asked them to take the cat again for the 3 months she would be gone. At the very very least, when Amy got sick she should have arranged for her parents to pickup the cat or hired someone to pickup the cat and drop it off at her parents. \n\nI don\u2019t believe transient young adults who aren\u2019t really settled in terms of career, living situation, and finances should own pets to begin with. I had so many friends in my 20s with animals that wound up being given to their parents or rehomed when they got a new schedule or took opportunities to travel or work in another country.", "This is insane. As an avid animal lover who would gladly take care of a friend's cat, I'd be pissed off if they didn't even properly ask, provide enough food, etc. Not to mention, PLENTY of shelters in my area board animals for those who can't take care of them. It's well within your housemates ability to call the shelter if she's desperate for care for her cat. It would suck to be in her position (expecting your cat to be in proper care, but falls through), but as soon as it was an issue she should have been on top of it.\n\nYou calling the parents then offering to take the cat to a safe place out of your care (the shelter) is well within your right. NTA, even if I do feel for the poor cat who probably misses it's owner, and I feel for the owner who probably miss her pet.", "NTA.\n\nI want to be harsher on you, but that's because I'm a cat lover myself and it sounds like this one is a sweetie that wants to be around you.  But you've been trying to find a solution and the owner is not cooperating.  If you'd jumped straightaway to sending the cat to a shelter, I'd say ESH because you should give more of a grace period.  But you've given that grace period and still nothing.  I'm sad, but you're not wrong at all.", "NTA you don't like cats and you never agreed to this", "NTA  \nIt's unfortunate that Amy got sick but that doesn't mean that you become responsible for the cat. Hopefully Mia's parents show up to rescue you - and the cat.", "NTA...but dont take it out on the cat. The cat is an innocent party in this and is just doing \"cat things\". I think you need to have a serious sit down with your roommate and let her know you're not up for watching this cat while she's away. She needs to line up a sitter if she's not home.", "NTA\n\nYou have given them 48h to find an alternative solution: their parents or a friend can pick it, they can find a catsitter or whatever. \n\nEven though I think you are NTA, your relationship with her is already broken.", "NTA for not wanting to take care of someone else\u2019s pet that you didn\u2019t want in the house in the first place. YTA for threatening to take it to the shelter where it will be traumatized and most likely euthanized. I know you\u2019re annoyed af but try not to take it out on the cat, it\u2019s not his/her fault that Mia put it in the predicament that it\u2019s in. It\u2019s a domesticated animal that relies on humans to take care of it. Please try to work with Mia to figure out other options besides sending it to the shelter. Poor thing.", "NTA. I love cats but the owner could have AT THE VERY LEAST provided enough cat food. That's such a basic thing.", "Ooof.\n\nNTA \n\nA week to figure out someone getting the cat is enough time.", "I understand that it isn\u2019t your obligation and that the cat owner definitely is in the wrong, but it\u2019s a pet. And you\u2019re possibly taking it to a shelter to possibly be killed because your life has been disrupted and you simply can\u2019t handle it for the next few weeks. I get it I would hate it, too. But I would also never do a pet wrong like that. So: to your roommate NTA; to the cat: YTA.\n\nETA: suggestion because I hate to see a previously loved and cared for pet taken to a shelter over an annoyance\u2014 can the owner call a kennel with her cc info and have your board the cat? My kennel does long term boarding and that could be an option.", "I\u2019d say NTA because you did warn them you weren\u2019t taking care of it however, it\u2019s an innocent animal and right now, if you don\u2019t take care of it, it\u2019s quite likely it could be killed at the shelter. I know it\u2019s annoying, and the owner should be fronting all the animals expenses, but it\u2019s only a cat. Cats are literally the LEAST time consuming and demanding mammals to own! Try having a parrot! \n\nAll you have to do is feed it and let it in and out. I would expect a bottle of something for your trouble when she gets home and a refund for what you\u2019ve spent. But it\u2019s only a couple of weeks and the animal will be off your hands. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just about your room mate, this is about the cat. He has no control over this situation, he\u2019s just doing what cats do. He needs a little sympathy. It\u2019s just the decent thing to do.", "NTA\n\nBut don't contact a 'shelter', find a cat rescue. Some of them will take in cats in emergency situations until the owners can take them again. Shelters may kill the cat - which WOULD make you TA.", "NTA\n\nThey are abandaoning the cat with you. You were clear you could not look after the pet and she and her parents are doing nothing about it. Mia is actaivly ignoring you, just hoping you will take care of her pet. She is not even trying to arrange to pay for food for her pet. \n\nYou have been more than generous abou this and given her pet a home for over a week. If she doesn't care enough to make sure her cat is taken care of than she doesn't get to complain if you end up having to take it to the pound.", "Cat lover,  Have 2 of them.  It's not fair to saddle you with the responsibility of the cat.  You made it clear you were not going to take care of the cat. nta", "NTA. all of the yta and esh votes are seriously missing the point. OP has no obligation towards this cat, OP is caring for the cat while looking for other accommodations. OP isn\u2019t talking about just dumping the cat on the side of the road .. a shelter might not be ideal but i think it\u2019s a hell of a lot better than OP and the cat continuing to reside together in a situation which will most likely lead to neither of them being happy.\n\nhave any of you thought about how unfair this is to the cat? OP isn\u2019t a cat person, she won\u2019t be giving the cat the attention it deserves. even in the short term it\u2019s not fair to the cat. nor is it fair to OP.", "If Mia cared about her cat and treating her house-mates fairly she could spend the weekend picking it up, returning it to the family home, and getting back to wherever she works.

NTA.", "When examining this solely from the perspective of \"I said I won't take care of it, and Mia should have asked permission before bringing the cat to your apartment,\" you are NTA.\n\nI urge you to pause and consider if escalating the situation to a point where Mia might lose the cat is the best choice. Are you generally content with your roommates? Do they maintain cleanliness, pay rent on time, respect your study space, and refrain from frequent parties?\n\nActing impulsively could lead to two upset roommates who may retaliate (Amy might resent your lack of help with the situation when she got sick). This could leave you seeking new roommates or moving out, risking the chance of encountering a messy or party-prone replacement or someone even worse.", "NTA. So she expects you to take care of her cat when you explicitly told her that you're not willing to do that numerous times. Even though you live together, it doesn't mean that you are responsible for your roommate's cat.", "NTA. I'm a cat person and feel really badly for the poor thing. But you made it clear from the start that you wouldn't take any responsibility for the cat. At first, this wasn't an issue because your other housemate was taking care of it, and obviously her being unable to continue that is an unexpected circumstance. And you've taken care of the cat since then while trying to get it's owner to sort something else out. You've given her plenty of time to arrange for someone else to look after the cat, and only then did you call her parents. It's not your cat, you have zero obligation to take care of it, especially as you weren't asked to do so and wouldn't have agreed even if you were, which your housemate is well aware of. It's also not on you to spend your money on food for someone else's cat. \n\nThe owner has had plenty of time to make other arrangements. When she didn't, you called her parents to come and get it. When they refused, and I assume you explained, or the owner did, the situation here, and knowing that you were almost out of food for it, you made the only reasonable call left. You should make it clear that you won't be spending money on this cat, so it's either they pick it up, it goes to the animal shelter, or it starves. \n\nThe cat isn't, and never was, your responsibility, and it's incredibly entitled for these people to demand you take care of their cat against your wishes, especially when it includes spending your own money and being distracted from your uni work. Stand firm, and if they haven't picked the cat up by the deadline, follow through and take the cat to the shelter since the owner has abandoned it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are handling these AHs well.", "ESH.\n\nIt's the cat's owner's responsibility to make sure her cat has appropriate care, including food, while she's away from said cat. She should have immediately begun looking for short-term options and sent you money for food. It's neglectful and ridiculous this wasn't a priority for her to begin with. And she absolutely should be compensating you for time and food or supplies you've purchased.\n\nOn the other hand, no one planned to put you in this position, and you say Amy will be back after Christmas. That's only like... 2 weeks and some spare change away, which is already probably how long it will take to find a shelter able to take the cat. It's not like you're stuck with a cat until Mia gets back, you're stuck with a cat for a relatively short amount of time, and it doesn't sound like it's been a huge imposition aside from the meowing for attention. Also, 1 week isn't unexpected for finding some kind of alternate care; where I live, cat sitters and boarding are backed up a month at least. When she \"fobs\" you off, does she say she's still looking? That might not be a lie.\n\nHopefully the parents now come pick the cat up. If they don't, you're within your rights to take it to a shelter, but please make it a no kill one. You would be lawfully right but still the AH if you put the animal in a situation to lose its life just because you didn't want to set down a few cans a day for 2 weeks and somehow haven't used headphones (a staple of my years at uni, thanks to a noisy apartment).\n\nDemand to be paid for the food you buy, which is WELL within your rights as a baseline. If no one picks the cat up, and you decide to wait it out until Amy returns: plenty of uni students would be willing to come hang out with a cat, if you make it known one needs some attention so it'll stop bugging you as much. Maybe some of your friends, or you can post about it? You may even be able to foist it on campus mental health services for therapy days, we saw quite a bit of that in my uni.", "NTA.\n\nDon't get a pet if you can't or don't want to take care of it.\r  \n\r  \nShe could have made a deal with you where she pays you for taking care of it, or something along those lines.

This is so she can arrange picking up the cat when she returns. Some foster programs do temporary housing like that when an owner cannot care for their pet. \n\nOn the other hand, you can contact them & tell them that your roommate is away & abandoned their cat there. You can give the program her contact info & give Mia their info. Let her work out the logistics of (if she can) get her cat back. \n\nThis is better than just dropping the cat at a shelter because it shows you looking after the long term care of her cat more than her.

We all finished uni courses last year. I am doing a postgrad course at the uni, they entered employment. We got together via mutual friends as we were all looking for a rental. I spend most of my time at uni or working in my room.\n\nSix weeks after we moved in Mia came in from visiting her parents with a cat in tow that was hers when she lived at home before uni. She hadn't been able to have it at uni so her parents had kept it. I was not happy. I hate cats due to a bad childhood experience and was annoyed she hadn't discussed it with us. She just said the landlord didn't mind and that it would be no trouble. Amy likes cats and was pleased so I was in the minority. For the sake of harmony I didn't make a big issue of it, I was just clear that I would not do anything for the cat at any point.\n\nFew weeks ago Mia announced that she had a 3 month work placement in another part of the country. She would get free accommodation so wasn't moving out permanently. She'd still pay her share of rent but couldn't take the cat. Again I was not happy, but Amy said she would look after it. Mia left 3 weeks ago.\n\nShortly after, Amy got ill with health issues I won't go into here. It means she has to move in with her parents temporarily. She left a week ago and will be away until after Christmas so I'm left on my own in the house with the cat.\n\nI immediately called Mia and said she had to sort someone else to take the cat. She said that was unfair of me because she hadn't known Amy wouldn't be around and there was no one else around locally who could take it. I said that was not my problem, it is not my cat. She said to give her a few days.\n\nThe cat is not \"no trouble\". It is needy. It goes outside but whines by the back door after being out for an hour or so. If I let it in, it's not long before it's whining outside my bedroom door. I have loads of uni work to do and this is distracting. It did this even when Mia and Amy were here but it's worse now that they've gone. I've been feeding it but hate having to do this. The food stinks the place out and is running low.\n\nIt's a week since I spoke to Mia and no sign of the cat going anywhere. I message her daily about it but she just fobs me off. In desperation, I called her parents directly to ask them to come and get it. They were annoyed at me and said why couldn't I just look after it. They couldn't just drop everything and come for the cat as they live over three hours away. I said that unless someone picked the cat up within 48 hours (which is how much food it has left here) I will take it to the local animal shelter and tell them the full story - that its owner has effectively abandoned the cat into the care of someone who does not want to be responsible for it.\n\nMia has blown up my phone since then, calling me an AH.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA.

I understand being frustrated, but don't take the cat to an animal shelter. That's fucked up. It's only a couple of months, not years. You need to chill.\n\nMia should have come back for a weekend, take the cat to her parents, then return to wherever work sent her. If she has a personal emergency, work will fly her home. Depending what's she's doing, there may be literal legal/contractual requirements for her work to allow her to come home a certain amount.\n\nYou're really exaggerating the effort to take care of it, though. You don't have to let it outside. Keep food and water and the litterbox in Mia's room, put the cat in there when you're trying to get work done. Let it out for a little while in the evenings or mornings.\n\nAlso, if Amy is coming back after Christmas... That's like 3 weeks away. I'm sorry you're inconvenienced, but it's just not that bad. Mia made arrangements with Amy. Amy unfortunately got sick. This is a tough situation. Taking the cat to a shelter because you can't be bothered to feed it and scoop litter every couple days for like a month is absurd. Good luck living with Mia when she gets back.", "ESH.

You are being more than generous.", "NTA her parents are only 3 hours away. She should have dropped it back off to their house before she left.", "As an animal lover, NTA. It was absolutely shitty of Mia to move her cat into your shared place without discussing it with everyone first. What if someone was allergic? Not liking cats is also a valid reason for a roommate to not bring one in. Ignoring your messages about HER cat until you threatened taking it to a shelter, also shitty. \n\nHowever, I do want to point out that the cat also has zero control over its living situation and is also probably stressed from the move and changes in its environment (it can take weeks to months for them to really acclimate to big home/people changes). Rather than a shelter where its future would be a huge question mark, maybe have Mia pay for a cattery or boarding facility if you're dead set against taking care of it any longer.", "NTA.

Please take care of it, but let give you some tips for controlling a cat better:  in places you don't want them to howl for entry, put down a vacuum cleaner and run the cable far away. \n\nWhen the cat meows at the spot, plug in the vacuum and scare them shitless.  For most cats this trick fixes the behavior in one try.  \n\nYou can also make the cat stay outside longer, give it some kind of box for shelter and move feedings to outside.

You made your objections clear from the beginning, and honestly you're very kind to (begrudgingly) care for an animal you intensely dislike while working to find a permanent housing solution for the cat.

YTA. Yeah I think you're an asshole. Getting rid of someone's pet because you don't like it is cruel. She didn't abandon it, she set up an arrangement for someone to look after it AND THAT PERSON GOT SICK.

You telling me 3 months of rent money can't buy a bag of cheap cat food? The owner is coming back in a few months; she didn't fly off to jamaica for an indeterminate amount of time. For fucks sake YOU could coordinate with the pet owner and find a shelter nearby to take it temporarily but nah, you hate cats so fuck it.\n\nI know a bunch of people are going to jump up my ass all \"but the pet owner didn't clear it with op first! It's not OPs job to take care of someone else's pet!\" And yeah they'd be technically right but your attitude is shitty. You don't mention any aggression, any destruction of property, any allergies. Nothing about any real problem the cat is causing. You just say \"this cat is annoying and I don't like it, would I be TA to get rid of it?\" And the answer is YES. Jesus christ you sound like a prick. Shelters are OVERCROWDED right now, they have been since covid, they are constantly looking for people to foster pets and when they run out of room those animals get neglected or killed.

Be prepared to lose both those girls as friends over this. I don\u2019t think I would ever have just left my cat alone in a house with someone who clearly hated it so she\u2019s an idiot for that. The parents also suck. You bet your ass I would drive 3 hours to save my cat", "NTA!!! The roommate didn\u2019t even leave extra food for the cat! Why on earth should the OP be in any way responsible when the roommate literally did abandon the cat by not making arrangements for it. And if the roommate loved the cat so much, she should have figured that sh-t out. I have two cats that are my kids, and I NEVER f-k around with where they live, how much they have to eat, and care when I am not at home. I pay up the behind for pet care when I\u2019m gone\u2014and I did that while I was in school. The roommate had the (incorrect) expectation that someone was going to baby her, and take over her responsibility for a living mammal that she didn\u2019t even ask to bring in to the house. The roommate is an absolute AH, her parents are AHs for refusing to help their daughter (three hours? To pick up their daughter\u2019s pet to make sure it doesn\u2019t go to the shelter? They\u2019re entitled AHs as well), and leaving it to a roommate that has been saying for days upon days that someone needs to step up and take care of the animal. Absolutely NTA. I have sympathy for the animal, but that\u2019s not OP\u2019s problem. If you have a pet, you are responsible for their care. If you leave that care to someone else, when they already said they wouldn\u2019t do it, then that is abandonment, and warrants a shelter.", "NTA.  I will never understand why people bring living beings, human or animal, into shared living situations without getting a \"yes\" from all people living there.

Also if the cat was welcome to her parents house at first, they can take it back. I knew a girl who abandoned her cat in an apartment she left in a hurry.

But you, while you are not obligated to take care of the cat, it would be the *nice* thing to do. So far, nothing about caring for the cat seems particularly hard. Its honestly weird that you are being so obstinate about not doing it. A normal, nice person would say, \"sure\" and then list some conditions and requirements for doing it (food shipped to you, etc.).

Then any consequences rest solely on her shoulders.  \n\nBut regardless, I see this permanently souring the relationship between you and your roommates (if Amy also likes the cat), even if the fault isn't yours.  So you will probably want to start looking into other living arrangements.", "Additionally it would have taken very little on roommates part to call a cat boarding place and arrange for the cat to be dropped off there for a few weeks. It\u2019s that roommate doesn\u2019t want to- she wants to be lazy and not take responsibility of the pet.

These are very young people, and Mia is clearly already someone who doesn't think ahead very well (not talking to her housemates at all before moving in a pet).

Not everyone  comes out of uni understanding all of this stuff.  Sometimes you have to make mistakes, or just BE TOLD by an adult that \"you should be doing X in this situation\".\n\nI'm not saying any of that to excuse Mia.  I'm just saying that I would not assume she has even thought of these other problem-solving moves already and isn't willing to do them. I can just very much believe she hasn't thought of it -- just as it sounds like she didn't think of offering her roommates some money to watch her cat, or even leave them money to buy food and litter??????  (OP doesn't mention it, and mentions the food running out in 48 hours.)  This also doesn't surprise me.  When you're young and inexperienced, you're more likely to ask for favors for free from friends, than think to try to compensate them in a fairy way.\n\n(No, not all young folks are like this!  Some get it much earlier that you don't ask for big favors -- like helping to move, or long-term cat-sitting -- without AT LEAST \"hey pizza and beer for everyone\" or \"and I will watch your cat next time\" or whatever is fair.   Mia sounds like she is this type of \"not realizing she should be offering\" person, though.)\n\nThis is Mia's moment where she learns some important stuff about being an adult.  Apparently that means somebody having to tell her how to do some stuff.\n\nSo, yeah.  OP should tell both MIa and the parents: in 48 hours, you will EITHER arrange to board the cat somewhere, and you are paying; or you will tell me of other arrangements; OR I take the cat to a shelter.\n\nThat's not just kinder (though it is), it puts the ball back in their court, as arranging boarding is a reasonable solution.  Expensive!  (I boarded 2 cats once while I was away on a 3-week trip along with the two friends who usually did cat-sitting for me.)  But it's doable.  Either Mia can come up with the money, or her parents can.  No 3-hour drive necessary.\n\nI do have to say that, while I feel for Amy and whatever unknown medical issues she is having... if I were in a situation where I had agree to watch someone's cat, knew my roommate \\*would not\\* do it, and I got sick, I would feel at least SOME sense of responsibility of finding a substitute myself.

My friend was living in a pet-friendly apartment, but I wasn't, so she said my cat could live with her until I found a place when we graduated. However, my cat peed on her bed and fought with her cat, so I hid him in my room, which was fine, until I had to move back in with my parents (who hate cats) because the lease on my new place didn't start right away. Luckily, another friend was able to hang on to him for the summer, but even though my cat wasn't a bother, I paid her. Still, looking back on it, I hate that I put him in that situation.
