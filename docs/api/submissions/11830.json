Ultimately I realized she would be way more miserable spending a day on a plane and non stop moving than I would be sitting on a beach slightly bored. Also, I realized right after all the wedding stress, I might not even be up for an active honeymoon. \n\nThe point of the honeymoon is to relax and spend time just the two of you after the wedding, so solo honeymooning seems like the first stage to divorce because your fundamental understanding of a marriage is off base. Find a compromise and stop pissing your fianc\u00e9 off before the wedding, believe me it\u2019s not worth it.

I\u2019d have lost my shit, too, if my husband suggested separate honeymoons.

She wants to go to a beach resort, as well as visit her grandmother who lives in the country she's advocating for. I want to travel to Ireland and sightsee with my best friend, who has absolutely sold me on the concept. He has family there and visited multiple times as a child. \n\nThe premise is that you go have these adventures, absence makes the heart grow fonder, and when he return home together you're so excited to see each other and tell one another all about what you experienced. \n\nI sent her the link to the article and it has caused a huge blowout fight between us. I told her it was merely a suggestion and a concept I thought was interesting.
