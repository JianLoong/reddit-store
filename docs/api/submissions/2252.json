I am someone that would of said what she said and meant it sincerely.....actually hopefully looking forward to when I can do the same. When I say things like this people often think I'm taking a cheap shot at them. I'm not! That is a neurotypical thing to do and that is what people assume I must be doing. I'm not!

She was making a (bad) joke and it wasn't received in the way she expected, and you're pregnant so it hit you at least a bit harder than anyone would have expected it to. Your ILs are protective of you because you're pregnant but everyone blew this way out of proportion, and I can see why your FSIL is annoyed because of the way everyone's reacted to this. And hormones really do make pregnancy suck (I get super emotional on my period so it's probably 100x worse when you're pregnant), so I understand why you're super upset too. I think you should probably text your FSIL and explain why it hurt you and that you probably didn't mean to get so upset, but it really hit a painful topic for you. If she isn't an AH, she'll apologize and explain why she's so irritated and you two will make up or at least clear up the air. Don't apologize for getting upset until after she apologizes to you for making the joke.

She said she was jealous you had the time off, which she probably was and doesn't understand how ill some women get, and that it wasn't a picnic for you. I do think she was insensitive, but you should have said I've been really ill with this pregnancy and I am really jealous of you as I would much rather be at work then locked in the bathroom every day.

Then you could have talked it out. Instead she didn't and now she is blaming you for the reaction to her comment. I have a question. Is your due date anywhere near their wedding date?

As someone who is pregnant currently and also had to quit my job due to always having to hug the toilet, I get it.

I can't imagine someone who's supposed to be like family coming over and basically calling me lazy and saying they were jealous I had the grand luck of being able to do nothing all day when I'd prefer to work. That's rubbing salt into already fresh wounds, not to mention I'm assuming OP is still pregnant/barely gave birth if she's still unable to go back to work.

She also joked about how she couldn\u2019t wait to be married so she could do the same.\n\nEven if you ignore all of the pregnancy issue, there is just such a dismissive attitude. The house renovations don\u2019t deserve praise because OP had the time to do it? No one says \u201csit around doing nothing all day\u201d without ill intent, that\u2019s always a negative comment. Then the last comment, that getting married means you\u2019re set. I am not neurotypical, and it has taken me a long time to learn some things, bullying at school hurt and confused me at the same time. But some digs are not that subtle.\n\nBut the real giveaway is that OP has said in a comment that the fianc\u00e9 knows that OP didn\u2019t want to stop working and is sensitive about it.", "Yeah, she knows.

She\u2019s not having the time of her life. My first trimester I was too I\u2019ll to stand. I know the feeling.

Treating it like a vacation when it's anything but.\n\nOP was medically unable to work during (early) pregnancy, even though she wanted to keep working, and SIL called that \"sitting around doing nothing\" and joked about being jealous, even though she wants the perceived easy bits without the hard.

She's got raging pregnancy hormones everything is going to make her emotional, when I was pregnant with my first I cried for ten minutes straight because a pen rolled off the table... ridiculous? Yes, but it set me off. She had no control over how her husband would  react and telling someone the reason you won't be joining them for dinner is perfectly reasonable and not \"tattling\".", "What on earth kind of take is this? Are you the fianc\u00e9e?

And if her telling her husband what hurt her makes her an AH, lord save me I'd be dammed because I tell my boyfriend everything. She chose to share what bothered her about someone to her significant other, thats called COMMUNICATION.\n\nSecond, you don't just go around telling someone they \"sit around and do nothing\", that's just basic sense dude. If you fail to see that, well this comment won't make sense anyways.\n\nAlso, props to the in-laws for sticking up for her. She must've realised her words have consequences", "In person, among a couple people? Yeah, digs aren\u2019t jokes. Jokes are funny. Personal digs aren\u2019t.", "To be fair, there\u2019s a difference between thinking something isn\u2019t funny vs having your feelings hurt by it.

Like if a five-year-old tells you a joke, you might not find it funny, but they were actually trying to tell a joke.

Honestly if everyone\u2019s first reaction is to scream at each other, I can\u2019t even think about how there could possibly be a healthy family dynamic. There would have been a conversation if husband listened to BIL to calm down and talk about what SIL said.", "oh wow, then you are absolutely NTA. that\u2019s extremely tasteless of her and she knew better. i\u2019m sorry that happened to you :(\n\nalso, you aren\u2019t responsible for how your in laws or husband emotionally respond to the situation, so it\u2019s bizarre that she\u2019s blaming you for something she brought upon herself.", "So now how does it get resolved? \n\nDoes the woman need to grovel to OP and her husband about her thoughtless comment?", "Being non weight bearing for eight weeks was probably the worst thing that ever happened to me (physically), and I\u2019m a klutz.", "She's not a stay at home,  she's temporarily disabled due to her pregnancy.", "That's true, but sometimes people can make jokes in bad taste. If OP comes over and tells me that she and her FSIL don't get along well anyway, I'll change my judgement", "Yes that is true if you trash talking the host. \n\nBut she just told the truth from her point of view, that OP got to stay home and remodel the house and she could remodel her own house if she could be at home too. It's bad because we know that the OP has been really ill, did she understand that though?\n\nFrom my point of view the reasonable response would be to call her out straight away and say I can assure you I would much rather be at work and not stuck at home sick all the time. It seems OP didn't say anything at all and then the husband went full nuclear, kicking them out and turning the family against her.\n\nWe don't know what the GF would have done if she was called out straight away with a 'come on, that's not called for', she may have apologiesed straight away. We don't know what her reaction would have been. \n\nNow they have gone nuclear and raised the stakes really high, which makes it way more difficult for the GF to apologise, because the response to the original offence is way out of proportion. The GF and finance probably feel that their treatment has been too harsh, which brings in a lot of high emotions.\n\nSo the resolution to the argument is so much harder now.

I can't imagine your 9, but at the same time, people have been horrified when I joke about nearly passing out in the hospital bathroom after vomiting. Who knew not being able to hydrate after a spinal tap would lead to the most brutal migraine I'd ever had lol. My head felt like those cartoons where they show a thermometer rise and then burst from the heat.", "I hate the pain scale. I can never figure out how to rank myself on it. Worse than yesterday but better than the day before is never an option.", "Currently I\u2019m a showjumping groom (have worked on and off for over 6 years). Have also worked as a livery rider (2 1/2 years) and a riding instructor (1 year). Funnily enough, the being tossed off at a gallop into a wall happened when I was in equestrian club at university on what was supposed to be a \u201cbombproof\u201d Welsh D. \n\nOne kick in the back was from a 3 year old mare who cow kicked cause she spooked at something, accidentally brushed the door we were walking past, did some acrobats and somehow managed to kick me in the back. The other kick was from a senile old mare at the livery yard who got excited when she saw me and wanted to play. \n\nI have worked with a variety of breeds but mostly warm bloods. \n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019m guessing from sheer luck that I haven\u2019t hurt myself more seriously. I can 100% believe that me working with horses, due to it being physically active, is what has helped me with my back.", "I couldn't live without Zofran lol", "Me neither. I had Zofran, promethazine, and like 2 other I had to take regularly. One was a lax to help with the zpoops"]}
