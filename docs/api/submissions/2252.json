I am someone that would of said what she said and meant it sincerely.....actually hopefully looking forward to when I can do the same.

She was making a (bad) joke and it wasn't received in the way she expected, and you're pregnant so it hit you at least a bit harder than anyone would have expected it to. Your ILs are protective of you because you're pregnant but everyone blew this way out of proportion, and I can see why your FSIL is annoyed because of the way everyone's reacted to this. And hormones really do make pregnancy suck (I get super emotional on my period so it's probably 100x worse when you're pregnant), so I understand why you're super upset too. I think you should probably text your FSIL and explain why it hurt you and that you probably didn't mean to get so upset, but it really hit a painful topic for you. If she isn't an AH, she'll apologize and explain why she's so irritated and you two will make up or at least clear up the air. Don't apologize for getting upset until after she apologizes to you for making the joke.

She said she was jealous you had the time off, which she probably was and doesn't understand how ill some women get, and that it wasn't a picnic for you. I do think she was insensitive, but you should have said I've been really ill with this pregnancy and I am really jealous of you as I would much rather be at work then locked in the bathroom every day.

Then you could have talked it out. Instead she didn't and now she is blaming you for the reaction to her comment. I have a question. Is your due date anywhere near their wedding date?

As someone who is pregnant currently and also had to quit my job due to always having to hug the toilet, I get it.

I can't imagine someone who's supposed to be like family coming over and basically calling me lazy and saying they were jealous I had the grand luck of being able to do nothing all day when I'd prefer to work. That's rubbing salt into already fresh wounds, not to mention I'm assuming OP is still pregnant/barely gave birth if she's still unable to go back to work.

She also joked about how she couldn\u2019t wait to be married so she could do the same.\n\nEven if you ignore all of the pregnancy issue, there is just such a dismissive attitude. The house renovations don\u2019t deserve praise because OP had the time to do it? No one says \u201csit around doing nothing all day\u201d without ill intent, that\u2019s always a negative comment. Then the last comment, that getting married means you\u2019re set. I am not neurotypical, and it has taken me a long time to learn some things, bullying at school hurt and confused me at the same time. But some digs are not that subtle.\n\nBut the real giveaway is that OP has said in a comment that the fianc\u00e9 knows that OP didn\u2019t want to stop working and is sensitive about it.", "Yeah, she knows.

She\u2019s not having the time of her life. My first trimester I was too I\u2019ll to stand. I know the feeling.

She's got raging pregnancy hormones everything is going to make her emotional, when I was pregnant with my first I cried for ten minutes straight because a pen rolled off the table... ridiculous? Yes, but it set me off. She had no control over how her husband would  react and telling someone the reason you won't be joining them for dinner is perfectly reasonable and not \"tattling\".", "What on earth kind of take is this? Are you the fianc\u00e9e?

And if her telling her husband what hurt her makes her an AH, lord save me I'd be dammed because I tell my boyfriend everything. She chose to share what bothered her about someone to her significant other, thats called COMMUNICATION.\n\nSecond, you don't just go around telling someone they \"sit around and do nothing\", that's just basic sense dude. If you fail to see that, well this comment won't make sense anyways.\n\nAlso, props to the in-laws for sticking up for her. She must've realised her words have consequences", "In person, among a couple people? Yeah, digs aren\u2019t jokes. Jokes are funny.

Like if a five-year-old tells you a joke, you might not find it funny, but they were actually trying to tell a joke.

If OP comes over and tells me that she and her FSIL don't get along well anyway, I'll change my judgement", "Yes that is true if you trash talking the host. \n\nBut she just told the truth from her point of view, that OP got to stay home and remodel the house and she could remodel her own house if she could be at home too. It's bad because we know that the OP has been really ill, did she understand that though?\n\nFrom my point of view the reasonable response would be to call her out straight away and say I can assure you I would much rather be at work and not stuck at home sick all the time. It seems OP didn't say anything at all and then the husband went full nuclear, kicking them out and turning the family against her.\n\nWe don't know what the GF would have done if she was called out straight away with a 'come on, that's not called for', she may have apologiesed straight away.

He shouldn't have opened his mouth and should have said \"Why don't we leave so that everyone can calm down and we can talk about this later.\"  When emotions are high, there is no such thing as a \"simple conversation.\"\n\ntagging u/Striking_Ad_6573", "Correct.. OP was oversensitive", "idk the escalation seems a bit much, like i said in another comment, i think OOP was well within her rights to be upset. i don\u2019t really think she\u2019s a full blown ah or anything, that\u2019s why i didn\u2019t add a judgement.", "Right.  Sometimes when I read stuff on my new feed about what \"awful\" things they have to put up with at work, I just laugh.  Sometimes you just have to suck it up and let it go.  \n\nLord knows, I've made insensitive remarks, because I don't know what's going on in other people's heads.  Actually, one of the reasons I read this feed is because a lot of the time I am clueless as to who is the asshole.", "I can see why it hurt OP, but I would still count that as lighthearted ribbing which went wrong. OP should just have told her that the joke hurt and she should have apologized and everyone just went on with their lives. Why all this drama over a mildly insensitive joke?", "The punchline is that it is actually not really jealous because despite getting stuff done that you have put off a long time it is actually not fun to be stuck at home. I feel variations of this joke are pretty common when someone is injured or sick.\n\nEdit: I have no idea if it was a joke or not, hard to tell without knowing the people involved, but it could have been given that I know people who make jokes like that.", "Why are you bringing your personal drama into a conversation that has nothing to do with it lol?", "Schrodinger's joke", "Sometimes losing your shit and telling someone to get the f out of your home is the best response to ensure they never do the same shit again.", "that\u2019s why i didn\u2019t leave a judgement. i think she had every right to be upset. SIL should have thought before she spoke. honestly the husband and sil were the ones in the wrong here, but i can see why some people would say e s h because they thought she was being hormonal and stood by while husband was yelling and blowing things outta proportion. i don\u2019t think bil did anything wrong by saying to calm down, to the average person it is taken as why don\u2019t we have a conversation to talk this out, or leading to asking what happened. the in laws shouldn\u2019t have been roped into the drama because no one, absolutely no one made the decision to have the conversation about the situation after the day it happened. no one else should have been involved before everything was talked about. \n\nsorry if this comes across as snippy or anything i\u2019m just trying to explain my viewpoint of my initial comment \ud83d\ude2d", "SIL didn\u2019t apologize at all. She could start there.", "I'm saying.... That's obviously the point the fiance was making!", "The sock says hello", "They probably will stop if you stop mentioning screaming. It's a cause and effect thing.", "SIL should definitely apologize, but husband and OP are going nuclear and way over the top", "I think I get what you\u2019re saying, dabzilla.  A few of my \u201cjokes\u201d have wildly missed the mark over the decades, but you have to start begging for forgiveness as soon as you see you\u2019ve hurt somebody, start attending to repairing the damage.  I\u2019d wondered if the SIL thought her comments were so nonsensical that they wouldn\u2019t be experienced as attacks, but then she didn\u2019t let up.", "I did, and I explained why I did", "I tend to cool when angry. My GTFO sounds terribly menacing, but it certainly isn't yelling. :)\n\nIt's all bark with me.", "My husband gets so silent when he's really angry. He has never yelled when furious. The words get the fuck out of my house would have been spoken in a clenched teeth kind of way with muscles flexing and hands curling into fists.", "I once told a family member to GTFO without yelling. I was calm and my voice was level as my husband said. You can say it cool and composed because you mean it.", "Again, I interpreted the situation differently. Either way, I still stand by the fact that a civil conversation would have saved a lot of the drama.", "I did the same thing when my mom insulted me in my own damn home. She got so angry with me that she stayed away for 2 blissful days and then 3 more when I thanked her for giving me those 2 days off. Lmfao\nShe lives next door and is always at my home. She has no idea that I let her do that because its my way of keeping an eye on her without her knowing that. She's 84."]}
