After I found out I was pregnant, I was really scared to tell my parents because they are funding my education, and I was worried that they would cut me off as punishment. My then baby daddy (now bf) advised me to hide it, and I thought it was a good idea. So, for the next ten months (after baby's birth) I did not go home and made excuses about having internships, commitments etc.\n\nMy beautiful baby boy was born, and I continued to hide his existence from them for about 6 months, but then realized that it was unfair to HIM. My boyfriend and baby daddy continued to advise ,e not to tell them, as he cannot support us on his own, and we need my parents money so i can complete my education. But I told them anyway.\n\nAs expected, they are extremely angry. My father said I was a disgrace to his family name, and that I am going to hell for my sexual perversions. My mother is not as bad but she has also refused to talk to me, claiming she cannot believe that i hid something of this scale. They are also refusing to see or meet their grandson, and my dad said \"he is no family of ours'.

But it sounds like you've done nothing to ensure that you could introduce your child to them and remain financially secure. \n\nIf I was your BF, I would also be miffed because it sounds like you two cannot afford your little family without financial support from relatives. \n\nYour parents are whatever in this situation. I'm all for cutting out unhealthy and toxic relationships **but** I'm not for making unilateral, reckless decisions in a relationship.", "So your kid was the result of a one night stand? In which case you had no real intention of being with your current bf until after you found out you were pregnant. On top of that, any parent regardless of how religious and strict they are would be super shocked to suddenly find out about the existence of a grandchild. YTA, this is super reckless behavior. You shouldn't expect them to keep paying for your education after all that. Might need to change plans and look for jobs to support yourselves and your kid.", "Look. We know that you aren't a sexual pervert or whatever else your parents called you. But with the exercise of sexual autonomy comes consequences and responsibilities. You wanted to have the freedom and have others pay for it. Your parents are judgemental AHs to be sure. You and your bf decided to accept a responsibility but have your parents pay to continue to support you. You should have told them asap and accepted the fallout. Sorry., ESH.", "YTA for the reasons you withheld telling your parents - \"so they don't cut me off.\"\n\nBy no means am I judging your one night stand, shit happens. I'm sure there are thousands of people who just get lucky and don't wind up with child. \n\nYour parents' reaction is clearly concerning, but at the same time, I could not imagine one of my kids hiding something like that from me. I would be absolutely devastated, and you don't know how they *truly* could've reacted, because you hid it for them for almost a year. \n\nRegardless, you chose to have a baby, you need to take care of him. I hope your number one priority is the baby. Not school. Not your bf.", "YTA that was a very foolish thing to do.\n\nI don't how many years of college you have left but it can't be long.   \n\nYou have made your life and your son'sand bf life infinitely harder.", "YTA not because you had a child but because  you chose to keep the baby knowing you had no resources other than deceit to care for it. It\u2019s a human being not an accessory how are you going to feed and house yourselves? You\u2019re a mother, you\u2019re an adult, your parents have no obligation to care for either of you. Actions have consequences and you chose probably the worse one, hiding for over a year from your parents  Ofcourse they don\u2019t want to help you, you lied. In all those months you could\u2019ve started saving money, applying for aid, looking at resources. But your plan was to \u201cTada!\u201d a baby at your extremely religious parents and what? Expect open arms and acceptance?", "Yta what did you expect?", "YTA: Seriously? You need to ask? You knew how you're parents would react and you have a shock Pikachu moment. You shot yourself in the foot and you know it", "If you cannot support your child, there's always adoption that you could look into. It might sound like a cop out, but I was put up for adoption as a child and depending on the kinds of situations my biological parents were in, it seemed to be the right choice and allowed me to a home of wonderful parents who had trouble having their own child.", "Wait. You betrayed your boyfriend\u2019s trust and put him in a difficult situation??? OP this is YOUR life and YOUR difficult situation. Stop talking like that!!!", "NTA. In fact, I would have continued hiding it from the parents if you're fully financially dependent on them and the threat of them cutting you off is so severe as it is. I would have a proper sitdown with your mother. Explain why you withheld the information and now that you've taken a chance on them, they decide to go the cut-off threat straight away. Focus on the fact that things are as they are now and you all need to move forward in a less-than-ideal situation. Congratulations on your beautiful baby and good luck with your family.", "INFO\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you go on birth control or use any form of protection?", "NTA at first reading this I thought you were just being over cautious. But seeing your parents reaction to the existence of their grandson shows that you were right to be worried. Good parents would want to support their child and be a part of their grandchild\u2019s life. \n\nYour boyfriend is upset, but this situation couldn\u2019t go on forever. Your parents were bound to find out sometime. \n\nIf anything I think it was naive for the both of you to not consider what you were going to do WHEN (not if) your parents discovered this. The issue of financially supporting a child should have been discussed prior to the birth.", "NTA but I would not have told them either, they don't deserve to know your son.", "ESH", "ESH.   \nYour parents deserved honesty from you somewhere in that and far sooner. I know you were scared, but your lying to them has meant you are getting money from them under false pretences. \n\nYour boyfriend is a dick for being angry - this is a complex problem - but he\u2018s scared or worried or something too. \n\nIt sounds like your family is radically awful, so I understand your motives, but you\u2019ve actually betrayed yourself. If they are so awful you can\u2019t talk to them about a child you\u2019ve had, you should work out for yourself to separate off.\n\nLook into financial aid. Start planning to be financially independent. If you want to be separate enough from them that you can hide an entire birthed human, then you should probably cut the financial umbilical cord to and be a proper adult yourself.", "NTA\n\nIt's understandable that you want to be open with your parents.\n\nIs your boyfriend in your side?  It is not his decision to make.\n\nGood luck for the future.", "NTA but your bf is.\n\nOfc you had to tell them, but on the other hand, you could have planned options for different outcomes.\n\nYour bf needs to understand that neither he nor you are entitled to your parents' money, they give it if they like. It would be an AH move to lie to them to get their money from them. Him expecting you to hide your child from hsi grandparents in order to leech their money makes him the AH.\n\nYes, you should have told them earlier, but you can't change history. It is understandable that your mother is upset. You really need to apologize to her and when she is ready, share pictures and videos of him as a baby. \n\nIt sounds like you are only now starting to grasp your role as a parent, and you did the right thing for your child by telling his grandparents about him. What your parents do now is not up to you, and you can only do your part, which you have done.\n\nYour bf needs to step up and plan how you both as a family can support the family. He should never have expected your parents to support you, what kind of a father expects his gf's parents to pay for everything?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
