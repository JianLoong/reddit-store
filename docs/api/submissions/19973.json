Cook, clean and do your own laundry, all without being told by someone else.\n2. Make a budget and live within its means.\n3. Say no to goofing off with friends.\n4. Get yourself up in the morning, get to school yourself, and get yourself in bed at a regular time.\n5. Interact with your teachers at school, getting feedback on your grades and where you need to improve.\n6. Take the initiative to get your driver's license\n7. Get a part time job.\n\nIn other words, be your own parent of yourself and be a strict one at that.\n\nMost college prof's don't care if you show up to the class or do the work and are happy to fail you and will not warn you if you are doing badly.  You will be 100% on your own, you will be taught only if you show up to learn and do the work.  There will be lots of temptation to not go to class, to sleep in, and to party too much.", "Whoa NTA. Your parents have done a massive disservice to your personal growth and development by being so restrictive. \n\nLet me tell you a story about my overprotective parents, my mother never let me out. She gingerly started allowing me to go see friends, let alone go out, when I was 14, and that had to be massively supervised. My father died when I was 14, and mother died when I was 15. I had to learn everything about living on my own, taking care of myself, and social interaction the hard way. \n\nWhat happened that your parents are so restrictive? I discovered after mine died it was family secrets they didn\u2019t want me to find out (half siblings from a previous marriage who they didn\u2019t want me to know).", "NTA\n\nYou certainly are old enough to stay home alone. I doubt they want your sister to babysit you, more like be around if there's a fire or something. One week is a long time. Ask them to try this over a weekend first!", "Hey sweetie! \ud83d\udc96 I completely understand how you're feeling. It seems like you're in a tough situation, wanting to prove your maturity and prepare for university, but feeling held back by your parents' rules. I can see why you'd feel that it's unfair, especially when comparing how they treat your sister. It's okay to voice your feelings, that doesn't make you an asshole, it makes you someone who's trying to grow.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, based on what you've said, it sounds...unlikely that your parents are likely to give you the freedom you want, and even though I completely agree you're in the right, continuing to confront them on this is unlikely to resolve anything and will likely only cause further argument at this point (since you obviously presented your concerns maturely in the past and they dismissed it). This can be frustrating, but all I believe you can really do here is bite the bullet and concede where you have to, maybe you can make the best of it by getting along with your sister better where possible. We don't always have power over whether a situation is fair or just, but we do have power over how we respond to them, without many alternatives, you can make things easier on yourself by giving your parents what they want without compromising your position on this issue. \n\n\r\rRemember, even if you feel stuck right now, this isn't forever, it's just a moment in time. Soon you'll be off to university, living independently, and all this will be a distant memory. Just hang in there, okay? Sending you all the love and positive vibes! \ud83d\udc95\"", "NTA, but you're likely paying the price for your older sister's antics. You made a good case, they said no. You tried again. They said no. If you keep pushing, you WILL be whiney, so just assume you'll be fine when you get to college and let this go. Also, if your sister suggests doing something stupid when your parents are away, don't go along with it.", "NTA for wanting to stay home alone, especially if it was something like what your older sister was allowed to do.\n\nUsually parents are more *strict* with the first child. It is curious they are more strict with *you*.\n\nWhen you go to university, you can do what you want. Make sure your university is far enough away from your parents that you will be unable to live with them, (awww, so sad you can\u2019t stay home) (s).\n\nYour time will come.", "NTA, Your parents don't see you as a person worth discussing things with. Since you can't treat this as practice, treat it like vacation. Spend as much time as possible out of the house, make plans to do things/stay with friends.\n\nPetty: Do no household chores.", "NAH\n\nYou're not the asshole for *wanting* to, but I also see your parents' point. \n\nStaying home absolutely alone is not *quite* the same thing as being at university, where there are roommates, housemates, wardens, student residence advisors, etc. \n\nAnd even putting personal safety aside, if something goes wrong in the house, it's better to have an adult there who can pay for repairs. \n\nWhen I was your age(ish):\n\n* I still had to stay at my grandparent's house when my parents went away during the school term. I didn't mind much; it saved me from having to cook my own meals (and they actually lived closer to my school than I did). \n* When my parents left my sister (17) and me (15) alone in the house unsupervised, my sister threw a *huge* party. We were lucky that destruction was minimal\u2014there was *some*, but a lot less than other \"parents are away\" parties we attended.\n* When I was left alone during the summer, something went wrong in the house. I had no way to pay for a repair, so I had to suffer through it until my parents returned.", "Lol, no.\n\nNTA\n\nit is unfair, you are the baby of the family, and your parents ain't gonna let that go for as long as they can.\n\nYou already know you the baby of the family. Hahaha. Oh well... it's a good problem to have", "NTA, 17 is definitely old enough and some experience of being alone would benefit you. We have facetime, so your parents could check daily on you if they're worried", "NTA. \n\nAs someone who is also going to University soon, you should get the experience. I\u2019m an only child and was able to stay home alone around 5th grade. But the first time I was allowed overnight by myself was in the last 6 months, so 17-18. Getting that experience, especially for a few days in my case, was super valuable. I\u2019m going to school overseas and will be completely without my parents support (for chores, cooking, etc.) and will need to get around on my own (which I am downright awful at), and your parents should understand that you need that experience, especially in an area you are comfortable with. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that your parents haven\u2019t been able to see your responsibility and without causing a fight, I wonder if talking to your sister may be the best option?", "NTA but I am assuming your older sibling hasn't given a good impression for living alone given your parents aren't discriminatory by default. You can change their mind in this case by displaying a good sense.\nIf the case is otherwise, I don't want to say it but you will have to deal with it a bit longer till you go for college. They will keep calling you whiny if you insist again and again.", "NAH I get where you are coming from, but I also get your parents wanting to have a legal adult around while they are out of the country. Don\u2019t view it as babysitting, view it as having a roommate.", "Nta. They probably were burned by leaving your older sister alone at that age so hence this reaction. You\u2019ll be 18 and hopefully away at college soon. \nDepends on the kid, sounds like you\u2019d be responsible, but there\u2019s always emergencies that can occur. \nMy son was definitely ok to leave for a week at your age and actually younger/never had any issues, but the few times we were very far geographically we\u2019d definitely have close neighbors on standby (relatives are far away), and we\u2019d be in communication with him ourselves. \nShoot he was piloting airplanes at 17.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is ridiculous.

I really do understand where you're coming from. I also experienced a similarly restrictive environment growing up, so your feelings resonate with me. There's nothing immature about wanting to grow and explore beyond the confines of your current situation - it's a natural part of life. It may be difficult at times now, but once you move on, you'll have the opportunity to experience more freedom. What aspect of university life are you most looking forward to? \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA, and damn, your parents sound super overprotective of you.  17 is old enough to stay home alone IMO. You sound like a mature and level headed person . If your sister's irresponsible, they probably feel like they gave her too much freedom but now they're taking that out on you by not giving you much of any.  If you're going away to University next year it's only a difference of a few months at this point.   That said, I do think they should have an actual responsible adult as an emergency contact for you in case something happens that's out of your control.\n\nI know things are a bit different today (this was in the early 90s), but my sister and I were allowed to stay home alone for 4 days when we were 15 and 14.  I'm the oldest, but we weren't completely alone since they had our next door neighbor pop in to check in on us a few  times a day and she was right there if anything went wrong.  We knew her very well too of course.  But overnights, we were alone.", "NTA. I guess your paying for your sisters sins. Sorry. Don't worry your parents will moan in a few years about how you and your sister treat them differently and you will stare at them in a WTF way and they still won't get it and tell you to forget the past.", "NTA and 17 is old enough to stay alone where I live (USA).", "NTA.  It's a case of hypocrisy.  They let your sister have all these freedoms and demanded to have the irresponsible one to babysit one who's practically an adult in die time.  If your sister did whatever at a younger age than you did, then surely they'd treat the kids equally after with precautions.  Instead, by their lack of parenting on the irresponsible sibling, they isolated the younger sibling.  You're on your way to college and proven to be more of an adult than your sister and still your parents don't agree? Yeah, your NTA.", "NTA but it seems like they see they raised your sister wrong and are now trying to make up for it by being overly strict with you. hang in there you only have about a year or so before you will be out of their house where you will be able to spread your wings and fly just dont be dumb and go too crazy after being suppressed for so long", "NAH. I understand where your coming from, but I am sure your parents want your sister to look after the house as well as you. \n\nBeing in Uni away from home isn\u2019t much like actually living alone as chances are you\u2019ll never actually be living alone during your time in Uni (too expensive!).", "NTA \n\nYour basically an adult at this point for gosh sakes.", "I don\u2019t want to call you TA, but I think you shouldn\u2019t press on this. Your parents were clearly overprotective in the past, but this particular instance is pretty standard. Most parents don\u2019t want to leave their minor children alone for a week. It depends on the kind of supervision they want for you, but it\u2019s pretty reasonable for them to want your adult sister to stay in the house with you. It would be different if they were leaving her in charge to boss you around, but if she\u2019s just an available legal adult that\u2019s normal and reasonable.", "Pfft. I moved out at 17.

It wasn't a trust issue with me, it was a legal thing. I couldn't seek medical care for myself if something happened. I had to have someone over 18 taking care. Maybe that's your parents reasoning?", "NAH. Of course you want autonomy, that's developmentally appropriate. Have you considered their rules are more strict for you because they learned their lesson from being too lenient with your sister?", "NTA are you sure they\u2019re not making her babysit to teach HER responsibility lol? But definitely seems like a case of overcompensation for how they raised her.", "They overcorrected, thinking they're helping you. They continue with the overcorrection because they're seeing a better daughter.", "NAH\n\nYou want to stay home alone and you're old enough to do so, but if they aren't comfortable with you staying home alone it's also their right to have someone come over to their home while they're gone.", "NTA just before I went to uni, my dad told me he was booking a holiday and it would cost me \u00a3600.
