If you are doing this merely for your career, it seems to be a minor issue at best and counter-productive at worst.\n\nIt seems far more likely that you are not going to see him because you have a bad relationship, because you are mad at him for this crime, or because you are disgusted by it.  Any of these are legitimate reasons not to go, but solely looking at the career-based reason, yes YTA.", "YTA\n\nTo be honest people like you really get under my skin. The fact that you're willing to put your reputation above someone you seemingly care about is just gross. From what I've gathered in the comments, the crime wasn't something incredibly foul or unforgivable, if it was I'd understand your desire to not go. \n\nAt the end of the day, I can't picture too many scenarios where you going to visit someone in prison would affect your career. It's nobody's business what you do outside of work hours. You don't abandon the people you care about when they are at their lowest, it's a grimy thing to do. \n\nI've had a few friends in prison, their experiences were beyond unpleasant for a multitude of reasons. Most of it being mistreatment from staff. But something as simple as answering the phone when they called, or writing them a letter meant the world. I did this for a friend several years ago, he still talks about it to this day. Yes your father made a mistake, but he's already being punished.", "Info: how long is his sentence? And second why would visiting someone in prison affect your career opportunities? You committed no crimes, why would you be judged for visiting your father?", "YTA, not because you are wrong to value career where it conflicts with family, but because you are setting up a false premise.\n\nWhy would visiting him harm your career? If people need to see you as \"somebody they can trust\", hiding the situation is only going to make you look more untrustworthy. Visit him openly, and there is no news story. \n\nIf you career is public-facing to the degree that visiting would harm you, the mere fact of him being there will eventually become public as well.", "I'm going to say a mild YTA. There are definitely circumstances where having a reputation as the son of a criminal might hurt you, but those are in small towns where everyone would already know that anyway. Now that he's already arrested you physically visiting probably won't change much, and to be frank a lot of people would find the opposite - they would trust you less if they found out you refused to visit a loved one for career reasons.\n\nThat said, maybe you have other reasons for not visiting your father. Maybe you don't want to see him that way, or you're fed up with his criminal choices. Those are fair, if harsh. But if you do care about him, it is a difficult time, and I don't think your career reasons really hold water.", "I don\u2019t know, something about this seems really weird.

Or do you mean the prison staff?", "YTA! You're probably from the us right? First I Don't get how visiting him makes you a bad person. If anything it makes you better, because you care for him. Secondly if anyone cares about that one situation you visited a family member in prison, the person already knows about him being there, which will certainly be a bigger deal for them in the first place.", "YTA.\n\nIf you wanted to stop talking to your father for another reason, it could've been fine. But this just seems cold.\n\nNot to mention, it's more likely than not in a \"public-facing career\" that people will learn about your dad either way. And then you have to explain why you left him high and dry. In any case, cold and calculating.", "YTA. You come across as image obsessed and self aggrandizing and that\u2019s probably more damaging long term.", "INFO: I don't understand how it's that different if people know that your father is in prison vs. if they know you're visiting him there.

Im not sure about this. \n\nImo, in the unlikely event that someone visiting the prison recognizes you, they are unlikely to publicize the fact. \n\nAlso, there are a whole bunch of cover stories you could use. You are an outreach worker or volunteer of some kind.\n\nAnd why should your fathers behaviour reflect on you?\n\nIt may be that it makes you seem compassionate rather than whatever you are worried about.\n\nIm gonna go with NAH. He is your father, you must do what you think is right. I still think you are overstating the possible problems this will cause you though.", "NTA, And this may sound harsh, but if your father did commit the crime then that's on him.

Not really enough info to make a decision and this is super complex.\n\nIf you weren't visiting because you no longer supported him due to the nature of his crime then that's NTA whatsoever. However your other comments suggest he committed a non violent crime and has a relatively short sentence, so this is not something that severe. If you have a relationship with him and love him and support him as a person and a father, then you should visit him. I'm leaning towards YTA but went NAH in the end (as I'm not sure who the asshole would be, perhaps the dirt diggers I guess)\n\nAnyone who cares about digging up dirt on you will know your father is in prison. I don't see how visiting them makes that big a difference. Supporting a relative in prison is not supporting the crime they committed.  If these dirt diggers really have it in for you they will know you still have a relationship with your dad when he gets out anyway. You could spin supporting a relative in prison as supporting rehabilitation whilst still having a relationship with someone who raised you and presumably, that you love.\n\nIn my opinion you'd be better off getting ahead of this not trying to hide it. There's plenty of ways to spin this into you having positive actions whilst still having a relationship with him.", "INFO: who is going to see you visiting that is going to affect your career? Short of you applying for a job in the Prison, everyone else seeing you there is presumably doing exactly what you're doing.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re being too vague here, so you totally hiding some detail that will make you clearly TA.  \n\nYou probably should explain your career and the crime to give real context to the dilemma.

And this is from someone who's biological father was in jail for drug charges and theft. I'm not proud of what he did but those were his crimes, not mine.

Being willing to abandon a family member due to appearances is not a commendble thing to do.\n\nBut purely from a practical perspective, like others have said, it will come out.

It wasnt murder or a sexual offence - you said it wasnt violent in nature.\n\nThe person is being punished and serving their time - the whole point of prison is that someone repays their debt to society, is punished and gets rehabilitated.   Do you not agree with that? Should any criminal no matter the crime even white collar crime just be shot and never be allowed to learn and move on and change their life?\n\nShould people who have been to prison not be allowed to work every again etc? If you have a public facing role - your public also includes former prisoners, they are part of society too.\n\nYou didnt stand up in court in defend him, you didnt say he should not be in prison. Your stance is he did the crime and he must pay for it. But it doesnt stop the person being your family, it doesnt stop you visiting them, helping them when they come out so they dont fall in to the same pattern? Thats not condoning crime and its not empathising. Thats being human. If you cant be a human being then you shouldnt be in this public facing job.  Visiting someone serving time showing empathy. Its someone visiting a human who has been found guilty, is being rehabilitated and punished and checking in on their father - who is not the sum of his crimes. How does someone get rehabilitated if everyone cuts them from their life?\n\nBiden has a kid who has done all sorts, he never stepped away-  and he never condoned his actions.   He is still his father, he can say the actions are bad, but if you leave someone and cut them out - then there is no chance they get better. It makes you inhuman.
