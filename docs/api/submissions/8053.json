If you are doing this merely for your career, it seems to be a minor issue at best and counter-productive at worst.\n\nIt seems far more likely that you are not going to see him because you have a bad relationship, because you are mad at him for this crime, or because you are disgusted by it.  Any of these are legitimate reasons not to go, but solely looking at the career-based reason, yes YTA.", "YTA\n\nTo be honest people like you really get under my skin. The fact that you're willing to put your reputation above someone you seemingly care about is just gross. From what I've gathered in the comments, the crime wasn't something incredibly foul or unforgivable, if it was I'd understand your desire to not go. \n\nAt the end of the day, I can't picture too many scenarios where you going to visit someone in prison would affect your career. It's nobody's business what you do outside of work hours. You don't abandon the people you care about when they are at their lowest, it's a grimy thing to do. \n\nI've had a few friends in prison, their experiences were beyond unpleasant for a multitude of reasons. Most of it being mistreatment from staff. But something as simple as answering the phone when they called, or writing them a letter meant the world. I did this for a friend several years ago, he still talks about it to this day. Yes your father made a mistake, but he's already being punished.", "Info: how long is his sentence? And second why would visiting someone in prison affect your career opportunities? You committed no crimes, why would you be judged for visiting your father?", "YTA, not because you are wrong to value career where it conflicts with family, but because you are setting up a false premise.\n\nWhy would visiting him harm your career? If people need to see you as \"somebody they can trust\", hiding the situation is only going to make you look more untrustworthy. Visit him openly, and there is no news story. \n\nIf you career is public-facing to the degree that visiting would harm you, the mere fact of him being there will eventually become public as well.", "I'm going to say a mild YTA. There are definitely circumstances where having a reputation as the son of a criminal might hurt you, but those are in small towns where everyone would already know that anyway. Now that he's already arrested you physically visiting probably won't change much, and to be frank a lot of people would find the opposite - they would trust you less if they found out you refused to visit a loved one for career reasons.\n\nThat said, maybe you have other reasons for not visiting your father. Maybe you don't want to see him that way, or you're fed up with his criminal choices. Those are fair, if harsh. But if you do care about him, it is a difficult time, and I don't think your career reasons really hold water.", "I don\u2019t know, something about this seems really weird. You don\u2019t want to see your dad because it could ruin your \u201ccareer prospects\u201d who are you expecting to run into at a prison? Or who are you expecting to be waiting there for you and watching you? \n\nIf he didn\u2019t do a violent crime or anything sexual in nature (which you haven\u2019t been clear about) then I\u2019m not sure what the big deal is, only because why can\u2019t these supposed important career prospects figure out critical thinking in the sense that seeing your father doesn\u2019t mean you condone his actions? Considering he\u2019s in prison? It\u2019s not like you helped him avoid prosecution. It\u2019s a visit? I don\u2019t know something is super off about this", "INFO: what crime did he commit?", "Depends on the crime, anything that is assault related especially a life ending yeah ok avoid. But the only thing that really hurts your career prospects today, of all things, is your social media history.", "INFO: who exactly do you think is going to _see_ you, if you visit? Or do you mean the prison staff?", "YTA! You're probably from the us right? First I Don't get how visiting him makes you a bad person. If anything it makes you better, because you care for him. Secondly if anyone cares about that one situation you visited a family member in prison, the person already knows about him being there, which will certainly be a bigger deal for them in the first place.", "YTA.\n\nIf you wanted to stop talking to your father for another reason, it could've been fine. But this just seems cold.\n\nNot to mention, it's more likely than not in a \"public-facing career\" that people will learn about your dad either way. And then you have to explain why you left him high and dry. In any case, cold and calculating.", "YTA. You come across as image obsessed and self aggrandizing and that\u2019s probably more damaging long term.", "INFO: I don't understand how it's that different if people know that your father is in prison vs. if they know you're visiting him there. Wouldn't they know your father is in prison whether or not you visit him? Does this have something to do with your specific career?", "Personally mate, I think it will look worse if people find out your father is serving time and you basically abandonned him to save face. \n\nThat honestly will make you come accross as untrustworthy and unloyal.\n\nYTA, go visit your dad.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nEgo over family? \n\nUnless you just secretly hate your Dad or actually don't want to see him.", "Hmm. Im not sure about this. \n\nImo, in the unlikely event that someone visiting the prison recognizes you, they are unlikely to publicize the fact. \n\nAlso, there are a whole bunch of cover stories you could use. You are an outreach worker or volunteer of some kind.\n\nAnd why should your fathers behaviour reflect on you?\n\nIt may be that it makes you seem compassionate rather than whatever you are worried about.\n\nIm gonna go with NAH. He is your father, you must do what you think is right. I still think you are overstating the possible problems this will cause you though.", "NTA, And this may sound harsh, but if your father did commit the crime then that's on him. If you feel its in your best interest to not visit then don't visit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not really enough info to make a decision and this is super complex.\n\nIf you weren't visiting because you no longer supported him due to the nature of his crime then that's NTA whatsoever. However your other comments suggest he committed a non violent crime and has a relatively short sentence, so this is not something that severe. If you have a relationship with him and love him and support him as a person and a father, then you should visit him. I'm leaning towards YTA but went NAH in the end (as I'm not sure who the asshole would be, perhaps the dirt diggers I guess)\n\nAnyone who cares about digging up dirt on you will know your father is in prison. I don't see how visiting them makes that big a difference. Supporting a relative in prison is not supporting the crime they committed.  If these dirt diggers really have it in for you they will know you still have a relationship with your dad when he gets out anyway. You could spin supporting a relative in prison as supporting rehabilitation whilst still having a relationship with someone who raised you and presumably, that you love.\n\nIn my opinion you'd be better off getting ahead of this not trying to hide it. There's plenty of ways to spin this into you having positive actions whilst still having a relationship with him.", "INFO: who is going to see you visiting that is going to affect your career? Short of you applying for a job in the Prison, everyone else seeing you there is presumably doing exactly what you're doing.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re being too vague here, so you totally hiding some detail that will make you clearly TA.  \n\nYou probably should explain your career and the crime to give real context to the dilemma.  Otherwise you aren\u2019t going to get quality feedback from Reddit.", "YWBTA. It's kind of shallow to think of your career before family. And this is from someone who's biological father was in jail for drug charges and theft. I'm not proud of what he did but those were his crimes, not mine. Just like your father's crimes are his own, not yours.", "I think YTA. If you're that public facing, people will find out. \n\nI can't imagine why people would care. I can't imagine any public facing job where it would matter what your family did. You are not your father.", "It\u2019s not your responsibility to visit him in prison.       \nHe put himself there.       \nBut your excuses are BS.       \nJust admit to yourself (and us) you don\u2019t want to go see him there.", "YTA and you're making an excuse. It has nothing to do with career prospects, you just don't want to visit him. Gross.", "Info: Does he have other family members who are visiting him or are you the only active person in his immediate family?", "YTA imagine how much worse it would be for a public figure to be outed as shallow, vapid and callous, and cut of family just because of image.", "Mild YTA. Being willing to abandon a family member due to appearances is not a commendble thing to do.\n\nBut purely from a practical perspective, like others have said, it will come out. You just have to decide which would be less damaging:\n\n\"Low-Feedback abandoned his father in prison.\"  \n\"Low-Feedback's hidden criminal family history revealed.\"\n\nor\n\n\"Low-Feedback continued to support his father after <insert crime here>.\"", "If your job involves extensive background checks, is high profile, or public facing, people already know it or will know soon enough.  Then you're the person who tried to hide it. \n\nIf you job is a lot more low key, but involves moral integrity, like if you are a minister in a small church, you should find that people value loyalty, family, empathy, and redemption.", "YWBTA.  If you are so famous that randoms will see you at the prison and go \u201chey, there\u2019s famous person\u201d, then people will already know that your father is in prison.  \n\nIf people you already know will see you at the prison, then they already know your father is in prison.  \n\nIf you hope to be famous or at least notable in the future, the media will dig into your background and find that your father is/has been in prison. \n\nPeople already know or will know. None of your prospective future employers are watching CCTV of prison visitors all around your country marking people as unemployable just because they visited a friend or relative in prison. \n\nIf you are ashamed of or angry at your father, then own those feelings instead of coming up with this strange justification for not visiting.", "YTA.

But then regardless of this, if the press want to sniff out a story on a person, they will, regardless of whether there is contact or not. \n\nYTA OP, and tbh I wouldn't want a public servant like you acting in my interest because you seem intent on not attempting to reintegrate offenders into society, which is a HUGE part of ensuring that they don't reoffend.", "\ud83d\udc4f", "I agree.  There are missing details.  This person shouldn\u2019t ask AITA if they can\u2019t give proper context", "I'd rather not be too specific but it was not violent in nature. Not his first offense but his first time in prison.", "If I am seen to condone or empathize with his behaviour it could affect how I am perceived.", "Why would visiting a family member be condoning the crime? It wasnt murder or a sexual offence - you said it wasnt violent in nature.\n\nThe person is being punished and serving their time - the whole point of prison is that someone repays their debt to society, is punished and gets rehabilitated.   Do you not agree with that? Should any criminal no matter the crime even white collar crime just be shot and never be allowed to learn and move on and change their life?\n\nShould people who have been to prison not be allowed to work every again etc? If you have a public facing role - your public also includes former prisoners, they are part of society too.\n\nYou didnt stand up in court in defend him, you didnt say he should not be in prison. Your stance is he did the crime and he must pay for it. But it doesnt stop the person being your family, it doesnt stop you visiting them, helping them when they come out so they dont fall in to the same pattern? Thats not condoning crime and its not empathising. Thats being human. If you cant be a human being then you shouldnt be in this public facing job.  Visiting someone serving time showing empathy. Its someone visiting a human who has been found guilty, is being rehabilitated and punished and checking in on their father - who is not the sum of his crimes. How does someone get rehabilitated if everyone cuts them from their life?\n\nBiden has a kid who has done all sorts, he never stepped away-  and he never condoned his actions.   He is still his father, he can say the actions are bad, but if you leave someone and cut them out - then there is no chance they get better. It makes you inhuman. Even judges have kids in prison or who've gone up in court. The job is not the person.\n\nAnd if you are in politics -then you dont represent just people who havent committed crimes, who have never been to prison - you represent them too", "What kind of career are you talking about though, are you looking into being a politician or some kind of public responsibility, or are you hoping to be some kind of celebrity or influencer type ? Or are you in something like financials or the face of a company ?\n\nEither way, go visit your dad, not doing so will get around as soon as someone wanting to damage you finds out, and you will be \"asshole who was trying to hide his shameful family secret\" type thing.  Unless his crime is something that you would disown him for either way.", "Yeah, NTA. He committed a violent crime.", "But you said what he done wasn\u2019t violent in nature, so what was it then?", "Well, visiting him doesn't necessarily mean you condone his behavior, and some people might well think you're not empathetic enough if you never visit your own father. You can't really control what people will think or how they might judge you, so you might just want to go with what you want to do.", "It wasn\u2019t violent in nature op said", "How did you get 'violent crime' from OP saying 'not violent in nature'? That is like night and day."]}
