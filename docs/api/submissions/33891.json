I feel terrible for her, but I was never close to her growing up. We grew up in different countries. \n\nI\u2019m getting married in March 2024. My aunt came over two weeks ago to discuss something. She wants me to let my cousin walk down the aisle with her dad before I walk. I don\u2019t feel comfortable with this because, yes, it\u2019s sad that she won\u2019t get to experience this, but isn\u2019t it my day to shine? \n\nMy aunt says that I\u2019m being selfish for not doing this. She spoke to my parents about this, and they don\u2019t seem too happy. My in-laws are not pleased too. But they still want me to decide. My fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t feel\ncomfortable too. \n\nMy aunt brought my cousin to my place to discuss it last week. Cousin cried, saying she wanted to walk down the aisle and that I should let her. I told her it was my wedding day, so it was not right for her to take over. She then called me selfish and a bridezilla for not caring about her. Like I said, we were never close, so I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s trying to do this on my wedding day. I told her I needed more time to think, so She\u2019s on IG posting cryptic stuff, obviously attacking me. \n\nI talked to my friends for non-biased opinions, and they were divided. Some want me to allow her to walk down the aisle because she would never get to experience that, and I\u2019ll be doing something nice.

Aunt can throw her daughter her own pseudo wedding day party type thing if she wants instead of stealing yours", "NTA. It's a weird request, honestly. I've never heard of anyone doing something like that. It's really sad that she's dying and will not get married, but... she still won't? I don't know. Maybe her parents should throw her a party or something.", "NTA.    Your wedding, your choice.   Unless you're just doing it to be an AH, which obviously you aren't.      It's terribly sad that she is dying!   but that doesn't give her the right to walk down the aisle at YOUR wedding.   if her mother is so adamant that she does so, maybe she should renew her own vows in a church and have her daughter walk then.", "NTA I\u2019m kind of flabbergasted they even asked this of anyone, let alone a cousin they\u2019re not close with. I\u2019m truly sympathetic to your cousin\u2019s situation, but this is totally out of line. What\u2019s next? Will she also want to wear something bridal and carry a bouquet so she can really have the wedding experience?", "Nta. Univite your cousin and aunt and hire security.", "Nta \nSo werid they even asked ans what's more werid is that she wants to go first \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if u aloud it why can't she walk down the isle after your wedding ceremony is done and just have ur family there \nIt's so fucken weird she wants to do it with your fiance family there \n\nBut not the asshole at all such a weird request", "Very odd, wouldn\u2019t it be much worse for her to walk down the aisle with no one waiting for her? Won\u2019t there be lots of sad tears (as opposed to happy ones)? NTA", "NTA.  It\u2019s certainly terrible that your cousin has leukemia and may/won\u2019t get to experience her own wedding, but I can\u2019t imagine thinking it\u2019s ok to just overshadow someone else\u2019s wedding.  It really wasn\u2019t an appropriate request at all.", "NTA for saying no and honestly tell them it\u2019s crazy they even would ask that! Tell them neither your fianc\u00e9 nor you want that and if they continue they can stay home since they find you so selfish to want to enjoy YOUR OWN DAMN WEDDING! And tell your friends that they can let her walk down their weddings lol", "NTA. This is crazy. If your aunt wants her daughter to be escorted like a bride down the aisle on her father's arm - I suggest she hire event space for that sole purpose. What is with this piggyback your wedding routine? Who will explain to your guests that they will be staging a mock wedding before your actual wedding? Who will get permission from the officiant if you marry in a church?\n\nNone of this makes sense to me. Just don't do it.", "JFC NTA. That demand is just ridiculous. They can take her to Vegas if she wants to walk down an aisle.", "NTA, her family should organize something for her that everyone can feel sorry for her and ohhh and ahhh for her. Not on your day unless you are really besties and this is something you really want to do.", "NTA. If your cousin wants to walk down the aisle, let her aunt book a church herself. No need to hijack your ceremony.", "I have a feeling if you allowed her to do that, she\u2019d show up in a wedding dress. NTA.", "No you would not be the asshole if you say no.  They can have an event of some sort that involves your cousin walking down the aisle on a day that's all for her.  It doesnt need to be your wedding day.", "NTA. Let her family plan their own celebration of her life where she can be the center of attention.", "NTA.\n\nWhat is she walking towards? There's no partner at the other end, there's no one for her dad to \"give her away\" to... by your post and the fact that she's so focused on the \"fact\" that she'll never get married, I'm gonna assume she's single- she needs to stop focusing on the marriage she doesn't have and start focusing on enjoying her own company in the time she does have left. \n\nThis request (and I'm using that word generously, since your aunt and cousin have made it clear that it was far more of a demand) is weird as hell, and you are 100% within your moral rights to say, \"with respect, fuck no.\"\n\nIt's not her day. She doesn't get to be the center of attention, she doesn't get to do the things the bride does, and she doesn't get to try and guilt-trip you for saying no. \n\n\"Cousin, I'm sorry about what you're going through. But my empathy doesn't extend to going against the wishes of myself, my fiance, and both our families in order to give you this experience... Considering you'd be walking to the altar where *my* fiance is waiting for *me*, asking feels uncomfortable on so many levels- and your tactics to try and convince me feel cheap and tacky. Please don't ask again, I'm not going to change my mind.\"\n\n...I'd be fully prepared for her to wear white to the wedding. Or for her to try and spill something on your dress.", "NTA", "NTA - I get it, your cousin's situation sucks, but they are coopting your wedding because it's the nearest one that they can. If there was a more convenient wedding, they would probably do the same there.  It's fine to ask, it's not ok to demand. You made your choice (which is a totally valid and ok choice) and if they can't respect that then they never respected you or your wedding to begin with.", "Nta. imagine how confused your guests would be when the wrong bride walks down the isle.", "Shame on your aunt for encouraging your cousin in this bizarre and morbid request. They are the epitome of self indulgence to tinge your wedding by putting a spot light on your cousin\u2019s imminent death. \n\nEncourage your aunt and cousin to celebrate your cousin\u2019s  life at a different event that is all about her and not to hijack your celebration.  \n\nNTA and it sounds like your fianc\u00e9 and families are uncomfortable with this too. Say no and please do not let them pull you into a debate.", "The Answer is NO \u2026 sorry she\u2019s sick but it\u2019s NO", "YTA because I am pretty sure this is a repost and I read it some time ago with the exact same wording.", "That is an extremely strange request.  She wants the experience of walking down the aisle, but for what?  There's no groom waiting for her at the altar.  There's no happy ever after.  If anything, it would make her more depressed about her life, because it would be a completely empty gesture.\n\nYour aunt should have a celebration of life party for her, where she does get to shine, where she gets to wear a pretty dress and have people focus on her.  Your wedding is not the place or time for that.\n\nNTA", "NTA and your family is really bizarre for even asking. It\u2019s your wedding \u2014 if they want to have an event where she can walk down the aisle and pretend she\u2019s getting married they can have an event like that. But I think it\u2019s really sick and bizarre to even ask. Stand your ground!", "NAH. That\u2019s a really sad request, like walking down the aisle would be some kinda dream come true SMH\n\nThen again, I don\u2019t think a sickly cousin would be stealing your limelight, so why not \ud83e\udd37\n\nIt would be hella confusing for the guests tho.", "YWNBTA\n\nWhat is happening to your cousin is exceedingly sad, I get that.\n\nBut this is your wedding day, both you and your Fianc\u00e9 are uncomfortable with this. Your Parents and soon to be in laws are not happy with it.\n\nIn your words \"isn\u2019t it my day to shine?\"\n\nThis has to be a firm No!", "NTA. I hope your fiance at least is completely supportive of whatever decision you come to.\n\nThat's not to say it wouldn't be a hugely magnanimous gesture for you to make, but shame on your aunt for putting you on the spot.\n\nYou will be out of the aunt's will, of course. You shouldn't be mercenary about this but it's a foreseeable outcome.", "NTA.\n\nWhy can't they do this on any day other than your wedding day?\n\nRent out a church or venue and have them do this. Invite the rest of the family even. \n\nWhy do they have to hijack your wedding?", "Nta I feel like your family could hold a party for her so she can walk down an aisle  but it\u2019s inappropriate to make your SO be standing there. \n\nIf I was him I would be so uncomfortable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is cruelly selfish of them force this on you for their own desires.", "Is she just asking to walk down the aisle the same way some of the bridesmaids and groomsmen might or the flower girl does?", "I don't want to sound cruel but i think there's a good chance this problem will solve itself out", "NTA. However devastating her life expectancy may be, how grim the future may look, this request is insane.\n\nThe logistics alone - so she'd wear a wedding dress right? Would she request that they play the wedding march or a particular song? What would they *do* at the altar? He wouldn't *give her away* to someone, because she's got no groom waiting for her. Would *your* wedding party be there? Would she have her own? Would the priest (or officiant, whatever) have to play a part in this theater play? Would she, in her wedding dress, sit down at the front and stare at you in your *actual* wedding, with an *actual* groom?\n\nThe *sentiment* I get, but when you start to think about it's too much. Which I'm sure *is* what they're experiencing right now, however, they're not giving you and your, to be blunt, actual wedding would be like.\n\nReal talk, have you given any consideration to eloping or having a teeny tiny private ceremony, *then* a bigger reception?

This is total crap and you are well in your rights to say no. Cause once you say yes, she will need to be in a wedding dress cause she will never get to wear one, and she will need her favourite flower bouquet cause she is walking down the aisle, and she will need to hear her toasts at the reception cause her friends will never get to do them, and she will need input on the food as she has her favourites etc etc where will it end?\n\nAnd anyone who thinks otherwise can pay for a chapel and plan a fake wedding for her to walk down the aisle, and then what? She stands there by herself? Ridiculous! I totally get someone dying young (as my sister did) but wtf this is a crazy ass request.", "The more I think about it, the more I think the aunt is being cheap, she doesn't want the cost of the invites/meal/location/decor.  So much easier to just use OP's wedding!"]}
