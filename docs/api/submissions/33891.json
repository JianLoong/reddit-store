It will feel hollow and may even make her feel worse.  She will quickly realize that walking down the aisle in a church full of people wearing a wedding dress with no groom waiting is just sad.  \n\nYour wedding is not the appropriate place for this.  If they are determined then she can invite all her friends and family to watch her walk down the aisle of a decorated church or reception hall.  Except that won\u2019t happen because most of the people invited won\u2019t go along with it, and your Aunt doesn\u2019t want to spend the money or put the time in.  Which is why you should say no.  They are hijacking your day, and while it is truly awful what your cousin is going through this is just not an appropriate ask.", "NTA from any angle\n\nThis request is beyond inappropriate and very much the start of an \"if you give a mouse a cookie\" scenario. If you give your aunt this walk, she'll want her daughter to wear a white dress. If you say yes to the dress, she'll want to add music. If you say yes to the music... This also creates an entire culture around the event of how many ways you can be the bad guy and essentially turns your wedding into a memorial service with the late guest of honor very much on time and in attendance!\n\nThe aunt must be out of her mind with grief and grasping for ways to immortalize her child. But that doesn't mean it has to be your job to fix it or you have anything overshadowing your event. The absolute most you could offer, depending on where the wedding is and *if you want to*, is a professional photo of the parents and the cousin standing at the start of the aisle before they are shown their seats. That's the moment of what is now and what is wished that could have been. That is going to be what the experience would have eventually become in their memory anyway. Telling the photography team (and DJ, etc) that there is danger of someone trying to overtake attention at the event will be a good idea. The photographer can frame it (no pun intended) so it comes across as \"the bride wants a special photo of her cousin with her parents\" ensures the focus stays on you and there is no spiraling out of control (constantly accompanied by usher, photographer, usher again, people talking to them once seated). But only *if you want to*.\n\nIt's possible none of this may matter at the time of the wedding. But handling it in a way you can feel comfortable with is also necessary.

Her using your dress? Her using your photographer? Or does she expect to cut your wedding cake?\n\nI know your cousin is sick, however what she is asking is completely inappropriate and selfish. She is trying to make your day about her and her illness.\n\n\n\nI would also post a link of this post on your social media so your aunt and cousin can see how selfish and entitled this is. \n\nIf I was at a wedding and someone did this  I would judge them.

We had set up the cake so that the pictures would have a nice backdrop. If I was being forced into a party, I was gonna have a cake (it wasn't fancy, I just wanted to pick the flavors and make it two tiered lol), and I was going to have a picture with my cake and the stupid plastic diploma on it. Turns out, my cousin was trying to gather documentation for her marriage for her partner's visa. Next thing I know, I see my cousin in some very elaborate clothing that strongly indicated she was a bride, with her husband dressed similarly, posing for pictures around the venue, asking family members to join them, etc. I had no idea this was going to happen, and no one but my cousin's immediate family was in on it. What really got to me was when my cousin, who was the bride's brother, asked me if they could move the cake because that was the best backdrop for a picture. Before I could answer, my sister, bless her, gives him a look, so my cousin backtracks and says sorry. Then he asks if once I'm done cutting the top tier, can I leave the second tier for his sister/BIL to cut together because there wasn't obvious graduation decor on that part. What?! I was quite a pushover and started figuring out how to work this when my sister walks over to him and says something. I'm not sure what was said but he walked away. Later on they did sneak over to try to get a picture with the cut cake and of them feeding each other, which my sister suspected would happen, and made sure the shot couldn't happen. I'm glad my sister stepped in, and I've since learned to challenge BS as it happens. \n\nMy therapist is gonna be thrilled that my brain is starting to unlock memories from that time period.
