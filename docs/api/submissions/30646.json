I go to a very expensive audition-only school that is not like traditional universities, so unlike them, we get placed in a group of people who have the same major as us, and we have all of our classes with them. One of my classmates (M18) who I'll call Finn (fake name), has been subtly hitting on me since I met him during orientation week. I made it clear right off the bat that I'm Lesbian to make sure there was no confusion there, and I remained friendly with him after we met. Despite him knowing I was gay, I still very much got the feeling he was hitting on me, but I brushed it off. Then, a couple of weeks ago, the roommate of someone from my group got sent unsolicited D pics by, you guessed it, Finn. She reported him to the school, and he was reprimanded but continued being in our class. Afterward, other girls said he'd done the same thing to them, but they didn't report him.  \n\n\nAlthough I'm glad I did something about what was going on instead of keeping my mouth shut like I usually would, I'm starting to question if I should've just talked to someone about smaller consequences instead of filing a report.(i.e., DMing me randomly, offering to walk me to and from our dorm building, staring at me in class, etc.) I was uncomfortable, but I had friends who knew and were making sure he wasn't crossing any lines. Then, yesterday, it hit the fan. I met and was talking to the girl who originally got sent the nudes, and she mentioned to me that she saw me walking back to my dorm the other day, and Finn was following behind me in a speed walk. This scared me, so I mentioned it to a couple of my friends, and they both said they had seen him following me around campus on multiple occasions, but they thought I knew. I didn't, and I felt sick to my stomach. They told me to report him, and I was aware that another report could get him kicked out, and I did.   \n\n\nToday, one of the guys who's still friends with him (M23) somehow found out about the report from some other people in our class, and he approached me practically seething. He started ranting about how Finn worked so hard to get out of the small town he's from and away from his unsupportive family to get to this school and how he couldn't believe I was \"Ruining someone's future over something that's not that deep.\" He then said that Finn is only 18 and he's made some stupid mistakes, but he's talented, and he deserves to make it, etc. Obviously, many people are on my side, but some people (including a couple teachers) think I could've dealt with the situation in a less extreme way, and that Finn doesn't deserve to be completely kicked to the curb.  \n\n\nAlthough I'm glad I did something about what was going on instead of keeping my mouth shut like I usually would (anxiety), I'm starting to question if I should've just talked to someone about smaller consequences for him instead of filing a report.  \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699526328, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ra6qj/aita_for_ruining_someones_future_over_something/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You clearly stated where you stand and that you aren't interested in finn so he should have left it there and be respectful of that, not only that he sent unsolicited pictures to other girls which is frankly disgusting and concerning and thankfully he did get reported, it should have stopped there, even before but he didn't. He didn't just follow you, he stalked you, and that is scary and your not the asshole for reporting him. What he did was the consequences of his actions, he ruined his own future by making the decision to stalk someone and to send unsolicited pictures when he should have been doing literally anything else like knitting.", "Send them the stats on campus rape and sexual assault.

Bloody hell, they need to learn that if you mess up, and you have a warning and still do stupid things, there are consequences.", "NTA.\n\nPeople need to stop the \"But what about HIS life?\" garbage.  What about YOUR life and the lives of the other women he harassed?  He isn't more important than the lot of you.  Some guys count on that attitude so they are never held to account for their actions.  They just keep up what they're doing (or do progressively worse things) until they're held accountable.", "NTA and don\u2019t ever think you\u2019re doing too much in a situation like this. You worked hard to get there too just like everyone else so why is HE so special? And he should\u2019ve thought about how he \u201ccame from a small town\u201d (blah blah blah) before he did what he did to you and others. Actions have consequences. What would\u2019ve happened if he didn\u2019t get reported and on one of the many days he was following you, you paused for too long and he caught up? He wasn\u2019t following you for no reason.

That friend should not be enabling this shitty behaviour. Finn brought it on himself.", "NTA.\n\n99% of the time when someone says it's not that deep it absolutely is that deep but the person saying it isn't.", "NTA. Let me get this straight, after receiving a reprimand for harassing a fellow student he didn't modify his behavior except to change the methods of harassment... and you're all supposed to simply to take it?", "NTA. Your college has policies to fit the situation and the college acted accordingly. Finn is a menace and he earned his expulsion.  Having \u2018talent\u2019 doesn\u2019t excuse creepy or criminal behavior.", "Honestly, I'd report the friends who are making these accusations too. They knew he was \"making mistakes\" and didn't intervene? Either they don't know what \"deep\" means in regards to behaviors in college, or they're retaliating on his behalf, which means they're potential predators too. NTA", "NTA. Finn can't or won't control himself and he is making yours and other girl's time at the school difficult with his sexual harassment. He doesn't deserve to make it at the expense of the safety of other. He deserves the consequences of his actions. Tell the guy that confronted you that time is up for protecting people that sexually assault, stalk or harass others and that if Finn wanted to have his education at that school, he wouldn't be making it impossible for others to do the same. Then tell him to leave you alone.", "If nothing else, Finn is a diligent little creep.  Multiple unsolicited dick pics, being routinely spotted following someone around campus... you can't say he's not keeping busy.\n\nYou're NTA.  If this wasn't an absolute well-described pattern of behavior for him he'd have gotten a slap on the wrist as he did with the previous young woman he harrassed.  It wasn't.  It's his thing.  And these are the consequences of his thing.", "NTA. \n\nIf Finn is so talented, he will have other opportunities, and a chance not to ruin them by harassing women.", "NTA, Finn wouldn't have been expelled if he hadn't acted like a stalker, he brought this to himself and whoever gives you grief about it, tell them that they're blaming the victim which is even more Fd up.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. Sexual harassment, harassment, and alleged stalking have consequences.\n\nWould Finn's \"seething friend\" be okay if a niece, a sister, a cousin, etc, received this kind of treatment? I use family relations because evidently Finn's friend does not value the safety of his specifically female acquaintances, classmates, and friends.\n\nWould he be okay with it happening him? Would he say, \"Oh, this guy who is stalking me around the campus and keeps flashing me his dick and messages me constantly despite me repeatedly asking him to stop is completely justified in doing so because he came from a small town?\"\n\nRight now Finn's friend is making the same excuses that allows rapists like Allen Turner, formerly known as Brock Turner, to operate with or with relative impunity.", "Nta his talent does not excuse his behaviour. Sure he's young, but old enough to know that his behaviour was inappropriate. There are consequences to out actions and it's time he learned that lesson, as hard as it may be for him. Thst is his cross to bear. \n\nDon't carry that guilt around. You had every right to report his absurd behaviour.", "NTA have to say though if he\u2019s doing it now he won\u2019t make it in any of the creative arts. As much as talent is important there is a lot of emphasis on cooperation and safety. Word of mouth is so key and they will avoid him like the plague.

He ruined his own future by sending unsolicited nudes, making you and others uncomfortable, and for stalking you around campus.

What Finn did weren't mistakes, they were choices, and those choices resulted in an unfortunate, but expected and appropriate outcome.

However, they could bring up security footage and see if, indeed, he was following you regularly.\n\nMaybe this is only his second strike and it will wake him up enough that he will change.

Holy crap I can't imagine telling another person let alone a woman that was being stalked that was also sending unsolicited dick pics to multiple girls it's her fault for his choices. Get a grip.

The entire point of the hang outs was for him to hit on and try to pick up his *teenaged* or very young adult female *students*. He'd ignore any male or old (me) students and just slime all over the young women. As an age peer I did speak to him about the inappropriate behaviour but he brushed me off as seeing things that weren't there. And ofc made noises about how I had to respect him as my prof.  \n\nSo I talked to the girls and they were so uncomfortable. Fuck him. Took it to his/our department head in a casual conversation but backed by my willingness (and some of the male classmates too) to make a formal complaint. \n\n\"Cool, young prof\" times ended immediately and holy fuck did he hate me. Got my work marked by the dept head to make sure I didn't get retaliated against. The TA rumour mill got back to me about what I was being called, dude seriously couldn't handle that a *woman* shut his shit down and protected other women from his predatory shit. Oh noes.", "This. If you don't want to get kicked out of school don't do things that will get you kicked out of school. It takes zero effort to keep your dick pics to yourself and not stalk people.
