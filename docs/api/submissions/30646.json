YOU didn't handle the situation in an \"extreme\" way. you reported, and let's call it what it is here, S-T-A-L-K-I-N-G. the school decided on the punishment, not you. if they don't like it then those so called \"teachers\" can rally on his behalf and ask the school to take him back.  \n\nOP you put your personal safety first and that is not something to ever feel bad about.\n\nstay safe", "NTA this is exactly the culture that needs to die in the arts which is what I'm assuming your school is. I mean it needs to die in all fields but clamping down on shitty behaviour starts with this. If he's bright enough to get into that school he's bright enough to realise following a girl close behind her is creepy. And you already know it's not an isolated incident and you weren't the only one effective. You're good.", "NTA.\n\nFinn\u2019s tragic backstory is not relevant, nor is it your problem. If he wanted to stay at that school, it would\u2019ve been so easy to simply *not* harass his female classmates. So easy! But harassing you was clearly more important to him than his education was. He made his choice, and he made it well before you reported him. If it hadn\u2019t been you, it would\u2019ve been someone else. \n\nKeep a wary eye on this friend of his. I\u2019d assume he\u2019s this upset because he shares Finn\u2019s attitudes towards women, and is super pissed at the idea that he might not be able to wriggle out of unpleasant consequences.", "NTA, Finn ruined his own future by being a f**king creep. I doubt he\u2019ll even learn anything from this, just blame all his victims.\n\nYou all deserve to feel safe, he deserves an even worse punishment imo. What starts as unsolicited advances & stalking turns into r*pe and violence.", ">Fin is only 18 and he\u2019s made some stupid mistakes.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I too have made plenty of stupid mistakes. However those never involved sending unsolicited dick pics or stalking women. Some mistakes are innocent, Finn\u2019s are certainly not. I hope he learns from them and redeems himself, but chances of that are low with these friends pushing the blame onto his victims. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nActions have consequences.\nYou reap what you sow.\nPoor choices lead to unpleasant outcomes.\nFAFO.\n\nThe guy is a safety threat to women.\nHe probably shouldn't be allowed to have any more power and the prestige this course would give him, lest he become a truly dangerous predator.", "NTA\n\nFinn didn't deserve to make it if it also came with him being a creep.", "Yeah.... If someone had dealt with the dude that triggered the #metoo movement decades ago, a lot of people would have been spared some pain.  F*ck that guy.  Talent doesn't give someone an excuse to act like a predator.  NTA.", "Stalking. Sending unsolicited dick pics. Tell his friend that Finn is lucky he's only getting kicked out. You could have filed for a restraining order. Which would have had the same effect since he wouldn't be able to attend classes. NTA.\n\nAlso, ask his friend why he felt entitled to harrass, stalk, be generally creepy, and send those unsolicited pictures to multiple women. If he was so bloody eager to get out of his small town, he should have kept his head down and concentrated on his classes, not pursuing women who wanted nothing to do with him.", "NTA. He ruined his own future. He wouldn\u2019t have gotten kicked out if it really \u201cwasn\u2019t that deep.\u201d", "NTA.  If he's not already a sexual predator he's well on his way to being one.  Maybe this will be the wakeup call he needs.\n\nEither way you're not responsible for his actions.  That's what asshole #2 (#1 being Finn) was trying to do.  Make you responsible for Finn's actions so Finn didn't suffer any consequences.  FYI you should report him if you haven't.  Your school has a duty to ensure you don't suffer repercussions for reporting sexual harassment.  BTW you worked just as hard and deserve to study without any harassment.", "NTA.\n\nBill Cosby is talented. Convicted of sexual assault.\nHarvey Weinstein is talented.

Now he's stalking you. This is an escalation and you know where it ends up. Which is why you reported it. If this guy cared SO much about getting out of his small town. He wouldn't be putting in jeopardy with his actions. Also, all of the women he is sexually harassing with his behavior deserve to go to school in a safe environment.", "NTA. Let\u2019s be clear here, you didn\u2019t get Finn kicked out, Finn got himself kicked out for being a creep. Tell his friend that it must be nice to go through life not being worried about being sexually harassed and stalked and that he doesn\u2019t get to decide for you & the other girls how to feel about it. \n\nIf Finn wanted to stay all he had to do was stop harassing and stalking female students. You didn\u2019t make the call, you reported his behavior and the school made the call because they have a duty to the whole student body, not just Finn.", "NTA. If this guy was following you around after it was made clear to him you weren\u2019t interested, you have every right to be apprehensive and even alarmed. No matter how talented he is or how hard he worked to secure a spot at that school, his inability to stop being downright creepy makes me think you did the right thing.", "And if Finn is so talented, imagine if he got famous and started taking advantage of people. He would find it MUCH easier\n\nOP has stopped a future predator in their tracks", "You'd be amazed at how often other women treat women who report stuff like this like shit.  There is a big attitude among some women that this is just something that we should put up with and get used to, since they have to.\n\nedit: I've seen this mostly with older women.  It's usually a case of sexual harassment being so much more open and terrible back when they were younger that in comparison they just don't see why modern women make a fuss.  It's really more sad than anything.  It just shows how incredibly low the bar used to be.", "To add to this: Finn\u2019s level of talent is utterly irrelevant. Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Bill Cosby, and Roman Polanski are all, arguably, talented. They\u2019re also predators. The arts and entertainment industries are full of creeps with talent. It\u2019s a shame people like OP\u2019s peers still value a man\u2019s \u201cskills\u201d over a woman\u2019s safety.", "And then when he actually does something completely unhinged, they would be like BuT WhY DiDnT yOu SaY bEfOrE so you can't win anyway", "I would almost bet that the others didn't report him because they were afraid that he would either 1) retaliate for getting him in trouble or 2) someone else would approach them and harass them. \n\nThe fact that this dude's friend KNEW, who reported his friend (out of all of the multiple girls this dude has done this too) and approached her, is alarming. It proves this situation wasn't handled with care or autonomous. \n\nShe's is there to learn. Not be stalked and get sent unsolicited pictures and then harassed when she reported him for her own safety. Letting his actions slide would only enable him to do something worse in the future.\n\nNTA, OP.", "Personally the part I find unbelievable is that a man actually faced consequences for harassment. I hope it's true but that's not part of my experience.", "I'm guessing that there *were* more than just those two reports, it's just that OP either didn't talk to the people who made the reports, or some of those people told her they hadn't made reports for whatever reason of their own, or they made their reports after talking to her and others about his behavior.", "Then why even keep reading this sub?  Seems like a stupid choice to keep reading but assuming most posts are fake.", "It's also possible that professors or other staff made reports about things they were told or saw.\n\nI'm in the US- and I don't know if OP is- but as university staff, we're required to report all sorts of things that fall into sexual harassment categories.\n\nI just passed my sexual harassment test- you'd think I'd remember if you had to report student-student sexual harassment but I don't interact with students so I may have immediately forgotten that part. At my school I think you'd be advised to as a precaution.\n\nThey have a history of poor choices in that area..", "Oh what a lovely comment, thank you! You just made my day, seriously.\n\nI believe very, very strongly that if you have privilege it's imperative to use it for the benefit of others. In this case, none of the 'kids' wanted to rock the boat. The process of making a complaint was just too overwhelming and scary. Plus the fear of retaliation from the prof. \n\nI was privileged by being an adult at least a decade older, which meant the level of fucks I gave for keeping the peace was considerably lower. I became seriously ill with a mystery illness (Fibromyalgia) and had been dealing with all my profs and the department a TON for accommodations for a couple years so I was *well known* and automatically taken seriously. Plus pervert prof was a new hire. I knew walking in to making the complaint that I was the one holding all the cards.\n\nAnd honestly, fuck him. He got the quiet one to one warning and pulled he \"I'm your prof\" card instead of behaving himself. FAFO.\n\nThank you again, internet stranger for being lovely!", "NTA. He is being sexually inappropriate with women. It needs to stop. Reporting sexually inappropriate people always is the right thing to do. Tell him that you know that he's following you and to stop it immediately. Document it. If it persists, report him. You should consider carrying mace.", "NTA\n\nFrankly I hope karma gets him", "A guy in my film club at my community college was constantly telling off-color jokes to women. He would call any woman who wasn\u2019t immediately interested in him a sobriquet that I won\u2019t share. A. He was married at the time and B. He was a lumpy pear-shaped troll. He made my skin crawl but the professor running the club thought he was funny so he got to stay. (I was in high school\u2014as an adult I would have walked much earlier.) After I moved on Professor and funny man bought a movie theater in a nearby small town together. About a year later funny man was arrested for first degree rape. I don\u2019t know the particulars but it was apparently not the first time. He got convicted and professor had to declare bankruptcy and lost his house\u2014I don\u2019t believe professor knew about funny man\u2019s rapes prior to the arrest but there sure were a lot of red flags he ignored. NTA at all.", "I didn\u2019t realize \u201cbeing smart\u201d excused stalking and sexual harassment", "\"Including a couple of teachers\" ...who would have done what? Waited until for confirmation he had a hatchet because he'd buried it in your skull?\n\nNTA. Good on you for getting through this. Definitely cozy up to someone in admin and casually mention those teachers' names.", "NTA you did the right thing, the guy was stalking you he could do worse thank god you reported it", "NTA. You deserve to be safe at the school you attend, as do every other student. Finn did not make mistakes, he displayed a pattern of behaviour he was repeatedly called out on and continued regardless. Finn getting kicked out is entirely on Finn. And no matter how 'talented' Finn is, I am sure there are equally talented people who deserve to attend that school just as much who also know how to behave in society and won't sexually harass their fellow classmates.", "If someone faces consequences because you were honest about their actions then you didn\u2019t ruin their life. They did. NTA", "You and all of these women who have been harassed are talented and deserve to exist in college without having to fear harassment. His \"talent\" comes with a shitty personality, and it doesn't seem to add anything to your university. He isn't worth anything you women can give to the world a thousandfold. \n\nTake it from someone who's had to live with her r\\*\\*ist walk free to hurt more people, this is giving Finn a necessary sense of consequences for his actions. Even if Title IX/university police decide not to hold him responsible (which is unfortunately common in stalking cases), it'll be on his record and he'll at least be more nervous about committing future misconduct, since he'll be on his last strike.", "NTA - his actions are what got him in trouble, not you. If he didn\u2019t want to get kicked out he shouldn\u2019t have acted like that. When people keep letting men off for their behaviour they just keep doing it. No amount of talent should exempt someone from the consequences.", "NTA\n\nSociety will always make excuses for shitty men. Somehow someway he didn't know better or it was just a mistake. And trust it will be the same men insisting society hates men so much men are afraid to smile at a woman for fear of prison. So somehow stalking a woman is just a well meaning mistake but society has men so scared to smile at women ..\n\n\nHe sent multiple women unwanted dick pics. Those were choices.\n\nJust because a man doesn't like the consequences of his behavior doesn't suddenly make his choices a mistake.", "Definately NTA here. Stalking is not good at any level.

Was that a good reason to not report him?\n\nDude's a sexual predator, making excuses or justifications about \"oh his unsupportive family\" is how other people get abused.
