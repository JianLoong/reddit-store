We delayed any planning to avoid me from getting distracted since I\u2019m about to take the bar exam and I tend to hyperfixate.\n\nI\u2019m Roman Catholic and have always dreamt of being married in a catholic church. My fianc\u00e9 knows about this and knows I\u2019ve never really had any celebration (bdays, achievements, other life events never celebrated) in my life so I\u2019m just waiting for me to get married.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9\u2019s father has a high position in their church which is equal to that of a priest. So I\u2019ve thrown away my dreams of a church wedding and said I\u2019m okay with a destination wedding. He agreed that he also doesn\u2019t want to be married in their church anyway since the location is extremely inconvenient for everyone and wouldn\u2019t look good in photos.\n\nWe haven\u2019t talked about the wedding until one day he said that FFIL said that if we\u2019re getting married with a Catholic priest, it would be better if we just do a civil wedding. I got hurt and mad and told my fianc\u00e9 FFIL shouldn\u2019t be deciding for us since he isn\u2019t the one getting married and he wouldn\u2019t even be giving a single penny for the wedding so why should his opinion matter.\n\nMy FFIL and I never really had a good relationship. He refuses to accept my friend requests, always ignores me during gatherings, was pretty excited when my fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex who goes to their church contacted him and asked for fianc\u00e9\u2019s number, and during the few private masses I attended, he\u2019d always talk badly about rich people while looking at me. Our families have a significant financial difference and my fianc\u00e9 said that it might just be because FIL\u2019s insecure (the house we\u2019re living, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s car, gold jewelry are all from my parents). FFIL is not the provider type.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 got mad and accused me of disrespecting his father. I told him FFIL disrespected me first and they should have not planned about the wedding without asking for my opinion. He then accused me of just wanting to always get my way and that I am just trying to be controlling. He reasoned out that it would be embarrassing if other people find out that the son of a \u201cpriest\u201d got married under roman catholic. I told him all I wanted was for him to acknowledge the pain I felt when my beliefs were disregarded and my dreams crushed when I was told I\u2019d only get married in a Civil wedding. He told me why would I even care what priest officiates our wedding since it\u2019s not in a church. He later on admitted that he assumed that because he\u2019s a son of a \u201cpriest,\u201d I would just convert to their religion, then accused me of not accepting that part of him. I simply told him that he should have looked for a girl who\u2019s already of their own.\n\nBoth of us wont budge so I said if he wants a civil wedding then we\u2019d just do the bare minimum of 2 witnesses and neither families invited. I feel like I may have overreacted a bit, so AITA?\n\nEdit: we\u2019re part of Eastern Catholic Church, not covered by prohibition of outdoor weddings.

Send him back to his parents.", "YTA. you\u2019re conveniently leaving out the fact that in order to get married in a catholic church, both spouses must be catholic. in order to get your way, your fianc\u00e9 would have to convert to a religion he doesn\u2019t agree with, and that\u2019s a pretty shitty thing to ask of someone you love. you\u2019re not compatible, this isn\u2019t gonna work.", "NTA and run while you can.", "Totally agree. He's loving the life her family's money gives him.\n\nIt is sooooo much easier to break up than to divorce", "Could you not speak to your fiance & see if there's room for compromise here? People seem to be all up in their feelings but no one is actually upholding the tenants of the ceremony they all seem to be fighting about. Could you be married by the Catholic Priest & have FIL give a special blessing at the ceremony? If this was actually about both of your relationship with each other & with your chosen deity that would be one thing but this just seems about societal appearances, at least from how you describe FFIL's attitude. If you & your fiance cannot come to terms with a decision on your own, as a couple, you should go for couples counseling immediately (and not the kind held by either one of your churches). This isn't about religion.", "This is another red flag. Don\u2019t have kids just bc your fianc\u00e9 wants them.", "So he\u2019s bad at communicating and ignores what you want. He hates that you are vocal abt what you want. Red flags. People are usually on their best behavior when they\u2019re dating. You are now seeing his true nature.", "Some people are slack abt religion in their youth and get strictly religious when they settle down and marry.", "\"Greek\" ie Orthodox Catholic, maybe?  Originally Orthodox under Habsburg rule they pledged alliance to the Pope, but still follow Orthodox rules.", "Are you from Greece?", "He's an abuser showing his true colors. They pretend to be nice then once they think you're trapped (like through marriage or pregnancy) the abuse starts.", "NTA\n\nHe was not honest in your conversations about marriage, it was manipulative of him to say what you wanted to hear while believing he would get his way later.\n\nPlease think about how having this man as the father of your children will impact their life. He and FFIL will insist they are raised in his faith and he has already shown that any conversations you've had about the future cannot be trusted.", "NTA and frankly this sounds like an impasse that\u2019s not going to be overcome, largely because of your partner\u2019s father\u2019s influence. It sucks you\u2019ve spent five years, but this is just the tip of the ice berg and it\u2019s clear your partner\u2019s family is trying to erase a part of your identity that you value. Rip the bandaid off and end it ASAP", "He won\u2019t compromise. He expects you to compromise your beliefs all while your expected to respect his beliefs. Then he blames you? He threatens you in order to get what he wants. His dad should not be telling you what you are going to do for your wedding. If he wants to have a wedding tell him to have his own.", "The only way everyone gets what they want is if you have a judge come along to the destination wedding. Maybe you can have one of your mutual friends ordained in a third party church. At this point neither of your priests is going to win without some collateral damage.", "NTA\n\nBut this is not a good situation.  His assumption that you would convert is a big red flag.  I'm guessing FFIL is biased against you because you are not kowtowing to your male \"betters.\"  The assumption you would convert indicates that your fiance may be of the same mindset.", "My issue that worries me that there is no possibility of divorce.  5 years together and is it getting closer to the wedding, he is changing his tone to argue with you to force you to convert or insist your children will be of his religion when already agreeing to not force either religion on them.  Your lifetime will be properly be hell.  He will sweet talk your parents to help you to reestablish the relationship.  I now many cultures have expected close family ties.  Please have your parents read this post and comments.  I have a question.  You lost your friends because of him, if that\u2019s true then it is absolutely a tactic to isolate you.  It\u2019s going to get worse.  If you can\u2019t get help from your parents then look up your old friends. They probably do understand and maybe one will give you temporarily a place to live with them until you can you can get on your feet and start a new chapter in your life without him and his controlling behavior.", "Sorry but what is FFIL?", "You need to sit down and have a serious  conversion about your respective beliefs and how you plan to live your lives before you get married.  \n\nHave you even discussed what would happen if you had kids.  I\u2019m betting the son of the priest will expect them to join his church and I get the feeling that this would be a big no from you.", "He just assumed you'd convert? That's where the discussion needs to start. And frankly, it sounds like that's where the discussion, and the engagement, might need to end.", "Armenian Apostolic?", "I thought every eastern European country had it's own Orthodox Church.", "This relationship was doomed from the start. Have you even discussed children and what religion they would grow up with? You should just cut your loses.", "OP says they did talk about religion and that he was never really into his own religion, but then he admitted he had always assumed she would just convert after marriage. This is unfortunately a very common tactic. Heck my own ex fully admitted to me after 4 years that he just agreed with whatever I said on topics (ie religion, having kids etc) because he assumed he could just make me change my mind later.", "RUN, NOT WALK BUT  RUN from your  hopefully ex fiance.  \n\nNta  but he is the controlling one and a huge ah\nHe wanted you to convert  to his religion \nHe ignored your whishes \nHe puts his father whishes above your comfort \nYou don't get along  and are treated badly  by his family.  Why on earth  do you want to marry him and end up  in an even worse situation?!\nEverything  is yours  house  , car etc paid by your parents  ffs leave him and find someone who loves and respects you and treats you like a partner."]}
