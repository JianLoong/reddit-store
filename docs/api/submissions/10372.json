I got hurt and mad and told my fianc\u00e9 FFIL shouldn\u2019t be deciding for us since he isn\u2019t the one getting married and he wouldn\u2019t even be giving a single penny for the wedding so why should his opinion matter.\n\nMy FFIL and I never really had a good relationship. He refuses to accept my friend requests, always ignores me during gatherings, was pretty excited when my fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex who goes to their church contacted him and asked for fianc\u00e9\u2019s number, and during the few private masses I attended, he\u2019d always talk badly about rich people while looking at me.

He later on admitted that he assumed that because he\u2019s a son of a \u201cpriest,\u201d I would just convert to their religion, then accused me of not accepting that part of him.

If only he\u2019d asked earlier and never made me feel I\u2019m forced to do so just because he is a son of a priest then maybe I would have reconsidered.", "We\u2019ve always discussed about religion. Their religion only exists in our country and is extremely similar to Catholic. He never goes to church on Sundays and expressed that he also has doubts on organized religion and admits he isn\u2019t as devoted as his family is. FSIL and FMIL even encourages him to go to church with me since their church is too far away from where fianc\u00e9 and I live. So I never really thought it was a big deal to him until his father said that statement. We both agreed to raise our children not forcing religion on them, but after the conversation he seems to have changed his mind. It also shocked me. I only refuse to get married under their religion because I was waiting for him to acknowledge I got hurt and his father seems to enjoy gaining control over people under their religion. Fianc\u00e9 admits FIL seems to do a powerplay over members of their church making them do personal errands for him so I\u2019m scared he\u2019d do the same to our children.", "He used to bring me to their church which is also Catholic but only existing in our country for about a total of 4 times until I refused since they were starting to force me to get involved in the ceremony and I have social anxiety. He used to claim he has doubts over organized religion, admits he is not as devoted as his family, refused to go to church on Sundays and agreed we\u2019d raise our children not forcing religion on them. So this is all new to me, his only argument is he is a son of a priest. He know refuses to answer if he\u2019s also gonna force me to get our children baptized under their religion even after we both agreed no forcing of religion. I didn\u2019t really expect our officiant to be Roman Catholic but I was hoping we would just discuss which among priests of the two religions we\u2019d get basing on how the priest handles ceremonies.", "He never really directly told me he wanted me to convert until now. He just used to bring me to their church which I don\u2019t mind since it\u2019s still Catholic with minor differences. We stopped when I refused to go anymore since I have a few issues with some of their members and I feel being forced on being part of the ceremony (reading, etc.) I never really thought it was an issue since he even expressed doubts on organized religion and he refuses to go to church on Sundays and admitted he is not as devoted as his family. I have no idea where all this is coming from and his only reason is he is a son of a priest and should be married under their religion.", "Their religion is also Catholic but only exists in our country so the practice is extremely similar save for the part that their \u201cpriest\u201d is allowed to get married. FMIL and FSIL even encourages my fianc\u00e9 to go to church with me since their church is too far from where we live and the whole mass is the same anyway. Fianc\u00e9 is not as devoted as his family and doesn\u2019t even go to church on Sundays so all of this is a shocker to me. His only argument is he\u2019s a son a priest and therefore should be married under their specific religion.", "Catholic wedding destinations are pretty common in our country. I was not really expecting that the priest would be ultimately Roman Catholic. I just hoped we were gonna discuss it between the two us which officiant to choose among two religions based on how the priest handles ceremonies and not based on religion. In our country, only priests and judges are allowed to officiate weddings, and civil weddings will ultimately be done inside a court and be done in a few minutes. Our courts are extremely small and would barely fit 20 people.\n\nI can\u2019t mention their specific religion cause I don\u2019t want my country identified and some people might recognize me.", "It sounds like OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is a member of one of the Eastern Catholic Churches, which used to be Orthodox.", "My fianc\u00e9 is still Catholic but a denomination which only exists in our country. I don\u2019t actually expect our wedding to be Roman Catholic that\u2019s why I compromised on a destination wedding. I was just expecting we\u2019d choose a priest who would be best for the ceremony between to Catholic religions instead of just telling me that he\u2019s a son of a priest so he should be married under their religion. Prior to this he refuses to go to church, admits he\u2019s not as devoted as his family, and even expressed doubts over organized religion. He never really directly asked me if I would convert, he just expected I would. We both even agreed we would raise our children not forcing religion on them but now he refuses to answer if he was also expecting our children be baptized under their religion", "How similar to Roman Catholic can it be if the \u201cpriest\u201d is married with children?", ">\"o it was a shock to me too when fianc\u00e9 said he wouldn\u2019t get married to me if I choose a Catholic priest.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is only a problem if YOU will not get married to him if he choses a priest of HIs religion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are EXACTLY EQUAL in this. And BOTH OF YOU failed to discuss it.", "Their religion is still Catholic but only exists in our country. I was not really expecting it to be fixed on having a Roman Catholic priest. I was just hoping we\u2019d discuss about who would officiate our wedding and choose among priests of both religion would be best for our wedding. That\u2019s why it was a shocker for me that he suddenly said he wouldn\u2019t budge on the priest. Prior all this he isn\u2019t even devoted and refuses to go to church on Sundays and even expressed doubts on organized religion. When we talked about raising our children not forcing religion on them, I honestly thought he wouldn\u2019t make which priest a big deal.", "You need to think about FILs powetplay. This is what your life will be like if you marry this man, his father will make all the decisions. Is that what you want?", "So he just assumed you\u2019d convert and raise your kids in his religion, but he\u2019s also not devout? It sounds like he was deliberately telling you what you wanted to hear and sending mixed messages, and now is now upset that you\u2019re not playing along with his secret game plan. I\u2019d maybe postpone the wedding and get couples counseling to see if it can be resolved somehow , but honestly, it sounds like you\u2019re just not compatible long-term. I\u2019d be wondering what else he was potentially lying about in hope that you\u2019d just go along.", "You need to realize and accept he\u2019s been lying.", "If they're not in communion with Rome, they're not Catholic. It doesn't sound like they belong to one of the 22 churches in communion with Rome so they're nor Catholic.\n\nIf they're Old Catholics they're not Catholic. If they're part of the Polish National Catholic church they're not Catholic.", "That he refuses to go to church with you tells me he doesn\u2019t respect you or your beliefs. Is that something you can live with? Because I couldn\u2019t.", " What about your future children, if you have any? are you in the same page about how you will raise them?", "If his church isn't in communion with Rome he isn't Catholic.", "That\u2019s really worrying that FFIL abuses his position that way, and definitely un-Christian. That\u2019s a huge red flag \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "INFO: what church is it?", "This is really hard - our sympathies go out to you.  YNTA", "Good luck. It sounds extremely complicated.", "We all used to be Orthodox...\n\nOr, more accurately, schismed in the 11th century.", "Greek Orthodox bro", "Everything else is exactly the same with Roman Catholics \u2014 how the church looks, ceremony, doing the sign of the cross, beliefs, sacristans, down to almost every detail. This has a long history of how they started but basically those who started this religion used to be priests of Roman Catholic and decided to build a new religion not controlled by (then) Spaniards. Their reasoning is Priests are not commander by God\u2019s Law to abstain from marriage so they may do so in their own discretion. My fianc\u00e9 used to say it was so they could recruit more people who wanted to be priests but still have a family.", "In the US most catholic priests will not marry outside of the church.  The Code of Canon Law says, \u201cMarriages are to be celebrated in a parish where either of the contracting parties has a domicile\u2026 With the permission of the proper ordinary or proper pastor, marriages can be celebrated elsewhere.\u201d  So that's odd to me.  My niece got married at a barn place and then had to do a short church ceremony with just the parents since they wanted to be there.  Are you sure that's even a possibility?\n\nWhy isn't the choice of a non-denominational person because choosing among priests of both religions is still going to be an issue.", "I feel like choosing a priest of either denomination is just going to breed resentment about who got their way regarding your wedding, when a civil ceremony is a completely neutral option. If not having a priest at your wedding is a deal breaker there are going to be a lot of deal breakers throughout your marriage since religion isn't just prevalent during your ceremony.", "Honestly they only label themselves Catholic since the religion was started by previously Roman Catholic priests who decided to form a different religion. So their whole ceremony and everything else is the same with Catholics.", "Wasn\u2019t the whole fight in the Catholic Church that this doctrine you are talking about is not actually in the bible and was just an arbitrary rule that was put on by the church? Frankly I don\u2019t understand how you can follow a religion that pretty much just picks and chooses what they want.\nBut either way, Nta obviously. This guy lied to you and you were very clear from the start.", "It really depends on the area and the individual priest but it\u2019s not impossible. There are actually sites and programs geared towards matching people with Catholic priests comfortable with conducting weddings off sacred ground and/or with clergy from other faiths. These weddings are still recorded as receiving the Sacrement of Marriage.", "It may be because in our country only priests, pastors, (church leaders) and judges are only allowed to officiate weddings. Judges can only officiate inside their court, and since our country is dominantly Catholic, they\u2019ve allowed destination weddings officiated by priests.", "So it's still basically a Catholic ceremony if recorded that way.  You really need to rethink if you won't consider a non-denominational officiant or he really wants you to follow his religion.", "It depends on the other faith whether it\u2019s recognized in that religion but the Catholic side is covered."]}
