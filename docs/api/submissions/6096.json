I really appreciated them. Idk how to express this lol but I\u2019m grateful.\n\nThe update:\n\nAfter reading all the comments on my post, I decided to talk to my sisters on both sides about what my parents told me. Well, the one on my dad\u2019s side said that she doesn\u2019t see me as important enough to watch her perform. The ones on my mom\u2019s side straight up admitted that they don\u2019t care for my brother or I and never asked for me to go to their games. \n\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t care. We don\u2019t actively hate each other or anything and are civil at best. My step sister (dad\u2019s side) prefers being on her own and my half sisters (mom\u2019s side) know very well that I\u2019m much closer to my brother than them. Maybe if our parents weren\u2019t terrible, things could\u2019ve been different but it is what it is. \n\nFrom now on, I will no longer be going to my sisters things unless they ask me. I have a very demanding job and I just found out I\u2019m pregnant so I won\u2019t have time at all. \n\nSpeaking of me being pregnant, my brother was the first person my boyfriend and I told and he was clearly afraid of a lot. But I promised him that I love him to pieces and the baby changes nothing. I also told him that I know we\u2019re technically half siblings and we\u2019re only 5 years apart but I care for him a lot and I kind of see him as my child. I also told him my boyfriend loves him in a similar way too. \n\nI was afraid that it would be a bit weird to say this but he smiled really hard and told me how he used to wish my bf and I were really his parents but felt embarrassed for thinking this so he never said anything. We just hugged and ahh we\u2019re not the best with feelings but it was nice. \n\nHe turns 18 in Feb and I plan on having him move in for good by the end of Jan. My dad and I no longer speak at all after he sent me a very mean message. My mom and I only speak to talk about my brother moving in with me and getting all his legal stuff. She still asks about my sisters games but I always shut it down. She didn\u2019t ask when we last talked... progress? \n\nWe celebrated Christmas with my boyfriend\u2019s family and they all treated my brother so wonderfully. Also... my boyfriend\u2019s proposing soon and my brother\u2019s gonna be whatever the guy version of the maid of honour is. Overall, we\u2019ve been doing well and we have big things ahead of us. And I know we\u2019re a bit of an odd family but it makes my brother happy and that\u2019s really all that matters to me.

They haven't actually made any demands on OP, and OP doesn't mention them being rude or cruel to the brother in either the original post or the update.

I said they treat op with the same disregard they treat the brother (more so mom side since he isn\u2019t related to the stepsister). I also mention it was less harsh because they aren\u2019t actively (meaning no steps taken other than to exclude her) against her. But again, I never said they did anything to op. But if someone tells me I\u2019m not important enough to go to their recitals or if someone says \u201cI never cared for your or my brother\u201d for you to go to my games, there\u2019s a big lesson to be learned. Her sisters don\u2019t treat her with care, love, or respect because neither of her parents do. Dad hates her brother because he is an affair baby, and has replaced her with a new family. He only wants her at the dance recitals to take away from what little the brother has because he wants him to suffer. She didn\u2019t agree to his pseudo \u201cbut your sister\u201d so he stopped talking to her. Mom completely ignores the brother and since she doesn\u2019t live with them they follow their mom\u2019s lead. I\u2019m not saying they have to bend over backwards for anyone, but they should learn love, care, compassion, and respect for ALL people. I\u2019m glad op doesn\u2019t let this get to her but that level of indifference and misanthropy for family just because, it does get to some people. Like the brother for example, their indifference and disregard for his existence bothers him. Being \u201cnot close\u201d is completely different from \u2018your not important to share in my life\u2019 and \u2018I never wanted you around and don\u2019t care about you.\u2019", "Well I was adopted, and it kind of seemed like my dad thought of me as half a kid.", "Well now that is interesting.", "> But if someone tells me I\u2019m not important enough to go to their recitals or if someone says \u201cI never cared for your or my brother\u201d for you to go to my games, there\u2019s a big lesson to be learned. \n\n\nI don't know, I think it's a good thing that they're being honest. When I was younger, I didn't want my siblings to attend any of my events, either. (And to be honest, I wouldn't want them at any events these days either.) It just means I'm selective about who I want to watch me performing - I wasn't close with my siblings, so I didn't want them there. There's nothing wrong with that, and it certainly doesn't mean I lack compassion or care. Indifference isn't necessarily cruelty, and I think it's unfair to say they're following mom's lead based on one example. \n\nAnd going from 'I don't care if you attend my games' to 'I never wanted you around and don\u2019t care about you' is a really big leap.", "oh lordy, I was going for a joke about the .5 kids being just a pair of legs or the upper half getting around on arms, now it's just gotten real. I'm sorry you had to deal with that feeling lesser.", "Can anyone link to the first post?", "So many warm and fuzzies! I kinda got a contact high from all the obvious love in this post. Very happy for the three (and soon to be four!) of you!", "Thank you!", "I\u2019m not sure what you mean. She literally says her sisters said they don\u2019t care for her and her brother. The direct line is \u201c The ones on my mom\u2019s side straight up admitted that they don\u2019t care for my brother or I and never asked for me to go to their games.\u201d So not a big leap. They said \u201cI don\u2019t care about you and your brother\u201d FULL STOP AND \u201cI never asked you to attend.\u201d Like I said in my initial reply, there\u2019s a difference between not close and I don\u2019t care about you. And as you mentioned, you aren\u2019t close to your siblings but cared for them. Her siblings said they neither care nor do they want them around. Again, not a leap and very different from your situation. You are defending a point that a) wasn\u2019t made and b) doesn\u2019t apply. Since you me ruined your personal experience, I\u2019m assuming people made you feel like not wanting your siblings around meant you didn\u2019t care for them. And I believe indifferent means you don\u2019t care from my quick Google double check. Unless you said or felt those things towards your siblings, I don\u2019t find that to be the case for you. Being selective for whatever reason is different from, you aren\u2019t important enough to attend. You example seems to come from controlled stage freight or focus, not because you don\u2019t find them important. But as far as not caring, that is definitely the case for op and all her siblings. The treatment they exhibit is learned. If their parents treated him like a son they\u2019d treat him like a brother unless some outlier occurred. From op\u2019s description there was no outlier other than he was treated differently.", "I did misread that line. Though I still do think their honesty is better than what the parents are doing. I am indifferent to two of my siblings - I don't really care about them, except in the abstract. So I care about them as much as I'd care about a stranger, you know? Like if they were in serious trouble, like hurt or homeless, I'd care about that in the way I'd care about a stranger being hurt or homeless. \n\n And I truly don't think that's a bad thing. It's okay to distance yourself from your family, for any reason. \n\nSo yeah, to be honest, not wanting them at my events would be because I feel they aren't good enough to attend. I wouldn't use that wording, personally, but that is what it boils down to. They're not important to me, so they're not important to have at my events. \n\nOverall, I just really disagree that them not caring or wanting to be siblings means they have a lesson to learn.", "The lesson is empathy. A person lives in your home and has to deal with the bare minimum and zero familial interaction and that has zero effect on you as a person, is concerning. You are right, you can disengage from whoever for whatever reason. But they all watched him suffer and live a lonely life. Your willingness to defend and empathize with the sisters is very telling. Not good or bad, but telling that some of your words aren\u2019t true. You went from not wanting your siblings at your events and being indifferent, to you don\u2019t find them important to you and view them on level of strangers. So I don\u2019t fully believe you have a stranger based care for your siblings or actual strangers. If you can\u2019t generate empathy for people you know the life/history/backstory of, I truly doubt you have it for strangers. I won\u2019t be changing my comment. They have a lesson to learn. My comments are for op and her situation but you seem to defending your personal stance and choices. I don\u2019t know you or your situation enough to comment on it and what you did share you\u2019ve admitted wasn\u2019t necessarily true. You may not have a lesson to learn but the young ladies of this story most certainly do.", "I don't need to defend my personal choices. I don't really care if you think I have empathy or not, because I know I do. I also don't know why you're calling me a liar lol, but okay. To me, being indifferent means thinking of somebody as a stranger slash they aren't important to me. What else could indifferent mean? You're free to have your definition, but it doesn't mean my words weren't true my dude.\n\nBut I'll defend kids if I think they're being unfairly judged. The parents are obviously terrible people - I think there's a good chance that the sisters felt they had to follow their example, especially as they got older, or they'd risk being treated the same way. \n\nI know it's a wild concept to you, but I can feel sorry for all of the children in the situation, from OP and their sibling to the sisters.", "This is beautiful, OP! \n\nWhat a pair of sh@t parents.... and sisters, it's not really their fault, it's just what they've been exposed to. In this story the parents are defo the worst! I'm glad that you stood by your brother while no one else did!!\n\nWishing you all the best", "I love this update!", "Wait for OP's Mom and Dad trying to \"reconnect\" for the sake of their \"graaaandbaby\"! I hope OP stonewalls them h a r d!", "For sure...\n\nIt's ridiculous and sad. I mean, if the Mom didn't want to have a kid from that affair, she could have had an abortion or, god forbid, both her and the AP could've used Ironclad Birth Control? Better yet: No affair, how about that?", "They're defo projecting their failures onto the kid who has no fault in this at all! \n\nMy mother projects her husband onto me and he in turn projects his failures onto me as well. That way both live in \"peace\" and can excuse that they're shit and have lost everyone (their three children plus any relative or friend who doesn't go along with their idiotic decisions).\n\nOPs parents defo do the same but also worry about \"ooh, their public image\" so are bothered that their oldest is acting more like a parent to the kid than they ever did. Wouldn't be surprised if some people have noticed it and started asking some questions. Hence why that \"intervention\"!", ">They're defo projecting their failures onto the kid who has no fault in this at all!\n\nOh, yeah, no questions asked about that part! Just the sudden change is weird in my eyes. Disguisting, yes! But weird. But you could be right about people having taken notice now.", "I never called you a liar. Said you weren\u2019t truthful when you said you didn\u2019t want your siblings around then in your next reply said well they aren\u2019t important. You changed your stance twice in your comments. I didn\u2019t say you lied, which is different from not truthful. I also said I don\u2019t believe you care for strangers, I never said you weren\u2019t empathetic. I even said you were empathetic to the girls who said they didn\u2019t care about her. I literally called you empathetic in my comment. I said the girls in op\u2019s post weren\u2019t. You are free to defend whoever you like. You are also free to defend it on a standalone comment if you don\u2019t want my replies. You brought up your personal life for discussion, so I commented on it as presented. You are making this about you. I am commenting on op, her brother, and her sisters. As I\u2019ve suggested, your personal life and experiences have not and will not be factored into my comments because, again, I don\u2019t know you. My initial commentary is exclusively to op, I even went so far as to distance your life from my comments by making clear distinctions to emphasize it wasn\u2019t relevant to the information op presented. I also posted the direct line from op to show where HER experience was different to YOUR experience. But you continued to make my comments about you. You are free to continue to discuss/defend/contribute/validate your choices but they will not affect or change my comments on what OP has posted.\n\nHappy New Year, btw", "Ok so what's the difference between \"not being truthful\" and lying? One is literally the definition of the other. You say you don't believe I have empathy, but then you say you never said I'm not empathic? Lol ok. \nIt feels like you just like to play word games at this point, so I guess I'll stop playing.", "Congratulations \n\nBTW; I\u2019ve heard The Male in The bride\u2019s party referred to as: \u201cA Bride\u2019s Knight\u201d", "Dude of Honour. Bridesman. Bridesbro.", "[Original post, BTW](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zg5y83/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_sisters/)", "So sorry your parents let you down like that. It\u2019s hard when people you\u2019re supposed to be able to depend on do that. But you are doing a wonderful job creating a new life for yourself with people who truly love you. Best of luck and much happiness!", "Dudesmaid", "Gentleman of Honor/Gent of Honor.", "Aww, thanks. It's ok though, as I've gotten older I've started to realize that if he'd been able to have biological children he probably would've treated them the same way. He just didn't really know how to be a dad.", "A friend of mine had a \u201cman of honor\u201d at her wedding! \n\nCongratulations and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to make a little family with your brother and fianc\u00e9!"]}
