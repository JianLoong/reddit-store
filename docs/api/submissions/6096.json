I really appreciated them. Idk how to express this lol but I\u2019m grateful.\n\nThe update:\n\nAfter reading all the comments on my post, I decided to talk to my sisters on both sides about what my parents told me. Well, the one on my dad\u2019s side said that she doesn\u2019t see me as important enough to watch her perform. The ones on my mom\u2019s side straight up admitted that they don\u2019t care for my brother or I and never asked for me to go to their games. \n\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t care. We don\u2019t actively hate each other or anything and are civil at best. My step sister (dad\u2019s side) prefers being on her own and my half sisters (mom\u2019s side) know very well that I\u2019m much closer to my brother than them. Maybe if our parents weren\u2019t terrible, things could\u2019ve been different but it is what it is. \n\nFrom now on, I will no longer be going to my sisters things unless they ask me. I have a very demanding job and I just found out I\u2019m pregnant so I won\u2019t have time at all. \n\nSpeaking of me being pregnant, my brother was the first person my boyfriend and I told and he was clearly afraid of a lot. But I promised him that I love him to pieces and the baby changes nothing. I also told him that I know we\u2019re technically half siblings and we\u2019re only 5 years apart but I care for him a lot and I kind of see him as my child. I also told him my boyfriend loves him in a similar way too. \n\nI was afraid that it would be a bit weird to say this but he smiled really hard and told me how he used to wish my bf and I were really his parents but felt embarrassed for thinking this so he never said anything. We just hugged and ahh we\u2019re not the best with feelings but it was nice. \n\nHe turns 18 in Feb and I plan on having him move in for good by the end of Jan. My dad and I no longer speak at all after he sent me a very mean message. My mom and I only speak to talk about my brother moving in with me and getting all his legal stuff. She still asks about my sisters games but I always shut it down. She didn\u2019t ask when we last talked... progress? \n\nWe celebrated Christmas with my boyfriend\u2019s family and they all treated my brother so wonderfully. Also... my boyfriend\u2019s proposing soon and my brother\u2019s gonna be whatever the guy version of the maid of honour is. Overall, we\u2019ve been doing well and we have big things ahead of us. And I know we\u2019re a bit of an odd family but it makes my brother happy and that\u2019s really all that matters to me.

I'm happy you spent Christmas away from them. You really might want to cut them out, as that what happened was very out of order. Why would they want you to go to your sister's recitals when your sister didn't even ask it? That's really weird. And the fact they tried to guilt you into it, proves how much of HAs they are. It's good to see you have good ILs. :) You already doing so much for your brother, proves how awesome of a sister and human you are! \n\nThat fact your parents didn't allow you in their houses proves how terrible they are. :(", "...Is that dust in my eye? It must be.....\n\nGood for you. How sad for your parents that they felt they had to LIE to you to somehow make you share your attention with their other children. \n\nI'm sure there's a psychological term for it, but it is super-disturbing that instead of being proud that you are doing so much for your brother, that they are trying to carve up your time so their (completely disinterested) younger step- and half-siblings get some too.\n\nLike your attention is a giant cake and \"*they want a piece too\"*. Ignore them!\n\nOP, you're going to make a great parent, and your BF sounds fantastic. Good luck to all of you!", "Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zg5y83/aita\\_for\\_refusing\\_to\\_go\\_to\\_my\\_sisters/", "Wow, your parents are projecting their resentment of each other on your brother or something. Well to a prosperous year with your little family. At least your baby will have 2 happy parents and a happy uncle \ud83d\ude42", "Very happy for you. Having checked in with your sisters, your parents really don't have any excuse to badger you about it. Kinda sucks that you're not closer to them, but none of you seem all that bothered by it, and at least they have parents. So glad your brother has you. It's unconventional, sure, but not where it matters most.", "OP you\u2019re such an amazing and loving sister! I wish more sisters like you existed \u2764\ufe0f", "So glad you talked to the sisters!  I am like sis 2, I never cared if people showed up.", "It is disgusting for your parents to punish your brother for existing. He is innocent. \n\nYou're a fabulous sister and will be a great mom.", "Thanks for the update, I love happy endings!", "Wow, thanks for update and I wish you, and your BF/fianc\u00e9 a wonderful future.", "> whatever the guy version of the maid of honour is\n\nIt is the \"Best man\". A \"[Groomsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groomsman)\".\n\nCongratulations.", "OP, I\u2019m so happy for you and your brother. It\u2019s only natural to feel some sort of\u2026.sadness? Anger? Frustration? at your parents for how they have handled all of this but you and your brother are better off, and it sounds as if your bf\u2019s family is just as amazing as he is. \n\nWishing you guys all the best, and all the happiness going forward. This could have destroyed your brother, especially as he moves closer to adulthood, but having you and your bf being a good steady influence will make all the difference in his - and your - life!", "NTA-- I'm do happy for your family (you, your boyfriend, your brother and your baby). You are a wonderful sister and you guys deserve ALL the best!", "The term for a man in the position of what would normally be the maid of honor is called a \"man of honor\".", "Wow I\u2019m so glad your brother has you. I don\u2019t get why some parents don\u2019t get that their special blended family won\u2019t just magically happen with no effort on their part.", "Such a great update OP!  Glad you and your boyfriend are going the extra mile to make your brother feel worthy.", "I\u2019m glad you got a chance to talk to your sisters and know how they really feel. There\u2019s no way they didn\u2019t know your sisters don\u2019t like you. They treat you the same way they treat your brother, just less harsh. They don\u2019t actually care about you and your time. They just don\u2019t want it going towards your brother. I hope your parents and sisters learn from this before it\u2019s too late.", "I am so happy to hear this. Congratulations on your pregnancy and I wish nothing but the best for you and your wee family.", "You are such a good person and so is your boyfriend! You showed compassion to your brother; you made him feel like he wasn't alone. You and your boyfriend will be good parents, much better than your mother and father. It's refreshing to read a story like yours on here because a lot of the posts are the exact opposite.", "WOW, this is a wonderful update.  Your brother's so lucky to have you as an older sister looking out for him.  He'll be your man of honor, which i'm sure makes him very proud.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy.  I'm sure your brother will be a devoted uncle (perhaps Godfather) to your little one.  All the best", "It seems they also wanted OP to alienate a child that didn't ask to be born... *What a great set of parents* smh", "She already is a great parent and I mean to both, this child has it made and OP\u2019s brother, I think I have finally realized why this is such a big deal to OP\u2019s parents, OP\u2019s love and devotion to the brother makes them look bad, I am kind\u2019ve confused about OP\u2019s brother\u2019s parent, I am assuming its the Mother bcuz he lives with her but whoever isn\u2019t the affair partner somehow they feel threatened by OP and her boyfriend\u2019s love for the boy as well. NTA. But I can guess both parents feel jealous of OP\u2019s affection for the boy and treatment bcuz they are simply not up to par.", "I think she means he will be her MoH and usually the term is Man of Honor.", "That OPs dad wants OPs brother alienated is no surprise, since the young man is not his child, and came from the affair that destroyed his first marriage.\n\nHee mom probably holds a certain amount of resentment towards her son on this too. Resentment that would be pure projection of her own failings onto a child that, as you say, didn't ask to be born. Attempts to alienate her son in favor of her younger daughters are also not surprising.\n\nThere's a saying I ran across that I think describes OPs parents.\n\n>There is no such thing as an illegitimate child, only illegitimate parents.\n\nI think it is safe to say OP will be a more legit parent than her parents are being. Her own actions in supporting her brother are evidence enough of that. His expressed feelings of wishing OP and her BF were his parents only amplify it.", "OP's brother could be in both wedding parties since he is close from both OP and her fianc\u00e9 but I think OP refers to him being in her wedding party, which normalky are bridesmaids and maid of honor.", "Yep and usually the male version is Man of Honor."]}
