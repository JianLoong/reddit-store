I really appreciated them. Idk how to express this lol but I\u2019m grateful.\n\nThe update:\n\nAfter reading all the comments on my post, I decided to talk to my sisters on both sides about what my parents told me. Well, the one on my dad\u2019s side said that she doesn\u2019t see me as important enough to watch her perform. The ones on my mom\u2019s side straight up admitted that they don\u2019t care for my brother or I and never asked for me to go to their games. \n\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t care. We don\u2019t actively hate each other or anything and are civil at best. My step sister (dad\u2019s side) prefers being on her own and my half sisters (mom\u2019s side) know very well that I\u2019m much closer to my brother than them. Maybe if our parents weren\u2019t terrible, things could\u2019ve been different but it is what it is. \n\nFrom now on, I will no longer be going to my sisters things unless they ask me. I have a very demanding job and I just found out I\u2019m pregnant so I won\u2019t have time at all. \n\nSpeaking of me being pregnant, my brother was the first person my boyfriend and I told and he was clearly afraid of a lot. But I promised him that I love him to pieces and the baby changes nothing. I also told him that I know we\u2019re technically half siblings and we\u2019re only 5 years apart but I care for him a lot and I kind of see him as my child. I also told him my boyfriend loves him in a similar way too. \n\nI was afraid that it would be a bit weird to say this but he smiled really hard and told me how he used to wish my bf and I were really his parents but felt embarrassed for thinking this so he never said anything. We just hugged and ahh we\u2019re not the best with feelings but it was nice. \n\nHe turns 18 in Feb and I plan on having him move in for good by the end of Jan. My dad and I no longer speak at all after he sent me a very mean message. My mom and I only speak to talk about my brother moving in with me and getting all his legal stuff. She still asks about my sisters games but I always shut it down. She didn\u2019t ask when we last talked... progress? \n\nWe celebrated Christmas with my boyfriend\u2019s family and they all treated my brother so wonderfully. Also... my boyfriend\u2019s proposing soon and my brother\u2019s gonna be whatever the guy version of the maid of honour is. Overall, we\u2019ve been doing well and we have big things ahead of us. And I know we\u2019re a bit of an odd family but it makes my brother happy and that\u2019s really all that matters to me.
