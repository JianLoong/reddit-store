One year together, she\u2019s bringing four kids into this, you\u2019re footing 100% of all the expenses in addition to attorney/legal fees to protect her youngest? She\u2019s on easy street and bringing absolutely nothing to the table, but she still wants to be guaranteed half of your life anyway? No sir. Under no circumstances should you put her on the deed.", "NTA, runaway", "Never never never and I find it really shady that she\u2019s demanding that. You are one year I am paying her attorney bills? What else does she demand? I doubt that insisting on half your equity because it\u2019ll make her feel better is the only request she\u2019s made in the year.", "NTA. You fully paid for this house. You really haven\u2019t been with her that long, but it sounds like you\u2019ve already done a whole lot for this family. Not a bad thing, but you are putting your home at risk if you add her.", "NTA but you would have to be a giant idiot to agree to that. I think you are foolish for even being with a single mother of four with multiple baby daddies. Especially when you have one child of your own. That's too many people in one house. You bought the house with your money, you aren't married, dating only a year, and she wants to be on the deed. If you do get married sign a prenup.", "NAH. I get her concerns about security for her and her kids too. You bought the house, it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re not married. You have every right and reason to refuse this and she is more than welcome to not move in with you.", "If I\u2019m interpreting this right, she is moving in with you and using all her money to go to college rather than supporting herself and her children and she\u2019s worried she\u2019s going to get a bad deal?\n\nShe is right to be concerned about having a safety net should something go wrong in your relationship. Do not promise you\u2019ll never just kick her out, because honestly, you should have the ability to do so within reason. People split up and move out all the time, even from rental situations where both are on the lease. \n\nBut she _should_ have a safety net. Her error is in thinking that somehow it\u2019s on you to provide it.  Encourage her to _not_ become dependent on you. Maybe she needs to work for another year before college so she can save up for an emergency first month/last month plus a week or two in a hotel. Maybe there is another solution she can think of. But half your house is not the solution.", "NTA.  Do not do it.  Once she is on the deed she is entitled to half of the value of the house.  \nIf she lives there, you can\u2019t just kick her out.   She would have tenant rights and you would have to give notice and a time frame to her to move.  That time frame can vary based on where you live.", "INFO: You are paying for the house all yourself, with no financial input from your GF but she \\*still\\* wants to be put on the lease?\n\nAnd why would you have to move in with your parents if you don't get the house/move in together?\n\nETA judgment after info give:\n\nNAH Neither of you are assholes. I see exactly where you're coming from. And I see exactly where she's coming from. And if you both can be objective about this, you both are coming from the same place. Your relationship is still comparatively new. I would have a different opinion if you had been together for multiple years but at this point, it's more of 'I really, really hope this works out!!' than a 'Oh, it's forever and ever!', it seems. you both are trying to protect yourself just in case. Neither of you are AHs.", "NAH. I think you're both trying to feel protected. Maybe try looking in to creating a tenancy agreement that guarantees her right to live there while you're together and entitles her to a grace period to find new lodging if the relationship  ends and you \"evict\" her.  Such an agreement might benefit you as well in that case by legally establishing her as your tenant and not a person who has rights to the property beyond what you choose to grant.", "I think something like a lease agreement is a good idea. Having something on paper might allay both your worries. You can sit down together, talk it out, make it fair, have a lawyer look at it. I'm going to say NAH as far as judgements go, you both have valid concerns", "She is a loving mother. She has some crazy ideas in my opinion but would do anything for my kid as much as hers.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve offered an opportunity that even if our relationship went sideways she would be able to provide a good life for the kids, which is important to me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I understand and respect her concerns, but unless y'all got married, I don't see a reason for her to be on the title.\n\nEven in the case of a divorce, you can show evidence it was bought prior to marriage and she still wouldn't get any of it (generally).\n\nMy only suggestion is to tell her she is welcome to stay if she chooses but be prepared for the relationship to probably eventually end if she refuses.", "That's even more of a red flag.  Sounds like she's using you.", "A five year lease is a terrible idea as well. A year to year lease until you\u2019re married is more than fair.", "Which is more important: a stable lifetime home for your children or a comparative stranger who could force the sale that home (partition sale)? Rose colored glasses or thinking with the wrong head.", "And don\u2019t you pay for further education for her, as a single mother of four she will qualify 100% for financial aid.", "I think there are downvotes because people are a bit skittish about her insistence to be on the deed. Based on this and only 1 year of dating, I say NTA, but you may want to rethink this whole relationship.", "I hope as you\u2019re answering people\u2019s questions you\u2019re starting to see a pattern.", "Your son MUST always be your first priority. Do not put yourself in a situation where you lose your home", "I don't think you answered my first question. Is she or is she not helping you pay your mortgage?", "Notice that there is a pull there for you to be the \u201cnot terrible\u201d one who loves her and supports her and does as she asks. It\u2019s not your job to prove that you are not them. If she\u2019s asking it if you, she needs therapy, not a boyfriend.", "Yeah, but now you\u2019re offering to support and parent and pay for her kids and for some reason in her mind, that\u2019s just not enough. If your Reddit handle has anything to do with your career, I\u2019d like to mention that I\u2019ve seen this story happen in the oilfield over and over and over again. The only twist is she\u2019s not pregnant already.  (I took early retirement from my job headhunting engineers in the E&P space.)", "Thank you! I didn\u2019t realize until abt 30 mins ago, lol", "I think my state is 1$ but even if it was 60k I\u2019d write a check so it is a 0=0 scenario.", "I feel like this woman has been kicked out before", "Maybe even a 6 month lease based on her actions.", "Not paying mortgage.", "Oilfield\u2026. Busted", "Mmmm, cake!", "This woman has, and her and her children would have been homeless if it weren\u2019t for family. Stay at home mom for 7 years and one day my husband decided he didn\u2019t want this anymore. I am protecting my children.", "Okay then. It's a simple thing then. No mortgage, not on deed. ESPECIALLY since you all aren't married or even engaged with a wedding in a few months, right?", "That sounds terrible, but you\u2019re not her", "No wedding."]}
