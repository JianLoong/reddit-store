I feel like that shouldn't need more explaining. She's been a cruel, ableist person for a long time now. She's disrespected you, she's disrespected your partner, and she's already trying to hedge her bets with your kid. You didn't \"disrespect\" her, you protected your people from her bullshit.

She made mean comments about your husband's muteness in front of guests, and refused to listen to your perspective on the matter. It was understandable that you would ask her to leave your house after she disrespected your partner in such a way. You have every right to set boundaries and demand respect in your own home. It is not fair for your step mother to try to impose her narrow-minded views on you and your partner, and it was appropriate for you to stand up for your husband and your relationship. It is understandable that your father is upset with you for asking his wife to leave, but it is ultimately your decision to make in your own home.\n \n\n**TL;DR:** Step mother was disrespectful, made mean comments about husband's muteness.

Your stepmother was being rude and mean so why put up with it when your and your partner are better off without stepmother's bad behaviour ruining the good mood in your own home", "NTA - This was so disrespectful , your dad sucks too , you were just stand up for your partner", "NTA, I would have done worse if I were you. Seriously, your Stepmom is an AH and deserved to be treated as such. If your father cannot understand why you acted as you did and why she is the one at fault, I suggest you don't involve either of them in yours and your future child's life. Imagine if your child learn from them what disability is and how it should be treated.", "NTA", "I\u2019m so glad they are out of your home.  She was so rude to your husband.  Let these people go their own way, and you go yours.", "NTA.\n\nYou're better off without \"Nice\" \"Parents\". She is way out of line inviting people into HIS HOME and disrespecting him to them. What a shallow piece of work.\n\nYour father's response shows what **he** thinks of your husband too. If your father doesn't support protecting your husband from abuse, he believes the exact same things she does. He's just too chicken to say it.\n\n**Never. Let. Them. Meet. Your. Children.**\n\n**They WILL ACTIVELY \"find\" things \"wrong\" with your children and treat them the EXACT same way as your husband, except your children won't be capable of processing the indiscriminate hate appropriately.**\n\nAlso, I would only insist he continues treatment if it makes him more hopeful and not more hopeless. You can always try again when new treatments come out.", "Your stepmom is utterly entitled to her opinions. I think all kinds of things that would upset others. That stops the minute she opens her mouth and SHARES that opinion. You were utterly right.

She thinks it's ok to disrespect him in his own house, and so does your dad since he thinks you're the one in the wrong here. It sure was nice for her to take care of you when you were sick, but that doesn't give her the right to smack talk your husband. You didn't say anything wrong, keep defending him.", "NTA.", "NTA, for all the reasons others are saying.\n\nBut... I  finding you kind of an ass in general regarding your husband's muteness. It seems like you want him cured and don't accept that he is mute and may always be. From how you worded the post it seems like you pushed him back into therapy when he was fine without it. And even in your defense of him you defended that he will get the ability to talk again rather than saying that his muteness doesn't matter.", "NTA. They can go fuck themselves. He\u2019s deaf not some kind of sociopaths. So disrespectful", "I find OP an ass in general for that. It seems as if she doesn't accept and respect her husband being mute.

He is indeed mute."]}
