Why should her enjoyment of the trip count any more than yours?\n\nAnd all of this is completely ignoring your travel sickness - having a seat where you can see the landscape is a pretty well known way of helping to limit travel sickness, and I am pretty sure sitting in the aisle without a view next to a quiet person beats getting blocked in against the window by someone being loudly sick for the journey...\n\nIf she wants a window seat, she should book earlier and request one - something I am sure will be possible to do through whichever booking office she used if age and inability to use the internet is the problem here.", "NTA", "NTA.

Less respect is \"earned\" as well, so you shouldnt treat anyone as less without good reason imo", "That's a mighty broad brush with which you paint there, pardner.
