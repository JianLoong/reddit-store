My husband (24m) and I (25f) share the same friend group going back to high school. One of our friends \u201cRick\u201d had recently started seeing his now-wife, \u201cSarah\u201d. Sarah seemed cool at first, and I was happy to have her as a new friend.\n\nOne day we got together at their place for a Halloween party. It ended up being a disaster. During the party, Sarah started yelling at Rick, calling him names, slammed doors, etc. She eventually went on an angry nighttime drive and Rick threw up in the bathroom from anxiety. When she returned, she dumped a milkshake on his head and then expected *us* to apologize for \u201cexcluding her\u201d the previous day, despite the fact that I had gone out of my way to hang out with her and get to know her more. I decided after that night that I wanted nothing to do with her ever again, and my husband agreed as well.\n\nThe next day my husband and I explained to Rick that her behavior towards him was abusive, and that he didn\u2019t deserve to be treated that way. We expressed our concern for him and his well-being. We also stated that while we were happy to hang out with him, we no longer wanted to have any contact with Sarah from that moment onwards. He understood, and didn\u2019t seem to have an issue with this.\n\nFast forward to a few months later, my husband was in the process of moving in with me from out of state (we had been doing long distance for a year). I was staying with my grandparents at that time, and they agreed to let my husband stay with us. Rick was planning to fly down to help my husband move. Rick ended up missing his flight, but decided he was going to drive down to help him move. This was fine enough, but it wasn\u2019t until the 11th hour that he admitted that he brought Sarah with him, and they were already on their way over. They were roughly 3 hours in, and it would take another 4+ to arrive.\n\nMy husband and I were not happy about this, but I was the one who ultimately put my foot down. I refused to allow Sarah to come for multiple reasons. One being that Rick had already agreed to us never being around Sarah again. The second reason being that I wasn\u2019t going to let her into my grandparents house when they didn\u2019t deserve unnecessary drama. Thirdly, even if I was okay with it, I knew my grandparents wouldn\u2019t be.\n\nSarah was livid, but turned around and went home. Rick still helped my husband move his things in when he arrived, and was still friendly with me at this time. However, over the months he tried to convince us to give Sarah another chance. My husband eventually decided to, but I chose not to. I figured my husband can be friends with whoever, and I don\u2019t need to be a part of it. However, Rick seems to have officially ghosted us and refuses to speak to us now. I feel as if I\u2019m solely responsible for the destruction of my husband\u2019s friendship with Rick. I literally just didn\u2019t want to be involved with Sarah.

What a terrifying and abusive woman", "NTA - Sarah thrives on drama. Sarah is responsible for that destruction, not you.", "NTA - You\u2019ve refused to enable an abusive relationship. That\u2019s it. You drew a boundary and Rick ignored it and then faced the consequences of doing that.", "NTA. You didn't ruin the friendship. Sarah ruined it because ultimately Rick let her. You did not do a thing wrong here.", "Um, definitely NTA, Sarah sounds unhinged. She is the AH in this situation. I\u2019m tempted to say Rick too but he may be trapped in an abusive relationship so he gets the benefit of the doubt. The only ones to blame for Rick losing his friends is Rick and Sarah. \n\nThis sub never ceases to amaze me with the crazy behavior of grown ass adults.", "NTA for drawing healthy boundaries. \n\nBut, what is your husband's take on this? Is he bothered that Rick has gone no contact, or does he blame you for it? Regardless of the answer though, ultimately the friendship ended because Sarah was abusive and started drama.\n\nI hope your friend Rick gets free from her.", "NTA. Rick will realize his mistakes soon enough", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband made it clear that you did not want to be involved with Sarah after her abusive behavior towards Rick. It was reasonable for you to refuse her entry into your grandparents' house, especially when they didn't deserve unnecessary drama. You even gave your husband the option to remain friends with Rick and Sarah, while you chose not to be involved. It's not your fault that Rick chose to ghost you both. It seems like he valued his relationship with Sarah more than his friendship with you and your husband.", "NTA at all. Being friends with someone does not mean they are entitled to cause you trouble and anxiety. It doesn't mean that you have to put up with rudeness and disrespect. It's unfortunate that Rick is currently unable to acknowledge the toxicity of his wife and leave but you don't have to put up with this unnecessary stress from her and if he wants to cut both of you from his life because you refuse to be subjected to this level of disrespect as well as see him be disrespected by his wife then it's not something you should blame yourself for at all.", "[removed]", "NTA. I learned long ago, sometimes the only way to save yourself is to cut out friends who are hurting you or your loved ones. Be glad she is gone.", "NTA. You didn't destroy the friendship, she did. An abuser naturally wants to isolate their victim from friends and family.", "I don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re TA but I don\u2019t see any way for you guys to remain friends. It\u2019s unreasonable to maintain any kind of relationship with him in person without ever seeing his significant other again. \n\nBest case scenario is when they break up, he comes back around and you guys can talk it out. \n\nObviously her behavior is insane. Any normal person would not want to be around her. Especially without some severe soul searching and apology lol.", "NTA for setting reasonable boundaries. Not sure if Rick actually told Sarah (at least prior to her having to turn around) or if he was too afraid of her back then to tell her; but she is definitely TA if all of this because either she knew and tried to come uninvited or she abused him into this level of submission.", "NTA - these things come and go over time. Rick has chosen her over the friendship, and you'll just have to let that be his choice.", "Sarah is the asshole for abusing her partner\nYou just set clear boundaries. \nNTA", "NTA - if it were a man that was abusive to a female friend no one would be questioning your actions. Be there for him when he realises how damaging she is to him.", "NTA - is what I'm leaning to.  But this is a tough one - you haven't given us much apart from one day where she went off.  Is this a pattern of behaviour or was there something else going on that you just don't know about?  \n\nYou didn't really explain what happened the 'day before' the party - did you hang out with Rick and not invite her or something?    \n\nIf Rick is your friend, and you intended to keep him as a friend, you could try to give her a second chance - particularly if this relationship seems serious.  Maybe tell her how upset you were about her carry on at the halloween party - give her an opportunity to apologise or express some remorse.  If she can't do that, and continues to be belligerent, then you can honestly say you gave her a chance.  You don't have to be best friends - you can keep her at arms length, but not have to totally exclude her.  You certainly shouldn't stop your husband from being friends with them - you can choose to exclude yourself.\n\nI feel bad for Rick - if it turns out she is a major AH and it is a pattern of behaviour, he may need his friends down the track.........", "NTA\n\nYou set a reasonable boundary, and you had no reason to reverse said boundary to accommodate someone else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would have left before Sarah came back and rampaged some more at the party. (My life can be messy enough. I don't want to be bothered with somebody else's mess, frankly.) But, after that I would have kept my distance from the poison pair of them. As much as I might love and respect and enjoy Rick, if he lives for drama? I'm out.\n\nSo, I don't blame you for not wanting to deal with Sarah. And the real problem is that Sarah and Rick aren't healthy together. Nothing you can actually do about that.\n\nIf my husband outright asked me to make peace with Sarah, I would consider doing so. But, I'd be content to leave her alone for all time. And I would not care about losing Rick. Dealing with him comes at a high price.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I don't think you ruined your husband and Rick's friendship. Rick is the victim of an abusive relationship. If anyone is an asshole, it's Sarah.", "NTA.  I think Rick finally succumbed to the succubus and she probably poisoned him against you both.", "NTA. Is Rick okay? How could he possibly be okay with a woman who dumped a milkshake on his head? Even if the sex is that good, I dont think it is worth it to be with an abusive woman like that.", "NTA\n\nYou do not have to like your friends partners. You do not need to be friends with everyone your partner is. Hopefully Rick sees that Sarah is alienating him from his friends", "NTA.\n\nYour husband seems willing to give Sarah a chance. So it doesn\u2019t look like their friendship is ruined. \n\nYou not willing to participate or interact with Sarah can be a none issue if managed well. Plenty of people have managed to never interact with significant other of their spouses friends. \n\nBut be firm with your husband that you will not interfere with his friendship but he and the friend should not push Sarah on you.", "If Sarah is in therapy, or apologize maybe get her a chance. If not no", "Hey, I'm the husband, and Rick was my best friend at one point so it was really hard to see this happen, however I don't blame my wife. I definitely blame Sarah most of all; the most I could say on our end is that we pushed for him to break up with her which maybe wasn't our place to say. I've made my peace with what happened and tried hard to fix things, but it was ultimately Rick who ghosted us. I just hope he ends up happy in the end.", "And they ended up forcing Rick to choose & isolating him.", "\"Rick, I know you love your woman, but, your woman is not our shared problem. Please leave me out of this mess.\"", "I don't blame you for wondering about the day before the Halloween party - I had it in my original post when I tried to submit it, but was way over the word count. So basically, we were going to meet up to go rock wall climbing. Sarah hung back because she had lost her wallet. I offered that we could help her look for it, but Rick claimed that Sarah told us to continue without her because she had another friend who was helping her look for her wallet. I felt iffy about that at the time, but I didn't know her as well as Rick, so I figured we'd just heed his advice. Also, I had hung out with Sarah at the mall before this period, and we bonded over different fandoms, interests, etc. and I had invited her to go check out some other shops when the guys were looking at games.\n\nOne of our friends has given her a second chance, and hung out with both her and Rick for a while after Rick decided he didn't want to be friends with us. But according to our friend, Sarah easy to become offended and acts controlling even at those get togethers. It kinda surprised me to hear, because this friend in particular is usually pretty accepting of most people.", "Nah mate.\n\nThat's what best friends are for. The best friend, of all people, should be able to give it to their best friend straight.\n\nAcquaintances have no say in someone's life. Best friends do. I love the fact that you just want him to be happy, even if he continues no contact with you.\n\nRick was a lucky guy to have you in his life.", "Abusers like to isolate their victims. She might be keeping him from having friends or any kind of support system.", "Dude I'm sorry but she did what abusive people do and isolated him. I would send Rick an email letting him know that you'll always be there for ***him*** if he needs you and then drop the rope. You're extending a lifeline he may remember if he ever wakes up and jumps from the abusive ship.", "NTA\n\nSarah's abusive. Abuser cut their victims off from other people and supports and isolate them, as it makes their victims easier to control and more likely to stay.\n\nIf it hadn't been that it would have been something else. That's what ended the friendship, nothing else. And while there can be benefit in staying in touch with someone in an abusive relationship so they know they have support, there is also benefit is standing up and saying this is wrong, and I don't want to be around it.\n\nIf your husband is blaming you he is verging into asshole territory.  It's definitely not your faul the friendship ended. It might be worth talking to a domestic violence charity to see if there are ways he can resume contact without endangering anyone.", "NTA - But can I ask if it was only that one time she was weird/abusive etc why she couldn't have one more chance, she was a newbie in a new friend group and was probably worried about making a good impression and turned into someone even she may not have recognized... just playing devils advocate here sorry", " nta but sarah might be forcing him to not speak to you, abusers often isolate their victims and destroy relationships to ensure total dependency. i understand that you dont want her in your life but i wouldn\u2019t leave rick in this situation. ultimatums to people in abusive relationships are rarely helpful to the victims. its not your responsibility but he might not be able to \u201cjust leave her\u201d. domestic violence is a tricky situation and even moreso for male victims. you obviously have to protect your own peace, but i would fake friendships with this absolute dropkick so i could remain in the close circle of my friend. ig that might not work for you guys but thats what i would do.", "But was it just that one incident? I was wonder why she couldn't have had a second chance maybe she was overwhelmed... NTA both of you but for your friend's sake????", "nta. Rick needs to raise his standards. the bar is practically underground and she is digging a tunnel under it"]}
