Not everyone can handle watching their loved ones be cut open and you let her know well ahead of time and you are working on it in therapy. I am honestly shocked by the ones calling you an ah.

Of course you don\u2019t WANT to be there to witness your wife having a major surgery. But if you felt scared, uncomfortable, helpless- how tf do you think your wife felt while having 7 layers of her body cut through and her baby yanked out while she was awake? Because you couldn\u2019t handle just standing next to her and holding her hand when she needed you most in life. News flash OP- no one likes the hospital or going into an operating room.", "NAH, except for MIL. She's the AH of this story. \n\nYour trauma and experiences are valid and if you had a reaction during the procedure it would have detracted from the medical staff from focusing on your wife to get you out of the room. Anyone telling you to \"man up\" is disregarding your trauma.\n\nOn the flip side, your wife was probably terrified. C-sections are traumatic in their own right and she could have died during birth regardless of which method she chose. At the end of the day, her life was the one at risk so I can't blame her for being scared in the moment.\n\nI guess what I wonder is why a compromised couldn't be reached. You go in and talk with her a bit before the procedure starts then exit the room. Is simply going into ORs a trigger for you?\n\nRegardless, ask her to join you for a therapy session or look into couple's therapy to discuss and work through this issue before resentment truly builds. At this point it's about working through the issue.", "YTA\n\nYou abandoned your wife during one if the most stressful and dangerous parts of her life.

She would have delivered alone had her mom not been with her!", "ESH. You could have found a way to manage being there with her. But it also sounds like this was an elective c-section that she chose knowing your situation. I find it odd that someone would choose a c-section if it's not medically necessary in the first place.", "NAH. Seems to be a lot of keyboard warriors or just man-haters in these comments. You have trauma, and you're actively trying to heal, AND your wife agreed beforehand.\n\nSeems a lot of people in these comments don't understand how bad hospital PTSD can be, I went through a horrific event this year and I'm not over it at all.\n\nI will say though, I personally would fight through the trauma to try and be there for my partner, and I do feel your wife's frustration, but I still don't think you fucked up.", "NTA", "I  don't think you are... You're been through something very traumatic and only you know how hard that is to deal with. The thing about pregnant women is there absolutely mean as hell... I was one, I hated everyone and everything..  didn't matter what they said or did I hated them... I will say I did hold alot against my partner when now I know I was being unreasonable. Pregnant women go through alot and if its her first she will have been absolutely crapping bricks! But you'd already explained all of the issues so personally I think your wife and her family need to see it from your side and stop being so judgemental!", "YTA to me. If my husband couldn\u2019t be in the operating room for me in that situation, I think it would completely change the way I look at him. I think I would become too resentful to even continue the relationship. I couldn\u2019t imagine going through something that traumatic, while my husband couldn\u2019t simply stand there. To me, that\u2019s the equivalent of my father dying and my husband telling me \u201chey I can\u2019t go to the funeral because that will be too sad for me.\u201d Like I said though, that\u2019s just my perspective. Everybody is going to have their own perspective. I would really consider your wife\u2019s perspective, because if it\u2019s the same as mine, your absence in the operating room will destroy your relationship with her- so ask yourself if that\u2019s worth it.\n\nAlso, think about what you\u2019re saying about your past trauma. You\u2019re legit telling your wife \u201cif this becomes a life or death situation, I don\u2019t want to be in the room while you die. It\u2019ll be too sad for me.\u201d You\u2019re telling her you care more about your feelings than being there for your wife in her last few moments of life (if she were to die).", "Im going to go against the grain and say YTA. Her body went through so much change and stress and pain with the pregnancy alone, and then she's the one getting her stomach cut open to bring your child into the world, but you couldn't muster to strength to just stand next to her for a couple of minutes to support her? You're \"nervous\" but she's the one getting literally CUT open. Did you even think about that? You sound incredibly self-absorbed.", "YTA. Suck it up. Your wife is going through hell and asked you for one thing.", "YTA. You're willing to working through your \"issues\" for your nose job, but not to be with your wife while your child is being born. You didn't set a \"boundary\" because you have an issue. You just didn't want to do it. Hope you enjoyed 2 sets of alimony and child support.", "NTA. You had made sure she was aware you wouldn't be in there if she had a c section multiple times. And not just that you had a valid reason. I had a c section and my partner was in there with me.

The MIL is kind of an AH tho..", "Dude\u2026NTA. \n\nPeople\u2019s comments are acting like she didn\u2019t agree to it.

Give me a fucking break. \n\nPeople are acting like you can choose to shut off your anxiety and trauma. She AGREED to it! Multiple times.

My husband and I are talking about kids, and I made it clear if he isn't there with me short of a medical emergency , there will be no 2nd kid ever.  You were in your right, but she is also allowed to be upset and to never have a 2nd kid with you.", "YTA because your wife didn\u2019t have the option of tapping out. I swear to god men are useless infants", "NTA: Her and her mother are. You told her your boundary and she agreed to your boundary.", "NTA-however, I do really feel for your wife.

You could have been with her and then left before she actually got cut open. Learn to compromise or your marriage will fall apart. YTA.", "NTA. You placed your limit , she was aware of it, and you stood by it. Her mother was there. Now, if the situation had been extra stressful because your MIL had gotten in a car crash on the way to the hospital and your wife had been worrying and alone, then, yeah, I think a discussion on whether to overstep your limits can be had.

You're being a shit partner for not being there for her and she's being a shit partner for wanting you to break a boundary you set ahead of time. \n\n I've had a very traumatic vaginal birth and an emergency c-section. Both were scary, painful, and traumatic for different reasons. Giving birth tends to be ugly and traumatic and if you can't cope, what's going to happen if your wife has a uterine infection at home? What trauma are you going to be able to be s partner and parent through? Because birth and babies and kids are physically traumatic.\n\nWhen we had our son, I didn't want to circumcise him.

It doesn\u2019t make the trauma go away. It can teach you better ways to manage it, enough so you can enjoy life again, but it\u2019s very easy to accidentally undo all of that hard work by overestimating yourself and pushing yourself too far.\n\nIf you had gone in that room and had a panic attack, while your wife had her abdomen wide open, it could\u2019ve caused a very serious safety concern. The medical staff needed to be able to focus on your wife\u2019s care, not wrangling her panicking husband. \n\nYour wife was understandably nervous and needed support, yes. *But you weren\u2019t the support she needed right then.* You would not have been able to safely provide her the support she really needed, and you did the right thing by stepping aside and letting her mother fill that role.", "YTA.

I agree with the previous sentiment in that this has sent a message to your wife. That when it comes right down to it, literally life-or-death, you opt not to be therefor your own self. And to give you some perspective, a c section is not an easy procedure. Your doctor is basically scooping out your innards to get to your uterus and palpite your baby into the world. I really do get that this is scary for you, but you are not the first man to feel this way. There are sedatives and all sorts of things they could have done for you if you had been open to the possibility. And frankly, since your wife told you that she was disappointed in you, as any woman will tell you, that is way worse than if she were angry with you. That means she is questioning shit between you two and that's dangerous for your relationship.  MIL does need to butt out though.

It\u2019s better her then my husband because I\u2019m not trying to make my focus on him during that time.

She\u2019s hurt because she had to do that without you, you got to be comfortable while she had to go through that without a partner. That\u2019s why you\u2019re an asshole. You put your own comfort above your wife and newborn. Birth is incredibly traumatic, you only experienced a fraction of the trauma your ex felt and refused to be there while your current wife went through it. She\u2019s also kind of an asshole for having her first baby with someone who clearly wasn\u2019t going to be there for her so I guess you\u2019re both to blame.

You failed.", "NAH- You seem to understand your limits and you explained your limits to your wife before she became pregnant.  \n\nYour wife did not understand how she would feel in the moment about your limits as she had not been pregnant before.  That's not your fault or hers.  Pregnancy and delivery is a way more complicated process emotionally and physically than people who haven't experienced it give it credit for.  When the actual time came she was probably scared and excited and wanted you to be there with her. She felt let down and disappointed that you couldn't do that for her due to your past trauma. \n\nThat being said, you missed it.  There is no going back and changing the past.  You also don't get to dictate how you're wife feels about that. Maybe some couples counseling would help after things settle down with the new baby.  But just like she shouldn't belittle the trauma of your ex almost dying in front of you during delivery, you shouldn't belittle hers. She put her life on the line to bring your child into this world while you safely sat in the waiting room.  She gets to feel about that however she wants.", "YTA.

I get that you had a hard time before and it was traumatic but it was your ex wife that actually went through that hell not you and then instead of sucking it up to support your current wife you abandoned her when she needed you the most. Honestly I don't see any way that you can make this up to her tbh, and if I was her there'd be a divorce coming pretty soon.", "NTA. She went into everything, even before she decided to have a C-section, knowing that OP could not be in the operating room. Is this a crappy agreement? Yes. It would be one thing if she planned for a vaginal birth with him there and learned late that she medically could not. This is not the case here. He made himself clear multiple times, before and throughout the pregnancy. She agreed to this each time he brought it up. \n\nThere are quite a few T A H here.

I doubt your therapist would want you to stay out of operating rooms indefinitely, and it seems like you\u2019ve had at least 9 months and probably more like years to tackle this. This would have been a golden opportunity to try. I don\u2019t think your wife was asking out of some nefarious \u201cgotcha\u201d type moment.

You stayed as close by as you could. \n\nMoving forward, you should bring your wife to therapy with you so you can talk it out.  Being there for her means so much more than one surgery.

As a high risk pregnant person, I was scared and anxious and he was my comfort. I didn\u2019t want my mother anywhere near me. Even if your wife agreed initially, when you\u2019re facing this big scary thing, sometimes you realize you are less brave than you thought. \n\nI also understand the limitations that trauma can cause. Trauma is a physical thing that impacts your body and your brain. Even if you could have made yourself be present for her, your legitimate trauma response isn\u2019t what she needed in that time.

On one hand, he was upfront and trying with therapy but Maybe on the other hand her fear kicked in... one of those you never know until that moment type of things... But now I think its one of those possibility vs probability things. In her mind especially. Like when a spouse cheats, its like you knew in general it was possible, but know you know they havr and the probability and likelihood of them betraying you again increases. Similarly, she knew it was a possibility that he might not be able to enter the room, but now its a high probability that he'll shut down again and likely at a time of an emergency, be it her or their kid - regardless of the reason... Either way though MIL needs to mind her mouth and manners, let them sort it out and decide how to handle moving forward.", "NTA. This is an unfortunate situation for you and your wife to end up in. You told us you were clear from the beginning about your boundaries and your wife accepted those boundaries going into the pregnancy. More importantly, you did what was safe. I work in the peri-anesthesia unit in a hospital and I can promise you that staying out of the operating room was the right call. If you had ended up having some sort of physical or mental crisis in there during the procedure, you would have taken time and resources away from your wife and daughter when they were in a very precarious situation. Even with modern medicine, childbirth is dangerous and things can go wrong quickly. \n\nYour wife is NTA either. She was pregnant, and scared, and you shouldn\u2019t blame her for asking you to go in with her at the last second. Pregnancy/labor/childbirth do absolutely insane things to the human body and mind, even into the postpartum period where you are now. I think it\u2019s best to sit down and have an open discussion where you both allow each other to fully express your feelings from the delivery day and since without judgment. It\u2019s important to be a cohesive team for your daughter in her most vulnerable stage of life now.\n\nYour mother-in-law is the AH. There is no benefit to anyone from her badmouthing you to the rest of the family. A lot of dads do shitty things when their partner is giving birth, but you didn\u2019t.

Sure you said it before so she technically should have been aware of that boundary, but I think she deserves a little grace given she was in labor and all the hormones, fear, anticipation, etc can make you a little loopy. I think you guys need to talk this through and you'll have to calmly explain your boundary again and that it seems from a real trauma that you have and are working through. Did she cross a line by telling people in the family who don't have full context for it? Absolutely. I think you need to calmly explain to her why that wasn't cool. I know all of this is asking you to be the bigger person and remain calm when she wasn't able to do so, but she just gave birth and is probably still really vulnerable physically and emotionally.

However, birth trauma is a real thing for mothers AND fathers, and it could well be true that you being there could have been more stress for everyone involved if you began to panic etc. You know yourself best and that is fine. \n\nThe main thing is you now have a beautiful, healthy daughter.

But if the result is that she had to give birth like a single mother, then there is no big deal to her to become a single mother.", "NTA. I'm delivering via C-section this Monday and would not want my husband there if he has severe trauma that might be more stressful in the OR. Also, I'm a nurse if that matters. Of course I'd love my husband to be by my side, but it's a sacrifice. ALSO, where I'm at (Los Angeles), the anesthesiologist is responsible for me and my husband in the event he passes out from watching the surgery or any other medical emergency he might experience. I would not want the anesthesiologist that is managing me.. someone that is a life/death situation (especially if anesthesia meds go wrong!) .. to have to worry about someone else that was 100% avoidable. Everyone saying YTA is assuming you're traumatized by the actual surgery itself, but you specified your ex was between life/death and that's INCREDIBLY traumatizing. \n\nYou did everything right. You and your wife communicated ahead of time and agreed on a plan. She chose to ask anyway and was disappointed in the result.

It\u2019s unfair to put him in a situation over something she chose, it would be even worse if she did need it for medical reasons and he would definitely not handle it well. You both should\u2019ve attended therapy to understand this more and how you\u2019d go about it if she did need it for an emergency or if she\u2019d simply want you there BEFORE AND DURING pregnancy.

It\u2019s way different than being in a waiting room. \n\nHave any of you ever been in an operating room before? They\u2019re not a calming place.

That\u2019s his baggage but it\u2019s not his fault.", "It\u2019s hard to say that either of you were the AH. You did state your boundary from the beginning and your wife probably did think she would be okay without you being there.

I had an elective c section 6 months ago and was fine till they took me back and then I started panicking so I can understand why she feels abandoned.

My husband has a serious problem with blood and such due to his time in the military. So when I decided to have a c section we had a talk about if he could handle being there or not, he said as long as he couldn\u2019t see anything he should be fine and he wanted to be there for our daughter and me. He spent the time focusing on me and cracking jokes with the anesthesiologist, and for the most part he handled it far better than I thought he would even though there was a small complication.

You are in therapy attempting to address this issue for yourself, so it's not like you aren't making an effort. In your shoes, I would be disappointed in your partner for going back on an agreement you both made together and attempting to guilt and shame you over it. \"Your needs are only okay until I change my mind and decide to disagree with them\" is NOT an acceptable dynamic regardless of gender. It's okay to ASK your partner for a change to a previous mutually accepted decision.

It kind of depends how long the cold behavior lasts, but people giving birth get a pass on most behaviors.

Keep being there for your wife and baby, and keep reminding her that you didn't abandon her, you were making sure you wouldn't be causing a problem in the operating room.

Not fair, not considerate of her. A loving partner would not demand and gaslight their partner into experiencing another trauma even for the birth of their child. For those who will be pressed, I had a C-section so I know what I'm talking about. Respecting a person's boundaries goes both ways. Her demanding he is there is not a boundary, it's a wish/request at best, or an attempt to control his behavior at worst. I understand she felt like she needed him, as it is a scary and difficult process, even with a usually happy outcome, but it shouldn't be at the expense of his mental health. He did his best and she should be grateful he respected her enough to share his boundary with her. She chose to disrespect his boundary. She is the AH.", "Absolutely NTA.

In a couple weeks once her hormones have stabilized and the emotions of the birth have worn off all will be well.

He should be disappointed in her smh\n\nIf his wife wanted him with her, then she shouldn\u2019t have chosen to get a c-section. Simple as that.", "NAH\u2014 you have a valid reason you didn\u2019t want to go in there, and you were very honest about it early on. She was going through a really emotional and scary experience and wished you were there. But you didn\u2019t choose not to go in for some lame reason like \u201csorry babe, i\u2019m kinda tired rn\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what would\u2019ve happened if you went in. Maybe something would\u2019ve taken over in your mind and let you be very helpful to her. Maybe the trauma would\u2019ve kicked in and caused you to make things actively worse and scarier for her.\n\nNeither of you can change it, you just have to be there for her now. Acknowledge & validate her own feelings of abandonment\u2014 even if she knew what she was going into she doesn\u2019t truly know what she\u2019s going into if she\u2019s never been in this situation before.", "He\u2019s not talking like his feelings matter more than hers, but you are implying that hers matter more than his.\n\nThe OR staff did not need him in there freaking out. It was better he wasn\u2019t there. He was up front about this trauma, and his wife agreed that he wouldn\u2019t be in there. He didn\u2019t abandon her, he was right there. Women have been giving birth for centuries with the fathers banned from the birth room. This is on her, not him.", "Uh no. She agreed twice! She chose the c-section, that\u2019s her choice. But she knew and still chose anyway. That\u2019s on her. You cannot be having anyone with PTSD in an operating room. There is no room for error during an operation of this caliber. It\u2019s not his fault he has a mental illness from a past event. She can be mad but she\u2019s absolutely wrong", "Yeah, absolutely agree. OP communicated his limitations and wife still chose an elective c-section then got upset when OP stuck to his boundary. Wtf?", "Being scared of blood and having PTSD are extremely different.", "Talk with your own doctor and ask for antianxiety meds.", "So sorry for your loss. I agree with others re therapy, and if you can find someone who does EMDR, it's a very effective treatment for trauma.", "Hire a birth doula to help through the process and work with the staff to best accommodate you. Some hospitals will allow an extra person in the OR in these cases in case you need to leave or something goes sideways to support you both. Also, EMDR therapy can do wonders for sensory triggers like light, sound, and smells that you may not be aware of as triggers when they happen.", "I have one daughter, went in on a *planned* C-section.  Never. Ever. Ever.  I would not do it again.  There were 2 nurses standing next to me the entire time, thus taking their time so this idiot could what..pretend to be supportive?  40 years ago, still resonates.\n\nGood kid though, shame about the ex lol.  Nah, she\u2019s cool.", "Lol that\u2019s true. I should know that, two of my kids were C-sections. It was around 30 years ago though", "This is how both of mine were too.", "That\u2019s a giant leap based on lacking information.", "Good suggestion."]}
