When my ex-wife had her c-section, she had a complication and hovered between life and death for a long time. It was a horrible experience to feel so helpless. \n\nCurrently, I deal with this in therapy, several things have improved, but going into an operating room is a big no-no for me. When my ex had our second child, I was very nervous and she asked me to wait outside the operating room. \n\nWhen my current wife and I decided to try to have children, I made it very clear that I didn't care what her choice of delivery was, but c-section I would not enter, but that I would stay by her side at all times except for operation. She agreed and eventually became pregnant. \n\nShe decided in the middle of the pregnancy that it would be a c-section and I said that was fine, but I remembered my limitation. She understood and invited her mother to take my place. \n\nOn the day of the surgery, before she had an c-section, she asked me to come in with her, because she wanted a moment of our own. \n\nI apologized, but that this was my limit and that I couldn't. She said \"Fine, I'll go with my mother then\" and had a crying face. I tried talking to her but to no avail and my MIL kept looking at me disguting.\n\nAnyway, I don't think it would have been a hell, because I was very nervous and it definitely wouldn't have helped at all inside the operating room.\n\n Everything went well and our daughter was born beautiful and healthy. I was already at the exit of the operating room waiting for them and I didn't leave their side. \n\nLater, when we were alone, my wife said that I abandoned her at a vulnerable time and left her alone when she needed me most. I tried talking to her, but she said that now we need to focus on our daughter, but that she was disappointed in me as a partner. \n\nApparently my MIL told family members what I did and I'm being criticized. \n\nMy wife and I have only talked about the baby and this has been going on for a week now. \n\nAITA?\n\nExtra: In the case of my ex, it was a c-section in parts mandatory (the first no, the second yes) and my wife's elective. Yes, in my country, c-section can be a choice, as long as the pregnant woman is aware of the risks.", "created_utc": 1690040201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156n9q2/aita_for_not_staying_with_my_wife_during_her/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You set a boundary up for a very specific reason. It wasn\u2019t because of a \u201ceww gross\u201d reason.

My poor husband was traumatized and I asked him to leave with the baby while they did spinal surgery on me. Just because I was scared doesn\u2019t mean I wanted to traumatized him more. Not everyone can handle watching their loved ones be cut open and you let her know well ahead of time and you are working on it in therapy. I am honestly shocked by the ones calling you an ah. I mean are men not allowed to be traumatized these days or is it only reserved for women? You don\u2019t get to put a time frame on other peoples healing or decide what is traumatizing for someone.", "This is a tricky one because it involves trauma you\u2019re trying to deal with and you set boundaries but also involves being a parent/having a partner and needing to learn to put your own shit to the side. \n\nFor the ones that said you set your boundaries beforehand, that would be okay in other circumstances but this involves a baby and a wife. Your wife can be seen as an AH for agreeing to do it when you said you wouldn\u2019t go in the room with her. But people agree and then when they\u2019re in the situation, emotions over take them. This is one of those situations that would be worth reconsidering your boundary on that. \n\nWhat were you doing for nine months that you could have worked on trying to be in the room with her and dealing with your trauma? What if your child needed surgery and they needed you in the room? Would you put yourself before them? You can\u2019t anymore. Your children\u2019s needs matter first before your own.

Now she's upset.\n\nOP, you're not the asshole but she did just have major surgery and a bunch of hormone changes right now.

I got a splinter doing yard work, it was terribly painful \ud83d\ude23. Until I'm able to work through the trauma, I will not touch a rake. That is my boundary. Sure, someone else has to pick up my slack, and may grow to resent me. But I made my boundary clear so I'm not NTA. And neither are you. It's just that our feelings are more important than others.", "NTA. If you are anything like me, them having to pick me up off the OR floor where I passed out, would not be helpful. I almost fainted looking at an x-ray. You did what you were able to.", "NAH. You clearly explained your limit to your wife way before she became pregnant. But I also get her imploring for you to by her side in her deep moment of needing you. I feel very sad for her not having her husband next to her while going through a very scary experience. Was your trauma greater than hers in that moment? Only you will know and I wish you both luck in getting past this.", "Nta", "YTA. You described feeling nervous when you go into an operating room. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t sound really serious. I mean, your wife was probably nervous too.", "NTA this wasn't an emergency c-section where you were the only support person available. You had a reasonable boundary, she opted for an elective c-section knowing that boundary, you had a plan to make sure she was supported and she's the one who changed her mind.", "I came fully prepared to say YTA, but I won\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019ll go with NAH, because I empathise with both sides, even though you clearly expressed yourself. \n\nI got to wonder though, why is it so bad for you?", "YTA.

Bet your wife, you know, the one going through life-altering surgery that almost lost her life last time, was scared shitless too. All she wanted was you. YTA.

That's on her.", "YTA she could die and was afraid.!", "YTA, while you made your desire clear, you were still selfish and abandoned your wife.

You had no business having a child with her.", "YTA- having a C-section was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life, even with my husband there holding my hand through the entire thing. Of course you don\u2019t WANT to be there to witness your wife having a major surgery. But if you felt scared, uncomfortable, helpless- how tf do you think your wife felt while having 7 layers of her body cut through and her baby yanked out while she was awake? Because you couldn\u2019t handle just standing next to her and holding her hand when she needed you most in life. News flash OP- no one likes the hospital or going into an operating room.", "NAH, except for MIL. She's the AH of this story. \n\nYour trauma and experiences are valid and if you had a reaction during the procedure it would have detracted from the medical staff from focusing on your wife to get you out of the room. Anyone telling you to \"man up\" is disregarding your trauma.\n\nOn the flip side, your wife was probably terrified. C-sections are traumatic in their own right and she could have died during birth regardless of which method she chose. At the end of the day, her life was the one at risk so I can't blame her for being scared in the moment.\n\nI guess what I wonder is why a compromised couldn't be reached. You go in and talk with her a bit before the procedure starts then exit the room. Is simply going into ORs a trigger for you?\n\nRegardless, ask her to join you for a therapy session or look into couple's therapy to discuss and work through this issue before resentment truly builds. At this point it's about working through the issue.", "YTA\n\nYou abandoned your wife during one if the most stressful and dangerous parts of her life. You should have found a way to be with her. \n\n\nWhat's with the NTA votes? On what planet is SHE the asshole for needing her husband while delivering his child? She would have delivered alone had her mom not been with her!", "ESH. You could have found a way to manage being there with her. But it also sounds like this was an elective c-section that she chose knowing your situation. I find it odd that someone would choose a c-section if it's not medically necessary in the first place.", "NAH. Seems to be a lot of keyboard warriors or just man-haters in these comments. You have trauma, and you're actively trying to heal, AND your wife agreed beforehand.\n\nSeems a lot of people in these comments don't understand how bad hospital PTSD can be, I went through a horrific event this year and I'm not over it at all.\n\nI will say though, I personally would fight through the trauma to try and be there for my partner, and I do feel your wife's frustration, but I still don't think you fucked up.", "NTA", "I  don't think you are... You're been through something very traumatic and only you know how hard that is to deal with. The thing about pregnant women is there absolutely mean as hell... I was one, I hated everyone and everything..  didn't matter what they said or did I hated them... I will say I did hold alot against my partner when now I know I was being unreasonable. Pregnant women go through alot and if its her first she will have been absolutely crapping bricks! But you'd already explained all of the issues so personally I think your wife and her family need to see it from your side and stop being so judgemental!", "YTA to me. If my husband couldn\u2019t be in the operating room for me in that situation, I think it would completely change the way I look at him. I think I would become too resentful to even continue the relationship. I couldn\u2019t imagine going through something that traumatic, while my husband couldn\u2019t simply stand there. To me, that\u2019s the equivalent of my father dying and my husband telling me \u201chey I can\u2019t go to the funeral because that will be too sad for me.\u201d Like I said though, that\u2019s just my perspective. Everybody is going to have their own perspective. I would really consider your wife\u2019s perspective, because if it\u2019s the same as mine, your absence in the operating room will destroy your relationship with her- so ask yourself if that\u2019s worth it.\n\nAlso, think about what you\u2019re saying about your past trauma. You\u2019re legit telling your wife \u201cif this becomes a life or death situation, I don\u2019t want to be in the room while you die. It\u2019ll be too sad for me.\u201d You\u2019re telling her you care more about your feelings than being there for your wife in her last few moments of life (if she were to die).", "Im going to go against the grain and say YTA. Her body went through so much change and stress and pain with the pregnancy alone, and then she's the one getting her stomach cut open to bring your child into the world, but you couldn't muster to strength to just stand next to her for a couple of minutes to support her? You're \"nervous\" but she's the one getting literally CUT open. Did you even think about that? You sound incredibly self-absorbed.", "YTA. Suck it up. Your wife is going through hell and asked you for one thing.", "YTA. You're willing to working through your \"issues\" for your nose job, but not to be with your wife while your child is being born.

You had made sure she was aware you wouldn't be in there if she had a c section multiple times. And not just that you had a valid reason. I had a c section and my partner was in there with me.

The MIL is kind of an AH tho..", "Dude\u2026NTA. \n\nPeople\u2019s comments are acting like she didn\u2019t agree to it.

Give me a fucking break. \n\nPeople are acting like you can choose to shut off your anxiety and trauma. She AGREED to it! Multiple times.

You could have been with her and then left before she actually got cut open. Learn to compromise or your marriage will fall apart. YTA.", "NTA. You placed your limit , she was aware of it, and you stood by it. Her mother was there. Now, if the situation had been extra stressful because your MIL had gotten in a car crash on the way to the hospital and your wife had been worrying and alone, then, yeah, I think a discussion on whether to overstep your limits can be had.

You're being a shit partner for not being there for her and she's being a shit partner for wanting you to break a boundary you set ahead of time. \n\n I've had a very traumatic vaginal birth and an emergency c-section. Both were scary, painful, and traumatic for different reasons. Giving birth tends to be ugly and traumatic and if you can't cope, what's going to happen if your wife has a uterine infection at home? What trauma are you going to be able to be s partner and parent through? Because birth and babies and kids are physically traumatic.\n\nWhen we had our son, I didn't want to circumcise him.

It doesn\u2019t make the trauma go away. It can teach you better ways to manage it, enough so you can enjoy life again, but it\u2019s very easy to accidentally undo all of that hard work by overestimating yourself and pushing yourself too far.\n\nIf you had gone in that room and had a panic attack, while your wife had her abdomen wide open, it could\u2019ve caused a very serious safety concern. The medical staff needed to be able to focus on your wife\u2019s care, not wrangling her panicking husband. \n\nYour wife was understandably nervous and needed support, yes. *But you weren\u2019t the support she needed right then.* You would not have been able to safely provide her the support she really needed, and you did the right thing by stepping aside and letting her mother fill that role.", "YTA.

You could have made it more difficult & stressful by being there rather than being present before & after the event.

She understood and invited her mother to take my place. \n\nOn the day of the surgery, before she had an c-section, she asked me to come in with her, because she wanted a moment of our own. \n\nI apologized, but that this was my limit and that I couldn't. She said \"Fine, I'll go with my mother then\" and had a crying face. I tried talking to her but to no avail and my MIL kept looking at me disguting.\n\nAnyway, I don't think it would have been a hell, because I was very nervous and it definitely wouldn't have helped at all inside the operating room.\n\n Everything went well and our daughter was born beautiful and healthy. I was already at the exit of the operating room waiting for them and I didn't leave their side. \n\nLater, when we were alone, my wife said that I abandoned her at a vulnerable time and left her alone when she needed me most. I tried talking to her, but she said that now we need to focus on our daughter, but that she was disappointed in me as a partner. \n\nApparently my MIL told family members what I did and I'm being criticized. \n\nMy wife and I have only talked about the baby and this has been going on for a week now. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But he was there the entire time. There was a sheet between us and my lower extremities, so he couldn't see what was going on. I agree with the previous sentiment in that this has sent a message to your wife. That when it comes right down to it, literally life-or-death, you opt not to be therefor your own self. And to give you some perspective, a c section is not an easy procedure. Your doctor is basically scooping out your innards to get to your uterus and palpite your baby into the world. I really do get that this is scary for you, but you are not the first man to feel this way. There are sedatives and all sorts of things they could have done for you if you had been open to the possibility. And frankly, since your wife told you that she was disappointed in you, as any woman will tell you, that is way worse than if she were angry with you. That means she is questioning shit between you two and that's dangerous for your relationship.  MIL does need to butt out though. I think it's harsh to call you TA, but I DO think you need to take a long look at your role from her perspective and adjust your viewpoint accordingly.", "YTA.

You're allowed to have boundaries to avoid blatant triggers to your trauma. I don't get how someone can't understand that.

It\u2019s better her then my husband because I\u2019m not trying to make my focus on him during that time.

She\u2019s hurt because she had to do that without you, you got to be comfortable while she had to go through that without a partner. That\u2019s why you\u2019re an asshole. You put your own comfort above your wife and newborn. Birth is incredibly traumatic, you only experienced a fraction of the trauma your ex felt and refused to be there while your current wife went through it.

That's not your fault or hers.  Pregnancy and delivery is a way more complicated process emotionally and physically than people who haven't experienced it give it credit for.  When the actual time came she was probably scared and excited and wanted you to be there with her. She felt let down and disappointed that you couldn't do that for her due to your past trauma. \n\nThat being said, you missed it.  There is no going back and changing the past.  You also don't get to dictate how you're wife feels about that. Maybe some couples counseling would help after things settle down with the new baby.  But just like she shouldn't belittle the trauma of your ex almost dying in front of you during delivery, you shouldn't belittle hers.

I get that you had a hard time before and it was traumatic but it was your ex wife that actually went through that hell not you and then instead of sucking it up to support your current wife you abandoned her when she needed you the most.

She went into everything, even before she decided to have a C-section, knowing that OP could not be in the operating room. Is this a crappy agreement? Yes. It would be one thing if she planned for a vaginal birth with him there and learned late that she medically could not. This is not the case here. He made himself clear multiple times, before and throughout the pregnancy. She agreed to this each time he brought it up. \n\nThere are quite a few T A H here.

C-section is one of the few operations where a non staff member is allowed in the operating room so that is a bit of a reach.", "He was in the hospital, with his wife, until the operating room. He was waiting for her to be wheeled out. \n\nHow the hell do you interpret that as abandonment? No! It's doing the parts that he's capable of, FFS.", "There is but most people wait in the waiting area which I\u2019m gonna take a guess OP would do. He would be present. If his wife chooses to wait elsewhere again that is on her.", "He didn't know I was there but I knew. That's attention seeking behavior, virtue signaling, and rude of you to say when you don't have the same trauma OP has. \n\nHim being there is more important than making sure the medical team was focused on this man's wife and baby, not daddy having a panic attack and passing out? Sure, she's allowed to be disappointed he couldn't be there for her, but she also agreed to it and has no grounds for bullying, freezing him out, or letting her mother and family disrespect him for keep an agreed upon boundary. She agreed because she thought she could guilt or bully him into it when the time came. Surprise, she couldn't so now she's sulking and taking it out on him.", "But he did tell her. He set the expectation. I fully believe that if you\u2019re aware of something and choose to be hurt about it that is a you problem. Like I\u2019ve said if he sprung this on her last minute my vote would be different.", "But he didn\u2019t have anything like that with him because she was fine with their deal. What do you mean by \u201cenough time?\u201d He had no idea she was going to ask him to come in at the last minute because, again, they had already discussed this and she was fine with it. What are you saying? That he should have asked a rando doctor for propranolol when she suddenly changed her mind at the hospital? Or that he was supposed to somehow foresee that she was going to change her mind and bring some with him?", "You're assuming he's only working on it because of his pending surgery. Way to go out on a limb, but you do you. \n\nAnd drugging oneself to be present in a potentially life threatening situation seems counter-productive. Far better he be outside and capable than inside, non-functional, and perhaps even in the way of medical treatment.", "That may be true however I was able to watch my son surgery from a window. I just wanted him to know I was there.\n\nSo what are you gonna do if the child falls on his face covered in blood broken bone is he gonna be able to take the child to a hospital because he\u2019s so scared? This is my concern. She went in there without any blood or anything but he doesn\u2019t want to see the surgery in the blood and all of that.\n\nIn the military I saw 6 foot four grown men pass out while giving blood. And I always question what would they do in the battlefield when they see all that blood? Everybody handles emergency situation differently but when it\u2019s somebody you love I would hope that you would be able to step up and do what you can. \n\nHe didn\u2019t have to watch the surgery he could\u2019ve been there for her looked at her face stroked her face held her hand talk to her even if she\u2019s under he didn\u2019t have to watch the actual surgery but he just decided it wasn\u2019t worth his time.", "Were it allowed, I'd've had my partner in the OR while they prepped me for open-heart. Even that much wasn't permitted. \n\nI seriously don't get all the folks who are saying OP should be totes fine with sitting in the operating room. It's neither common, nor easy, and as you say, most of us do it alone.", "Lmfao at the last paragraph. Do you understand what those meds do? It removes the physical effects of anxiety and that\u2019s all. You\u2019re able to function exactly the same, better even. Hardly like popping a benzo.", "So, not in the operating room then, but waiting outside... \n\nlike OP for his wife. \n\nGot it.", "He has an issue with the operating room itself, not anything else. There is no indication that he wouldn't have been there for a vaginal delivery which is also bloody and messy. He was with his wife the entire time EXCEPT for the part where she was actually in the operating room. You are really straining to make him the jerk when it is clear he isn't.", "You're suggesting use of a drug primarily used for coronary and vascular issues, with off-label use for performance anxiety, to manage this. \n\nRoflmao. OP's problems are all solved. Don't worry about the hallucinations or diarrhea.", "I don\u2019t know what country he is in, I am in the US and a lot of the deliveries are in an operating room because they have the things that are needed in case things go wrong.\n\nI do question how he would take a vaginal delivery while she\u2019s screaming panting pushing because it\u2019s not pretty. Sometimes you think you can\u2019t go on.A baby just doesn\u2019t pop out and look all pink and Rosy. \n\nI know in many other countries a lot of deliveries are done in a birthing room without all of the surgical stuff or even at home. I had really terrible deliveries. Lasted for hours my first was 22 hours. They finally had to use forceps. So it sounds like he wouldn\u2019t have been much help there either. My husband never left my side. \n\nThings go wrong when birthing a child whether it be natural or surgical. This might\u2019ve been a good time for him to go in and try to be there for her if he couldn\u2019t stay then I understand but he didn\u2019t even make the effort.", "Do you realise how many drugs are prescribed for more than one thing? That stuff works wonders for anxiety, hence why it\u2019s very commonly prescribed for it. You realise how *rare* the hallucination side effects are right? And that almost every medication has rare side effects like that, right? Your ignorance is showing, love. Most people that have had this prescribed for anxiety will sing it\u2019s praises. For me, it was the difference between waking up in the morning mid panic attack vomiting for 3 hours and waking up and being able to go about a normal routine and get myself to work. I suggest doing some actual research into it before trying to form an opinion.\n\nEdited to add, it\u2019s not even [off label](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/propranolol/)", "Again you're making assumptions. His one caveat was that he can't go in the operating room full stop. She chose the operating room knowing this, so that's on her. To assume anything else is reaching and a rather pathetic attempt to paint him in a worse light."]}
