Age gap plus his own age make this a terrible idea.", "NTA. At all. For a start, friends are the family we choose. You have no obligation to one over the other.\n\nSecondly, you're right, the whole thing IS weird. I have a friend who's married to the guy that used to babysit her. They're happy, their relationship is stable, and they're great parents, so I wouldn't ever say anything to them. But it'll never not be impossibly weird to me. Sara, as the mother, has every right to be weirded out by it. And you have every right as her friend to stand by her.", "NTA. Your sister is a creep. She most likely changed this man\u2019s diapers when he was a baby.", "NTA, good lord.  39 to 21 is super-creepy.  Add in that she's known him since he was in diapers and it gets super-super creepy.  This isn't about picking sides, it's about not validating your sister's predatory behavior.", ">she was 18 when he was born. \n\nAnd she probably changed his diapers since his mother was her sister's best friend from childhood.  This is all kinds of levels of nasty.", "Exactly. If they were 18 years apart and met on a dating app or at a bar or whatever and your BFF found that creepy and told you not to go, I\u2019d see your mom\u2019s point. Relationships can be perfectly happy and healthy ones even if there\u2019s an age difference. But that\u2019s not any random guy, that\u2019s your best friend\u2019s SON. Your sister has known him since he was in diapers. She could have attended his baby shower. It\u2019s not just your best friend disapproving, your best friend is the groom\u2019s mother. And worst of all, your sister, who should have been the one to feel icky because to this guy she has always been a sexually mature adult but she can remember him as a child, was the one to pursue him.  That\u2019s the icky part a million trillion times more than the age difference, and frankly it\u2019s weird it\u2019s only you and your BFF who seem to be noticing this.", "Is this bait or are you just a creep", "Why in the world would you expect her to attend and support a marriage that you freely admit is 'creepy' and 'groomy'. Yes, both her sister and the young man she's marrying are adults, but that doesn't mean you have to pretend to be supportive.", "Nope, whether she attends or not is her business.", "no one is required to attend a wedding for any reason ever.", "So gross & creepy that she has known him since he was a newborn! Its also so weird that the mum sees nothing wrong with this!", "Yup, it's a trade off, I changed your diapers then, you can change mine when I'm older!", "SHE PROBABLY KNEW THIS KID IN THE FUCKING WOMB since she was LIFELONG FRIENDS WITH HIS MOM", "I say that from an outside perspective. I do not knwo anything about the personally. Maybe they really love each other. We are judging them wihtout much impout on that.\n\nThat is why i voted YTA. All we know is that they want to marry. According to OP nothing else sketchy is going on or it would have been mentioned.\n\nWhat we FEEL the story is might not what it is without further info about the relationship itself.", "Sure it is. But it is still the wedding of her sister. People generally expect the sister of the bride to be there.\n\nNot going is rude. They aren't even estranged. She just disagrees with the choice of groom which is none of her buisness in the first place.\n\nWith your argument 100% of the stuff on this subreddit is NTA because everything is a choice the poster can make for themselves. No legaility issues.", "Sure. She is not. As i said somewhere else. This argument can be used for every single post in this subreddit. As no one posts actually illegeal things.\n\nNot attending your sisters wedding, a sister you are close with, for feelings you have about the groom (thinking he is like a nephew)... is a bit egocentric. Sorry.", "Like when people say about normal age gap relationships \u201cPartner A could be Partner B\u2019s parent/babysitter/teacher!\u201d The entire flaw in that argument is that they weren\u2019t and met when they were consenting adults, so the possibility is moot. In this case that argument works because it is VERY MUCH NOT MOOT BUT A THING THAT HAPPENED.", "You would find my siblings rude then, since none of them were at my wedding. And the disagreement about the choice of groom is only part of it. OP\u2019s friend isn\u2019t going which is also important, since friends matter as much as family, if not more in some cases.", "What people? The guests who are only there for the food and wine? I\u2019m allergic to dogs so I wasn\u2019t able to attend my brother\u2019s wedding since he wanted his corgi there. Wasn\u2019t a big deal. No one was disappointed. They all just stuffed themselves with the roasted pork, from my cousin\u2019s description."]}
