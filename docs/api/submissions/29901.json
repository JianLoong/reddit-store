About a week ago when we were in bed and about to go to sleep, she asked if she could use my phone to finish a show she was watching because her phone\u2019s battery was low and she forgot her charger. I handed her my phone, told her the code, then turned around and went to sleep.\n\nSince that night, she regularly uses my phone to watch her shows and movies because my phone is better than hers. Last night, we were out to dinner and I left my phone in my car. Since everything has been happening all around the world, I\u2019ve been keeping up with the news. While we were waiting for a table and I didn\u2019t have my phone, I asked her if I could use hers to check on the latest news. She asked me where mine was and I answered I left it in the car. She suggested I wait until after dinner or go and get it then nothing but silence. I was confused and things got very awkward to the point the other people in the waiting area noticed. The awkwardness lasted through dinner because I was still confused and she was angry.\n\nAfter dinner as I was driving home, she texted to tell me I was an ass to put her in that position in public and that I should have accepted her hints before she had to say no. I didn\u2019t see the big deal but she\u2019s royally pissed at me and said I had alot of making up to do.\n\nWas I wrong to ask to use her phone after she\u2019s been using mine wherever she wanted?", "created_utc": 1698581359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j1ku1/aita_for_wanting_to_use_my_girlfriends_phone/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In hind sight I should have been outa there way quicker. She was a nut job. Bro get out. Red flag", "NTA. I would ask her why she is so against you using her phone, if she uses yours. I think it is normal to use each other phones in a relationship.", "NTA. It's pretty normal to use each other's phones in a relationship. Her reaction was extreme enough to warrant a follow-up conversation about why she is so against you using her phone and what she thinks you need to make up for. The obvious explanation is that she's hiding another guy from you,  but it's also possible that there's something else she doesn't want you inadvertently seeing because she's not ready to share it yet, or the last thing she had open on the browser was what she's getting you for Christmas, or porn or something. Or maybe she's got trust issues from some kind of incident before you two met.\n\nWhen you talk to her about it, you might also want to tell her that 'dropping hints' is a terrible way to communicate and she needs to just tell you whatever it is she wants you to know.", "NTA\n\nbut a huge red flag. She has stuff on her phone she does not want you to see. Another bloke on the go probably.", "INFO:  was she currently using her phone, or were you two chatting to pass the time?  The situation you described is wanting to use her phone to kill time while you waited - which meant *she* wouldn\u2019t have her own phone to do just that, and would be left bored without even you to talk to.\n\nEveryone is jumping to \u201cshe\u2019s hiding something / this is unfair since she uses your phone\u201d, but this situation is different from her using your phone in bed when 1) you weren\u2019t using it and 2) you were going to sleep anyway.", "NTA \n\nI think it\u2019s a fair request to ask if you could check something on her phone if she is happy to use yours. \n\nHowever I think if you are out together on a date, maybe she was annoyed that you\u2019d rather check on the news then engage with her? But to make other tables notice her awkwardness is very strange. So NTA", "NTA/ brother she\u2019s hiding something on there  unfortunately. The redirected anger at you is telling for this behaviour.", "NTA and maybe your phone just doesn\u2019t 9have enough charge on it the next few times she wants to use it to watch her little shows. \n\nWTF. \n\nAnd what is on her phone that she doesn\u2019t want you to see? Hmmm?", "Who the hell watches a full length movie on their phone? Like repeatedly as a primary device?", "NTA , seems like a reasonable request since she regularly uses yours. Also you asked permission it's not like you were doing on the DL", "Yeah that's so dodgy, something is afoot!", "Nta. Why does she get to use your phone but not the other way around? My husband and I don't touch each other's phones n but your gf set the precedent by using your phone.", "NTA. The reason she is using your phone is because she is snooping man. She feels guilty for what she is hiding so her mind is telling her your probably doing the same thing. So she\u2019s looking for evidence to ease her conscience. It\u2019s a form of projecting. Sorry man. You sound like a nice guy.", "NTA but do people in three month relationships really think it\u2019s normal to share their phone codes and passwords with their romantic partners? I find a lot of these responses surprising but maybe my partner and I are more private/respectful of each other\u2019s privacy than is the norm?\n\nI can\u2019t imagine giving someone free reign of my own phone in that way to begin with but I\u2019d gladly share my phone charger (also, I\u2019m never without my charger). I can imagine unlocking my phone to let a partner watch a particular video or read an article while we\u2019re together at most so I wonder how many folks would think badly if someone who never handed over passwords and codes and such to a romantic partner. \n\nBecause I\u2019m inclined to think you should change your code and not give it out again, and just buy her an extra charger to have at your house if this relationship continues.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sharing phones is something your relationship has been doing for awhile since she uses yours to watch stuff so you using hers to read the news shouldn't be a major thing and I'd be wondering what she had to hide if I was in your position.\n\nWhen I've been in long term relationships and someone wanted to google something or order food or w/e we just used whoevers phone was closest  it just seems normal to me.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she's really trying hard to hide something. Hate how she tried to gaslight you that it was your fault. I'd change the password on yours and don't share it if you want to keep seeing her. But honestly, that's a huge red flag she's putting in front of you", "NTA and what worries me more than you not getting to use her phone is the way she blamed it all on you afterwards. Not good.", "NTA... But also stop letting her use yours.\n\nHowever... It is a bit rude to be on your phone whilst being together \"on tour\"", "NTA", "NTA   \n\n\nYou asked she said no, you may have been confused but you moved on.  \n\n\nPeople are going ot say she is hiding something, which at 3 months into the relationship she might be its still a young relationship, would not be suprised if there are other people she is flirting with or seeing, but the fact she would not let you use h er phone is not evidence in its own of this, some people genuinly dont like giving access to their phone, for various different reasons.", "Nta.  She's hiding something.", "I agree. The only time my wife and I are more careful with our phones is around Christmas and birthdays since there are usually notification emails etc about presents we bought for each other.", "This. We use each other's phone as well.", "A future gymbro.", "Yeah this is what stood out to me too.\n\nShe uses his phone to watch tv in bed.\n\nHe wanted to use her phone to look at something non-urgent while they were out to dinner.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same.", "Somebody who also enjoys looking through *all* the folders on the phone", "Yep, it seems like a very strong reaction for her to get angry and ruin the whole dinner.
