I think it is normal to use each other phones in a relationship.", "NTA. It's pretty normal to use each other's phones in a relationship. Her reaction was extreme enough to warrant a follow-up conversation about why she is so against you using her phone and what she thinks you need to make up for. The obvious explanation is that she's hiding another guy from you,  but it's also possible that there's something else she doesn't want you inadvertently seeing because she's not ready to share it yet, or the last thing she had open on the browser was what she's getting you for Christmas, or porn or something. Or maybe she's got trust issues from some kind of incident before you two met.\n\nWhen you talk to her about it, you might also want to tell her that 'dropping hints' is a terrible way to communicate and she needs to just tell you whatever it is she wants you to know.", "NTA\n\nbut a huge red flag.

But to make other tables notice her awkwardness is very strange. So NTA", "NTA/ brother she\u2019s hiding something on there  unfortunately. The redirected anger at you is telling for this behaviour.", "NTA and maybe your phone just doesn\u2019t have enough charge on it the next few times she wants to use it to watch her little shows. \n\nWTF. \n\nAnd what is on her phone that she doesn\u2019t want you to see? Hmmm?", "Who the hell watches a full length movie on their phone? Like repeatedly as a primary device?", "NTA , seems like a reasonable request since she regularly uses yours.

My husband and I don't touch each other's phones n but your gf set the precedent by using your phone.", "NTA. The reason she is using your phone is because she is snooping man. She feels guilty for what she is hiding so her mind is telling her your probably doing the same thing. So she\u2019s looking for evidence to ease her conscience. It\u2019s a form of projecting. Sorry man. You sound like a nice guy.", "NTA but do people in three month relationships really think it\u2019s normal to share their phone codes and passwords with their romantic partners? I find a lot of these responses surprising but maybe my partner and I are more private/respectful of each other\u2019s privacy than is the norm?\n\nI can\u2019t imagine giving someone free reign of my own phone in that way to begin with but I\u2019d gladly share my phone charger (also, I\u2019m never without my charger). I can imagine unlocking my phone to let a partner watch a particular video or read an article while we\u2019re together at most so I wonder how many folks would think badly if someone who never handed over passwords and codes and such to a romantic partner. \n\nBecause I\u2019m inclined to think you should change your code and not give it out again, and just buy her an extra charger to have at your house if this relationship continues.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
