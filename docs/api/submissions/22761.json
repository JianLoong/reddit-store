They were a bit loud, which was a bit annoying, but they were kids and kids do that. \n\nI didn't really have a problem with them until they started ding dong ditching us. I don't even know if it could be considered ding-dong ditching because they literally kick the door like they're trying to impersonate the FBI. They hang out in front of our house and do it every 10-20 minutes, keep in mind they kick HARD. My sister was going to call the police in a fit of rage but I told her no, because talking to their parents or calling the police might make it worse. I don't know the kid's situation at home, confronting the parents might make it bad for them. \n\nBut they keep doing it, more often, and harder. There are literally dents and scuffs on the door ( I don't even know how its possible because the kids look 10), and I'm seriously getting annoyed, along with my siblings. They clearly don't see the security camera right in front of the door, so I know their intelligence is lacking, so I'm not gonna yell at them. So I wrote a sign in front of the door, kindly asking them to stop because my siblings work from home and it is extremely distracting. \n\nBut it keeps happening, they rip up the sign and spit on it. So I can't take it anymore, I slip on some socks and slippers and go next door to talk to the parents. The mom said it's not that big of a deal, my door wasn't seriously damaged, and that they were just kids and trying to have fun. And if its that distracting, I should put on some headphones. \n\nBut my last straw is when these kids mess with my package outside the door and shake it and throw the box against the stairs. I snap and decided to take screenshots of all the security footage of them being little menaces. \n\nI make a poster, with their face on it, the damage that they've done to them, and photo evidence of them being menaces. I type out \" Neighbours be on the lookout! Local doorstep gremlins may terrorize your front door!\" which I found funny at the time. I print it out and tape it all over the neighbourhood. My other neighbour finds it hilarious, because those kids have been doing the same to her and she confronted the parent too, and the parent did nothing. \n\nbut today I got a giant knock on the door, and it wasn't the little snot-nosed kids, it was the mom!\n\nshe called me a b-word and an ahole for humiliating her kids, she said that her kids were crying and were now to traumatized to go outside.

Well done \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA, except to the degree that you've already given the little fu\u00a2ker$ and their mom more leeway than they deserve. \"oH, bUt ThEy'Re JuSt KiDs hAvInG fUn!!!!\" Bullshit. Those are the kids who grow up to be sociopaths. Gather your evidence, call the cops.", "She humiliated her own kids. if she taught them how to act right they wouldn\u2019t be in a position to be humiliated", "*her kids were crying and were now to traumatized to go outside*. \n\nSo now the mother has to deal with them and be a parent, instead of whatever else she has been doing.\n\nI found your solution hilarious also, OP. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you tried to handle it with the parent which didn't help so you took the next best step. If this doesn't stop it though I think it might be time to involve the police.", "NTA. People always talk about gateway drugs, but what about gateway crimes? \n\nFor now they do this, but what about when they get older? If they aren\u2019t stopped now, then chances are this behavior would not only continue on, but escalate. \n\nThe mom\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t call the cops, as you clearly have mountains of proof.", "NTA\nI would have gone to the cops if the parents didn't want to take care of their problem. Especially after they destroyed YOUR property. You were much nicer than I would have been.", "NTA problem solved!!! I love it!!!", "NTA call the police. You have the evidence.", "Nta, mom.wont parent her kid, she deserves to be publicly shamed", "You solved the problem that Mom wouldn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t have to like the way you did it. \n\nShe had the opportunity & didn\u2019t take it. She humiliated her kids by not doing her job.\n\nNTA", "NTA - she needs to be a parent and get her kids under control", "NTA. Blahblahblah . . . so they don\u2019t want to go outside anymore? GOOD. Let them stay home and annoy their mom, she deserves it.", "NTA You gave her an opportunity to address the situation and she didn't.  So you took action. \n\nMight I also suggest a motion activated sprinkler?", "Phrasing!", "NTA. \n\nYou talked to kids.  You talked to the rude, ignorant Mom. \n\nMom and kids got what they deserved. Maybe, they will all learn to be better behaved in the future.\n\nBe ready to call the police tho - bc there will likely be retributiion - and keep those cameras rolling.", "NTA. Next time probably call the non emergency line. They messed with your mail which to my knowledge is a federal offense.", "NTA. Perfect solution!", "NTA. When the parents refuse to parent, you have to up the game a bit. I would let the Mom know that if she continues to refuse to parent her children, your next step will be to show your video footage of their destructive behavior to the cops.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nI have kids and I would be mortified if they behaved like this. The kids shouldn't have done it, their mum should have stopped them when you told her -- it's not as if you didn't give them chances.\n\nLove the poster. They definitely had it coming.", "NTA\n\nBut why did you think neighborhood humiliation was more acceptable than just calling the police? That's a weird move.", "NTA. Especially when you think about it, their kids, and either they are going to be old enough that the police can take action, or they won't be old enough and the police will simply tell you \"we can't do anything here\" because they'd be to young.\n\nSo your method worked great. In the long run, it really is harmless and might actually teach the little gremlins that if you don't want to be embarrassed, don't do embarrassing things.", "NTA. Really, if they stop going outside at all, you\u2019ve done a public good. Do it to the mom next time", "Gee, I wonder why those kids are so ill-behaved...NTA", "NTA and honestly You did those kids a favor because one of these days they're going to kick on the wrong door and it's going to freak out the homeowner and make them think it's a home invasion and they may shoot at and kill those kids. It's important that they learn that they can't just do that because not only is it rude to the homeowner but it puts their own lives at risk.", "NTA. \nMy aunt was telling me yesterday how this is a TikTok thing, kids violently kicking doors and scaring people to try and film a reaction. You said you have a camera, keep those pictures and videos. But if mom is no help, letting the police know might not be a bad idea. Sounds like the kids won\u2019t let up, and they damaged your package. I think you\u2019ve been more than lenient.", "NTA. If their \"activity\" was okay then it should be okay for everyone to know about it.", "NTA. You followed standard protocol (talked to parent) and nothing happened. Your posters were the equivalent of 'Talking to HR' and now mum's talking!\n\nI'd get the neighbours that have issues with the kids to 'gang up' if I were you and hit the police station for a report or two if it happens again.", "NTA. Do you share a landlord? She clearly doesn't care that her kids are doing property damage and ruining your and others' \"quiet enjoyment\" of the premises. Get their trashy asses evicted with your footage.\n\nMaybe then she'll parent, but it won't be your problem if she doesn't. It's not your concern to tolerate her kids' bullshit out of fear that they'll be abused by her. If you're actually worried about that, pair it with a call to CPS.", "NTA. If she were parenting her kids, they wouldn't have been \"humiliated.\" Poor, obnoxious, unsupervised little brats!\n\nThey had it coming (and now I want to listen to the Chicago soundtrack, lol).\n\nEdit: most definitely call the police. they destroyed personal property and you have everything on video.", "Hey, you put up fliers. It's not like you went nuclear and went on social media.
