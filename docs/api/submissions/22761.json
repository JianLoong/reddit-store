I don't even know if it could be considered ding-dong ditching because they literally kick the door like they're trying to impersonate the FBI. They hang out in front of our house and do it every 10-20 minutes, keep in mind they kick HARD. My sister was going to call the police in a fit of rage but I told her no, because talking to their parents or calling the police might make it worse. I don't know the kid's situation at home, confronting the parents might make it bad for them. \n\nBut they keep doing it, more often, and harder. There are literally dents and scuffs on the door ( I don't even know how its possible because the kids look 10), and I'm seriously getting annoyed, along with my siblings. They clearly don't see the security camera right in front of the door, so I know their intelligence is lacking, so I'm not gonna yell at them. So I wrote a sign in front of the door, kindly asking them to stop because my siblings work from home and it is extremely distracting. \n\nBut it keeps happening, they rip up the sign and spit on it. So I can't take it anymore, I slip on some socks and slippers and go next door to talk to the parents. The mom said it's not that big of a deal, my door wasn't seriously damaged, and that they were just kids and trying to have fun. And if its that distracting, I should put on some headphones. \n\nBut my last straw is when these kids mess with my package outside the door and shake it and throw the box against the stairs. I snap and decided to take screenshots of all the security footage of them being little menaces. \n\nI make a poster, with their face on it, the damage that they've done to them, and photo evidence of them being menaces. I type out \" Neighbours be on the lookout! Local doorstep gremlins may terrorize your front door!\" which I found funny at the time. I print it out and tape it all over the neighbourhood.
